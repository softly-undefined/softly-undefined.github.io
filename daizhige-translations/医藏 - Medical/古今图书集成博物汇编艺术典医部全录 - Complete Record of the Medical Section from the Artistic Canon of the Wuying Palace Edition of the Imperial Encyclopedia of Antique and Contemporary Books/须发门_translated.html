<p><strong>Section on Hair and Beard [Commentary by Mao]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Pure Nature of Ancient Times</strong></p>
<p>When a girl reaches seven years old, her kidney energy is abundant, and her teeth change and hair grows longer.<br>[Note: Blood is the essence of the kidneys, and hair is a surplus of blood; hence, the hair grows longer.] At four to seven years, the muscles and bones are strong, and hair grows to its fullest length.<br>[Note: When essence and blood are at their peak, the muscles and bones are strong, and hair grows to its fullest length.] At five to seven years, hair begins to fall out. At six to seven years, it begins to turn white.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: The Yangming channel follows the hairline, thus when it weakens, hair falls out. Blood vessels flourish in color; when they weaken, hair turns white.</p>
<p>A man’s kidney energy is strong at eight years, causing hair to grow longer and teeth to change. By fifty-eight, kidney energy weakens, hair falls out, and teeth decay.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The kidney is the origin of vitality. When a man lacks energy, his foundational force deteriorates first, leading to hair fall and tooth decay.</p>
<p>By sixty-eight, Yang energy depletes in the upper part of the body, causing hair to turn white at the temples. By eighty-eight, both hair and teeth are lost.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: After a certain age, deterioration is extreme; hence, not only does hair turn white and become brittle but it also falls out.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On the Six Organs and Their Symbols</strong></p>
<p>The lungs are the source of qi and the place of the corporeal soul, with their essence manifesting in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The lungs govern the skin and hair; thus, their essence is found in hair.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern storage and are the foundation of essence, with their essence manifesting in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Hair is the excess of blood; blood is transformed from essence, hence the essence is found in hair.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The lungs combine with the skin; their essence is in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Hair is attached to skin; when qi is abundant, hair flourishes. The kidneys combine with bones; their essence is in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The kidneys store essence and govern the marrow, hence their connection is to bones. Hair is the excess of essence and blood; thus, its essence is in hair.</p>
<p>Eating too much bitterness causes the skin to wither and hair to fall out.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Bitterness is a flavor of fire; excessive intake harms the lungs, leading to withered skin and falling hair.</p>
<p>Eating too much sweetness results in bone pain and hair loss.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Sweetness is a taste of earth, and excessive sweetness harms the kidneys, causing bone pain and hair loss.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Weakness:</strong><br>The lungs govern the skin and hair of the whole body; therefore, when lung heat is intense, the skin and hair become weak and thin. Lung heat manifests as a pale complexion and damaged hair.</p>
<p><strong>Needling Explanation:</strong><br>Human hair, teeth, ears, and eyes correspond to the five sounds, aligning with the five tones and six rhythms. The hair and teeth count as six, with teeth being counted in pairs, but the number of hair cannot be quantified. The numeration of rhythms can extend to the thousands, but beyond ten thousand cannot be counted.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Regulating Menstruation:</strong><br>Evil influences affecting the body arise subtly from the hair and skin.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Long Needle Techniques:</strong><br>When sick from a strong wind, the hair and eyebrows fall, referred to as &#39;great wind.&#39; This great wind is a harsh wind, damaging the blood and energy from the muscles, hence the falling of hair and eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>Lingshu Classic:</strong><br>In the Spring, the energy is present in the hair. The interaction of yin and yang begins at the skin and hair, entering the muscles and bones from the outside in. The ultimate end of the great yin is when the skin and hair are burnt, leading to an end.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Meridians Chapter</strong></p>
<p>When the qi of the Hand Taiyin is depleted, the skin and hair become scorched. The Taiyin is responsible for circulating qi and warming the skin and hair; hence, when the qi is not nourishing, the skin and hair scorch. When the skin and hair scorch, the fluids are lost from the skin and joints; when the fluids are lost from the skin and joints, the nails wither, and the hair breaks. When the hair breaks, it is the hair that dies first. The fire dominates the metal as both Bingtian and Dingtian perish.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The qi of the Hand Taiyin governs the skin and hair; thus, when the qi of the Taiyin is depleted, the skin and hair scorch. The Hand Taiyin governs qi, which influences and moistens the skin and fur; thus, the Taiyin is responsible for circulating qi and warming the skin and hair. Therefore, when the qi is not nourishing, the skin and hair scorch. The fluids are released through the Sanjiao to warm the muscles, moisten the bones and joints, and hydrate the skin. When the qi does not nourish, the fluids are lost from the skin and joints, leading to withered nails and broken hair. The hair dying first indicates the depletion of the qi of the Hand Taiyin externally. Bingtian and Dingtian dying signify the death of the lung&#39;s qi internally.</p>
<p>When the qi of the Foot Shaoyin is depleted, the pulse becomes obstructed; when the pulse is obstructed, the blood does not flow; when the blood does not flow, the color of the hair lacks luster.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Blood flows along with the pulse qi, and hair is produced from blood qi; thus, if the blood and pulse do not flow, the hair color lacks luster.</p>
<p>When the qi of the Foot Shaoyin is depleted, the bones dry out, and the hair loses its luster. When the hair loses its luster, the bones die first.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The kidneys store essence and transform it into blood; hair is a surplus of blood. When the hair loses its luster, the essence and qi of the kidneys are depleted, leading to the death of the bones first.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Cold and Heat Illness Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If the skin is cold and hot, it should not be in contact with bedding; the hair is scorched, and the nose is dry and waxy.<br>[Note: The illness is in the skin, hence it should not be in contact with bedding. The blood and qi of the skin nourish the hair; therefore, if the skin qi is harmed, the hair is scorched. The lungs govern the skin and hair and open in the nose, thus the nose becomes dry and withered.]<br>If the muscles are cold and hot, there is muscle pain, the hair is scorched, and the lips are dry and waxy.<br>[Note: The external blood and qi fill the skin and heat the flesh, generating fine hair; therefore, if there is illness in the muscles, the muscles will hurt and the hair will be scorched.]</p>
<p><strong>Heat Illness Chapter</strong></p>
<p>In mania, the hair is lost and blood is sought from the heart.<br>[Note: Mania refers to the percussion pulse of mania. The hair is an excess of blood; if in mania the hair is lost, one must seek blood from the heart.]</p>
<p><strong>Five Transformations Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Wind, rain, cold, and heat enter through the fine hair into the pores.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Organs Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys connect with the Sanjiao and bladder. The Sanjiao and bladder correspond with the pores and fine hair. If the skin is tense and lacks fine hairs, the Sanjiao and bladder are urgent; if the fine hair is beautiful and coarse, the Sanjiao and bladder are straight; sparse fine hair indicates stagnation in the Sanjiao and bladder.<br>[Note: The energy of the sun governs the skin and hair. This classic states: &quot;The essence of the skin fills the body and moistens the hair; this is called qi.&quot; Therefore, both skin and hair correspond to the Sanjiao and bladder. It further states: &quot;The spleen generates flesh, flesh generates the lungs, and the lungs generate the skin and hair.&quot;]</p>
<p><strong>Life Expectancy Chapter</strong></p>
<p>At the age of forty, prosperity declines, and the hair turns mostly white.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>[Note: The emergence of white hair signifies a decline in the Yangming and Shaoyin energies.]</strong><br><strong>Twenty-Five Treatise on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Above the foot of the Taiyang, when blood and qi are abundant, the eyebrows are beautiful, featuring fine hair; when blood is plentiful but qi is scarce, the eyebrows are unattractive, and the face bears many fine lines. <strong>[Note: The meridian of the foot Taiyang originates at the inner canthus of the eye, follows along both eyebrows, and intersects at the crown. Thus, when the blood and qi of the skin are abundant, the eyebrows look beautiful and are adorned with fine hair. The fine hair is the long hair found within the eyebrows, which grows due to the richness of blood and qi. Unattractive eyebrows lack vitality and appear haggard. The presence of many fine lines on the face indicates insufficient qi, leading to a lack of moisture in the skin.]</strong> </p>
<p>Above the foot of the Yangming, when blood and qi are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long; when blood is scarce but qi is plentiful, the beard is short; when qi is scarce and blood is abundant, the beard is sparse; when both blood and qi are insufficient, there is no beard, and the lips are heavily marked. Below the foot of the Yangming, when blood and qi are abundant, the body hair is beautiful and long down to the chest; when blood is plentiful but qi is scarce, the body hair is beautiful but short, reaching only to the navel; when both blood and qi are insufficient, there is no hair, and if any exists, it is sparse and withered. <strong>[Note: The meridian of the foot Yangming ascends, encircling the mouth and lips, crossing at the chin. Therefore, when the skin is filled with blood and qi, the beard appears beautiful and long; with scarce blood and abundant qi, the beard is short; with scarce qi and abundant blood, the beard is sparse; when both blood and qi are deficient, there is no beard. Abundant blood permeates the skin and facilitates the growth of fine hair. Qi nourishes the skin, moistening the body’s hair; thus, the facial hair above and the fine hair below all rely on the skin’s blood and qi for growth.]</strong><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>When the blood and qi are deficient, they cannot sufficiently nourish the skin and its pores, resulting in pronounced lines around the lips; this indicates that the muscles are not well-filled, leading to numerous thin lines. The pathway of the Yangming meridian in the foot descends, traveling from the chest below the navel, along the kneecap to the foot; therefore, when the blood and qi in the lower skin are abundant, the hair below is beautiful and long up to the chest. If the blood is abundant but the qi is deficient, the hair is beautiful but short, reaching only to the navel. If both blood and qi are deficient, there is no hair at all, and if present, it is sparse and frail. In contrast, for the Shaoyang above, when the blood and qi are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long. If there is more blood and less qi, the beard is beautiful but short. If there is less blood and more qi, there is little beard, and when both blood and qi are deficient, there is no beard at all.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>When the energy of the lesser yang of the foot is vigorous, the leg hair is long and beautiful, the external ankle is plump; when there is more blood and less energy, the leg hair is short and beautiful, the outer ankle skin is firm and thick. When there is little blood and much energy, the leg hair is sparse, and the outer ankle skin is thin and soft. When both blood and energy are deficient, there is no hair, and the outer ankle is thin with little flesh.</p>
<p>(Note: The meridian of the lesser yang of the foot rises, following the front and back of the ear, travels to the cheekbone, and moves down to the neck. Thus, when the blood and energy in the skin are abundant, facial hair is long and beautiful. When there is more blood and less energy, facial hair is short but beautiful, as hair and beard are a surplus of blood. The descending meridian circulates down the outer side of the knee, along the front of the fibula, reaching the tip of the fibula, then exits before the outer ankle, and travels up the foot. Therefore, in the lower part of the body, when the blood and energy in the flesh of the skin are abundant, the leg hair is long and beautiful; when there is abundant blood and a plump ankle, the skin is firm and thick. Conversely, when there is little blood, the skin is thin and soft, indicating a deficiency in the essence of blood that permeates through the skin.)</p>
<p>When the energy of the greater yang of the hand is vigorous, there will be abundant facial hair.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: Do women without facial hair lack blood and Qi? Qi Bo replied: The Chong and Ren vessels both originate in the womb, traversing the back interior; they are the sea of meridians. The superficial ones circulate externally, moving upward from the right abdomen, converging at the throat, and branching to connect with the lips. When blood and Qi are abundant, they fill the skin with warmth and flesh; when blood is plentiful alone, it seeps lightly into the skin and promotes hair growth. Now, women have an excess of Qi but insufficient blood due to their frequent blood loss, which means that the Chong and Ren vessels do not nourish the mouth and lips, and thus facial hair does not grow. </p>
<p>(Note: This text discusses the correlation between blood and Qi in relation to the growth of facial hair, particularly in women.)<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;A scholar suffers damage to the yin; when the yin energy is severed and cannot rise, the yin does not function. However, the beard remains; what is the reason for this? The eunuch loses it all; why is that?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Eunuchs lose their fundamental sinew, injure their central vessels, experience blood depletion that does not recover, their skin becomes hardened, and their lips and mouth lack luster, thus the beard does not grow.&quot; </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What about those heavenly eunuchs who have never been injured and do not lose blood; still, their beard does not grow—what is the reason for that?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;It is because there is a deficiency from the heavens; their energy is not abundant, the foundational sinews are not complete, and there is qi without blood, leading to their lips and mouth lacking luster, thus the beard does not grow.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: Beards grow after one has reached maturity, yet they are fundamentally rooted in the primordial essence and the interplay of yin, yang, blood, and qi.] </p>
<p>The beautiful eyebrow represents a surplus of blood from the Taiyang, while a prominent beard signifies a surplus of blood from the Shaoyang, and a fine mustache indicates a surplus of blood from the Yangming. </p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the alignment of humans with the four seasons of heaven, regardless of their limbs.]<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>The Beginning of All Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Piercing evil enters through the skin. It begins at the surface; when the skin is weak, the pores open. When they open, the evil enters through the hair. Once it enters, it reaches deep; and when deep, the hair stands upright. When the hair stands upright, it flutters. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Evil entering a person must first start at the skin and hair. When a person&#39;s form is weak, the skin relaxes, and the pores open. When they open, evil enters through the hair, goes deep, and if deep, the hair stands. The essence (qi) fills the skin and nourishes the hair; when evil damages the qi, it affects the hair&#39;s growth. If the evil enters the skin and does not harm the qi, the hair can stand upright. The fluttering indicates a shaking of the form. </p>
<p><strong>Evil Guests</strong></p>
<p>The earth has grasses and weeds; people have hair and fur.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This discusses the human form in relation to heaven and earth.</p>
<p><strong>The Difficulties of Bian Que</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hair Breaking</strong></p>
<p>The fourteenth difficulty states: the disease of the pulse arises first from the damage to the skin and hair, where the skin gathers, causing hair to fall. When the skin gathers and hair falls, it leads to death. </p>
<p>The twenty-fourth difficulty states: when the hand of the Taiyin energy is exhausted, the skin and hair become scorched. Taiyin refers to the lungs, which govern qi and warmth to the skin and hair. When the qi is not nourishing, the skin and hair become scorched. When they are scorched, body fluids are depleted; with depleted fluids, the skin and joints are harmed. When the skin and joints are harmed, the skin withers and the hair breaks; hair breaking means it dies first. On a vigorous day, it strengthens; on a lethargic day, it dies.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>Hair Loss</h3>
<p>The twenty-four difficulties state: When the qi of the lesser yin at the feet is exhausted, the bones wither. The lesser yin pertains to the winter pulse, which operates quietly and warms the marrow. Thus, if the marrow is not warm, the flesh does not adhere to the bones; when the bones and flesh are not close, the flesh becomes moist and weak. When the flesh becomes moist and weak, the teeth lengthen and wither, and the hair lacks luster. Lack of luster indicates that the bones have first died. On day Wu (戊), it is severe; on day Ji (己), it dies.<br>— <strong>Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)</p>
<h3>Hair Shedding</h3>
<p>If a person loses essence, their hair will fall out; the pulse will be extremely deficient, weak, and slow.  </p>
<h3>Hair Standing</h3>
<p>In the case of solar yang being overheated, the hair feels hot and dislikes the cold. After urination, there is a feeling of hair standing on end.<br>— <strong>Zhong Zang Jing</strong> (Han Dynasty, Hua Tuo)</p>
<h3>Signs of Death</h3>
<p>If the eyebrows are tilted, death occurs in seven days.<br>If the hair of the eyebrows appears bristled, death occurs.<br>If the hair is straight, death occurs in fifteen days.<br>If the hair is like hemp and emotions are unbalanced, death occurs.<br>If there is a separation between the heart and small intestine, death occurs in six days. The separation leads to hair being straight like hemp, incessant sweating, and an inability to bend or stretch.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong> (by Wang Shuhe of the Jin Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Dry Hair</strong></p>
<p>The song for the slow pulse says: All three regions slow, the kidneys cold; skin is dry, hair is parched. The lung pulse song says: Firm and slippery, the major signs combined; hair is scorched, mucus sticky. Additionally, the throat has dryness; in autumn, it&#39;s best to treat. Submerged and fine, still combined slippery, know this is bone steaming. Skin and hair are all dry, cold and heat mutually sustained. The fine pulse song says: Lacking strength and energy, pain in the calves; appearance is haggard, hair is dry. If it encounters winter after frost, if the illness is not treated, it will surely heal itself. The lung song says: Air exits the mouth and nose, not returning; lips are dark, lacking color like coal. Skin is scorched and dry, nails brittle; after three days on the road, disaster will surely be known. The kidney song says: Face dark, teeth painful, eyes like blind; sweating like water, frequent back pain. Skin and flesh are dampened, hair lacks luster; after four days, one should know their fate is in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Straight</strong></p>
<p>The lung pulse song says: Twelve beats in motion yet not coming; coughing, sputum, pus hard to restore. Hair straight as hemp in just a short time; even Bian Que would find it hard to rescue. The observation of color and disease song says: Hair straight as hemp, dead in half a day.</p>

<p><strong>Eyebrow Wind Poison</strong></p>
<p>This poison affects the liver channel, causing stagnation of chi and blood, resulting in toxic accumulation. Use methods to eliminate poison and flow chi, internal remedies to promote flow, and clear liver drink for treatment.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Eyebrow Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Eyebrow ulcers extend from the brow to the head, producing black sores that gradually swell at the waist, causing a full, distended sensation on the face. The sores are as hard as stone, and when pricked with a needle do not produce pus; instead, they leak fluid, causing unbearable pain, and often result in feelings of oppression and nausea. These sores can expel pus within six days. If nausea and oppression gradually decrease, treatment is possible. If they do not decrease, men may succumb in twenty-four days, while women may pass away in seven days. Immediate use of pain-relieving detoxifying powders is essential for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Hair Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from deficiency heat in the spleen and stomach, and the upward assault of external wind in the heart and lungs, often located on the side of the jaw, resembling a goat&#39;s thorn. The edges are swollen and hard, with intolerable pain, often accompanied by oozing yellow fluid, numbness, aversion to cold, and intense heat toxicity that descends into the chest, leading to overall body heat as hidden Yang attacks the heart and lungs, causing deficiency heat to rise to the san jiao (three burners). Internally, a mixture of angelica powder should be taken; externally, gently rub and break the area with Shen Ying powder.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Hair Toxic</strong></p>
<p>This toxicity occurs due to heat in the kidney meridian, with insufficient moisture to nourish the heart fire, resulting in this condition. Urgent consumption of ginseng detox powder, enhanced with Schisandra berries, plus Qianjin&#39;s internal restorative powder, and waxy alum pills taken in doses of fifty to sixty pills over a span of ten days; once the sores soften, use a replacement needle pill to break them open. Do not use needles directly; if a needle is used and yellow fluid appears, fine yellow blisters will develop around the area and spread on the face. Then apply detoxifying powder around the surrounding area, employing the same decoction method as for facial hair toxicity, with treatment applied as needed.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Medical Discourse</strong> (Song Dynasty, Zhang Zichong)</p>
<p><strong>Each Has Its Domain</strong></p>
<p>Hair belongs to the heart, hence it grows upwards, deriving from fire energy. Eyebrows belong to the liver, hence they grow horizontally, deriving from wood energy. Beard belongs to the kidneys, hence it grows downwards, deriving from water energy.</p>
<p><strong>Confucian Filial Piety</strong> (Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng)</p>
<p><strong>Heat in the Blood Causes Hair Loss</strong></p>
<p>When a young person&#39;s hair turns white or falls out, or if there are white flakes, it indicates excess heat in the blood. People commonly believe that hair is merely a surplus of blood; however, blood deficiency causes this, and they do not realize that heat in the blood can hinder hair growth. The liver corresponds to wood; excessive fire and insufficient water will not nourish the wood. When heat reaches the crown, it exacerbates inflammation. After a severe fever or excessive sweat, hair can fall out; this is not caused by cold.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Sores</strong></p>
<p>Sores in children, referred to as &quot;eyebrow sores&quot; on the face, &quot;ear sores&quot; at the ear, and &quot;shoe itch&quot; on the feet, all have misleading names. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: all painful, itchy sores belong to the heart fire. They are caused by the excessive heat of heart fire. One may use a needle (Jinfei) to prick and cause bleeding; if it does not heal after one puncture, repeat the puncture to ensure healing. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: a surplus of blood should be drained. Draining means breaking the blood. Eyebrow sores should not be treated with medicinal applications; if the sores itch excessively, they will be scratched, and if they affect the eyes, damage to the eyes will occur.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Eastearn Garden Ten Books (Yuan, Li Gao)</h3>
<h4>Treatment for Dried and Withered Hair</h4>
<p>Weak pulse and weak Qi, dry skin and hair. Use Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction or Siwu Decoction for treatment. For diseases of deficiencies, if the lung is affected, leading to skin and hair loss, Eight Ingredients Decoction is appropriate.</p>
<h3>Danxi’s Heart Principles (Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng)</h3>
<h4>Pain Around the Eyebrows</h4>
<p>Pain around the eyebrows is associated with wind-heat and phlegm, treated like wind and phlegm pain. There are two conditions for pain: if the eyes are related to the liver, liver deficiency causes pain; when exposed to light, there is severe pain in the orbital bones, use raw and cooked Rehmannia pills. If there is pain near the brow ridge bones, cannot open the eyes, severe pain at night, use Phlegm-Dissolving Decoction or Xiongxin Decoction with bud tea, or swallow Qingzhou white pills with Erchen Decoction, which is effective.</p>
<h3>Medical Entry (Ming, Li Zhen)</h3>
<h4>Hair is the Excess of Blood</h4>
<p>When blood is abundant, hair is moist; when blood decreases, hair declines; when blood is hot, hair turns yellow; when blood deteriorates, hair turns white.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Facial hair and scalp hair are all connected by the governing vessels. When yang essence flows abundantly outward, hair thrives, and the complexion becomes radiant. The gallbladder nourishes the beard, and the kidney nourishes the hair; when vital energy ascends, the hair remains moist and dark. After the ages of six and eight, the essence can no longer ascend; with the arrival of autumn and winter, the metal element affects the lungs, leading to dry, brittle hair resembling ash-white. Those concerned with health should proactively take tonics to nourish essence to prevent this, as dyeing or other superficial measures are not wise solutions.</p>
<p>Dry hair is linked to fiery anger in the gallbladder. The gallbladder connects with the bladder, nourishing the hair, and when wind energy is strong, it becomes damaged; when fluids are depleted, it becomes dry. As one ages, it&#39;s common for hair to fall and beard to lengthen. In youth, hair loss or beard loss suggests depletion of the kidneys, excess fire, or lung weakness, often due to internal wind. Black sesame wine, kidney qi pills, and asparagus decoction can address this. For severe internal wind, use wisteria leaf decoction.</p>
<p>For hair loss and dryness that appears yellowish or white, often due to excessive vomiting or blood loss, the jade ointment can be used. If due to excessive sexual activity leading to premature graying, remedies like the Return to Source Pill, Autumn Stone Pill, or the Nourishing Zhen Pill are beneficial. For those experiencing hair whitening due to excessive heat and blood depletion, remedies like the Great Creation Pill and Eight Immortals Longevity Ointment are suggested. If moisture, phlegm, or other ailments have led to paleness, use astragalus ointment or the enhanced astragalus ointment.</p>
<p>For wind-related skin and muscle pain or itching, use he shou wu pills. Those with yang deficiency should consider herbs like Black Hair Healthy Yang Pills or Longevity Tonic Pills. Hair treatments must consider the underlying conditions; neglecting the organs and solely focusing on hair and beard with arbitrary pills is like opening the abdomen to hide jewels.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles of Old and New</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nourishing Qi and Blood Leads to Beauty and Not Graying</strong></p>
<p>Black and beautiful hair must be nourished by abundant Qi and blood. When Qi and blood are flourishing, the hair is beautiful; when they decline, the hair turns gray. This is an inevitable truth. After a person turns thirty, regularly taking medicine to replenish the kidneys and nourish yin can maintain and enrich Qi and blood, preventing gray hair until old age—this has been verified. If one only takes medicine after decline has set in, how can recovery be achieved? It is easier to address issues before they arise than to try to revert what has already occurred, which is seldom successful.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Pain</strong></p>
<p>Pain in the brow bone often indicates rising liver fire; severe anger can lead to this condition. The so-called wind conditions are also caused by fire, as excessive heat generates wind. Generally, one should suppress liver fire, and if phlegm-wind is present, treat both simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Insights of Old and New</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinct Qi of Internal Organs</strong></p>
<p>Though hair, beard, and eyebrows all belong to the same category, they originate from different internal organs, which is why some become old with white beard and ungray eyebrows, or have gray hair but unchanged eyebrows. This difference arises from the specific Qi of the organs. In men, kidney Qi manifests outwardly as a beard and inwardly as potency. Thus, women and eunuchs lack potency and therefore do not have beards, but their eyebrows and hair are indistinguishable from men’s, indicating that this does not pertain to the kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>Restoration of Vitality from All Illnesses</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Gong Tingxian)</strong><a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>The Meaning of Naming</h3>
<p>At the head is hair, hair is something that is plucked and stands out. At the eyes are the eyebrows, eyebrows are charming and alluring. Below the jaw is the beard, the beard signifies flourishing, as things flourish when they are fully formed, so do humans grow beards. At the cheeks is the whiskers, which sway as the mouth moves, gently and gradually. Above the mouth is the mustache, mustache signifies beauty, contributing to one&#39;s appearance.</p>
<h3>The Meridians’ Nourishment</h3>
<p>The &quot;Chao Clan’s Source of Illness&quot; states: The meridian of the Lesser Yang Gallbladder nourishes the beard. The meridian of the Lesser Yin Kidney flourishes in hair. The Chong and Ren vessels are considered the sea of the twelve meridians, known as the sea of blood, with branches connecting to the upper lip. When the blood is abundant, it nourishes the hair, hence the beauty of the beard and hair. When blood and energy are weak, the meridians become insufficient to nourish and moisten, leading to hair loss.</p>
<h3>Hair and Mustache Toxicity</h3>
<p>The &quot;Ghost’s Legacy&quot; states: There is hair and mustache in the area below the nose and at two points on the philtrum. This often results from plucking the mustache and exposing oneself to the wind, causing an irregular reaction with both cold and heat, which can be harmful. If asked about the sore growing at the corner of the mouth, it is called mustache toxicity, caused by wind-heat from the Yangming Meridian. Use the “Alive Life Decoction” with Scutellaria, Coptis, Radix Platycodon, Gardenia, and Bohe to clear heat; for the robust, take one pill of Golden Elixir. If it is indurated and the muscles feel numb, sometimes tingling or itchy, with intense cold and heat, and symptoms like vexation and nausea, it can be classified as a carbuncle.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Scalp Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: Along the hairline on both sides, it presents like millet, with white scalp and red flesh, feeling hot and painful like being pricked by a needle. This ailment is more common in women and less so in men. It initially arises from wind and dampness attacking the hairline, and it is necessary for it to exude pus without causing harm. If someone asks about ulcers at the hairline, it is referred to as scalp ulcer. It resembles a water caltrop, swollen and affected by cold and heat, accompanied by either pain or itching, which also indicates scalp abscess. This is caused by wind and heat obstructing upwards. It is advisable to take Fangfeng Tongsheng San, Zijindan, or Duoming Dan to induce sweating.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: On both sides of the eyebrow ridge, it does not matter if it is at the front or back of the head; it is advisable to attack before it has fully developed. If it attacks towards the front of the eyebrow, it can affect the eyes and impair vision; if it attacks towards the back, it can involve the temples, and one should be cautious. If someone asks about eyebrow abscess poison, it is stated: Eyebrow abscess starts from the eyebrow extending to the head, with a gradual blackish swelling, covering the entire face with ulcerated spots, hard as stone; when pricked, there is no pus, only yellow fluid that emerges, causing unbearable pain, confusion, and nausea. This is due to the accumulation of heat and wind poison from the internal organs attacking upwards. Urgently take Zijindan, Shengjindan to induce sweating; add Huanglian, Jiegeng, and Shengma to Lifesaving Drink, or use Huanglian Xiaoduo Drink to reduce heat and detoxify. If after six or seven days, it produces yellow-white pus upon pricking, it can be treated. If it is dry and purple, with no pus upon pricking, causing vomiting, agitation, and a confused spirit leading to a refusal to eat, this will result in death.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Furuncle on the Eyebrow Center</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked what to do when a furuncle arises on the eyebrow center. It is called eyebrow center furuncle, also known as facial wind toxin, attributed to the foot Taiyang bladder meridian. It arises from wind-heat accumulation and the stagnation of yin and yang. Quickly take Zijing Dan (Purple Gold Pill) or Chan Su Wan (Toad Venom Pill) to induce sweating; or take a grain of gold pill. If it is black and very painful, or numb or itchy, accompanied by chills and fevers, it is a carbuncle.</p>
<p><em>From &quot;Orthodox Medicine of Surgery&quot; by Chen Shigong, Ming Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>Longquan Carbuncle and Tiger&#39;s Whisker Toxin</strong></p>
<p>These two toxins are related to the kidney and governing vessels, resulting from being suddenly attacked by external pathogens. Longquan carbuncle occurs between the philtrum, while Tiger’s Whisker toxin develops above the diaphragm. Initially, lumps appear, followed by swelling and pain, then chills and fevers; in severe cases, nausea and dry vomiting, with swelling of the cheeks and neck. Cauterization is to be avoided at this point; at the onset, use a fine needle to puncture the top of the affected area, placing a toad venom cake on top and covering it with a plaster to allow the toxin to escape. For swollen areas, apply a dispersing yellow powder. For those with exterior symptoms, use Jingfang Baidu San with additional Scutellaria, Coptis, and Burdock; for internal symptoms, use Huanglian Decoction. If pus has formed, use Xiong Gui Neituo San; if pus causes swelling pain, puncture it to achieve healing; after the pus drains, continue using the plaster for easy healing. This condition often occurs in those with strong vital energy, so medication is generally unnecessary as self-healing is common.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Secret Text of the Stone Chamber</strong> by Chen Shiduo</p>
<p><strong>On Regenerating Eyebrows and Blackening Mustaches</strong></p>
<p>To restore fallen eyebrows, you can use seven pounds of mulberry leaves; wash them daily, and within a month, they will regrow as before. The mustache also falls out similarly. If the mustache turns white, it indicates depleted kidney essence and dry blood in the channels; either condition can lead to white mustaches, and the best remedy is a preparation of Rehmannia. </p>
<p>Currently, if not using that, take half a pound of mulberries, extract the juice to obtain one bowl, add one tael of crushed bones as powder to soak it, then dry in the sun. If there is no sun, use fire to dry it; soak again, using the drying juice as a measure. </p>
<p>Then take two taels each of raw red fleeceflower and dried prepared Rehmannia, one tael each of Qing salt and Angelica, and four pairs of male and female stones of the medicinal herb Ma Bozi—long ones for males, round ones for females—all ground into fine powder. Brush your teeth with this seven times daily, three and a half times on each side, and within a month, they will turn as black as lacquer.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The mulberry fruit is particularly effective at nourishing the yin and darkening the beard. When combined with cooked rehmannia and fo-ti, how could it fail to darken? However, it is too bitter to be absorbed by the roots of the beard. The cleverness of the method lies in using crushed bone and certain stones that penetrate directly into the flesh of the teeth. Once it enters the flesh, can it not reach the roots of the beard? This is why this recipe is skillful and remarkable. Furthermore, if one were to additionally use kidney-supporting herbs for the beard, to open the channels of the governor and the regulator vessels, then the upper and lower energies would support each other, and surely the beard would rejuvenate to the time of youth! There is another recipe to share. The mulberry fruit is steamed, then sun-dried; if not steamed, it will not dry out well, but it should not touch iron utensils. Steaming it in a rice pot is safe; fresh red fo-ti should be sliced, steamed in a rice pot, and dried nine times for best results; the leaves of the southern candle should also be steamed in the rice pot and then sun-dried; if not steamed, they are useless; one pound each of white atractylodes and cooked rehmannia; half a pound of ophiopogon; four ounces of removed-skin Sichuan pepper, ground to a fine powder of two ounces; and one ounce of ginkgo nuts.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>This formula, which is unalterable, is called Chen&#39;s black mustache pill, and those who take it regularly will achieve longevity. In spring and summer, take the earth yellow pill; in autumn and winter, take this pill, which will promote ascension without a trace of gray hair. When mulberries are not in season, mulberry leaves can be substituted, requiring a thousand pounds—though mulberries are superior to the leaves, the leaves are equally effective. There is also another formula involving bird mustache: one pill formula uses two pounds each of cooked rehmannia and Chinese yam, half a pound each of cornelian cherry and black sesame, one pound each of white atractylodes, ophiopogon root, and mulberry leaves, and four ounces each of processed morinda root and ginkgo nut flesh, ground into powder, made into honey pills, taking five ounces each morning and evening; adding six slices of fortune plant enhances the effect.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>A decoction recipe: 熟地 (reheated root), 生赤何首鸟 (raw He Shou Wu), 山药 (Chinese yam), and 桑叶 (mulberry leaves), each one tael; 白果 (ginkgo nuts) two qian; 黑芝麻 (black sesame) five qian, roasted and ground. 半片万年青 (half a piece of Aspidistra), 人参 (ginseng) three qian, 花椒 (Sichuan pepper) one qian. Decoct with water, add one tea cup of wine, then add five fen of 桔梗 (platycodon). Take the first decoction in the morning, the second in the evening, and the third at night; after four doses, it will turn as black as lacquer. Using both formulas will ensure it never turns white again. If one has deficient qi and blood, taking ten doses will surely yield results. </p>
<p>For the black hair formula, it is particularly effective to use dried mulberries steamed in a pot, along with one pound of raw He Shou Wu made into pills. Taking these two ingredients morning and night will naturally make the hair black. This pair is indeed a sacred medicine for black hair; daily consumption can prolong life and reverse aging, not just make the hair dark. One may add a little ginkgo for better effect, but there is no need to add reheated root; increasing the number of ingredients does not enhance the effect proportionately. Use raw He Shou Wu, as it does not leak its essence. The whole skin should be used to draw into one&#39;s hair and skin. Take five qian daily, or one tael. If mulberries are unavailable, use two jin of mulberry leaves and one jin of He Shou Wu instead. </p>

For thinning hair that does not grow, this is also suitable.<br>For dyeing facial hair: use forty centipedes, soak them in ink for three days, bury them in horse dung for a month, then test with a white silk to see if it has dyed; if so, bury again for seven days in horse dung, check again for gentleness, then twist the hair so as to avoid blackening the skin.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>After recovering from an illness: boil the tender branches of wild roses and monkey ginger to make a juice for application.</p>
<p>To make teeth turn from white to black: take the skin of one sour pomegranate, wrap it in clay, and burn it until it turns red; let it cool and remove the clay. Burn eggplant roots along with locust branches until the smoke ceases, then cover immediately and wait for it to cool. Use locust branches from the wall where purslane grows, and harvest them unseen. Grind one tael each of mint, gypsum, and gall nuts until fine, then use this mixture to clean your teeth. Not only will they turn from white to black, but also become stronger—truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Favorable days to turn white hair black: the 4th of the 1st month, 8th of the 2nd month, 13th of the 3rd month, 16th of the 4th month, 20th of the 5th month, 20th of the 6th month, 28th of the 7th month, 19th of the 8th month, 25th of the 9th month, 1st of the 10th month, 11th of the 11th month, and 10th of the 12th month. Rise early on these days to pluck, and it will never go white. Additionally, the 5th and 13th of the 1st month, the 8th and 18th of the 2nd month, the 3rd of the 3rd month, the 13th and 25th of the 4th month, the 5th and 15th of the 5th month, the 14th and 24th of the 6th month, the 18th and 28th of the 7th month, the 9th and 10th of the 8th month, the 8th and 18th of the 9th month, the 13th and 23rd of the 10th month, the 10th of the 11th month, and the 16th of the 12th month. On these dates as well, pluck in the morning hours. When plucking, first grind clove juice on a stone with water; immediately after plucking, quickly apply it to the hair follicles to encourage them to turn black.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>To make the whitening remedy: Take one large sheng jiang (fresh ginger) and scrape off the skin, placing it in a pot. Use gentle heat to simmer, ensuring the pot does not boil over, and it is best if the ginger is very oily. There is no need to wash or scrape further; simply place the ginger skin in the pot, sealing it tightly to prevent air from entering. Have a careful person monitor it. When the color has not begun to separate, you must begin to simmer it without letting the fire get too hot. If the person monitoring feels fatigued, they should switch places with someone else. The mixture will be ready after one hour of simmering and should be placed in a clay bowl and ground finely. Although it says an hour, if the heat is even, it can be ready by sunset. When using, take a small amount on the tip of a fine stick, about the size of a sesame seed, and first apply it to the white hairs, then remove it; afterwards, apply again, using a warm finger to massage it into the skin. By the fourth day, some black hairs should start to appear, demonstrating its remarkable effectiveness.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p>

<p>The &quot;Book of Longevity&quot; states: &quot;Combing the hair often brightens the eyes and wards off wind.&quot; Hence, Daoists comb their hair in the morning, typically a hundred and twenty times.

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>Zhongjing saw the attendant Wang Zhongxuan, who was over twenty years old, and said: &quot;You have a sickness. At forty, your eyebrows will fall, and you will die six months after that.&quot; He instructed him to take the Wushi Decoction to avoid this. Zhongxuan disliked his words and took the decoction but did not consume it. Three days later, Zhongjing asked him: &quot;Did you take the decoction?&quot; Zhongxuan replied: &quot;I have taken it.&quot; Zhongjing said: &quot;The complexion is not indicative of taking the decoction; why do you take your life lightly?&quot; Zhongxuan still did not believe him. Twenty years later, his eyebrows indeed fell out, and one hundred eighty-seven days after that, he died, thus fulfilling Zhongjing&#39;s words.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: &quot;A youth named Hu, aged seventeen or eighteen, lost all his hair without leaving a single strand. His diet and daily routines were normal, his pulse was weak and taut yet equal in strength. I said: &#39;This is due to excessive flavors leading to phlegm-damp in the diaphragm. Additionally, eating too many plums will sour and collect the damp-heat phlegm, which rises to the head, steaming the blood at the hair roots, gradually leading to dryness and eventual hair loss.&#39; I then prescribed blood-tonifying and dispersing herbs, using Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder without the Mangxiao, and only Da Huang stir-fried three times with wine, combined with Siwu Decoction prepared with wine to make a small dose. I frequently administered this with gray decoction in water for over two months. Upon re-evaluation of his pulse, the damp-heat was gradually resolved, and I halted the medicine, adjusting with mild nourishment. Two years later, his hair grew back to its original state and he recovered.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: The Yangming channel follows the hairline, thus when it weakens, hair falls out. Blood vessels flourish in color; when they weaken, hair turns white.</p>
<p>A man’s kidney energy is strong at eight years, causing hair to grow longer and teeth to change. By fifty-eight, kidney energy weakens, hair falls out, and teeth decay.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The kidney is the origin of vitality. When a man lacks energy, his foundational force deteriorates first, leading to hair fall and tooth decay.</p>
<p>By sixty-eight, Yang energy depletes in the upper part of the body, causing hair to turn white at the temples. By eighty-eight, both hair and teeth are lost.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: After a certain age, deterioration is extreme; hence, not only does hair turn white and become brittle but it also falls out.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On the Six Organs and Their Symbols</strong></p>
<p>The lungs are the source of qi and the place of the corporeal soul, with their essence manifesting in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The lungs govern the skin and hair; thus, their essence is found in hair.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern storage and are the foundation of essence, with their essence manifesting in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Hair is the excess of blood; blood is transformed from essence, hence the essence is found in hair.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The lungs combine with the skin; their essence is in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Hair is attached to skin; when qi is abundant, hair flourishes. The kidneys combine with bones; their essence is in hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The kidneys store essence and govern the marrow, hence their connection is to bones. Hair is the excess of essence and blood; thus, its essence is in hair.</p>
<p>Eating too much bitterness causes the skin to wither and hair to fall out.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Bitterness is a flavor of fire; excessive intake harms the lungs, leading to withered skin and falling hair.</p>
<p>Eating too much sweetness results in bone pain and hair loss.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Sweetness is a taste of earth, and excessive sweetness harms the kidneys, causing bone pain and hair loss.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Weakness:</strong><br>The lungs govern the skin and hair of the whole body; therefore, when lung heat is intense, the skin and hair become weak and thin. Lung heat manifests as a pale complexion and damaged hair.</p>
<p><strong>Needling Explanation:</strong><br>Human hair, teeth, ears, and eyes correspond to the five sounds, aligning with the five tones and six rhythms.

<p>When the qi of the Hand Taiyin is depleted, the skin and hair become scorched. The Taiyin is responsible for circulating qi and warming the skin and hair; hence, when the qi is not nourishing, the skin and hair scorch. When the skin and hair scorch, the fluids are lost from the skin and joints; when the fluids are lost from the skin and joints, the nails wither, and the hair breaks. When the hair breaks, it is the hair that dies first. The fire dominates the metal as both Bingtian and Dingtian perish.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The qi of the Hand Taiyin governs the skin and hair; thus, when the qi of the Taiyin is depleted, the skin and hair scorch. The Hand Taiyin governs qi, which influences and moistens the skin and fur; thus, the Taiyin is responsible for circulating qi and warming the skin and hair. Therefore, when the qi is not nourishing, the skin and hair scorch. The fluids are released through the Sanjiao to warm the muscles, moisten the bones and joints, and hydrate the skin. When the qi does not nourish, the fluids are lost from the skin and joints, leading to withered nails and broken hair. The hair dying first indicates the depletion of the qi of the Hand Taiyin externally. Bingtian and Dingtian dying signify the death of the lung&#39;s qi internally.</p>
<p>When the qi of the Foot Shaoyin is depleted, the pulse becomes obstructed; when the pulse is obstructed, the blood does not flow; when the blood does not flow, the color of the hair lacks luster.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Blood flows along with the pulse qi, and hair is produced from blood qi; thus, if the blood and pulse do not flow, the hair color lacks luster.</p>
<p>When the qi of the Foot Shaoyin is depleted, the bones dry out, and the hair loses its luster. When the hair loses its luster, the bones die first.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The kidneys store essence and transform it into blood; hair is a surplus of blood. When the hair loses its luster, the essence and qi of the kidneys are depleted, leading to the death of the bones first.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

Thus, when the blood and qi of the skin are abundant, the eyebrows look beautiful and are adorned with fine hair.

<p>Above the foot of the Yangming, when blood and qi are abundant, the beard is beautiful and long; when blood is scarce but qi is plentiful, the beard is short; when qi is scarce and blood is abundant, the beard is sparse; when both blood and qi are insufficient, there is no beard, and the lips are heavily marked.

When blood and Qi are abundant, they fill the skin with warmth and flesh; when blood is plentiful alone, it seeps lightly into the skin and promotes hair growth.

<p>The twenty-four difficulties state: When the qi of the lesser yin at the feet is exhausted, the bones wither.

The fine pulse song says: Lacking strength and energy, pain in the calves; appearance is haggard, hair is dry. If it encounters winter after frost, if the illness is not treated, it will surely heal itself. The lung song says: Air exits the mouth and nose, not returning; lips are dark, lacking color like coal. Skin is scorched and dry, nails brittle; after three days on the road, disaster will surely be known.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Eyebrow Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Eyebrow ulcers extend from the brow to the head, producing black sores that gradually swell at the waist, causing a full, distended sensation on the face. The sores are as hard as stone, and when pricked with a needle do not produce pus; instead, they leak fluid, causing unbearable pain, and often result in feelings of oppression and nausea. These sores can expel pus within six days. If nausea and oppression gradually decrease, treatment is possible. If they do not decrease, men may succumb in twenty-four days, while women may pass away in seven days. Immediate use of pain-relieving detoxifying powders is essential for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Hair Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from deficiency heat in the spleen and stomach, and the upward assault of external wind in the heart and lungs, often located on the side of the jaw, resembling a goat&#39;s thorn. The edges are swollen and hard, with intolerable pain, often accompanied by oozing yellow fluid, numbness, aversion to cold, and intense heat toxicity that descends into the chest, leading to overall body heat as hidden Yang attacks the heart and lungs, causing deficiency heat to rise to the san jiao (three burners). Internally, a mixture of angelica powder should be taken; externally, gently rub and break the area with Shen Ying powder.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Hair Toxic</strong></p>
<p>This toxicity occurs due to heat in the kidney meridian, with insufficient moisture to nourish the heart fire, resulting in this condition. Urgent consumption of ginseng detox powder, enhanced with Schisandra berries, plus Qianjin&#39;s internal restorative powder, and waxy alum pills taken in doses of fifty to sixty pills over a span of ten days; once the sores soften, use a replacement needle pill to break them open. Do not use needles directly; if a needle is used and yellow fluid appears, fine yellow blisters will develop around the area and spread on the face. Then apply detoxifying powder around the surrounding area, employing the same decoction method as for facial hair toxicity, with treatment applied as needed.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Discourse</strong> (Song Dynasty, Zhang Zichong)</p>
<p><strong>Each Has Its Domain</strong></p>
<p>Hair belongs to the heart, hence it grows upwards, deriving from fire energy. Eyebrows belong to the liver, hence they grow horizontally, deriving from wood energy. Beard belongs to the kidneys, hence it grows downwards, deriving from water energy.</p>
<p><strong>Confucian Filial Piety</strong> (Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng)</p>
<p><strong>Heat in the Blood Causes Hair Loss</strong></p>
<p>When a young person&#39;s hair turns white or falls out, or if there are white flakes, it indicates excess heat in the blood. People commonly believe that hair is merely a surplus of blood; however, blood deficiency causes this, and they do not realize that heat in the blood can hinder hair growth. The liver corresponds to wood; excessive fire and insufficient water will not nourish the wood. When heat reaches the crown, it exacerbates inflammation. After a severe fever or excessive sweat, hair can fall out; this is not caused by cold.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Sores</strong></p>
<p>Sores in children, referred to as &quot;eyebrow sores&quot; on the face, &quot;ear sores&quot; at the ear, and &quot;shoe itch&quot; on the feet, all have misleading names. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: all painful, itchy sores belong to the heart fire. They are caused by the excessive heat of heart fire. One may use a needle (Jinfei) to prick and cause bleeding; if it does not heal after one puncture, repeat the puncture to ensure healing. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: a surplus of blood should be drained. Draining means breaking the blood. Eyebrow sores should not be treated with medicinal applications; if the sores itch excessively, they will be scratched, and if they affect the eyes, damage to the eyes will occur.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Facial hair and scalp hair are all connected by the governing vessels. When yang essence flows abundantly outward, hair thrives, and the complexion becomes radiant. The gallbladder nourishes the beard, and the kidney nourishes the hair; when vital energy ascends, the hair remains moist and dark. After the ages of six and eight, the essence can no longer ascend; with the arrival of autumn and winter, the metal element affects the lungs, leading to dry, brittle hair resembling ash-white. Those concerned with health should proactively take tonics to nourish essence to prevent this, as dyeing or other superficial measures are not wise solutions.</p>
<p>Dry hair is linked to fiery anger in the gallbladder. The gallbladder connects with the bladder, nourishing the hair, and when wind energy is strong, it becomes damaged; when fluids are depleted, it becomes dry. As one ages, it&#39;s common for hair to fall and beard to lengthen. In youth, hair loss or beard loss suggests depletion of the kidneys, excess fire, or lung weakness, often due to internal wind. Black sesame wine, kidney qi pills, and asparagus decoction can address this. For severe internal wind, use wisteria leaf decoction.</p>
<p>For hair loss and dryness that appears yellowish or white, often due to excessive vomiting or blood loss, the jade ointment can be used. If due to excessive sexual activity leading to premature graying, remedies like the Return to Source Pill, Autumn Stone Pill, or the Nourishing Zhen Pill are beneficial. For those experiencing hair whitening due to excessive heat and blood depletion, remedies like the Great Creation Pill and Eight Immortals Longevity Ointment are suggested. If moisture, phlegm, or other ailments have led to paleness, use astragalus ointment or the enhanced astragalus ointment.</p>
<p>For wind-related skin and muscle pain or itching, use he shou wu pills. Those with yang deficiency should consider herbs like Black Hair Healthy Yang Pills or Longevity Tonic Pills. Hair treatments must consider the underlying conditions; neglecting the organs and solely focusing on hair and beard with arbitrary pills is like opening the abdomen to hide jewels.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Principles of Old and New</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nourishing Qi and Blood Leads to Beauty and Not Graying</strong></p>
<p>Black and beautiful hair must be nourished by abundant Qi and blood. When Qi and blood are flourishing, the hair is beautiful; when they decline, the hair turns gray. This is an inevitable truth. After a person turns thirty, regularly taking medicine to replenish the kidneys and nourish yin can maintain and enrich Qi and blood, preventing gray hair until old age—this has been verified. If one only takes medicine after decline has set in, how can recovery be achieved? It is easier to address issues before they arise than to try to revert what has already occurred, which is seldom successful.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Pain</strong></p>
<p>Pain in the brow bone often indicates rising liver fire; severe anger can lead to this condition. The so-called wind conditions are also caused by fire, as excessive heat generates wind. Generally, one should suppress liver fire, and if phlegm-wind is present, treat both simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Insights of Old and New</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinct Qi of Internal Organs</strong></p>
<p>Though hair, beard, and eyebrows all belong to the same category, they originate from different internal organs, which is why some become old with white beard and ungray eyebrows, or have gray hair but unchanged eyebrows. This difference arises from the specific Qi of the organs. In men, kidney Qi manifests outwardly as a beard and inwardly as potency. Thus, women and eunuchs lack potency and therefore do not have beards, but their eyebrows and hair are indistinguishable from men’s, indicating that this does not pertain to the kidneys.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Meaning of Naming</h3>
<p>At the head is hair, hair is something that is plucked and stands out. At the eyes are the eyebrows, eyebrows are charming and alluring. Below the jaw is the beard, the beard signifies flourishing, as things flourish when they are fully formed, so do humans grow beards. At the cheeks is the whiskers, which sway as the mouth moves, gently and gradually. Above the mouth is the mustache, mustache signifies beauty, contributing to one&#39;s appearance.</p>
<h3>The Meridians’ Nourishment</h3>
<p>The &quot;Chao Clan’s Source of Illness&quot; states: The meridian of the Lesser Yang Gallbladder nourishes the beard. The meridian of the Lesser Yin Kidney flourishes in hair. The Chong and Ren vessels are considered the sea of the twelve meridians, known as the sea of blood, with branches connecting to the upper lip. When the blood is abundant, it nourishes the hair, hence the beauty of the beard and hair. When blood and energy are weak, the meridians become insufficient to nourish and moisten, leading to hair loss.</p>
<h3>Hair and Mustache Toxicity</h3>
<p>The &quot;Ghost’s Legacy&quot; states: There is hair and mustache in the area below the nose and at two points on the philtrum. This often results from plucking the mustache and exposing oneself to the wind, causing an irregular reaction with both cold and heat, which can be harmful. If asked about the sore growing at the corner of the mouth, it is called mustache toxicity, caused by wind-heat from the Yangming Meridian. Use the “Alive Life Decoction” with Scutellaria, Coptis, Radix Platycodon, Gardenia, and Bohe to clear heat; for the robust, take one pill of Golden Elixir. If it is indurated and the muscles feel numb, sometimes tingling or itchy, with intense cold and heat, and symptoms like vexation and nausea, it can be classified as a carbuncle.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: Along the hairline on both sides, it presents like millet, with white scalp and red flesh, feeling hot and painful like being pricked by a needle. This ailment is more common in women and less so in men. It initially arises from wind and dampness attacking the hairline, and it is necessary for it to exude pus without causing harm. If someone asks about ulcers at the hairline, it is referred to as scalp ulcer. It resembles a water caltrop, swollen and affected by cold and heat, accompanied by either pain or itching, which also indicates scalp abscess. This is caused by wind and heat obstructing upwards. It is advisable to take Fangfeng Tongsheng San, Zijindan, or Duoming Dan to induce sweating.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: On both sides of the eyebrow ridge, it does not matter if it is at the front or back of the head; it is advisable to attack before it has fully developed. If it attacks towards the front of the eyebrow, it can affect the eyes and impair vision; if it attacks towards the back, it can involve the temples, and one should be cautious. If someone asks about eyebrow abscess poison, it is stated: Eyebrow abscess starts from the eyebrow extending to the head, with a gradual blackish swelling, covering the entire face with ulcerated spots, hard as stone; when pricked, there is no pus, only yellow fluid that emerges, causing unbearable pain, confusion, and nausea. This is due to the accumulation of heat and wind poison from the internal organs attacking upwards. Urgently take Zijindan, Shengjindan to induce sweating; add Huanglian, Jiegeng, and Shengma to Lifesaving Drink, or use Huanglian Xiaoduo Drink to reduce heat and detoxify. If after six or seven days, it produces yellow-white pus upon pricking, it can be treated. If it is dry and purple, with no pus upon pricking, causing vomiting, agitation, and a confused spirit leading to a refusal to eat, this will result in death.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<p>Someone asked what to do when a furuncle arises on the eyebrow center. It is called eyebrow center furuncle, also known as facial wind toxin, attributed to the foot Taiyang bladder meridian. It arises from wind-heat accumulation and the stagnation of yin and yang. Quickly take Zijing Dan (Purple Gold Pill) or Chan Su Wan (Toad Venom Pill) to induce sweating; or take a grain of gold pill. If it is black and very painful, or numb or itchy, accompanied by chills and fevers, it is a carbuncle.</p>

<p><strong>Longquan Carbuncle and Tiger&#39;s Whisker Toxin</strong></p>
<p>These two toxins are related to the kidney and governing vessels, resulting from being suddenly attacked by external pathogens. Longquan carbuncle occurs between the philtrum, while Tiger’s Whisker toxin develops above the diaphragm. Initially, lumps appear, followed by swelling and pain, then chills and fevers; in severe cases, nausea and dry vomiting, with swelling of the cheeks and neck. Cauterization is to be avoided at this point; at the onset, use a fine needle to puncture the top of the affected area, placing a toad venom cake on top and covering it with a plaster to allow the toxin to escape. For swollen areas, apply a dispersing yellow powder. For those with exterior symptoms, use Jingfang Baidu San with additional Scutellaria, Coptis, and Burdock; for internal symptoms, use Huanglian Decoction. If pus has formed, use Xiong Gui Neituo San; if pus causes swelling pain, puncture it to achieve healing; after the pus drains, continue using the plaster for easy healing. This condition often occurs in those with strong vital energy, so medication is generally unnecessary as self-healing is common.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p>To restore fallen eyebrows, you can use seven pounds of mulberry leaves; wash them daily, and within a month, they will regrow as before. The mustache also falls out similarly. If the mustache turns white, it indicates depleted kidney essence and dry blood in the channels; either condition can lead to white mustaches, and the best remedy is a preparation of Rehmannia. </p>
<p>Currently, if not using that, take half a pound of mulberries, extract the juice to obtain one bowl, add one tael of crushed bones as powder to soak it, then dry in the sun. If there is no sun, use fire to dry it; soak again, using the drying juice as a measure. </p>
<p>Then take two taels each of raw red fleeceflower and dried prepared Rehmannia, one tael each of Qing salt and Angelica, and four pairs of male and female stones of the medicinal herb Ma Bozi—long ones for males, round ones for females—all ground into fine powder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The mulberry fruit is particularly effective at nourishing the yin and darkening the beard. When combined with cooked rehmannia and fo-ti, how could it fail to darken? However, it is too bitter to be absorbed by the roots of the beard. The cleverness of the method lies in using crushed bone and certain stones that penetrate directly into the flesh of the teeth. Once it enters the flesh, can it not reach the roots of the beard? This is why this recipe is skillful and remarkable. Furthermore, if one were to additionally use kidney-supporting herbs for the beard, to open the channels of the governor and the regulator vessels, then the upper and lower energies would support each other, and surely the beard would rejuvenate to the time of youth! There is another recipe to share. The mulberry fruit is steamed, then sun-dried; if not steamed, it will not dry out well, but it should not touch iron utensils. Steaming it in a rice pot is safe; fresh red fo-ti should be sliced, steamed in a rice pot, and dried nine times for best results; the leaves of the southern candle should also be steamed in the rice pot and then sun-dried; if not steamed, they are useless; one pound each of white atractylodes and cooked rehmannia; half a pound of ophiopogon; four ounces of removed-skin Sichuan pepper, ground to a fine powder of two ounces; and one ounce of ginkgo nuts.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

When mulberries are not in season, mulberry leaves can be substituted, requiring a thousand pounds—though mulberries are superior to the leaves, the leaves are equally effective. There is also another formula involving bird mustache: one pill formula uses two pounds each of cooked rehmannia and Chinese yam, half a pound each of cornelian cherry and black sesame, one pound each of white atractylodes, ophiopogon root, and mulberry leaves, and four ounces each of processed morinda root and ginkgo nut flesh, ground into powder, made into honey pills, taking five ounces each morning and evening; adding six slices of fortune plant enhances the effect.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A decoction recipe: 熟地 (reheated root), 生赤何首鸟 (raw He Shou Wu), 山药 (Chinese yam), and 桑叶 (mulberry leaves), each one tael; 白果 (ginkgo nuts) two qian; 黑芝麻 (black sesame) five qian, roasted and ground. 半片万年青 (half a piece of Aspidistra), 人参 (ginseng) three qian, 花椒 (Sichuan pepper) one qian. Decoct with water, add one tea cup of wine, then add five fen of 桔梗 (platycodon). Take the first decoction in the morning, the second in the evening, and the third at night; after four doses, it will turn as black as lacquer. Using both formulas will ensure it never turns white again. If one has deficient qi and blood, taking ten doses will surely yield results. </p>
<p>For the black hair formula, it is particularly effective to use dried mulberries steamed in a pot, along with one pound of raw He Shou Wu made into pills. Taking these two ingredients morning and night will naturally make the hair black. This pair is indeed a sacred medicine for black hair; daily consumption can prolong life and reverse aging, not just make the hair dark. One may add a little ginkgo for better effect, but there is no need to add reheated root; increasing the number of ingredients does not enhance the effect proportionately. Use raw He Shou Wu, as it does not leak its essence. The whole skin should be used to draw into one&#39;s hair and skin. Take five qian daily, or one tael. If mulberries are unavailable, use two jin of mulberry leaves and one jin of He Shou Wu instead. </p>
<p>The formula by Zhang Tianshi: for treating the upper Shaoyin and lower Jueyin. Ingredients: 地骨皮 (earth bone skin), 生地 (fresh rehmannia), 菟丝子 (dodder seed) soaked in wine for three days and roasted until yellow; 牛膝 (Chinese achyranthes), 遠志 (Polygala), stones of 菖蒲 (sweet flag) in equal parts.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Seven Treasures Beautiful Beard Pill supplements kidney essence, promotes hair growth, and prolongs life. </p>
<p>He Shou Wu: one pound each of red and white varieties; Chuan Niu Xi: eight ounces. </p>
<p>First, soak He Shou Wu in rice wash water for a day and night, scrape off the coarse skin with a bamboo knife, and cut into large pieces. Lay a layer of black beans in a steamer, then a layer of He Shou Wu, another layer of black beans, a layer of Chuan Niu Xi, another layer of black beans, and so on, alternating layers. Cover with black beans on top, and steam until the beans are done; remove the beans and dry them out. The next day, repeat the process using raw beans to steam again; steam and sun dry a total of seven times. </p>
<p>Once done, remove the beans and add: clean waste paper washed with water, pan-fried with black sesame seeds until silent, then remove the sesame. </p>
<p>White Poria should be mixed with human milk and soaked well, dried, steamed, then dried again. Red Poria should be mixed with black cow milk and treated the same way. </p>
<p>Cuscuta seeds should be soaked in wine overnight, cleaned of dirt, dried, then steamed three times and dried three times. </p>
<p>Angelica root should be cleaned, removing the head and tail, and washed with wine. </p>
<p>Goji berries: half a pound. </p>
<p>Grind the above ingredients, form into pills the size of longan, and chew two or three pills daily on an empty stomach, taking them with warm wine, or rice soup, or white soup, or salty soup—all are fine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The original essence pill is of black color from the northern regions, entering and connecting to the kidneys, opening the orifices of the two lower yin, storing essence in the kidneys. Its taste is salty, resembling water, and its affliction lies in the bones; this medicine primarily addresses that. </p>
<p>For one&#39;s own hair, or hair from parents, whether from young men or women, select and discard the yellow and white parts. First, wash with ash water two or three times; then take four taels of large soapwort, crush it, and boil it in water. Clean it, ensuring there&#39;s no oily residue, which is preferable. Tear the hair into small pieces and dry in the sun; for every pound of clean hair, use four taels of Sichuan pepper, discarding stems and seeds. Alternate layers of hair and pepper in a large pot, mixing thoroughly, then cover with a medium pot lid sealed with salt mud to prevent air leaks. Use slow heat from mulberry wood, and burn three incense sticks to reduce heat, then let cool and take out, weighing about four taels or slightly more. Grind in a windless place into a fine powder.</p>
<p>For He Shou Wu, use nine steams and nine sun-dryings with black beans, selecting and discarding the beans, taking a clean powder of one pound. Black sesame seeds undergo the same nine steams and nine sun-dryings, taking the clean powder. Infuse He Shou Wu in Huaiqing Shengdi wine and pound into a paste. Dry land lotus grass takes its clean juice and reduces it to a paste. For hawthorn seeds, place inside cow bile for a hundred days, four taels of each. Walnut meat is ground into a paste, as well as jujube meat, both at two taels each.</p>
<p>To the right, mix the medicinal powders with all the pastes and add one pound of refined honey. Form into pills about the size of a tung seed; take sixty pills on an empty stomach. Use He Shou Wu wine to chase them down, consuming two or three cups warmed each time, three times a day.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To make the whitening remedy: Take one large sheng jiang (fresh ginger) and scrape off the skin, placing it in a pot. Use gentle heat to simmer, ensuring the pot does not boil over, and it is best if the ginger is very oily. There is no need to wash or scrape further; simply place the ginger skin in the pot, sealing it tightly to prevent air from entering. Have a careful person monitor it. When the color has not begun to separate, you must begin to simmer it without letting the fire get too hot. If the person monitoring feels fatigued, they should switch places with someone else. The mixture will be ready after one hour of simmering and should be placed in a clay bowl and ground finely. Although it says an hour, if the heat is even, it can be ready by sunset. When using, take a small amount on the tip of a fine stick, about the size of a sesame seed, and first apply it to the white hairs, then remove it; afterwards, apply again, using a warm finger to massage it into the skin.

One pound of Nanjing grass, harvested after June, should be selected for its tender and clean leaves, without any dirt. No washing is required; remove the yellow leaves and crush the remainder.

Additionally, take one pound of fresh ginger, extract its juice, and combine it with one pound of white honey, boiling this mixture again at noon. Stir continuously with a willow stick until it reaches the consistency of a thin syrup; the medicine will then be complete. Each month, consume a spoonful in the morning and another in the afternoon, dissolving it in one cup of warm wine. If you wish to form pills, boil it again at noon until suitable for shaping, each pill should be the size of a Paulownia seed, and take thirty pills each time. It is better to take them in larger quantities as their effect is very swift.</p>

Combine all in a kettle and boil down until dry. Cover with an iron lid, seal with salt clay, and calcine it red. Grind to a powder and use three times daily. After finishing, drink ginger tea, starting from the eyebrows, for one month until it turns all black.</p>
<p><strong>Mustache Dyeing Method</strong>: One large turtle, starved for a day or two, fed with rice and bones cooked over fire for three to five months. At night, place it in a lacquered box and put a bamboo piece over the mouth to allow for ventilation, with a lamp outside. The box will get hot, causing the turtle to urinate; if urgent, use sesame oil smoke to stimulate its nose, which will also result in urination. First, stir fivefold galls with vinegar until it becomes like glue; if you obtain a small jar of urine, add half a jar of fivefold vinegar, and boil briefly in a ceramic pot until it stops. Store it in a cow horn container, and use a fresh brush to lightly dip and apply to the mustache, preferably using black powder.</p>
<p><strong>Black Mustache Rolling Method</strong>: Use twenty to thirty large horse flies, place them in a bamboo tube, and leave it exposed to dew at night for fresh air. Starve them for seven days, then grind chicken comb blood with ink and add food four to five times more. Dry them again in the dark, break pig tibia bones, place the flies inside, and tightly bundle with iron wire, coating with salt clay. When dry, place over fire and calcine, repeating for five inch incense twice; withdraw three inches of fire, then five inch incense three times; again, pull away further, using five inch incense once more. Take out the powder, wrap it in pig bile skin, and apply to the mustache; it immediately rolls up.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Black Hair with Dark Beards: Take sixteen pounds of water lily, harvested in the latter half of June and the first half of July. Do not wash it with water. Twist it dry to extract its juice, and sun-dry it for five days without stopping stirring. At noon, add one pound of fresh ginger juice and one pound of honey, mixing as before, and sun-dry while stirring for several days until it resembles syrupy paste. Store it in a clay jar. Take a spoonful of this medicine with one cup of good liquor on an empty stomach daily; take another dose in the afternoon. After twenty-one days, remove the white portions, leaving the black. This is known as water lily paste. [From “Medical Reference”]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Formula for Dark Hair: Take two large leeches, place them in a clay bowl, and starve them for seven days. Take the blood of a black-boned rooster, mix it with dense soot from pine smoke, and pour into a pig&#39;s bladder, allowing the leeches to suck until they are full. Prick the leeches to draw out their juice, applying it, leaving two centimeters of hair roots. Let the juice seep into the flesh; the hair will become lush, black, and soft within a year, remarkably effective. Another formula: Use seven leeches ground into powder, one ounce of mercury, and three ounces of silver, placed in a small box packed with earth from an earthworm’s habitat, about half a finger thick, buried in horse manure for forty-nine days. After removal, it transforms into black oil. Use a fish bladder to dip a little oil and apply it to the hair; the oil will naturally flow down to the roots, turning them black.

<p>The &quot;Book of Longevity&quot; states: &quot;Combing the hair often brightens the eyes and wards off wind.&quot; Hence, Daoists comb their hair in the morning, typically a hundred and twenty times. The &quot;Compendium&quot; states: &quot;Hair is the surplus of blood; combing once a day.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>Zhongjing saw the attendant Wang Zhongxuan, who was over twenty years old, and said: &quot;You have a sickness. At forty, your eyebrows will fall, and you will die six months after that.&quot; He instructed him to take the Wushi Decoction to avoid this. Zhongxuan disliked his words and took the decoction but did not consume it. Three days later, Zhongjing asked him: &quot;Did you take the decoction?&quot; Zhongxuan replied: &quot;I have taken it.&quot; Zhongjing said: &quot;The complexion is not indicative of taking the decoction; why do you take your life lightly?&quot; Zhongxuan still did not believe him. Twenty years later, his eyebrows indeed fell out, and one hundred eighty-seven days after that, he died, thus fulfilling Zhongjing&#39;s words.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: &quot;A youth named Hu, aged seventeen or eighteen, lost all his hair without leaving a single strand. His diet and daily routines were normal, his pulse was weak and taut yet equal in strength. I said: &#39;This is due to excessive flavors leading to phlegm-damp in the diaphragm. Additionally, eating too many plums will sour and collect the damp-heat phlegm, which rises to the head, steaming the blood at the hair roots, gradually leading to dryness and eventual hair loss.&#39; I then prescribed blood-tonifying and dispersing herbs, using Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder without the Mangxiao, and only Da Huang stir-fried three times with wine, combined with Siwu Decoction prepared with wine to make a small dose. I frequently administered this with gray decoction in water for over two months. Upon re-evaluation of his pulse, the damp-heat was gradually resolved, and I halted the medicine, adjusting with mild nourishment. Two years later, his hair grew back to its original state and he recovered.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

Black sesame wine, kidney qi pills, and asparagus decoction can address this. For severe internal wind, use wisteria leaf decoction. For hair loss and dryness that appears yellowish or white, often due to excessive vomiting or blood loss, the jade ointment can be used. If due to excessive sexual activity leading to premature graying, remedies like the Return to Source Pill, Autumn Stone Pill, or the Nourishing Zhen Pill are beneficial. For those experiencing hair whitening due to excessive heat and blood depletion, remedies like the Great Creation Pill and Eight Immortals Longevity Ointment are suggested. If moisture, phlegm, or other ailments have led to paleness, use astragalus ointment or the enhanced astragalus ointment. For wind-related skin and muscle pain or itching, use he shou wu pills. Those with yang deficiency should consider herbs like Black Hair Healthy Yang Pills or Longevity Tonic Pills. Hair treatments must consider the underlying conditions; neglecting the organs and solely focusing on hair and beard with arbitrary pills is like opening the abdomen to hide jewels."},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"**Medical Principles of Old and New** **(Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu)** **Nourishing Qi and Blood Leads to Beauty and Not Graying** Black and beautiful hair must be nourished by abundant Qi and blood. When Qi and blood are flourishing, the hair is beautiful; when they decline, the hair turns gray. This is an inevitable truth. After a person turns thirty, regularly taking medicine to replenish the kidneys and nourish yin can maintain and enrich Qi and blood, preventing gray hair until old age—this has been verified. If one only takes medicine after decline has set in, how can recovery be achieved? It is easier to address issues before they arise than to try to revert what has already occurred, which is seldom successful. **Eyebrow Pain** Pain in the brow bone often indicates rising liver fire; severe anger can lead to this condition. The so-called wind conditions are also caused by fire, as excessive heat generates wind. Generally, one should suppress liver fire, and if phlegm-wind is present, treat both simultaneously. **Medical Insights of Old and New** **(Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin)** **Distinct Qi of Internal Organs** Though hair, beard, and eyebrows all belong to the same category, they originate from different internal organs, which is why some become old with white beard and ungray eyebrows, or have gray hair but unchanged eyebrows. This difference arises from the specific Qi of the organs. In men, kidney Qi manifests outwardly as a beard and inwardly as potency. Thus, women and eunuchs lack potency and therefore do not have beards, but their eyebrows and hair are indistinguishable from men’s, indicating that this does not pertain to the kidneys. **Restoration of Vitality from All Illnesses** **(Ming Dynasty, Gong Tingxian)**"},{"anchor":"trans-19p","marker":"19p","type":"translation","text":"### The Meaning of Naming At the head is hair, hair is something that is plucked and stands out. At the eyes are the eyebrows, eyebrows are charming and alluring. Below the jaw is the beard, the beard signifies flourishing, as things flourish when they are fully formed, so do humans grow beards. At the cheeks is the whiskers, which sway as the mouth moves, gently and gradually. Above the mouth is the mustache, mustache signifies beauty, contributing to one's appearance. ### The Meridians’ Nourishment The \"Chao Clan’s Source of Illness\" states: The meridian of the Lesser Yang Gallbladder nourishes the beard. The meridian of the Lesser Yin Kidney flourishes in hair. The Chong and Ren vessels are considered the sea of the twelve meridians, known as the sea of blood, with branches connecting to the upper lip. When the blood is abundant, it nourishes the hair, hence the beauty of the beard and hair. When blood and energy are weak, the meridians become insufficient to nourish and moisten, leading to hair loss. ### Hair and Mustache Toxicity The \"Ghost’s Legacy\" states: There is hair and mustache in the area below the nose and at two points on the philtrum. This often results from plucking the mustache and exposing oneself to the wind, causing an irregular reaction with both cold and heat, which can be harmful. If asked about the sore growing at the corner of the mouth, it is called mustache toxicity, caused by wind-heat from the Yangming Meridian. Use the “Alive Life Decoction” with Scutellaria, Coptis, Radix Platycodon, Gardenia, and Bohe to clear heat; for the robust, take one pill of Golden Elixir. If it is indurated and the muscles feel numb, sometimes tingling or itchy, with intense cold and heat, and symptoms like vexation and nausea, it can be classified as a carbuncle."},{"anchor":"trans-20p","marker":"20p","type":"translation","text":"**Scalp Ulcer** The text from \"Gui Yi\" states: Along the hairline on both sides, it presents like millet, with white scalp and red flesh, feeling hot and painful like being pricked by a needle. This ailment is more common in women and less so in men. It initially arises from wind and dampness attacking the hairline, and it is necessary for it to exude pus without causing harm. If someone asks about ulcers at the hairline, it is referred to as scalp ulcer. It resembles a water caltrop, swollen and affected by cold and heat, accompanied by either pain or itching, which also indicates scalp abscess. This is caused by wind and heat obstructing upwards. It is advisable to take Fangfeng Tongsheng San, Zijindan, or Duoming Dan to induce sweating. **Eyebrow Ulcer** The text from \"Gui Yi\" states: On both sides of the eyebrow ridge, it does not matter if it is at the front or back of the head; it is advisable to attack before it has fully developed. If it attacks towards the front of the eyebrow, it can affect the eyes and impair vision; if it attacks towards the back, it can involve the temples, and one should be cautious. If someone asks about eyebrow abscess poison, it is stated: Eyebrow abscess starts from the eyebrow extending to the head, with a gradual blackish swelling, covering the entire face with ulcerated spots, hard as stone; when pricked, there is no pus, only yellow fluid that emerges, causing unbearable pain, confusion, and nausea. This is due to the accumulation of heat and wind poison from the internal organs attacking upwards. Urgently take Zijindan, Shengjindan to induce sweating; add Huanglian, Jiegeng, and Shengma to Lifesaving Drink, or use Huanglian Xiaoduo Drink to reduce heat and detoxify. If after six or seven days, it produces yellow-white pus upon pricking, it can be treated.

It is called eyebrow center furuncle, also known as facial wind toxin, attributed to the foot Taiyang bladder meridian. It arises from wind-heat accumulation and the stagnation of yin and yang. Quickly take Zijing Dan (Purple Gold Pill) or Chan Su Wan (Toad Venom Pill) to induce sweating; or take a grain of gold pill. If it is black and very painful, or numb or itchy, accompanied by chills and fevers, it is a carbuncle. *From \"Orthodox Medicine of Surgery\" by Chen Shigong, Ming Dynasty* **Longquan Carbuncle and Tiger's Whisker Toxin** These two toxins are related to the kidney and governing vessels, resulting from being suddenly attacked by external pathogens. Longquan carbuncle occurs between the philtrum, while Tiger’s Whisker toxin develops above the diaphragm. Initially, lumps appear, followed by swelling and pain, then chills and fevers; in severe cases, nausea and dry vomiting, with swelling of the cheeks and neck. Cauterization is to be avoided at this point; at the onset, use a fine needle to puncture the top of the affected area, placing a toad venom cake on top and covering it with a plaster to allow the toxin to escape. For swollen areas, apply a dispersing yellow powder. For those with exterior symptoms, use Jingfang Baidu San with additional Scutellaria, Coptis, and Burdock; for internal symptoms, use Huanglian Decoction. If pus has formed, use Xiong Gui Neituo San; if pus causes swelling pain, puncture it to achieve healing; after the pus drains, continue using the plaster for easy healing.

If the mustache turns white, it indicates depleted kidney essence and dry blood in the channels; either condition can lead to white mustaches, and the best remedy is a preparation of Rehmannia.

At forty, your eyebrows will fall, and you will die six months after that.\" He instructed him to take the Wushi Decoction to avoid this. Zhongxuan disliked his words and took the decoction but did not consume it. Three days later, Zhongjing asked him: \"Did you take the decoction?\" Zhongxuan replied: \"I have taken it.\" Zhongjing said: \"The complexion is not indicative of taking the decoction; why do you take your life lightly?\" Zhongxuan still did not believe him. Twenty years later, his eyebrows indeed fell out, and one hundred eighty-seven days after that, he died, thus fulfilling Zhongjing's words. The \"Danxi Heart Method\" states: \"A youth named Hu, aged seventeen or eighteen, lost all his hair without leaving a single strand. His diet and daily routines were normal, his pulse was weak and taut yet equal in strength. I said: 'This is due to excessive flavors leading to phlegm-damp in the diaphragm. Additionally, eating too many plums will sour and collect the damp-heat phlegm, which rises to the head, steaming the blood at the hair roots, gradually leading to dryness and eventual hair loss.' I then prescribed blood-tonifying and dispersing herbs, using Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder without the Mangxiao, and only Da Huang stir-fried three times with wine, combined with Siwu Decoction prepared with wine to make a small dose. I frequently administered this with gray decoction in water for over two months. Upon re-evaluation of his pulse, the damp-heat was gradually resolved, and I halted the medicine, adjusting with mild nourishment.
