<p><strong>Phlegm Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Plain Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyin is at the spring; the dampness overcomes, leading to heart pain from fluid accumulation among the people. <em>(Note: The Taiyin at the spring corresponds to the years of Chen and Xu, where fluid accumulation causes heart pain, indicating that cold damp rises). The victory of the Taiyin uniquely overcomes, causing internal dampness to accumulate and fluid to appear above. The recovery of the Taiyin comes when the dampness transforms and the fluid arises from within.</em><br><em>(Note: This occurs when the fire and earth combine before the midpoint of the year. The unique victor refers to the cold damp aspect, which recovers after the midpoint of the year, leading to internal dampness that presses on the lower abdomen. The fluid emerging from within and swelling above indicates the water pathogen rises from below, between, and above. Recovery refers to overcoming the defeated qi, extreme accumulation, and subsequent rebound.)</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Five Constants</strong> </p>
<p>The Taiyang governs the heavens; dampness transforms materials, causing internal fluid to accumulate.<br><em>(Note: The Taiyang governs the heavens, thus the Taiyin damp earth resides at the spring, resulting in the onset of damp-related illnesses.)</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on the Six Elements</strong></p>
<p>When the Taiyin arrives, there will be accumulating drinking or obstruction.<br>[Note: This is common in spring sickness.]<br>When the Taiyin arrives, it will yield abundant grain.<br>[Note: This is common in summer sickness.]<br>Shaoyin governs the affairs of heaven, and when the four seasonal energies cause the people&#39;s sickness, there will be drinking and outbreaks.<br>[Note: This is due to the influence of damp and hot energies, hence the outbreaks.]<br>When the earth accumulates, the people&#39;s sickness manifests as drinking and downpour.<br>[Note: This is all due to the influence of damp earth energies.]</p>
<p><strong>The Great Treatise on the Changing Energies</strong></p>
<p>In a year when the earth is excessive, rain and dampness spread, kidney water becomes affected by evil influences, leading to severe drinking outbreaks, reduced appetite, and fullness in the abdomen.<br>[Note: Earth refers to its element in the ground, and dampness refers to its element in the sky; thus, in those years, the earth&#39;s energy becomes excessive, and rain and dampness spread. Drinking refers to the spleen&#39;s inability to transport and transform, resulting in phlegm and fluid accumulation. Fullness and reduced appetite arise because of earth deficiency, which cannot assist in transformation. When such excesses occur, they reverse the original deficiency and cause self-harm, leading to these sicknesses emerging at the time the earth&#39;s energy attains its proper position in the eighteen days of the seasonal months.]  </p>
<p><strong>The Ling Shu Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Disease Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the skin becomes coarse like the scales of a dried fish, it indicates internal fluid accumulation.<br>[Note: The description of dried fish scales indicates cold sensations on the skin. Cold represents the energy of water; thus, the water evil accumulates internally, manifesting cold appearances externally.]<br><strong>The Essentials of the Golden Chamber</strong> [by Zhang Ji of the Han dynasty]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>A question was asked: There are four types of fluids, what are they? The teacher replied: There are phlegm fluid, suspended fluid, abundant fluid, and obstructive fluid. </p>
<p>The question was: How do the four types differ? The teacher said: The person who was once robust but is now thin has water moving in the intestines, making a dripping sound; this is called phlegm fluid. If after drinking the water lingers under the ribs, causing coughing and pain, this is called suspended fluid. If the water flows to the limbs, resulting in heaviness and pain, especially when sweating is not present, this is called abundant fluid. If coughing and difficulty lying down occur, with the person appearing swollen, this is called obstructive fluid. </p>
<p>Water in the heart causes hardness beneath the heart, leading to shortness of breath and aversion to drinking. Water in the lungs leads to expectoration of phlegm and a desire to drink. Water in the spleen causes slight breathlessness and heaviness in the body. Water in the liver causes fullness under the ribs, with sneezing and pain. Water in the kidneys leads to palpitations. Retained fluid under the heart makes the person&#39;s back cold, feeling like the size of a palm. </p>
<p>For those with retained fluid, there is pain under the ribs extending to the lower back, and coughing usually alleviates it. If there is retained fluid in the chest, the person experiences shortness of breath and thirst, with pain in the limbs at the joints. A sinking pulse indicates retained fluid. </p>
<p>With phlegm above the diaphragm, fullness leads to wheezing and coughing; there may be alternating chills and fever, lower back pain, and spontaneous tears; such a person will shake and tremble, surely having underlying fluid issues. </p>
<p>Patients who drink too much water inevitably suffer from intense wheezing. Generally, if food intake is low and water intake is high, water may accumulate beneath the heart; in severe cases, this leads to palpitations, and in milder cases, to shortness of breath. A double-string pulse signifies coldness, while all severe cases after a major purge show deficiency. A pulse that is slightly stringy indicates fluid presence. Lung fluid does not present as a stringy pulse but rather indicates wheezing and shortness of breath.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If the person has edema and is unable to lie down, with shortness of breath but a normal pulse, then for phlegm and fluid retention, warm herbs should be used to harmonize it. </p>
<p>If there is phlegm and fluid in the chest and diaphragm, causing fullness in the chest and sides, along with dizziness, the Ling Gui Zhu Gan decoction is indicated. For shortness of breath with slight fluid retention, it should be resolved through urination; the same decoction is indicated, as well as Shen Qi Wan. </p>
<p>If the patient&#39;s pulse is faint and they wish to have a bowel movement, but the result is dissatisfying, and despite having a movement, there remains fullness below the heart, this is due to retained fluid wanting to be eliminated; the Gan Sui Ban Xia decoction is indicated. </p>
<p>If the pulse is floating, thin, and slippery, injury from fluid is present. A pulse that is tight and rapid indicates cold fluids, which are difficult to treat in both winter and summer. </p>
<p>If the pulse is deep and wiry, it suggests internal pain from suspended fluids. In the case of suspended fluids, the Shi Zao decoction is indicated. </p>
<p>For excessive fluids, inducing sweat is necessary; the Da Qing Long decoction and the Xiao Qing Long decoction are both indicated. </p>
<p>In cases of fluid accumulation in the diaphragm where the individual experiences breathlessness, fullness, and hardness below the heart, with a dark complexion and a tight, deep pulse, if lingering for several days and treatment with vomiting or purging proves ineffective, the Zhu Fang Ji decoction is indicated. If they are deficient, they will recover; if they are excess, they may relapse after three days. For cases that do not improve, it is advisable to use the Zhu Fang Ji decoction without gypsum and add Fu Ling and Mang Xiao decoction. </p>
<p>If there are fluids beneath the heart causing the person distress and dizziness, the Ze Xie decoction is indicated. For phlegm and fullness in the chest, the Hou Po Da Huang decoction is indicated.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>If there is a retained fluid causing discomfort, use the Tang of large dates and artemisia to treat it. If someone who typically experiences vomiting is not thirsty, it is due to retained fluid in the lower abdomen, treated with Xiao Ban Xia Decoction. If there is abdominal fullness and dryness of the mouth and tongue, this indicates water qi in the intestines, treated with Ji Jiao Li Huang Wan. For sudden vomiting, distention below the heart, water in the diaphragm, and dizziness, use Ban Xia Jia Fu Ling Decoction. If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel, produces saliva and foam, and feels dizzy, this indicates water, treated with Wu Ling San. For a patient with a cough and wiry pulse, indicating water, use Shi Zao Tang. </p>
<p>For those with retained phlegm and chest pain, if they do not die suddenly, expect them to recover within a hundred days to a year; treat with Shi Zao Tang. Chronic cough lasting several years, with a weak pulse can be treated, but with a strong pulse, the prognosis is poor. If the pulse is weak, they will suffer from fever and discomfort, as they likely have retained fluid in the chest, thus should be treated for excess fluid. </p>
<p>If a patient experiences vomiting before feeling thirsty, it indicates a desire for relief; if they feel thirsty before vomiting, it means water has pooled below the heart, indicating retained fluid. A person who usually feels thirsty but now does not is likely due to retained fluid below the heart, indicating fluid retention. </p>
<p>Walnuts should not be consumed in excess, as they can provoke phlegm and fluid.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>Whenever there is water in the heart, the person experiences palpitations, shortness of breath, and fear; they may feel dizzy and delusional. If the condition arises from cold, it is seen as deficiency; if from heat, it is seen as excess. Thus, if water is in the heart, the individual’s chest feels tight, palpitates with short breaths, dislikes water and does not wish to drink. If water is in the lungs, they may spit saliva and desire to drink. If water is in the spleen, the person feels fatigued and heavy all over. If water is in the liver, they may experience fullness under the ribs, sneezing, and pain. If water is in the kidneys, they will experience palpitations in the chest.</p>
<p>A patient who suddenly drinks a lot of water will certainly suffer from acute asthma. Generally, if food intake is low but water consumption is high, water stagnates in the heart, leading to severe palpitations or mildly to shortness of breath. A double-string pulse indicates cold; all these conditions lead to a preference for deficiency after significant bowel movement. A side-string pulse indicates the presence of fluid. If there is lung fluid without a string-like pulse, there is a tendency for shortness of breath. If there is fluid retention, one might also experience asthma and an inability to sleep, along with shortness of breath and a smooth pulse. </p>
<p>In cases of retained fluid, there are no outward signs, and without heat, the pulse is weak; the individual will feel fullness and cannot eat. A deep and slippery pulse indicates the illness of retained fluid. In those with retained fluid, pain may radiate from the sides to the lower back, leading to severe coughing; individuals may cough and feel unable to lie down, experiencing neck pain while coughing, resembling a condition seen in children with convulsions. If fluid is accumulated in the chest, the person will feel short of breath and thirsty, with pain in the limbs and joints; a deep pulse indicates the presence of retained fluid.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If there is retained fluid in the chest, the person has a cold sensation on their back, and it feels as large as a hand. If the patient has a raised shoulder and difficulty breathing, these indicate fluid overflow in the chest. In chronic cases, there may be fullness like a pot and severe swelling resembling a horse’s knife, caused by phlegm-fluid. The illness above the diaphragm presents as fullness, wheezing, coughing, and expectoration, with alternating chills and fevers, back pain and aversion to cold, and weeping of the eyes. The person may shake or tremble, indicating hidden fluid. If one arm is unresponsive, sometimes shifting to the other arm, and the pulse is deep and thin, this is not wind but rather fluid present in the upper burner. A weak pulse indicates slight exhaustion because the qi of the nutritive and defensive systems is not circulating properly. In winter, recovery occurs naturally. </p>
<p>For treating suspended fluid, use Shizao Decoction. If there is sweating and coughing with difficulty in breathing, this is fluid accumulation. In cases of excessive fluid, one should induce sweating, and Xiao Qinglong Decoction is the primary remedy. Fan Wang used Da Qinglong Decoction.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Living Person&#39;s Book</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Zhu Gong)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>When phlegm is present in the Middle Palace (the central area of the abdomen), it causes dislike of cold, fever, aversion to wind, spontaneous sweating, and a feeling of fullness in the chest and diaphragm, resembling a case of typhoid fever. However, there is no headache and no stiffness in the neck, which is a distinguishing feature. I often observe damp phlegm stagnating in the neck and back, sometimes feeling numb or stiff, with a pulse that is floating and slippery but not tight.  </p>
<p><strong>Jisheng Prescription</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Yan Yonghe)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>There are six types of drinking: suspended drinking, overflowing drinking, support drinking, phlegm drinking, retained drinking, and lurking drinking; Nesting Shi has detailed these well. Pang Anchang often said: &quot;If there is no phlegm above in the human body, then there is no water flowing upstream in the world.&quot; Truly wise words! From this perspective, the pathway of human qi is valued for being smooth; when it flows smoothly, bodily fluids circulate, and there will be no concern about phlegm or drink. If regulation and restraint are not appropriate, the qi pathway becomes obstructed, resulting in water and drink stagnating in the chest and forming phlegm. The symptoms of this illness are not one but many: it can lead to wheezing, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, palpitations, cold and hot pains, swelling, fullness, and constipation, all caused by phlegm or drink. If you examine the pulse, a firm or slippery pulse indicates drink. </p>
<p>As for the method of treating drink, it may involve purging or sweating, warming or benefiting; these are fixed methods. The foolish might think that the difference between warming and benefiting could be harmless, but if purging or sweating is misapplied, it leads to substantial illness. It is better to prioritize smoothing the qi first and then guiding it afterward. When the qi is smooth, bodily fluids circulate, phlegm and drink are moved downward, and are expelled through urination. Those with illnesses that make them want to spit phlegm and find relief from taking Eight Ingredients Pills can also have some intention behind their actions. Wang Shuhe said: &quot;The kidneys are cold and produce much saliva.&quot; The kidneys are the organs of water; they can receive and manage water, and when kidney qi is warm and harmonious, fluids descend. When kidney qi is deficient and cold, pathogenic water rises instead. To counter this, mountain cornelian, yam, and similar herbs are used for nourishment, while aconite and cinnamon are used for warmth, and poria and water plantain for diuresis; this reasoning is indeed correct. During an acute illness, one should examine the situation carefully and in detail.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Accumulated Fluid</p>
<p>Accumulated fluid refers to the retention of liquid without dispersing. When water becomes dry, it dissipates; when it becomes moist, it does not dissipate, leading to accumulated fluid. Damp soil is responsible for this condition. Wine is hot in nature and induces coldness; when cold and hot coexist in the chest, they do not disperse and lead to dampness, resulting in phlegm. In severe cases, it is advisable to expel it. After expulsion, taking wuling and ganlu, which are effective in overcoming dampness and eliminating phlegm, is recommended.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p>
<h3>The Confucian Way of Filial Piety</h3>
<h4>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</h4>
<p>Drinking should be moderated based on the temperature of the water and the severity of the discussion.</p>
<p>Retention of fluids is simply the accumulation of water. In Wang&#39;s &quot;Pulse Canon,&quot; it is classified into four types: phlegm retention, suspended fluids, obstructive fluids, and overflow of fluids. &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; further categorizes it into five, all defined by the presentation of the illness. I shall not elaborate on these classifications now. The reasons for fluid retention can be traced to five causes: 1) arising from frustration and anger, 2) from exhaustion, 3) from deep contemplation, 4) from excessive drinking, and 5) from harm caused by heat during cold seasons. Although there are many manifestations of fluid retention, they all fall into these categories.</p>
<p>When frustration and anger are suppressed, the liver energy affects the spleen, leading to failure in digestion and hence fluid retention. The liver governs thought; prolonged indecision restricts the flow of bodily energies, resulting in fluid retention. For those who work hard and travel long distances, exhaustion leads them to drink, and with weakened spleen and stomach, they may feel lethargic and unable to disperse energy through the pulses, which also results in fluid retention.</p>
<p>Excessive drinking fills the stomach and intestines; further consumption exceeds the bladder&#39;s ability to excrete, leading to prolonged fluid retention. Additionally, in extreme heat, bodily fluids may dry up, leading one to crave cold water. In an attempt to quench thirst, excessive consumption leads to stagnation, resulting in fluid retention as well.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If a person suffers from the sickness of drinking, can they possibly go beyond these five issues? Water is a yin substance; when it accumulates, it produces humidity, and when liquor stagnates, it generates dryness. Over time, this leads to phlegm. If phlegm forms on the left side, it corresponds to excess fat; on the right side, it corresponds to the nature of breath. If it enters the lungs, it causes frequent coughing; if it enters the large intestine, it leads to diarrhea; if it enters the kidneys, it results in retention of water. This condition presents as a bag filled with fluid, unable to move upwards or downwards. Placed under sunlight, it becomes a form of edema—these ailments stem from rebellious qi. </p>
<p>Thus, when humidity is present above, the eyes turn yellow and the face swells; when it is below, the thighs and knees become swollen and numb; when it is in the middle, there is fullness and stagnation in the chest. If phlegm remains in the yang and does not disperse, over time, it transforms into qi; if it remains in the yin and does not disperse, it eventually solidifies. In contemporary treatments, it is commonly stated that drinking leads to cold accumulation, thus using damp-heat remedies to counteract the dryness. However, coldness from drink in the middle is treated with heat remedies from above, which are rebuffed by coldness, and moisture has not been resolved, resulting instead in increased heart fire. </p>
<p>When the fire does not descend, water flows back down, causing desiccation in the upper burner and chill in the lower. The &quot;Nei Jing&quot; states that if the cycles of entering and exiting are dysfunctional, the spirit and transformations become extinguished. If rising and descending are obstructed, qi becomes isolated and perilous. Can this not be taken seriously? Moreover, retaining fluid does not have any restorative treatments, and when qi is blocked and obstructed, supplementation only worsens the condition. Do we not understand the “Nei Jing,” which states that retained fluids should be attacked? Why do later generations not diligently study the ancients? Additionally, using herbs like white atractylodes, ginseng, and poria for those who drink only increases obstructions. How much more so when employing fire needling and moxibustion for bloating can the situation be understood?<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>In the past, practitioners used more than thirty ingredients for the Wuyin Pill, which included minerals like alum stone, as well as herbs such as pungent herbs and Aconite. Although these were purgative, they all shared the properties of dryness and heat. While there were also cooling herbs included, they lacked the strength to balance out the formula. Therefore, in modern times, Liu Hejian based his formulation of the Sanhua Shenyouwan on Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Shizao Decoction, and added Da Huang (rhubarb) and Qian Niu (cowherb), yielding a remedy that could expel illness after taking thirty to fifty pills, allowing the harmful energy to flow out. </p>
<p>There was once a patient suffering from this condition for decades who came to me for diagnosis. The pulse on the left hand was weak and small across three positions, while the right hand exhibited a slippery and large pulse in the same three positions. The weak and small pulse indicated cold, while the slippery and large pulse signified dryness. I prescribed watermelon seed powder to expel their cold phlegm, resulting in several liters of sweat. Next, I employed a method to guide out the dry and dirty matter from their intestines and stomach, which also amounted to several liters. The patient improved by half; then I used a mild remedy to continue releasing the remaining buildup and a fire-reducing medicine to open the appetite. Within a month, the patient was completely healed.</p>
<p>Coptis and Phellodendron can clear away the excess heat and dampness above, while Astragalus and Poria can support the drainage of dampness below. The former can restrain what comes after but should not be used to drive out what comes first. Any remaining issues may be treated with bitter herbs like bitter thorn and apricot kernels, as well as mulberry root and peppercorns to expel water. All excess water should be eliminated. </p>
<p>In treating illness, there is an order to follow and one must not act chaotically. When the harmful energy is not yet expelled, one must be cautious about supplementation. When the great evil has just receded, there is a fear that it may rebound and intensify, becoming worse than before treatment.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>In the past, there was a person in Henei who fell ill from drinking. The doctor diagnosed him with dampness in the spleen and prescribed a formulation of costus and skylark root, which he ingested more than ten times. The doctor then deceived the patient by altering the formula into pills and had him take them again for over ten times. This was followed by changing the pills back into a powder, which he took once more for over ten times. The patient became increasingly exhausted, sleeping for nearly a whole day and night. When he finally awoke, his stomach felt spacious, and he only craved a small amount of porridge. Day by day, he improved. Although they both diagnosed him with dampness, the methods of tonifying and purging differed greatly, leading to such a distinction.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When the Earth element is excessive, rainy humidity spreads. The water from the kidneys is affected by evil influences, leading to an excessive accumulation of fluids. The Taiyang (Greater Yang) oversees Heaven, where humidity changes substances, causing internal accumulation of fluids that disrupt appetite. It is noted that this year, the Yin is in the springs, with dampness monitored by the Earth. The source of the illness arises from the Earth’s Qi. The Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) oversees Heaven, with damp Earth constituting the four aspects of Qi, resulting in nasal congestion, nosebleeds, and excessive fluids. Moreover, with damp Earth builds up, people suffer from fluid retention, edema, and heaviness in their bodies. When Taiyin (Greater Yin) arrives, it leads to an accumulation of yin and obstruction. The arrival of Taiyin causes ample accumulation; both the supremacy of Taiyin and its return are associated with fluid accumulation internally.</p>
<p>In light of this, it is understood that Earth governs the transformation of dampness but not cold, while Water governs the transformation of cold but not dampness. When there is frequent rainfall and the Earth accumulates puddles, it is considered as Water. The canon attributes this to Earth, stating frost and ice solidify, with the windy atmosphere being cold; this is the transformation of Water. Therefore, it is said that Chou and Wei (the Ox and Goat) represent the dampness of Earth, while Chen and Xu (the Dragon and Dog) represent the coldness of Water. The two transformations originate from different elements, leading to distinct ailments. When damp Earth is excessive, fluids accumulate internally. While some people believe that insufficient Spleen Earth is the issue, can ancient texts be easily interpreted? Should they be followed? Or not?<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm Illness</strong></p>
<p>In general, when a person suffers from phlegm, there are five main types of symptoms: the first is wind phlegm, the second is heat phlegm, the third is damp phlegm, the fourth is alcoholic phlegm, and the fifth is food phlegm. These phlegms reside in the diaphragm, causing the head and eyes to feel unclear and heavy, with thick mucus and saliva, or resulting in cough, wheezing, and fullness. Sometimes there may be tidal fever, and one can use Dusheng Powder to expel it. Next, one may take the modified Decoction or Fengsou Pills, or Liangge Powder alternately. The <em>Inner Canon</em> states this refers to the concept of flowing dampness and moistening dryness.</p>
<p>For phlegm illnesses, there are five types: wind phlegm, heat phlegm, damp phlegm, alcoholic phlegm, and food phlegm. When phlegm is present in the upper stomach, it can harm the head because all yang gathers there. This causes patients to feel heaviness in the head with watery eyes and thick mucus, or to cough and wheeze. Occasionally, there can be chills and fever; in such cases, one can take Red Adzuki Bean Soup to expel it. After vomiting, one should treat according to the symptoms, taking remedies to dispel wind, eliminate heat, drain dampness, and transform phlegm, such as Tongsheng Powder with half-sliced Pinellia to guide qi—what a marvelous approach! </p>
<p>For those recently afflicted with wind phlegm, they tend to feel cold and drink cold beverages; heat phlegm is produced when fire is excessive, and damp phlegm results from stagnant fluids. One can take modified Lianqiao Decoction, Dampness-Removing Pills, or Wuyou Powder. Those with alcoholic phlegm can use Jiedu San Sheng Pills. Lastly, for food phlegm, one may use Han Fangji Pills or select Dan Sha for application. Following these prescriptions will undoubtedly yield miraculous effects.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Expectoration Method</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm located above the chest and diaphragm, when full and solid, cannot be expelled without expectoration. Zhongjing said: The great method is to expel during spring. This is because in spring the yang qi rises, and both human qi and pathogenic qi are also elevated, thus it is appropriate to expel. The medicines for expectoration can be in the form of pills or powders, and one should stop once the primary ailment is addressed; there is no need to exhaust the dosage, as excess can be harmful. Thus, although there are urgent situations throughout the four seasons requiring expulsion, one does not necessarily have to wait for spring; however, Zhongjing emphasized it as a principal method. Today, people do not grasp this method and have abandoned it entirely. Let us briefly list a few notable prescriptions: In Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; there is the scallion and fermented soybean soup to expel headaches, gardenia and magnolia bark decoction to expel vexation, and melon stalk powder to expel cold damage for those experiencing fullness in the lower abdomen after diarrhea with no sweat and wheezing; the &quot;Prescriptions of Historical Medical Texts&quot; prescribes the rare saliva powder to expel internal fullness of the diaphragm, phlegmy cough, loss of voice, and tightly clenched jaws, as if one has lost their spirit; the &quot;Comprehensive Prescriptions&quot; uses the kurbute powder to expel headaches and dizziness, with aversion to wind and nausea; the &quot;Universal Relief Prescriptions&quot; utilizes the wind-catching powder to expel inability to open the mouth, with loss of consciousness; the &quot;General Compilation Prescriptions&quot; includes common mountain herbs for expelling malaria; the &quot;Sun Shang Recipes&quot; employs the Three Holy powder to expel mania; and the &quot;Proven Efficacy Formulas&quot; addresses tongue misalignment.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The high ones will overpower it.&quot; Wang Bing explains: &quot;When the upper is excessive, it should be expelled.&quot; Zhong Jing adds: &quot;If food stagnates in the upper abdomen, it should be vomited; also, if there is wine accumulated in the upper abdomen, it should likewise be vomited.&quot; Furthermore, he states: &quot;If a patient has cold extremities, and the pulses of both hands are intermittently tight, indicating that pathogenic qi is in the chest, with fullness under the heart causing anxiety and an inability to eat, it is known that the ailment lies in the chest, and it should be vomited.&quot; I now apply the vomiting method according to Zhong Jing&#39;s formula. I use Gua Ti San to induce vomiting for headache due to pathogenic cold, and a scallion and fermented soybean soup to induce vomiting for miscellaneous headaches. Sometimes, using only Gua Ti San, known as &quot;Dú Shèng,&quot; with a bit of tea powder to expel phlegm; or adding a whole scorpion&#39;s tail to induce vomiting for stabbing pain in the sides that is gurgling with sound. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions that dampness in the upper part should be expelled with bitter substances; is this not what it refers to? Nowadays, there are those who also use vomiting, but sometimes it succeeds and sometimes it fails, with some unable to expel or stop the outpour; they do not understand that the method of ascending and expelling is called &quot;lifting phlegm,&quot; and the character &quot;lifting&quot; itself encompasses capturing and releasing. Recently, there was a physician who induced vomiting in a woman, and she could not stop for half a month, with saliva accumulating to several buckets, her life hanging by a thread, in a state of panic and miscalculation, seeking my solution. I instructed to brew a musk soup, which resolved the issue immediately upon ingestion.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Someone asked: How does musk stop vomiting? I replied: The melon seedlings die upon smelling musk. Now, the vomiting remedy with watermelon seeds is meant to resolve this. If colocynth causes continuous vomiting, it is resolved with scallion white soup; if stone medicine causes continuous vomiting, it is resolved with licorice soup. Only for grass and trees causing vomiting, musk is used as an antidote. According to the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica,&quot; the medicines that induce bitter cold vomiting include fermented soybeans, watermelon seeds, tea leaves, gardenia, coptis, bitter smartweed, and rhubarb; those that are acrid and cold include turmeric, common mountain herb, and colocynth; sweet and cold includes the juice of rehmannia; bitter but warm are aromatic wood,远志, and magnolia; acrid and warm include mint and peony; acrid are grains of various species and scallion roots; acrid and cold include light powder; acrid and sweet but warm include aconite and the tip of prepared aconite; sour and cold are alum, green vitriol, and sap; sour and neutral include verdigris; sweet and sour but neutral are red adzuki beans; sour and warm are rice porridge; sour, acrid, and cold include orpiment; sour and cold include white rice; spicy and salty but warm include soap pod; very salty and cold include table salt and green salt; sweet and cold includes tooth nitrate; sweet and slightly warm includes ginseng reed; sweet and spicy but hot includes scorpion tail.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Among the thirty-six substances, only Changshan, Alum, and Gourd Seeds have slight toxicity; Li Lu, Yuanhua, Qingfen, and Aconite Tails are toxic. The other twenty-six are non-toxic purgatives, and one should choose and use them according to the symptoms. This method should start with a small dose, without causing overwhelming effects, and gradually increase the amount. For those who struggle to expel phlegm, use a probe such as a pin or chicken feather to extract it; if it does not come out, apply juices to aid in expulsion. Continue probing while applying, as all should eventually be expelled. If vomiting leads to dizziness or headaches, drinking ice water will immediately relieve the symptoms; if ice water is unavailable, fresh spring water can also be taken. Strong individuals can be fine after a single purge, while weaker ones may require three or four purges, which should not cause harm. Some may feel significantly better the next day, while others may worsen, as the effects of purging may still be taking hold; in such cases, wait a few days before attempting to purge again. If one feels thirsty, fresh water, melons, and cool foods are acceptable, but one should avoid overeating or heavy, hard-to-digest dishes. Once the heart fire is subdued, the middle burner will harmonize, and yin energy will strengthen. It is crucial to avoid excessive sexual activity and to manage great worries or anger. Adhere to these precautions and do not heed unsubstantiated rumors. Only purge after gaining genuine understanding of the condition, as this will ensure safety.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phlegm Disease</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is floating, and one should induce vomiting. If the pulse has long been thin, it will be difficult to resolve suddenly, and one must be diligent in treatment. Generally, when treating phlegm, excessive use of purging medicines can lead to deficiency of the spleen qi, making phlegm easier to form and increase. For damp phlegm, use Atractylodes and White Atractylodes; for heat phlegm, use Indigo and the properties of Coptis and Scutellaria; for food phlegm, use Shén Qū (medicated leaven), malt, and hawthorn; for wind phlegm, use Nansh (Arisaema); for chronic phlegm, use Haishi (sea stones), Banxia (Pinellia), and herbs like Xianhe (Corydalis), and take them in pill form. If phlegm is in the diaphragm, one must use vomiting methods; purging will not be effective. Wind phlegm often presents with unusual symptoms, while damp phlegm commonly brings fatigue and weakness. If the qi is solid and phlegm heat is stagnated above, inducing vomiting will be difficult. Clear phlegm is associated with cold; use formulas like Erchen Tang. For thick and turbid phlegm, inducing vomiting is essential. Heat phlegm combined with wind shows more external symptoms. Treat the heat with clearing methods, and for food accumulation, use aggressive treatments, combined with qi tonics to help it descend. If phlegm is caused by excessive fire rising, one should prioritize clearing the fire using substances like White Atractylodes, Scutellaria, and soft gypsum. </p>
<p>For internally caused phlegm, one must use medicines like Ginseng and Astragalus, often combined with ginger juice for transmission, or add Banxia for stronger effects; if the deficiency is severe, add bamboo juice, and if the central qi is insufficient, add Ginseng and Atractylodes. </p>
<p>Phlegm as a substance rises and falls with the qi, present everywhere. For those with spleen deficiency, tonifying spleen qi and clearing central qi to facilitate phlegm descent is recommended, using formulas like Erchen Tang with added White Atractylodes, along with raising herbs like Cimicifuga.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>In the middle jiao, if there is phlegm combined with food accumulation leading to illness, the stomach qi is also reliant on nourishment, and it should not be rashly attacked; if it is entirely expelled, there will be deficiency. Phlegm that has formed into clumps or cannot be expectorated, compounded by qi stagnation, phlegm dampness, or phlegm heat, is all difficult to treat. Phlegm located between the intestines and stomach can be resolved through expelling it. When it is in the meridians, it must be expelled through vomiting. The method of vomiting inherently includes a dispersing principle.</p>
<p>If epilepsy is caused by fright, then fright causes the spirit to leave its residence; when the residence is empty, phlegm is generated. When the blood and qi enter the residence and repel the spirit, it cannot return. For blood injuries, ginger juice must be used to facilitate movement. Huangqin treats heat phlegm, allowing one to clear the fire. Bamboo juice smooths phlegm, and only through ginger juice can it travel through the meridians. Wubeizi can treat chronic phlegm, assisting other medicines in effectively treating stubborn phlegm. Erchen Decoction can address all types of phlegm in the body; if one needs downward action, they should add herbs that guide downward, and if upward action is needed, they should add herbs that guide upward.</p>
<p>In general, when using vomiting herbs, it is advisable to raise and lift the qi to facilitate vomiting. Herbs such as Fangfeng, Yanzhi, Chuanxiong, Jiegang, Yacha, and fresh ginger, or the use of wax gourd stem powder can be utilized.</p>
<p>For cases of wind-phlegm disease, wind-phlegm medicines must be used, such as BaiFuzhi, Tianma, Xionghuang, Niuhuang, Pianqing, Jiangcan, and Zhuya Zaojiao. </p>
<p>In any individual, if there are masses found in the upper, middle, or lower body, they are often phlegm. After inquiring what they usually like to eat, one should use medication after expelling.</p>
<p>Scholar Xu used Cangzhu to treat phlegm that formed into a pocket, it was extraordinarily effective. Phlegm, combined with stagnant blood, ultimately resulted in the formation of this pocket.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>In cases of dizziness and noise, it indicates the phlegm caused by fire. Use Er Chen Tang with added gardenia fruit, yellow locust root, and yellow gentian. If there is acidity in the breath, this signifies food stagnation with heat and an upward movement of fire. Use yellow gentian as the main ingredient, with pinellia and nascent ginger as deputies, and tangerine peel as a messenger. If there is excess heat, add indigo.</p>
<p>For phlegm under the ribs, only white mustard seeds can reach it. If phlegm is beneath the skin and outer layers, ginger juice and bamboo juice must be used to guide it. For phlegm in the limbs, bamboo juice is essential to release it. For phlegm congestion in the throat that is dry and cannot be expelled or swallowed, use phlegm-transforming herbs paired with salty tastes to soften the masses (e.g., pinellia, apricot kernel, sea stone, balloon flower, and forsythia), mixed with ginger juice and honey into lozenges for sucking.</p>
<p>Hai Fen refers to sea stone; it can reduce hot phlegm, dry damp phlegm, soften solidified phlegm, and dissolve stubborn phlegm. It may be used in pill form but not in decoctions. Bitter orange can expel phlegm, capable of breaking down walls. Xiao Wei Dan treats phlegm heat in the diaphragm, wind phlegm, damp phlegm, and pain in the shoulders, but it may deplete stomach qi and should be used sparingly for those with food accumulation and solid phlegm. Shen Yu Wan can dissipate phlegm.</p>
<p>If there is something stuck in the throat that cannot be coughed out or swallowed, this is old phlegm. In severe cases, it should be expelled; in milder cases, use pinellia varieties. If there is excessive qi, definitely use Jing Li.</p>
<p>Tian Hua Fen can significantly reduce heat phlegm in the diaphragm. Phlegm in the diaphragm can cause madness or forgetfulness. For wind phlegm, bamboo juice should also be used, and it can nourish the blood, serving the same purpose as Jing Li.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Those who can tolerate heavier foods should use these two ingredients for quick and stable effects. The two infusions treat phlegm that is lodged under the skin and in the meridians, which must be assisted with ginger juice. Leek juice treats stagnant blood that is not circulating, and if there is fluid in the middle burner, consuming two or three cups of fresh juice will cause restlessness in the chest, but later provides relief. </p>
<p>Phlegm can cause various issues such as wheezing, coughing, vomiting, discomfort, dizziness, noise in the stomach, palpitations, chills, heat, pain, swelling, a feeling of blockage, sounds in the chest and ribs, or a constant cold sensation in the back and heart, as well as numbness in the limbs. These are all caused by phlegm and fluid accumulation. To effectively treat phlegm, one does not treat the phlegm directly but adjusts the qi. When the qi is smooth, all bodily fluids will also flow accordingly.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The ancient method for treating phlegm through sweating, purging, and warming has, in my view, less merit than prioritizing the regulation of qi and then guiding it in a proper direction. Wang Yinjun states that clear phlegm is cold, while yellow and turbid phlegm is hot. If it starts clear, it can become yellow and turbid with time. Clear and white phlegm is thin and floats above, while yellow and turbid phlegm is thick and sticky, settling below. When coughing results in easy expulsion, the phlegm is clear and white; when coughing fails to bring it up, the phlegm becomes yellow and stagnant. If phlegm is coughed up for an extended period, and humidity and heat accumulate, causing a blockage above and below, it may entirely lose its clarity, even to the point of blood being present. When the blood deteriorates, it turns into black phlegm, symptomatic of a serious, obscure condition. Furthermore, clear phlegm has a mild taste, but over time it may develop a foul flavor, becoming sour, spicy, fishy, or bitter, among other unpleasant tastes. Many diseases involve phlegm, which is not widely recognized. The human body can harbor tuberculosis, which may not be painful, red, or produce pus—this is attributed to phlegm accumulation. Effective treatment for phlegm should fundamentally involve strengthening the spleen and correcting dampness.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Additional Thoughts on Diagnosis and Treatment of Phlegm Disease</strong>  </p>
<p>Blood and qi are the essence of the body. When the essence becomes depleted, pathogenic factors can invade, possibly due to underlying conditions. If both blood and qi are deficient and phlegm resides in the middle burner, it obstructs the processes of rising and descending, leading to the dysfunction of the twelve organs. Consequently, one&#39;s perception and actions may become deluded. Treating these patients with pathogens will surely lead to death. Alas! What injustice! Who is to blame?  </p>
<p>The younger brother of Xianmu, aged seventeen or eighteen, during the summer experienced great fatigue and thirst, excessively drinking plum juice, and subsequently suffered from profound shock three to four times, leading to delusions and hallucinations, resembling a possessed state. Upon examining his pulse, both hands showed a weak and wiry pulse but were also heavy. I said, &quot;The rapid pulse indicates heat; the weak and wiry pulse reflects the profound shock.&quot; Additionally, the sourness from the plum juice had stagnated in the middle burner. To replenish the deficiency, clear heat, and expel phlegm, his condition could be stabilized.  </p>
<p>I thus prescribed a decoction of ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, scutellaria, and lonicera, mixed with bamboo sap and ginger juice for him to take. After ten days without effect, everyone criticized the inadequacy of the prescription. Upon further pulse examination, I discerned that his deficiency was incomplete and that the phlegm had not been successfully expelled. I adjusted the formula to include chrysanthemum sap and after another ten days, he recovered.  </p>
<p>My cousin, after drinking heartily one day, also exhibited nonsensical speech and delusions. Upon inquiry, it seemed that he was possessed by the spirit of his deceased brother, recounting events from his life. My uncle reprimanded him, saying, &quot;This is not the case; it is merely due to excessive consumption of fish and wine that has resulted in phlegm.&quot; A large bowl of saltwater was forced upon him, resulting in the expulsion of one to two liters of phlegm. Consequently, he sweated profusely, fell into a deep sleep for the night, and thereafter felt well.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>A woman of the Jin family, in her prime, attended a banquet in the hot season and returned home. Her mother-in-law questioned her about being out of order in her seating, causing her to blush and feel ashamed. As a result, she fell ill and became incoherent, often repeating, “I am not myself.” Her pulse was rapid and string-like. I said, “This is not an imbalance but a phlegm disorder. Just by nourishing the spleen, clearing heat, and guiding out phlegm, she should recover in a few days.” However, her family did not believe me and invited several shamans to sprinkle water and chant spells for her. After about ten days, she died. When asked why the wrongly diagnosed illness led to death so swiftly, I replied: “In the hot month attending a feast, the external environment is steaming hot, and spicy food is appetizing. Internally, she had stagnant heat, worsened by phlegm accumulation and feelings of shame and distress. How could the phlegm and heat not be overwhelming? Now, in addition, she was startled by medical measures, which frightened her spirit and unsettled her blood.”<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Spraying with medicinal water solidifies its essence and tightens its surface, preventing sweat from escaping. If sweat does not escape, then internal heat steams and burns, causing blood to become unsettled, leading to the depletion of yin and the inability of yang to stand alone. If one does not die, what is the wait for! Some say that there is a section on forbidden spells in the &quot;Essential Secrets of External Affairs,&quot; so can it be disregarded? I say: transforming essence into energy is merely a minor technique, suitable for treating small ailments. However, if there is internal deficiency and external excess, one must use a proper and grand method, which has been established and can be clearly examined. Yet, the virtue of talismanic water is only effective for heat phlegm in the stomach; a sip of cool water can alleviate stomach heat, which can indeed bring comfort. But if there is internal injury and deficiency, combined with the severe cold of winter, swallowing talismanic water will certainly freeze the stomach and cause harm. When there is stagnant heat above and heat pathogens on the surface, sweat must be released to resolve it. If one achieves coolness while the skin pores remain firm and tight, how can the heat be resolved? This must lead to internal attack, separating yin and yang, and causing blood and qi to conflict, bringing death ever closer.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm Illness Emetic Method</strong></p>
<p>Emetic Method: Use a combination of tea buds, thin water, ginger juice, a little vinegar, and a small amount of Luosang powder, along with fangfeng and jiegeng to stimulate the qi, facilitating vomiting. Emetic Method: Use aconite tips, jiegeng, ginseng, melon stems, Lilu, mugwort leaves, tea buds, etc. These can induce vomiting on their own without needing to probe with the hand; both the medicine and broth can induce vomiting. Emetic Method: First use cloth to tie around the shoulders and waist in a place without ventilation to perform this method. Grind half a sheng of radish seeds and strain with a bowl of pulpy water, then mix in a little oil and honey, and drink when it’s warm. Afterwards, use a goose feather to induce vomiting. When using a goose feather, it must be soaked in tung oil and washed with soapberry water to remove fat, then dried for use. Another method: Use half a pound of shrimp with shells, boiled with garlic, scallions, ginger, and other spices to make a broth. First eat the shrimp, followed by drinking the broth, and use a feather to induce vomiting, making sure to tightly constrict the abdomen.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All stagnant qi belongs to the lung metal. When lung qi is stagnant, it generates heat; when heat is excessive, it produces phlegm. Danxi notes: From heat comes accumulation, from accumulation comes phlegm, which carries blood stasis and leads to the formation of lumps; this is the sequence for the symptoms of stagnation, pain, and reversed stomach issues. Wang Yinjun mentions that the phlegm syndrome has not been clearly detailed in ancient and modern times. Although medical texts differentiate between various types of fluids—suspended, retained, supporting, and phlegm fluids—there is little understanding of their source as a disease. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, tinnitus; or spasms of the mouth and eyes, itchiness in the eyebrows and ears; or swelling and stiffness in the limbs that feels like pain but is not; or tooth and cheek pain, with gingival swelling, presenting different levels of pain and itch; or acid regurgitation, noisy belching; or difficulty swallowing, with what is coughed up appearing like blackened coal, resembling torn cotton, peach resin, or clam meat; or a feeling beneath the heart like ice, with cold pain at times; or strange dreams of ghosts; or weakness in the legs and ankles, sudden back pain; or general aches in the joints of the limbs without a specific pattern, even leading to numbness in the hands and pain in the arms, resembling sprains; or a painful area in the spine the size of a palm, similar to ice cold; or a feeling throughout the body as if insects are crawling; or itching along the eyes, mouth sores, and tongue ulcers, severe enough to cause a feeling of a closed throat; or lumps around the neck that resemble throat cancer but are not; or a sensation in the chest and abdomen as if two energies are intertwined, causing obstruction and discomfort, like smoke rising, with a feeling of heat in the head and face; or feelings of despair, madness, paralysis from stroke; or conditions like exhaustion, wind-dampness, or beriberi; or palpitations and anxiety beneath the heart, akin to fearing capture; or wheezing, coughing, and vomiting; or the vomiting of cold saliva, green water, or black water, which may indicate lung abscess, intestinal toxicity, or severe complications with pus and spasms.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>All internal and external diseases arise from phlegm. When fluids become thick and turn into phlegm and drinking, they surge upwards causing dryness of the mouth and throat. When they flow downwards, they block the flow of urine and feces, leading to a face that appears like dry bones and hair that is charred and dry. In women, this results in blocked menstruation, while in children, it can cause convulsions and seizures. The treatment should first focus on expelling the bad phlegm, then consider the condition&#39;s deficiency or excess to adjust the therapy. Therefore, the formulation of the &quot;Rolling Phlegm Pill&quot; is crucial for addressing phlegm and fluid issues in the three burn areas. It seems to me that many treatise are thorough, yet if they do not differentiate between deficiency and excess, and simply use harsh medicines, they might not truly address the core issue. There are differences in constitution; the severity of disease can vary. A misstep may lead to greater complications. Danxi said: Excessive use of draining medicines for phlegm can weaken the spleen&#39;s energy, causing phlegm to easily recur. He also stated that in cases where phlegm and food stagnation occur in the middle burner, the stomach qi needs nurturing; thus, it should not be recklessly attacked. If the attack is too severe, the condition may worsen and become more deficient. The &quot;Rolling Phlegm Pill&quot; should only be given to those with strong vital energy and substantial phlegm accumulation. It must not be used lightly on individuals with weak energy.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Essential Strategies for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ceasing Consumption to Resolve Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>There are six types of fluids: suspended, overflowing, obstructed, phlegmatic, retained, and latent. Phlegm-damp is merely one of these six types. When a person suffers from a condition referred to as phlegm-damp, it is generally due to prolonged stagnation, leading to the accumulation of phlegm, often caused by blockages in the airways resulting in the obstruction of bodily fluids. This can be likened to a blocked ditch where water accumulates and stagnates, causing backflow and leading to foul, corrupted smells.</p>
<p>If one does not open up the ditch but instead seeks to clear and purify the stagnant water, it is illogical. Conditions such as wheezing, coughing, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, palpitations, chills and fevers, painful swelling, distended epigastrium, or sounds of fluid in the chest and sides, or a sensation of coolness in the back and heart—all result from the dampness, reminiscent of the foul, corrupted water.</p>
<p>Therefore, a good treatment for phlegm involves focusing on the qi rather than directly addressing the phlegm. When qi is regulated, the bodily fluids will follow suit. It is advisable to use a combination of Suzi Jiangqi Decoction and Phlegm-Guide Decoction, both in equal parts. Alternatively, one may utilize Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction, adding Zhi Shi and Mu Xiang in equal weight, taken in five pill doses, or prepare a dosage of five pills brewed as a potion, which is especially effective.</p>
<p>In general, if there are no other issues and only a few phlegmatic symptoms, whether clear or viscous, it is recommended to use Er Chen Decoction or Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction. If phlegm is abundant, intermittently taking Qingzhou White Pills mixed with Lai Fudan is beneficial.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The divine remedy returns to the elixir, named Qing Shen Wan. This is not only for treating phlegm and fluids but is especially effective for alleviating coughs, vomiting, and counteracting reversed stomach energy. If the medicine does not work, use Er Sheng Tang with half a qian of Mu Xiang. If stubborn phlegm rises with the qi and is not resolved by the medicine, it should be addressed from below; it is advisable to use Wu Ge Kuan Zhong San with half a qian of Ban Xia, swallow the broken pills, and also take Ban Liu Wan. To prevent constipation and ensure complete relief from fluids, Ban Liu Wan should be taken regularly. If bowel movements naturally occur without medication, and for elderly or weak individuals, it is important to facilitate urination, using Xiao Ban Xia Fu Ling Tang, replacing with Chi Ling and doubling the amount; alternatively, use Dao Tan Tang with half a qian of Zhu Ling.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>For phlegm and fluids causing dizziness or inducing syncope, it is advisable to supplement with Shēng Táng with Mu Xiang, and swallow Qingzhou Baiwanzi mixed with Ling Sha Dan, called Qingjin Dan; alternatively, swallow Yangzheng Dan or Banliuhuan.</p>
<p>When phlegm and fluids flow into the limbs, causing soreness in the shoulders and back, along with weakness and numbness in the hands, if a doctor mistakenly diagnoses it as wind, that is incorrect. It is recommended to use Dao Tan Tang with half a coin of Mu Xiang and Jiang Huang.</p>
<p>If phlegm and fluids change into various symptoms, do not be misled by these symptoms and falsely name conditions. The treatment for phlegm should take precedence; once the phlegm is resolved, the symptoms will heal. In cases of sudden faintness, crookedness of the mouth and eyes, appearing as if it is a stroke but actually not, with limbs feeling heavy and the body feeling like a floating cloud—these are all caused by phlegm and fluids. Additionally, there may be kidney deficiency with cold preventing the retention of water, causing water evil to overflow upward and lead to phlegm and fluids; for this, Bawei Wan is suitable.</p>
<p>For those who have a history of phlegm and fluids causing pain in the shoulder and back, Xingxiang San should be used, or Dao Tan Tang followed by Wutaowan.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles</strong> [Ming - Lou Ying]</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>For anyone with phlegm, there will certainly be dark ash-black discoloration on the eyelids and under the eyes, easily observable without pulse diagnosis. Dark eyes and flushed cheeks indicate hot phlegm; a large yellow face also suggests hot phlegm. The external signs will surely include fullness and heat in the chest, a dry mouth with a longing for coolness, constipated stools, and red hot urine. Prolonged conditions may lead to wind, dizziness, tinnitus, and visual disturbances, with many signs of deficiency. When treating, the use of warming drugs is required; prolonged use will certainly lead to a large, strong pulse, can cause extreme heat and stroke, and should be addressed urgently. </p>
<p>If the eyes are dark and walking is labored with groans, this indicates phlegm that has entered the bones. Symptoms include pain throughout the body and joints. Dark eyes with a muddy complexion, weakness in the limbs, and difficulty in bending and stretching point to wind-damp phlegm. Dark eyes with shortness of breath signify phlegm due to shock. A large pulse on both sides of the radial artery indicates the presence of phlegm in the chest, which may be expelled; if the patient fears vomiting, use an enema instead. </p>
<p>For anyone with a cold sensation along the spine resembling a line, it is advisable to induce vomiting or use a purgative. If patients have ailments that are unresponsive to numerous medicines, and their pulse is hidden yet strong, it indicates phlegm; in this case, use the Miao Ying Pill. </p>
<p>Modification principles: for shock phlegm, add two qian of cinnabar and two whole scorpions, taking eight or nine pills regularly; for alcohol-associated phlegm, add two qian each of realgar and whole scorpion, taking ten pills each time; for hot phlegm, add equal parts of gypsum powder, taking three to six pills each time; for cold phlegm, add equal parts of pepper, cloves, scorpion, and cinnamon, taking twenty-five pills each time.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Phlegm as a disease can manifest as偏头风 (side head wind), 雷头风 (thunder head wind), or 太阳头痛 (sun headache). Symptoms include dizziness as if seated in a boat, a wandering spirit, twitching of the mouth and eyes, itchiness in the eyebrows, ears, and every part of the body; swelling and hardness in the jaw and limbs, resembling pain yet not quite so. The whole body feels dry and itchy, scratching brings forth itchy rashes, the skin feels hot like fire, with a color resembling brocade. The teeth and gums may feel itchy or painful, with pain shifting unpredictably. The mouth feels full of floating teeth, with pain and itchiness varying, belching sourness, smelling burnt, feeling a bean-like scent in the throat, causing annoyance and nasal obstruction, with difficulty swallowing or expelling, sometimes expelled by sneezing or salivating when in motion. The phlegm may appear like black ink, broken fluff, peach gum, or clam meat. </p>
<p>At times, the heart feels as if ice or iron is lodged inside, causing stagnation and oppression, leading to repeated belching and symptoms resembling phlegm in the diaphragm. Dreams may involve punishment and violence with swords, or being surrounded by walls in a house with difficulty escaping, not knowing the way out. Other dreams may entail flames with smoke surrounding, with the smell of burning bones and no clear path to exit. Sometimes, there may not be an external trigger, yet feelings of anger and sorrow arise, with tears raining down upon waking. </p>
<p>Occasionally, while wandering outdoors, one may see two moons shining together at the horizon or multiple beams of golden light, only to turn and find nothing. One may experience weakness in the knees and feet, pain in the bones, waist, and kidneys, difficulty in breathing, or pain between the body’s muscles and bones as if being struck, coming and going unpredictably. There may also be occasional numbness and pain in the arms, resembling rheumatism, restlessness while lying down, feeling pricked like with thorns, or heaviness in the limbs, with difficulty opening and closing the eyes as if stung by a wasp. </p>
<p>During changes in weather, chest tightness and blocked energy may cause toothaches and throat pain. When the mouth ulcerates and the tongue rots, sudden outbursts may bring forth repeated sneezing, initially producing thick, sticky mucus followed by clear, profuse fluid. One may see darkness before the eyes, hear wind behind the brain, and experience the buzzing of cicadas in the ears, with the eyes twitching uncontrollably due to the disarray.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Those who treat it do not say that the pores are not tight, and when the wind invades, they say the upper part is abundant and the lower part is empty, sometimes calling it cold vacuity or the onset of evil. Only the adept in treating this suffering can manage it. The onset of the illness feels as if there are two energies intertwining in the chest and abdomen, leading to choking and annoyance, like smoke and fire surging upward, causing the head and face to feel hot, with dizzy eyes and ringing ears. Phlegm, saliva, tears—all surge from the lungs and stomach, causing the hair to stand on end, leading to repeated sneezing, and then a restlessness throughout the body. One may shed their clothes and feel cold, which may provide temporary relief; during the coolness of spring or autumn, adding clothes and blankets may also temporarily alleviate it. Some may drink cold water suddenly, others may drink to excess, bringing temporary comfort, yet none can eradicate the root of the illness. </p>
<p>Thus, the secret recipe of aromatic pills has often shown great efficacy, curing tens of thousands, but it is not wished to be casually shared with others, so it is stated in veiled language. The poem says: &quot;In the steamer, one turns over in a golden belt, now wearing a hat deep in the grass hall. Meeting at eighteen, seeking the correct measurement, the refinement of salt makes the blue mist heavier than sinking. Among the seventeen taels, half a tael of the sinking, water and tablets of phoenix seeds must be measured.

<p>Phlegm is a term for a disease. When a person&#39;s qi and blood are clear and flowing, bodily fluids circulate properly, and there is no phlegm. However, when qi and blood become turbid and stagnant, bodily fluids do not clear, leading to their accumulation and transformation into phlegm. The root of phlegm is water, originating in the kidneys. The activity of phlegm is linked to dampness, primarily governed by the spleen. The ancients used Erchen Decoction as a general remedy for phlegm because it strengthens the spleen and dries dampness, thus treating the symptoms. It is indeed effective for damp phlegm, cold phlegm, phlegm fluids, and phlegm saliva. </p>
<p>If phlegm is caused by fire rising, causing the lung qi to become obstructed, leading to coughing during this time, and there is old, accumulated phlegm that forms into thick blocks, making it difficult to expel, this phlegm is all due to the fire evil rising, affecting the upper jiao, and obstructing the lung qi. Thus, the bodily fluids that follow the qi rise are steamed by fire, becoming turbid and stagnated. Over years, it becomes deeply rooted, hence called old phlegm or obstructed phlegm, and its essence is fire.</p>
<p>The illness resides in the upper jiao, particularly between the heart and lungs, and the throat, unlike the damp phlegm of the middle jiao&#39;s spleen and stomach, cold phlegm, phlegm fluids, or phlegm saliva, making it difficult to treat with decoctions. It cannot be cured with herbs like Pinellia, Poria, Atractylodes, Zhiqiao, and Nanjing. Instead, the focus should be on relieving obstruction, lowering fire, clearing and moistening the lung metal, and dissolving the accumulated phlegm to treat it gently and effectively.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The current prescription for phlegm-dissolving pills includes one tael each of Asparagus, Huangqin (Scutellaria), stir-fried with alcohol, Hai Fen (sea powder), and Tangerine peel; five qian each of crushed Platycodon, Forsythia, and Cyperus soaked and stir-fried in light saltwater; three qian each of ground Indigowood and Glauber&#39;s salt; and one tael of ground Trichosanthes fruit, all to be made into a fine powder. Add a small amount of honey and ginger juice, mix the herbs very well, and form pills the size of longan. Melt one pill in your mouth or chew it well, then swallow with clear broth; alternatively, make balls the size of millet and take five to sixty with light ginger soup.</p>
<p>[Note: The ingredients here have sweet, bitter, and salty qualities and are cold in nature, capable of softening hardness, relieving stagnation, dissolving phlegm, and reducing fire, but they might harm the stomach. It is suitable for those with excessive spleen deficiency, phlegm caused by stagnation and internal heat. However, for those with weak spleen and qi deficiency leading to phlegm, using this could cause fullness, acid regurgitation, abdominal swelling, and hindered urination, potentially leading to death.] </p>
<p>Old phlegm is often found in those who drink alcohol.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The ascending wine vapors create fire, causing both the lungs and stomach to be afflicted by heat, resulting in stagnation. Use Tian Maidong and Huangqin to drain lung fire; Haifen and Mangxiao are salty and help soften stagnation; Lou Ren moistens the lungs and clears phlegm, Xiangfu Mi alleviates stagnation and descends qi, Lianqiao opens stagnation and lowers fire, and Qingdai cools excess heat. Avoid using aromatic and drying agents.</p>
<p>[Note: If there are signs of poor appetite or chest discomfort, this indicates weakness of the central qi, and the main formula should be Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Once the central qi is strengthened, phlegm will naturally be resolved. If kidney qi is deficient and fluids cannot descend, leading to turbid phlegm, it is a true viscera syndrome, and the primary formula should be Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. Once kidney qi is robust and fluids are clarified, there will be no phlegm. Additionally, there may be cases of phlegm due to spleen and stomach deficiency, where the center’s qi is weak and unable to digest food, or due to excessive harshness leading to worse spleen qi, causing fluids to stagnate and form phlegm; in these cases, the focus should be on strengthening the spleen and stomach.]<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chan]</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm: New and Old Distinction</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm is formed from bodily fluids and blood, rising and falling with the Qi. When Qi and blood are harmonious, phlegm flows and does not accumulate; if there is internal or external injury, it can become blocked and cause problems. Fresh and light phlegm appears bluish-white, thin, and has a mild taste. Old and heavy phlegm is yellow, turbid, thick, sticky, and hard to expel, gradually becoming foul-tasting with sour, spicy, fishy, greasy, salty, and bitter notes. In the initial stages of phlegm symptoms, there may be headaches and fever, resembling an exterior pathogenic condition; if it persists, there could be tidal fevers at night, resembling internal injury from Yin fire. Additionally, if phlegm fluid causes pain in the limbs and joints, it resembles a wind condition. However, in cases of phlegm-induced chest fullness and reduced appetite, the skin color remains the same, and the pulse is slippery, irregular, and unstable, indicating a different condition.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>All Diseases Associated with Phlegm</p>
<p>People know that qi and blood can cause illness, but they are unaware that phlegm diseases are even more numerous. When phlegm originates in the spleen, it may lead to fatigue in the limbs, abdominal pain, swelling, and diarrhea, known as damp phlegm. If combined with food stagnation and blood stasis, it can form nodules and masses, called food phlegm. If it lingers in the stomach region, it may cause frequent vomiting and acid regurgitation, with an uneasy sensation rising, as well as heat in the head and face, referred to as hot phlegm. If it arises from drinking alcohol, it may result in dry heaving, belching, and pain in the sides, known as alcohol phlegm. When it originates in the lungs, it may cause a dry cough, paleness like withered bones, along with dryness in the throat and mouth, referred to as dry phlegm, which can develop into chronic phlegm or stagnant phlegm over time. Moreover, emotional disturbances can cause phlegm to obstruct the throat and diaphragm, leading to fullness in the chest and sides, known as qi phlegm. If it confuses the heart, it may lead to palpitations, madness, and strange dreams, referred to as heat phlegm. If it affects the liver, it may cause dizziness and headaches, shaking of the eyes, itching of the ears, pain in the sides, paralysis on one side, numbness, and odd symptoms, called wind phlegm. Accumulated in the kidneys, it may lead to soreness and weakness in the legs and knees, stiffness and pain in the lower back, coldness in the limbs, joint pain, known as cold phlegm, also referred to as deficient phlegm.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Generally, if the entire body feels habitually as if worms are crawling, or if there are nodules inside the body that are neither red nor swollen, or if there are nodules on the neck that resemble sores but are not, or if there is throat obstruction like a horse&#39;s bridle, or if there is a sensation as if two energies are entwined in the chest and abdomen, causing choking and discomfort, or if there is a constant cold pain in the back, or if there is cold pain beneath the heart, or if the limbs are swollen and hard, feeling like pain but not quite, or if there are intermittent sharp pains in the joints, or if one vomits cold saliva, green water, or black bile, or if there is pus in urine or stools, or if the circulation is blocked, leading to consumption, or if a woman experiences missed menstrual periods, or if a child has convulsions, one must first eliminate phlegm before regulating the body. Additionally, for injuries to the breastbone from fighting, where the pain is unbearable and blood dispersing medication has no effect, drinking one&#39;s own urine may lead to vomiting phlegm and instantly relieve the pain. This holds true for hundreds of diseases involving phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Colors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wind Phlegm:</strong> Caused by external wind pathogens, or dryness from the kidneys causing movement in wood, or internal wind and heat, appears blue and shiny. For wind deficiency, use San Sheng drink or Gu Long Hu Dan; for wind-heat, use Xiao Sheng Feng Tang, Sou Feng Hua Tan Wan, Si Shen Dan, or Zhu Li Gao.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Phlegm:</strong> Due to cold from environment or cool drinks, appears deep blue-black like ash, and is prone to spitting or wheezing. For mild cases, use Wu Ji San or Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San; for severe cases, use Wen Zhong Hua Tan Wan or Gu Ban Liu Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Damp Phlegm:</strong> Either from external dampness or stagnation of fluids. If the color is white and causes rapid breathing, use Qian Qian Tang; for heart pain, use Dan Ban Xia Wan or Shen Zhu Wan; for damp heat, which appears yellow, use Zhong He Wan or Qing Ge Cang Sha Wan; if the dampness is internal, use Qing Meng Shi Wan.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Fire Heat as Cause</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heat Phlegm:</strong> This is caused by rich foods building up heat, or externally caused erroneous warmth, resulting in yellow sputum, which may contain blood or appear purple. Use Qingqi Huatan Wan boiled to take, or Da Jin Hua Wan and Gun Tan Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Phlegm:</strong> This results from consuming thick foods and bedding, which steams the body&#39;s fluids, creating thick and turbid phlegm. Use Er Chen Tang with additions of Qinqin, Lian, and Shan Zhi, or suppressing pills and moistening pills.</p>
<p><strong>Stagnant Phlegm:</strong> This is prolonged fire phlegm trapped in the heart and lungs, leading to blockage in the chest and difficult expectoration. Avoid drying drugs like Nanshing and Banxia; it is best to open appetite, lower fire, clear metal, and nourish the lungs gently during treatment. Use Jie Zhai Huatan Wan, Xie Fu Qingjin Wan, Dan Bei Mu Wan, and Xia Tian Gao.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Phlegm:</strong> This arises from emotional stagnation, leading to difficulty in expectoration or swallowing. The phlegm resembles broken cotton or plum pits. Use Si Qi Tang. For prolonged cases, omit Su Zi, and use Huang Qin, Shan Zhi, or Hai Shi. Use San Xian Wan and Qian Jin Zhi Mi Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and Alcohol as Cause</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diet Phlegm:</strong> This occurs from undigested food, resulting in blockages. Use Ju Ban Zhi Shu Wan. For sputum causing wheezing and urgency, use Lou Shi Wan or Shan Zha Mai Ya Tang. For those with Yin deficiency, use Huang Bai Wan. If there is a hard feeling in the heart cavity like a cup, this is named Qi Fen; use Zhi Zhu Wan boiled to take. If phlegm is as hard as a cup, with occasional water sounds, use Shen Bao Wan. For wine phlegm, use Xiao Diao Zhong Tang and Xiang Fu Lou Qing Dai Wan.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Phlegm and fluids have five types.</p>
<p>Phlegm accumulates in the channels, coming out through the lungs as a cough; saliva accumulates in the spleen, flowing from the corners of the mouth; fluid arises in the stomach, being expelled from the epigastrium. The five types of fluids and six symptoms, together with retained fluids and hidden fluids, form a single entity. All of this is due to the retention of water and tea or wine, combined with external pathogens causing cold, and emotions clashing to produce phlegm. In cases where phlegm from alcohol persists and dampness prevails, it closely resembles the water condition in severe cold, with a pulse often being wiry and slippery or hidden, and the skin under the eyes appearing dark and ashen.</p>
<p>Phlegm and fluids cause stagnation in the intestines and stomach, leading to rumbling sounds in the abdomen, resulting in dramatic weight gain or loss; suspended fluids cause water to flow in the flanks, resulting in pain when coughing or spitting; overflowing fluids cause water to flow into the limbs, resulting in heavy body pain; stagnant fluids cause water to accumulate above the diaphragm (in cases of food inability), leading to shortness of breath; retained fluids cause water to stagnate below the heart, resulting in a chilling sensation like a cold hand, possible shortness of breath and thirst, and joint pains in the limbs. Pain in the flanks radiates to the back, and coughing increases; hidden fluids cause water to stagnate and fullness of the diaphragm, leading to vomiting, coughing, fever with chills, back pain, tearing, or shivering. </p>
<p>Zhongjing treats various fluids under the skin and in the channels with the Xiao Qinglong Decoction; those in the chest and diaphragm are treated with Guadi Powder; those in the limbs and channels are treated with Wuling Powder; and those in the intestines and stomach are treated with Shizao Decoction.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>This is all a method of treating the symptoms superficially. For mild cases, use a decoction with Shensu and sweat it out, or vomit using Erchen Decoction with added Fangfeng and Jiegeng. For more serious blockages, apply Wuyin Decoction or the Jiezhuh Wan. In between, alternate with Xiaobansha Decoction, Gutingli Powder, Jiezhuh Wan, Wen Zhong Huatan Wan, Qingqi Huatan Wan, and Banxia Wenfei Decoction, adjusting according to deficiency or excess without being overly fixed.</p>
<p>The ancient method prioritizes guiding Qi first and then dispersing. When Qi rises it belongs to fire; phlegm that moves due to Qi is called phlegm-Qi, treated with the Shunqi Daotan Decoction. If it’s due to fire, it’s called phlegm-fire, thus treated by the Qingtian Daotan Decoction. If due to dampness, it&#39;s termed damp-phlegm, for which we use Qushi Daotan Decoction. The universally applied Erchen Decoction can facilitate stool and prolong urination, especially vital for guidance and dispersion.</p>
<p>When wind is involved, add Nanshen, Zaoji, BaiFuzhu, and Zhuli; for cold-related issues, use Banxia with ginger, Fuzhu, and ginger juice; for fire-induced conditions, include Shigao and Qingtai; damp conditions call for Cangzhu and Baizhu; dryness needs (Cao&#39;s) Lou and Xingren; chronic phlegm requires Haishi, Mangxiao, and (Cao&#39;s) Lou; food stagnation adds ShanZha, Shenqu, and MaiYa; water retention incorporates Binglang; phlegm located below the ribs uses Baijiezi for movement; phlegm in the limbs utilizes Zhuli; for phlegm in the meridians utilize this probing method; and for phlegm in the skin or outer membranes, combine Baijiezi, Zhuli, and ginger juice; in cases of strong Qi, use Jingli.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm originates in the kidneys, moves in the spleen, and lodges in the lungs. With the rise and fall of water and fire, and the harmony of the spleen and stomach, from where does phlegm emerge? If yang is deficient and the kidneys are cold, they cannot restrain the pathological water, leading to the overflow of cold phlegm, which may cause cough and wheezing at night. For this, Bawei Pill, Sanwei Anshen Pill, or Heixi Dan can be used to settle the condition. If phlegm accumulation leads to counterflow, Suzi Jiangqi Decoction, Sansheng Drink, or Gu Liu Gong Dan should be employed. If the spleen is deficient and unable to transform, it is advisable to tonify and dry dampness with Liujunzi Decoction, adding Zhuli and ginger juice. If overexertion damages the spleen’s ability to rise and descend, then Buzhong Yiqi Decoction should be used, with additions of Banxia, Zhuli, and ginger juice.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>When there is deficiency of qi and blood, phlegm obstructing the central gave, and blocking the clear pathways, it is advisable to warm the middle and dry the spleen with Er Chen Tang; if there is qi deficiency, combine with Si Jun Zi Tang; if there is blood deficiency, combine with Si Wu Tang; if there is yin deficiency with kidney fire rising and lung dryness, combine Er Chen Tang with Si Wu Tang, removing Chuan Xiong and Ban Xia, and adding Bei Mu, Mai Men Dong, (Herb) Lou Ren, and Jie Geng to moisten and reduce it. Alternatively, use Shen Qi Wan or San Yi Shen Qi Wan. It is said: phlegm has no nourishment method. Moreover, chronic phlegm is congealed and sticky; it cannot be resolved without temporarily using warming herbs to guide it, otherwise there will be a risk of obstruction. When wind and cold phlegm and qi are internally constrained, not using warming dispersants, how can one open up the stagnation? These issues cannot be strictly confined to a lack of nourishment. Generally, when phlegm causes wheezing with a loud voice, pulse is scattered, and sweat is profuse like oil, the body feels cold, it can lead to death. </p>
<p>Phlegm is the transformation of bodily fluids; wind injures the lungs, and dampness injures the spleen, congealing and becoming turbid. Externally, symptoms manifest as discomfort in the head and neck, resembling cold and heat causing a febrile disease. Initially, there is fullness and oppression in the chest, qi rushes up to the throat, with a floating pulse indicating abnormality. If there is heat, use Shen Su Yin, Jin Fei Cao San, or Chai Hu Ban Xia Tang; if there is no heat, use Er Chen Tang or Wen Dan Tang. Phlegm-dispelling decoction can be used broadly. For phlegm obstructing the chest, use He Ding Dan or Zhi Ju Er Chen Tang; if phlegm rises and attacks the upper without corresponding headaches, use Gua Di San to expel it.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>Thick and turbid substances are phlegm, while clear and thin ones are fluids. In discussing phlegm diseases, six or seven out of ten cases arise, and the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; describes four categories of phlegm and fluid, all due to the harm caused by damp earth. Thus, the sages say: the spleen is the source of phlegm, and also state: treating phlegm without addressing the spleen and stomach is not proper treatment. When fluids enter the stomach, they flow out nourishing energy, which ascends to the spleen. The spleen&#39;s energy disperses this essence, which returns to the lungs, regulating the water pathways and then descending to the bladder. The essence of water distributes evenly, and the five meridians function seamlessly; how can there be phlegm? Only when the spleen&#39;s earth is deficient and damp, does the clear fail to rise and the turbid fail to descend, becoming trapped and stagnant, thus forming phlegm. Therefore, to treat phlegm, one must first tonify the spleen; when the spleen regains its regular function, phlegm will naturally resolve. In summary, phlegm can be categorized into five types, and fluids also have five types, with treatment methods varying accordingly.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In the spleen channel, this is called damp phlegm; the pulse is slow and the face is yellow, with heavy limbs. One has a desire to sleep but cannot be refreshed, abdominal distention and food stagnation occur, and the phlegm is slippery and easily expelled. Prescription: Er Chen Tang, Bai Zhu Wan. If accompanied by deficiency, use Liu Jun Zi Tang; if caused by alcohol injury, use Bai Dou Kou and Gan Ge; if associated with food, use Bao He Wan; if associated with summer heat, use Xiao Shu Wan; if related to fright, use Miao Ying Wan.</p>
<p>In the lung channel, this is called dry phlegm, also known as qi phlegm; the pulse is thin and the face is pale, with breathlessness and difficulty inhaling, alternating chills and fever, feelings of sorrow and unhappiness; the phlegm is thick and difficult to expel. Prescription: Li Jin Tang, Run Fei Yin.</p>
<p>In the liver channel, this is called wind phlegm; the pulse is wiry and the face is blue, with fullness and heaviness in the limbs, secretive and difficult urination, and occasional irritability. The phlegm is bluish and bubbly. Prescription: Shui Zhu Jin Hua Wan, Fang Feng Wan, Chuan Xiong Wan.</p>
<p>In the heart channel, this is called heat phlegm; the pulse is surging and the face is red, with feelings of annoyance, heat, and heart pain, dry mouth and chapped lips, often showing signs of laughter. The phlegm is hard and formed into lumps. Prescription: Xiao Huang Wan, Tian Huang Tang.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>In the kidney channel, it is called cold phlegm. The pulse is deep, the face is dark, and there is urgency and pain in urination, with cold feet and reversed flow. The heart is filled with fear, and the phlegm is thin with black spots. Treat with ginger and cinnamon pill, eight treasures pill, or pepper remedy. This person was once robust but is now thin; water runs in the intestines making a rumbling sound, known as phlegm-fluid, with extreme coldness below the heart. Warm herbs are used to harmonize it, and the Gui Ling Gan Zhu soup is the main remedy. If water flows beneath the ribs after drinking, with coughing and painful sputum, it is called suspended fluid, to be treated with the Ten Jujube soup. If water flows to the limbs, with a sensation of sweat not being released and a heavy pain in the body, it is called overflow fluid, to be treated with the Major Qinglong soup. If there is reversed coughing while resting, shortness of breath making it hard to lie down, and the body appears swollen, it is called support fluid, treated with the Wuling powder or Ze Xie soup. If there is fullness in the diaphragm with vomiting, wheezing, coughing, chills and fever, back pain, watery eyes, and the person shivers with cold, feeling tense, it is called lurking fluid, treated with the double Atractylodes pill.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>There is also a type that is neither phlegm nor fluid, which sometimes produces white foam that is not very thick or sticky. This is due to the spleen being weak and unable to control the fluids, leading to the spontaneous production of saliva and foam. It is advisable to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with the addition of Galangal seeds to restrain it. Alas! The five types of phlegm and five types of fluids are all different, and their treatments are entirely distinct. If one does not understand this clearly and recklessly administers medications, it is not only ineffective but may also cause harm. Particularly, the phlegm from the spleen and lungs must not be mixed. The spleen is associated with damp earth, favoring warmth and dryness while disliking coldness and moisture, thus the two Atractylodes (zhuzhu) and Poria are essential medicines. The lung, being associated with dry metal, prefers coolness and moisture while disliking warmth and dryness, so the two Mothers (Ophiopogon) and the herbs of the two winters, Rehmannia, and Platycodon are key medicines. The treatment for them is relatively easy and rarely leads to complications. In common practice, people dislike the drying effect of Pinellia and prefer the moistening effect of Fritillaria, immediately using Fritillaria upon seeing phlegm. However, if it is spleen phlegm, the earth aspect is further damaged, and food intake suddenly declines; even if it is lung phlegm, one should not use too much cooling moisture as it could hurt the middle qi. One should slightly employ spleen herbs to nourish lung metal for effective treatment. Thus, it is said that treating phlegm without addressing the spleen and stomach is not the correct approach.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>Wang Jiezhai says: The origin of phlegm is water, stemming from the kidneys. The movement of phlegm is due to dampness, which is under the control of the spleen. In ancient times, the Er Chen Decoction was commonly used to treat phlegm, specifically for damp phlegm and cold phlegm. However, when the yin fire rises and affects the upper burner, obstructing the lung qi, the fluids that rise with the qi condense into phlegm, which becomes thick, foul, and in severe cases, can even be blood-streaked. This is not comparable to the damp phlegm and cold phlegm of the middle burner, nor can it be treated with Banxia, Zhike, or Nansheng. Only by using clear qi to transform phlegm can there be effective results. Alas! Jiezhai discusses phlegm, and initially identifies its fundamental source in the kidneys, which can be considered an insight not previously uncovered. Unfortunately, while he touches upon the topic, he does not complete the discussion. The remedies he proposes are primarily for symptomatic treatment, and among them, there are many cooling substances that often cause harm to the stomach.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>Zhongjing said: When there is deficient qi with phlegm, use Shenqi pill to tonify and expel it. Wu Jiaoshan in &quot;Differentiating Various Conditions&quot; also stated: The Eight-Treasure pill addresses the root of phlegm. These two scholars truly enlighten later learners who suffer silently, alleviating countless ailments. Phlegm is a term for illness and is not an inherent part of the human body; it is not simply water turned into phlegm nor water boiling into phlegm; rather, it must differentiate between the presence of fire and the absence of water.</p>
<p>When kidney deficiency cannot control water, it fails to return to its source, leading to water flowing backward, and a flood-like situation results in phlegm—this is the absence of fire. Hence, the Eight-Treasure pill is used to tonify kidney fire. When yin is deficient and fire is active, water boils over; if it is moving in the kidneys, it is like dragon fire emerging from the sea—where the dragon rises, water follows; if it is stirring in the liver, it is akin to thunderfire erupting from the earth, causing strong winds and torrential rains; water surges and turns into phlegm—this is phlegm with fire. Thus, the Six-Treasure pill is utilized to complement the fire.</p>
<p>This does not target the symptoms of phlegm but addresses its root cause. However, how can one differentiate between phlegm with and without fire? It is said: Without fire, it is simply clear water; with fire, it contains heavy and turbid white froth. Those who are good at using these methods can first apply the Six-Treasure and Eight-Treasure pills to strengthen the source of water and benefit the original fire; then they can use the Four Gentlemen or Six Gentlemen formulas to tonify the spleen to control water.</p>
<p>For spleen deficiency, not only is the middle strengthened, but the Six-Treasure and Eight-Treasure pills can also control water and nourish the mother. The mutual generation and overcoming between mother and child suggest that we can approach the treatment of phlegm effectively.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Pang An often said: When there is insufficient yin fluid and the fire of yin rises, the lungs suffer from the heat and cannot properly descend and clear. Consequently, the fluids become thickened and turbid, resulting in phlegm without producing blood. One should use moistening agents, such as Ophiopogon, Rehmannia, and Goji berries, to nourish the yin, allowing the rising fire to return to its dwelling and rest, thereby clearing the phlegm on its own. If two treasures are applied, one will quickly see its effectiveness. </p>
<p>In cases of kidney deficiency unable to gather qi, the qi flows out without being retained, leading to accumulation; if this accumulation does not disperse, phlegm will arise, and the Eight Herb Pill addresses this. The &quot;Mengquan&quot; states: Rehmannia mud can create phlegm, making it a restricted medicine, which should be stir-fried with ginger juice. Alas! If stir-fried with ginger juice, it becomes spicy and dry, rendering the Rehmannia ineffective. Rehmannia is primarily valued for its moistening properties and its ability to enter the kidney channel. If mixed with spleen and stomach medicines, which dislike dampness, how can it not create phlegm? The various ingredients in the Eight Herb and Six Herb Pills are all medicines of the lesser yin channel, working together to directly reach the lower jiao; hence they are known as the sacred medicine for phlegm generated by water. It should be taken on an empty stomach, followed by a nutritious meal, without lingering in the stomach. This is the wonderful principle of formulations established by Zhang Zhongjing, so why must we remain doubtful?<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>On Phlegm and Fluid Disorders</strong> </p>
<p>Phlegm and fluid disorders are a major concern, affecting seven or eight people out of every ten. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; texts elaborate on this matter in great detail, categorizing and naming the different types. Later generations, overwhelmed by the multitude of names, often lose sight of their fundamental essence, failing to consider that the sages established laws from a single source without divergence. </p>
<p>The stomach serves as the sea for food and water, and is the main source for the five organs and six bowels. Sustenance enters the stomach, where it nourishes and energizes the body, ascending to the spleen. The spleen then disseminates the energy and returns it to the lungs, regulating the pathways of water before ultimately descending to the bladder. The essence of water disperses throughout the body, and the five meridians operate harmoniously, which is the norm for healthy individuals. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; speaks of the disorders arising when the essence of water does not disperse properly, and the five meridians do not operate in unison. </p>
<p>Water is the most precious element in the human body. Heaven gives rise to water, which circulates everywhere without exception. If there is stagnation, it is like the low-lying parts of rivers where refuse accumulates, the waterways become narrow, and overflow occurs, which cannot be avoided. One must follow the natural tendencies and guide the flow, from high mountains to plains, and from plains to oceans, in order to avoid flooding.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Therefore, Zhongjing distinguishes between the shallow and deep to teach people, naming them to seek their meanings. The shallow pertains to within the body but outside the organs, and it has four names: phlegm flu, suspended fluid, overflowing fluid, and constrained fluid. Phlegm flu is when water moves in the intestines, making a dripping sound; suspended fluid is when water flows under the ribs, causing pain when coughing or expectorating; overflowing fluid is when water flows in the limbs, preventing sweating and resulting in a heavy feeling in the body; constrained fluid is when one coughs, has difficulty breathing, and presents a swollen appearance. </p>
<p>One type flows from the stomach down to the intestines, another flows from the stomach out to the sides, another flows out to the limbs, and another ascends from the stomach into the chest and diaphragm. Initially, one does not notice it; as days and months accumulate, the essence of water turns turbid, eventually forming phlegm flu. It first gathers in the places difficult for breath to access, thus flowing from the intestines to the sides and limbs, gradually saturating the chest and diaphragm, with its effects becoming more pronounced. The problem of phlegm flu has invariably originated from the stomach. The deeper issues ascend from the stomach into the Yang regions, gradually affecting the heart and lungs; from the stomach descending into the Yin regions, gradually affecting the spleen, liver, and kidneys.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>Thus, when water resides in the heart, it strengthens the spirit below, creating shortness of breath; one does not wish to drink this bad water. When water attacks from the outside, fire diminishes, causing the water to become firmer. When fire is blocked internally, the breath constricts, leading to this shortness of breath. Fire and water are enemies, hence one does not drink it.</p>
<p>When water is in the lungs, it produces spittle and foam, creating a desire to drink water. This is because the lungs govern qi, circulate nourishment, and distribute fluids. When water evil enters, it obstructs the qi pathways, causing the qi to condense and fluids to gather, transforming into spittle and foam, losing its clarity; thus, one resorts to drinking water for relief.</p>
<p>When water is in the spleen, there is a lack of qi, and the body feels heavy, as the spleen dislikes dampness. If dampness prevails, vitality diminishes, and the body feels heavy.</p>
<p>When water is in the liver, there is fullness beneath the ribs, causing sneezing and pain, as the liver is related to the gallbladder, with their meridians running alongside the ribs. When the fire qi surges to the nose, it causes sneezing, and tension in the ribs results in pain.</p>
<p>When water is in the kidneys, there is a palpitation below the heart, as kidney water overwhelms the heart, creating discomfort. It is not merely a pit of neighborly drink.</p>
<p>The five organs are where the spirit resides. When water accumulates, it manifests as phlegm and fluids, enveloping from the outside. The poetry mentions waves shaking the city of Yueyang, which vividly reflects the situation; is this not a major ailment of the human body? However, this merely depends on its location, clarifying the names and positioning, aiming for proper treatment without deviation.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Ultimately, the areas where water accumulates are called &quot;retained drinks,&quot; as they remain and do not leave. When retained drinks are present but do not exhaust completely, they are called &quot;hidden drinks,&quot; as they hide and do not emerge. Following the various phlegm and drinks that are either retained or hidden, and treating them according to their nature, is the essence of proper method. Let me explain it further.</p>
<p>From the stomach upward through the divisions of the chest, diaphragm, heart, and lungs, one should drive those retained drinks back to the stomach and eliminate them, either through the intestines below or vomiting above. Such expulsions are direct and satisfying, and do not lead to hiding. This is known by all. If the drinks exit through the skin, the clear ones may surface as sweat, while the turbid cannot escape and must inevitably return to the chest and diaphragm. From the chest and diaphragm, they should return to the stomach before they can enter the intestines and be expelled. Driving them out must involve hidden drinks within the skin that resist expulsion. </p>
<p>If they are deeply stored in the back, which serves as a cavity for the chest, there is even less opportunity for escape, and they must return to the chest and diaphragm before they can proceed to the stomach and intestines for proper downward movement. It is not only that they resist expulsion, but there is also the dangerous excessive yang heat implicated, which can lead to sores and poisons that accumulate like an orange pouch. </p>
<p>The difficulty in expelling hidden drinks can easily lead to harm; who can discern and resolve this? I, Chang, apply calm reasoning and speak on medical practice, with firm evidence, carefully based on the secret text of the &quot;Golden Coffer,&quot; directly imparting the golden needle technique, urging the heirs of medical practitioners to refine their understanding and further pursue precision in their craft.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on the Pulse of Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of phlegm and fluid, as mentioned in the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; varies inconsistently, making it difficult to interpret comprehensively. In my humble opinion, there are also differences in depth and severity, which can be clarified. The section on important pulse subtleties states: the liver pulse is soft and scattered; in terms of color, it indicates the presence of excessive fluid. Excessive fluid refers to extreme thirst and frequent drinking, which easily enters the muscles, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. This specifically highlights the condition of excessive drinking as the most superficial manifestation of drinking-related illness. Zhang Jing understood this concept and categorized the symptoms of fluid retention into four types, summarizing them as: phlegm fluid, suspended fluid, overflowing fluid, and restrained fluid, generally discussed from shallow to deep in treatment. Failing to address this and allowing it to escalate into a flood of accumulated fluids means that these four types cannot be discussed in the same manner. The pulse of fluid that is not taut, but merely indicates pain and shortness of breath, refers to the true pulse of fluid. If the fluid pulse is not taut, this suggests that the accumulation of water is not significant; however, it still harms the yang energy, leading only to mild shortness of breath.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>It is said that when there is edema, the patient may wheeze and be unable to lie down, experiencing shortness of breath. When the pulse is still steady, and one observes the edema rising to the chest and diaphragm, accompanied by wheezing and shortness of breath, with a pulse that remains steady, it may seem present yet is nearly absent, showing only a slight accumulation, not yet settled deeply, hence not evident in the pulse. It is said that if the pulse is floating, thin, and slippery, it indicates injury from fluid intake; this floating, thin, and slippery pulse is not similar to that from wind-cold, but rather is due to the initial stagnation of fluid, which has not penetrated deeply yet. At this time, the physician should urgently consider the dangers of stagnation and promptly activate the body&#39;s own elimination, employing strategies according to the circumstances, which would resolve the issue. Otherwise, if the condition deepens and the final portion of the illness separates more, the root becomes increasingly difficult to diagnose. Year after year, if one merely inspects formulas and seeks remedies without success, can success be achieved? Therefore, whenever one observes the pulse turning deep and string-like, one should apply appropriate methods to investigate. When it is said that the pulse is deep, it indicates the presence of retained fluid in the chest, leading to shortness of breath and thirst. This results in pain in the limbs and joints, indicating that the lung&#39;s ability to regulate is not functioning, and the vital energy is not dispersing, hence the shortness of breath; without the dispersal of energy, the fluids do not transform, resulting in dry phlegm and thirst; if the spleen&#39;s energy is not moving, the fluid accumulates in the joints, causing pain.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>This evidence suggests that there is a mutual disease between the lungs and spleen. The so-called fluids entering the stomach and spreading their essence upward to the spleen, dispersing the spleen&#39;s energy and ascending to the lungs, is a common occurrence. If one then resorts to hiring soldiers and stealing grain to seek peace, can such tranquility be obtained? Concerning the pulse characteristics: it is said that a cough corresponds to a string-like pulse, indicating the presence of fluids; a double string-like pulse denotes cold, often resulting from a significant depletion after a purge; a pulse that is slightly string-like indicates fluid retention, leading to wheezing and fullness; a rapid string-like pulse indicates cold fluids, which are hard to treat in winter and summer; a deep and string-like pulse suggests hanging fluids causing internal pain. This describes the accumulation of water, addressing the urgent fluid retention and broadening the explanation. Aside from significant purges, a double string-like pulse indicates a difference between deficiency and cold, while a slightly string-like pulse indicates fluid retention. The difficulty in treatment during winter and summer stems from the use of cold methods for cold conditions and hot methods for heat conditions, making spring and autumn far more conducive to treatment. The internal pain from hanging fluids refers to a substantial accumulation of such fluids, leading to pain in severe cases.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>There is also a deep and tight pulse, indicating a firm mass beneath the heart and a dark complexion, signifying water accompanied by kidney cold, mixed in the heart and lungs. This leads to a firm sensation below the heart and a dark complexion. If the pulse is hidden, it is a sign of retained fluids, where accumulated fluids hold the pulse and do not reveal themselves, being even more pronounced than a thin pulse. Moreover, when the pulse is hidden yet smooth, it indicates that the retained fluid wants to disperse. If there has been a persistent cough for several years, a weak pulse can be treated, but a strong and full pulse signifies death; a weak pulse will inevitably suffer from phantasms because there is already retained fluid in the chest. All these indicate that the disease is deep and the pulse has changed, requiring one to trace its flow and investigate its source thoroughly. When the heavenly pivot opens and the stomach is harmonized, the pulse is smooth. However, if phlegm and fluids are condensed within, the mechanisms of opening and closing are not functioning properly, and the pulse transforms into deep, taut, rapid, biased, numerous, or tense forms, or may even be hidden and unseen. Without urgently removing the phlegm and fluids, how can the pulse return to its normal state? Those with shallow conditions can be treated lightly; those with deep conditions require deep treatment, and those between shallow and deep should be treated accordingly. Retained fluids can be attacked, hidden ones can be guided, and firm ones can be dispersed. If one continues to follow past practices, the disease deepens with no energy, leading to sudden distress; at that point, it is beyond the reach of medicine.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Retained Phlegm and Fluids</strong></p>
<p>The conditions of retained phlegm and fluids have two meanings that are particularly difficult to understand. To discuss retained fluids refers to those that remain and do not disperse, while hidden fluids are those that remain concealed within. Retained fluids can eventually leave, while hidden fluids will never depart; thus, the meanings of retention and concealment begin to become clearer. The profound meaning of the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; cannot be fully expressed in mere words, and so I will explain it again. In the &quot;Golden Coffer,&quot; there are three observations on retained fluids and one on hidden fluids. It states: when there is retained fluid below the heart, the person feels cold in the back, as if the size of a palm. Secondly: retained fluid causes pain in the side and pulls toward the lower abdomen. Thirdly: when there is retained fluid in the chest, the person experiences shortness of breath and thirst, with pain in the joints of the limbs. Speaking of retained fluid in the chest, it obstructs and represses the yang of the upper jiao, namely the heart and lungs, leading to a yin stagnation. Thus, for those with deep cold in the back, there is only cold without heat, which obstructs the upward movement of the governing vessel&#39;s yang, resulting in cold in the back like the size of a palm, all of which is merely a manifestation of internal stagnation of the yang fire.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The channels of the hand-foot Jueyin run below the ribs, and the channel of the foot Shaoyang passes through the diaphragm and the lateral ribs. Therefore, pain in the side is linked to the diaphragm and is a sign of retained phlegm obstructing the movement of wood and fire. When phlegm is retained in the chest, it causes shortness of breath and thirst, while the limbs ache at the joints, indicating a failure of the lungs to circulate qi and of the spleen to disperse essence. When viewed altogether, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and phlegm are all capable of retention and burdening one another—this meaning does not change.</p>
<p>As for the retained phlegm, it manifests as phlegm in the upper diaphragm, fullness with dyspnea, coughing, and expectoration. It may lead to alternating chills and fever, back pain, waist pain, and tears streaming from the eyes. The afflicted person often shows signs of tremors and severe twitching; there must be retained phlegm present.</p>
<p>The heart and lungs govern the chest, and when phlegm retention obstructs the yang qi, it cannot be mobilized. Nonetheless, heavy yin is ultimately difficult to conceal; sometimes the yang extends, with no accommodation for yin, leading to sudden vomiting or expulsion, allowing the retained phlegm to emerge. If further withholding occurs without expulsion, it indicates that the three yang energies are extending and retracting again.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>When the sunlight does not extend, it causes cold and heat, back pain, and tears in the eyes. When the lesser yang does not extend, the transformation of wind and fire becomes constrained and blends within the broad yang of the earth. The broad yang governs the muscles, leading to trembling of the body and intense suffering. If the retained fluids do not disperse, the burden becomes even greater. However, for the treatment of retained fluids, Zhongjing does not mention a method. If one seeks to control the excessive yang of the four organs and three cavities, then using warming herbs to harmonize should address this condition, shouldn’t it? The Decoction of Poria, Cinnamon, Atractylodes, and Licorice is meant to treat fullness in the chest and dizziness; does this not align with the understanding of this condition and can it not be applied accordingly? Therefore, one must thoroughly understand the ratio before one can discuss the therapeutic methods.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Later generations do not understand the principles of the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; and arbitrarily create theories of the five types of fluid accumulation and six signs. They, with a shallow understanding, apply the teachings regarding fluid accumulation, stating: first, heart retention; second, side retention; third, phlegm retention in the stomach; fourth, overflow retention above the diaphragm; fifth, hanging retention in the intestines. They propose a unified treatment for all, how superficial this is!</p>
<p>Note that phlegm retention is fundamentally one condition, but there are two causes. Phlegm arises from fire, characterized by heat without cold; fluid retention, on the other hand, is due to dampness, characterized by both heat and cold, maintaining that there are warm springs without cold fire. When the body is heated and agitated internally, the qi and blood stagnate, causing the essential fluids to steam and congeal into phlegm, an expression of fire.</p>
<p>Water comes from dampness, lingering and unconsumed, accumulating into fluid retention. Ultimately, cases of fluid retention primarily arise from the combination of heat and dampness, with fewer cases resulting from cold and dampness. Dampness lacks a fixed form; in spring it is termed wind-damp, in summer hot-damp, in autumn dry-damp, and in winter cold-damp. Three seasons are dominated by heat, while one season is dominated by cold, with heat-damp conditions occurring three times more frequently than cold-damp.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; when dampness and earth excessively dominate, phlegm retention can become a disease, treated with various heat remedies, not implying that phlegm retention is cold in nature. Later generations do not understand this and recklessly use heat medications as a pretext. What they fail to realize is that to treat the six external pathogens, one must first resolve external disturbances. Thus, to address the dominance of dampness, it is also necessary to warm the exterior to disperse its pathological influences, and when attacking internally, it will not stray far from cold either.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>Moreover, at the beginning, there can be no outward expression, and the accumulation of yin blocks the yang within the body, it is necessary to employ warmth to promote the yang for the yin pathogens to swiftly depart. If one merely relies on common methods blindly, would that not be foolish! </p>
<p>&quot;The Lesser Learning&quot; discusses the method of differentiating between deficiency and excess, stating that the origin of illness is due to external influences and internal damage, leading to the generation of fire, dampness, damp-heat, and phlegm—these are the only four causes. </p>
<p>When assessing recent illnesses in the young, if it is dampness, we should dry it; if it is fire, we should purge it. If dampness generates heat, we should dry the dampness while simultaneously clearing heat. If fire produces phlegm, we should drain the fire while also dispersing the phlegm, ensuring no residue remains. </p>
<p>In examining the elderly or those with chronic illnesses, one should apply both attacking and tonifying methods. For instance, if there is qi deficiency with damp-heat phlegm-fire, one would use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to tonify qi while simultaneously drying dampness, clearing heat, dispersing phlegm, and draining fire; if there is blood deficiency with phlegm-fire damp-heat, one would use the Four-substances Decoction to tonify blood while also draining fire, dispersing phlegm, clearing heat, and drying dampness. </p>
<p>In this way, a combination of attacking and tonifying methods is appropriate and should be feasible.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Thus it is said: In the young and robust, new ailments should be examined by attacking the pathogenic factors; in the old and frail, nourishing and tonifying remedies should take precedence. As for the deficiency of Yin leading to excessive fire, and the weakness of the spleen and stomach, the true Yin is akin to water, while the spleen and stomach correspond to earth. Though earth prefers dryness, excessive heat will cause plants to wither. Likewise, though wood thrives in moisture, too much humidity leads to rot. Therefore, when using remedies to tonify the spleen and nourish the kidneys, it is essential to balance dryness and dampness, adjusting them according to varying conditions.</p>
<p>Later generations treat phlegm and fluid retention with four methods: strengthening the spleen, drying dampness, reducing fire, and promoting Qi circulation. To strengthen the spleen and dry dampness, the formulas of Er Chen and Er Zhur are most suitable, though they should be avoided if there&#39;s Yin deficiency. For reducing fire, it is necessary to differentiate between deficiency and excess; bitter-cold herbs are used for excess, while sweet-cold is applied for deficiency. </p>
<p>As for Qi-moving herbs, one must avoid random selection without principle. The cold and wind pathogens invade from the outside and envelop the phlegm and fluids; using Xiao Qing Long Tang can disperse the evil externally while expelling phlegm and fluids downward. The turbid Yang Qi enters from below and entraps the phlegm and fluids; employing Fu Ling Hou Po Tang will allow the turbid Qi to descend and the phlegm and fluids to rise.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>Excessive anger causes liver qi to rise, and the blood follows suit; qi and blood, along with phlegm and fluids, intertwine and form obstructions. Use Chai Hu Bie Jia San to expel them. Excessive worry causes spleen qi to become stagnant, leading to poor digestion; qi, food, and phlegm also intermingle and create obstructions. Use Qing Tan Wan to eliminate them. Excessive desire causes kidney qi to rise, penetrating the membranes and creating numerous blockages, resulting in a feeling of heaviness and a tendency to sag; one cannot bear to look up. Use Gui Ling Wan to guide the qi downward, clearing phlegm and fluids. </p>
<p>Cold phlegm and fluids in the body are seen in a few cases among the young but are common in the elderly and children. If there is coldness in the spleen and stomach, loss of appetite, and blockage of yin qi causing vomiting of saliva, warming the interior is advisable. If there is true yang deficiency, one must further nourish the lower body, avoiding clearing medications. </p>
<p>For children with chronic spleen phlegm, phlegm obstructs the passages; use Xing Fu Liu Jun Tang to awaken them. </p>
<p>For the elderly with kidney deficiency leading to water rising and phlegm surging upward, use Cui Shi Ba Wei Wan to stabilize. </p>
<p>If phlegm is lodged in the diaphragm causing fullness and heaviness, it can only be resolved through vomiting; however, it is not a fixed prescription.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>To establish a definitive method that everyone can utilize, why insist solely on promoting Zihe? Zihe necessarily considers the individual&#39;s condition before inducing vomiting. If one attempt does not suffice, one waits and tries again, easing into it gradually. The method of expelling phlegm through vomiting indeed has its own control and release, so it is clear that it is not used recklessly. Further discussion reveals that the &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot; employs methods of sweating, inducing vomiting, purging, and harmonizing with warming techniques. When it comes to phlegm and fluids, it is essential to address vomiting first; however, Zhang Zhongjing does not mention it. Why is this? The term &quot;vomit&quot; is used because phlegm and fluids rise as a result of internal pressure and overflow from within. If one states that inducing vomiting does not lead to recovery, it does not blame the act of vomiting itself. Moreover, it is said that those prone to vomiting are fundamentally thirsty, and thirst prompts the desire to relieve it, suggesting reliance on vomiting for relief. Why is there no clear mention that one should vomit? Zhang Zhongjing implies that within the evidence of phlegm and fluid syndrome, there are many mixed symptoms of counterflow, dizziness, etc.; inducing vomiting might be risky, hence he does not elaborate on it, refraining from making it a fundamental method to avoid leading future generations astray, thereby establishing himself as the founding father of this methodology. Since Zihe has gained fame by advocating for vomiting, the unknowledgeable rush to take shortcuts, which can lead to errors beyond description; one must truly understand Zhang Zhongjing’s intentions regarding vomiting to avoid inappropriate uses.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Retention of Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness and fainting cannot be treated with vomiting; high and shallow breathing cannot be treated with vomiting; fatigue that has not rested cannot be treated with vomiting; post-illness new frailty cannot be treated with vomiting; weak pulse cannot be treated with vomiting; critical illness cannot be treated with vomiting; excessive sweating due to yang deficiency cannot be treated with vomiting; history of blood loss cannot be treated with vomiting; misty weather and dimness cannot be treated with vomiting; winter&#39;s closed and hidden energy cannot be treated with vomiting; excessive doubt and little decisiveness cannot be treated with vomiting; and breaking prohibitions after vomiting cannot be treated with vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Drug Prohibitions</strong></p>
<p>For yin deficiency and dryness, do not recklessly use Er Chen. For yang deficiency and excessive sweating, do not recklessly use Qing Long. For heart deficiency and timid spirit, do not recklessly use pungent dispersants. For lung deficiency and lack of qi, do not recklessly use bitter purgatives. For liver deficiency with qi stagnation, do not recklessly use Long Huo. For spleen deficiency and swelling, do not recklessly use rolling phlegm. For stomach deficiency and depletion of fluids, do not recklessly use aromatic drying agents. For easily activated organs, do not recklessly use purging. If not a solid accumulation, do not recklessly use harsh attacks. For blood-qi deficiency and weakness, do not recklessly use acupuncture. </p>
<p><strong>Three Regulations</strong></p>
<p>Whenever phlegm heat rises with wind and fire, leading to dim vision and tinnitus, resembling a deficiency pattern, mistakenly applying warming tonics will trap the phlegm, leaving no way out—it is the doctor&#39;s fault. </p>
<p>Whenever phlegm and fluids exit along with food, not opening the pylorus but merely warming the stomach, leaving one helpless and delaying treatment, it is the doctor&#39;s fault. </p>
<p>Whenever facing symptoms of kidney deficiency with water overabundance, phlegm surging, high qi, and urgent breathing, not reinforcing the lower part but instead clearing the upper part will inevitably lead to qi collapse and death—this is the doctor&#39;s fault.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm and fluid, being of a yin nature, obstruct and suppress the yang. Using this yang medicine to transform energy and promote the yang is the correct method. The focus here is on cases of fullness and oppression in the chest and ribs, with accompanying dizziness. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that the pulse of the pericardium can cause disease related to fullness in the chest and ribs. Therefore, when phlegm and fluid accumulate in the pericardium, the resulting illness must manifest as such. Dizziness occurs when phlegm and fluid obstruct the yang in the chest, preventing the distribution of water essence upwards. Poria helps to treat phlegm and fluid, eliminate kidney evil, and promote the water pathways; cinnamon twig moves the yang qi, harmonizes the nutritive and defensive energies, and opens the meridians; white atractylodes addresses wind-related dizziness, dries phlegm and fluid, and relieves fullness; licorice, when used with poria, prevents excess fullness and promotes functional alleviation. The &quot;Ben Cao&quot; also states that licorice can descend qi and relieve fullness, which is why it is included.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction and Kidney Qi Pill</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; states that for shortness of breath with mild fluid accumulation, it should be resolved through urination. Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction and Kidney Qi Pill both address this condition. Presenting these two formulas, their profound meanings become all the more evident. In cases of shortness of breath, one formula is used for each aspect: for exhalation that is short, Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction is employed to open the yang, allowing qi transformation so urination can occur. For inhalation that is short, Kidney Qi Pill is used to open the yin; with the kidney qi unblocked, the gateway for urination is thereby facilitated. Each word and phrase carries deep essence, revealing the wisdom of the sages.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>On Big and Small Qinglong Decoction</strong></p>
<p>In the case of excessive drinking, when water overflows to the surface, the ying and wei are both adversely affected. One must follow the methods used for cold damage that harm both the ying and wei, inducing sweating to disperse the water. When the ying and wei are harmonious and the meridians flow smoothly, the water in the limbs will also dissipate. Ultimately, the Big Qinglong ascends to the heavens, producing clouds and rain, while the Small Qinglong stirs the waves and rushes into the vast sea. Therefore, for the treatment of water retention, the Small Qinglong must be regarded as the foremost principle.</p>
<p><strong>On the Ten Jujube Decoction and Gansui and Banxia Decoction</strong></p>
<p>For cold damage, with fullness and pain in both flanks, Ten Jujube Decoction should be administered. For phlegm and fluid retention illnesses, although they are not directly comparable to cold damage, if the retained water causes pain in the flanks, it is similar. Moreover, if the pulse is deep and tight, the pathogenic factor will not leave unless it is urgently expelled, hence using Ten Jujube Decoction is not considered excessive. Any illness located in the flanks that requires purging should follow this example. As for the Gansui and Gancao Decoction for treating retained fluids, it is subtle and profound; only those deep in the sacred domain can master it. The <em>Neijing</em> only states to attack the retained fluid, and thus Zhong Jing elaborated on its implications to encompass its variations. For intangible pathogenic energy, if heat is concentrated in the stomach, one should use the Adjust Stomach and Purge Decoction to attack it; if heat is concentrated in the intestines, one should use the Big and Small Purge Decoction to attack it. For tangible fluids, if they are collected in the chest, use the Chest Trap Decoction to attack; if they are collected in the flanks, use the Ten Jujube Decoction to attack; if they are retained between the intestines and stomach, use the Gansui and Banxia Decoction to attack.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>The text states that when a patient has a concealed pulse, they desire self-benefit, but such benefit leads to more discomfort. Even though there is a stubborn fullness in the heart area, this is due to the presence of retained fluids that need to be expelled. The formula &quot;Gansui Banxia Decoction&quot; is indicated for this condition. The pulse is obstructed by the retained fluids, which remain stagnant; thus, even though there is a desire for relief, it cannot be achieved. The persistent fullness in the heart area indicates that the fluids have reached the intestines, while their source is still in the stomach. Unless the root cause is addressed, the retained fluids cannot be eliminated, hence the creation of this formula. </p>
<p>Gansui and licorice are opposites and should be combined to effectively target the root of retention, allowing for their complete expulsion without preserving any medicinal properties. This aligns with the principle from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that emphasizes the importance of not discarding necessary elements. Additionally, white honey is added to avoid any adverse reactions. The inclusion of Banxia and Shaoyao is due to their relation to the transformation of wood into earth, solidifying the fullness. Banxia enhances the earth, and Shaoyao counters the wood—what is the underlying principle here? Later texts have often omitted licorice, leading to a decline in their efficacy and turning formulas into mere trivialities. This raises the question of what benefit such changes truly deliver.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>On the Three Formulas: Mufangji Decoction, Denglizhidaozhao Decoction, and Fangji Jiao Mu Denglizhihuang Pill</strong></p>
<p>All three formulas treat fluid accumulation entering the diaphragm, differing in depth and order of treatment. The first formula primarily treats the lung, the second firmly addresses the lung, and the third simultaneously treats the lung qi transmitted to the organs. Fluid accumulation enters the diaphragm, pressing against the heart and lungs, and may cause kidney problems. The text states that the person experiences wheezing and fullness, has a firm sensation below the heart, a dark complexion, and a tight, deep pulse. After several days, if the physician administers vomiting or purging and the patient does not improve, the Mufangji Decoction is indicated. If the condition is due to deficiency, it will improve; if due to excess, it may relapse after three days. For those unhealed, remove gypsum and add Poria and Glauber&#39;s salt. This is because fluid accumulation obstructs the qi, leading to wheezing and fullness in the lungs, while obstructing the blood causes a firm sensation below the heart. The kidney qi responds upwards, resulting in a dark complexion; thus, the blood&#39;s dark color appears on the face. However, it is important to ease the treatment of the heart and kidneys and prioritize the treatment of the lung. If lung qi is flowing, the fluid does not reverse, and they will both be resolved.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>Mutual infiltration of flavors and temperatures, such as morus wood and toxic herbs, can dissipate residual fluid and resolve qi stagnation, primarily addressing lung-related wheezing and fullness. Gypsum, with its slightly cold, sweet, and pungent properties, governs counterflow of qi in the chest, clears the lungs, and settles wheezing. Ginseng, warming and sweet, is effective for alleviating wheezing, dissolving phlegm, and replenishing the heart and lungs&#39; deficiencies. Cinnamon twig is spicy and warm, promoting blood flow, unblocking qi, and harmonizing various medicines for immediate effect when taken in the qi level. </p>
<p>However, if the fluid is within the blood aspect and deeply connected to the lower energies, recurrence is inevitable. Therefore, it is necessary to remove gypsum, which addresses the qi aspect, and incorporate Glauber&#39;s salt to resolve phlegm accumulation and eliminate blood stagnation, combining it with poria to soften hardness below the heart and also tackle kidney evil. </p>
<p>The Da Zao Tang, by forcefully draining lung qi, also treats cases where fluids accumulate due to stagnation. The Fang Ji Jiao Mu Ting Li Da Huang Wan is indicated for abdominal fullness with dry mouth and tongue, as well as the presence of watery qi in the intestines, attributed to lung qi congestion leading to fluid retention below. To urgently open the waterways and relieve the trapped lung qi, this pill is used to approach the lower aspect of treatment, making it a pill form for effectiveness.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>On Xiaobanjia Decoction, Xiaobanjia Decocted with Poria, and the Poria Drink from the External Source</strong></p>
<p>The first formula treats phlegm-dampness with vomiting but no thirst. The phlegm dampness rises to the diaphragm, leading to vomiting; its force is most prominent when it ascends. However, if one vomits, thirst is normally expected, and if there is thirst, one can expect the phlegm-dampness to completely disperse. If there is no thirst, then some fluid remains, indicating that it hasn’t been entirely expelled. There is no need for additional treatment; simply using the acrid warmth of Banxia and the acrid dispersing qualities of fresh ginger will help urge out what remains, thus allowing any retained evils to dissipate.</p>
<p>The middle formula also treats sudden vomiting, but with more pronounced heaviness in the abdomen and water retention in the diaphragm causing dizziness and palpitations. Therefore, Poria is added to remove water and tranquilize the heart. </p>
<p>The final formula includes ginseng, bitter orange, and tangerine peel, which is particularly crucial. It treats accumulated fluid that has been dispersed, yet the qi remains trapped and full, preventing the intake of food. This condition is most commonly encountered. The &quot;Jinkui&quot; earlier included the formula from the &quot;External Source&quot; to enlighten later generations. Who, if not the wise awareness of the celestial people, could have foreseen this? </p>
<p><strong>On ZeXie Decoction and Huopo Dahuang Decoction</strong><a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>The text discusses the treatment of fluid retention (支饮) and associated symptoms as described in classical Chinese medicine. It details two different approaches to address the condition: </p>
<p>The first approach addresses the retention of fluids affecting the heart, which obstructs the upward and downward movements of Yang Qi, leading to symptoms such as dizziness and a feeling of heaviness. If one does not treat the dizziness directly but instead facilitates urination to expel the retained fluids, the Yang Qi can rise properly, and the associated wind and fire symptoms will subside. This is a common method practiced by Zhang Zhongjing.</p>
<p>The second approach pertains to the treatment of chest fullness caused by fluid retention. In this case, Zhang Zhongjing would use a specific formula to address the condition, which involves purging trapped heat and fluid from the body.</p>
<p>The text also references the Wuling San formula, indicating that if a thin person experiences palpitations and produces frothy saliva with dizziness, this is due to water retention and the Wuling San formula is indicated. The underlying principle is that a build-up of fluids in the body due to their inherent Yin qualities can lead to these symptoms, and it is not enough to treat the dizziness directly; one must disperse the accompanying Yin pathogenic factors for a cure. Thus, proper treatment will alleviate the condition.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The method for dispersing the Yin pathogen should indeed start from the exterior; however, it is better to follow the method of Wu Ling San, which also benefits the water. Those in the modern world who use Wu Ling San only understand it as a formula to regulate the distribution of food and water, not realizing its significance in balancing the interior and exterior, Yin and Yang. The text mentions drinking warm water and sweating as beneficial but fails to note these essential points, showing a profound lack of understanding! Moreover, regarding Xiao Qing Long Tang, people only recognize it as a light remedy for releasing the exterior and do not realize it is designed to facilitate the small water. The Xiao Long from the mountains and marshes grows its horns and rushes towards the dark sea amidst thunder and rain; it cannot simply ascend to the heavens. Thus, the treatment for cough and thirst in the &quot;Jin Kui&quot; largely draws from Xiao Qing Long Tang for modification, aiming to unblock the waterways, without leaving any path unfollowed.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Questions and Answers on Phlegm Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The person was told: The rules for treating phlegm do not appear in the prescription books. For a condition above, one would use formulas like Guati Powder or Zhihua Decoction; for the left side, Longhui Pill; for the right side, Gunphlegm Pill; and for those of weak constitution, Zhu Li Datan Pill. In cases of cold and stagnant conditions, Sanjian Decoction can be used. All these methods lack profound principles; how can one expect to master them readily, and can they be passed down on paper? I will now transmit this knowledge to the younger generation. </p>
<p>The essence is that when the five flavors enter the mouth, they are stored in the stomach, which serves as the sea of food and drink, and the central controller of the five organs and six bowels. When a person consumes too much food and drink, phlegm and saliva are produced. This occurs as phlegm saturates the meridians, following the healthy functioning of the spleen and its ability to circulate. The dynamics of this back and forth resemble the ebb and flow of ocean tides: when the energy of the spleen flows, the tide goes out; when it stops, the tide returns. Therefore, the method for treating stagnation involves taking warming, spicy substances to slightly invigorate and relieve the cold that has condensed. After this, one must stop further intervention, as allowing phlegm to become hot and move recklessly can lead to significant harm. </p>
<p>Not only can phlegm behave erratically when heated, but excessive heat in the spleen can also cause it to become overly active without rest, reminiscent of tides that flow out without returning. The consequences of such phlegm disorders can be grave indeed.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Those who have long consumed harsh and strong medicines also yearn for food in the dead of night. People do not understand the reason for this; instead, they celebrate the ability to eat without realizing the importance of preserving the spleen&#39;s function, allowing it to operate during the day and rest at night, which is necessary for balance. Furthermore, the phlegm in the human body flows from the stomach through the meridians; thus, the phlegm from the meridians must return to the stomach to rise up through the mouth and descend through the intestines. This can only happen when the spleen’s function is tranquil. Therefore, anyone with phlegm-related issues should not only eat early and at noon but should also rest and preserve the spleen&#39;s function to allow the phlegm in the meridians to return to the stomach, where it can properly ascend and descend, rather than dispersing from the spleen. Observe those with mild phlegm conditions who can comfortably sleep at night and the next morning can expel phlegm; contrast this with those with severe phlegm conditions who are dazed, unable to expel it due to lack of food and the spleen not being at rest, thus blocking the phlegm’s exit. Do those who love to use strong medicines realize this? Alas! Many in the world who enjoy spicy and heated treatments manage to eat at night; will they reconsider their words and reflect three times?<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br><strong>On Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The condition of phlegm and fluid is only mentioned in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as a case of accumulated fluid, and it never explicitly refers to phlegm as a disease. This indicates that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not place significant emphasis on the phlegm condition. Upon examining the term &quot;phlegm,&quot; though it originated from Zhongjing, it has been passed down through generations, and regardless of whether one discusses phlegm or not, people often mention &quot;phlegm-fire.&quot; Some say strange diseases are due to phlegm, while others claim phlegm is the source of numerous ailments, suggesting that the relationship with phlegm is not taken lightly. So why then does the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; overlook it? </p>
<p>One must understand that the occurrence of phlegm as a disease must have its causes. For example, if phlegm arises from wind or fire, treating the wind or fire will clear the phlegm on its own. If phlegm arises from deficiency or excess, addressing the deficiency or excess will also resolve the phlegm. I have never heard of treating phlegm alone to disperse wind and fire or to adjust deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>This is why phlegm must arise due to illness, and not the other way around—illness does not cause phlegm. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not mention phlegm, specifically because phlegm is not the root of the disease; it is merely a symptom. Today, practitioners worldwide focus solely on attacking phlegm, believing that this treats the disease, yet they do not understand what phlegm is or how it arises. This is akin to pointing at an arm to understand the shoulder or watering leaves to save the roots. Misrecognition of symptoms and underlying causes leads to losing the true perspective; seeking to cure the disease becomes difficult.</p>
<p>Although phlegm and liquid are said to belong to the same category, they are indeed different. Liquid pertains to water and fluids; any vomiting of clear water, abdominal distension, sour belching, or sounds of wetness are all symptoms of stagnant food and fluids that do not circulate—this is referred to as liquid. Phlegm, however, differs from liquid; liquid is clear, while phlegm is thick and turbid. Liquid merely stagnates in the intestines and stomach, while phlegm can appear in any part of the body.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>When food and drink do not transform and instead become phlegm, this illness is entirely due to the spleen and stomach. Phlegm arises from various organs&#39; injuries, and thus, in treating this, one must understand how to discern the problem, paying close attention to its root. </p>
<p>Phlegm is essentially the body&#39;s fluids, transformed from food and drink. This phlegm is a transformed substance, not something that does not transform. When transformation occurs properly, the body is strong, and nourishment flows abundantly, with phlegm and mucus originating from blood and qi. However, when transformation goes awry, the organs suffer, fluids become disrupted, and blood and qi turn into phlegm and mucus. This is akin to thieves arising in a chaotic world; who among them does not wish for peace? Yet, the rise of thieves is surely due to the decline of the state, and the emergence of phlegm and mucus must occur due to the decay of vital energy. </p>
<p>I once heard Mr. Li Zhai say: if blood and qi are both flourishing, how could there be phlegm? In my early years, I somewhat doubted this statement, thinking, is there truly no real phlegm? But now, having gained deeper understanding, I begin to believe it.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>How can one see this? The transformation of phlegm and saliva fundamentally arises from food and water. If the spleen is strong and the stomach healthy, just like in youth, then it transforms food into blood and qi as it is consumed, leaving no room for phlegm to remain. However, if transformation is not complete, and one or two parts are left over, then those become phlegm; if three or four parts linger, then those are phlegm too; and if seven or eight remain, one will see the daily decline of blood and qi, while phlegm increases daily. The reason for this is that the original qi cannot function effectively, and as deficiency increases, phlegm becomes more abundant. Thus, the words of Li Zhai suggest a perspective beyond the ordinary. Currently, those who treat phlegm always say it is the cause of suffering and that one must attack it to eliminate it. They do not realize that when the righteous qi is stagnant and phlegm accumulates due to deficiency, even with vigorous efforts to attack it, not only can phlegm not be expelled, but the deficiency may worsen. Some may experience sudden cessation of phlegm due to aggressive treatment, only to find that it becomes more severe later on—this is a miscalculation in treatment. Few know that the phlegm that can be attacked is rarer, while the phlegm that cannot be attacked is more common; hence, those treating phlegm must first assess the underlying deficiency or excess.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>Phlegm has qualities of deficiency and excess, and it is important to distinguish between them. If phlegm were always in excess, then what difference would there be between deficiency and excess? The terms deficiency and excess are entirely related to the original qi. Anything that can be addressed or treated is considered excess phlegm; anything that cannot be addressed is considered deficient phlegm. What does it mean to be treatable? It refers to cases where the body’s strength is still robust, the blood and qi are not harmed, or when there is an overabundance of rich and sweet foods, or when dampness and heat are prevalent, or when wind and cold block the skin, or when rebellious qi obstructs the liver and diaphragm; all these can suddenly lead to phlegm retention. By observing the manifestations and the signs of disease, anything that is characterized by excess is excess phlegm. What is excess phlegm? It means that the original qi is still strong. In this case, it is appropriate to disperse and eliminate it, as it is permissible to remove the phlegm. What does it mean to be untreatable? This refers to cases where the body is slender and weak, or where one has reached middle age and is declining; such conditions indicate deficient phlegm.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Some are plagued by various illnesses, some by exhaustion, and some by worries, drink, and indulgence, leading to fatigue and ailments that are not due to wind or sudden seizures but rather to phlegm due to deficiency. Others may present with thin and rapid pulses, and without any pathogenic factors in the organs, exhibiting symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and hoarseness. However, upon observing their physical condition and the nature of their symptoms, if there is no excess, it is all phlegm due to deficiency. What is phlegm due to deficiency? It refers to the depletion of one&#39;s vital energy. In this case, one should only proceed with nourishment and reinforcement; any attempt to attack it will lead to danger. Moreover, in the case of phlegm due to excess, it is originally not abundant, it arises suddenly, disperses quickly, and the illness is easy to treat. Why is that? Because the illness is not deep-rooted. In contrast, phlegm due to deficiency is often abundant; it accumulates gradually, disperses slowly, and is difficult to treat. Why is that? Because the illness has persisted for a long time. Therefore, phlegm due to excess is not a great concern, while phlegm due to deficiency is the most fearsome. In summary, the method to treat phlegm is straightforward: the key is to strengthen the vital energy daily, and then the phlegm will gradually decrease. Even if there is a slight phlegm, it will not cause harm, and it will also support the stomach’s energy. Conversely, if the vital energy declines daily, then all fluids from food and drink will essentially turn into phlegm.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>As one goes, one lives; if there are those who can attack it to the end, while also protecting the original vital energy unharmed, I do not believe it is possible. Therefore, those skilled in treating phlegm are only able to prevent its generation, which is the true art of mending heaven. Hence, regarding treatment of this condition, one cannot discern its reality or falsehood, and wishes to attack it indiscriminately, as Wang Yinjun discussed, claiming that all internal and external ailments arise from phlegm, applying remedies like the rolling phlegm pill without knowing the future harm that may ensue. </p>
<p>While diseases of the five organs can indeed produce phlegm, they all derive from the spleen and kidneys. The kidneys govern dampness; when dampness moves, it becomes phlegm. The kidneys also govern water; when water overflows, it too becomes phlegm. Hence, the transformation of phlegm does not occur without the spleen, and the essence of phlegm always lies in the kidneys. Therefore, every phlegm condition, whether one aspect or the other, must involve these two organs. However, phlegm from the spleen can be either deficient or excessive. If there is excessive stagnation of dampness, it is due to the spleen being full; if the earth is weak and cannot control water, it results from the spleen being deficient. Conversely, phlegm arising from the kidneys is always a matter of deficiency.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>The essence of fire cannot generate earth; that is, fire does not control water, and yang cannot overcome yin, which results in water invading the spleen; this indicates a deficiency of fire within yin. Conversely, if fire is strong and scorches metal, essence cannot reside properly, and fluids dry up, leading to mutual destruction between metal and water; this indicates a deficiency of water within yin. This distinction between the deficiency and surplus of the spleen and kidneys must be clarified. </p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding what ancient people referred to as damp phlegm, stagnant phlegm, cold phlegm, and heat phlegm, despite their differing locations—whether up or down, cold or hot—each has its own characteristics; however, their origins of transformation must also involve these two organs. For instance, cold phlegm and damp phlegm fundamentally stem from spleen issues, yet does the generation of cold dampness not also involve the kidneys? Wind from wood stagnation originates from the liver&#39;s phlegm, but when wood overpowers earth, can it not also relate to the spleen? When fire is strong and attacks metal, phlegm resides in the lungs, and when fire pathogenic heat rises, can it not impact both the upper and lower jiao? Therefore, anyone wishing to treat phlegm without understanding its source is merely guessing.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The phlegm of the spleen and stomach can be either due to deficiency or excess. When the dampness of the spleen soil is excessive, or when there is overindulgence in food and drink, and there are no deficiency symptoms that lead to phlegm, this is a primary condition of the spleen. Simply removing the dampness will clear the phlegm, and the primary treatment should be Er Chen Decoction, or alternatives such as Liu An Decoction, Tangerine Peel and Pinellia Decoction, Ping Wei San, Run Xia Wan, and Gun Tan Wan, among others. If phlegm arises from cold in the stomach along with bloating, He Wei Er Chen Decoction should be used; if accompanied by vomiting and pain, Shen Xiang San is appropriate; if caused by food, one should add malt, spirit-activated barley, hawthorn, and bitter orange. However, if the spleen and stomach are not deficient, then even if phlegm and fluid arise, it is likely only slight retention, thus not very harmful. Only in cases where the spleen is deficient and food cannot be digested, leading to phlegm, can the variations be many. The solution lies in regulating the spleen and stomach to strengthen their qi, which will eliminate the problems of food stagnation, making the phlegm and fluids part of the blood and qi.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>If the spleen qi is slightly deficient and unable to control dampness, or unable to transform and thus produces phlegm, the symptoms will be reduced appetite and fatigue, possibly accompanied by feelings of fullness or oppression. The appropriate treatments are six gentlemen decoction or five-flavored pilose antler powder, with Jinshui Liu Jun decoction also being excellent. If there is slight deficiency combined with cold, use Ling Zhu Er Chen decoction for treatment. If the spleen qi is greatly deficient, or if there is accompanying stomach cold leading to nausea and excessive phlegm, one should use six flavors of medicinal herbs decoction, warming the stomach drink, or regulating middle decoction as treatments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, overexertion can damage the spleen, and extreme fatigue can harm the liver and kidneys. With spleen qi damage, intake may decrease or nausea may be experienced; with liver and kidney damage, there may be misdirection of fluids or phlegm rising from below the navel. This indicates injury to both the spleen and kidney, a condition related to the root of life and mother of the earth. While the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill is the standard treatment, the Yin regulating decoction is even more effective. White atractylodes and dried tangerine peel may also be added.</p>
<p>Phlegm originating from the kidney channel occurs when fluid becomes phlegm, which is mostly a deficiency syndrome. There are instances where swelling leads to phlegm due to water entering the spleen channel, termed counteracting. For a balanced condition, one should use the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill or Zuo Gui Decoction as treatments.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>For those with cold and dampness, it is advisable to treat with warming decoctions such as Yin Jian and modified versions of Ren Shen Qi Wan and Ba Wei Di Huang Wan. If one merely requires warmth and dryness, then solely assisting the spleen channel can also resolve dampness; in this case, Liu Wei Di Huang Jian, Li Zhong Tang, and Sheng Zhu Jian can be appropriately used. In cases of deficiency leading to phlegm, where water is depleted and metal is drained, essence cannot transform into qi, and qi cannot transform into essence. If one does not nourish yin to support yang, then water and qi will not be sufficient, leading to unresolved phlegm and stagnant water. It is advisable to use formulations such as Zuo Gui Wan, You Gui Wan, Liu Wei Wan, and Ba Wei Wan, adjusting for cold and heat as necessary. If yin fire attacks the lungs, causing dry fluids, sore throat, restlessness, preference for cold, or firm stools, one must check for genuine fire evil and persistent phlegm cough. In such cases, modified versions of Si Yin Jian and Yi Yin Jian should be prescribed. If the fire is not genuine, then pure tonification is sufficient to ensure safety and health.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>Phlegm caused by wind-cold arises from external pathogens affecting the skin and hair, invading the lungs, leading to unclear lung qi and subsequently the production of phlegm. This is a type of cold damage; if treated with pungent and dispersing methods, the phlegm can resolve on its own. It is advisable to use formulas like Liu&#39;an Decoction or Erchen Decoction, and for more severe cases, Xiao Qinglong Decoction or similar remedies. If there is an external invasion of wind-cold combined with internal fire, one may also use Huangqin. In cases where blood and qi are both deficient, one should not solely rely on depleting treatments but should use Jinshui Liujun Decoction as the main remedy. If cold damage is accompanied by wind and symptoms like fever, cough, and phlegm, then Chai Chen Decoction should be used, or Jinshui Liujun Decoction with added Chaihu may also be appropriate.</p>
<p>Phlegm due to stroke is not an external influence but is caused by spleen and kidney deficiency. The methods for treating phlegm are detailed elsewhere and should be examined in conjunction with this. </p>
<p>When treating phlegm, one must differentiate between urgent and mild cases. In cases that are not related to wind but have phlegm obstructing and filling the upper burner, where medicine and food cannot be ingested, it is essential to first treat the phlegm to open the clearing pathway. If the phlegm is severe, inducing vomiting is the most effective method. If the phlegm is not so severe and food and drink can be taken, treatment should focus gently on addressing the root cause without rashly attacking, preferably using Liu&#39;an Decoction, Erchen Decoction, Runxia Pills, or Chenpi Banxia Decoction for regulation. If fire is vigorous and producing phlegm, then Qingge Decoction or Chouxin Drink should be used as the main treatment.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>If symptoms resemble phlegm but there is no obstruction in the upper burner, and if one sees signs of lethargy or confusion while breathing clearly and evenly, without visible phlegm, one must not hastily conclude it is phlegm and recklessly use remedies to eliminate it, for doing so will inevitably lead to failure. If mixed symptoms have worsened, and there is a gurgling phlegmatic sound in the throat that worsens with breathing, this is a critical situation that cannot be treated. </p>
<p>To treat phlegm, one must address the root cause, thus phlegm can be eliminated. If one only focuses on treating the phlegm itself, such a misunderstanding can lead to serious errors. All phlegm caused by excessive heat should first be addressed by treating the heat; phlegm resulting from cold should prioritize warming the center. Phlegm from wind should be dispelled, and spicy warming agents are essential. Phlegm due to dampness should be dried out; simply promoting urination will not resolve it. </p>
<p>Stagnant phlegm has both excess and deficiency; if stagnation is accompanied by anger, one should suppress the liver’s evil; if accompanied by worry, one should support both the liver and lungs. Phlegm arising from diet also varies; some arise from cold, some from heat, some from excessive richness, and others from dampness due to alcohol harming the spleen. All of these can produce phlegm, each with its own nuances of deficiency and excess, and one must discern them accurately.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>In cases of spleen deficiency that cannot control dampness, or kidney deficiency that cannot restrain water, both can lead to phlegm, which belongs to the category of cold phlegm. This phlegm may be caused by the spleen&#39;s yin drying out and transforming into a glue-like substance, or from the deterioration of metal and water leading to phlegm originating from blood, which is associated with heat phlegm. Generally, these two conditions account for the vast majority of phlegm syndromes, particularly those of phlegm that cannot be easily resolved due to deficiency. Furthermore, if there is excessive use of harsh and drastic treatments that exacerbate phlegm, it also indicates damage to the spleen and kidneys, highlighting the rarity of successful treatments that do not address the root cause.</p>
<p>Many schools of thought on treating phlegm tend to focus on superficial symptoms; while such methods cannot be completely dismissed, they should also not be the sole approach. The detailed treatment methods are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>For phlegm caused by exterior conditions, induce sweating; for interior conditions, use purgation; for phlegm combined with dampness, use diuretics. </li>
<li>If phlegm is lodged in the diaphragm, expectoration is essential; purgation alone will not suffice. </li>
<li>For thick, turbid phlegm, expectoration is mandatory.</li>
<li>Phlegm in the meridians can only be resolved through expectoration, which has the additional meaning of dispersing.</li>
<li>Phlegm located in the intestines and stomach can be eliminated through purgation. </li>
<li>Phlegm in the limbs can only be accessed through bamboo juice.</li>
<li>Phlegm beneath the ribs can only be expelled using white mustard seeds.</li>
<li>Phlegm located in the skin and superficial membranes cannot be reached without ginger juice or bamboo juice.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>For phlegm heat, it is advisable to use Qingdai, Huangqin, Tianhuafen, Lianqiao, and Shigao. For high fire, use Liujing ointment. For chronic phlegm, use Haishi, (round-leaved) Chuanlian, and Beimu; for those with strong fire and thickening phlegm, the Jiezhai Huatan pills are appropriate. For real phlegm heat, the Gunfan pills are most effective, but should not be used excessively. For wind phlegm, use Nuxing and Bai Fuzhi. For damp phlegm, use Cangzhu, Baizhu, Banxia, Fuling, and Zexie. For food accumulation phlegm, use Shenqu, Hawthorn, and Malt. For wine phlegm, use Tianhuafen, Huanglian, Baizhu, Shenqu, or the Wuling powder and Siling powder to help alleviate it. For phlegm retained in the throat, difficult to expectorate, add salty medicine to the phlegm-dissolving medicine to soften the hardness, along with (round-leaved) Chuanlian seeds, apricot kernels, Haishi, (sodium bicarbonate), and kelp, with ginger juice as an aid. Zhuli is effective in guiding phlegm, but moves through the meridians only with ginger juice. Jingli treats phlegm quickly and can be used by those who can eat. The combination of the two li with ginger juice is most effective for treating meridian phlegm. If there is blood in the phlegm, it is advisable to add chives juice.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>Sea flour can clear heat phlegm, dry damp phlegm, soften hard phlegm, and eliminate stubborn phlegm. It can be used in pill formulas as well as decoctions. Nanzhong and Banxia treat wind phlegm and damp phlegm. Gypsum effectively clears phlegm-heat. Huangqin treats heat phlegm, assisting its downward movement. Zhishi treats phlegm and has the ability to break through walls and overturn barriers. Wubeizi can treat chronic phlegm, especially when combined with other herbs, this method is largely unknown. Tianhuafen is most effective for heat phlegm and alcohol phlegm, also referred to as greatly addressing heat phlegm in the diaphragm. Yuanming powder addresses heat phlegm and chronic phlegm quickly, as it can lower fire and soften hard masses. Nitrate rock and montmorillonite are powerful in eliminating phlegm accumulation and reducing phlegm-heat; grind into a fine powder, mix with white sugar, and place in the palm, using the tongue to ingest for significant effect. Cangzhu treats phlegm-dampness and is exceptionally effective in moving phlegm. It also treats phlegm combined with blood stasis forming a mass, akin to Shenzhuwan. Runxiawan is particularly effective for lowering phlegm and can be taken regularly. Xiaoweidan is essential for treating phlegm accumulation with water, typically requiring only two or three doses; it should not be used for those with deficiency. For phlegm resulting from insufficient middle qi, ginseng and atractylodes must be used. In cases of internal injury involving phlegm, always use ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes, often utilizing ginger juice for transmission, or adding Banxia and Fuling. If there is phlegm in the middle jiao, it must be nourished by stomach qi; hence, one must not use aggressive attacks. If one attacks thoroughly, it will lead to great deficiency.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br><strong>Family Tradition of Vomiting Method</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In his youth, the late Duke Shoufeng was well known for his drinking. Upon reaching his forties, he developed a drunkenness sickness, leading to the illness of phlegm and fluid retention. He frequently experienced sour vomiting and abdominal distention, with his appetite diminishing day by day. Symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, anxiety, and intermittent fevers followed in succession. Despite trying numerous remedies for phlegm, none had any effect. Inspired by the remarkable vomiting method of Zhang Zihe, he decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Initially, he used Duxing San, tea mixtures, and juices like leek. After one vomit, there was slight improvement; after another, more noticeable effects. From then on, he used it repeatedly. Although the phlegm gradually receded, his vitality did not recover. After more than a year, he felt gradually more skilled and suddenly understood the principle behind it, thus deciding to use no medicine at all. After eating breakfast, he would slowly gulp air, leading to throat movements that prompted immediate clearing of saliva. After a few more gulps, the thicker phlegm would follow.</p>
<p>From then on, whenever he encountered any ailments, regardless of whether they were superficial or deep, he would never take medicine. Instead, he used the vomiting method, which would effectively clear the issue by the same day. After reaching his sixties, he would perform it once a month or every half month without hesitation. He remained untroubled by fatigue, and his gray hair contrasted with a youthful complexion, growing increasingly vigorous each day.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>At this time, the guest was young and gradually gaining knowledge. Concerned that his approach might cause harm by inducing vomiting, he subtly advised: &quot;Vomiting originates from phlegm, but can it be that all diseases can be treated by vomiting? Moreover, vomiting harms the vital energy, which is well understood; especially in declining years, can one not be cautious?&quot; The late sovereign replied: &quot;Vomiting is known to treat phlegm, that much is true; but do you know that it can also treat numerous diseases? Vomiting can harm the energy, you understand that; but do you also understand that it can generate energy? I shall elaborate for you. Among the ancient sages, there is no method better than the three techniques of Zihe and the reversed warehouse of Dankai. However, the method of reversed warehouse is difficult to practice, and few dare to use it. Only Zihe&#39;s techniques are commonly employed, yielding quick and abundant results. Now, speaking from my own methods, there are differences.&quot;<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>The method of &quot;he&quot; involves inducing vomiting through medicine, which must be bitter and harsh; thus, the vomiting is forceful, and this is beyond my control, leading to inevitable harm. My own approach to vomiting does not use medicine; rather, phlegm follows the flow of qi, and qi arrives due to phlegm, allowing for a gradual response that can be beneficial and without harm. The method of &quot;he&quot; is applied in urgent situations, targeting the excess of phlegm. My method is intended for a gentler approach, capable of treating various deficiencies and a hundred diseases. The causes of a hundred diseases are inherently diverse, so why is vomiting appropriate for all? When phlegm and saliva are excessive and block the stomach and intestines, making the pathway clear impossible, one must induce vomiting. When there is an accumulation causing pain that is difficult to disperse, one must induce vomiting. When the phlegm is thickened and turbid, not easily resolved by medicine, one must induce vomiting. When phlegm resides in the meridians, membranes, and other difficult-to-identify locations, being deeply hidden and stored far away from medicinal reach, one must induce vomiting.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>This is all easily understood by people. Moreover, if one is affected by cold winds, vomiting can disperse it; if injury is caused by food and drink, vomiting can clear it; if there is stagnation due to heat, vomiting can release it; if the heat evil is severe, vomiting can mobilize the yang energy; if various evils are descending, vomiting has the function of rising; if evils are accumulating, vomiting has the power to dissolve them. Furthermore, all diseases in humans are fundamentally due to an obstruction in the flow of vital energy. Vomiting can facilitate the movement of this energy; when energy flows, nothing remains unaddressed, and thus there are no diseases. Therefore, for any strange and hard-to-treat illness, when physicians exhaust all their skills without success, they must employ the method of vomiting to reveal miraculous results, which is something not well-known to people. </p>
<p>Additionally, as for the concept of generating energy, not only do people not understand it, but they may also outright disbelieve it. I, through personal practice and experience, have begun to perceive its subtlety. The workings of heaven and earth, which never cease, fundamentally revolve around the rise and fall of two forms of energy. Rising is rooted in yang, the way of growth; descending is rooted in yin, the way of decline. My use of energy is based on this rising and uplifting principle. It can be quick or slow, naturally incorporating the life force; without harm or violence, it encompasses the miraculous effects of non-medicinal means. Therefore, after vomiting, the spirit and energy are bound to be enhanced, as you have observed. The path of yang must surely flourish; this is what I usually verify. If it were not for vomiting being able to generate energy, could it be so? Taoists use the Governing Vessel, while I employ the Conception Vessel; the methods used are different, but they lead to the same outcome. This not only counters illness but also extends life.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>I say this is not erroneous, you should fully understand it! Those who follow this instruction and practice it regularly will find it effective, though it may not reach the divine subtlety of the late Emperor. Since the time of Xuanchi, only you, Zi He, have adeptly employed the method of expelling. Comparatively, if one were to measure with the Emperor&#39;s techniques, the differences in difficulty and efficacy are like the contrast between heaven and earth. The one said to be unparalleled since ancient times certainly cannot be Zi He. If the wise see the same, they will certainly follow in your footsteps, and those to come should not be few. However, I fear that in a hundred generations, this heart and the marvelous way may fade, which is why I have detailed and recorded these teachings, providing a complete account of the method below:</p>
<p>The late Emperor&#39;s method of expelling was practiced at the time of the fifth watch, when waking from sleep, lying on one&#39;s back, using belching to guide the breath. If the breath is insufficient, one swallows to belch, lifting the breath as one swallows, and phlegm will inevitably follow the breath. Even the deepest phlegm can be expelled, but the last to exit may have an appearance, color, and odor that is exceedingly vile and cannot be put into words. Therefore, after expelling, one may find their lips swollen and throat sore, but this can be relieved with a few sips of cool water. After expulsion, one should avoid all five flavors for breakfast, only consuming one or two bowls of plain porridge to nourish the clear energies within the stomach. After a period of forty days, one should absolutely avoid alcohol. Those who practiced this expelling method for over forty years, thus growing stronger with age, lived to their eighties and could still climb mountains and transcribe ancient books under the lamp. Later, without illness, one suddenly smiled and began fasting, reaching the age of eighty-two.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>The Root of Treating Phlegm</p>
<p>Excess phlegm in a person arises from a deficiency in the internal system. Phlegm is essentially water, with its foundation in the kidneys and its manifestation in the spleen. In the kidneys, it is due to water not returning to its origin, causing it to become phlegm. In the spleen, it occurs when food and drink are not transformed, as the earth does not control the water. Observing robust individuals who indulge in excess drinking and eating, one finds that their consumption is swiftly transformed, and they do not manifest phlegm. It is only those who cannot eat that tend to produce phlegm, because their spleen is deficient and cannot metabolize food, and thus food becomes phlegm. Therefore, in cases of deficiency and exhaustion, there is bound to be an increase in phlegm, and in critical illnesses, phlegm becomes even more severe, primarily because the spleen&#39;s energy becomes increasingly deficient, resulting in an inability to transform it, leading all liquids to turn into phlegm. Thus, is the relationship between disease and phlegm such that disease comes from phlegm or phlegm from disease? Is it not clear that phlegm must arise from deficiency? It can be seen that there are very few cases of actual phlegm, and similarly few opportunities to address phlegm. Therefore, in treating phlegm, one must warm the spleen and strengthen the kidneys to address the root of phlegm, ensuring that the foundation gradually becomes more robust, leading to the natural resolution of phlegm without needing treatment.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br><strong>On Phlegm and the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>I have often heard it said in common discourse: phlegm pervades the whole body, causing ailments that are hard to diagnose. Conditions such as paralysis, stroke, and hemiplegia are all due to phlegm stagnating. If this is the case, then phlegm is indeed an evil influence; if phlegm is not eliminated, how can the illness possibly recover? I say: do you know the origin of phlegm? </p>
<p>The phlegm in the meridians arises from the transformation of bodily fluids and blood. When the Wei and Ying energies are harmonized, the fluids flow properly and blood circulates freely, then what phlegm could exist? It is only when the original Yang is depleted and the Spirit&#39;s mechanism is exhausted that the water becomes devoid of vitality, leading to thickened fluids and deteriorated blood, which then transforms into phlegm. This is indeed phlegm, it is truly essence and blood. How can there be a notion of phlegm separate from essence and blood? </p>
<p>If one asserts that phlegm resides in the meridians and cannot be expelled without attacking it directly, then one must also eliminate essence and blood alongside it, which might be acceptable. Otherwise, how can one solely target phlegm while essence and blood remain untouched? If the bodily fluids and blood are further harmed, the original vital energy will become increasingly depleted, and anything removed will lead to further transformation of phlegm; thus, those who treat phlegm cannot fully succeed, and what they do manage to expel is merely the original energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are cases where phlegm is nonexistent at the root, yet misguided efforts identify something as phlegm, leading to mistaken treatment—how profoundly ignorant this is! Therefore, any use of phlegm remedies such as rolling phlegm pills or wind-searching and qi-regulating pills must ensure that the original energy remains unharmed, and only in situations of occasional stagnation or slight unclarity of phlegm can these remedies be temporarily employed; it cannot be said that they are ineffective. If the original energy is affected and one only knows to address the symptoms, there has never been an instance where daily treatment did not lead to daily decline.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br><strong>On Non-Wind Phlegm Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>When treating phlegm, if it is not a case of initial wind disease and the phlegm qi is not severe, one must not hastily assume it is phlegm and recklessly use phlegm-dispelling medicines; this is a great caution. If phlegm and saliva are obstructively excessive, filling the chest and diaphragm to the point that neither soup nor liquid can enter, then one must first open the phlegm to clear the pathway for medicines and food. The most effective method to open phlegm is through vomiting, as in the ancient formulas like Du Sheng San, Cha Diao San, and Xi Yan San, all of which are remedies for inducing vomiting. However, there is concern that if the vital energy is greatly deficient, it may not withstand such harsh treatments; thus, it would be more prudent to use new vomiting methods or utilize medicines like Niu Huang Wan or Bao Long Wan, ensuring that the throat and qi are unobstructed enough to allow for ingestion of soup and drink. One must not entirely attack the phlegm to the point of jeopardizing health, which requires utmost caution. Therefore, the method of treating phlegm must also assess whether it can be attacked or not before proceeding; this will avoid errors. If the eyes are glaring and the teeth are clenched, the limbs are rigid, and the face is flushed strong and vigorous, even if there is a clouded mind, it is still treatable. First, use a coarse utensil to pry open the mouth, then with a solid writing rod, keep the jaws steady, and slowly administer a light ginger and salt soup. Next, insert two fingers into the throat, slowly guiding them to induce vomiting. If the fingers cannot reach, a goose feather dipped in soup can substitute for probing to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>After several attempts, if one can expel the phlegm and feel relief, one is bound to gradually awaken, and then it is appropriate to consider administering medicine. This is the method for treating phlegm obstruction. However, if the signs of death are already present and there is a gurgling sound of phlegm in the throat, expelling it will be of no benefit and there is no need to do so. If the phlegm and qi are exceedingly strong and cannot be expelled, it is also a sign that no treatment is required. Additionally, for those whose constitution is severely weak, one should avoid means of expulsion, as they should not be attacked in this manner. If the physical symptoms are established but the phlegm and qi are not severe, one should absolutely not treat the phlegm. Instead, one should focus on regulating qi and blood to achieve gradual recovery. If phlegm and fluids are not yet cleared, the treatment for phlegm should distinguish between deficiency and excess. If qi is not significantly deficient, and phlegm is produced from either cold or heat, one should use Liu&#39;an Decoction or Erchen Decoction. If fire is the cause of phlegm, Qingge Drink, Bamboo Juice, or children&#39;s urine should be used. With severe fire, the Chouxin Drink is appropriate. For those with spleen deficiency and a tendency to vomit with excessive phlegm, Liu Junzi Decoction or Wumei Yigong Powder should be considered. If there is insufficient yin energy, with abundant phlegm and dryness accompanied by thirst, Jinshui Liu Jun Decoction is recommended. For yin deficiency leading to water overflowing as phlegm, one can take Liuwei Wan or Bawei Wan in appropriate doses, or prepare them as soups. If phlegm is produced due to the spleen and kidneys being deficient, cold, and unable to transform, one need not treat both phlegm and qi, but should rather focus on warming and strengthening the roots. If there is a deficiency of middle qi, Lichong Decoction or Wengwei Drink is suitable. For those with insufficient yin, the treatment should prioritize decoctions for nourishing yin.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber - Chen Tuduo (Qing Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phlegm Disease</strong></p>
<p>The treatment of phlegm involves the obstruction of phlegm between the throat and the windpipe. Although it seems trivial, it can lead to serious health issues, which is why the ancients established a separate approach for its treatment. However, the methods created focus only on the symptoms of phlegm and do not address its root cause. Therefore, the Erchen Decoction was established to treat both recent and chronic illnesses, yet it proves ineffective. I now propose three formulations: one for newly occurring phlegm, one for phlegm in existing illnesses, and one for phlegm in long-standing conditions. Although phlegm diseases are numerous, they do not transcend our scope of treatment. For early onset, the symptoms of wind-cold, cough, and phlegm are present. Use equal parts of Banxia, Chenpi, Tianhuafen, Fuling, Gancao, and Suzi, each weighing ten grams, and decoct in water for consumption. After two doses, the phlegm will dissipate; this formula eliminates phlegm from the upper jiao. The phlegm in the upper jiao originates from the stomach rather than the lungs. By removing the phlegm from the stomach, the lung&#39;s metal energy is restored, preventing any rise of fire. For phlegm in existing diseases, it resides in the middle jiao, and one must observe its color, distinguishing between white and yellow distinctly. Yellow indicates the fire has begun to recede, while white shows the fire is still rampant.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>For excessive heat, it is appropriate to use cool and cold substances; when the heat is receding, it is advisable to add herbs that dispel it. I now prescribe a formula that can treat both conditions: three qian of white atractylodes, three qian of white mustard seed, five qian of polyporus, one qian each of dried tangerine peel and licorice, one qian of gardenia for phlegm, and five fen of bitter orange, to be decocted in water and taken. This formula is a remedy to strengthen the spleen, not specifically for dispelling phlegm. However, the accumulation of phlegm is often due to dampness in the spleen. By strengthening the spleen, the dampness will descend, and if the dampness does not remain in the spleen, where will it rise from? Moreover, with the addition of a remarkable remedy for dispelling phlegm, can the phlegm remain restless and persist? As for phlegm from prolonged illness, one must not equate it with phlegm due to spleen dampness. Prolonged illness invariably leads to depletion of kidney water; if the kidney water does not rise to become phlegm, then the fire in the kidney boiling can also manifest as phlegm. Thus, for phlegm from chronic illness, one should tonify the kidneys to dispel it. The formula includes five qian each of cooked rehmannia, coix seed, and foxnut, three qian each of cornelian cherry, ophiopogon, polyporus, and Chinese yam, one qian each of northern five-flavor fruit and plantago seeds, and three fen of alpinia galanga, decocted in water and taken. This remedy is particularly effective for phlegm caused by kidney water rising. If the phlegm is due to boiling fire, add one qian of cinnamon.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>This formula is remarkable for its ability to nourish the kidneys while also eliminating dampness and transforming phlegm. When water enters the kidney palace, it is transformed into true essence; how can it rise and become phlegm? This is a method for treating phlegm in the lower jiao. With these three formulas, we can adjust the dosage according to the symptoms and manage phlegm without further issues. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are two other formulas for treating longstanding phlegm that has become chronic. The formula includes Chaihu and licorice, each one qian; Baijiezi and Yiyiren, each five qian; Fuling and Baishao, each three qian; Chenpi three fen; Danpi two qian; and Tianhuafen eight fen, to be prepared as a decoction. This formula is special because it uses Baijiezi as the sovereign, with Yiyiren and Baishao as ministers, and Chaihu and Huafen as assistants, ensuring that the chronic phlegm has nowhere to hide and is gradually digested. This formula can be taken in eight doses, and it eliminates all chronic phlegm, named Xiaozhuo San.</p>
<p>Another formula is for stubborn phlegm. If it forms lumps and obstructs the throat, it is called stubborn phlegm; if it remains in the chest and does not transform, it is called chronic phlegm. The formula includes Ziwanyuan two qian; Banxia, Beimu, Fuling, Jiegeng, Baizhu, and Shenchu, each three qian; as well as BaiFan and licorice, each one qian, to be prepared as a decoction.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>This prescription is remarkable for using both Fritillaria and Pinellia together; one is dry and the other moist, preventing phlegm from hiding anywhere. Additionally, with the use of white alum to dissolve lumps, and Platycodon and Aster to eliminate邪, Licorice harmonizes the center. Is there anything that will not work like this?</p>
<p>For those suffering from phlegm diseases that do not heal after a long time, take a pig&#39;s lung, five qian of radish seeds, and one tael of white mustard seeds, all ground into a powder. Mix them well and steam in a rice pot until cooked. Eating one portion after a meal will cure you. This method treats phlegm in the upper jiao, especially when decoctions are ineffective, and it is indeed miraculous. It clears out the phlegm that has long resided in the lungs, making it an excellent treatment.</p>
<p>For middle phlegm, the prescription includes three qian each of Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Poria, one qian each of Aconite and Tian Nanxing, and two qian of Pinellia; boil in water to take as a decoction. It will cure immediately upon reaching the throat. Phlegm arises due to the deficiency of qi, and qi deficiency arises from the coldness of the organs. Thus, in the prescription, Ginseng and Atractylodes are used to replenish the vital qi, while Pinellia, Tian Nanxing, and Poria are used to expel phlegm, and Aconite warms the center, which leads to quieting the phlegm sound and clearing the phlegm qi.</p>
<p>If the phlegm enters the upper jiao, causing stagnant lumps that neither rise nor fall, blocking the chest, resulting in shortness of breath, the urge to vomit without success, or the inability to cough it up, the method should then employ Yin Yang water to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>One may use the juice of melon seeds or the herb lungs of wild goose to induce vomiting, but this should only be done if one has phlegm and qi stuck in the chest causing pain. Otherwise, it is absolutely forbidden. The vital energy of a person cannot be harmed; vomiting even once will lead to a cycle of disturbance in the five organs and will definitely shorten life. Therefore, one must first inquire whether the person has chest pain, whether there is a blockage in the qi, whether there is an obstruction in the throat, and whether the phlegm that is expelled is yellow. Only when these conditions are present should one consider using the aforementioned remedy to induce vomiting.</p>
<p>Vomiting should not be taken lightly. If one is unaware of the contraindications and rashly induces vomiting, it will definitely disturb the five organs. One must observe whether the expelled phlegm has a shiny appearance against the wall, akin to the shine of snail saliva, which indicates that it is safe to vomit. All else should be avoided. However, if it is shiny, it does not matter whether the phlegm is located in the upper, middle, or lower parts. This shiny color must wait until the phlegm is dried and identified clearly; it cannot be assumed to be shiny just because it is wet.</p>
<p>When there is both central qi and phlegm, though different in nature, they are essentially both rooted in the deficiency of qi. When qi is deficient, phlegm is naturally abundant; when phlegm is abundant, it inevitably consumes qi, thus they are divided yet fundamentally connected.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Take one tael of ginseng, three qian each of pinellia, poria, and south bitter herb, one qian each of aconite and licorice, and decoct in water to be taken. This will remedy the symptoms of central qi and phlegm. Ginseng is originally a divine agent for the qi, and it is also a marvelous medicine for resolving phlegm. Pinellia and south bitter herb, while being superior in expelling phlegm, also support the righteous qi. Aconite and licorice, one nourishing and one courageous, assist each other to become formidable allies. Used among these three flavors, strengthening the righteous will certainly remove the evil, and resolving phlegm will inevitably benefit the qi. There is a division and combination without an apparent form, an extraordinary uniqueness and marvelous transformation that must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>The treatment of qi is important, as there are many qi disorders; I will discuss the major ones, such as qi counterflow and phlegm obstruction. The obstruction of phlegm is not due to phlegm itself but to the stagnation of qi. If one only addresses phlegm without benefiting the qi, I have not seen phlegm dissipate and the illness alleviate. The formula includes two qian of white atractylodes, three qian of poria, and one qian each of ginseng, aged tangerine peel, trichosanthes root, white mustard seed, szechuan pepper, and perilla seed, along with three lumps of cardamom, decocted in water to be taken. The brilliance of this formula lies in treating phlegm while first regulating the qi. When the qi is smooth, the phlegm becomes active; when the qi flows freely, the moisture circulates, and phlegm will not even arise. This is the appropriate approach to treating qi, and one can immediately gain insight into methods for addressing stagnant qi through a single formula.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>For the condition of qi deficiency with excessive phlegm, the phlegm is fundamentally due to dampness. In treating phlegm, one must not merely eliminate the dampness but should first supplement qi, and then assist with phlegm-resolving ingredients. The formula consists of three qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and poria, five qian of coix, one qian each of shenqu, dried tangerine peel, and licorice, all decocted in water. Although this formula includes pinellia and dried tangerine peel to resolve phlegm, without sufficient ginseng, the phlegm will not dissipate; ginseng aids qi, and ingredients like coix and poria can strengthen the spleen to eliminate dampness. Once the dampness is removed, phlegm will naturally resolve; this is a method for treating qi deficiency.</p>
<p>For cases of qi deficiency with cold phlegm, simply add three qian of cinnamon and half a qian of dried ginger to the previous formula. For cases of qi deficiency with heat phlegm, one should not use the previous formulation but instead employ three qian each of lianhua, white peony, and angelica; one qian each of tianhuafen, licorice, dried tangerine peel, and white mustard seed; and two qian of poria, along with three fen of shenqu, all decocted in water. The efficacy of this formulation lies in its ability to avoid excessive dryness while also supplementing qi; it moistens and transforms phlegm, so when phlegm is expelled, qi will naturally become sufficient as well. With these two formulations, treating qi deficiency will be no challenge.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>If there is a rise of kidney water leading to excessive phlegm, one should use the Six-Flavor Decoction with the additions of aconite and cinnamon, prepared as a decoction and consumed in several bowls for recovery. In cases of deficiency of kidney water and kidney fire, even if there are signs of heat in the upper jiao, the tongue remains slippery and not dry, unlike the dryness associated with the extreme heat in yang conditions. </p>
<p>Fat individuals tend to have phlegm, which results from qi deficiency; when qi is deficient, it cannot move, causing phlegm to accumulate. Therefore, treating phlegm must also involve tonifying qi while simultaneously eliminating the phlegm. However, when tonifying qi, one must not solely focus on strengthening the spleen and stomach; it should also include augmenting the fire of the Mingmen (Gate of Vitality). Fire generates earth, and earth produces qi; when qi is ample, phlegm will naturally dissipate. Not treating phlegm directly is part of treating phlegm. </p>
<p>The prescription includes three taels each of ginseng, eucommia bark, and white mustard seed; five taels each of white atractylodes, coix seed, and fox nut; eight taels of cooked rehmannia; four taels of shan yue; two taels each of cinnamon and poria; five qian of cardamom; and one tael each of Alpinia fruit and dried tangerine peel, all ground into powder and mixed with honey to form pills, taken with five qian of boiling water each day. </p>
<p>The effectiveness of this formula lies in cinnamon, which tonifies the fire of the Mingmen and heart protector. When the fire in the heart protector is sufficient, it can stimulate appetite and eliminate phlegm; when the fire of the Mingmen is strong, it can invigorate the spleen and eliminate dampness. Moreover, the ingredients in this formula are primarily tonifying to the heart and kidneys, and cinnamon among these tonifying herbs promotes harmony between heaven and earth. With the water returning to the channels, where would phlegm accumulate? This is the method for treating fat individuals.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Ancient and Modern Writings: Complete Record of the Medical Section, Volume 240</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: The method of guiding phlegm and fire involves stretching the legs while sitting firmly, using both hands to perform the Child’s Method, applying force to lift up, lowering the head and bending the body, then pulling back the toes three times. As with the method, exert force to rise, swallow saliva, and lower it into the mysterious gate, bending up twenty-four times, and then maintaining the practice afterwards. </p>
<p>In practicing the technique, achieve tranquility by using the sixteen-character phrase to guide the swallow at noon, focusing on the navel and keeping thoughts present. Next, practice the tailbone movements eight or nine times; entering tranquility naturally allows phlegm and fire to descend. For phlegm-related ailments, first concentrate on the area of pain, then push open the large intestine, guiding it towards the valley path to facilitate the flow of qi. </p>
<p>For phlegm in the chest, press both hands below the nipples and knead several times. One must focus and nurture qi, then consciously widen the chest, envisioning the upper jiao qi descending to the lower jiao, thereby allowing the diaphragm to open and phlegm to transform.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rujun Shiqin&quot; states: Guo Jingzhi was ill with lingering fluid for four days, resulting in edema and inability to eat; the legs were swollen and painful, connected to the kidney area. He was first treated with a bitter medication to induce vomiting, and later with boat and vehicle pills, as well as Chuan San to purge, resulting in a quick recovery.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br>In Zhangfeng Village by Tangxi, there was an elderly farmer named Yang who had been suffering from vomiting sour water for more than ten years. Initially, he relied on traditional drinks for relief, but various doctors treated him with drying agents, applied moxibustion and needles to his stomach and navel, yet the sores never healed. A healer used bitter medicine to aid him, and as he spat out thick phlegm, he managed to expel two to three liters of it and laughed as he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman, since her youth, had cried deeply, then drank ice-cold water excessively, leading to a blockage of water at her heart and subsequently to painful discomfort. Doctors all believed it was due to cold accumulation, treating her with warming medicines and prohibiting cold foods. However, just the smell of tea would trigger her symptoms. This lasted for several years, during which she underwent moxibustion and needle treatments, leading to dozens of sores. Over ten years, her urine became reddish-yellow, her bowels constipated, her vision worsened, and she accumulated water which greatly increased, flowing to her sides. People deemed it &quot;water constitution&quot; or &quot;edema disorder.&quot; They applied various rough medicines to penetrate her condition, but her appetite waned over time, and the accumulation persisted, affecting her from her sternum down to her sides and lower abdomen. Whenever she had an episode, pressing her abdomen sounded like water splashing, it became hard and sensitive, with episodes occurring five to seven times a month, sometimes so severe she felt she might die. Medicine became distasteful to her over more than twenty years until she sought the help of a healer.</p>
<p>Upon examining her pulse, he found it deep and slow at the cun position, indicating phlegm in her chest. He first used Gua Ti San to help her expel five to seven liters of phlegm; within a few days, more phlegm and water followed. After several more days, she expelled several more liters. In total, she had three rounds of expulsion and three rounds of sweating, all of the accumulated fluids were eliminated. With a prescription of medicines to disperse dampness and resolve edema, she improved significantly within a month.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>A woman had a hard mass above her navel, as firm as a fist, and pressing on it felt like stone. Everyone thought it was a case of a problematic pregnancy and sought countless remedies, including acupuncture, poisonous drugs, and prayers, all to no avail. One day, a man named Dai examined her and said: &quot;This is cold phlegm.&quot; He checked her pulse and found it deep; surely it was cold phlegm. He used a gourd seed powder to induce vomiting, and she expelled six to seven liters, reducing the mass by more than half. After a few days, she vomited again, producing about two to three liters of frothy, foul-smelling bile resembling chicken yolk. This was repeated three times, after which he adjusted her treatment with ginseng and Wuling powder, and her abdomen returned to normal.</p>
<p>Zhongming&#39;s son had suffered from wind phlegm disease since the age of four, which worsened by fifteen, causing attacks once or twice a month. Each time, he experienced severe headaches, and only after punching out hundreds of times would he expel a cup of yellow-green phlegm. As the years went on, his episodes became more frequent; he saw black spots and would become disoriented for three to four days before recovering. Various doctors prescribed southern star and pinellia herbs to resolve the phlegm, but none were effective. By chance, he met a man named Dai in the southern countryside by the river. Dai used a method to induce sweating with a double solution, followed by a bitter agent to expel phlegm, and the illness improved by eight to nine parts; he continued with the adjusted doses from spring to autumn, and after several treatments, he was completely cured.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>Zhuo County&#39;s Zhou Jing was returning to Luyi from the capital when he became thirsty. He drank too much water and gradually developed swelling. Some suggested using Sanhua Shenyou Pills, but he feared their potency; others recommended Wuling Powder, but it was too mild and ineffective. After several months without results, his limbs and kidneys swelled, and he became constipated. 常仲明 sought treatment from Master Dai, who instructed him to take medicine, but by the time he arrived, he had already passed away. Master Dai said: &quot;In patients with water retention, the condition resembles a flood on a long river—using cups and spoons to remove it is nearly impossible. One must use the methods of the divine Yu to control the water for recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: &quot;Lu An, over seventy years old, had phlegm that was not resolved in his diaphragm, and he had little appetite. Initially, it was not serious, but upon consulting doctors in Jingkou, he was prescribed Yue Ju Pills and Qing Qi Hua Tan Pills. His chest felt slightly more at ease, and he continued to take them daily without stopping for over a year, becoming increasingly worn out. When he rented a boat to come for my consultation, his flesh had greatly wasted away, and his pulse felt like floating silk, with the Tai Xi pulse completely absent. Seeing my troubled expression, he said: &#39;I too believe I will inevitably die, but the bloating in my diaphragm is unbearable, and my constipation is severe. If I could just feel relief for a moment, I would die with my eyes closed.&#39; Pressured by his dire state, I prescribed a strong formula. Despite the emotional struggle of being close relatives, I advised using a large dose of ginseng and white atractylodes decoction. Shortly thereafter, he went to the toilet and expelled several liters of accumulated phlegm, feeling relief and comfort in his chest. However, a few days later, he passed away.&quot;<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>The &quot;Orthodox Transmission of Medicine&quot; states: My niece-in-law, Mrs. He, while at home, in April, due to excessive eating of green plums, developed a phlegm and fluid illness. During the day, she experienced intense pain in the chest and diaphragm, as if pierced by knives, which ceased by evening; however, her knees were in severe pain, likely due to the phlegm and fluid rising and falling with respiration. One physician diagnosed it as a cold stomach condition and treated it with dried ginger, ginger, cinnamon, aconite, rhizome, and other herbs, along with a pepper porridge, which worsened her condition, increasing her thirst and causing frequent urination. </p>
<p>Seeking my treatment, I diagnosed her pulse as strong, rapid, and slippery. I formulated a treatment to clear phlegm and instructed her to cook bamboo sap urgently. After three days, her thirst diminished, and her urination improved, but the pain in her chest and knees persisted as before. I gave her half a bowl of juice from radish seeds, resulting in the expulsion of about half a liter of phlegm. </p>
<p>That night, the pain intensified, reflecting the unrest mentioned by Danxi about the rebellious nature of the illness. The next day, I administered one ounce of ginseng and prepared a decoction with reverse flowing water, which did not induce vomiting. The following day, I provided a decoction of bitter fleece-flower root, which also failed to induce vomiting, and then gave her a combination of aconite and platycodon radix, which still did not cause vomiting. One morning, I used one qian of processed villous green plant and added a small amount of musk, mixing it with sour juice for her to take, resulting in a significant vomiting episode. By the next morning, her vomiting stabilized. Over this time, she expelled a small bucket&#39;s worth of stubborn phlegm and thick fluid, and her pain was alleviated. Subsequently, I used soft porridge to treat and soothe her.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Liu Yuanwai, who lived in colorful silk, suffered from typhoid for six or seven days, unable to sleep day and night. Whenever he managed to sleep, he would quickly wake up, and as soon as he got up, he would fall down, never having a moment&#39;s rest. He felt tired of this state and called for his servant, who said: &quot;If this is due to qi, there should be panting; but now there are no such symptoms, so it is not qi.&quot; At that time, cold sweat appeared on his body, his pulse was deep in all positions, and the pulse at the Guān point was also deep. Upon further examination, the beating under the fingers revealed that phlegm was accumulated and cold had gathered in his chest. Thus, I used three ingredients: one ounce each of dried tangerine peel, pinellia, and dried ginger. I chopped them up, crushed half an ounce of ginger, added two bowls of water, and decocted it until there was one and a half bowls remaining, then strained it and divided it into two doses. After taking the medicine for a while, he finally slept, and did not wake for an entire day and night. When he regained consciousness, he expelled a lump of phlegm about the size of an egg, and thereafter the phlegm was resolved. Generally, in cases of phlegm, cold sweating is always present; this is its proof.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Traditional Medicine&quot; states: The head of the Ministry of Justice, Xu Ling, was overworked and angry, causing his spirit to become dull and fatigued, sweating profusely as if bathed, with incoherent speech, in a state of extreme danger. I was called to treat him. Upon examining his pulse, it was large, slippery, and soft, indicating a deficiency of qi accompanied by phlegm. I prescribed a dose of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding four packets of ingredients; using one tael of ginseng, one qian of prepared aconite, and three qian of prepared pinellia. After four days, he showed slight improvement; I then used the Six Gentleman Decoction with ginger juice, and after taking it for several days, combined it with the Eight Flavor Pill, adjusting his treatment over two months, he recovered.</p>
<p>Hanlin scholar Li Ji suffered from excessive fatigue, became drunk, causing internal distress, sweating profusely with much phlegm. He took medicine to relax the diaphragm and transform phlegm, but felt more stagnant and uncomfortable. Upon examining his pulse, it was deep and thin, especially at the chi position. I told his son-in-law Yang Yuanrun: &quot;Phlegm with a thin pulse indicates a difficulty in recovery. Moreover, the deep thin pulse at the chi position is a sign of damage to the essence; it cannot be treated according to standard practices.&quot; Yuanrun insisted on administering the remedy, and reluctantly used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction combined with pinellia and poria, which yielded minor effects. Everyone was pleased. I remarked: &quot;The thin pulse remains unchanged, the pulse method has no foundation; the end is near.&quot; Indeed, over ten days later, he passed away.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br>Literature tells of Zhu Wen, who was plagued by insect-like pains throughout his body, his mouth and tongue rotten. Each morning, he would see two ghosts, who presented him with food while weeping, saying: &quot;I am not yet thirty, and my elderly parents still live; these two ghosts torment me day and night, leaving me no chance of life. If I could summon the strength of the heavens to avoid death, I would be akin to the people of Qin and Yue today.&quot; Thus, he knocked his head until it bled. I examined his pulse, which fluctuated between strong and weak, suspecting it was due to ghostly influence. Upon closely observing, I found his two pulses slippery and large, concluding it was a illness caused by phlegm and fluid. I administered three qian of medicine for phlegm. Though it produced slight results, his condition remained unchanged; I then gave him two qian of small stomach pills, which expelled over ten bowls of phlegm and fluid, reducing his pain by half. By morning, the ghosts were gone. I subsequently boiled three qian of ginseng and two qian of white atractylodes, and after taking three qian of small stomach pills, he had a massive discharge of over ten movements, amounting to about twenty bowls, and his illness vanished. Finally, I used Six Gentleman pills, and after taking four jins, he was cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: Hong Mai said: Mai had phlegm illness, and upon facing the night, sent a messenger with instructions: chew three walnuts and three slices of ginger while lying down, and drink two or three sips of soup; then chew the walnuts and ginger again as before, and remain quietly lying down for certain recovery. When Mai returned to Yu Tang and followed these instructions, by morning his phlegm dissipated and his cough ceased.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>Li Yang&#39;s young son was afflicted with phlegm and wheezing, not nursing or eating for five days and nights, and the doctor warned that it was critical. That night, his wife dreamed of Guanyin, who gave her a decoction of ginseng and walnut. Li hurriedly obtained about an inch of ginseng from Silla and one walnut, brewed them in a clam shell&#39;s worth of water, and administered it; the wheezing immediately ceased. The next day, after removing the walnut&#39;s skin and using it again, the wheezing returned. Using it with the skin still attached, he trusted the remedy overnight and was cured. This remedy is not included in any texts. It is said that ginseng calms wheezing, and walnut with the skin can consolidate lung function.</p>
<p>Zhong Cung&#39;s son, Zhang Zheng, struggled with phlegm, suffering from symptoms similar to colds or changes in weather whenever he ate until full, experiencing headaches and chills, with sour vomiting every ten days. He would lie down for several days without food; medicines provided no relief. In the early years of Xuanhe, while serving in Shunchang, he obtained a recipe for a Dan from Wu, and after taking it, he never experienced those symptoms again. Whenever he overindulged in food and felt full, he would take five to seventy pills, which sufficed. Shortly after, his urination carried the scent of evodia, and all alcoholic drinks left with his urine. He tried many phlegm remedies previously, none compared to this. He soaked Wu Zhu Yu (evodia) in water seven times, ground it with poria into a powder, and mixed it with honey into walnut-sized pills; he took fifty of them with warm water. The Mei Yangqing formula only used evodia, soaked in wine for three nights, and mixed with powdered poria, dried in the sun, swallowing a hundred pills each day with warm wine.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: Scholar Wu Beichuan experienced excessive drinking leading to phlegm accumulation, with a stiff tongue base. After taking medicine to eliminate heat and transform phlegm, the phlegm condition worsened, and his limbs became unresponsive. I diagnosed it as spleen deficiency with damp-heat and treated him, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Grand Counselor Li Beiquan had persistent phlegm expectoration, internal heat causing thirst, and body fatigue with resulting foot heat. After using medicine to clear qi and transform phlegm, his condition worsened. I suggested that this was due to kidney water overflowing and causing phlegm, so he needed to tonify the kidneys. Skeptical, he insisted on taking more phlegm-dispelling pills. He experienced continuous vomiting and diarrhea, could not eat, and his head felt heavy with closed eyes. Finally, he believed me. I then prescribed several doses of Liu Junzi Decoction to stabilize his stomach qi and followed with Liu Wei Wan for over a month, leading to the complete resolution of all symptoms.</p>
<p>Elder Liang Houzhai had shortness of breath with phlegm, red and painful urination, heel pain, and a floating and large pulse that felt weak upon palpation. This was a case of kidney deficiency with phlegm accumulation. I administered Si Wu Decoction combined with Liu Wei Wan, and he recovered in less than a month. As taught by Master Zhang Zhongjing, when there is qi deficiency with phlegm, one should use Kidney Qi Pills to tonify and eliminate it. Truly, it enlightens the ignorant and rescues the constrained. The Kidney Qi Pill is indeed the Liu Wei Wan.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>Du Xian Meng had a shortness of breath with a lot of phlegm, leading to urinary issues, with a significant swelling that felt like there was nothing there when pressed. I believed that the kidney function was incapable of properly taking in breath, and the strong aromatic herbs exacerbated the issue. Using the Ba Wei pill in three doses cured him.</p>
<p>Gao Tong Shi was drinking at the ZHOU Shang She residence and asked me: &quot;Meng Youya and Chen Donggu both had no offspring and then fell ill, resulting in vomiting phlegm; both used Suhe Xiang pills, yet only Youya survived. Why is that?&quot; I replied: &quot;Both cases stem from kidney deficiency that cannot take in breath, leading to head wind and the inability to control water, resulting in phlegm. Donggu emphasized treating phlegm to move qi, while Youya focused on supporting fire and tonifying qi.&quot; Later, at the request of a Hangzhou person, after Gao Tong Shi overworked himself, he experienced similar symptoms. Using methods to clear qi and transform phlegm made him worse. He remarked: &quot;My illness is due to kidney deficiency that cannot return breath to its source.&quot; Unfortunately, the physician did not realize it and he passed away, what a pity!</p>
<p>One man had a preference for rich food and suffered from chest fullness and excessive phlegm. I said: &quot;A person with rich diet tends to accumulate heat.&quot; I prescribed the Qing Qi Hua Tan pill and he was cured. This was effective and showed that those with weak spleen and stomach would inevitably suffer.</p>
<p>My older brother had a robust appearance but produced much phlegm. His pulse was strong and full, yet he could not endure exertion, often experiencing a head wind that made him faint, and had oral sores that would sometimes become red and ulcerated. After mistakenly eating a little ginger and garlic, his mouth sores worsened. He took the Ba Wei pill and added a tonifying midsection and qi with Fu Zi, and he recovered. After stopping the medication for over a month, the symptoms recurred. This indicated a deficiency of the life gate fire that did not return to its source, so he continued taking the previous medicine and was cured again.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br>A scholar experienced labor and then had little appetite, felt a tightness in the chest, developed a fever and headache, coughed up phlegm, and felt thirsty, with a pulse that was floating and large. I believed this was due to a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi and related to a blood condition. When I was not believed, he took herbs like Erchen and Siwu, Huangbo, and Zhimu, resulting in abdominal pain and vomiting, with a pulse that was surging, rapid, and disordered. Initially, I prescribed Liu Junzi Decoction with roasted ginger, and his pain and vomiting gradually improved. I followed up with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he fully recovered.</p>
<p>Scholar Xu Yan had a dry mouth and phlegm, wanting to take Qiongyu Paste. I advised him that this was a remedy to subdue yin and lower fire. He had a pale face, dry mouth, and phlegm, suggesting a deficiency of spleen and lung qi; thus, he should use warming and tonifying remedies. He did not believe me and insisted on taking it. After more than two months, he had loose stools, little appetite, and also developed impotence; only then did he start to believe my words. I first used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Poria and Banxia to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach. Gradually, his appetite increased, and his stools became firmer. After stopping those two herbs and taking the formula for over a month, he fully recovered; moreover, after taking Liuwei Dihuang Wan for more than three months, his condition returned to normal. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Qiongyu Paste, Guben Wan, and Kanli Wan are all remedies for reducing cold and lowering fire; they should not be taken by those whose intestines and stomach are not dry and hot. If someone with yin deficiency in the three yin channels takes them for a long time, it may render them childless. This is because it depletes their yang qi, resulting in insufficient yin blood for generation, as has been repeatedly observed.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>Within Yangshan, the individual is prone to anger, experiences discomfort in the chest, produces excessive phlegm, swallows sour and putrid substances, has diminished appetite, and feels heat in the hands and feet. The medications taken are not likely to be for clearing heat such as Chuanqionghua and Zhi Shi, but should instead include ingredients like Bingsu and Houpo. The left pulse is strong and full, while the right is weak and rapid. I believe this indicates liver fire and blood dryness, with wood overpowering earth. </p>
<p>In the morning, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the liver wood; in the evening, employ Liu Junzi Decoction with added Donggui and Shaoyao to tonify the spleen earth. Recovery should occur in less than a month. However, if anger arises again, the previous ailment may reoccur. One might take Er Chen Tang with Gypsum, leading to a surge of saliva, external heat resembling burning, and a strong, large pulse that feels empty upon pressure. I argue that the spleen governs saliva, and its deficiency leads to heat and excessive salivation.</p>
<p>Using Liu Junzi with Ginger and Cinnamon will allow for immediate sleep, resulting in the sudden disappearance of all symptoms, with a few doses leading to recovery. However, if one takes medications for regulating qi or transforming phlegm, symptoms such as abdominal distension, shortness of breath, leg swelling, knee edema, and dripping may develop. In emergencies, use Jisheng Jiajian Shenqi Wan for rescue, which often saves many lives.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br>A man experienced reduced appetite, a feeling of fullness in his chest, coldness in his hands and feet, aversion to cold foods, fever, sputum, and occasional nausea. He self-administered a remedy to clear phlegm but found his chest and abdomen more distended, breathing hindered, and continued to spit up phlegm and vomit food, with urine being scant and dribbling. He then tried a formula like Wuling San, but urination was still difficult and all his ailments worsened. I said: This is due to a deficiency and coldness in the spleen&#39;s earth element, with no fire present; therefore, food cannot be digested and instead is regurgitated, not caused by qi obstruction. I prescribed Bawei Wan, supplemented with Zhongyiqi and added Banxia, Fuling, Ginger, and Cinnamon. He recovered in ten days.</p>
<p>Another man, robust and fond of drinking, had a strong root of the tongue, spoke with difficulty due to phlegm obstruction, and had a crooked mouth and eyes, with limbs not functioning properly. I diagnosed this as due to spleen deficiency with damp heat and phlegm accumulation. I treated him with Liujunzi Decoction, adding dry ginger, Shan Zhi, and Shen Qu, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A young official named Li had tinnitus from anger, experienced phlegm and nausea, could not eat, and suffered cold and hot pain in his side.

He took medicine to resolve phlegm and promote qi, but felt full in the chest and his abdomen swelled, with phlegm increasing. He then took medicine to guide phlegm and regulate the spleen, but his belly expanded, and he had difficulty with urination and defecation. After that, he took medicine to disperse qi and relieve water retention; his abdomen became large, and he had pain in the sides, preventing him from sleeping. Upon taking medicine to break blood and guide out, he had swelling in both legs and his pulses were large at the joints, but weak at the inch pulse. I diagnosed his condition as phlegm caused by spleen deficiency and prescribed modified Kidney Qi Pills in the morning and tonic decoction in the evening. After a month, his symptoms gradually improved, and he could eat more. Then, I prescribed Eight Flavor Pills and the tonic decoction again. After another month, he could turn over, and in two months, he was able to walk. Eventually, he took Complete Qi Tonic Decoction and a rejuvenating pill, and after half a year, he fully recovered. Later, if he lost regulation slightly, his abdomen would swell again, but taking the previous medicine would cure him.</p>
<p>My old colleague Qian Kejiu, who enjoyed drinking, had a red face and excessive phlegm, with unformed stools. I considered his condition as damp phlegm stagnating in the intestines and stomach, so I prescribed a formula including Erchen, Qinjiao, Lian, Shan Zhi, Zhishi, Gande, Zexie, and Shengma. He coughed up a lot of phlegm, and his stool became firm. After that, he drank a decoction of Huanglian three qian daily and felt at ease.</p>
<p>Heng Jincheng also had a red face, coughed up phlegm, and occasionally experienced diarrhea. I prescribed something similar to Erchen, Huanglian, and Zhishi, but it did not work for him. I felt his pulse; the left guan was tense, and the right guan was large, indicating that kidney water was carrying liver wood, overpowering spleen earth. If he did not believe this, later he succumbed to dysentery from summer fruits and passed away.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br>In the official residence, Shen Wenji’s mother ate damp noodles, suffered from sourness and vomiting, and refused to eat. After taking herbal formulas such as Qinjian, she experienced cold and heat, dry mouth, and drooling; she then ate a piece of winter melon, which intensified her vomiting. I assessed that her spleen was weak and cold. I urgently applied a warm poultice of salt, mugwort, and aconite to her navel and abdomen. Additionally, her son inhaled her breath to connect with her spirit, which slightly revived her. I ground ginseng, poria, aconite, and dried tangerine peel into powder and formed pills the size of millet, instructing her to swallow five to seven pills, increasing to more than ten the next day. Gradually, she took one or two spoonfuls of decoction and craved porridge to drink. After over fifty doses of ginseng and poria, she recovered.</p>
<p>A scholar suffered from a persistent cough with excessive phlegm, discomfort in the chest and abdomen, little appetite, fatigue in his limbs, and a pulse that was floating and large yet weak upon pressure. After taking Erchen decoction and bitter orange, the phlegm became worse. I suggested that he had deficiencies in the spleen, lungs, and kidneys. By administering the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman with weak spleen and stomach, who had little appetite, suddenly experienced phlegm obstructing her breath, shaking her head and eyes, and throwing her hands and feet, making it hard to take her pulse. Observing her complexion, which was yellow with a hint of blue, showed that the liver&#39;s wood element was overwhelming her spleen and stomach. After treating her with the Six Gentlemen decoction, adding Bupleurum and Cimicifuga, she revived and further used Bu Zhong Yi Qi plus Pinellia for recovery.</p>
<p>A man commonly had phlegm and worsened it with anger, feeling fullness and obstruction in his chest. This indicated that the liver&#39;s wood was constraining the spleen&#39;s earth. After using the Six Gentlemen with cardamom for treatment, he was cured.</p>
<p>A woman, generally feeling oppressed, found her chest tight and vomited thick phlegm like glue. She was cured by taking the modified Gui Pi decoction.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>A woman coughed up phlegm accompanied by a greenish-yellow discharge.

<p>Another woman, whose vital energy was naturally weak, experienced phlegm and qi disruptions, with symptoms like discomfort in the throat and chest fullness. I believed it to be due to stress harming her spleen, so I treated her with a modified Gui Pi Tang, and she recovered. Later, encountering anger, her previous symptoms recurred. Confused by various opinions, she thought it was due to phlegm and hastily used phlegm-dispelling medications, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea, altering her symptoms to a state of silence and unconsciousness. I believed this to be a further injury to her spleen and stomach, so for daily use, I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang with a strong decoction of rice, which she took in teaspoon amounts. After four days, she gradually advanced to porridge, and then took her previous medicine, alternating with Gui Pi Tang. I was pleased with her good care, and after more than two months, all her symptoms completely resolved.</p>
<p>Jin Yi Yang Yongxing suffered from soft, painful muscles and bones, with coarse qi and abundant phlegm, leading to thirst and a desire for water. Treatments such as Yu Feng Tang and Tian Ma Wan exacerbated the phlegm and caused numbness. I diagnosed it as deficiency in both spleen and kidney, so I treated him with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and a modified Ba Wei Wan. After three months, he was cured.</p>
<p>Zhou Pan Jiang Dayong, fifty years old, was robust but felt fullness and phlegm, with headaches upon exertion. He had only taken medications to clear phlegm and regulate qi. I remarked that fullness indicated a deficiency of spleen qi; excessive phlegm meant the spleen could not move it; headaches indicated the spleen&#39;s qi could not rise; and numbness suggested deficiency in the spleen&#39;s ability to circulate. Thus, I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Fu Ling and Ban Xia to nourish the spleen, along with Ba Wei Wan to support the spleen mother, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br>A scholar had a deficiency in the spleen and kidneys, accompanied by phlegm. He attempted to resolve the phlegm, which led to great thirst and a feeling of heat and discomfort in the head. I determined that it was a case of weak central qi causing a transformation of symptoms, and treated him with a formula to replenish the central qi and enhance energy, resulting in recovery. Later, he exerted himself and developed a fever and discomfort in the head; I believed the qi was too weak to rise. I used the previous formula and added vitex to help him recover. Afterward, he became mentally fatigued and was averse to wind and cold, with reversed cold in the limbs, excessive phlegm saliva in his mouth. I diagnosed this as a true case of spleen deficiency and cold, and treated him with a modification of the Six Gentleman Decoction by adding roasted ginger and cinnamon, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A man with a chronic kidney deficiency and phlegm cough also employed methods to resolve phlegm, which led to all the signs of deficiency. Phlegm saliva surged upward, and he experienced frequent urination. I diagnosed it as a depletion of the three yin meridians that had worsened. In the morning, I administered a tonic to nourish the spleen qi, and in the evening, I prescribed a formula of six flavor pills with added five-flavor fruit to consolidate and preserve the essence, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Zhang Yu, a successful scholar, faced stagnation in digestion, a feeling of fullness in the chest, and phlegm. He considered using medicine to resolve this, but the phlegm surged upward, leading to dizziness, feelings of heat, thirst, constipation, a preference for cold food and drinks, and heat in the hands and feet. I inferred that his kidney water was weak, making it difficult for fluids to descend. The spoiled fluids became phlegm, and I treated him with six flavor pills, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A 75-year-old man experienced widespread pain, particularly in the muscles and bones, with an inability to bend or stretch. He had dry mouth, red eyes, dizziness, phlegm surging, obstructed chest, red and scanty urination, and particularly severe phlegm heat at night, leading to itching all over his body as if insects were crawling. I diagnosed this as dryness in the liver channel causing wind movement.

<p>The official Qian Xian had a sour feeling in his chest and fullness, accompanied by excessive phlegm and diarrhea, with little appetite. After taking phlegm-relieving medicine, his symptoms worsened, his knees gradually swelled, and there were alternating chills and fever. I concluded that it was a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, with damp-heat descending. I prescribed an enhanced version of the Ren Shen and Bai Zhu in the Ba Zhen Decoction, adding Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and roasted ginger, and he recovered.</p>
<p>My nephew Fan Yundike experienced a cough with abundant phlegm, discomfort in his chest and abdomen, poor appetite, fatigue, and a floating and large pulse that felt weak upon pressure. He took Er Chen Tang with Zhi Ke, which made the phlegm worse.

His left pulse was long and wiry with no strength upon pressing, while his right pulse was also long and wiry but weak. This indicated wood overcoming earth; he was treated with the Six Gentleman’s Decoction supplemented with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Mu Xiang, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A certain Confucian scholar was corpulent and suffered from phlegm and wheezing in mid-summer, using Er Chen, Qin, Lian, and Jie Geng which aggravated his phlegm and wheezing. After adding Sang Pi, Xing Ren, and (Cao She) Lou, he experienced night sweats and shortness of breath. Adding Bei Mu and Zhi Gu, he suffered from intermittent fever, a gradual decrease in appetite, and a large but weak pulse. I diagnosed it as a deficiency of the spleen and lungs, hence I administered the Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to tonify the earth mother, along with the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Benefit Qi to restore the central qi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another official, Chen Zi Zhong, had little appetite and a dry mouth with sputum. He frequently took Er Chen, Zhi Shi, and Huang Lian, which damaged his spleen and stomach, so he consulted me. I referred to Master Dong Yuan&#39;s words: in cases of the spleen and stomach, if there is excess, then Zhi Shi and Huang Lian should be purged; if there is deficiency, then Bai Zhu and Chen Pi should be used to tonify. He subsequently mixed the two flavors equal in parts into pills for regular consumption. As a result, he could eat plenty without harm and was not hungry at mealtime.</p>
<p>A certain Confucian scholar had a weak spleen qi and suffered from vomiting and sputum due to anger, which caused a bloated chest and abdomen, little appetite, and a long and wiry left pulse that was weak upon pressing, with a long and wiry right pulse that was slightly weak.

<p>A woman experienced coughing with phlegm and pain in her chest, with a floating and slippery pulse at the right wrist, and tightness in the neck. This was due to heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach producing phlegm, not a lung abscess. She was treated with the Erchen Decoction, adding gardenia, white attractor, and platycodon, and she recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Guidelines&quot; states: A woman aged twenty, somewhat overweight and quick-tempered, after being angry, developed a cough with phlegm and nausea. She was given the Erchen Decoction with additional ingredients to soothe the qi, reduce fire, and resolve phlegm. It was as if throwing water against a stone; gradually she coughed violently, making strange noises day and night without pause. The ancients referred to “coughing reversely” as a series of fifty or seventy sounds in quick succession, or sometimes thirty or fifty. This case involved continuous sound without end, which seemed indicative of severe illness. Her pulse was floating and slightly surging, with a sinking, slightly slippery touch. I decided to give her a rolling phlegm pill, but it had no effect. I believed phlegm was stagnant between the stomach and chest, preventing the qi from flowing. Only through coughing could it be expelled, so I used a preparation of melon stem powder mixed with sour jujube water, using a goose feather to help induce vomiting, resulting in a bowlful of phlegm being expelled, and her cough ceased, silent and effective.</p>
<p>After two days, due to eating noodles and meat sauce, she again developed coughing and regurgitation. I gave her clear phlegm and qi-soothing medicine, but it did not work. I reasoned that the phlegm she had expelled the previous day was not fully eliminated, so she needed to vomit again. After another effort, she expelled about half a bowl of phlegm and was then cured.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a><br>A man over forty years old, stout in build, often burdened by fatigue and phlegm heat. One day, he first felt cold, then developed a fever, experiencing slight head pain, frequent dizziness, as if he could not bear the weight, and restless heat that did not subside. He tried to sweat it out with a ginseng and perilla drink, but it did not help and sought treatment. Upon examining his pulse, it was deep, surging, and slippery. I concluded there was definitely phlegm-heat stagnation. I prescribed a modified Er Chen decoction with Scutellaria, Phragmites, Gastrodia, and the excrement of ferment, along with pill to expel phlegm. However, the next day, he still had restless heat and persistent coughing with phlegm. This is precisely what Danxi said: when phlegm is in the diaphragm, it must be vomited; it cannot be expelled by purging. I used Gua Ti San to induce vomiting and gathered about half a bowl of phlegm, but he stopped out of fear of bitterness. I felt that the small amount of phlegm was insufficient to be effective; the restless heat remained the same. However, with a combination of Ginseng Bai Hu Decoction and Wuling San, he still did not improve. I said: the stagnation is heavy, making it hard to vomit it out, and purging does not relieve it, so a remedy to disperse the stagnation is needed. I then used a modified Er Chen with Qian Hu, Chai Hu, Ge Gen, Jie Geng, Cang Zhu, Chuan Xiong, and ginger juice-fried Scutellaria and Gardenia. After three doses, he was cured.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: Mr. Qian Shuweng, an elderly gentleman, has a thin physique and usually has a lot of heat and little phlegm. In recent years, the heat within him has combined with humidity to produce phlegm. In the autumn of the Xin Si year, with a mixture of dampness and heat, he suddenly suffered from numbness in his right foot, feeling as cold as ice or stone. This was due to extreme heat manifesting as cold, similar to the summer months when rain and hail occur. The doctors, observing the coldness of his foot, did not discern that it was extreme heat resembling cold, mistakenly prescribed warming herbs such as cowherb, papaya, and others; they furthermore believed that his lower energy was depleted, wrongly using warming tonics like cinnamon and aconite.</p>
<p>By adding fire to fire and heat to heat, his condition worsened, leading to swelling and discharge of pus. Over several months, it spread down to the ankle bones, causing swelling in the back of the foot and toes, rendering them unusable. This was entirely due to mismanagement of treatment. The reasoning is quite clear and not difficult to differentiate. If it were just cold phlegm sinking down, it would merely cause hardening and not dispersing; at worst, it would lead to weakness and numbness. How could it result in swelling and pus, with yellow water oozing and decaying flesh penetrating tendons? Mr. Taiweng, unaware of the medical errors, blamed it on the deities in the corners, but could it truly be so? This is not much different from the complications of typhoid where heat invades the meridians and causes flux.</p>
<p>The ginseng paste used only focused on replenishing the vital energy, without any medications to clear and resolve the damp heat, which is why there was no evident resolution of the symptoms.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br>As a senior official, one should not be involved in trivial matters. If ginseng works in harmony with bamboo leaf, ginseng strengthens the meridians, and bamboo leaf opens the collaterals, then their sweet and cold properties would complement each other wonderfully. Master Xu Taiye took ginseng to treat his deficiency wind, but mistakenly combined it with the heat of aconite. To this day, his sinews are shortened and he cannot move freely, which is due to his lack of understanding of how sweet and cold can open the meridians. Moreover, after the old gentleman used ginseng paste, his spleen qi became robust and his digestive function improved. At this time, if he could moderate his diet, allowing the yang qi generated within the spleen to actively dispel phlegm and heat, then the phlegm heat would circulate, and the affliction in his legs could be resolved.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br>On the day of an eclipse, along with night eating, although the spleen&#39;s energy is robust and not harmed by food, it is indeed regrettable that the spleen&#39;s energy, generated by ginseng, is solely used to process food and not to move phlegm or heat. Nowadays, food intake is also difficult to process, which, instead of promoting health, leads to decline, causing phlegm and fluids to accumulate in the chest, resulting in fullness and discomfort, as well as frequent coughing with phlegm not being expelled. This is fundamentally due to the spleen losing its strength, and not because the stomach is able to move fluids; rather, food intake generates phlegm, gradually saturating the lung pathways, making coughing difficult.</p>
<p>Although treating phlegm is urgent, the medicines for phlegm generally exhaust energy and induce deficiency, thus risking that phlegm may not be expelled before pathogenic wind enters. The only proper way is to use sweet and cold medicines to quell wind, dispel heat, moisten dryness, and replenish deficiency, thereby opening phlegm. As for spicy and warming medicines, they must not be mistakenly used again. Physicians clearly see this, yet they continue to use large amounts of cinnamon and other warming agents, presumably thinking them effective because purulent fluid easily dries up, and thus they push vigorously for a resolution. Is this not deserving of condemnation?<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a><br>The old man You is robust and shows vitality, never suffering from illness or invasion of pathogens. However, every morning, he must expel a few mouthfuls of phlegm after bathing his face, habitually rubbing his chest and stimulating the energy beneath his ribs. If he sleeps soundly at night and has clear pathways for water, he feels refreshed in his chest. His symptoms resemble illness but are not truly so. After extensive examination of medical texts and inquiring with knowledgeable doctors, no clear answer could be found. Chang posited that this is phlegm and fluid accumulating in the chest cavity, with a minor stagnation formed due to his vigorous energy, leading to simultaneous gathering and expulsion. Thus, the phlegm and fluid do not cause harm; however, the energy in the chest can be injured by the act of expulsion. The chest region, or “Dan Zhong,” is at the same level as the upper burner. The classics state that the upper burner is like mist, indicating that its energy is diffused like fog. It also states that Dan Zhong is the official in charge of distributing energy within the chest and transmitting it downward. Now, due to frequent expulsions, the diffused energy turns into urgency and ascends, but when settled, it resumes its downward distribution, thus not causing harm. Generally, phlegm is the symptom while energy is the root; treating the symptom is easy, but treating the root is difficult. The difficulty in treating the root lies in the fact that previous sages have never discussed methods for it, leaving later generations unaware of how to treat it. Chang attempted to theorize on this: there are three sources of energy to address: First is lung energy. When lung energy is clear, the body&#39;s energy flows smoothly downward, and the old man’s lung energy is typically clear. Second is stomach energy. When stomach energy is harmonious, the energy within the chest also flows more easily downward, and the old man’s stomach energy is usually harmonious. Third is bladder energy.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>When the energy of the bladder is strong, it can attract the energy within the chest to descend. Therefore, young students should cultivate this energy, which is inherently vigorous. If the energy in the heart region is chaotic, it can be treated immediately; if it is disturbed, it can be calmed right away. This depends on the subtle transport of these three energies, so one does not perceive their burdens, and this is called being free from illness. However, when these three energies oppose the chest diaphragm, the resulting tightness and distension can hardly be tolerated! Thus, undiagnosed illnesses may remain unspoken, but the occurring energies must urgently return to their balance. The patient may feel tormented by phlegm and fluids, attempting to expel the energy through breathing, thereby dislodging phlegm from the chest diaphragm, yet unaware that this phlegm cannot be expelled and only damages the energy. Indeed, at night, phlegm accumulates in the stomach, and upon waking, it can be naturally vomited out; during the day, the stomach&#39;s fluids circulate through the organs, and even if stimulated, they will not be expelled.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br>Thus, when phlegm is resolved, the qi will naturally be smooth; therefore, treating phlegm should be a priority. However, when the body is full of phlegm, it is not easily eliminated, and one must first strengthen the spleen; when the spleen is strong, new phlegm does not form. As for the old phlegm that is lodged in the body&#39;s cavities, it gradually penetrates the stomach and is dispersed both above and below; thus, without phlegm there is no vomiting, without vomiting the qi remains undisturbed, and when the qi is undisturbed, it will gradually return to its harmonious state. Nevertheless, there is still a critical point that must be addressed. The human chest is vast and empty like the great void; when the earth&#39;s qi rises, it becomes clouds. The heavenly qi must descend to become rain, and the earth&#39;s qi then begins to collect and remain still. Indeed, if the upper Jiao is like mist, the middle Jiao like fermentation, and the lower Jiao like a channel, one will understand how clouds move and rain falls, and as a result, all waterways will be filled, and the paths will be cleared, bringing a new scene to the universe. This principle places vital importance on the bladder meridian.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>The classics say: The bladder is the official of the capital region; it stores the fluids, and when Qi is transformed, it can be expelled. Just as a person can drink without limit and not become drunk, this is all due to the Qi transformation of the bladder. The Zang Zhong (the area of the heart) is located within the diaphragm, while the bladder is situated in the abdomen. When the Qi of the bladder transforms, it creates a hollow space that is good for storage, allowing the Qi of the Zang Zhong to descend; if the bladder does not transform, the abdomen will already be distended, making it impossible for the Qi of the Zang Zhong to descend.</p>
<p>However, in order for the bladder&#39;s Qi to transform, its authority lies in preserving the kidneys, as the kidneys regard the bladder as a cavity. When kidney Qi moves, it must first flow into the bladder. If the movement is excessive and persistent, the bladder becomes full and distended, inevitably causing a reverse flow into the chest and diaphragm, resulting in a blockage that cannot be easily described. If the kidney Qi is not active, then its storage becomes firmer, allowing the bladder to remain clear and unaffected, thus the Qi of the Zang Zhong cannot be overfilled.</p>
<p>When the Qi of the Zang Zhong flows downward swiftly, it is not disturbed by the pulls of excess, and the chest feels open as if in the vastness of space. Chang Geng further states: When Qi is flowing smoothly, phlegm does not linger; thus, without treating the phlegm, it eliminates itself. The servant asked: Phlegm in the diaphragm is not far from the throat, and it must cause pain and vomiting each morning; why is this? The answer: It is a difference in pathways. Between the chest and diaphragm lies a thick layer of fatty membranes, completely blocking any gaps; from where can the phlegm escape? What comes out is just the phlegm from the stomach. The servant asked: Then does the phlegm in the diaphragm not come out? The answer: How could it not come out? It is just that expulsion is challenging.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>The Qi of the diaphragm spreads throughout the twelve meridians. When it spreads to the six Yang meridians of the hands and feet, the Qi rises and exits from the throat; when it spreads to the six Yin meridians of the hands and feet, the Qi descends and exits from the front and back Yin. However, the Qi that exits from below is unobstructed, while the Qi that exits from above must first descend to the Yangming before it can rise, which makes it more difficult. It is said that this discussion of the transformation of the bladder Qi is profoundly subtle. Yet, the mechanism of suction is not seen in the classics; could it possibly have a source? It is stated that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; contains the principle of the Greater Yang drawing the essence, but due to the lack of annotations, people cannot comprehend it. The Greater Yang refers to the bladder of the Sun. This means that the bladder can draw down the Qi from the chest, resulting in the dissipation of the distension in the chest, which serves as sufficient proof.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>It is said: The theory of the &quot;cavity in the chest&quot; is indeed certain and without doubt, but one does not know what caused it, where it ends, or when it dissipates. It is said: The Qi of the human body, when abundant, flows into the meridians; when the meridians are abundant, Qi flows into the collaterals. The origin of the cavity begins with phlegm accumulating at the stomach, and during vomiting, the stomach Qi moves several times, with half emerging from the throat and half entering the collaterals. The collaterals of the stomach pass through the diaphragm. When the Qi rushes in urgently, it penetrates the diaphragm, allowing the phlegm to settle there. Once the phlegm has been there for a long time, it obstructs the airway, and the rushing Qi forms another cavity, like a bee&#39;s nest, growing day by day, hence making treatment very difficult. One must first eliminate the phlegm in the stomach without causing vomiting or irritation, so that the Qi of the stomach does not rush into the collaterals, allowing the stomach to become more receptive to the Qi returning from the collaterals. Gradually, using medicine to guide the cavity and clear away the phlegm, healing will occur spontaneously. This understanding is unique to me and has been tested multiple times.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>Huang, my esteemed brother, the lady is suffering from phlegm obstructing the passages. There is stagnation between the liver, lungs, and pericardium; there is weakness in all three pulse sections, with excess evil and deficient righteousness, making it difficult to disperse. If one wishes to use an expelling method to slightly induce a吐 (vomit) of about thirty percent, it would indeed be a relief. However, upon careful consideration, this method is hardly feasible. The expelling technique is like a military tactic, where security and danger are easily reversed; it is inherently perilous. Moreover, phlegm is merely a fleeting disturbance; if we apply expelling medicine, the phlegm may stir and be expelled just as someone is about to address it. However, the point of entry is blocked, and the qi cannot descend. The medicinal effect conflicts with the pathological condition, possibly leading to days of unconsciousness. What can be done? Ultimately, as Danxi stated: if expulsion is feared, should it not be better to nourish and guide it downward? The phlegm in the passages cannot be led downward; it merely consumes the spleen qi, causing further obstruction. This method is not advisable either. For the current plan, it is necessary to focus on nourishing the spleen first. The spleen qi is the yang energy that supports health and movement in the body, much like the sun in the sky. When the yin condenses and blocks, it is as if the sun has lost its position; when phlegm obscures perception, it signifies that the spleen has lost its authority. Nourishing the spleen is akin to the blazing sun at its zenith; can a wisp of cloud obscure it? Next, nothing is better than clearing the lungs.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>The lungs are the organ of the general and commander. When the qi is clear, it will be solemn and descend; when the qi descends, phlegm will serve as a stronghold, illustrating flaws that can be targeted for attack. The saying goes, “To attack the strong, even flaws are strong; to attack flaws, the strong also have flaws.” Now, with the limbs swollen and numb, the qi is extremely stagnant, and it cannot be neglected. </p>
<p>To address this condition, the method concerning the spleen must combine medicine with diet. White rice, fragrant vegetables, and bitter tea are preferable. It is essential to avoid smooth and greasy foods; even porridge should not be consumed, as it tends to form phlegm easily. Not only should mixed foods be avoided, but rice should also be reduced to prevent spleen qi from being used to digest grains; instead, it should be used to eliminate phlegm, which is much more effective than medication.</p>
<p>Spicy, alcoholic, and sun-dried foods all harm the lungs and should be avoided. As for medication, there is a particular order to follow, waiting for gradual improvement and full recovery in the coming spring. Due to this illness, patients do not understand treatment, and the sages of old also did not have superior methods. However, after much thought, I believe the key lies here. </p>
<p>Therefore, those who want to sustain this must agree with the strategies of a fortified city, first eliminating the smaller issues and then eliminating the major ones, as this is not something easily achieved. It is said that the onset of phlegm originates from the liver and gallbladder; in winter, the wood qi returns to its root, preventing aggressive treatment. Thus, we only use spleen-regulating medicines. Only when spring arrives, with the wood qi flourishing, should we employ the Four Gentlemen Decoction, adding gentian, aloe, realgar, coptis, and indigo among other herbs in pill form. This will resolve the symptoms of phlegm obstruction, leading to complete recovery and preventing future occurrences.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　痰饮为患，十人居其七八，《金匮》论文最详，分别而各立其名。后世以其名之多也，徒徇其末而忘其本，曾不思圣人立法，皆从一源而出，无多岐也。盖胃为水谷之海，五脏六腑之大源，饮入于胃，游溢精气，上输于脾，脾气散精，上归于肺，通调水道，下输膀胱，水精四布，五经并行，以为常人。《金匮》即从水精不四布，五经不并行之处，以言其患。谓人身所贵者，水也。天一生水，乃至充周流灌，无处不到，一有瘀蓄，即如江河回薄之处，秽莝丛积，水道日隘，横流旁溢，自所不免。必顺其性因其势而疏导之，由高山而平川，由平川而江海，庶得免乎泛滥。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>所以仲景分别浅深诲人，因名以求其义焉。浅者在于躯壳之内，脏腑之外，其名有四：曰痰饮，曰悬饮，曰溢饮，曰支饮。痰饮者，水走肠间，沥沥有声；悬饮者，水流胁下，咳唾引痛；溢饮者，水流行于四肢，汗不出而身重；支饮者，咳逆倚息短气，其形如肿。一由胃而下流于肠，一由胃而旁流于胁，一由胃而外出于四肢，一由胃而上入于胸膈。始先不觉，日积月累，水之精华转为混浊，于是遂成痰饮，必先团聚于呼吸大气难到之处，故由肠而胁而四肢，至渐渍于胸膈，其势愈逆。是痰饮之患，未有不从胃起者矣。其深者，由胃上入阳分，渐及于心肺；由胃下入阴分，渐及于脾肝肾。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>故水在心，心下坚筑短气，恶水不欲饮，缘水攻于外，火衰故水益坚，火郁于内，气收故筑动短气，火与水为仇，故恶而不饮也。水在肺，吐涎沫，欲饮水，缘肺主气，行荣卫，布津液，水邪入之，则塞其气道，气凝则液聚，变成涎沫，失其清肃，故引水自救也。水在脾，少气身重，缘脾恶湿，湿胜则气虚而身重也。水在肝，胁下支满，嚏而痛，缘肝与胆为表里，经脉并行于胁，火气冲鼻则嚏，吊胁则痛也。水在肾，心下悸，缘肾水凌心，逼处不安，又非支饮邻国为壑之比矣。夫五脏藏神之地也，积水泛为痰饮，包裹其外，诗有谓波撼岳阳城者，情景最肖，讵非人身之大患乎？然此特随其所在，辨名定位，以期治不乖方耳。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>究竟水所蓄聚之区，皆名留饮，留者留而不去也。留饮去而不尽者名伏饮，伏者伏而不出也。随其痰饮之或留或伏，而用法治之，始为精义。昌试言之。由胃而上胸膈心肺之分者，驱其所留之饮还胃，下从肠出，或上从呕出，其出皆直截痛快，而不至于伏匿，人皆知之。若由胸膈而外出肌肤，其清者或从汗出，其浊者无可出矣，必还返于胸膈，由胸膈还返于胃，乃可入肠而下出，驱之必有伏匿肌肤而不胜驱者。若由胸膈而深藏于背，背为胸之腑，更无出路，尤必还返胸膈，始得趋胃趋肠而顺下。岂但驱之不胜驱，且有挟背间之狂阳壮火，发为痈毒，结如橘囊者。伏饮之艰于下出，易于酿祸，其谁能辨而出之耶？昌以静理而谭医施治，凿凿有据，谨因《金匮》秘典，直授金针，令业医之子，已精而益求其精耳。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>　　　　　痰饮脉论</p>
<p>　　痰饮之脉，《金匮》错出不一，难于会通。以鄙见论之，亦有浅深微甚之不同，可预明也。脉要精微篇曰：肝脉软而散，色泽者，当病溢饮。溢饮者，渴暴多饮，而易入肌皮肠胃之外也。此特举暴饮水溢，饮病之最浅者为言耳。仲景会其意，即以饮证分之为四，统言其纲曰：痰饮、悬饮、溢饮、支饮，大都为由浅及深者商治。失此不治，而至于积水滔天，即此四饮，自有不可同语者矣。其谓饮脉不弦，但苦喘短气者，见饮脉本弦。饮脉不弦则水之积也不厚，然亦害其阳气，微喘短气而已。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>其谓支饮亦喘而不能卧，加短气，其脉平者，见支饮上于胸膈喘而短气，其脉仍平，有而若无，才有停积，未至留伏，故不见于脉也。其谓脉浮而细滑者伤饮，见浮而细滑，非伤风伤寒之比，亦饮之初郁气分而未深也。医者于此时，早思昏垫之灾，亟兴己溺之念，而行因势利导之法，患斯解矣。否则证成深锢，末流愈分，伏根之所，愈不可识，经年检方问药，漫图成功，其可得乎？故凡见脉转沉弦一派，即当按法求之。其曰脉沉者，胸中有留饮，短气而渴，四肢历节痛，言肺之治节不行，宗气不布，故短气；气不布则津亦不化，故膈燥而渴；脾气不运，水饮流于肢节，则作痛也。<a id="orig-60p" href="#trans-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>似此一证，肺脾交病，所称饮入于胃，游溢精气，上输于脾，脾气散精，上输于肺之常者，且转而借寇兵賷盗粮矣，欲求其安，宁可得乎？至论弦脉，则曰咳者其脉弦，为有水；曰双弦者寒也，皆大下后虚；脉偏弦者饮也，为喘满；曰脉弦数有寒饮，冬夏难治；曰脉沉而弦者，悬饮内痛。此即沉潜水蓄，支饮急弦而广其说，除大下后，其脉双弦者，有虚寒之别，其偏弦者，俱为水饮也。冬夏难治，亦因其用寒远寒，用热远热之法，不若春秋为易施耳。悬饮内痛，谓悬饮结积于内，其甚者则痛也。<a id="orig-61p" href="#trans-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>更有沉紧之脉，主心下痞坚，面色黧黑之证，谓水挟肾寒，杂揉于心肺之分，则心下坚而面色黑也。有脉伏而为留饮之证，积饮把持其脉而不露，较濇脉尤甚矣。又曰：脉伏便利，心下绩坚，此为留饮欲去故也。又曰：久咳数岁，其脉弱者可治，实大数者死；其脉虚者必苦冒，本有支饮在胸中故也。凡此皆病深而脉变，当一一溯其流而穷其源者。夫天枢开发，胃和则脉和，今为痰饮凝结其中，则开阖之机关不利，而脉因之转为沉弦、急弦、偏弦、弦数、弦紧，或伏而不见，非亟去其痰饮，亦胡由脉复其常耶？浅者浅治，深者深治，浅深之间者适其中而治。留者可攻，伏者可导，坚者可削。再一因循，病深无气，洒洒时惊，不可救药矣。<a id="orig-62p" href="#trans-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>　　　　　痰饮留伏论</p>
<p>　　痰饮之证，留伏二义，最为难明。前论留饮者留而不去，伏饮者即留饮之伏于内者也。留饮有去时，伏饮终不去，留伏之义，已见一斑。而《金匮》奥义，夫岂渺言能尽？谨再陈之。《金匮》论留饮者三，伏饮者一。曰：心下有留饮，其人背寒如掌大。曰：留饮者，胁下痛引缺盆。曰：胸中有留饮，其人短气而渴，四肢历节痛。言胸中留饮，阻抑上焦心肺之阳，而为阴曀，则其深入于背者，有冷无热，并阻督脉上升之阳，而背寒如掌大，无非阳火内郁之象也。<a id="orig-63p" href="#trans-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>胁下为手足厥阴上下之脉，而足少阳之脉，则由缺盆过季肋，故胁下引缺盆而痛，为留饮偏阻木火不伸之象。饮留胸中，短气而渴，四肢历节痛，为肺不行气，脾不散精之象也。合三条而观之，心肺肝脾痰饮，皆可留而累之矣，其义不更着耶。至伏饮则曰：膈上病痰，满喘咳吐，发则寒热，背痛腰痛，目泣自出，其人振振身瞤剧，必有伏饮。言胸中乃阳气所治，留饮阻抑其阳，则不能发动，然重阴终难蔽晛，有时阳伸，阴无可容，忽而吐发，其留饮可以出矣。若更伏留不出，乃是三阳之气伸而复屈。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>太阳不伸，作寒热，腰背痛，目泣；少阳不伸，风火之化，郁而并于阳明土中，阳明主肌肉，遂振振身瞤而剧也。留饮之伏而不去，其为累更大若此。然留饮伏饮，仲景不言治法。昌自其遏抑四脏三腑之阳而求之，则所云宜用温药和之者，岂不切于此证而急以之通其阳乎？所云苓桂朮甘汤者，虽治支满目眩，岂不切于此证而可仿其意乎？故必深知比例，始可与言往法也。<a id="orig-65p" href="#trans-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>后人不明《金匮》之理，妄生五饮六证之说，即以海藏之明，于五饮汤方下云：一留饮在心下，二支饮在胁下，三痰饮在胃中，四溢饮在膈上，五悬饮在肠间，而统一方以治之，何其浅耶！　　按痰饮总为一证，而因则有二。痰因于火，有热无寒；饮因于湿，有热有寒，即有温泉无寒火之理。人身热郁于内，气血凝滞，蒸其津液，结而为痰，皆火之变现也。水得于湿，留恋不消，积而成饮，究竟饮证热湿酿成者多，寒湿酿成者少。盖湿无定体，春曰风湿，夏曰热湿，秋曰燥湿，冬曰寒湿。三时主热，一时主寒，热湿较寒湿三倍也。《内经》湿土太过，痰饮为病，治以诸热，非指痰饮为寒。后人不解，妄用热药，借为口实。讵知凡治六淫之邪，先从外解。故治湿淫所胜，亦不远热以散其表邪，及攻里自不远于寒矣。<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>况始先即不可表，而积阴阻遏身中之阳，亦必借温热以伸其阳，阴邪乃得速去，若遂指为漫用常行之法，岂不愚哉！　　《小学》有虚实分治之法，谓疾病之生也，皆因外感内伤，生火、生湿、湿热、生痰，四者而已。审其少壮新病，是湿则燥之，是火则泻之，湿而生热则燥湿而兼清热，火而生痰则泻火而兼豁痰，无余蕴矣。审其衰老久病，又当攻补兼施。如气虚而有湿热痰火，则以四君子汤补气而兼燥湿清热豁痰泻火；如血虚而有痰火湿热，则以四物汤补血而兼泻火豁痰清热燥湿。如此则攻补合宜，庶乎可也。<a id="orig-67p" href="#trans-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>故曰：少壮新病，攻邪可审；老衰久病，补益为先。若夫阴虚火动，脾胃衰弱，真阴者水也，脾胃者土也，土虽喜燥，然太热则草木枯槁，木虽喜润，然太润则草木湿烂，是以补脾滋肾之剂，务在燥湿得宜，随证加减焉耳。　　后世治痰饮有四法：曰实脾、燥湿、降火、行气。实脾燥湿，二陈、二朮最为相宜，若阴虚则反忌之矣。降火之法，须分虚实，实用苦寒，虚用甘寒，庶乎可也。若夫行气之药，诸方漫然，全无着落，谨再明之。风寒之邪，从外入内，裹其痰饮，惟用小青龙汤，则分其邪从外出而痰饮从下出也。浊阴之气，从下入上，裹其痰饮，用茯苓厚朴汤，则分其浊气下出而痰饮上出也。<a id="orig-68p" href="#trans-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>多怒则肝气上逆而血亦随之，气血痰饮，互结成癖，用柴胡鳖甲散以除之。多忧则脾气内郁，而食亦不化，气食痰饮，亦互结成癖，用清痰丸以除之。多欲则肾气上逆，直透膜原，结垒万千，(月真)胀重坠，不可以仰，用桂苓丸引气下趋，痰饮始豁也。　　虚寒痰饮，少壮十中间见一二，老人小儿十中常见四五。若果脾胃虚寒，饮食不思，阴气痞塞，呕吐涎沫者，宜温其中。真阳虚者，更补其下，清上诸药不可用也。　　小儿慢脾风，痰饮阻塞窍隧，星附六君汤以醒之。　　老人肾虚水泛，痰饮上涌，崔氏八味丸以摄之。　　痰在膈上，大满大实，非吐不除，然非定法也。<a id="orig-69p" href="#trans-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>使为定法，人人能用之矣，何必独推子和哉。子和必相其人可吐后，乃吐之。一吐不彻，俟再俟三，缓以开之。据云涌痰之法，自有擒纵卷舒，其非浪用可知。再论《金匮》不言之意以明之。《伤寒论》用汗吐下和温之法矣，至痰饮首当言吐者，仲景反不言之，何耶？其以吐发二字为言者，因喘满而痰饮上溢，从内而自发也。其曰：医吐下之，不愈。亦非以吐下为咎也。其曰：呕家本渴，渴者为欲解。又属望于从吐得解也。胡竟不出可吐一语耶？仲景意中谓痰饮证内多夹冲气眩冒等证，吐之则殆，故不烦辞说，直不以吐立法，开后世之过端，所以为立法之祖也。自子和以吐法擅名，无识者争趋捷径，贻误　　不可胜道，必会仲景意以言吐，然后吐罔不当也。<a id="orig-70p" href="#trans-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>　　　　　痰饮留伏论</p>

<p>　　伤寒病，两胁痞满而痛，用十枣汤下。其痰饮杂病，虽非伤寒之比，而悬饮内痛在胁则同。况脉见沉弦，非亟夺其邪，邪必不去，脉必不返，所以用十枣汤不嫌其过峻也。凡病之在胁而当用下者，必仿此为例也。至甘遂甘草汤之治留饮，微妙元通，非深入圣域，莫能制之。《内经》但曰留者攻之耳，仲景于是析义以尽其变。无形之气，热结于胃则用调胃承气攻之，热结于肠则用大小承气攻之。有形之饮，痞结于胸，则用陷胸汤攻之；痞结于胁，则用十枣汤攻之；留结于肠胃之间，则用甘遂半夏汤攻之。<a id="orig-73p" href="#trans-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>法曰，病者脉伏，其人欲自利，利反快，虽利心下续坚满，此为留饮欲去故也，甘遂半夏汤主之。脉道为留饮所隔，伏而不行，其证欲下利，利反快，似乎留饮欲去，然虽欲去不能去也。心下续坚满，可见留饮之末，已及于肠，留饮之根，仍着于胃，不刬其根，饮必不去，故立是方。甘遂甘草大相反者，合而用之，俾其向留着之根，尽力一刬，得留者去而药性已不存矣，正《内经》有故无殒之义也。又加白蜜同煎，留恋其药，不致迸入无过之地。其用半夏、芍药者，由木入土中，成其坚满，半夏益土，芍药伐木，抑何神耶？后世方书，并甘草删去，神奇化为腐朽，制方立论，皆中人以下之事矣，竟何益哉！<a id="orig-74p" href="#trans-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>　　　　　论木防己汤葶苈大枣泻肺汤防己椒目葶苈大黄丸三方<br>　　三方皆治支饮上入膈中，而有浅深次第之分。首一方先治其肺，中一方颛治其肺，后一方兼治肺气所传之腑。盖支饮上入于膈，逼近心肺，粤援肾邪。本文云：其人喘满，心下痞坚，面色黧黑，其脉沉紧，得之数十日，医吐下之，不愈，木防己汤主之。虚者即愈，实者三日复发，复与不愈者，去石膏加茯苓、芒硝。盖以支饮上入，阻其气则逆于肺间而为喘满，阻其血则杂揉心下而为痞坚。肾气上应，其色黑，血凝之色亦黑，故黧黑见于面部。然且姑缓心肾之治，先治其肺，肺之气行，则饮不逆而俱解耳。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>木防己味辛温，能散留饮结气，又主肺气喘满；石膏辛甘微寒，主心下逆气，清肺定喘；人参甘温，治喘消膈饮，补心肺不足；桂枝辛热，通血脉，开结气，宣导诸药，在气分服之即愈。若饮在血分，深连下焦，必愈而复发，故去石膏气分之药，加芒硝入阴分、开痰结、消血癖，合之茯苓，去心下坚，且伐肾邪也。葶苈大枣汤，大泻其肺气，亦以气停故液聚耳。防己椒目亭苈大黄丸，治腹满口舌干燥，肠间有水气之证，乃肺气膹郁于上，以致水饮不行于下，而燥热之甚，用此丸急通水道，以救金气之膹郁，不治上而治其下，故用丸剂也。<a id="orig-76p" href="#trans-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>　　　　　论小半夏汤小半夏加茯苓汤外台茯苓饮三方<br>　　前一方治支饮呕而不渴者，支饮上入膈中，而至于呕，从高而越，其势最便。但呕家本当渴，渴则可征支饮之全去。若不渴，其饮尚留，去之未尽也。不必加治，但用半夏之辛温，生姜之辛散，再引其欲出之势，则所留之邪自尽矣。中一方，亦治卒呕吐者，但多心下痞，膈间有水眩悸，故加茯苓以去水伐肾而安心也。后一方加人参、枳实、橘皮，尤为紧要。治积饮既去，而虚气塞满其中，不能进食，此证最多，《金匮》早附《外台》一方，启诱后人，非天民之先觉而谁？<br>　　　　　论泽泻汤厚朴大黄汤二方<a id="orig-77p" href="#trans-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p>

<p>　　痰治者，痰塞于咽喉之间，虽是小病，而大病实成于此，古人所以另立门以治之。然而所立之方，皆是治痰之标，不能治痰之本也。故立二陈汤以治上中下、新暂久之病，然而无实效也。今另立三方：一治初起之痰，一治已病之痰，一治久病之痰。痰病虽多，要不能越吾之范围也。初起者，伤风咳嗽吐痰是也。用半夏、陈皮、天花粉、茯苓、甘草、苏子各一钱，水煎服，二剂则痰消，此方去上焦之痰也。上焦之痰，原止在胃中而不在肺，去其胃中之痰，而肺金气肃，何致火之上升乎。已病之痰，痰在中焦也，必观其色之白与黄，而辨之最宜分明，黄者乃火已将退也，白者火正炽也。<a id="orig-107p" href="#trans-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>火炽者，宜用寒凉之品；火将退者，宜加祛逐之品。吾今立一方，俱可治之。白朮、白芥子各三钱，茯苓五钱，陈皮、甘草各一钱，栀子一钱火痰加之，枳壳五分，水煎服。此方系健脾之剂，非祛痰之剂也。然而痰之多者，多由于脾气之湿。今健其脾气，则水湿之气下行，水湿既不留于脾中，又何从而上出？况又加之消痰之圣药，而痰有不安静速亡者乎？至于久病之痰，切不可作脾湿生痰论。盖久病不愈，未有不肾水亏损者，非肾水泛上为痰，即肾火沸腾为痰，此久病之痰，当补肾以祛逐之。方用熟地、薏仁、芡实各五钱，山茱萸、麦冬、茯苓、山药各三钱，北五味、车前子各一钱，益智仁三分，水煎服，此治水泛为痰之圣药。若火沸为痰者，内加肉桂一钱。<a id="orig-108p" href="#trans-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>此方之妙，纯是补肾之味，而又兼祛湿之品，化痰之味。水入肾宫，自变化为真精，又安有升腾为痰者乎？此治下焦有痰之法也。有此三方，再看何证出入加减，治痰无余事矣。　　尚有二方，治痰之久而成老痰者。方用柴胡、甘草各一钱，白芥子、薏仁各五钱，茯苓、白芍各三钱，陈皮三分，丹皮二钱，天花粉八分，水煎服。此方妙在用白芥子为君，薏仁、白芍为臣，柴胡、花粉为佐，使老痰无处可藏，自然渐渐消化。此方可用八剂，老痰无不消者，方名消浊散。又方：治顽痰。成块而塞在咽喉者为顽痰，留在胸膈而不化者为老痰。方用紫菀二钱，半夏、贝母、茯苓，桔梗、白朮、神曲各三钱，白矾、甘草各一钱，水煎服。<a id="orig-109p" href="#trans-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>此方妙在贝母与半夏同用，一燥一湿，使痰无处藏避，又有白矾以消块，桔梗，紫菀以去邪，甘草调停中央，有不奏功如响者乎？　　人患痰病久不愈，用猪肺头一个，萝卜子五钱研碎，白芥子一两研碎，五味调和，饭锅蒸熟，饭后顿食一　即愈。此方治上焦之痰，汤药不能愈者，神验。盖久留于肺上，而尽消其膜膈之痰，亦治之最巧者。　　中痰，方用人参、白朮、茯苓各三钱，附子、天南星各一钱，半夏二钱，水煎服，下喉即愈。盖痰之生也，由于气之虚，而气之虚也，由于脏腑之冷。故方中用参、朮以补正气，用半夏、南星、茯苓以祛痰，用附子以温中，所以一下喉而痰声静，痰气清也。　　如入上焦，壅滞痰块，不上不下，塞在胸间，气喘，欲呕不能，欲吐不能者，法当用阴阳水探吐之。<a id="orig-110p" href="#trans-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>或用瓜蒂、藜芦煎汁，饮之即吐。然必痰气与火结住在胸间作痛者，始可用此法吐之，否则断断不可。盖人之元气，不可一伤，吐一次则五脏反复，必损寿元。故必问其人胸痛否，气塞否，喉间有所碍否，痰吐出黄否，有此数种，始可用前药以吐之。　　吐不可轻用，不知禁忌而妄吐之，必致五脏反复不宁。必须看其痰吐在壁上，如蜗牛之涎有光亮者，放心吐之，余则皆忌。但看其光亮者，无论其痰在上中下。此光亮之色，必须俟其痰迹干而分辨之，不可据其湿痰时，而即以为光亮也已。　　中气而又中痰，虽若中之异，而实皆中于气之虚也。气虚自然多痰，痰多必然耗气，虽分而实合耳。<a id="orig-111p" href="#trans-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>方用人参一两，半夏、茯苓、南星各三钱，附子、甘草各一钱，水煎服，中气中痰之证俱愈。盖人参原是气分之神剂，而亦消痰之妙药；半夏、南星，虽是逐痰之神品，而亦扶气之正神；附子、甘草，一仁一勇，相济而成大敌，用于三味之中，扶正必致祛邪，荡痰必然益气；分合而无分合之形，奇绝而有神化之妙，又不可不知。　　气治者，气病实多，吾亦举其大者言之，如气逆痰滞是也。夫痰之滞，非痰之故，乃气之滞也。苟不利气而惟治痰，吾未见痰去而病消也。方用白朮二钱，茯苓三钱，人参、陈皮、天花粉、白芥子、神曲、苏子各一钱，豆蔻三垃，水煎服。此方之妙，在治痰之中，而先理气，气顺则痰活，气顺则湿流通，而痰且不生矣。此气治之宜知，可即一方而悟滞气之法。<a id="orig-112p" href="#trans-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>　　气虚痰多之证，痰多本是湿也，而治痰之法，又不可徒去其湿，必须补气为先，而佐以消痰之品。方用人参、半夏、茯苓各三钱，薏仁五钱，神曲、陈皮、甘草各一钱，水煎服。此方虽有半夏、陈皮消痰，然不多用人参则痰不消；有人参以助气，有薏仁、茯苓之类，自能健脾以去湿，湿去而痰自除，此气治之一法也。更有气虚痰寒者，即用前方，加肉桂三钱、干姜五分足矣。气虚痰热者不可用，当用麦冬、白芍、当归各三钱，天花粉、甘草、陈皮、白芥子各一钱，茯苓二钱，神曲三分，水煎服。此方之妙在不燥，而又是补气之剂，润以化痰，痰去而气自足也。得此二方，则治气无难。<a id="orig-113p" href="#trans-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>又有肾水上泛，吐痰倾盆者，亦宜用六味汤加附子、肉桂煎汤数碗饮之而愈者。凡肾水肾火之虚，上焦虽见热证，而其舌终滑而不燥，非若阳证之干极而起刺也。　　肥人多痰，乃气虚也，虚则气不能运行故痰生，则治痰必须补气兼消其痰耳。然补气又不可纯补脾胃之土，当兼补其命门之火。盖火能生土，而土自生气，气足而痰自消，不治痰正所以治痰也。方用人参、杜仲、白芥子各三两，白朮、薏仁、芡实各五两，熟地八两，山萸四两，肉桂、茯苓各二两，砂仁五钱，益智仁、橘红五味各一两为末，蜜丸，每日白滚水送下五钱。此方之佳，全在肉桂补命门心包之火，心包之火足，自能开胃去痰；命门之火足，始能健脾去湿。况方中纯是补心补肾之味，肉桂于补药之中，行其地天之泰，水自归经，痰从何积？此肥人之治法有如此。<a id="orig-114p" href="#trans-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>古今图书集成医部全录卷二百四十</p>

class="marker">[210p]</a><br>　　卣翁老先生脉盛体坚，神采百倍，从无病邪敢犯。但每早浴面，必呕痰水几口，胸前惯自摩揉，乳下宗气，其动应衣，若夜睡宁，水道清，则胸中爽然。其候似病非病，遍考方书，广询明医，不得其解。昌谓是痰饮结于胸膈，小有窠囊，缘其气之壮盛，随聚随呕，是以痰饮不致为害，而膻中之气，则因呕而伤矣。夫膻中者，与上焦同位胸膈。经云上焦如雾，言其气之氤氲如雾也。又曰膻中者臣使之官，言其能分布胸中之气而下传也。今以呕之故而数动其气，则氤氲变为急迫上奔，然稍定则仍下布，亦不为害也。大率痰为标，气为本，治标易而治本则难。非治本之难，以往哲从未言其治法，而后人不知所治耳。昌试论之：治气之源有三：一曰肺气。肺气清则周身之气，肃然下行，先生之肺气则素清也。一曰胃气。胃气和则胸中之气亦易下行，先生之胃气则素和也。一曰膀胱之气。<a id="orig-211p" href="#trans-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>膀胱之气旺，则能吸引胸中之气下行，先生青年善养，膀胱之气则素旺也。其膻中之气乱而即治，扰而即恬者，赖此三气暗为输运，是以不觉其累，即谓之无病也可。若三气反干胸膈之人，其为紧为胀，可胜道哉！故未形之病可以不言，而屡动之气不可不亟反于氤氲。先生但觉为痰饮所苦，昼日尝鼓呼吸之气，触出胸膈之痰，而未知痰不可出，徒伤气也。盖夜卧则痰聚于胃，晨起自能呕出，日间胃之津液四达脏腑，即激之亦不出耳。<a id="orig-212p" href="#trans-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br>然则痰消则气自顺，是必以治痰为急。而体盛痰不易除，又必以健脾为先，脾健则新痰不生。其宿痰之在窠囊者，渐渍于胃，而上下分消，于是无痰则不呕，不呕则气不乱，气不乱则日返于氤氲矣。虽然，尚有一吃紧关头，当并讲也。人身胸中空旷如太虚，地气上则为云，必天气降而为雨，地气始收藏不动。诚会上焦如雾、中焦如沤、下焦如渎之意，则知云行雨施，而后沟渎皆盈，水道通决，乾坤有一番新景象矣。此义首重膀胱一经。<a id="orig-213p" href="#trans-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>经云：膀胱者州都之官，津液藏焉，气化则能出矣。如人之饮酒无算而不醉者，皆从膀胱之气化而出也。膻中位于膈内，膀胱位于腹内，膀胱之气化，则空洞善容，而膻中之气得以下运；若膀胱不化，则腹已先胀，膻中之气，安能下达耶？然欲膀胱之气化，其权尤在于葆肾，肾以膀胱为腑者也。肾气动，必先注于膀胱。屡动不已，膀胱满胀，势必逆奔于胸膈，其窒塞之状，不可名言。肾气不动，则收藏愈固，膀胱得以清净无为，而膻中之气注之不盈矣。膻中之气，下走既捷，则不为牵引所乱，而胸中旷若太空。昌更曰：顺气则痰不留，即不治痰而痰自运矣。卣臣先生问曰：痰在膈中，去喉不远，每早必痛呕始出者，何耶？曰：道不同也。胸膈之间，重重脂膜遮蔽，浑无空隙，痰从何出？所出者，胃中之痰耳。曰：然则膈中之痰不出耶？曰：安得不出，但出之艰耳。<a id="orig-214p" href="#trans-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>盖膻中之气，四布于十二经，布于手足六阳经，则其气从喉物而上出；布于手足六阴经，则其气从前后二阴而下出。然从下出者无碍，从上出者亦必先下注阳明，始得上越，是以难也。曰：若是则所论膀胱气化一段，渊乎微矣。但吸引之机权，从不见于经典，岂有所自乎？曰：《内经》有巨阳引精之义，缘无注解，人不能会。巨阳者，太阳膀胱也。谓膀胱能吸引胸中之气下行，而胸中之胀自消，此足证也。<a id="orig-215p" href="#trans-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>曰：胸中窠囊之说，确然无疑，但不知始于何因，结于何处，消于何时也？曰：人身之气，经盛则注于络，络盛则注于经。窠囊之来，始于痰聚胃口，呕时数动胃气，胃气动则半从上出于喉，半从内入于络。胃之络，贯膈者也。其气奔入之急，则冲透膈膜，而痰得以居之。痰入既久，则阻碍气道，而气之奔入者，复结一囊，如蜂子之营穴，日增一日，故治之甚难。必先去胃中之痰而不呕不触，俾胃经之气，不急奔于络，转虚其胃以听络中之气返还于胃，逐渐以药开导其囊而涤去其痰，则自愈矣。此昌独得之见，屡试之法也。<a

<p>The Taiyin is at the spring; the dampness overcomes, leading to heart pain from fluid accumulation among the people. <em>(Note: The Taiyin at the spring corresponds to the years of Chen and Xu, where fluid accumulation causes heart pain, indicating that cold damp rises). The victory of the Taiyin uniquely overcomes, causing internal dampness to accumulate and fluid to appear above. The recovery of the Taiyin comes when the dampness transforms and the fluid arises from within.</em><br><em>(Note: This occurs when the fire and earth combine before the midpoint of the year. The unique victor refers to the cold damp aspect, which recovers after the midpoint of the year, leading to internal dampness that presses on the lower abdomen. The fluid emerging from within and swelling above indicates the water pathogen rises from below, between, and above. Recovery refers to overcoming the defeated qi, extreme accumulation, and subsequent rebound.)</em></p>

<p>In a year when the earth is excessive, rain and dampness spread, kidney water becomes affected by evil influences, leading to severe drinking outbreaks, reduced appetite, and fullness in the abdomen.<br>[Note: Earth refers to its element in the ground, and dampness refers to its element in the sky; thus, in those years, the earth&#39;s energy becomes excessive, and rain and dampness spread. Drinking refers to the spleen&#39;s inability to transport and transform, resulting in phlegm and fluid accumulation. Fullness and reduced appetite arise because of earth deficiency, which cannot assist in transformation. When such excesses occur, they reverse the original deficiency and cause self-harm, leading to these sicknesses emerging at the time the earth&#39;s energy attains its proper position in the eighteen days of the seasonal months.]  </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>A question was asked: There are four types of fluids, what are they? The teacher replied: There are phlegm fluid, suspended fluid, abundant fluid, and obstructive fluid. </p>
<p>The question was: How do the four types differ? The teacher said: The person who was once robust but is now thin has water moving in the intestines, making a dripping sound; this is called phlegm fluid. If after drinking the water lingers under the ribs, causing coughing and pain, this is called suspended fluid. If the water flows to the limbs, resulting in heaviness and pain, especially when sweating is not present, this is called abundant fluid. If coughing and difficulty lying down occur, with the person appearing swollen, this is called obstructive fluid. </p>
<p>Water in the heart causes hardness beneath the heart, leading to shortness of breath and aversion to drinking. Water in the lungs leads to expectoration of phlegm and a desire to drink. Water in the spleen causes slight breathlessness and heaviness in the body. Water in the liver causes fullness under the ribs, with sneezing and pain. Water in the kidneys leads to palpitations. Retained fluid under the heart makes the person&#39;s back cold, feeling like the size of a palm. </p>
<p>For those with retained fluid, there is pain under the ribs extending to the lower back, and coughing usually alleviates it. If there is retained fluid in the chest, the person experiences shortness of breath and thirst, with pain in the limbs at the joints. A sinking pulse indicates retained fluid. </p>
<p>With phlegm above the diaphragm, fullness leads to wheezing and coughing; there may be alternating chills and fever, lower back pain, and spontaneous tears; such a person will shake and tremble, surely having underlying fluid issues. </p>
<p>Patients who drink too much water inevitably suffer from intense wheezing. Generally, if food intake is low and water intake is high, water may accumulate beneath the heart; in severe cases, this leads to palpitations, and in milder cases, to shortness of breath. A double-string pulse signifies coldness, while all severe cases after a major purge show deficiency. A pulse that is slightly stringy indicates fluid presence. Lung fluid does not present as a stringy pulse but rather indicates wheezing and shortness of breath.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>Whenever there is water in the heart, the person experiences palpitations, shortness of breath, and fear; they may feel dizzy and delusional. If the condition arises from cold, it is seen as deficiency; if from heat, it is seen as excess. Thus, if water is in the heart, the individual’s chest feels tight, palpitates with short breaths, dislikes water and does not wish to drink. If water is in the lungs, they may spit saliva and desire to drink. If water is in the spleen, the person feels fatigued and heavy all over. If water is in the liver, they may experience fullness under the ribs, sneezing, and pain. If water is in the kidneys, they will experience palpitations in the chest.</p>
<p>A patient who suddenly drinks a lot of water will certainly suffer from acute asthma. Generally, if food intake is low but water consumption is high, water stagnates in the heart, leading to severe palpitations or mildly to shortness of breath. A double-string pulse indicates cold; all these conditions lead to a preference for deficiency after significant bowel movement. A side-string pulse indicates the presence of fluid. If there is lung fluid without a string-like pulse, there is a tendency for shortness of breath. If there is fluid retention, one might also experience asthma and an inability to sleep, along with shortness of breath and a smooth pulse. </p>
<p>In cases of retained fluid, there are no outward signs, and without heat, the pulse is weak; the individual will feel fullness and cannot eat. A deep and slippery pulse indicates the illness of retained fluid. In those with retained fluid, pain may radiate from the sides to the lower back, leading to severe coughing; individuals may cough and feel unable to lie down, experiencing neck pain while coughing, resembling a condition seen in children with convulsions. If fluid is accumulated in the chest, the person will feel short of breath and thirsty, with pain in the limbs and joints; a deep pulse indicates the presence of retained fluid.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is retained fluid in the chest, the person has a cold sensation on their back, and it feels as large as a hand. If the patient has a raised shoulder and difficulty breathing, these indicate fluid overflow in the chest. In chronic cases, there may be fullness like a pot and severe swelling resembling a horse’s knife, caused by phlegm-fluid. The illness above the diaphragm presents as fullness, wheezing, coughing, and expectoration, with alternating chills and fevers, back pain and aversion to cold, and weeping of the eyes. The person may shake or tremble, indicating hidden fluid. If one arm is unresponsive, sometimes shifting to the other arm, and the pulse is deep and thin, this is not wind but rather fluid present in the upper burner. A weak pulse indicates slight exhaustion because the qi of the nutritive and defensive systems is not circulating properly. In winter, recovery occurs naturally. </p>
<p>For treating suspended fluid, use Shizao Decoction. If there is sweating and coughing with difficulty in breathing, this is fluid accumulation. In cases of excessive fluid, one should induce sweating, and Xiao Qinglong Decoction is the primary remedy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are six types of drinking: suspended drinking, overflowing drinking, support drinking, phlegm drinking, retained drinking, and lurking drinking; Nesting Shi has detailed these well. Pang Anchang often said: &quot;If there is no phlegm above in the human body, then there is no water flowing upstream in the world.&quot; Truly wise words! From this perspective, the pathway of human qi is valued for being smooth; when it flows smoothly, bodily fluids circulate, and there will be no concern about phlegm or drink. If regulation and restraint are not appropriate, the qi pathway becomes obstructed, resulting in water and drink stagnating in the chest and forming phlegm. The symptoms of this illness are not one but many: it can lead to wheezing, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, palpitations, cold and hot pains, swelling, fullness, and constipation, all caused by phlegm or drink. If you examine the pulse, a firm or slippery pulse indicates drink. </p>
<p>As for the method of treating drink, it may involve purging or sweating, warming or benefiting; these are fixed methods. The foolish might think that the difference between warming and benefiting could be harmless, but if purging or sweating is misapplied, it leads to substantial illness. It is better to prioritize smoothing the qi first and then guiding it afterward. When the qi is smooth, bodily fluids circulate, phlegm and drink are moved downward, and are expelled through urination. Those with illnesses that make them want to spit phlegm and find relief from taking Eight Ingredients Pills can also have some intention behind their actions. Wang Shuhe said: &quot;The kidneys are cold and produce much saliva.&quot; The kidneys are the organs of water; they can receive and manage water, and when kidney qi is warm and harmonious, fluids descend. When kidney qi is deficient and cold, pathogenic water rises instead. To counter this, mountain cornelian, yam, and similar herbs are used for nourishment, while aconite and cinnamon are used for warmth, and poria and water plantain for diuresis; this reasoning is indeed correct. During an acute illness, one should examine the situation carefully and in detail.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Confucian Way of Filial Piety</h3>
<h4>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</h4>
<p>Drinking should be moderated based on the temperature of the water and the severity of the discussion.</p>
<p>Retention of fluids is simply the accumulation of water. In Wang&#39;s &quot;Pulse Canon,&quot; it is classified into four types: phlegm retention, suspended fluids, obstructive fluids, and overflow of fluids. &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; further categorizes it into five, all defined by the presentation of the illness. I shall not elaborate on these classifications now. The reasons for fluid retention can be traced to five causes: 1) arising from frustration and anger, 2) from exhaustion, 3) from deep contemplation, 4) from excessive drinking, and 5) from harm caused by heat during cold seasons. Although there are many manifestations of fluid retention, they all fall into these categories.</p>
<p>When frustration and anger are suppressed, the liver energy affects the spleen, leading to failure in digestion and hence fluid retention. The liver governs thought; prolonged indecision restricts the flow of bodily energies, resulting in fluid retention. For those who work hard and travel long distances, exhaustion leads them to drink, and with weakened spleen and stomach, they may feel lethargic and unable to disperse energy through the pulses, which also results in fluid retention.</p>
<p>Excessive drinking fills the stomach and intestines; further consumption exceeds the bladder&#39;s ability to excrete, leading to prolonged fluid retention. Additionally, in extreme heat, bodily fluids may dry up, leading one to crave cold water. In an attempt to quench thirst, excessive consumption leads to stagnation, resulting in fluid retention as well.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person suffers from the sickness of drinking, can they possibly go beyond these five issues? Water is a yin substance; when it accumulates, it produces humidity, and when liquor stagnates, it generates dryness. Over time, this leads to phlegm. If phlegm forms on the left side, it corresponds to excess fat; on the right side, it corresponds to the nature of breath. If it enters the lungs, it causes frequent coughing; if it enters the large intestine, it leads to diarrhea; if it enters the kidneys, it results in retention of water. This condition presents as a bag filled with fluid, unable to move upwards or downwards. Placed under sunlight, it becomes a form of edema—these ailments stem from rebellious qi. </p>
<p>Thus, when humidity is present above, the eyes turn yellow and the face swells; when it is below, the thighs and knees become swollen and numb; when it is in the middle, there is fullness and stagnation in the chest. If phlegm remains in the yang and does not disperse, over time, it transforms into qi; if it remains in the yin and does not disperse, it eventually solidifies. In contemporary treatments, it is commonly stated that drinking leads to cold accumulation, thus using damp-heat remedies to counteract the dryness. However, coldness from drink in the middle is treated with heat remedies from above, which are rebuffed by coldness, and moisture has not been resolved, resulting instead in increased heart fire. </p>
<p>When the fire does not descend, water flows back down, causing desiccation in the upper burner and chill in the lower. The &quot;Nei Jing&quot; states that if the cycles of entering and exiting are dysfunctional, the spirit and transformations become extinguished. If rising and descending are obstructed, qi becomes isolated and perilous. Can this not be taken seriously? Moreover, retaining fluid does not have any restorative treatments, and when qi is blocked and obstructed, supplementation only worsens the condition. Do we not understand the “Nei Jing,” which states that retained fluids should be attacked? Why do later generations not diligently study the ancients? Additionally, using herbs like white atractylodes, ginseng, and poria for those who drink only increases obstructions. How much more so when employing fire needling and moxibustion for bloating can the situation be understood?<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the past, practitioners used more than thirty ingredients for the Wuyin Pill, which included minerals like alum stone, as well as herbs such as pungent herbs and Aconite. Although these were purgative, they all shared the properties of dryness and heat. While there were also cooling herbs included, they lacked the strength to balance out the formula. Therefore, in modern times, Liu Hejian based his formulation of the Sanhua Shenyouwan on Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Shizao Decoction, and added Da Huang (rhubarb) and Qian Niu (cowherb), yielding a remedy that could expel illness after taking thirty to fifty pills, allowing the harmful energy to flow out. </p>
<p>There was once a patient suffering from this condition for decades who came to me for diagnosis. The pulse on the left hand was weak and small across three positions, while the right hand exhibited a slippery and large pulse in the same three positions. The weak and small pulse indicated cold, while the slippery and large pulse signified dryness. I prescribed watermelon seed powder to expel their cold phlegm, resulting in several liters of sweat. Next, I employed a method to guide out the dry and dirty matter from their intestines and stomach, which also amounted to several liters. The patient improved by half; then I used a mild remedy to continue releasing the remaining buildup and a fire-reducing medicine to open the appetite. Within a month, the patient was completely healed.</p>
<p>Coptis and Phellodendron can clear away the excess heat and dampness above, while Astragalus and Poria can support the drainage of dampness below. The former can restrain what comes after but should not be used to drive out what comes first. Any remaining issues may be treated with bitter herbs like bitter thorn and apricot kernels, as well as mulberry root and peppercorns to expel water. All excess water should be eliminated. </p>
<p>In treating illness, there is an order to follow and one must not act chaotically. When the harmful energy is not yet expelled, one must be cautious about supplementation. When the great evil has just receded, there is a fear that it may rebound and intensify, becoming worse than before treatment.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the past, there was a person in Henei who fell ill from drinking. The doctor diagnosed him with dampness in the spleen and prescribed a formulation of costus and skylark root, which he ingested more than ten times. The doctor then deceived the patient by altering the formula into pills and had him take them again for over ten times. This was followed by changing the pills back into a powder, which he took once more for over ten times. The patient became increasingly exhausted, sleeping for nearly a whole day and night. When he finally awoke, his stomach felt spacious, and he only craved a small amount of porridge. Day by day, he improved. Although they both diagnosed him with dampness, the methods of tonifying and purging differed greatly, leading to such a distinction.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When the Earth element is excessive, rainy humidity spreads. The water from the kidneys is affected by evil influences, leading to an excessive accumulation of fluids. The Taiyang (Greater Yang) oversees Heaven, where humidity changes substances, causing internal accumulation of fluids that disrupt appetite. It is noted that this year, the Yin is in the springs, with dampness monitored by the Earth. The source of the illness arises from the Earth’s Qi. The Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) oversees Heaven, with damp Earth constituting the four aspects of Qi, resulting in nasal congestion, nosebleeds, and excessive fluids. Moreover, with damp Earth builds up, people suffer from fluid retention, edema, and heaviness in their bodies. When Taiyin (Greater Yin) arrives, it leads to an accumulation of yin and obstruction. The arrival of Taiyin causes ample accumulation; both the supremacy of Taiyin and its return are associated with fluid accumulation internally.</p>
<p>In light of this, it is understood that Earth governs the transformation of dampness but not cold, while Water governs the transformation of cold but not dampness. When there is frequent rainfall and the Earth accumulates puddles, it is considered as Water. The canon attributes this to Earth, stating frost and ice solidify, with the windy atmosphere being cold; this is the transformation of Water. Therefore, it is said that Chou and Wei (the Ox and Goat) represent the dampness of Earth, while Chen and Xu (the Dragon and Dog) represent the coldness of Water. The two transformations originate from different elements, leading to distinct ailments. When damp Earth is excessive, fluids accumulate internally. While some people believe that insufficient Spleen Earth is the issue, can ancient texts be easily interpreted? Should they be followed? Or not?<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm Illness</strong></p>
<p>In general, when a person suffers from phlegm, there are five main types of symptoms: the first is wind phlegm, the second is heat phlegm, the third is damp phlegm, the fourth is alcoholic phlegm, and the fifth is food phlegm. These phlegms reside in the diaphragm, causing the head and eyes to feel unclear and heavy, with thick mucus and saliva, or resulting in cough, wheezing, and fullness. Sometimes there may be tidal fever, and one can use Dusheng Powder to expel it. Next, one may take the modified Decoction or Fengsou Pills, or Liangge Powder alternately. The <em>Inner Canon</em> states this refers to the concept of flowing dampness and moistening dryness.</p>
<p>For phlegm illnesses, there are five types: wind phlegm, heat phlegm, damp phlegm, alcoholic phlegm, and food phlegm. When phlegm is present in the upper stomach, it can harm the head because all yang gathers there. This causes patients to feel heaviness in the head with watery eyes and thick mucus, or to cough and wheeze. Occasionally, there can be chills and fever; in such cases, one can take Red Adzuki Bean Soup to expel it. After vomiting, one should treat according to the symptoms, taking remedies to dispel wind, eliminate heat, drain dampness, and transform phlegm, such as Tongsheng Powder with half-sliced Pinellia to guide qi—what a marvelous approach! </p>
<p>For those recently afflicted with wind phlegm, they tend to feel cold and drink cold beverages; heat phlegm is produced when fire is excessive, and damp phlegm results from stagnant fluids. One can take modified Lianqiao Decoction, Dampness-Removing Pills, or Wuyou Powder. Those with alcoholic phlegm can use Jiedu San Sheng Pills. Lastly, for food phlegm, one may use Han Fangji Pills or select Dan Sha for application. Following these prescriptions will undoubtedly yield miraculous effects.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Expectoration Method</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm located above the chest and diaphragm, when full and solid, cannot be expelled without expectoration. Zhongjing said: The great method is to expel during spring. This is because in spring the yang qi rises, and both human qi and pathogenic qi are also elevated, thus it is appropriate to expel. The medicines for expectoration can be in the form of pills or powders, and one should stop once the primary ailment is addressed; there is no need to exhaust the dosage, as excess can be harmful. Thus, although there are urgent situations throughout the four seasons requiring expulsion, one does not necessarily have to wait for spring; however, Zhongjing emphasized it as a principal method. Today, people do not grasp this method and have abandoned it entirely. Let us briefly list a few notable prescriptions: In Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; there is the scallion and fermented soybean soup to expel headaches, gardenia and magnolia bark decoction to expel vexation, and melon stalk powder to expel cold damage for those experiencing fullness in the lower abdomen after diarrhea with no sweat and wheezing; the &quot;Prescriptions of Historical Medical Texts&quot; prescribes the rare saliva powder to expel internal fullness of the diaphragm, phlegmy cough, loss of voice, and tightly clenched jaws, as if one has lost their spirit; the &quot;Comprehensive Prescriptions&quot; uses the kurbute powder to expel headaches and dizziness, with aversion to wind and nausea; the &quot;Universal Relief Prescriptions&quot; utilizes the wind-catching powder to expel inability to open the mouth, with loss of consciousness; the &quot;General Compilation Prescriptions&quot; includes common mountain herbs for expelling malaria; the &quot;Sun Shang Recipes&quot; employs the Three Holy powder to expel mania; and the &quot;Proven Efficacy Formulas&quot; addresses tongue misalignment.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

I use Gua Ti San to induce vomiting for headache due to pathogenic cold, and a scallion and fermented soybean soup to induce vomiting for miscellaneous headaches. Sometimes, using only Gua Ti San, known as &quot;Dú Shèng,&quot; with a bit of tea powder to expel phlegm; or adding a whole scorpion&#39;s tail to induce vomiting for stabbing pain in the sides that is gurgling with sound. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions that dampness in the upper part should be expelled with bitter substances; is this not what it refers to? Nowadays, there are those who also use vomiting, but sometimes it succeeds and sometimes it fails, with some unable to expel or stop the outpour; they do not understand that the method of ascending and expelling is called &quot;lifting phlegm,&quot; and the character &quot;lifting&quot; itself encompasses capturing and releasing. Recently, there was a physician who induced vomiting in a woman, and she could not stop for half a month, with saliva accumulating to several buckets, her life hanging by a thread, in a state of panic and miscalculation, seeking my solution. I instructed to brew a musk soup, which resolved the issue immediately upon ingestion.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

The other twenty-six are non-toxic purgatives, and one should choose and use them according to the symptoms. This method should start with a small dose, without causing overwhelming effects, and gradually increase the amount. For those who struggle to expel phlegm, use a probe such as a pin or chicken feather to extract it; if it does not come out, apply juices to aid in expulsion. Continue probing while applying, as all should eventually be expelled. If vomiting leads to dizziness or headaches, drinking ice water will immediately relieve the symptoms; if ice water is unavailable, fresh spring water can also be taken. Strong individuals can be fine after a single purge, while weaker ones may require three or four purges, which should not cause harm. Some may feel significantly better the next day, while others may worsen, as the effects of purging may still be taking hold; in such cases, wait a few days before attempting to purge again. If one feels thirsty, fresh water, melons, and cool foods are acceptable, but one should avoid overeating or heavy, hard-to-digest dishes. Once the heart fire is subdued, the middle burner will harmonize, and yin energy will strengthen. It is crucial to avoid excessive sexual activity and to manage great worries or anger.

<p><strong>Phlegm Disease</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is floating, and one should induce vomiting. If the pulse has long been thin, it will be difficult to resolve suddenly, and one must be diligent in treatment. Generally, when treating phlegm, excessive use of purging medicines can lead to deficiency of the spleen qi, making phlegm easier to form and increase. For damp phlegm, use Atractylodes and White Atractylodes; for heat phlegm, use Indigo and the properties of Coptis and Scutellaria; for food phlegm, use Shén Qū (medicated leaven), malt, and hawthorn; for wind phlegm, use Nansh (Arisaema); for chronic phlegm, use Haishi (sea stones), Banxia (Pinellia), and herbs like Xianhe (Corydalis), and take them in pill form. If phlegm is in the diaphragm, one must use vomiting methods; purging will not be effective. Wind phlegm often presents with unusual symptoms, while damp phlegm commonly brings fatigue and weakness. If the qi is solid and phlegm heat is stagnated above, inducing vomiting will be difficult. Clear phlegm is associated with cold; use formulas like Erchen Tang. For thick and turbid phlegm, inducing vomiting is essential. Heat phlegm combined with wind shows more external symptoms. Treat the heat with clearing methods, and for food accumulation, use aggressive treatments, combined with qi tonics to help it descend. If phlegm is caused by excessive fire rising, one should prioritize clearing the fire using substances like White Atractylodes, Scutellaria, and soft gypsum. </p>
<p>For internally caused phlegm, one must use medicines like Ginseng and Astragalus, often combined with ginger juice for transmission, or add Banxia for stronger effects; if the deficiency is severe, add bamboo juice, and if the central qi is insufficient, add Ginseng and Atractylodes. </p>
<p>Phlegm as a substance rises and falls with the qi, present everywhere. For those with spleen deficiency, tonifying spleen qi and clearing central qi to facilitate phlegm descent is recommended, using formulas like Erchen Tang with added White Atractylodes, along with raising herbs like Cimicifuga.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the middle jiao, if there is phlegm combined with food accumulation leading to illness, the stomach qi is also reliant on nourishment, and it should not be rashly attacked; if it is entirely expelled, there will be deficiency. Phlegm that has formed into clumps or cannot be expectorated, compounded by qi stagnation, phlegm dampness, or phlegm heat, is all difficult to treat. Phlegm located between the intestines and stomach can be resolved through expelling it. When it is in the meridians, it must be expelled through vomiting. The method of vomiting inherently includes a dispersing principle.</p>
<p>If epilepsy is caused by fright, then fright causes the spirit to leave its residence; when the residence is empty, phlegm is generated. When the blood and qi enter the residence and repel the spirit, it cannot return. For blood injuries, ginger juice must be used to facilitate movement. Huangqin treats heat phlegm, allowing one to clear the fire. Bamboo juice smooths phlegm, and only through ginger juice can it travel through the meridians. Wubeizi can treat chronic phlegm, assisting other medicines in effectively treating stubborn phlegm. Erchen Decoction can address all types of phlegm in the body; if one needs downward action, they should add herbs that guide downward, and if upward action is needed, they should add herbs that guide upward.</p>
<p>In general, when using vomiting herbs, it is advisable to raise and lift the qi to facilitate vomiting. Herbs such as Fangfeng, Yanzhi, Chuanxiong, Jiegang, Yacha, and fresh ginger, or the use of wax gourd stem powder can be utilized.</p>
<p>For cases of wind-phlegm disease, wind-phlegm medicines must be used, such as BaiFuzhi, Tianma, Xionghuang, Niuhuang, Pianqing, Jiangcan, and Zhuya Zaojiao. </p>
<p>In any individual, if there are masses found in the upper, middle, or lower body, they are often phlegm. After inquiring what they usually like to eat, one should use medication after expelling.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of dizziness and noise, it indicates the phlegm caused by fire. Use Er Chen Tang with added gardenia fruit, yellow locust root, and yellow gentian. If there is acidity in the breath, this signifies food stagnation with heat and an upward movement of fire. Use yellow gentian as the main ingredient, with pinellia and nascent ginger as deputies, and tangerine peel as a messenger. If there is excess heat, add indigo.</p>
<p>For phlegm under the ribs, only white mustard seeds can reach it. If phlegm is beneath the skin and outer layers, ginger juice and bamboo juice must be used to guide it. For phlegm in the limbs, bamboo juice is essential to release it. For phlegm congestion in the throat that is dry and cannot be expelled or swallowed, use phlegm-transforming herbs paired with salty tastes to soften the masses (e.g., pinellia, apricot kernel, sea stone, balloon flower, and forsythia), mixed with ginger juice and honey into lozenges for sucking.</p>
<p>Hai Fen refers to sea stone; it can reduce hot phlegm, dry damp phlegm, soften solidified phlegm, and dissolve stubborn phlegm. It may be used in pill form but not in decoctions. Bitter orange can expel phlegm, capable of breaking down walls. Xiao Wei Dan treats phlegm heat in the diaphragm, wind phlegm, damp phlegm, and pain in the shoulders, but it may deplete stomach qi and should be used sparingly for those with food accumulation and solid phlegm. Shen Yu Wan can dissipate phlegm.</p>
<p>If there is something stuck in the throat that cannot be coughed out or swallowed, this is old phlegm. In severe cases, it should be expelled; in milder cases, use pinellia varieties. If there is excessive qi, definitely use Jing Li.</p>
<p>Tian Hua Fen can significantly reduce heat phlegm in the diaphragm. Phlegm in the diaphragm can cause madness or forgetfulness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ancient method for treating phlegm through sweating, purging, and warming has, in my view, less merit than prioritizing the regulation of qi and then guiding it in a proper direction. Wang Yinjun states that clear phlegm is cold, while yellow and turbid phlegm is hot. If it starts clear, it can become yellow and turbid with time. Clear and white phlegm is thin and floats above, while yellow and turbid phlegm is thick and sticky, settling below. When coughing results in easy expulsion, the phlegm is clear and white; when coughing fails to bring it up, the phlegm becomes yellow and stagnant. If phlegm is coughed up for an extended period, and humidity and heat accumulate, causing a blockage above and below, it may entirely lose its clarity, even to the point of blood being present. When the blood deteriorates, it turns into black phlegm, symptomatic of a serious, obscure condition. Furthermore, clear phlegm has a mild taste, but over time it may develop a foul flavor, becoming sour, spicy, fishy, or bitter, among other unpleasant tastes. Many diseases involve phlegm, which is not widely recognized. The human body can harbor tuberculosis, which may not be painful, red, or produce pus—this is attributed to phlegm accumulation. Effective treatment for phlegm should fundamentally involve strengthening the spleen and correcting dampness.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Additional Thoughts on Diagnosis and Treatment of Phlegm Disease</strong>  </p>
<p>Blood and qi are the essence of the body. When the essence becomes depleted, pathogenic factors can invade, possibly due to underlying conditions. If both blood and qi are deficient and phlegm resides in the middle burner, it obstructs the processes of rising and descending, leading to the dysfunction of the twelve organs. Consequently, one&#39;s perception and actions may become deluded. Treating these patients with pathogens will surely lead to death. Alas! What injustice! Who is to blame?  </p>
<p>The younger brother of Xianmu, aged seventeen or eighteen, during the summer experienced great fatigue and thirst, excessively drinking plum juice, and subsequently suffered from profound shock three to four times, leading to delusions and hallucinations, resembling a possessed state. Upon examining his pulse, both hands showed a weak and wiry pulse but were also heavy. I said, &quot;The rapid pulse indicates heat; the weak and wiry pulse reflects the profound shock.&quot; Additionally, the sourness from the plum juice had stagnated in the middle burner. To replenish the deficiency, clear heat, and expel phlegm, his condition could be stabilized.  </p>
<p>I thus prescribed a decoction of ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, poria, scutellaria, and lonicera, mixed with bamboo sap and ginger juice for him to take. After ten days without effect, everyone criticized the inadequacy of the prescription. Upon further pulse examination, I discerned that his deficiency was incomplete and that the phlegm had not been successfully expelled. I adjusted the formula to include chrysanthemum sap and after another ten days, he recovered.  </p>
<p>My cousin, after drinking heartily one day, also exhibited nonsensical speech and delusions. Upon inquiry, it seemed that he was possessed by the spirit of his deceased brother, recounting events from his life. My uncle reprimanded him, saying, &quot;This is not the case; it is merely due to excessive consumption of fish and wine that has resulted in phlegm.&quot; A large bowl of saltwater was forced upon him, resulting in the expulsion of one to two liters of phlegm. Consequently, he sweated profusely, fell into a deep sleep for the night, and thereafter felt well.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

After about ten days, she died. When asked why the wrongly diagnosed illness led to death so swiftly, I replied: “In the hot month attending a feast, the external environment is steaming hot, and spicy food is appetizing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Spraying with medicinal water solidifies its essence and tightens its surface, preventing sweat from escaping. If sweat does not escape, then internal heat steams and burns, causing blood to become unsettled, leading to the depletion of yin and the inability of yang to stand alone. If one does not die, what is the wait for! Some say that there is a section on forbidden spells in the &quot;Essential Secrets of External Affairs,&quot; so can it be disregarded? I say: transforming essence into energy is merely a minor technique, suitable for treating small ailments. However, if there is internal deficiency and external excess, one must use a proper and grand method, which has been established and can be clearly examined. Yet, the virtue of talismanic water is only effective for heat phlegm in the stomach; a sip of cool water can alleviate stomach heat, which can indeed bring comfort. But if there is internal injury and deficiency, combined with the severe cold of winter, swallowing talismanic water will certainly freeze the stomach and cause harm. When there is stagnant heat above and heat pathogens on the surface, sweat must be released to resolve it. If one achieves coolness while the skin pores remain firm and tight, how can the heat be resolved? This must lead to internal attack, separating yin and yang, and causing blood and qi to conflict, bringing death ever closer.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

Wang Yinjun mentions that the phlegm syndrome has not been clearly detailed in ancient and modern times. Although medical texts differentiate between various types of fluids—suspended, retained, supporting, and phlegm fluids—there is little understanding of their source as a disease. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, tinnitus; or spasms of the mouth and eyes, itchiness in the eyebrows and ears; or swelling and stiffness in the limbs that feels like pain but is not; or tooth and cheek pain, with gingival swelling, presenting different levels of pain and itch; or acid regurgitation, noisy belching; or difficulty swallowing, with what is coughed up appearing like blackened coal, resembling torn cotton, peach resin, or clam meat; or a feeling beneath the heart like ice, with cold pain at times; or strange dreams of ghosts; or weakness in the legs and ankles, sudden back pain; or general aches in the joints of the limbs without a specific pattern, even leading to numbness in the hands and pain in the arms, resembling sprains; or a painful area in the spine the size of a palm, similar to ice cold; or a feeling throughout the body as if insects are crawling; or itching along the eyes, mouth sores, and tongue ulcers, severe enough to cause a feeling of a closed throat; or lumps around the neck that resemble throat cancer but are not; or a sensation in the chest and abdomen as if two energies are intertwined, causing obstruction and discomfort, like smoke rising, with a feeling of heat in the head and face; or feelings of despair, madness, paralysis from stroke; or conditions like exhaustion, wind-dampness, or beriberi; or palpitations and anxiety beneath the heart, akin to fearing capture; or wheezing, coughing, and vomiting; or the vomiting of cold saliva, green water, or black water, which may indicate lung abscess, intestinal toxicity, or severe complications with pus and spasms.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All internal and external diseases arise from phlegm. When fluids become thick and turn into phlegm and drinking, they surge upwards causing dryness of the mouth and throat. When they flow downwards, they block the flow of urine and feces, leading to a face that appears like dry bones and hair that is charred and dry. In women, this results in blocked menstruation, while in children, it can cause convulsions and seizures. The treatment should first focus on expelling the bad phlegm, then consider the condition&#39;s deficiency or excess to adjust the therapy. Therefore, the formulation of the &quot;Rolling Phlegm Pill&quot; is crucial for addressing phlegm and fluid issues in the three burn areas. It seems to me that many treatise are thorough, yet if they do not differentiate between deficiency and excess, and simply use harsh medicines, they might not truly address the core issue. There are differences in constitution; the severity of disease can vary. A misstep may lead to greater complications. Danxi said: Excessive use of draining medicines for phlegm can weaken the spleen&#39;s energy, causing phlegm to easily recur. He also stated that in cases where phlegm and food stagnation occur in the middle burner, the stomach qi needs nurturing; thus, it should not be recklessly attacked. If the attack is too severe, the condition may worsen and become more deficient. The &quot;Rolling Phlegm Pill&quot; should only be given to those with strong vital energy and substantial phlegm accumulation. It must not be used lightly on individuals with weak energy.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essential Strategies for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ceasing Consumption to Resolve Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>There are six types of fluids: suspended, overflowing, obstructed, phlegmatic, retained, and latent. Phlegm-damp is merely one of these six types. When a person suffers from a condition referred to as phlegm-damp, it is generally due to prolonged stagnation, leading to the accumulation of phlegm, often caused by blockages in the airways resulting in the obstruction of bodily fluids. This can be likened to a blocked ditch where water accumulates and stagnates, causing backflow and leading to foul, corrupted smells.</p>
<p>If one does not open up the ditch but instead seeks to clear and purify the stagnant water, it is illogical. Conditions such as wheezing, coughing, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, palpitations, chills and fevers, painful swelling, distended epigastrium, or sounds of fluid in the chest and sides, or a sensation of coolness in the back and heart—all result from the dampness, reminiscent of the foul, corrupted water.</p>
<p>Therefore, a good treatment for phlegm involves focusing on the qi rather than directly addressing the phlegm. When qi is regulated, the bodily fluids will follow suit. It is advisable to use a combination of Suzi Jiangqi Decoction and Phlegm-Guide Decoction, both in equal parts. Alternatively, one may utilize Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction, adding Zhi Shi and Mu Xiang in equal weight, taken in five pill doses, or prepare a dosage of five pills brewed as a potion, which is especially effective.</p>
<p>In general, if there are no other issues and only a few phlegmatic symptoms, whether clear or viscous, it is recommended to use Er Chen Decoction or Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction. If phlegm is abundant, intermittently taking Qingzhou White Pills mixed with Lai Fudan is beneficial.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>For anyone with phlegm, there will certainly be dark ash-black discoloration on the eyelids and under the eyes, easily observable without pulse diagnosis. Dark eyes and flushed cheeks indicate hot phlegm; a large yellow face also suggests hot phlegm. The external signs will surely include fullness and heat in the chest, a dry mouth with a longing for coolness, constipated stools, and red hot urine. Prolonged conditions may lead to wind, dizziness, tinnitus, and visual disturbances, with many signs of deficiency. When treating, the use of warming drugs is required; prolonged use will certainly lead to a large, strong pulse, can cause extreme heat and stroke, and should be addressed urgently. </p>
<p>If the eyes are dark and walking is labored with groans, this indicates phlegm that has entered the bones. Symptoms include pain throughout the body and joints. Dark eyes with a muddy complexion, weakness in the limbs, and difficulty in bending and stretching point to wind-damp phlegm. Dark eyes with shortness of breath signify phlegm due to shock. A large pulse on both sides of the radial artery indicates the presence of phlegm in the chest, which may be expelled; if the patient fears vomiting, use an enema instead. </p>
<p>For anyone with a cold sensation along the spine resembling a line, it is advisable to induce vomiting or use a purgative. If patients have ailments that are unresponsive to numerous medicines, and their pulse is hidden yet strong, it indicates phlegm; in this case, use the Miao Ying Pill. </p>
<p>Modification principles: for shock phlegm, add two qian of cinnabar and two whole scorpions, taking eight or nine pills regularly; for alcohol-associated phlegm, add two qian each of realgar and whole scorpion, taking ten pills each time; for hot phlegm, add equal parts of gypsum powder, taking three to six pills each time; for cold phlegm, add equal parts of pepper, cloves, scorpion, and cinnamon, taking twenty-five pills each time.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

Symptoms include dizziness as if seated in a boat, a wandering spirit, twitching of the mouth and eyes, itchiness in the eyebrows, ears, and every part of the body; swelling and hardness in the jaw and limbs, resembling pain yet not quite so. The whole body feels dry and itchy, scratching brings forth itchy rashes, the skin feels hot like fire, with a color resembling brocade. The teeth and gums may feel itchy or painful, with pain shifting unpredictably. The mouth feels full of floating teeth, with pain and itchiness varying, belching sourness, smelling burnt, feeling a bean-like scent in the throat, causing annoyance and nasal obstruction, with difficulty swallowing or expelling, sometimes expelled by sneezing or salivating when in motion.

<p>At times, the heart feels as if ice or iron is lodged inside, causing stagnation and oppression, leading to repeated belching and symptoms resembling phlegm in the diaphragm.

Other dreams may entail flames with smoke surrounding, with the smell of burning bones and no clear path to exit. Sometimes, there may not be an external trigger, yet feelings of anger and sorrow arise, with tears raining down upon waking. </p>
<p>Occasionally, while wandering outdoors, one may see two moons shining together at the horizon or multiple beams of golden light, only to turn and find nothing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Old Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm is a term for a disease. When a person&#39;s qi and blood are clear and flowing, bodily fluids circulate properly, and there is no phlegm. However, when qi and blood become turbid and stagnant, bodily fluids do not clear, leading to their accumulation and transformation into phlegm. The root of phlegm is water, originating in the kidneys. The activity of phlegm is linked to dampness, primarily governed by the spleen. The ancients used Erchen Decoction as a general remedy for phlegm because it strengthens the spleen and dries dampness, thus treating the symptoms. It is indeed effective for damp phlegm, cold phlegm, phlegm fluids, and phlegm saliva. </p>
<p>If phlegm is caused by fire rising, causing the lung qi to become obstructed, leading to coughing during this time, and there is old, accumulated phlegm that forms into thick blocks, making it difficult to expel, this phlegm is all due to the fire evil rising, affecting the upper jiao, and obstructing the lung qi. Thus, the bodily fluids that follow the qi rise are steamed by fire, becoming turbid and stagnated. Over years, it becomes deeply rooted, hence called old phlegm or obstructed phlegm, and its essence is fire.</p>
<p>The illness resides in the upper jiao, particularly between the heart and lungs, and the throat, unlike the damp phlegm of the middle jiao&#39;s spleen and stomach, cold phlegm, phlegm fluids, or phlegm saliva, making it difficult to treat with decoctions. It cannot be cured with herbs like Pinellia, Poria, Atractylodes, Zhiqiao, and Nanjing. Instead, the focus should be on relieving obstruction, lowering fire, clearing and moistening the lung metal, and dissolving the accumulated phlegm to treat it gently and effectively.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Phlegm: New and Old Distinction</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm is formed from bodily fluids and blood, rising and falling with the Qi. When Qi and blood are harmonious, phlegm flows and does not accumulate; if there is internal or external injury, it can become blocked and cause problems. Fresh and light phlegm appears bluish-white, thin, and has a mild taste. Old and heavy phlegm is yellow, turbid, thick, sticky, and hard to expel, gradually becoming foul-tasting with sour, spicy, fishy, greasy, salty, and bitter notes. In the initial stages of phlegm symptoms, there may be headaches and fever, resembling an exterior pathogenic condition; if it persists, there could be tidal fevers at night, resembling internal injury from Yin fire. Additionally, if phlegm fluid causes pain in the limbs and joints, it resembles a wind condition. However, in cases of phlegm-induced chest fullness and reduced appetite, the skin color remains the same, and the pulse is slippery, irregular, and unstable, indicating a different condition.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p>People know that qi and blood can cause illness, but they are unaware that phlegm diseases are even more numerous. When phlegm originates in the spleen, it may lead to fatigue in the limbs, abdominal pain, swelling, and diarrhea, known as damp phlegm. If combined with food stagnation and blood stasis, it can form nodules and masses, called food phlegm. If it lingers in the stomach region, it may cause frequent vomiting and acid regurgitation, with an uneasy sensation rising, as well as heat in the head and face, referred to as hot phlegm. If it arises from drinking alcohol, it may result in dry heaving, belching, and pain in the sides, known as alcohol phlegm. When it originates in the lungs, it may cause a dry cough, paleness like withered bones, along with dryness in the throat and mouth, referred to as dry phlegm, which can develop into chronic phlegm or stagnant phlegm over time. Moreover, emotional disturbances can cause phlegm to obstruct the throat and diaphragm, leading to fullness in the chest and sides, known as qi phlegm. If it confuses the heart, it may lead to palpitations, madness, and strange dreams, referred to as heat phlegm. If it affects the liver, it may cause dizziness and headaches, shaking of the eyes, itching of the ears, pain in the sides, paralysis on one side, numbness, and odd symptoms, called wind phlegm. Accumulated in the kidneys, it may lead to soreness and weakness in the legs and knees, stiffness and pain in the lower back, coldness in the limbs, joint pain, known as cold phlegm, also referred to as deficient phlegm.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Heat Phlegm:</strong> This is caused by rich foods building up heat, or externally caused erroneous warmth, resulting in yellow sputum, which may contain blood or appear purple. Use Qingqi Huatan Wan boiled to take, or Da Jin Hua Wan and Gun Tan Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Phlegm:</strong> This results from consuming thick foods and bedding, which steams the body&#39;s fluids, creating thick and turbid phlegm. Use Er Chen Tang with additions of Qinqin, Lian, and Shan Zhi, or suppressing pills and moistening pills.</p>
<p><strong>Stagnant Phlegm:</strong> This is prolonged fire phlegm trapped in the heart and lungs, leading to blockage in the chest and difficult expectoration. Avoid drying drugs like Nanshing and Banxia; it is best to open appetite, lower fire, clear metal, and nourish the lungs gently during treatment. Use Jie Zhai Huatan Wan, Xie Fu Qingjin Wan, Dan Bei Mu Wan, and Xia Tian Gao.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Phlegm:</strong> This arises from emotional stagnation, leading to difficulty in expectoration or swallowing. The phlegm resembles broken cotton or plum pits. Use Si Qi Tang. For prolonged cases, omit Su Zi, and use Huang Qin, Shan Zhi, or Hai Shi. Use San Xian Wan and Qian Jin Zhi Mi Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Diet and Alcohol as Cause</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diet Phlegm:</strong> This occurs from undigested food, resulting in blockages. Use Ju Ban Zhi Shu Wan. For sputum causing wheezing and urgency, use Lou Shi Wan or Shan Zha Mai Ya Tang. For those with Yin deficiency, use Huang Bai Wan. If there is a hard feeling in the heart cavity like a cup, this is named Qi Fen; use Zhi Zhu Wan boiled to take.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Phlegm and fluids have five types.</p>
<p>Phlegm accumulates in the channels, coming out through the lungs as a cough; saliva accumulates in the spleen, flowing from the corners of the mouth; fluid arises in the stomach, being expelled from the epigastrium. The five types of fluids and six symptoms, together with retained fluids and hidden fluids, form a single entity. All of this is due to the retention of water and tea or wine, combined with external pathogens causing cold, and emotions clashing to produce phlegm. In cases where phlegm from alcohol persists and dampness prevails, it closely resembles the water condition in severe cold, with a pulse often being wiry and slippery or hidden, and the skin under the eyes appearing dark and ashen.</p>
<p>Phlegm and fluids cause stagnation in the intestines and stomach, leading to rumbling sounds in the abdomen, resulting in dramatic weight gain or loss; suspended fluids cause water to flow in the flanks, resulting in pain when coughing or spitting; overflowing fluids cause water to flow into the limbs, resulting in heavy body pain; stagnant fluids cause water to accumulate above the diaphragm (in cases of food inability), leading to shortness of breath; retained fluids cause water to stagnate below the heart, resulting in a chilling sensation like a cold hand, possible shortness of breath and thirst, and joint pains in the limbs. Pain in the flanks radiates to the back, and coughing increases; hidden fluids cause water to stagnate and fullness of the diaphragm, leading to vomiting, coughing, fever with chills, back pain, tearing, or shivering. </p>
<p>Zhongjing treats various fluids under the skin and in the channels with the Xiao Qinglong Decoction; those in the chest and diaphragm are treated with Guadi Powder; those in the limbs and channels are treated with Wuling Powder; and those in the intestines and stomach are treated with Shizao Decoction.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

If phlegm accumulation leads to counterflow, Suzi Jiangqi Decoction, Sansheng Drink, or Gu Liu Gong Dan should be employed. If the spleen is deficient and unable to transform, it is advisable to tonify and dry dampness with Liujunzi Decoction, adding Zhuli and ginger juice.

Alternatively, use Shen Qi Wan or San Yi Shen Qi Wan. It is said: phlegm has no nourishment method. Moreover, chronic phlegm is congealed and sticky; it cannot be resolved without temporarily using warming herbs to guide it, otherwise there will be a risk of obstruction. When wind and cold phlegm and qi are internally constrained, not using warming dispersants, how can one open up the stagnation? These issues cannot be strictly confined to a lack of nourishment. Generally, when phlegm causes wheezing with a loud voice, pulse is scattered, and sweat is profuse like oil, the body feels cold, it can lead to death. </p>
<p>Phlegm is the transformation of bodily fluids; wind injures the lungs, and dampness injures the spleen, congealing and becoming turbid. Externally, symptoms manifest as discomfort in the head and neck, resembling cold and heat causing a febrile disease. Initially, there is fullness and oppression in the chest, qi rushes up to the throat, with a floating pulse indicating abnormality. If there is heat, use Shen Su Yin, Jin Fei Cao San, or Chai Hu Ban Xia Tang; if there is no heat, use Er Chen Tang or Wen Dan Tang. Phlegm-dispelling decoction can be used broadly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>Thick and turbid substances are phlegm, while clear and thin ones are fluids. In discussing phlegm diseases, six or seven out of ten cases arise, and the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; describes four categories of phlegm and fluid, all due to the harm caused by damp earth. Thus, the sages say: the spleen is the source of phlegm, and also state: treating phlegm without addressing the spleen and stomach is not proper treatment. When fluids enter the stomach, they flow out nourishing energy, which ascends to the spleen. The spleen&#39;s energy disperses this essence, which returns to the lungs, regulating the water pathways and then descending to the bladder. The essence of water distributes evenly, and the five meridians function seamlessly; how can there be phlegm? Only when the spleen&#39;s earth is deficient and damp, does the clear fail to rise and the turbid fail to descend, becoming trapped and stagnant, thus forming phlegm. Therefore, to treat phlegm, one must first tonify the spleen; when the spleen regains its regular function, phlegm will naturally resolve. In summary, phlegm can be categorized into five types, and fluids also have five types, with treatment methods varying accordingly.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is also a type that is neither phlegm nor fluid, which sometimes produces white foam that is not very thick or sticky. This is due to the spleen being weak and unable to control the fluids, leading to the spontaneous production of saliva and foam. It is advisable to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with the addition of Galangal seeds to restrain it. Alas! The five types of phlegm and five types of fluids are all different, and their treatments are entirely distinct. If one does not understand this clearly and recklessly administers medications, it is not only ineffective but may also cause harm. Particularly, the phlegm from the spleen and lungs must not be mixed. The spleen is associated with damp earth, favoring warmth and dryness while disliking coldness and moisture, thus the two Atractylodes (zhuzhu) and Poria are essential medicines. The lung, being associated with dry metal, prefers coolness and moisture while disliking warmth and dryness, so the two Mothers (Ophiopogon) and the herbs of the two winters, Rehmannia, and Platycodon are key medicines. The treatment for them is relatively easy and rarely leads to complications. In common practice, people dislike the drying effect of Pinellia and prefer the moistening effect of Fritillaria, immediately using Fritillaria upon seeing phlegm. However, if it is spleen phlegm, the earth aspect is further damaged, and food intake suddenly declines; even if it is lung phlegm, one should not use too much cooling moisture as it could hurt the middle qi. One should slightly employ spleen herbs to nourish lung metal for effective treatment. Thus, it is said that treating phlegm without addressing the spleen and stomach is not the correct approach.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>Wang Jiezhai says: The origin of phlegm is water, stemming from the kidneys. The movement of phlegm is due to dampness, which is under the control of the spleen. In ancient times, the Er Chen Decoction was commonly used to treat phlegm, specifically for damp phlegm and cold phlegm. However, when the yin fire rises and affects the upper burner, obstructing the lung qi, the fluids that rise with the qi condense into phlegm, which becomes thick, foul, and in severe cases, can even be blood-streaked. This is not comparable to the damp phlegm and cold phlegm of the middle burner, nor can it be treated with Banxia, Zhike, or Nansheng. Only by using clear qi to transform phlegm can there be effective results. Alas! Jiezhai discusses phlegm, and initially identifies its fundamental source in the kidneys, which can be considered an insight not previously uncovered. Unfortunately, while he touches upon the topic, he does not complete the discussion. The remedies he proposes are primarily for symptomatic treatment, and among them, there are many cooling substances that often cause harm to the stomach.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhongjing said: When there is deficient qi with phlegm, use Shenqi pill to tonify and expel it. Wu Jiaoshan in &quot;Differentiating Various Conditions&quot; also stated: The Eight-Treasure pill addresses the root of phlegm. These two scholars truly enlighten later learners who suffer silently, alleviating countless ailments. Phlegm is a term for illness and is not an inherent part of the human body; it is not simply water turned into phlegm nor water boiling into phlegm; rather, it must differentiate between the presence of fire and the absence of water.</p>
<p>When kidney deficiency cannot control water, it fails to return to its source, leading to water flowing backward, and a flood-like situation results in phlegm—this is the absence of fire. Hence, the Eight-Treasure pill is used to tonify kidney fire. When yin is deficient and fire is active, water boils over; if it is moving in the kidneys, it is like dragon fire emerging from the sea—where the dragon rises, water follows; if it is stirring in the liver, it is akin to thunderfire erupting from the earth, causing strong winds and torrential rains; water surges and turns into phlegm—this is phlegm with fire. Thus, the Six-Treasure pill is utilized to complement the fire.</p>
<p>This does not target the symptoms of phlegm but addresses its root cause. However, how can one differentiate between phlegm with and without fire? It is said: Without fire, it is simply clear water; with fire, it contains heavy and turbid white froth. Those who are good at using these methods can first apply the Six-Treasure and Eight-Treasure pills to strengthen the source of water and benefit the original fire; then they can use the Four Gentlemen or Six Gentlemen formulas to tonify the spleen to control water.</p>
<p>For spleen deficiency, not only is the middle strengthened, but the Six-Treasure and Eight-Treasure pills can also control water and nourish the mother. The mutual generation and overcoming between mother and child suggest that we can approach the treatment of phlegm effectively.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Pang An often said: When there is insufficient yin fluid and the fire of yin rises, the lungs suffer from the heat and cannot properly descend and clear. Consequently, the fluids become thickened and turbid, resulting in phlegm without producing blood. One should use moistening agents, such as Ophiopogon, Rehmannia, and Goji berries, to nourish the yin, allowing the rising fire to return to its dwelling and rest, thereby clearing the phlegm on its own. If two treasures are applied, one will quickly see its effectiveness. </p>
<p>In cases of kidney deficiency unable to gather qi, the qi flows out without being retained, leading to accumulation; if this accumulation does not disperse, phlegm will arise, and the Eight Herb Pill addresses this. The &quot;Mengquan&quot; states: Rehmannia mud can create phlegm, making it a restricted medicine, which should be stir-fried with ginger juice. Alas! If stir-fried with ginger juice, it becomes spicy and dry, rendering the Rehmannia ineffective. Rehmannia is primarily valued for its moistening properties and its ability to enter the kidney channel. If mixed with spleen and stomach medicines, which dislike dampness, how can it not create phlegm? The various ingredients in the Eight Herb and Six Herb Pills are all medicines of the lesser yin channel, working together to directly reach the lower jiao; hence they are known as the sacred medicine for phlegm generated by water. It should be taken on an empty stomach, followed by a nutritious meal, without lingering in the stomach. This is the wonderful principle of formulations established by Zhang Zhongjing, so why must we remain doubtful?<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Phlegm and Fluid Disorders</strong> </p>
<p>Phlegm and fluid disorders are a major concern, affecting seven or eight people out of every ten. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; texts elaborate on this matter in great detail, categorizing and naming the different types. Later generations, overwhelmed by the multitude of names, often lose sight of their fundamental essence, failing to consider that the sages established laws from a single source without divergence. </p>
<p>The stomach serves as the sea for food and water, and is the main source for the five organs and six bowels. Sustenance enters the stomach, where it nourishes and energizes the body, ascending to the spleen. The spleen then disseminates the energy and returns it to the lungs, regulating the pathways of water before ultimately descending to the bladder. The essence of water disperses throughout the body, and the five meridians operate harmoniously, which is the norm for healthy individuals. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; speaks of the disorders arising when the essence of water does not disperse properly, and the five meridians do not operate in unison. </p>
<p>Water is the most precious element in the human body. Heaven gives rise to water, which circulates everywhere without exception. If there is stagnation, it is like the low-lying parts of rivers where refuse accumulates, the waterways become narrow, and overflow occurs, which cannot be avoided. One must follow the natural tendencies and guide the flow, from high mountains to plains, and from plains to oceans, in order to avoid flooding.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, Zhongjing distinguishes between the shallow and deep to teach people, naming them to seek their meanings. The shallow pertains to within the body but outside the organs, and it has four names: phlegm flu, suspended fluid, overflowing fluid, and constrained fluid. Phlegm flu is when water moves in the intestines, making a dripping sound; suspended fluid is when water flows under the ribs, causing pain when coughing or expectorating; overflowing fluid is when water flows in the limbs, preventing sweating and resulting in a heavy feeling in the body; constrained fluid is when one coughs, has difficulty breathing, and presents a swollen appearance. </p>
<p>One type flows from the stomach down to the intestines, another flows from the stomach out to the sides, another flows out to the limbs, and another ascends from the stomach into the chest and diaphragm. Initially, one does not notice it; as days and months accumulate, the essence of water turns turbid, eventually forming phlegm flu. It first gathers in the places difficult for breath to access, thus flowing from the intestines to the sides and limbs, gradually saturating the chest and diaphragm, with its effects becoming more pronounced. The problem of phlegm flu has invariably originated from the stomach. The deeper issues ascend from the stomach into the Yang regions, gradually affecting the heart and lungs; from the stomach descending into the Yin regions, gradually affecting the spleen, liver, and kidneys.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, when water resides in the heart, it strengthens the spirit below, creating shortness of breath; one does not wish to drink this bad water. When water attacks from the outside, fire diminishes, causing the water to become firmer. When fire is blocked internally, the breath constricts, leading to this shortness of breath. Fire and water are enemies, hence one does not drink it.</p>
<p>When water is in the lungs, it produces spittle and foam, creating a desire to drink water. This is because the lungs govern qi, circulate nourishment, and distribute fluids. When water evil enters, it obstructs the qi pathways, causing the qi to condense and fluids to gather, transforming into spittle and foam, losing its clarity; thus, one resorts to drinking water for relief.</p>
<p>When water is in the spleen, there is a lack of qi, and the body feels heavy, as the spleen dislikes dampness. If dampness prevails, vitality diminishes, and the body feels heavy.</p>
<p>When water is in the liver, there is fullness beneath the ribs, causing sneezing and pain, as the liver is related to the gallbladder, with their meridians running alongside the ribs. When the fire qi surges to the nose, it causes sneezing, and tension in the ribs results in pain.</p>
<p>When water is in the kidneys, there is a palpitation below the heart, as kidney water overwhelms the heart, creating discomfort. It is not merely a pit of neighborly drink.</p>
<p>The five organs are where the spirit resides. When water accumulates, it manifests as phlegm and fluids, enveloping from the outside.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ultimately, the areas where water accumulates are called &quot;retained drinks,&quot; as they remain and do not leave. When retained drinks are present but do not exhaust completely, they are called &quot;hidden drinks,&quot; as they hide and do not emerge. Following the various phlegm and drinks that are either retained or hidden, and treating them according to their nature, is the essence of proper method. Let me explain it further.</p>
<p>From the stomach upward through the divisions of the chest, diaphragm, heart, and lungs, one should drive those retained drinks back to the stomach and eliminate them, either through the intestines below or vomiting above. Such expulsions are direct and satisfying, and do not lead to hiding. This is known by all. If the drinks exit through the skin, the clear ones may surface as sweat, while the turbid cannot escape and must inevitably return to the chest and diaphragm. From the chest and diaphragm, they should return to the stomach before they can enter the intestines and be expelled. Driving them out must involve hidden drinks within the skin that resist expulsion. </p>
<p>If they are deeply stored in the back, which serves as a cavity for the chest, there is even less opportunity for escape, and they must return to the chest and diaphragm before they can proceed to the stomach and intestines for proper downward movement. It is not only that they resist expulsion, but there is also the dangerous excessive yang heat implicated, which can lead to sores and poisons that accumulate like an orange pouch. </p>
<p>The difficulty in expelling hidden drinks can easily lead to harm; who can discern and resolve this? I, Chang, apply calm reasoning and speak on medical practice, with firm evidence, carefully based on the secret text of the &quot;Golden Coffer,&quot; directly imparting the golden needle technique, urging the heirs of medical practitioners to refine their understanding and further pursue precision in their craft.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on the Pulse of Phlegm and Fluid</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of phlegm and fluid, as mentioned in the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; varies inconsistently, making it difficult to interpret comprehensively. In my humble opinion, there are also differences in depth and severity, which can be clarified. The section on important pulse subtleties states: the liver pulse is soft and scattered; in terms of color, it indicates the presence of excessive fluid. Excessive fluid refers to extreme thirst and frequent drinking, which easily enters the muscles, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. This specifically highlights the condition of excessive drinking as the most superficial manifestation of drinking-related illness. Zhang Jing understood this concept and categorized the symptoms of fluid retention into four types, summarizing them as: phlegm fluid, suspended fluid, overflowing fluid, and restrained fluid, generally discussed from shallow to deep in treatment. Failing to address this and allowing it to escalate into a flood of accumulated fluids means that these four types cannot be discussed in the same manner. The pulse of fluid that is not taut, but merely indicates pain and shortness of breath, refers to the true pulse of fluid. If the fluid pulse is not taut, this suggests that the accumulation of water is not significant; however, it still harms the yang energy, leading only to mild shortness of breath.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that when there is edema, the patient may wheeze and be unable to lie down, experiencing shortness of breath. When the pulse is still steady, and one observes the edema rising to the chest and diaphragm, accompanied by wheezing and shortness of breath, with a pulse that remains steady, it may seem present yet is nearly absent, showing only a slight accumulation, not yet settled deeply, hence not evident in the pulse. It is said that if the pulse is floating, thin, and slippery, it indicates injury from fluid intake; this floating, thin, and slippery pulse is not similar to that from wind-cold, but rather is due to the initial stagnation of fluid, which has not penetrated deeply yet. At this time, the physician should urgently consider the dangers of stagnation and promptly activate the body&#39;s own elimination, employing strategies according to the circumstances, which would resolve the issue. Otherwise, if the condition deepens and the final portion of the illness separates more, the root becomes increasingly difficult to diagnose. Year after year, if one merely inspects formulas and seeks remedies without success, can success be achieved? Therefore, whenever one observes the pulse turning deep and string-like, one should apply appropriate methods to investigate. When it is said that the pulse is deep, it indicates the presence of retained fluid in the chest, leading to shortness of breath and thirst. This results in pain in the limbs and joints, indicating that the lung&#39;s ability to regulate is not functioning, and the vital energy is not dispersing, hence the shortness of breath; without the dispersal of energy, the fluids do not transform, resulting in dry phlegm and thirst; if the spleen&#39;s energy is not moving, the fluid accumulates in the joints, causing pain.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This evidence suggests that there is a mutual disease between the lungs and spleen. The so-called fluids entering the stomach and spreading their essence upward to the spleen, dispersing the spleen&#39;s energy and ascending to the lungs, is a common occurrence. If one then resorts to hiring soldiers and stealing grain to seek peace, can such tranquility be obtained? Concerning the pulse characteristics: it is said that a cough corresponds to a string-like pulse, indicating the presence of fluids; a double string-like pulse denotes cold, often resulting from a significant depletion after a purge; a pulse that is slightly string-like indicates fluid retention, leading to wheezing and fullness; a rapid string-like pulse indicates cold fluids, which are hard to treat in winter and summer; a deep and string-like pulse suggests hanging fluids causing internal pain. This describes the accumulation of water, addressing the urgent fluid retention and broadening the explanation. Aside from significant purges, a double string-like pulse indicates a difference between deficiency and cold, while a slightly string-like pulse indicates fluid retention. The difficulty in treatment during winter and summer stems from the use of cold methods for cold conditions and hot methods for heat conditions, making spring and autumn far more conducive to treatment. The internal pain from hanging fluids refers to a substantial accumulation of such fluids, leading to pain in severe cases.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is also a deep and tight pulse, indicating a firm mass beneath the heart and a dark complexion, signifying water accompanied by kidney cold, mixed in the heart and lungs. This leads to a firm sensation below the heart and a dark complexion. If the pulse is hidden, it is a sign of retained fluids, where accumulated fluids hold the pulse and do not reveal themselves, being even more pronounced than a thin pulse. Moreover, when the pulse is hidden yet smooth, it indicates that the retained fluid wants to disperse. If there has been a persistent cough for several years, a weak pulse can be treated, but a strong and full pulse signifies death; a weak pulse will inevitably suffer from phantasms because there is already retained fluid in the chest. All these indicate that the disease is deep and the pulse has changed, requiring one to trace its flow and investigate its source thoroughly. When the heavenly pivot opens and the stomach is harmonized, the pulse is smooth. However, if phlegm and fluids are condensed within, the mechanisms of opening and closing are not functioning properly, and the pulse transforms into deep, taut, rapid, biased, numerous, or tense forms, or may even be hidden and unseen. Without urgently removing the phlegm and fluids, how can the pulse return to its normal state? Those with shallow conditions can be treated lightly; those with deep conditions require deep treatment, and those between shallow and deep should be treated accordingly. Retained fluids can be attacked, hidden ones can be guided, and firm ones can be dispersed. If one continues to follow past practices, the disease deepens with no energy, leading to sudden distress; at that point, it is beyond the reach of medicine.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Retained Phlegm and Fluids</strong></p>
<p>The conditions of retained phlegm and fluids have two meanings that are particularly difficult to understand. To discuss retained fluids refers to those that remain and do not disperse, while hidden fluids are those that remain concealed within. Retained fluids can eventually leave, while hidden fluids will never depart; thus, the meanings of retention and concealment begin to become clearer. The profound meaning of the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; cannot be fully expressed in mere words, and so I will explain it again. In the &quot;Golden Coffer,&quot; there are three observations on retained fluids and one on hidden fluids. It states: when there is retained fluid below the heart, the person feels cold in the back, as if the size of a palm. Secondly: retained fluid causes pain in the side and pulls toward the lower abdomen. Thirdly: when there is retained fluid in the chest, the person experiences shortness of breath and thirst, with pain in the joints of the limbs. Speaking of retained fluid in the chest, it obstructs and represses the yang of the upper jiao, namely the heart and lungs, leading to a yin stagnation. Thus, for those with deep cold in the back, there is only cold without heat, which obstructs the upward movement of the governing vessel&#39;s yang, resulting in cold in the back like the size of a palm, all of which is merely a manifestation of internal stagnation of the yang fire.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The channels of the hand-foot Jueyin run below the ribs, and the channel of the foot Shaoyang passes through the diaphragm and the lateral ribs. Therefore, pain in the side is linked to the diaphragm and is a sign of retained phlegm obstructing the movement of wood and fire. When phlegm is retained in the chest, it causes shortness of breath and thirst, while the limbs ache at the joints, indicating a failure of the lungs to circulate qi and of the spleen to disperse essence. When viewed altogether, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and phlegm are all capable of retention and burdening one another—this meaning does not change.</p>
<p>As for the retained phlegm, it manifests as phlegm in the upper diaphragm, fullness with dyspnea, coughing, and expectoration. It may lead to alternating chills and fever, back pain, waist pain, and tears streaming from the eyes. The afflicted person often shows signs of tremors and severe twitching; there must be retained phlegm present.</p>
<p>The heart and lungs govern the chest, and when phlegm retention obstructs the yang qi, it cannot be mobilized. Nonetheless, heavy yin is ultimately difficult to conceal; sometimes the yang extends, with no accommodation for yin, leading to sudden vomiting or expulsion, allowing the retained phlegm to emerge. If further withholding occurs without expulsion, it indicates that the three yang energies are extending and retracting again.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

When the lesser yang does not extend, the transformation of wind and fire becomes constrained and blends within the broad yang of the earth. The broad yang governs the muscles, leading to trembling of the body and intense suffering. If the retained fluids do not disperse, the burden becomes even greater. However, for the treatment of retained fluids, Zhongjing does not mention a method. If one seeks to control the excessive yang of the four organs and three cavities, then using warming herbs to harmonize should address this condition, shouldn’t it? The Decoction of Poria, Cinnamon, Atractylodes, and Licorice is meant to treat fullness in the chest and dizziness; does this not align with the understanding of this condition and can it not be applied accordingly?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Later generations do not understand the principles of the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; and arbitrarily create theories of the five types of fluid accumulation and six signs. They, with a shallow understanding, apply the teachings regarding fluid accumulation, stating: first, heart retention; second, side retention; third, phlegm retention in the stomach; fourth, overflow retention above the diaphragm; fifth, hanging retention in the intestines. They propose a unified treatment for all, how superficial this is!</p>
<p>Note that phlegm retention is fundamentally one condition, but there are two causes. Phlegm arises from fire, characterized by heat without cold; fluid retention, on the other hand, is due to dampness, characterized by both heat and cold, maintaining that there are warm springs without cold fire. When the body is heated and agitated internally, the qi and blood stagnate, causing the essential fluids to steam and congeal into phlegm, an expression of fire.</p>
<p>Water comes from dampness, lingering and unconsumed, accumulating into fluid retention. Ultimately, cases of fluid retention primarily arise from the combination of heat and dampness, with fewer cases resulting from cold and dampness. Dampness lacks a fixed form; in spring it is termed wind-damp, in summer hot-damp, in autumn dry-damp, and in winter cold-damp. Three seasons are dominated by heat, while one season is dominated by cold, with heat-damp conditions occurring three times more frequently than cold-damp.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; when dampness and earth excessively dominate, phlegm retention can become a disease, treated with various heat remedies, not implying that phlegm retention is cold in nature. Later generations do not understand this and recklessly use heat medications as a pretext. What they fail to realize is that to treat the six external pathogens, one must first resolve external disturbances. Thus, to address the dominance of dampness, it is also necessary to warm the exterior to disperse its pathological influences, and when attacking internally, it will not stray far from cold either.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, at the beginning, there can be no outward expression, and the accumulation of yin blocks the yang within the body, it is necessary to employ warmth to promote the yang for the yin pathogens to swiftly depart.

<p>&quot;The Lesser Learning&quot; discusses the method of differentiating between deficiency and excess, stating that the origin of illness is due to external influences and internal damage, leading to the generation of fire, dampness, damp-heat, and phlegm—these are the only four causes. </p>
<p>When assessing recent illnesses in the young, if it is dampness, we should dry it; if it is fire, we should purge it. If dampness generates heat, we should dry the dampness while simultaneously clearing heat. If fire produces phlegm, we should drain the fire while also dispersing the phlegm, ensuring no residue remains. </p>
<p>In examining the elderly or those with chronic illnesses, one should apply both attacking and tonifying methods. For instance, if there is qi deficiency with damp-heat phlegm-fire, one would use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to tonify qi while simultaneously drying dampness, clearing heat, dispersing phlegm, and draining fire; if there is blood deficiency with phlegm-fire damp-heat, one would use the Four-substances Decoction to tonify blood while also draining fire, dispersing phlegm, clearing heat, and drying dampness. </p>
<p>In this way, a combination of attacking and tonifying methods is appropriate and should be feasible.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus it is said: In the young and robust, new ailments should be examined by attacking the pathogenic factors; in the old and frail, nourishing and tonifying remedies should take precedence. As for the deficiency of Yin leading to excessive fire, and the weakness of the spleen and stomach, the true Yin is akin to water, while the spleen and stomach correspond to earth. Though earth prefers dryness, excessive heat will cause plants to wither. Likewise, though wood thrives in moisture, too much humidity leads to rot. Therefore, when using remedies to tonify the spleen and nourish the kidneys, it is essential to balance dryness and dampness, adjusting them according to varying conditions.</p>
<p>Later generations treat phlegm and fluid retention with four methods: strengthening the spleen, drying dampness, reducing fire, and promoting Qi circulation. To strengthen the spleen and dry dampness, the formulas of Er Chen and Er Zhur are most suitable, though they should be avoided if there&#39;s Yin deficiency. For reducing fire, it is necessary to differentiate between deficiency and excess; bitter-cold herbs are used for excess, while sweet-cold is applied for deficiency. </p>
<p>As for Qi-moving herbs, one must avoid random selection without principle. The cold and wind pathogens invade from the outside and envelop the phlegm and fluids; using Xiao Qing Long Tang can disperse the evil externally while expelling phlegm and fluids downward. The turbid Yang Qi enters from below and entraps the phlegm and fluids; employing Fu Ling Hou Po Tang will allow the turbid Qi to descend and the phlegm and fluids to rise.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To establish a definitive method that everyone can utilize, why insist solely on promoting Zihe? Zihe necessarily considers the individual&#39;s condition before inducing vomiting. If one attempt does not suffice, one waits and tries again, easing into it gradually. The method of expelling phlegm through vomiting indeed has its own control and release, so it is clear that it is not used recklessly. Further discussion reveals that the &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot; employs methods of sweating, inducing vomiting, purging, and harmonizing with warming techniques. When it comes to phlegm and fluids, it is essential to address vomiting first; however, Zhang Zhongjing does not mention it. Why is this? The term &quot;vomit&quot; is used because phlegm and fluids rise as a result of internal pressure and overflow from within. If one states that inducing vomiting does not lead to recovery, it does not blame the act of vomiting itself. Moreover, it is said that those prone to vomiting are fundamentally thirsty, and thirst prompts the desire to relieve it, suggesting reliance on vomiting for relief. Why is there no clear mention that one should vomit? Zhang Zhongjing implies that within the evidence of phlegm and fluid syndrome, there are many mixed symptoms of counterflow, dizziness, etc.; inducing vomiting might be risky, hence he does not elaborate on it, refraining from making it a fundamental method to avoid leading future generations astray, thereby establishing himself as the founding father of this methodology. Since Zihe has gained fame by advocating for vomiting, the unknowledgeable rush to take shortcuts, which can lead to errors beyond description; one must truly understand Zhang Zhongjing’s intentions regarding vomiting to avoid inappropriate uses.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

<p>Phlegm and fluid, being of a yin nature, obstruct and suppress the yang. Using this yang medicine to transform energy and promote the yang is the correct method. The focus here is on cases of fullness and oppression in the chest and ribs, with accompanying dizziness. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that the pulse of the pericardium can cause disease related to fullness in the chest and ribs. Therefore, when phlegm and fluid accumulate in the pericardium, the resulting illness must manifest as such. Dizziness occurs when phlegm and fluid obstruct the yang in the chest, preventing the distribution of water essence upwards. Poria helps to treat phlegm and fluid, eliminate kidney evil, and promote the water pathways; cinnamon twig moves the yang qi, harmonizes the nutritive and defensive energies, and opens the meridians; white atractylodes addresses wind-related dizziness, dries phlegm and fluid, and relieves fullness; licorice, when used with poria, prevents excess fullness and promotes functional alleviation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Big and Small Qinglong Decoction</strong></p>
<p>In the case of excessive drinking, when water overflows to the surface, the ying and wei are both adversely affected. One must follow the methods used for cold damage that harm both the ying and wei, inducing sweating to disperse the water. When the ying and wei are harmonious and the meridians flow smoothly, the water in the limbs will also dissipate. Ultimately, the Big Qinglong ascends to the heavens, producing clouds and rain, while the Small Qinglong stirs the waves and rushes into the vast sea. Therefore, for the treatment of water retention, the Small Qinglong must be regarded as the foremost principle.</p>
<p><strong>On the Ten Jujube Decoction and Gansui and Banxia Decoction</strong></p>
<p>For cold damage, with fullness and pain in both flanks, Ten Jujube Decoction should be administered. For phlegm and fluid retention illnesses, although they are not directly comparable to cold damage, if the retained water causes pain in the flanks, it is similar. Moreover, if the pulse is deep and tight, the pathogenic factor will not leave unless it is urgently expelled, hence using Ten Jujube Decoction is not considered excessive. Any illness located in the flanks that requires purging should follow this example. As for the Gansui and Gancao Decoction for treating retained fluids, it is subtle and profound; only those deep in the sacred domain can master it. The <em>Neijing</em> only states to attack the retained fluid, and thus Zhong Jing elaborated on its implications to encompass its variations. For intangible pathogenic energy, if heat is concentrated in the stomach, one should use the Adjust Stomach and Purge Decoction to attack it; if heat is concentrated in the intestines, one should use the Big and Small Purge Decoction to attack it. For tangible fluids, if they are collected in the chest, use the Chest Trap Decoction to attack; if they are collected in the flanks, use the Ten Jujube Decoction to attack; if they are retained between the intestines and stomach, use the Gansui and Banxia Decoction to attack.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states that when a patient has a concealed pulse, they desire self-benefit, but such benefit leads to more discomfort. Even though there is a stubborn fullness in the heart area, this is due to the presence of retained fluids that need to be expelled. The formula &quot;Gansui Banxia Decoction&quot; is indicated for this condition. The pulse is obstructed by the retained fluids, which remain stagnant; thus, even though there is a desire for relief, it cannot be achieved. The persistent fullness in the heart area indicates that the fluids have reached the intestines, while their source is still in the stomach. Unless the root cause is addressed, the retained fluids cannot be eliminated, hence the creation of this formula. </p>
<p>Gansui and licorice are opposites and should be combined to effectively target the root of retention, allowing for their complete expulsion without preserving any medicinal properties. This aligns with the principle from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that emphasizes the importance of not discarding necessary elements. Additionally, white honey is added to avoid any adverse reactions. The inclusion of Banxia and Shaoyao is due to their relation to the transformation of wood into earth, solidifying the fullness. Banxia enhances the earth, and Shaoyao counters the wood—what is the underlying principle here? Later texts have often omitted licorice, leading to a decline in their efficacy and turning formulas into mere trivialities. This raises the question of what benefit such changes truly deliver.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Three Formulas: Mufangji Decoction, Denglizhidaozhao Decoction, and Fangji Jiao Mu Denglizhihuang Pill</strong></p>
<p>All three formulas treat fluid accumulation entering the diaphragm, differing in depth and order of treatment. The first formula primarily treats the lung, the second firmly addresses the lung, and the third simultaneously treats the lung qi transmitted to the organs. Fluid accumulation enters the diaphragm, pressing against the heart and lungs, and may cause kidney problems. The text states that the person experiences wheezing and fullness, has a firm sensation below the heart, a dark complexion, and a tight, deep pulse. After several days, if the physician administers vomiting or purging and the patient does not improve, the Mufangji Decoction is indicated. If the condition is due to deficiency, it will improve; if due to excess, it may relapse after three days. For those unhealed, remove gypsum and add Poria and Glauber&#39;s salt. This is because fluid accumulation obstructs the qi, leading to wheezing and fullness in the lungs, while obstructing the blood causes a firm sensation below the heart. The kidney qi responds upwards, resulting in a dark complexion; thus, the blood&#39;s dark color appears on the face. However, it is important to ease the treatment of the heart and kidneys and prioritize the treatment of the lung. If lung qi is flowing, the fluid does not reverse, and they will both be resolved.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mutual infiltration of flavors and temperatures, such as morus wood and toxic herbs, can dissipate residual fluid and resolve qi stagnation, primarily addressing lung-related wheezing and fullness. Gypsum, with its slightly cold, sweet, and pungent properties, governs counterflow of qi in the chest, clears the lungs, and settles wheezing. Ginseng, warming and sweet, is effective for alleviating wheezing, dissolving phlegm, and replenishing the heart and lungs&#39; deficiencies. Cinnamon twig is spicy and warm, promoting blood flow, unblocking qi, and harmonizing various medicines for immediate effect when taken in the qi level. </p>
<p>However, if the fluid is within the blood aspect and deeply connected to the lower energies, recurrence is inevitable. Therefore, it is necessary to remove gypsum, which addresses the qi aspect, and incorporate Glauber&#39;s salt to resolve phlegm accumulation and eliminate blood stagnation, combining it with poria to soften hardness below the heart and also tackle kidney evil. </p>
<p>The Da Zao Tang, by forcefully draining lung qi, also treats cases where fluids accumulate due to stagnation. The Fang Ji Jiao Mu Ting Li Da Huang Wan is indicated for abdominal fullness with dry mouth and tongue, as well as the presence of watery qi in the intestines, attributed to lung qi congestion leading to fluid retention below. To urgently open the waterways and relieve the trapped lung qi, this pill is used to approach the lower aspect of treatment, making it a pill form for effectiveness.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<p>The first formula treats phlegm-dampness with vomiting but no thirst. The phlegm dampness rises to the diaphragm, leading to vomiting; its force is most prominent when it ascends. However, if one vomits, thirst is normally expected, and if there is thirst, one can expect the phlegm-dampness to completely disperse. If there is no thirst, then some fluid remains, indicating that it hasn’t been entirely expelled. There is no need for additional treatment; simply using the acrid warmth of Banxia and the acrid dispersing qualities of fresh ginger will help urge out what remains, thus allowing any retained evils to dissipate.</p>
<p>The middle formula also treats sudden vomiting, but with more pronounced heaviness in the abdomen and water retention in the diaphragm causing dizziness and palpitations. Therefore, Poria is added to remove water and tranquilize the heart. </p>
<p>The final formula includes ginseng, bitter orange, and tangerine peel, which is particularly crucial.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the treatment of fluid retention (支饮) and associated symptoms as described in classical Chinese medicine. It details two different approaches to address the condition: </p>
<p>The first approach addresses the retention of fluids affecting the heart, which obstructs the upward and downward movements of Yang Qi, leading to symptoms such as dizziness and a feeling of heaviness. If one does not treat the dizziness directly but instead facilitates urination to expel the retained fluids, the Yang Qi can rise properly, and the associated wind and fire symptoms will subside. This is a common method practiced by Zhang Zhongjing.</p>
<p>The second approach pertains to the treatment of chest fullness caused by fluid retention. In this case, Zhang Zhongjing would use a specific formula to address the condition, which involves purging trapped heat and fluid from the body.</p>
<p>The text also references the Wuling San formula, indicating that if a thin person experiences palpitations and produces frothy saliva with dizziness, this is due to water retention and the Wuling San formula is indicated. The underlying principle is that a build-up of fluids in the body due to their inherent Yin qualities can lead to these symptoms, and it is not enough to treat the dizziness directly; one must disperse the accompanying Yin pathogenic factors for a cure. Thus, proper treatment will alleviate the condition.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

Those in the modern world who use Wu Ling San only understand it as a formula to regulate the distribution of food and water, not realizing its significance in balancing the interior and exterior, Yin and Yang. The text mentions drinking warm water and sweating as beneficial but fails to note these essential points, showing a profound lack of understanding! Moreover, regarding Xiao Qing Long Tang, people only recognize it as a light remedy for releasing the exterior and do not realize it is designed to facilitate the small water. The Xiao Long from the mountains and marshes grows its horns and rushes towards the dark sea amidst thunder and rain; it cannot simply ascend to the heavens.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Questions and Answers on Phlegm Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The person was told: The rules for treating phlegm do not appear in the prescription books. For a condition above, one would use formulas like Guati Powder or Zhihua Decoction; for the left side, Longhui Pill; for the right side, Gunphlegm Pill; and for those of weak constitution, Zhu Li Datan Pill. In cases of cold and stagnant conditions, Sanjian Decoction can be used. All these methods lack profound principles; how can one expect to master them readily, and can they be passed down on paper? I will now transmit this knowledge to the younger generation. </p>
<p>The essence is that when the five flavors enter the mouth, they are stored in the stomach, which serves as the sea of food and drink, and the central controller of the five organs and six bowels. When a person consumes too much food and drink, phlegm and saliva are produced. This occurs as phlegm saturates the meridians, following the healthy functioning of the spleen and its ability to circulate. The dynamics of this back and forth resemble the ebb and flow of ocean tides: when the energy of the spleen flows, the tide goes out; when it stops, the tide returns. Therefore, the method for treating stagnation involves taking warming, spicy substances to slightly invigorate and relieve the cold that has condensed. After this, one must stop further intervention, as allowing phlegm to become hot and move recklessly can lead to significant harm. </p>
<p>Not only can phlegm behave erratically when heated, but excessive heat in the spleen can also cause it to become overly active without rest, reminiscent of tides that flow out without returning. The consequences of such phlegm disorders can be grave indeed.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who have long consumed harsh and strong medicines also yearn for food in the dead of night. People do not understand the reason for this; instead, they celebrate the ability to eat without realizing the importance of preserving the spleen&#39;s function, allowing it to operate during the day and rest at night, which is necessary for balance. Furthermore, the phlegm in the human body flows from the stomach through the meridians; thus, the phlegm from the meridians must return to the stomach to rise up through the mouth and descend through the intestines. This can only happen when the spleen’s function is tranquil. Therefore, anyone with phlegm-related issues should not only eat early and at noon but should also rest and preserve the spleen&#39;s function to allow the phlegm in the meridians to return to the stomach, where it can properly ascend and descend, rather than dispersing from the spleen. Observe those with mild phlegm conditions who can comfortably sleep at night and the next morning can expel phlegm; contrast this with those with severe phlegm conditions who are dazed, unable to expel it due to lack of food and the spleen not being at rest, thus blocking the phlegm’s exit. Do those who love to use strong medicines realize this? Alas! Many in the world who enjoy spicy and heated treatments manage to eat at night; will they reconsider their words and reflect three times?<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The condition of phlegm and fluid is only mentioned in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as a case of accumulated fluid, and it never explicitly refers to phlegm as a disease. This indicates that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not place significant emphasis on the phlegm condition. Upon examining the term &quot;phlegm,&quot; though it originated from Zhongjing, it has been passed down through generations, and regardless of whether one discusses phlegm or not, people often mention &quot;phlegm-fire.&quot; Some say strange diseases are due to phlegm, while others claim phlegm is the source of numerous ailments, suggesting that the relationship with phlegm is not taken lightly. So why then does the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; overlook it? </p>
<p>One must understand that the occurrence of phlegm as a disease must have its causes. For example, if phlegm arises from wind or fire, treating the wind or fire will clear the phlegm on its own. If phlegm arises from deficiency or excess, addressing the deficiency or excess will also resolve the phlegm. I have never heard of treating phlegm alone to disperse wind and fire or to adjust deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is why phlegm must arise due to illness, and not the other way around—illness does not cause phlegm. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not mention phlegm, specifically because phlegm is not the root of the disease; it is merely a symptom. Today, practitioners worldwide focus solely on attacking phlegm, believing that this treats the disease, yet they do not understand what phlegm is or how it arises. This is akin to pointing at an arm to understand the shoulder or watering leaves to save the roots. Misrecognition of symptoms and underlying causes leads to losing the true perspective; seeking to cure the disease becomes difficult.</p>
<p>Although phlegm and liquid are said to belong to the same category, they are indeed different. Liquid pertains to water and fluids; any vomiting of clear water, abdominal distension, sour belching, or sounds of wetness are all symptoms of stagnant food and fluids that do not circulate—this is referred to as liquid. Phlegm, however, differs from liquid; liquid is clear, while phlegm is thick and turbid. Liquid merely stagnates in the intestines and stomach, while phlegm can appear in any part of the body.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When food and drink do not transform and instead become phlegm, this illness is entirely due to the spleen and stomach. Phlegm arises from various organs&#39; injuries, and thus, in treating this, one must understand how to discern the problem, paying close attention to its root. </p>
<p>Phlegm is essentially the body&#39;s fluids, transformed from food and drink. This phlegm is a transformed substance, not something that does not transform. When transformation occurs properly, the body is strong, and nourishment flows abundantly, with phlegm and mucus originating from blood and qi. However, when transformation goes awry, the organs suffer, fluids become disrupted, and blood and qi turn into phlegm and mucus. This is akin to thieves arising in a chaotic world; who among them does not wish for peace? Yet, the rise of thieves is surely due to the decline of the state, and the emergence of phlegm and mucus must occur due to the decay of vital energy. </p>
<p>I once heard Mr. Li Zhai say: if blood and qi are both flourishing, how could there be phlegm? In my early years, I somewhat doubted this statement, thinking, is there truly no real phlegm?

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can one see this? The transformation of phlegm and saliva fundamentally arises from food and water. If the spleen is strong and the stomach healthy, just like in youth, then it transforms food into blood and qi as it is consumed, leaving no room for phlegm to remain. However, if transformation is not complete, and one or two parts are left over, then those become phlegm; if three or four parts linger, then those are phlegm too; and if seven or eight remain, one will see the daily decline of blood and qi, while phlegm increases daily. The reason for this is that the original qi cannot function effectively, and as deficiency increases, phlegm becomes more abundant. Thus, the words of Li Zhai suggest a perspective beyond the ordinary. Currently, those who treat phlegm always say it is the cause of suffering and that one must attack it to eliminate it. They do not realize that when the righteous qi is stagnant and phlegm accumulates due to deficiency, even with vigorous efforts to attack it, not only can phlegm not be expelled, but the deficiency may worsen. Some may experience sudden cessation of phlegm due to aggressive treatment, only to find that it becomes more severe later on—this is a miscalculation in treatment. Few know that the phlegm that can be attacked is rarer, while the phlegm that cannot be attacked is more common; hence, those treating phlegm must first assess the underlying deficiency or excess.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

By observing the manifestations and the signs of disease, anything that is characterized by excess is excess phlegm. What is excess phlegm? It means that the original qi is still strong. In this case, it is appropriate to disperse and eliminate it, as it is permissible to remove the phlegm. What does it mean to be untreatable? This refers to cases where the body is slender and weak, or where one has reached middle age and is declining; such conditions indicate deficient phlegm.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some are plagued by various illnesses, some by exhaustion, and some by worries, drink, and indulgence, leading to fatigue and ailments that are not due to wind or sudden seizures but rather to phlegm due to deficiency. Others may present with thin and rapid pulses, and without any pathogenic factors in the organs, exhibiting symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and hoarseness. However, upon observing their physical condition and the nature of their symptoms, if there is no excess, it is all phlegm due to deficiency. What is phlegm due to deficiency? It refers to the depletion of one&#39;s vital energy. In this case, one should only proceed with nourishment and reinforcement; any attempt to attack it will lead to danger. Moreover, in the case of phlegm due to excess, it is originally not abundant, it arises suddenly, disperses quickly, and the illness is easy to treat. Why is that? Because the illness is not deep-rooted. In contrast, phlegm due to deficiency is often abundant; it accumulates gradually, disperses slowly, and is difficult to treat. Why is that? Because the illness has persisted for a long time. Therefore, phlegm due to excess is not a great concern, while phlegm due to deficiency is the most fearsome. In summary, the method to treat phlegm is straightforward: the key is to strengthen the vital energy daily, and then the phlegm will gradually decrease. Even if there is a slight phlegm, it will not cause harm, and it will also support the stomach’s energy. Conversely, if the vital energy declines daily, then all fluids from food and drink will essentially turn into phlegm.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As one goes, one lives; if there are those who can attack it to the end, while also protecting the original vital energy unharmed, I do not believe it is possible. Therefore, those skilled in treating phlegm are only able to prevent its generation, which is the true art of mending heaven. Hence, regarding treatment of this condition, one cannot discern its reality or falsehood, and wishes to attack it indiscriminately, as Wang Yinjun discussed, claiming that all internal and external ailments arise from phlegm, applying remedies like the rolling phlegm pill without knowing the future harm that may ensue. </p>
<p>While diseases of the five organs can indeed produce phlegm, they all derive from the spleen and kidneys. The kidneys govern dampness; when dampness moves, it becomes phlegm. The kidneys also govern water; when water overflows, it too becomes phlegm. Hence, the transformation of phlegm does not occur without the spleen, and the essence of phlegm always lies in the kidneys. Therefore, every phlegm condition, whether one aspect or the other, must involve these two organs. However, phlegm from the spleen can be either deficient or excessive. If there is excessive stagnation of dampness, it is due to the spleen being full; if the earth is weak and cannot control water, it results from the spleen being deficient. Conversely, phlegm arising from the kidneys is always a matter of deficiency.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of fire cannot generate earth; that is, fire does not control water, and yang cannot overcome yin, which results in water invading the spleen; this indicates a deficiency of fire within yin. Conversely, if fire is strong and scorches metal, essence cannot reside properly, and fluids dry up, leading to mutual destruction between metal and water; this indicates a deficiency of water within yin. This distinction between the deficiency and surplus of the spleen and kidneys must be clarified. </p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding what ancient people referred to as damp phlegm, stagnant phlegm, cold phlegm, and heat phlegm, despite their differing locations—whether up or down, cold or hot—each has its own characteristics; however, their origins of transformation must also involve these two organs. For instance, cold phlegm and damp phlegm fundamentally stem from spleen issues, yet does the generation of cold dampness not also involve the kidneys? Wind from wood stagnation originates from the liver&#39;s phlegm, but when wood overpowers earth, can it not also relate to the spleen? When fire is strong and attacks metal, phlegm resides in the lungs, and when fire pathogenic heat rises, can it not impact both the upper and lower jiao? Therefore, anyone wishing to treat phlegm without understanding its source is merely guessing.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The phlegm of the spleen and stomach can be either due to deficiency or excess. When the dampness of the spleen soil is excessive, or when there is overindulgence in food and drink, and there are no deficiency symptoms that lead to phlegm, this is a primary condition of the spleen. Simply removing the dampness will clear the phlegm, and the primary treatment should be Er Chen Decoction, or alternatives such as Liu An Decoction, Tangerine Peel and Pinellia Decoction, Ping Wei San, Run Xia Wan, and Gun Tan Wan, among others. If phlegm arises from cold in the stomach along with bloating, He Wei Er Chen Decoction should be used; if accompanied by vomiting and pain, Shen Xiang San is appropriate; if caused by food, one should add malt, spirit-activated barley, hawthorn, and bitter orange. However, if the spleen and stomach are not deficient, then even if phlegm and fluid arise, it is likely only slight retention, thus not very harmful. Only in cases where the spleen is deficient and food cannot be digested, leading to phlegm, can the variations be many. The solution lies in regulating the spleen and stomach to strengthen their qi, which will eliminate the problems of food stagnation, making the phlegm and fluids part of the blood and qi.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the spleen qi is slightly deficient and unable to control dampness, or unable to transform and thus produces phlegm, the symptoms will be reduced appetite and fatigue, possibly accompanied by feelings of fullness or oppression. The appropriate treatments are six gentlemen decoction or five-flavored pilose antler powder, with Jinshui Liu Jun decoction also being excellent. If there is slight deficiency combined with cold, use Ling Zhu Er Chen decoction for treatment. If the spleen qi is greatly deficient, or if there is accompanying stomach cold leading to nausea and excessive phlegm, one should use six flavors of medicinal herbs decoction, warming the stomach drink, or regulating middle decoction as treatments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, overexertion can damage the spleen, and extreme fatigue can harm the liver and kidneys. With spleen qi damage, intake may decrease or nausea may be experienced; with liver and kidney damage, there may be misdirection of fluids or phlegm rising from below the navel. This indicates injury to both the spleen and kidney, a condition related to the root of life and mother of the earth. While the Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill is the standard treatment, the Yin regulating decoction is even more effective. White atractylodes and dried tangerine peel may also be added.</p>
<p>Phlegm originating from the kidney channel occurs when fluid becomes phlegm, which is mostly a deficiency syndrome.

It is advisable to use formulations such as Zuo Gui Wan, You Gui Wan, Liu Wei Wan, and Ba Wei Wan, adjusting for cold and heat as necessary.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Phlegm caused by wind-cold arises from external pathogens affecting the skin and hair, invading the lungs, leading to unclear lung qi and subsequently the production of phlegm. This is a type of cold damage; if treated with pungent and dispersing methods, the phlegm can resolve on its own. It is advisable to use formulas like Liu&#39;an Decoction or Erchen Decoction, and for more severe cases, Xiao Qinglong Decoction or similar remedies. If there is an external invasion of wind-cold combined with internal fire, one may also use Huangqin. In cases where blood and qi are both deficient, one should not solely rely on depleting treatments but should use Jinshui Liujun Decoction as the main remedy. If cold damage is accompanied by wind and symptoms like fever, cough, and phlegm, then Chai Chen Decoction should be used, or Jinshui Liujun Decoction with added Chaihu may also be appropriate.</p>
<p>Phlegm due to stroke is not an external influence but is caused by spleen and kidney deficiency. The methods for treating phlegm are detailed elsewhere and should be examined in conjunction with this. </p>
<p>When treating phlegm, one must differentiate between urgent and mild cases. In cases that are not related to wind but have phlegm obstructing and filling the upper burner, where medicine and food cannot be ingested, it is essential to first treat the phlegm to open the clearing pathway. If the phlegm is severe, inducing vomiting is the most effective method. If the phlegm is not so severe and food and drink can be taken, treatment should focus gently on addressing the root cause without rashly attacking, preferably using Liu&#39;an Decoction, Erchen Decoction, Runxia Pills, or Chenpi Banxia Decoction for regulation.

If mixed symptoms have worsened, and there is a gurgling phlegmatic sound in the throat that worsens with breathing, this is a critical situation that cannot be treated. </p>
<p>To treat phlegm, one must address the root cause, thus phlegm can be eliminated. If one only focuses on treating the phlegm itself, such a misunderstanding can lead to serious errors. All phlegm caused by excessive heat should first be addressed by treating the heat; phlegm resulting from cold should prioritize warming the center. Phlegm from wind should be dispelled, and spicy warming agents are essential. Phlegm due to dampness should be dried out; simply promoting urination will not resolve it. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of spleen deficiency that cannot control dampness, or kidney deficiency that cannot restrain water, both can lead to phlegm, which belongs to the category of cold phlegm. This phlegm may be caused by the spleen&#39;s yin drying out and transforming into a glue-like substance, or from the deterioration of metal and water leading to phlegm originating from blood, which is associated with heat phlegm. Generally, these two conditions account for the vast majority of phlegm syndromes, particularly those of phlegm that cannot be easily resolved due to deficiency. Furthermore, if there is excessive use of harsh and drastic treatments that exacerbate phlegm, it also indicates damage to the spleen and kidneys, highlighting the rarity of successful treatments that do not address the root cause.</p>
<p>Many schools of thought on treating phlegm tend to focus on superficial symptoms; while such methods cannot be completely dismissed, they should also not be the sole approach. The detailed treatment methods are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>For phlegm caused by exterior conditions, induce sweating; for interior conditions, use purgation; for phlegm combined with dampness, use diuretics. </li>
<li>If phlegm is lodged in the diaphragm, expectoration is essential; purgation alone will not suffice. </li>
<li>For thick, turbid phlegm, expectoration is mandatory.</li>
<li>Phlegm in the meridians can only be resolved through expectoration, which has the additional meaning of dispersing.</li>
<li>Phlegm located in the intestines and stomach can be eliminated through purgation. </li>
<li>Phlegm in the limbs can only be accessed through bamboo juice.</li>
<li>Phlegm beneath the ribs can only be expelled using white mustard seeds.</li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Family Tradition of Vomiting Method</strong></p>
<p>In his youth, the late Duke Shoufeng was well known for his drinking. Upon reaching his forties, he developed a drunkenness sickness, leading to the illness of phlegm and fluid retention. He frequently experienced sour vomiting and abdominal distention, with his appetite diminishing day by day. Symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, anxiety, and intermittent fevers followed in succession. Despite trying numerous remedies for phlegm, none had any effect. Inspired by the remarkable vomiting method of Zhang Zihe, he decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Initially, he used Duxing San, tea mixtures, and juices like leek. After one vomit, there was slight improvement; after another, more noticeable effects. From then on, he used it repeatedly. Although the phlegm gradually receded, his vitality did not recover. After more than a year, he felt gradually more skilled and suddenly understood the principle behind it, thus deciding to use no medicine at all. After eating breakfast, he would slowly gulp air, leading to throat movements that prompted immediate clearing of saliva. After a few more gulps, the thicker phlegm would follow.</p>
<p>From then on, whenever he encountered any ailments, regardless of whether they were superficial or deep, he would never take medicine. Instead, he used the vomiting method, which would effectively clear the issue by the same day. After reaching his sixties, he would perform it once a month or every half month without hesitation. He remained untroubled by fatigue, and his gray hair contrasted with a youthful complexion, growing increasingly vigorous each day.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At this time, the guest was young and gradually gaining knowledge. Concerned that his approach might cause harm by inducing vomiting, he subtly advised: &quot;Vomiting originates from phlegm, but can it be that all diseases can be treated by vomiting? Moreover, vomiting harms the vital energy, which is well understood; especially in declining years, can one not be cautious?&quot; The late sovereign replied: &quot;Vomiting is known to treat phlegm, that much is true; but do you know that it can also treat numerous diseases? Vomiting can harm the energy, you understand that; but do you also understand that it can generate energy? I shall elaborate for you. Among the ancient sages, there is no method better than the three techniques of Zihe and the reversed warehouse of Dankai. However, the method of reversed warehouse is difficult to practice, and few dare to use it. Only Zihe&#39;s techniques are commonly employed, yielding quick and abundant results. Now, speaking from my own methods, there are differences.&quot;<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of &quot;he&quot; involves inducing vomiting through medicine, which must be bitter and harsh; thus, the vomiting is forceful, and this is beyond my control, leading to inevitable harm. My own approach to vomiting does not use medicine; rather, phlegm follows the flow of qi, and qi arrives due to phlegm, allowing for a gradual response that can be beneficial and without harm. The method of &quot;he&quot; is applied in urgent situations, targeting the excess of phlegm. My method is intended for a gentler approach, capable of treating various deficiencies and a hundred diseases. The causes of a hundred diseases are inherently diverse, so why is vomiting appropriate for all? When phlegm and saliva are excessive and block the stomach and intestines, making the pathway clear impossible, one must induce vomiting. When there is an accumulation causing pain that is difficult to disperse, one must induce vomiting. When the phlegm is thickened and turbid, not easily resolved by medicine, one must induce vomiting. When phlegm resides in the meridians, membranes, and other difficult-to-identify locations, being deeply hidden and stored far away from medicinal reach, one must induce vomiting.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is all easily understood by people. Moreover, if one is affected by cold winds, vomiting can disperse it; if injury is caused by food and drink, vomiting can clear it; if there is stagnation due to heat, vomiting can release it; if the heat evil is severe, vomiting can mobilize the yang energy; if various evils are descending, vomiting has the function of rising; if evils are accumulating, vomiting has the power to dissolve them. Furthermore, all diseases in humans are fundamentally due to an obstruction in the flow of vital energy. Vomiting can facilitate the movement of this energy; when energy flows, nothing remains unaddressed, and thus there are no diseases. Therefore, for any strange and hard-to-treat illness, when physicians exhaust all their skills without success, they must employ the method of vomiting to reveal miraculous results, which is something not well-known to people. </p>
<p>Additionally, as for the concept of generating energy, not only do people not understand it, but they may also outright disbelieve it. I, through personal practice and experience, have begun to perceive its subtlety. The workings of heaven and earth, which never cease, fundamentally revolve around the rise and fall of two forms of energy. Rising is rooted in yang, the way of growth; descending is rooted in yin, the way of decline. My use of energy is based on this rising and uplifting principle. It can be quick or slow, naturally incorporating the life force; without harm or violence, it encompasses the miraculous effects of non-medicinal means. Therefore, after vomiting, the spirit and energy are bound to be enhanced, as you have observed. The path of yang must surely flourish; this is what I usually verify. If it were not for vomiting being able to generate energy, could it be so? Taoists use the Governing Vessel, while I employ the Conception Vessel; the methods used are different, but they lead to the same outcome. This not only counters illness but also extends life.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I say this is not erroneous, you should fully understand it! Those who follow this instruction and practice it regularly will find it effective, though it may not reach the divine subtlety of the late Emperor. Since the time of Xuanchi, only you, Zi He, have adeptly employed the method of expelling. Comparatively, if one were to measure with the Emperor&#39;s techniques, the differences in difficulty and efficacy are like the contrast between heaven and earth. The one said to be unparalleled since ancient times certainly cannot be Zi He. If the wise see the same, they will certainly follow in your footsteps, and those to come should not be few. However, I fear that in a hundred generations, this heart and the marvelous way may fade, which is why I have detailed and recorded these teachings, providing a complete account of the method below:</p>
<p>The late Emperor&#39;s method of expelling was practiced at the time of the fifth watch, when waking from sleep, lying on one&#39;s back, using belching to guide the breath. If the breath is insufficient, one swallows to belch, lifting the breath as one swallows, and phlegm will inevitably follow the breath. Even the deepest phlegm can be expelled, but the last to exit may have an appearance, color, and odor that is exceedingly vile and cannot be put into words. Therefore, after expelling, one may find their lips swollen and throat sore, but this can be relieved with a few sips of cool water. After expulsion, one should avoid all five flavors for breakfast, only consuming one or two bowls of plain porridge to nourish the clear energies within the stomach. After a period of forty days, one should absolutely avoid alcohol. Those who practiced this expelling method for over forty years, thus growing stronger with age, lived to their eighties and could still climb mountains and transcribe ancient books under the lamp. Later, without illness, one suddenly smiled and began fasting, reaching the age of eighty-two.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Root of Treating Phlegm</p>
<p>Excess phlegm in a person arises from a deficiency in the internal system. Phlegm is essentially water, with its foundation in the kidneys and its manifestation in the spleen. In the kidneys, it is due to water not returning to its origin, causing it to become phlegm. In the spleen, it occurs when food and drink are not transformed, as the earth does not control the water. Observing robust individuals who indulge in excess drinking and eating, one finds that their consumption is swiftly transformed, and they do not manifest phlegm. It is only those who cannot eat that tend to produce phlegm, because their spleen is deficient and cannot metabolize food, and thus food becomes phlegm. Therefore, in cases of deficiency and exhaustion, there is bound to be an increase in phlegm, and in critical illnesses, phlegm becomes even more severe, primarily because the spleen&#39;s energy becomes increasingly deficient, resulting in an inability to transform it, leading all liquids to turn into phlegm. Thus, is the relationship between disease and phlegm such that disease comes from phlegm or phlegm from disease? Is it not clear that phlegm must arise from deficiency? It can be seen that there are very few cases of actual phlegm, and similarly few opportunities to address phlegm. Therefore, in treating phlegm, one must warm the spleen and strengthen the kidneys to address the root of phlegm, ensuring that the foundation gradually becomes more robust, leading to the natural resolution of phlegm without needing treatment.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Phlegm and the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>I have often heard it said in common discourse: phlegm pervades the whole body, causing ailments that are hard to diagnose. Conditions such as paralysis, stroke, and hemiplegia are all due to phlegm stagnating. If this is the case, then phlegm is indeed an evil influence; if phlegm is not eliminated, how can the illness possibly recover? I say: do you know the origin of phlegm? </p>
<p>The phlegm in the meridians arises from the transformation of bodily fluids and blood. When the Wei and Ying energies are harmonized, the fluids flow properly and blood circulates freely, then what phlegm could exist? It is only when the original Yang is depleted and the Spirit&#39;s mechanism is exhausted that the water becomes devoid of vitality, leading to thickened fluids and deteriorated blood, which then transforms into phlegm. This is indeed phlegm, it is truly essence and blood. How can there be a notion of phlegm separate from essence and blood? </p>
<p>If one asserts that phlegm resides in the meridians and cannot be expelled without attacking it directly, then one must also eliminate essence and blood alongside it, which might be acceptable. Otherwise, how can one solely target phlegm while essence and blood remain untouched? If the bodily fluids and blood are further harmed, the original vital energy will become increasingly depleted, and anything removed will lead to further transformation of phlegm; thus, those who treat phlegm cannot fully succeed, and what they do manage to expel is merely the original energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are cases where phlegm is nonexistent at the root, yet misguided efforts identify something as phlegm, leading to mistaken treatment—how profoundly ignorant this is! Therefore, any use of phlegm remedies such as rolling phlegm pills or wind-searching and qi-regulating pills must ensure that the original energy remains unharmed, and only in situations of occasional stagnation or slight unclarity of phlegm can these remedies be temporarily employed; it cannot be said that they are ineffective. If the original energy is affected and one only knows to address the symptoms, there has never been an instance where daily treatment did not lead to daily decline.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Non-Wind Phlegm Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>When treating phlegm, if it is not a case of initial wind disease and the phlegm qi is not severe, one must not hastily assume it is phlegm and recklessly use phlegm-dispelling medicines; this is a great caution. If phlegm and saliva are obstructively excessive, filling the chest and diaphragm to the point that neither soup nor liquid can enter, then one must first open the phlegm to clear the pathway for medicines and food. The most effective method to open phlegm is through vomiting, as in the ancient formulas like Du Sheng San, Cha Diao San, and Xi Yan San, all of which are remedies for inducing vomiting. However, there is concern that if the vital energy is greatly deficient, it may not withstand such harsh treatments; thus, it would be more prudent to use new vomiting methods or utilize medicines like Niu Huang Wan or Bao Long Wan, ensuring that the throat and qi are unobstructed enough to allow for ingestion of soup and drink. One must not entirely attack the phlegm to the point of jeopardizing health, which requires utmost caution. Therefore, the method of treating phlegm must also assess whether it can be attacked or not before proceeding; this will avoid errors. If the eyes are glaring and the teeth are clenched, the limbs are rigid, and the face is flushed strong and vigorous, even if there is a clouded mind, it is still treatable. First, use a coarse utensil to pry open the mouth, then with a solid writing rod, keep the jaws steady, and slowly administer a light ginger and salt soup. Next, insert two fingers into the throat, slowly guiding them to induce vomiting. If the fingers cannot reach, a goose feather dipped in soup can substitute for probing to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After several attempts, if one can expel the phlegm and feel relief, one is bound to gradually awaken, and then it is appropriate to consider administering medicine. This is the method for treating phlegm obstruction. However, if the signs of death are already present and there is a gurgling sound of phlegm in the throat, expelling it will be of no benefit and there is no need to do so. If the phlegm and qi are exceedingly strong and cannot be expelled, it is also a sign that no treatment is required. Additionally, for those whose constitution is severely weak, one should avoid means of expulsion, as they should not be attacked in this manner. If the physical symptoms are established but the phlegm and qi are not severe, one should absolutely not treat the phlegm. Instead, one should focus on regulating qi and blood to achieve gradual recovery. If phlegm and fluids are not yet cleared, the treatment for phlegm should distinguish between deficiency and excess. If qi is not significantly deficient, and phlegm is produced from either cold or heat, one should use Liu&#39;an Decoction or Erchen Decoction. If fire is the cause of phlegm, Qingge Drink, Bamboo Juice, or children&#39;s urine should be used. With severe fire, the Chouxin Drink is appropriate. For those with spleen deficiency and a tendency to vomit with excessive phlegm, Liu Junzi Decoction or Wumei Yigong Powder should be considered. If there is insufficient yin energy, with abundant phlegm and dryness accompanied by thirst, Jinshui Liu Jun Decoction is recommended. For yin deficiency leading to water overflowing as phlegm, one can take Liuwei Wan or Bawei Wan in appropriate doses, or prepare them as soups. If phlegm is produced due to the spleen and kidneys being deficient, cold, and unable to transform, one need not treat both phlegm and qi, but should rather focus on warming and strengthening the roots. If there is a deficiency of middle qi, Lichong Decoction or Wengwei Drink is suitable. For those with insufficient yin, the treatment should prioritize decoctions for nourishing yin.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber - Chen Tuduo (Qing Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phlegm Disease</strong></p>
<p>The treatment of phlegm involves the obstruction of phlegm between the throat and the windpipe. Although it seems trivial, it can lead to serious health issues, which is why the ancients established a separate approach for its treatment. However, the methods created focus only on the symptoms of phlegm and do not address its root cause. Therefore, the Erchen Decoction was established to treat both recent and chronic illnesses, yet it proves ineffective. I now propose three formulations: one for newly occurring phlegm, one for phlegm in existing illnesses, and one for phlegm in long-standing conditions. Although phlegm diseases are numerous, they do not transcend our scope of treatment. For early onset, the symptoms of wind-cold, cough, and phlegm are present. Use equal parts of Banxia, Chenpi, Tianhuafen, Fuling, Gancao, and Suzi, each weighing ten grams, and decoct in water for consumption. After two doses, the phlegm will dissipate; this formula eliminates phlegm from the upper jiao. The phlegm in the upper jiao originates from the stomach rather than the lungs. By removing the phlegm from the stomach, the lung&#39;s metal energy is restored, preventing any rise of fire. For phlegm in existing diseases, it resides in the middle jiao, and one must observe its color, distinguishing between white and yellow distinctly. Yellow indicates the fire has begun to recede, while white shows the fire is still rampant.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For excessive heat, it is appropriate to use cool and cold substances; when the heat is receding, it is advisable to add herbs that dispel it. I now prescribe a formula that can treat both conditions: three qian of white atractylodes, three qian of white mustard seed, five qian of polyporus, one qian each of dried tangerine peel and licorice, one qian of gardenia for phlegm, and five fen of bitter orange, to be decocted in water and taken. This formula is a remedy to strengthen the spleen, not specifically for dispelling phlegm. However, the accumulation of phlegm is often due to dampness in the spleen. By strengthening the spleen, the dampness will descend, and if the dampness does not remain in the spleen, where will it rise from? Moreover, with the addition of a remarkable remedy for dispelling phlegm, can the phlegm remain restless and persist? As for phlegm from prolonged illness, one must not equate it with phlegm due to spleen dampness. Prolonged illness invariably leads to depletion of kidney water; if the kidney water does not rise to become phlegm, then the fire in the kidney boiling can also manifest as phlegm. Thus, for phlegm from chronic illness, one should tonify the kidneys to dispel it. The formula includes five qian each of cooked rehmannia, coix seed, and foxnut, three qian each of cornelian cherry, ophiopogon, polyporus, and Chinese yam, one qian each of northern five-flavor fruit and plantago seeds, and three fen of alpinia galanga, decocted in water and taken. This remedy is particularly effective for phlegm caused by kidney water rising. If the phlegm is due to boiling fire, add one qian of cinnamon.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This formula is remarkable for its ability to nourish the kidneys while also eliminating dampness and transforming phlegm. When water enters the kidney palace, it is transformed into true essence; how can it rise and become phlegm? This is a method for treating phlegm in the lower jiao. With these three formulas, we can adjust the dosage according to the symptoms and manage phlegm without further issues. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are two other formulas for treating longstanding phlegm that has become chronic. The formula includes Chaihu and licorice, each one qian; Baijiezi and Yiyiren, each five qian; Fuling and Baishao, each three qian; Chenpi three fen; Danpi two qian; and Tianhuafen eight fen, to be prepared as a decoction. This formula is special because it uses Baijiezi as the sovereign, with Yiyiren and Baishao as ministers, and Chaihu and Huafen as assistants, ensuring that the chronic phlegm has nowhere to hide and is gradually digested. This formula can be taken in eight doses, and it eliminates all chronic phlegm, named Xiaozhuo San.</p>
<p>Another formula is for stubborn phlegm. If it forms lumps and obstructs the throat, it is called stubborn phlegm; if it remains in the chest and does not transform, it is called chronic phlegm. The formula includes Ziwanyuan two qian; Banxia, Beimu, Fuling, Jiegeng, Baizhu, and Shenchu, each three qian; as well as BaiFan and licorice, each one qian, to be prepared as a decoction.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This prescription is remarkable for using both Fritillaria and Pinellia together; one is dry and the other moist, preventing phlegm from hiding anywhere. Additionally, with the use of white alum to dissolve lumps, and Platycodon and Aster to eliminate邪, Licorice harmonizes the center. Is there anything that will not work like this?</p>
<p>For those suffering from phlegm diseases that do not heal after a long time, take a pig&#39;s lung, five qian of radish seeds, and one tael of white mustard seeds, all ground into a powder. Mix them well and steam in a rice pot until cooked. Eating one portion after a meal will cure you. This method treats phlegm in the upper jiao, especially when decoctions are ineffective, and it is indeed miraculous. It clears out the phlegm that has long resided in the lungs, making it an excellent treatment.</p>
<p>For middle phlegm, the prescription includes three qian each of Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Poria, one qian each of Aconite and Tian Nanxing, and two qian of Pinellia; boil in water to take as a decoction. It will cure immediately upon reaching the throat. Phlegm arises due to the deficiency of qi, and qi deficiency arises from the coldness of the organs. Thus, in the prescription, Ginseng and Atractylodes are used to replenish the vital qi, while Pinellia, Tian Nanxing, and Poria are used to expel phlegm, and Aconite warms the center, which leads to quieting the phlegm sound and clearing the phlegm qi.</p>
<p>If the phlegm enters the upper jiao, causing stagnant lumps that neither rise nor fall, blocking the chest, resulting in shortness of breath, the urge to vomit without success, or the inability to cough it up, the method should then employ Yin Yang water to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One may use the juice of melon seeds or the herb lungs of wild goose to induce vomiting, but this should only be done if one has phlegm and qi stuck in the chest causing pain. Otherwise, it is absolutely forbidden. The vital energy of a person cannot be harmed; vomiting even once will lead to a cycle of disturbance in the five organs and will definitely shorten life. Therefore, one must first inquire whether the person has chest pain, whether there is a blockage in the qi, whether there is an obstruction in the throat, and whether the phlegm that is expelled is yellow. Only when these conditions are present should one consider using the aforementioned remedy to induce vomiting.</p>
<p>Vomiting should not be taken lightly. If one is unaware of the contraindications and rashly induces vomiting, it will definitely disturb the five organs. One must observe whether the expelled phlegm has a shiny appearance against the wall, akin to the shine of snail saliva, which indicates that it is safe to vomit. All else should be avoided. However, if it is shiny, it does not matter whether the phlegm is located in the upper, middle, or lower parts. This shiny color must wait until the phlegm is dried and identified clearly; it cannot be assumed to be shiny just because it is wet.</p>
<p>When there is both central qi and phlegm, though different in nature, they are essentially both rooted in the deficiency of qi. When qi is deficient, phlegm is naturally abundant; when phlegm is abundant, it inevitably consumes qi, thus they are divided yet fundamentally connected.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Take one tael of ginseng, three qian each of pinellia, poria, and south bitter herb, one qian each of aconite and licorice, and decoct in water to be taken. This will remedy the symptoms of central qi and phlegm. Ginseng is originally a divine agent for the qi, and it is also a marvelous medicine for resolving phlegm. Pinellia and south bitter herb, while being superior in expelling phlegm, also support the righteous qi. Aconite and licorice, one nourishing and one courageous, assist each other to become formidable allies. Used among these three flavors, strengthening the righteous will certainly remove the evil, and resolving phlegm will inevitably benefit the qi. There is a division and combination without an apparent form, an extraordinary uniqueness and marvelous transformation that must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>The treatment of qi is important, as there are many qi disorders; I will discuss the major ones, such as qi counterflow and phlegm obstruction. The obstruction of phlegm is not due to phlegm itself but to the stagnation of qi. If one only addresses phlegm without benefiting the qi, I have not seen phlegm dissipate and the illness alleviate. The formula includes two qian of white atractylodes, three qian of poria, and one qian each of ginseng, aged tangerine peel, trichosanthes root, white mustard seed, szechuan pepper, and perilla seed, along with three lumps of cardamom, decocted in water to be taken. The brilliance of this formula lies in treating phlegm while first regulating the qi. When the qi is smooth, the phlegm becomes active; when the qi flows freely, the moisture circulates, and phlegm will not even arise. This is the appropriate approach to treating qi, and one can immediately gain insight into methods for addressing stagnant qi through a single formula.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For the condition of qi deficiency with excessive phlegm, the phlegm is fundamentally due to dampness. In treating phlegm, one must not merely eliminate the dampness but should first supplement qi, and then assist with phlegm-resolving ingredients. The formula consists of three qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and poria, five qian of coix, one qian each of shenqu, dried tangerine peel, and licorice, all decocted in water. Although this formula includes pinellia and dried tangerine peel to resolve phlegm, without sufficient ginseng, the phlegm will not dissipate; ginseng aids qi, and ingredients like coix and poria can strengthen the spleen to eliminate dampness. Once the dampness is removed, phlegm will naturally resolve; this is a method for treating qi deficiency.</p>
<p>For cases of qi deficiency with cold phlegm, simply add three qian of cinnamon and half a qian of dried ginger to the previous formula. For cases of qi deficiency with heat phlegm, one should not use the previous formulation but instead employ three qian each of lianhua, white peony, and angelica; one qian each of tianhuafen, licorice, dried tangerine peel, and white mustard seed; and two qian of poria, along with three fen of shenqu, all decocted in water. The efficacy of this formulation lies in its ability to avoid excessive dryness while also supplementing qi; it moistens and transforms phlegm, so when phlegm is expelled, qi will naturally become sufficient as well. With these two formulations, treating qi deficiency will be no challenge.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is a rise of kidney water leading to excessive phlegm, one should use the Six-Flavor Decoction with the additions of aconite and cinnamon, prepared as a decoction and consumed in several bowls for recovery. In cases of deficiency of kidney water and kidney fire, even if there are signs of heat in the upper jiao, the tongue remains slippery and not dry, unlike the dryness associated with the extreme heat in yang conditions. </p>
<p>Fat individuals tend to have phlegm, which results from qi deficiency; when qi is deficient, it cannot move, causing phlegm to accumulate. Therefore, treating phlegm must also involve tonifying qi while simultaneously eliminating the phlegm. However, when tonifying qi, one must not solely focus on strengthening the spleen and stomach; it should also include augmenting the fire of the Mingmen (Gate of Vitality). Fire generates earth, and earth produces qi; when qi is ample, phlegm will naturally dissipate. Not treating phlegm directly is part of treating phlegm. </p>
<p>The prescription includes three taels each of ginseng, eucommia bark, and white mustard seed; five taels each of white atractylodes, coix seed, and fox nut; eight taels of cooked rehmannia; four taels of shan yue; two taels each of cinnamon and poria; five qian of cardamom; and one tael each of Alpinia fruit and dried tangerine peel, all ground into powder and mixed with honey to form pills, taken with five qian of boiling water each day. </p>
<p>The effectiveness of this formula lies in cinnamon, which tonifies the fire of the Mingmen and heart protector. When the fire in the heart protector is sufficient, it can stimulate appetite and eliminate phlegm; when the fire of the Mingmen is strong, it can invigorate the spleen and eliminate dampness. Moreover, the ingredients in this formula are primarily tonifying to the heart and kidneys, and cinnamon among these tonifying herbs promotes harmony between heaven and earth. With the water returning to the channels, where would phlegm accumulate? This is the method for treating fat individuals.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Lao Tan Pill</p>
<p>Clears dryness and alleviates stagnation, lowers heat and resolves phlegm. It treats chronic phlegm that has thickened into clumps, stagnating in the throat, obstructing the clarity of lung qi, leading to difficulty in expectoration, often caused by fiery evils rising and blocking the heart and lungs. It is advisable to alleviate stagnation, lower heat, and resolve phlegm.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tianmen Dong</li>
<li>Huangqin, stir-fried in wine</li>
<li>Hai Fen, ground separately</li>
<li>(Caoshe) Lou Ren, ground separately</li>
<li>Ju Hong, white parts removed, each one liang</li>
<li>Mang Xiao, ground, two qian</li>
<li>Lianqiao</li>
<li>Jiegeng</li>
<li>Xiangfuzi, soaked in light salt water and stir-fried, each half liang</li>
<li>Qingshi, ground separately, one qian</li>
</ul>
<p>The above ingredients are ground into a fine powder. Then, mix with a little honey and ginger juice, and shape into pills the size of longan. Chew one pill with clear soup and swallow slowly; alternatively, shape pills the size of mung beans and swallow five to sixty pills with light ginger soup. </p>
<p>Such chronic phlegm is often found in individuals who drink alcohol frequently. The vapors from alcohol rise, causing fire evil to affect both the lungs and stomach, leading to accumulation and phlegm formation. This prescription includes Tianmen Dong and Huangqin to drain lung heat, Hai Fen and Mang Xiao to soften hardness, (Caoshe) Lou to moisten the lungs and resolve phlegm, Xiangfu and Lianqiao to alleviate stagnation and lower heat, and Qingshi to clear stagnation fire, which is why there are no acrid or drying ingredients used.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: The method of guiding phlegm and fire involves stretching the legs while sitting firmly, using both hands to perform the Child’s Method, applying force to lift up, lowering the head and bending the body, then pulling back the toes three times. As with the method, exert force to rise, swallow saliva, and lower it into the mysterious gate, bending up twenty-four times, and then maintaining the practice afterwards. </p>
<p>In practicing the technique, achieve tranquility by using the sixteen-character phrase to guide the swallow at noon, focusing on the navel and keeping thoughts present. Next, practice the tailbone movements eight or nine times; entering tranquility naturally allows phlegm and fire to descend. For phlegm-related ailments, first concentrate on the area of pain, then push open the large intestine, guiding it towards the valley path to facilitate the flow of qi. </p>
<p>For phlegm in the chest, press both hands below the nipples and knead several times. One must focus and nurture qi, then consciously widen the chest, envisioning the upper jiao qi descending to the lower jiao, thereby allowing the diaphragm to open and phlegm to transform.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Zhangfeng Village by Tangxi, there was an elderly farmer named Yang who had been suffering from vomiting sour water for more than ten years. Initially, he relied on traditional drinks for relief, but various doctors treated him with drying agents, applied moxibustion and needles to his stomach and navel, yet the sores never healed. A healer used bitter medicine to aid him, and as he spat out thick phlegm, he managed to expel two to three liters of it and laughed as he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman, since her youth, had cried deeply, then drank ice-cold water excessively, leading to a blockage of water at her heart and subsequently to painful discomfort. Doctors all believed it was due to cold accumulation, treating her with warming medicines and prohibiting cold foods. However, just the smell of tea would trigger her symptoms. This lasted for several years, during which she underwent moxibustion and needle treatments, leading to dozens of sores. Over ten years, her urine became reddish-yellow, her bowels constipated, her vision worsened, and she accumulated water which greatly increased, flowing to her sides. People deemed it &quot;water constitution&quot; or &quot;edema disorder.&quot; They applied various rough medicines to penetrate her condition, but her appetite waned over time, and the accumulation persisted, affecting her from her sternum down to her sides and lower abdomen. Whenever she had an episode, pressing her abdomen sounded like water splashing, it became hard and sensitive, with episodes occurring five to seven times a month, sometimes so severe she felt she might die. Medicine became distasteful to her over more than twenty years until she sought the help of a healer.</p>
<p>Upon examining her pulse, he found it deep and slow at the cun position, indicating phlegm in her chest. He first used Gua Ti San to help her expel five to seven liters of phlegm; within a few days, more phlegm and water followed. After several more days, she expelled several more liters. In total, she had three rounds of expulsion and three rounds of sweating, all of the accumulated fluids were eliminated. With a prescription of medicines to disperse dampness and resolve edema, she improved significantly within a month.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a></p></div>

Everyone thought it was a case of a problematic pregnancy and sought countless remedies, including acupuncture, poisonous drugs, and prayers, all to no avail. One day, a man named Dai examined her and said: &quot;This is cold phlegm.&quot; He checked her pulse and found it deep; surely it was cold phlegm. He used a gourd seed powder to induce vomiting, and she expelled six to seven liters, reducing the mass by more than half. After a few days, she vomited again, producing about two to three liters of frothy, foul-smelling bile resembling chicken yolk. This was repeated three times, after which he adjusted her treatment with ginseng and Wuling powder, and her abdomen returned to normal.</p>

As the years went on, his episodes became more frequent; he saw black spots and would become disoriented for three to four days before recovering. Various doctors prescribed southern star and pinellia herbs to resolve the phlegm, but none were effective. By chance, he met a man named Dai in the southern countryside by the river. Dai used a method to induce sweating with a double solution, followed by a bitter agent to expel phlegm, and the illness improved by eight to nine parts; he continued with the adjusted doses from spring to autumn, and after several treatments, he was completely cured.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a></p></div>

Some suggested using Sanhua Shenyou Pills, but he feared their potency; others recommended Wuling Powder, but it was too mild and ineffective. After several months without results, his limbs and kidneys swelled, and he became constipated. 常仲明 sought treatment from Master Dai, who instructed him to take medicine, but by the time he arrived, he had already passed away.

His chest felt slightly more at ease, and he continued to take them daily without stopping for over a year, becoming increasingly worn out. When he rented a boat to come for my consultation, his flesh had greatly wasted away, and his pulse felt like floating silk, with the Tai Xi pulse completely absent. Seeing my troubled expression, he said: &#39;I too believe I will inevitably die, but the bloating in my diaphragm is unbearable, and my constipation is severe. If I could just feel relief for a moment, I would die with my eyes closed.&#39; Pressured by his dire state, I prescribed a strong formula. Despite the emotional struggle of being close relatives, I advised using a large dose of ginseng and white atractylodes decoction. Shortly thereafter, he went to the toilet and expelled several liters of accumulated phlegm, feeling relief and comfort in his chest.

During the day, she experienced intense pain in the chest and diaphragm, as if pierced by knives, which ceased by evening; however, her knees were in severe pain, likely due to the phlegm and fluid rising and falling with respiration. One physician diagnosed it as a cold stomach condition and treated it with dried ginger, ginger, cinnamon, aconite, rhizome, and other herbs, along with a pepper porridge, which worsened her condition, increasing her thirst and causing frequent urination. </p>
<p>Seeking my treatment, I diagnosed her pulse as strong, rapid, and slippery. I formulated a treatment to clear phlegm and instructed her to cook bamboo sap urgently. After three days, her thirst diminished, and her urination improved, but the pain in her chest and knees persisted as before. I gave her half a bowl of juice from radish seeds, resulting in the expulsion of about half a liter of phlegm. </p>
<p>That night, the pain intensified, reflecting the unrest mentioned by Danxi about the rebellious nature of the illness. The next day, I administered one ounce of ginseng and prepared a decoction with reverse flowing water, which did not induce vomiting. The following day, I provided a decoction of bitter fleece-flower root, which also failed to induce vomiting, and then gave her a combination of aconite and platycodon radix, which still did not cause vomiting. One morning, I used one qian of processed villous green plant and added a small amount of musk, mixing it with sour juice for her to take, resulting in a significant vomiting episode. By the next morning, her vomiting stabilized. Over this time, she expelled a small bucket&#39;s worth of stubborn phlegm and thick fluid, and her pain was alleviated.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li Yang&#39;s young son was afflicted with phlegm and wheezing, not nursing or eating for five days and nights, and the doctor warned that it was critical. That night, his wife dreamed of Guanyin, who gave her a decoction of ginseng and walnut. Li hurriedly obtained about an inch of ginseng from Silla and one walnut, brewed them in a clam shell&#39;s worth of water, and administered it; the wheezing immediately ceased. The next day, after removing the walnut&#39;s skin and using it again, the wheezing returned. Using it with the skin still attached, he trusted the remedy overnight and was cured. This remedy is not included in any texts. It is said that ginseng calms wheezing, and walnut with the skin can consolidate lung function.</p>
<p>Zhong Cung&#39;s son, Zhang Zheng, struggled with phlegm, suffering from symptoms similar to colds or changes in weather whenever he ate until full, experiencing headaches and chills, with sour vomiting every ten days. He would lie down for several days without food; medicines provided no relief. In the early years of Xuanhe, while serving in Shunchang, he obtained a recipe for a Dan from Wu, and after taking it, he never experienced those symptoms again. Whenever he overindulged in food and felt full, he would take five to seventy pills, which sufficed. Shortly after, his urination carried the scent of evodia, and all alcoholic drinks left with his urine. He tried many phlegm remedies previously, none compared to this. He soaked Wu Zhu Yu (evodia) in water seven times, ground it with poria into a powder, and mixed it with honey into walnut-sized pills; he took fifty of them with warm water. The Mei Yangqing formula only used evodia, soaked in wine for three nights, and mixed with powdered poria, dried in the sun, swallowing a hundred pills each day with warm wine.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a></p></div>

After taking medicine to eliminate heat and transform phlegm, the phlegm condition worsened, and his limbs became unresponsive. I diagnosed it as spleen deficiency with damp-heat and treated him, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Grand Counselor Li Beiquan had persistent phlegm expectoration, internal heat causing thirst, and body fatigue with resulting foot heat. After using medicine to clear qi and transform phlegm, his condition worsened. I suggested that this was due to kidney water overflowing and causing phlegm, so he needed to tonify the kidneys. Skeptical, he insisted on taking more phlegm-dispelling pills. He experienced continuous vomiting and diarrhea, could not eat, and his head felt heavy with closed eyes. Finally, he believed me. I then prescribed several doses of Liu Junzi Decoction to stabilize his stomach qi and followed with Liu Wei Wan for over a month, leading to the complete resolution of all symptoms.</p>
<p>Elder Liang Houzhai had shortness of breath with phlegm, red and painful urination, heel pain, and a floating and large pulse that felt weak upon palpation. This was a case of kidney deficiency with phlegm accumulation. I administered Si Wu Decoction combined with Liu Wei Wan, and he recovered in less than a month. As taught by Master Zhang Zhongjing, when there is qi deficiency with phlegm, one should use Kidney Qi Pills to tonify and eliminate it. Truly, it enlightens the ignorant and rescues the constrained. The Kidney Qi Pill is indeed the Liu Wei Wan.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Du Xian Meng had a shortness of breath with a lot of phlegm, leading to urinary issues, with a significant swelling that felt like there was nothing there when pressed. I believed that the kidney function was incapable of properly taking in breath, and the strong aromatic herbs exacerbated the issue. Using the Ba Wei pill in three doses cured him.</p>
<p>Gao Tong Shi was drinking at the ZHOU Shang She residence and asked me: &quot;Meng Youya and Chen Donggu both had no offspring and then fell ill, resulting in vomiting phlegm; both used Suhe Xiang pills, yet only Youya survived. Why is that?&quot; I replied: &quot;Both cases stem from kidney deficiency that cannot take in breath, leading to head wind and the inability to control water, resulting in phlegm. Donggu emphasized treating phlegm to move qi, while Youya focused on supporting fire and tonifying qi.&quot; Later, at the request of a Hangzhou person, after Gao Tong Shi overworked himself, he experienced similar symptoms. Using methods to clear qi and transform phlegm made him worse. He remarked: &quot;My illness is due to kidney deficiency that cannot return breath to its source.&quot; Unfortunately, the physician did not realize it and he passed away, what a pity!</p>
<p>One man had a preference for rich food and suffered from chest fullness and excessive phlegm. I said: &quot;A person with rich diet tends to accumulate heat.&quot; I prescribed the Qing Qi Hua Tan pill and he was cured. This was effective and showed that those with weak spleen and stomach would inevitably suffer.</p>
<p>My older brother had a robust appearance but produced much phlegm. His pulse was strong and full, yet he could not endure exertion, often experiencing a head wind that made him faint, and had oral sores that would sometimes become red and ulcerated. After mistakenly eating a little ginger and garlic, his mouth sores worsened. He took the Ba Wei pill and added a tonifying midsection and qi with Fu Zi, and he recovered. After stopping the medication for over a month, the symptoms recurred. This indicated a deficiency of the life gate fire that did not return to its source, so he continued taking the previous medicine and was cured again.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar experienced labor and then had little appetite, felt a tightness in the chest, developed a fever and headache, coughed up phlegm, and felt thirsty, with a pulse that was floating and large. I believed this was due to a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi and related to a blood condition. When I was not believed, he took herbs like Erchen and Siwu, Huangbo, and Zhimu, resulting in abdominal pain and vomiting, with a pulse that was surging, rapid, and disordered. Initially, I prescribed Liu Junzi Decoction with roasted ginger, and his pain and vomiting gradually improved. I followed up with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he fully recovered.</p>
<p>Scholar Xu Yan had a dry mouth and phlegm, wanting to take Qiongyu Paste. I advised him that this was a remedy to subdue yin and lower fire. He had a pale face, dry mouth, and phlegm, suggesting a deficiency of spleen and lung qi; thus, he should use warming and tonifying remedies. He did not believe me and insisted on taking it. After more than two months, he had loose stools, little appetite, and also developed impotence; only then did he start to believe my words. I first used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Poria and Banxia to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach. Gradually, his appetite increased, and his stools became firmer. After stopping those two herbs and taking the formula for over a month, he fully recovered; moreover, after taking Liuwei Dihuang Wan for more than three months, his condition returned to normal. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Qiongyu Paste, Guben Wan, and Kanli Wan are all remedies for reducing cold and lowering fire; they should not be taken by those whose intestines and stomach are not dry and hot. If someone with yin deficiency in the three yin channels takes them for a long time, it may render them childless. This is because it depletes their yang qi, resulting in insufficient yin blood for generation, as has been repeatedly observed.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Within Yangshan, the individual is prone to anger, experiences discomfort in the chest, produces excessive phlegm, swallows sour and putrid substances, has diminished appetite, and feels heat in the hands and feet. The medications taken are not likely to be for clearing heat such as Chuanqionghua and Zhi Shi, but should instead include ingredients like Bingsu and Houpo. The left pulse is strong and full, while the right is weak and rapid. I believe this indicates liver fire and blood dryness, with wood overpowering earth. </p>
<p>In the morning, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the liver wood; in the evening, employ Liu Junzi Decoction with added Donggui and Shaoyao to tonify the spleen earth. Recovery should occur in less than a month. However, if anger arises again, the previous ailment may reoccur. One might take Er Chen Tang with Gypsum, leading to a surge of saliva, external heat resembling burning, and a strong, large pulse that feels empty upon pressure. I argue that the spleen governs saliva, and its deficiency leads to heat and excessive salivation.</p>
<p>Using Liu Junzi with Ginger and Cinnamon will allow for immediate sleep, resulting in the sudden disappearance of all symptoms, with a few doses leading to recovery. However, if one takes medications for regulating qi or transforming phlegm, symptoms such as abdominal distension, shortness of breath, leg swelling, knee edema, and dripping may develop.

He took medicine to resolve phlegm and promote qi, but felt full in the chest and his abdomen swelled, with phlegm increasing. He then took medicine to guide phlegm and regulate the spleen, but his belly expanded, and he had difficulty with urination and defecation. After that, he took medicine to disperse qi and relieve water retention; his abdomen became large, and he had pain in the sides, preventing him from sleeping. Upon taking medicine to break blood and guide out, he had swelling in both legs and his pulses were large at the joints, but weak at the inch pulse. I diagnosed his condition as phlegm caused by spleen deficiency and prescribed modified Kidney Qi Pills in the morning and tonic decoction in the evening. After a month, his symptoms gradually improved, and he could eat more. Then, I prescribed Eight Flavor Pills and the tonic decoction again. After another month, he could turn over, and in two months, he was able to walk. Eventually, he took Complete Qi Tonic Decoction and a rejuvenating pill, and after half a year, he fully recovered. Later, if he lost regulation slightly, his abdomen would swell again, but taking the previous medicine would cure him.</p>
<p>My old colleague Qian Kejiu, who enjoyed drinking, had a red face and excessive phlegm, with unformed stools. I considered his condition as damp phlegm stagnating in the intestines and stomach, so I prescribed a formula including Erchen, Qinjiao, Lian, Shan Zhi, Zhishi, Gande, Zexie, and Shengma. He coughed up a lot of phlegm, and his stool became firm. After that, he drank a decoction of Huanglian three qian daily and felt at ease.</p>
<p>Heng Jincheng also had a red face, coughed up phlegm, and occasionally experienced diarrhea. I prescribed something similar to Erchen, Huanglian, and Zhishi, but it did not work for him.

After taking herbal formulas such as Qinjian, she experienced cold and heat, dry mouth, and drooling; she then ate a piece of winter melon, which intensified her vomiting. I assessed that her spleen was weak and cold. I urgently applied a warm poultice of salt, mugwort, and aconite to her navel and abdomen. Additionally, her son inhaled her breath to connect with her spirit, which slightly revived her. I ground ginseng, poria, aconite, and dried tangerine peel into powder and formed pills the size of millet, instructing her to swallow five to seven pills, increasing to more than ten the next day.

<p>A woman with weak spleen and stomach, who had little appetite, suddenly experienced phlegm obstructing her breath, shaking her head and eyes, and throwing her hands and feet, making it hard to take her pulse.

<p>Another woman, whose vital energy was naturally weak, experienced phlegm and qi disruptions, with symptoms like discomfort in the throat and chest fullness. I believed it to be due to stress harming her spleen, so I treated her with a modified Gui Pi Tang, and she recovered. Later, encountering anger, her previous symptoms recurred. Confused by various opinions, she thought it was due to phlegm and hastily used phlegm-dispelling medications, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea, altering her symptoms to a state of silence and unconsciousness.

<p>Zhou Pan Jiang Dayong, fifty years old, was robust but felt fullness and phlegm, with headaches upon exertion. He had only taken medications to clear phlegm and regulate qi. I remarked that fullness indicated a deficiency of spleen qi; excessive phlegm meant the spleen could not move it; headaches indicated the spleen&#39;s qi could not rise; and numbness suggested deficiency in the spleen&#39;s ability to circulate.

He attempted to resolve the phlegm, which led to great thirst and a feeling of heat and discomfort in the head. I determined that it was a case of weak central qi causing a transformation of symptoms, and treated him with a formula to replenish the central qi and enhance energy, resulting in recovery. Later, he exerted himself and developed a fever and discomfort in the head; I believed the qi was too weak to rise. I used the previous formula and added vitex to help him recover. Afterward, he became mentally fatigued and was averse to wind and cold, with reversed cold in the limbs, excessive phlegm saliva in his mouth. I diagnosed this as a true case of spleen deficiency and cold, and treated him with a modification of the Six Gentleman Decoction by adding roasted ginger and cinnamon, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A man with a chronic kidney deficiency and phlegm cough also employed methods to resolve phlegm, which led to all the signs of deficiency. Phlegm saliva surged upward, and he experienced frequent urination. I diagnosed it as a depletion of the three yin meridians that had worsened.

He considered using medicine to resolve this, but the phlegm surged upward, leading to dizziness, feelings of heat, thirst, constipation, a preference for cold food and drinks, and heat in the hands and feet. I inferred that his kidney water was weak, making it difficult for fluids to descend. The spoiled fluids became phlegm, and I treated him with six flavor pills, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A 75-year-old man experienced widespread pain, particularly in the muscles and bones, with an inability to bend or stretch.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Minister Liu Ziyan suffered from pain and weakness in his lower body due to overwork, accompanied by fever and excessive phlegm. He was given a clear drying decoction mixed with bamboo juice and ginger juice, which reduced the heat and pain by half; another dose cured him completely.</p>
<p>A woman experienced coughing with phlegm and pain in her chest, with a floating and slippery pulse at the right wrist, and tightness in the neck. This was due to heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach producing phlegm, not a lung abscess. She was treated with the Erchen Decoction, adding gardenia, white attractor, and platycodon, and she recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Guidelines&quot; states: A woman aged twenty, somewhat overweight and quick-tempered, after being angry, developed a cough with phlegm and nausea. She was given the Erchen Decoction with additional ingredients to soothe the qi, reduce fire, and resolve phlegm. It was as if throwing water against a stone; gradually she coughed violently, making strange noises day and night without pause. The ancients referred to “coughing reversely” as a series of fifty or seventy sounds in quick succession, or sometimes thirty or fifty. This case involved continuous sound without end, which seemed indicative of severe illness. Her pulse was floating and slightly surging, with a sinking, slightly slippery touch. I decided to give her a rolling phlegm pill, but it had no effect. I believed phlegm was stagnant between the stomach and chest, preventing the qi from flowing. Only through coughing could it be expelled, so I used a preparation of melon stem powder mixed with sour jujube water, using a goose feather to help induce vomiting, resulting in a bowlful of phlegm being expelled, and her cough ceased, silent and effective.</p>
<p>After two days, due to eating noodles and meat sauce, she again developed coughing and regurgitation. I gave her clear phlegm and qi-soothing medicine, but it did not work. I reasoned that the phlegm she had expelled the previous day was not fully eliminated, so she needed to vomit again. After another effort, she expelled about half a bowl of phlegm and was then cured.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a></p></div>

One day, he first felt cold, then developed a fever, experiencing slight head pain, frequent dizziness, as if he could not bear the weight, and restless heat that did not subside. He tried to sweat it out with a ginseng and perilla drink, but it did not help and sought treatment. Upon examining his pulse, it was deep, surging, and slippery. I concluded there was definitely phlegm-heat stagnation. I prescribed a modified Er Chen decoction with Scutellaria, Phragmites, Gastrodia, and the excrement of ferment, along with pill to expel phlegm. However, the next day, he still had restless heat and persistent coughing with phlegm. This is precisely what Danxi said: when phlegm is in the diaphragm, it must be vomited; it cannot be expelled by purging. I used Gua Ti San to induce vomiting and gathered about half a bowl of phlegm, but he stopped out of fear of bitterness. I felt that the small amount of phlegm was insufficient to be effective; the restless heat remained the same. However, with a combination of Ginseng Bai Hu Decoction and Wuling San, he still did not improve. I said: the stagnation is heavy, making it hard to vomit it out, and purging does not relieve it, so a remedy to disperse the stagnation is needed. I then used a modified Er Chen with Qian Hu, Chai Hu, Ge Gen, Jie Geng, Cang Zhu, Chuan Xiong, and ginger juice-fried Scutellaria and Gardenia.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: Mr. Qian Shuweng, an elderly gentleman, has a thin physique and usually has a lot of heat and little phlegm. In recent years, the heat within him has combined with humidity to produce phlegm. In the autumn of the Xin Si year, with a mixture of dampness and heat, he suddenly suffered from numbness in his right foot, feeling as cold as ice or stone. This was due to extreme heat manifesting as cold, similar to the summer months when rain and hail occur. The doctors, observing the coldness of his foot, did not discern that it was extreme heat resembling cold, mistakenly prescribed warming herbs such as cowherb, papaya, and others; they furthermore believed that his lower energy was depleted, wrongly using warming tonics like cinnamon and aconite.</p>
<p>By adding fire to fire and heat to heat, his condition worsened, leading to swelling and discharge of pus. Over several months, it spread down to the ankle bones, causing swelling in the back of the foot and toes, rendering them unusable. This was entirely due to mismanagement of treatment. The reasoning is quite clear and not difficult to differentiate. If it were just cold phlegm sinking down, it would merely cause hardening and not dispersing; at worst, it would lead to weakness and numbness. How could it result in swelling and pus, with yellow water oozing and decaying flesh penetrating tendons? Mr. Taiweng, unaware of the medical errors, blamed it on the deities in the corners, but could it truly be so? This is not much different from the complications of typhoid where heat invades the meridians and causes flux.</p>
<p>The ginseng paste used only focused on replenishing the vital energy, without any medications to clear and resolve the damp heat, which is why there was no evident resolution of the symptoms.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a></p></div>

If ginseng works in harmony with bamboo leaf, ginseng strengthens the meridians, and bamboo leaf opens the collaterals, then their sweet and cold properties would complement each other wonderfully. Master Xu Taiye took ginseng to treat his deficiency wind, but mistakenly combined it with the heat of aconite. To this day, his sinews are shortened and he cannot move freely, which is due to his lack of understanding of how sweet and cold can open the meridians. Moreover, after the old gentleman used ginseng paste, his spleen qi became robust and his digestive function improved.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>On the day of an eclipse, along with night eating, although the spleen&#39;s energy is robust and not harmed by food, it is indeed regrettable that the spleen&#39;s energy, generated by ginseng, is solely used to process food and not to move phlegm or heat. Nowadays, food intake is also difficult to process, which, instead of promoting health, leads to decline, causing phlegm and fluids to accumulate in the chest, resulting in fullness and discomfort, as well as frequent coughing with phlegm not being expelled. This is fundamentally due to the spleen losing its strength, and not because the stomach is able to move fluids; rather, food intake generates phlegm, gradually saturating the lung pathways, making coughing difficult.</p>
<p>Although treating phlegm is urgent, the medicines for phlegm generally exhaust energy and induce deficiency, thus risking that phlegm may not be expelled before pathogenic wind enters. The only proper way is to use sweet and cold medicines to quell wind, dispel heat, moisten dryness, and replenish deficiency, thereby opening phlegm. As for spicy and warming medicines, they must not be mistakenly used again. Physicians clearly see this, yet they continue to use large amounts of cinnamon and other warming agents, presumably thinking them effective because purulent fluid easily dries up, and thus they push vigorously for a resolution. Is this not deserving of condemnation?<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The old man You is robust and shows vitality, never suffering from illness or invasion of pathogens. However, every morning, he must expel a few mouthfuls of phlegm after bathing his face, habitually rubbing his chest and stimulating the energy beneath his ribs. If he sleeps soundly at night and has clear pathways for water, he feels refreshed in his chest. His symptoms resemble illness but are not truly so. After extensive examination of medical texts and inquiring with knowledgeable doctors, no clear answer could be found. Chang posited that this is phlegm and fluid accumulating in the chest cavity, with a minor stagnation formed due to his vigorous energy, leading to simultaneous gathering and expulsion. Thus, the phlegm and fluid do not cause harm; however, the energy in the chest can be injured by the act of expulsion. The chest region, or “Dan Zhong,” is at the same level as the upper burner. The classics state that the upper burner is like mist, indicating that its energy is diffused like fog. It also states that Dan Zhong is the official in charge of distributing energy within the chest and transmitting it downward. Now, due to frequent expulsions, the diffused energy turns into urgency and ascends, but when settled, it resumes its downward distribution, thus not causing harm. Generally, phlegm is the symptom while energy is the root; treating the symptom is easy, but treating the root is difficult. The difficulty in treating the root lies in the fact that previous sages have never discussed methods for it, leaving later generations unaware of how to treat it. Chang attempted to theorize on this: there are three sources of energy to address: First is lung energy. When lung energy is clear, the body&#39;s energy flows smoothly downward, and the old man’s lung energy is typically clear. Second is stomach energy. When stomach energy is harmonious, the energy within the chest also flows more easily downward, and the old man’s stomach energy is usually harmonious. Third is bladder energy.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the energy of the bladder is strong, it can attract the energy within the chest to descend. Therefore, young students should cultivate this energy, which is inherently vigorous. If the energy in the heart region is chaotic, it can be treated immediately; if it is disturbed, it can be calmed right away. This depends on the subtle transport of these three energies, so one does not perceive their burdens, and this is called being free from illness. However, when these three energies oppose the chest diaphragm, the resulting tightness and distension can hardly be tolerated! Thus, undiagnosed illnesses may remain unspoken, but the occurring energies must urgently return to their balance. The patient may feel tormented by phlegm and fluids, attempting to expel the energy through breathing, thereby dislodging phlegm from the chest diaphragm, yet unaware that this phlegm cannot be expelled and only damages the energy. Indeed, at night, phlegm accumulates in the stomach, and upon waking, it can be naturally vomited out; during the day, the stomach&#39;s fluids circulate through the organs, and even if stimulated, they will not be expelled.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, when phlegm is resolved, the qi will naturally be smooth; therefore, treating phlegm should be a priority. However, when the body is full of phlegm, it is not easily eliminated, and one must first strengthen the spleen; when the spleen is strong, new phlegm does not form. As for the old phlegm that is lodged in the body&#39;s cavities, it gradually penetrates the stomach and is dispersed both above and below; thus, without phlegm there is no vomiting, without vomiting the qi remains undisturbed, and when the qi is undisturbed, it will gradually return to its harmonious state. Nevertheless, there is still a critical point that must be addressed. The human chest is vast and empty like the great void; when the earth&#39;s qi rises, it becomes clouds. The heavenly qi must descend to become rain, and the earth&#39;s qi then begins to collect and remain still. Indeed, if the upper Jiao is like mist, the middle Jiao like fermentation, and the lower Jiao like a channel, one will understand how clouds move and rain falls, and as a result, all waterways will be filled, and the paths will be cleared, bringing a new scene to the universe. This principle places vital importance on the bladder meridian.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: The bladder is the official of the capital region; it stores the fluids, and when Qi is transformed, it can be expelled. Just as a person can drink without limit and not become drunk, this is all due to the Qi transformation of the bladder. The Zang Zhong (the area of the heart) is located within the diaphragm, while the bladder is situated in the abdomen. When the Qi of the bladder transforms, it creates a hollow space that is good for storage, allowing the Qi of the Zang Zhong to descend; if the bladder does not transform, the abdomen will already be distended, making it impossible for the Qi of the Zang Zhong to descend.</p>
<p>However, in order for the bladder&#39;s Qi to transform, its authority lies in preserving the kidneys, as the kidneys regard the bladder as a cavity. When kidney Qi moves, it must first flow into the bladder. If the movement is excessive and persistent, the bladder becomes full and distended, inevitably causing a reverse flow into the chest and diaphragm, resulting in a blockage that cannot be easily described. If the kidney Qi is not active, then its storage becomes firmer, allowing the bladder to remain clear and unaffected, thus the Qi of the Zang Zhong cannot be overfilled.</p>
<p>When the Qi of the Zang Zhong flows downward swiftly, it is not disturbed by the pulls of excess, and the chest feels open as if in the vastness of space. Chang Geng further states: When Qi is flowing smoothly, phlegm does not linger; thus, without treating the phlegm, it eliminates itself. The servant asked: Phlegm in the diaphragm is not far from the throat, and it must cause pain and vomiting each morning; why is this? The answer: It is a difference in pathways. Between the chest and diaphragm lies a thick layer of fatty membranes, completely blocking any gaps; from where can the phlegm escape? What comes out is just the phlegm from the stomach. The servant asked: Then does the phlegm in the diaphragm not come out? The answer: How could it not come out? It is just that expulsion is challenging.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Qi of the diaphragm spreads throughout the twelve meridians. When it spreads to the six Yang meridians of the hands and feet, the Qi rises and exits from the throat; when it spreads to the six Yin meridians of the hands and feet, the Qi descends and exits from the front and back Yin. However, the Qi that exits from below is unobstructed, while the Qi that exits from above must first descend to the Yangming before it can rise, which makes it more difficult. It is said that this discussion of the transformation of the bladder Qi is profoundly subtle. Yet, the mechanism of suction is not seen in the classics; could it possibly have a source? It is stated that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; contains the principle of the Greater Yang drawing the essence, but due to the lack of annotations, people cannot comprehend it. The Greater Yang refers to the bladder of the Sun. This means that the bladder can draw down the Qi from the chest, resulting in the dissipation of the distension in the chest, which serves as sufficient proof.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: The theory of the &quot;cavity in the chest&quot; is indeed certain and without doubt, but one does not know what caused it, where it ends, or when it dissipates. It is said: The Qi of the human body, when abundant, flows into the meridians; when the meridians are abundant, Qi flows into the collaterals. The origin of the cavity begins with phlegm accumulating at the stomach, and during vomiting, the stomach Qi moves several times, with half emerging from the throat and half entering the collaterals. The collaterals of the stomach pass through the diaphragm. When the Qi rushes in urgently, it penetrates the diaphragm, allowing the phlegm to settle there. Once the phlegm has been there for a long time, it obstructs the airway, and the rushing Qi forms another cavity, like a bee&#39;s nest, growing day by day, hence making treatment very difficult. One must first eliminate the phlegm in the stomach without causing vomiting or irritation, so that the Qi of the stomach does not rush into the collaterals, allowing the stomach to become more receptive to the Qi returning from the collaterals. Gradually, using medicine to guide the cavity and clear away the phlegm, healing will occur spontaneously. This understanding is unique to me and has been tested multiple times.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Huang, my esteemed brother, the lady is suffering from phlegm obstructing the passages. There is stagnation between the liver, lungs, and pericardium; there is weakness in all three pulse sections, with excess evil and deficient righteousness, making it difficult to disperse. If one wishes to use an expelling method to slightly induce a吐 (vomit) of about thirty percent, it would indeed be a relief. However, upon careful consideration, this method is hardly feasible. The expelling technique is like a military tactic, where security and danger are easily reversed; it is inherently perilous. Moreover, phlegm is merely a fleeting disturbance; if we apply expelling medicine, the phlegm may stir and be expelled just as someone is about to address it. However, the point of entry is blocked, and the qi cannot descend. The medicinal effect conflicts with the pathological condition, possibly leading to days of unconsciousness. What can be done? Ultimately, as Danxi stated: if expulsion is feared, should it not be better to nourish and guide it downward? The phlegm in the passages cannot be led downward; it merely consumes the spleen qi, causing further obstruction. This method is not advisable either. For the current plan, it is necessary to focus on nourishing the spleen first. The spleen qi is the yang energy that supports health and movement in the body, much like the sun in the sky. When the yin condenses and blocks, it is as if the sun has lost its position; when phlegm obscures perception, it signifies that the spleen has lost its authority. Nourishing the spleen is akin to the blazing sun at its zenith; can a wisp of cloud obscure it? Next, nothing is better than clearing the lungs.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs are the organ of the general and commander. When the qi is clear, it will be solemn and descend; when the qi descends, phlegm will serve as a stronghold, illustrating flaws that can be targeted for attack. The saying goes, “To attack the strong, even flaws are strong; to attack flaws, the strong also have flaws.” Now, with the limbs swollen and numb, the qi is extremely stagnant, and it cannot be neglected. </p>
<p>To address this condition, the method concerning the spleen must combine medicine with diet. White rice, fragrant vegetables, and bitter tea are preferable. It is essential to avoid smooth and greasy foods; even porridge should not be consumed, as it tends to form phlegm easily. Not only should mixed foods be avoided, but rice should also be reduced to prevent spleen qi from being used to digest grains; instead, it should be used to eliminate phlegm, which is much more effective than medication.</p>
<p>Spicy, alcoholic, and sun-dried foods all harm the lungs and should be avoided. As for medication, there is a particular order to follow, waiting for gradual improvement and full recovery in the coming spring. Due to this illness, patients do not understand treatment, and the sages of old also did not have superior methods. However, after much thought, I believe the key lies here. </p>
<p>Therefore, those who want to sustain this must agree with the strategies of a fortified city, first eliminating the smaller issues and then eliminating the major ones, as this is not something easily achieved. It is said that the onset of phlegm originates from the liver and gallbladder; in winter, the wood qi returns to its root, preventing aggressive treatment. Thus, we only use spleen-regulating medicines. Only when spring arrives, with the wood qi flourishing, should we employ the Four Gentlemen Decoction, adding gentian, aloe, realgar, coptis, and indigo among other herbs in pill form. This will resolve the symptoms of phlegm obstruction, leading to complete recovery and preventing future occurrences.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>
