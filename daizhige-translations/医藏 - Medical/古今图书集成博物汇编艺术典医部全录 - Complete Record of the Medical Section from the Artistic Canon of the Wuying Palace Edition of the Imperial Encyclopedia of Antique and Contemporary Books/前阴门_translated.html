<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor’s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>At sixty years of age, there is impotence, a significant weakening of qi, the nine orifices are not functioning well, there is deficiency below and fullness above, and both tears and mucus flow out. [Note: At sixty, one has already surpassed seventy or eighty years. The heavenly essence is exhausted, kidney qi significantly weakens, resulting in impotence. The nine orifices depend on the qi of water; when essence is depleted, and vital essence declines, the nine orifices become dysfunctional. With essence exhausted below and fluid overflowing above, both tears and mucus will be present.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When the diseases of the two Yang emerge, they affect the heart and spleen, and there can be no hiding of curves; if a woman does not menstruate, it is transmitted as wind dissipating. When it conveys to difficult breathing, it is incurable. [Note: The two Yang refers to the foot Yangming stomach channel. A woman&#39;s essence and blood are nourished by the water and grains of the stomach, while the spleen governs the movement of essence and liquid from the stomach. When the two Yang are sick, the fluids of the middle burner are exhausted, and there is no means to nourish the heart spirit and transform blood, resulting in blood deficiency. If the spleen cannot transport and transform the essence of grains and water to the five organs, the kidneys have nowhere to store essence, leading to essence deficiency. If a man lacks essence, it cannot fulfill the need of curved concealment; if a woman lacks blood, then menstruation cannot arrive on time. This illness originates from the two Yang and manifests in the heart and spleen. With both essence and blood deficient, there arises a strong heat leading to wind; with the interaction of wind and heat, body fluids become increasingly depleted. The fire burns fiercely, conveying as urgent breathing and shoulder lifting, leading to inevitable death. The stomach is the origin of body fluids, while the lungs are responsible for their transformation.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The Three Yang conditions manifest as fever and chills, resulting in carbuncles and swellings, as well as atrophy and weakness (of the limbs). They transmit to form a constricted, dry state and can lead to deficiencies and hernias. </p>
<p>Note: The Three Yang refers to conditions of the Sun Yang. The Qi of the Sun Yang governs the exterior; when evils invade, they begin at the skin. When evils clash with the body&#39;s defenses, this develops into fever and chills. The Sun Yang also opens the body&#39;s pathways; when disease occurs, these pathways cannot open and close properly, resulting in external pathogenic influences causing internal issues like carbuncles and swellings. The Sun Yang governs all Yang energies and is responsible for the tendons; when the tendons are harmed, it leads to atrophy, and when energy is damaged, it results in weakness. All these conditions are related to the diseases of the Yang meridians. The Qi of the Sun Yang primarily affects the exterior and originates from the lower regions, hence the initial symptoms of fever and chills are found on the surface, gradually progressing to internal conditions like carbuncles, atrophy, and hernias. The Qi of the Sun Yang arises in the bladder, which is responsible for storing fluids; when the Qi transforms, fluids are expelled. If the Sun Yang&#39;s Qi becomes diseased with heat on the exterior and penetrates inward, it leads to depletion of fluids and the drying up of fluids. Hernias, characterized by swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, are known as bladder hernias. This shows how the disease begins at the surface and affects the root, starting with Qi and then affecting the meridians and tendons.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The Diagnosis of Key Patterns: Final Discussion</p>
<p>In the end stage of the Jueyin, there is internal heat, a dry throat, frequent urination, and a sense of restlessness. In severe cases, the tongue may roll back and the egg-shaped area may contract, leading to the end. This is the failure of the Jueyin channel.</p>
<p>[Note: The internal heat and dry throat occur because the wood and fire aspects of the Jueyin are about to cease. The diseases emanating from the liver lead to urinary incontinence, indicating the liver&#39;s energy is descending. The sense of restlessness arises from the upward inflammation of the envelope energy. The liver is associated with tendons, which converge in the reproductive organs and connect to the root of the tongue; hence, in severe cases, the tongue rolls back and the area may contract, indicating the failure of the Jueyin and the conclusion of the channel&#39;s energy.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>On Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>In the case of cold damage lasting six days, the Jueyin receives it. The Jueyin pulse follows the yin vessels and connects to the liver, hence the feeling of fullness and the contraction of the bladder. By the twelfth day, the Jueyin condition weakens, the bladder expands, the lower abdomen slightly descends, and all vital energy dissipates; the illness is thus nearing its end. [Note: The Jueyin, governed by wood and fire, controls qi, resulting in a feeling of fullness. The pulse follows the yin vessels, leading to bladder contraction. The cold pathogen is the most toxic, hence referred to as the great qi. By the twelfth day, the evil qi gradually diminishes, indicating a resurgence of the righteous qi.] When the illness arises from a dual exposure to cold, if it lasts three days, both the Shaoyang and Jueyin become affected, leading to deafness, bladder contraction, and cold extremities; fluids won’t enter, consciousness fades, and death may occur after six days. [Note: The Shaoyang and Jueyin correspond to exterior and interior, thus deafness appears in Shaoyang while contraction occurs in Jueyin. When fluids won’t enter, the path for vital energy is blocked. Fading consciousness indicates spirit and energy injury. If all the organs are affected and the nourishing and guarding energies do not circulate, the life energy ceases, leading to death.]</p>
<p><strong>On Wind</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of kidney wind include excessive sweating, aversion to wind, facial swelling appearing puffy, and spine pain preventing upright posture. The complexion is dark, and there are hidden bends making it difficult; examination reveals a dark color on the skin. [Note: When the wind pathogen affects the kidneys, water qi rises, thus causing facial swelling. Wind travels, leading to water loss. The kidneys govern the bones, hence the spine pain prevents upright posture. The kidneys store essence; the Shaoyin and Yangming converge at the governing vessel, and wind injures the kidney qi, leading to hidden bends. With water qi rising, the dark color appears on the skin, as water overcomes earth.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the yellow pulse is present, it is large and hollow, with accumulated qi in the abdomen, leading to a condition known as &quot;jue shan&quot; (syncope). The same applies to women. When this occurs suddenly, it causes the limbs to sweat in the presence of wind. <em>[Note: Sweating of the limbs in the presence of wind indicates that wind-dampness has intruded on the spleen, resulting in accumulated qi. The pathogenic wind of wood internally dries the spleen&#39;s earth, causing dampness and yin to react, thereby accumulating. If the spleen&#39;s qi cannot irrigate the surroundings, it will reverse and create jue qi. This condition is named &quot;jue shan&quot; due to the upward movement of qi causing pain.]</em> The black pulse&#39;s appearance is strong and large, with accumulated qi in the lower abdomen and the genitals, termed &quot;shen bi&quot; (kidney obstruction), which results from bathing in clear water and then lying down. <em>[Note: The measurement for the kidneys is taken at the wrist; when the black pulse is strong and large, it indicates accumulation in the kidneys, making the pulse substantial and pronounced. Its presence above indicates it is strong but not sinking. The relationship with the lower part involves the lower abdomen and the front genitals. The kidneys, governed by cold water, control qi as well.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essence of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: When diagnosing the heart pulse as urgent, what illness might this indicate? What does the condition resemble? Qi Bo replied: This illness is called heart syncope, and a defined shape should be found in the lower abdomen. The Emperor inquired: How do you conclude this? Qi Bo explained: The heart is considered the &quot;yang organ,&quot; while the small intestine is its assistant; hence it is said that the lower abdomen should reflect a tangible form. <em>[Note: All urgency implies coldness. The heart, being a yang organ, fears cold; hence the pulse is urgent. The heart, as the sovereign organ, does not succumb to pathogenic influences, thus the pulse emerges in the organ while its form is expressed in the bowel.]</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Theory of the Common Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If the cun (寸) pulse is deep and weak, it indicates cold and heat, and can lead to hernias and pain in the lower abdomen. [Note: Cun represents Yang, while deep signifies Yin. A deep and weak cun pulse indicates the deficiency of vital energy and the direct invasion of Yang pathogens into the inner Yin. The interplay of Yin and Yang leads to the classification of cold and heat. The invasion of Yang pathogens into the interior also results in hernias and lower abdominal pain.] If the pulse is rapid, it indicates hernias and lower abdominal pain.<br>[Note: Generally, rapid pulses signify cold, hence affirming the presence of internal hernias.]</p>
<p><strong>Theory of the Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>A rapidly deep pulse in the kidney or liver indicates hernias. A slippery and rapid pulse in the heart indicates a cardiac hernia. A deep and slippery pulse in the lung indicates a pulmonary hernia. Rapid pulses in the three Yang channels signify masses, while rapid pulses in the three Yin channels indicate hernias. [Note: A rapid pulse signifies deficiency, and a deep pulse indicates something located internally, thus alluding to hernias. The physical manifestation of a cardiac hernia is found in the lower abdomen, where the energy surges upwards to the heart, leading to a slippery and rapid heartbeat. A floating yet deep pulse in the lung suggests that lung energy is inversely consolidated within, forming a pulmonary hernia. Masses (瘕) are fictitious formations, created by abnormalities. The character for hernia (疝) resembles a mountain, suggesting a halt at an elevated place. Therefore, conditions influenced by the energy of the three Yang channels indicate masses, while those influenced by the energy of the three Yin channels denote hernias.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;Jueyin&quot; refers to the so-called (disease of) hernia, which presents as swelling in the lower abdomen of women. Jueyin corresponds to the time of Chen (the third of the twelve Earthly Branches). In the third month, as the sun is at its strongest and the yin is within, the evils reside internally, resulting in (disease of) hernia and lower abdominal swelling. </p>
<p>[Note: Jueyin is associated with wood and fire, which govern energy; hence it relates to the transition between March and April. In March, as yang is at its peak, Jueyin governs the energy, thus being referred to as yin amidst yang. The &quot;evil&quot; refers to the presence of yin energy; when the Jueyin energy is internal and has not fully expelled, it leads to (disease of) hernia and abdominal swelling.]</p>
<p>The so-called (disease of) hernia, accompanied by skin swelling, arises when yin is also excessive, causing the pulse to swell and become obstructed, hence it is called (disease of) hernia. </p>
<p>[Note: When it is stated that yin is also excessive, it means the Jueyin energy is excessive externally, leading to a swollen and obstructed pulse, which corresponds to (disease of) hernia and skin swelling. (Disease of) hernia is characterized by swelling of the reproductive organs, resulting in an inability to urinate.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Weakness</strong></p>
<p>Thoughts are endless, desires unattainable; one indulges in fantasies externally, and too much engagement in intimacy causes the foundational tendons to slacken, resulting in weakness of the tendons and potential succumbing to excess. Therefore, the &quot;Lower Classics&quot; state that weakness arises from the liver, affecting the internal aspect. </p>
<p>[Note: Endless thoughts and unattainable desires harm the liver&#39;s energy. The front channel gathers at the foundational tendons. The pulse of the Foot Jueyin flows through the inner thigh and into the hair areas, passing over the genital area. Fantasizing externally ignites internal desires, and excessive engagement in intimacy further weakens the foundational tendons, leading to weakness and excess, which arise from strong desires causing the essence to dissipate. Weakness is also caused by unfulfilled desires harming the liver, compounded by excessive intimacy.]</p>
<p>The Yangming is the sea of the five organs and six bowels, primarily governing the nourishment of the foundational tendons. The foundational tendons are responsible for supporting the bones and facilitating movement.</p>
<p>[Note: Yangming is the sea of the essential energy derived from food and fluids. The five organs and six bowels receive energy from Yangming, thus it is considered the sea of the organs and bowels. The foundational tendons refer to the front channel.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The front yin is where the ancestral sinews gather, where the Taiyin and Yangming converge. All sinews belong to the joints, primarily binding the bones and facilitating movement. The ancestral sinew is the meeting point of all sinews, and the blood and qi produced by Yangming nourish it; thus, all forms of atrophy exclusively arise from Yangming. </p>
<p>The Chong Vessel is the sea of meridians, responsible for nourishing the valleys and connecting with Yangming at the ancestral sinew. </p>
<p>(Note: The Chong Vessel originates within the womb, ascending along the back to become the sea of meridians. Its superficial aspects nourish the valleys, connecting with Yangming at the ancestral sinew. Therefore, if the eunuch sustains injury to the ancestral sinew, it harms the Chong and Ren vessels, resulting in uncontrolled bleeding and the absence of progeny.) </p>
<p>The totality of yin and yang converges at the ancestral sinew, which meets at the qi street, with Yangming as its leader. </p>
<p>(Note: The Shaoyin, Taiyin, Yangming, Chong, Ren, and Du vessels all converge at the ancestral sinew, traveling upwards through the abdomen and meeting again at the qi street. The qi street is the channel for abdominal qi, located between the left and right arteries of the Chong Vessel at the navel, thus Yangming holds dominion over it.) </p>
<p>Hence, if Yangming is deficient, the ancestral sinew becomes loose. </p>
<p>(Note: Yangming is the sea of food and drink, primarily nourishing the ancestral sinew. If Yangming is deficient, the ancestral sinew loosens; if it becomes slack, it cannot bind the bones or facilitate movement, leading to atrophy. Therefore, all forms of atrophy exclusively arise from Yangming.) </p>
<p>Thus, if Yangming is deficient, the ancestral sinew becomes loose.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Notes: The Yangming channel corresponds to the sea of food and water, governing the nourishment of the tendons and muscles. If the Yangming is deficient, the tendons and muscles may be slack, unable to support the bones and facilitate movement, leading to atrophy and paralysis. Therefore, all forms of atrophy primarily concern the Yangming.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the condition of the Anterior Yin:</strong> The Anterior Yin is where the tendons converge, and it is the convergence point of the Taiyin and Yangming. <strong>Notes: The root of the tendons originates in the womb, internally connecting to the kidneys. The yin and yang energies are produced in the stomach and intestines, transmitted to the Taiyin, and stored in the kidneys. The convergence of the Taiyin and Yangming in the tendons is where the middle jiao&#39;s Taiyin and Yangming aligns with the lower jiao&#39;s Shaoyin and Taiyang, meeting at the Anterior Yin.</strong> In cases of sudden onset (jueyin) conditions, there will be swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distension, difficulty in urination, a preference for lying down with knees bent, and contraction and swelling due to internal heat. <strong>Notes: The pulse of the Jueyin pathway reaches the lower abdomen, connecting with the stomach associated with the liver&#39;s network of the gallbladder, thus causing swelling and pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal distension. The pathway descends along the inner thigh, entering the hair follicles, encircling the genitalia, and reaching the lower abdomen, leading to urinary difficulties and contraction with swelling. The liver governs the tendons, and the knees are the meeting point of the tendons. When the channels are reversed, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, hence the preference for lying down with bent knees. The pulse begins near the hairline at the great toe, travels up along the ankle, and the Jueyin wood and fire dominate qi, which causes internal swelling and heat.</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>On the True Nature of the Jade Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>Wind is the chief of all diseases. If left untreated, it affects the spleen and transmits to the kidneys, causing a condition known as hernia or lump, characterized by pain and heat in the lower abdomen, and leading to a discharge of a whitish fluid, also called &quot;gu.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>On the Hollow Bones</strong></p>
<p>When the Ren meridian is diseased, men suffer from internal accumulations of seven types of hernia, and women face issues of discharge and lump formations. The seven hernias manifest differently and have distinct names. The term &quot;lump&quot; refers to the presence of fluid posing as blood, while &quot;accumulation&quot; signifies a stagnation of qi that leads to a buildup. The blood and qi of the Chong vessel disperse into the external environment, hence the retrograde qi results in urgency within. </p>
<h2>Diseases originating from the Governor vessel arise when they surge from the lower abdomen up to the heart, resulting in pain that cannot be relieved at the front or back, known as counterflow hernia. The vessel travels straight up from the lower abdomen, thus causing heart pain, and it entangles around the front and back in the space of the two lower yin organs, preventing relief from the pain and forming a counterflow hernia.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Discussion on the Four Seasons of Counter-Flow</strong></p>
<p>When Yan Yin (the cold) is excessive, it causes diseases related to the liver and hernias of the fox. When Shao Yin is excessive, it causes diseases related to the lungs and hernias. When Tai Yin is excessive, it causes diseases related to the spleen and hernias. When Yang Ming is excessive, it causes diseases related to the heart and hernias. When Tai Yang is excessive, it causes diseases related to the kidneys and hernias. When Shao Yang is excessive, it causes diseases related to the liver and hernias.<br><strong>[Note: The term &quot;excessive&quot; refers to a condition of abundant Yang Qi with some heat-related illness. An abundance of hernia Qi leading to heat results in hernia pain. The term &quot;wind&quot; refers to conditions produced by this heat.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on the Essentials of Ultimate Truth</strong></p>
<p>When Tai Yang is in the Spring, cold dampness prevails, resulting in people suffering from pain in the lower abdomen and testicles, drawing pain in the back and spine, leading to heart pain, with blood causing throat pain and swelling in the jaws.<br><strong>[Note: In the Year of the Ox, when Tai Yang is in the Spring and cold dampness is present, the bladder and kidneys are affected. The bladder is located in the lower abdomen, causing pain there. The kidneys govern the lower organs, hence the pulling sensation in the testicles. The Tai Yang vessels connect the spine to the lower back and heart, causing back and spine pain. The kidney vessels are linked to the heart, resulting in heart pain as cold pressures the blood, leading to throat pain and jaw swelling, reflecting a small intestine channel issue. The small intestine serves as the &quot;fu&quot; (viscera) for the heart, also indicating that water pathogenic factors are overpowering the heart&#39;s fire.)</strong> Tai Yang&#39;s recovery leads to lower abdominal pain and testicle pulling, which affects the lower back and results in heart pain.<br><strong>[Note: This is also indicative of a condition from Yan Yin.]</strong><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The triumph of Yangming arises from clarity within. Pain in the left flank leads to diarrhea, causing an internal blockage in the throat, while externally manifesting as hernias, resulting in discomfort in the chest, a blocked throat, and coughing.</p>
<p>[Note: The coldness of metal manifests from within due to its dominance; thus, the wood energy suffers, leading to flank pain and hernias.] </p>
<p>In relation to the Taiyin, when it dominates, cold energy reverses and fills up, making it difficult to consume food and drink, potentially resulting in hernias.</p>
<p>[Note: The dominance leads to a reverse of cold energy filled when water overflows and climbs upon earth. The guest energy of the four corresponds to the wind and wood of Jueyin, causing difficulty in consuming food and drink. If severe, it results in hernias due to dampness rising and affecting the Jueyin meridian.]<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Five Constant Virtues and Governance</h3>
<p>The moon governs the sky; dampness descends while kidney energy rises. When the chest is not in harmony, there occurs impotence, with energy greatly diminished and unresponsive.<br>(Note: The disharmony in the chest refers to the upward counterflow of water and energy. Impotence arises when kidney energy is weak below. Yang energy is produced from the kidney&#39;s yin and operates on the skin&#39;s surface. Therefore, with greatly weakened kidney energy, the reproductive organs become unresponsive.)</p>
<h3>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</h3>
<h4>Section on Pathogenic Influences and Organ Disease</h4>
<p>The liver channel shows a slight swelling indicating liver obstruction, leading to retraction of yin; if it is excessive, it results in a hernia.<br>(Note: Swelling indicates excess liver energy. The retraction and hernia imply stagnation of liver energy below.) The heart channel shows a slight sliding quality, indicative of heart hernia involving the navel, causing rumbling in the lower abdomen. </p>
<p>The spleen channel shows slight swelling indicating hernia energy; if it is excessive, it leads to urinary retention, with severe cases involving internal hernia, resulting in the discharge of pus and blood.<br>(Note: The spleen is the damp and earthy element. Excess damp-heat leads to hernia. If deficient and cold, it causes internal issues. The spleen has abundant blood but deficient energy, leading to discharge of pus and blood.) The kidney channel, if overly sliding, indicates urinary retention; if excessively large, it signifies impotence.<br>(Note: Heat in the kidney leads to swelling of the testicles. Impotence refers to the inability of the reproductive organs to function.)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Channel Theory</h3>
<p>The Liver channel of the Foot Jueyin, when it is in motion, leads to low back pain making it difficult to bend or stretch, causes hernias in men, and swelling in the lower abdomen of women; it is primarily responsible for diseases arising from the liver, such as fox hernia. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The difficulty in bending or stretching due to low back pain arises because the Jueyin is transformed from the energy of the Shaoyang, indicating a disease of the Jueyin&#39;s Qi.

<p>When the energy of the Foot Jueyin is exhausted, the tendons are severed. The Jueyin corresponds to the Liver channel. The Liver is the convergence of tendons. The tendons are concentrated in the genitals and interlinked at the root of the tongue. Thus, if the pulse does not thrive, the tendons become tense; if the tendons are tense, they pull on the tongue and the eggs. Therefore, if the lips are blue and the tongue is curled while the eggs shrink, it indicates that the tendons are the first to deteriorate. When Geng and Du are deceased, metal overcomes wood. </p>

<h3>Posture of the Jing-Jin</h3>
<p>The ailments of the hand&#39;s Shaoyin Jing-Jin manifest differently with cold and heat. In cold, the tendons retract and are tight; in heat, the tendons relax and do not contract, which leads to impotence. When yang is urgent, the tendons retract; when yin is urgent, they cannot extend. The treatment involves needling to counteract the urgent cold. In heat, the tendons do not retract; thus, there is no need for cauterization, referred to as the &quot;winter obstruction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ailments of the hand&#39;s Shaoyin relate to qi and manifest as Jing-Jin diseases. Cold causes retraction and tightness; heat causes relaxation. When yang is urgent, there is retraction; when yin is urgent, it cannot extend. The essence of Shaoyin is yin, thus marked by yang; hence, there are symptoms of cold, heat, yin, and yang. Shaoyin governs qi and is hence tied to the winter obstruction.</p>
<p>The Jing of the foot’s Jueyin begins above the big toe, follows the inner thigh, and connects to the genitalia, interlacing with various tendons. Its ailment is manifested as impotence. When harmed internally, it does not function; with cold injury, it retracts; with heat, it extends without contraction. The treatment lies in regulating water to clear the yin qi.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The genitalia are the focal point of the tendons, thus connecting with the three yin and three yang tendons. The ailment causes impotence. Internal harm results in impotence; cold injury leads to retraction; heat results in extension without contraction. The Jueyin is seen through the fire transformation of Shaoyang, hence the distinction between cold and heat. Therefore, treat under the influence of metal qi with water qi. Further treatment involves the wood qi. The wood qi of Jueyin originates from water, hence treatment focuses on water to clear the Jueyin qi.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Tastes</strong></p>
<p>Yin is where the tendons accumulate. Therefore, sour enters and moves the tendons. 【Note: Yin refers to the front yin. The accumulation of tendons refers to the primary tendon. The primary tendon governs the tendons. Since sour enters the primary tendon, it moves the tendons. This pertains to the foot Jueyin liver channel, which governs the primary tendon and connects with the tendons of the whole body.】<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>Five Sounds and Five Tastes</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: If a scholar is injured in the yin, and the yin energy is exhausted and cannot rise, yet the beard does not fall, what is the reason? Why do eunuchs specifically suffer this? I wish to hear the reason. Qibo said: Eunuchs sever their fundamental tendons, injure their collaterals, resulting in blood loss that does not recover, their skin internally congeals, and their lips and mouth lack luster, hence the beard does not grow. </p>
<p><em>Note: Eunuchs sever their fundamental tendons and damage their collaterals, leading to blood loss that does not replenish, thus their lips and mouth lose their vitality, preventing beard growth. This is due to the cutting away of the anterior yin and the injury to their innate essence.</em></p>
<p>An eunuch of heaven is what heaven lacks. Their channel of penetration is not robust, their fundamental tendons are incomplete, with energy but no blood, and their lips and mouth lack luster, hence the beard does not grow.</p>
<p><em>Note: A heavenly eunuch refers to a celestial castrate. The absence of an anterior yin means it is present but reduced, neither protruding nor elongated, unable to father children, which signifies a deficiency in what is innately provided. Their channel of penetration is weak, their fundamental tendons incomplete, with energy but no blood, and their lips and mouth lack luster, thus the beard does not grow.</em></p>

<p><strong>On Dampness and Swelling</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is troubled, the body feels heavy and lacks energy, making it hard to lie down, resulting in restlessness and agitation; this person experiences swelling. When kidney water accumulates, the abdomen becomes large, the navel swells, there is pain in the waist, inability to urinate, and dampness in the lower regions like sweat on a cow’s nose; the feet feel abnormally cold, while the face appears lean.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Yin Blowing</strong></p>

<p>Fish without intestines and gallbladder should not be eaten. Consuming it can lead to three years of unresolved yin, causing women to become infertile.</p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Abdominal pain, with a pulse that is taut and tight; the tautness indicates that defensive qi is obstructed, and one feels aversion to cold. The tightness indicates a lack of appetite, a struggle between evil and proper, leading to cold hernia. Cold hernia causes pain around the navel. If it develops, white fluid may ooze out, and the hands and feet will feel cold. If the pulse is deep and tight, major aconite decoction is indicated. Cold hernia leading to abdominal pain and side pain with urgency is treated with angelica, ginger, and lamb soup. For cold hernia with abdominal pain, counterflow of cold, and numbness in hands and feet, if there is body pain and moxibustion or acupuncture cannot treat it, the aconite and cinnamon twig decoction should be used. </p>
<p>If the pulse is rapid and tight, resembling a bowstring, and does not change when pressed, it indicates the need to expel cold. A rapid and taut pulse suggests the cold needs to be expelled. A large and tight pulse indicates a firm heart area. A large and tight pulse also suggests the presence of yin amidst yang, which can be expelled. The foot yang pulse should be depressed, but if it is instead taut, it must indicate existing cold hernia and abdominal pain; if treated by expelling downward, it will cause fullness in the chest and shortness of breath. </p>
<p>In cases of yin fox hernia gas, it may vary in size, rising and falling from time to time; spiderwort powder is indicated.</p>

There are also those afflicted with jealousy sores, to be treated with the jealousy sore prescription. Jealousy sores occur for men at the head of the penis and for women inside the vaginal door, resembling canker sores. Eating certain foods leads to great pain, but canker sores do not cause pain. The pulse in the falling yang is slippery and rapid, thus should be treated with heavier measures. The minor yin pulse is slippery and rapid, indicating sores forming in the woman’s genitals.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>The Book of Living (Huo Ren Shu) by Zhu Hong (Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contraction of the Sac</strong></p>
<p>After seven days of severe cold damage, if the abdomen is full and contracted, the pulse is both thin and weak; this indicates that the foot Jueyin Liver Meridian is affected. If the pulse is floating and weak, the abdomen will not contract, and there will be external signs of fever and chills, similar to malaria. To recover, one should use a decoction of equal parts Guizhi and Mahuang. If the pulses are both deep and short, this indicates contraction of the abdomen, with toxic qi entering the organs; one should use Chengqi Decoction to purge it.</p>
<p>Generally, in cases of severe cold damage, the transmission of disease occurs first in the yang organs, and then sequentially moves into the yin organs. Since yang governs life, the Taiyang water transmits to the Foot Yangming earth, which then transmits to the Foot Shaoyang wood as a slight pathogenic factor. Yin governs death, so wood transmits to the Foot Taiyin earth, which then transmits to the Foot Shaoyin water, and water transmits to the Foot Jueyin wood. By the sixth or seventh day, if it has transmitted to the Jueyin Liver wood, it must transfer qi to invade the Spleen earth. If the Spleen is repeatedly subjected to the invading evil, then all five organs and six viscera will be burdened and perilous. </p>
<p>When the Ying and wei (nutritive and defensive) energies are obstructed, the ears may become deaf and the abdomen may contract, resulting in being unaware and leading to death. Prompt use of Chengqi Decoction can secure the possibility of saving one out of five lives. The ancients said: &quot;In cases of Spleen heat disease, the five organs become precarious.&quot; They also said: &quot;When earth fails and wood invades, it results in death.&quot; If by the sixth or seventh day it transmits to Jueyin and the pulse is slightly weak and slightly floating, this indicates the Spleen and Stomach pulse is intact, knowing that the Spleen qi is complete and no longer accepts the guest, the evil has no place to reside; the extreme will turn into the favorable, the Ying and wei will recover, water will rise and fire will descend, leading to the occurrence of cold and heat, and a great sweat will resolve the condition.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Ji Sheng Fang</strong><br><strong>Song Dynasty - Yan Yonghe</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Seven Hernias</strong>  </p>
<p>Chao Shi says: A hernia is painful and is caused by weakness of the vital and protective energies. An imbalance in diet, whether too cold or too warm, leads to the invasion of cold and evil qi, which enter the abdomen and result in various hernias. When it occurs, there is pain in the lower abdomen, which may circle around the navel or rise to the heart, causing heart and back pain. In severe cases, there may be cold limbs, spontaneous sweating, nausea, and difficulty in bowel movements. Generally, the pulse associated with hernias is taut and tight, indicative of cold and pain. There are seven types of hernias: knot hernia, symptom hernia, cold hernia, qi hernia, disk hernia, attaching hernia, and wolf hernia. How do we define them? Knot hernia presents as heart pain with cold feet and vomiting after eating; symptom hernia is characterized by sudden fullness in the abdomen with gas accumulation like an arm; cold hernia occurs due to cold food and drink, resulting in sudden pain in the abdomen; qi hernia features intermittent fullness and pain in the abdomen; disk hernia causes pain in the abdomen that radiates to the sides of the navel; attaching hernia has pain in the abdomen linked to below the navel with accumulation; wolf hernia causes pain in the lower abdomen connected to the genital area. If hernias do not heal, evil qi remains trapped, leading to accumulation. As for this disease, whether on the left or right side, there may be a sensation like a cup covering the area, or fullness above and below the navel like an arm, or abdominal distension resembling a plate, resulting in emaciation and shortness of breath, chills, alternating cold and heat, a preference for lying down, and ineffective food intake or abdominal fullness with vomiting and diarrhea, with pain triggered by cold. The pulse is constricted and tight, floating and firm, indicative of accumulation. However, a strong and urgent pulse indicates life, while a weak and urgent pulse is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The symptoms of Yin (Tui) can be classified into four types: the first is intestinal (Tui), the second is Qi (Tui), the third is swelling of the eggs, and the fourth is water (Tui). The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states: the kidney Qi is deficient, invaded by wind and cold, flowing into the kidneys, unable to disperse, leading to this condition. The &quot;Sanyin&quot; indicates that Yin (Tui) is associated with the liver and connects with the tendons, while the stomach&#39;s Yangming nourishes it. In reviewing numerous texts, they all affirm this view. Many cases arise from poor personal hygiene, excessive sexual activity, prolonged accumulation of emotions such as worry, fear, and anger, sitting or lying in cold and damp places, or overexertion without moderation; all these can lead to this condition. When ill, symptoms include swelling of the egg and cysts, which may vary in size, may be hard as stone, or cause twisting pain in the abdomen; in severe cases, there may be skin abscesses or swelling, leading to sores and toxic conditions. If mild, clear fluid may appear intermittently; in severe cases, there may be festering and decay. Generally speaking, swelling of the eggs and intestinal (Tui) conditions are difficult to treat, while Qi (Tui) and water (Tui) are easier to heal with moxibustion. Additionally, there are cases where children have had this condition since birth, which indicates a chronic illness. The treatment method for the fourth type involves the use of Juzi kernel pills, which have proven effective repeatedly.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Kidney Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition occurs in older individuals with a history of hernias, or in those affected by cold and dampness, due to overexertion; in younger people, it often results from sexual activity. Initially, there is redness and swelling of the scrotum, accompanied by chills and fever. Pain intensifies in the water passage and the two lower orifices, making it unbearable. When pressed, the skin feels loose and does not tighten. One can apply a remedy to dispel toxins, such as a mixture of Radix Angelicae Sinensis and Fructus Meliae, for dispersal. If pressing the area feels like fire and there is acute swelling, one must urgently use medications for scrotal toxicity and take lead sulfate pills. </p>
<p>If surgery is necessary, it must wait until the abscess is mature. One should tie off the kidney with an oiled thread and incision at the lowest point; this will allow pus and blood to drain completely. An external application of medicated plasters, such as Jin Si, is recommended. It is advisable to minimize physical labor, avoid sexual activity, and stay away from hot, humid environments and various toxic substances.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Toxic Scrotum (i.e., External Kidney Abscess)</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from the stagnation of damp-heat in the liver channel, which then flows toxins into the bladder and kidney channels. Exposure to cold and heat pathogens, particularly affecting the yin meridians, leads to the coagulation of blood and qi. Cold and dampness do not disperse, resulting in swelling and pain of the scrotum, or even ulceration and skin peeling, with the testicles hanging low. It is advisable to use a cooling liver disharmonization soup for internal consumption and apply Tie Gu San externally. If there is decay, urgently apply Wu Jin San. If ulceration occurs, with reduced appetite and thoughts of food, afternoon fevers may arise; quickly take an enhanced version of Xiao Chai Hu Tang. For severe pain, add Huang Lian; for difficulty in urination, add Mu Tong and Che Qian Zi; for thirst, add Tian Hua Fen, Mai Men Dong, and Wu Wei Zi.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Erosion Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of yin erosion ulcers is due to internal organ weakness, diminished kidney qi, and the invasion of wind pathogens affecting the bowels. These toxins harm the defensive and nourishing aspects, or result from unclean contact with toxic women. Symptoms include intermittent pain and itching, gradually resulting in the formation of sores that discharge pus. If not treated promptly, life may be endangered. First, use She Chuang Zi, Di Gu Pi, and Sang Huai branches to make a warming wash. Internally, consume a clearing heat and detoxifying soup, and use medicinal powders externally. Initially apply Jin Si Gao, followed by Zi Jin Gao to draw out the toxic fluid and promote flesh regrowth. Yin erosion ulcers are indeed the same as lower sores. They may emit a foul odor, which is why the base of the shaft develops sores. These are associated with the liver channel’s territories. For both internal and external erosion sores, with body heat and slow urination, it is advisable to take Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Long Dan Cao, Huang Lian, and Che Qian Zi.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Poison in the Lower Body (also known as Blood Hernia)</strong></p>
<p>The condition of poison is located between the legs in the lower abdomen. It may arise from long journeys causing fatigue, from straining while standing or bending, from injuries during intimate relations, or from excessive desire between men and women, leading to an inability to fulfill one&#39;s wishes and resulting in the stagnation of essence and blood. This can also happen from not releasing it in dreams, or from unending thoughts and emotions, thus forming poison. The kidneys are the organs of strength and creativity; when stimulated, essence and blood can stagnate, leading to this condition. Initially, symptoms may present as alternating chills and fever, with tension in the legs and swelling that prevents movement, indicating the progression of the ailment. It is urgent to take Long Dan Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Small Intestine Flow Poison</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from retained heat in the heart, which accumulates into poison. It is advisable to use the Anti-Poison and Flow Qi Decoction, followed by the Clear Heart and Flow Qi Decoction for treatment, and to regularly take the Chinese Alum Pill.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Hedong Six Writings by Liu Wansuo (Jin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Nèituó) Hernia</strong></p>
<p>(Nèituó) hernia refers to the condition of the lower abdomen where there is swelling and acute cramping pain. Cold causes contraction, and when cold reaches its extreme, it transforms into a condition that can be treated with earth, hence causing swelling. The texts say that in men, (nèituó) hernia manifests as acute pain in the lower abdomen associated with the genitals. In women, swelling in the lower abdomen is due to diseases of the liver channel. The classic commentary states that hernia is caused by the accumulation of cold. Additionally, according to the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; all five organs can have hernias, but these are characterized by a rapid pulse. It is noted that a rapid pulse indicates a sign of cold. However, cold should lead to a short, small, and slow pulse; thus, the term &quot;rapid&quot; here does not mean fast and numerous but rather indicates fullness. A tense pulse indicates severe pain, and although cold may be present, it is characterized by a short and small pulse. Therefore, in cases of pain with a tense and rapid pulse, the pulse reflects nourishment from the heart. Whenever there are six qi (elements) involved in the pain, the heart and spirit are unsettled, and the tension cannot relax, leading to observable pulse changes. To understand which qi causes the pain, one must consider the pulse that combines tightness and rapidity. If the pulse is tight and rapid, it indicates heat-related pain. The classic also states that the spleen transmits to the kidneys, with the condition referred to as hernia and masses, characterized by discomfort and pain in the lower abdomen, producing white fluid, hence the name &quot;gu.&quot; The commentary notes that pain in the lower abdomen can lead to white fluid excretion. One interpretation states that internal heat can become constipated, causing the loss of fat like a worm consuming it, hence the name &quot;gu.&quot; However, since the texts repeatedly identify heat as a potential cause of hernia and masses, it should not be assumed to be solely due to cold; differentiation must be made based on pulse and symptoms.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p>
<h3>Small Intestine Qi</h3>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: When small intestine disease is lodged in the waist, it rises without descending, causing pain that affects the heart and lungs. The main treatment is the Fennel and Melia fruit pills.</p>
<h3>Yin Hernia</h3>
<p>The pulse of the Foot Jueyin circulates around the reproductive organs and reaches the lower abdomen. If there is swelling or pain, it indicates cold and deficiency of the kidneys and drying up of fluids. The treatment should involve expelling the evil and nourishing the pulse, with the main prescription being the Jizhi Decoction.</p>
<h3>Gu Hernia</h3>
<p>Spleen wind transmits to the kidneys, also known as hernia qi. This results in lower abdominal pain and discharge of white fluid, termed Gu. The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; states that when one loses their ambition, it is referred to as Gu disease, which indicates that vital essence is not being conserved. The primary treatment is the Da Jianzhong Decoction.</p>
<h3>Heart Hernia</h3>
<p>When the heart pulse is urgent and there is a tangible presence in the lower abdomen, while the heart itself is not affected by evil, it must be transmitted to the bowels. Thus, the physical manifestation in the lower abdomen occurs, and if the heart qi is disrupted and has reversed flow, the pain persists. Treatment should also address heart qi. If it continues, it is due to invasion by cold evil. The primary prescription is the Mu Xiang San.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p>
<h3>The Confucian Way of Filial Piety 【Yuan　Zhang Congzheng】</h3>
<h4>Pain in the Stalk</h4>
<p>For pain in the stalk, it is advisable first to use clearing and cold remedies to dispel it, and then to apply mild and sweet remedies to differentiate it.</p>
<h4>On Hernias, Which Are Fundamental to the Liver Meridian</h4>
<p>There are seven types of hernia; many have discussed them, but I do not accept the views that are not from the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; &quot;Suwen,&quot; or &quot;Copper Man.&quot; It is not that I favor unusual opinions, but I simply wish to uncover the source. What are the seven hernias? They are cold hernia, water hernia, tendon hernia, blood hernia, air hernia, fox hernia, and (sick exhaustion) hernia, which are known as the seven hernias. Common practitioners do not recognize these, thus they create erroneous names. Some say it is the bladder, others say it is cold in the kidneys, or that it is gas in the small intestine; children call it irregular gas. Such misnamed conditions lead to losing the essence of the issue. Why is this? It is because physicians mistakenly classify it as bladder, kidney, or small intestine gas, and also claim it is caused by deficiency and cold. The remedies used are often either deer antler or Ba Jiao, or they switch to Du Zhong and Cong Rong; instead of Fu Zi or Wu Tou, they may use dried ginger or cinnamon; and instead of Huang Lian or Ling Xiang, they might opt for Jin Ling or Bu Gu Zhi. Morning and evening they take these with no significant effect. Over three to twenty years, it remains firmly entrenched. Occasionally, when minor illness occurs, it may seem to alleviate slightly. Holding onto this slight improvement leads to a major misconception. If the marked issue is not resolved, it will inevitably return with greater severity. Tales of this spread everywhere, with no one aware of the truth. Little do they know that all hernias are related to the liver meridian, whose flow ultimately leads to the small intestine and its pouch. The bladder, being a water organ, is responsible for drainage; the small intestine, as a water channel, governs flow; and the kidneys, being associated with the lesser yin, oversee both types of water.<br><a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The small urine of a person enters the small intestine from the stomach and seeps into the bladder. The bladder is a sac for liquid; when it transforms, water exits from the tip, which is the common principle. When it forms a hernia, it belongs to the liver channel of the foot (Jueyin). This channel circles around the genital area and enters the lower abdomen. Both the liver and kidneys are associated with the lower parts, connecting with the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels. Yet, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that diseases of the liver channel of the foot can lead to incontinence, urinary obstruction, and hernia. It specifically governs the kidney, bladder, and small intestine channels, thus not mentioning hernia, indicating that the site of hernia is part of the liver. Furthermore, the &quot;Neijing&quot; states that in men, the zong muscle is the meeting of the bones. The liver primarily governs muscles. The testicle is the orb within the sac. Although it primarily governs the external kidney, if not guided by the Jueyin channel, the jade stem cannot expand or contract. In women, it is the genital opening, with inner and outer parts: one is called the ting hole and the other is the yao leak. These are where the foot Jueyin meets the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that the channel of the foot Jueyin converges at the genital area. If it is injured by cold, it retracts; if injured by heat, it protrudes without control. The treatment lies in promoting water to clear the yin Qi. Therefore, the channels of Yangming, Taiyin, and Jueyin all converge at the genital area. Only the Jueyin governs the muscles, thus if a hernia occurs, it must originate from the Jueyin.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The “Lingshu” also states: The differentiation of the foot Jueyin is called Li Gou, located five cun above the inner ankle. It branches off to travel to Shaoyang, following the leg up to the testicles, and connects at the root. When pathogenic qi reverses, it causes testicular swelling and sudden hernias; if it is full, it is elongated, and if it is deficient, it causes severe itching—this is the place where it branches off. Is it not true that Jueyin is the location affected by illness?</p>
<p>The “Lingshu” further states: When the evil is in the small intestine, it is connected to the testicular system, belongs to the kidney, and penetrates through the liver&#39;s network to the lung. The heart is linked to abundant qi, which rises and clashes upward; the intestines and stomach disturb the liver, scattered in the diaphragm and settled at the navel. Therefore, we approach the diaphragm to disperse it, address the Taiyin to pacify it, utilize areas below Jueyin, and apply pressure on Ju Xu and Xia Lian to eliminate it, adjusting according to the meridians it passes through.</p>
<p>Though it initially states the evil is in the small intestine, in the treatment method, it must mention focusing on areas below Jueyin, thus knowing that all hernias relate to Jueyin, inevitably. Consulting the pulse, the “Suwen” mentions that Jueyin slippery indicates fox wind hernias, Shaoyang slippery indicates lung wind hernias, Taiyin slippery indicates spleen wind hernias, Yangming slippery indicates heart wind hernias, Taiyang slippery indicates kidney wind hernias, and Shaoyin slippery indicates liver wind hernias. All six hernias, even if seen in other pulses, are said to be wind hernias of the foot Jueyin liver meridian.</p>
<p>The “Lingshu” also states that a slightly slippery heart pulse indicates heart hernia, a very slippery liver pulse signifies (zang gui) hernia, and a very slippery kidney pulse indicates (zang gui). All these three organ hernias are also characterized by slippage as a sign of hernia.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; also states that a large, rapid pulse indicates hernia. A slippery heart pulse is indicative of heart hernia. A deep lung pulse suggests lung hernia. Rapid pulses in the three Yin indicate hernia, while rapid pulses in the three Yang indicate masses (jias). Wang Taifu said, when the Taiyang experiences cold, blood congeals to form a mass; when the Taiyin experiences cold, qi gathers to form a hernia. It is said that when the Taiyin is affected by cold, it transmits to the liver channel, which can be treated with warming herbs to expel it, but not with nourishing herbs. If one dares to nourish it, it is akin to wanting the illness to leave yet forcefully keeping it. Upon examining &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; it becomes clear that the three Yang diseases manifest as cold and heat, leading to hernia. This indicates that the bladder is not the site of the disease but rather transmits to the Jueyin area, resulting in hernia. Furthermore, it states that if the disease is located in the lower abdomen, causing abdominal pain and inability to urinate or defecate, it is termed hernia, resulting from cold. When the pulse is rapid, it indicates hernia and mass, along with pain in the lower abdomen. When referring to the lower abdomen, is it not the Jueyin region? It is also stated that spleen wind transmits to the stomach, referred to as hernia or mass, suggesting that the liver wood cannot generate wind qi. This is termed Jue hernia, as the spleen earth is deficient and cannot control water, being further weakened by the liver wood. It is also mentioned that the governing vessel corresponds to the chong hernia, as Jueyin intersects with the chong, ren, and governing vessels in the front yin. Is this not clear? As for the movements of qi, it is mentioned that during the year when the Taiyang descends into the springs, cold prevails, causing the people to suffer from pain in the lower abdomen and groin. This occurs because cold invades the small intestine and bladder, causing the liver wood to shrink and become unable to extend; this is the mother transmitting to the child.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Yangming governs the heavens; dryness overcomes the excessive moisture, causing men to suffer from testicular hernias and women from lower abdominal pain. This indicates that liver qi cannot ascend and is suppressed by metal, hence the affliction. Additionally, when the Taiyin is at the spring and the earth prevails, cold qi reverses and fills, leading to inability to digest food and drink, which can severely result in hernias. This reflects the cold invading the Taiyin&#39;s damp earth, causing the earth to be unable to overcome water, which impacts the liver meridian. </p>
<p>I have also extensively reviewed the &quot;Copper Man&quot; and the associated points, which reflect outward and inward relations. For example, at the back, the thirteen Shu points indicate cold hernia affecting the liver meridian. In the abdominal region, the Yin Jiao point is noted for cold hernia, being an expression of the Ren meridian; the Guan Yuan point indicates sudden hernia, associated with the small intestine&#39;s reserve and the convergence of the three Yin meridians; the Zhong Ji point refers to hernia and masses, being the reserve of the bladder and also the convergence of the three Yin meridians; and the Qu Gu point relates to hernia and is associated with both the Ren meridian and the Foot Jueyin. </p>
<p>In the second abdominal segment, the Huang Shu points denote cold hernia, being the convergence of the Chong and Foot Shaoyin; the Si Man points reflect hernia and masses, relating to the Chong and Ren meridians and the Foot Shaoyin kidney. In the third abdominal segment, the Da Ju points refer to hernia, arising from the energy of the Foot Yangming meridian; the Qi Chong points indicate testicular hernia, with pain in the scrotum and cold pain in the two testicles, also arising from the energy of the Foot Yangming meridian.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>In the fourth row of the abdomen, the two points of the palace mention hernia pain, where the foot Taiyin, Jueyin, and Yinwei converge; the two points of Chongmen mention the Yin hernia, where the foot Taiyin and Jueyin meet. For those on the side of the ribs, the two points of Wushu mention cold hernia, where Yin evil rises into the lower abdomen, three inches below the Dai vessel. In the six channels of the foot, the ten points of the foot Jueyin mention hernia seven times, namely Dadu, Xingjian, Taichong, Zhongfeng, Ligou, Zhongdu, and Qusuan. The fourteen points of the foot Shaoyang mention hernia once, specifically Qiusu point. The eleven points of the foot Taiyin mention hernia once, namely Yinlingquan. The fifteen points of the foot Yangming mention hernia once, specifically Yinshi point. The ten points of the foot Shaoyin mention hernia five times, namely Rangu, Taixi, Zhaohai, Jiaoxin, and Zhubin. The eighteen points of the foot Taiyang mention hernia twice, specifically Jindmen and Heyang. Thus, it can be said that only Jueyin mentions hernia frequently, being the main point for hernia. Other meridian points, although they also treat hernia, are ultimately not the locations that receive hernia, but are merely connected to the foot Jueyin. This may be due to cold stagnation in the Qi, wood energy being constricted in this meridian; or due to dryness in the skies, where wood energy is depressed in this meridian; or due to anger, sorrow, and anxiety causing blockages in this meridian; or due to medication externally solidifying, closing the tail and retracting essence, obstructing in this meridian. The conditions of the illness differ in this way.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>In this world, one does not understand the many remedies common folk use. If one trusts common remedies, then the &quot;Suwen,&quot; &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; and &quot;Bronze Man&quot; are not valid; if one trusts the &quot;Suwen,&quot; &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; and &quot;Bronze Man,&quot; then common remedies are not valid either. Alas! I have been in the medical field for over forty years, and through long practice have come to recognize illnesses, thus I am no longer confused. Furthermore, conditions such as dysuria, urinary retention, impotence, and excessive sexual desire are all male ailments—not merely due to cold in the kidneys. If there is blood deficiency and the menstrual cycle does not occur, leading to heat in the lower back and knees, foot cramps, throat dryness, urinary retention, abdominal masses that may be fixed or mobile, protrusion of the front or hemorrhoids at the back, these are all female ailments. Yet, women do not call these conditions hernias; they refer to them as masses. If a young person suffers from these, it matters not whether they are male or female, for they will be without offspring. Such hidden and intricate matters have nothing to do with the bladder, kidneys, or intestines; they are the responsibility of the Liver Channel of the Jueyin. Common remedies only speak of the bladder, kidneys, and intestines, completely neglecting the aspect of Liver Wood, which is profoundly misleading. Moreover, the Liver Channel corresponds to the Wood element, which belongs to the East and is the mother of Heart Fire. In general, hernias arise when Liver Wood is invaded by pathogens, or when the Liver Wood itself becomes excessive; one must not hastily claim deficiency and simply supplement. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that the East is solid, the West is void; one purges the South and supplements the North. This refers to purging fire, balancing Wood, clarifying Metal, and strengthening Water.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>In the past, when Shen Yan was an army officer in Cai, he sat in a damp place and suffered unbearable testicular pain, for which no medicine could provide relief. I hastily administered over thirty doses of water-guiding pills and Yu Gong powder, which quickly alleviated the swelling and reduced the pain. </p>
<p>There was also a man with acute testicular pain who collapsed in the street, and no one could help him. He called for my assistance. I referred to the texts and identified the evil qi residing in the meridian of the foot&#39;s jueyin, which causes sudden testicular pain; hence, I used Yin Wan for the pain. I quickly drained the two acupoints of Dadu, and the severe pain immediately ceased. The Dadu acupoint is indeed one of the two points of the foot&#39;s jueyin.</p>
<p>There was a man in Diao Kou who suffered from a fever with thirst, and his craving for honeyed drinks resulted in extreme injury from ice water. The physicians were unaware that they needed to drain the excess moisture and instead compounded with ginger, causing dampness to be trapped and turning into heat, leading to blockages in the three burners, impaired water pathways, and sluggishness in the reproductive channels, resulting in a swollen scrotum, larger than a ladle. I first administered over a hundred water-guiding pills, and soon after, I used pig kidney powder. That night, he expelled a bucket of dark and light-colored water, and thus the pain at that site was relieved.</p>
<p>Another man had acute testicular pain with pronounced swelling that persisted for several days; all medications acted as if they were thrown into water without effect. I gave him one hundred fifty water-guiding pills for three doses and followed with three qian of Tongjing powder mixed with light wine on an empty stomach. By dawn, he expelled numerous clotted substances from his internal organs, and all pain and swelling disappeared, returning to normal within three days. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: when the wood is congested, it should be expelled to allow for smooth flow, referring to the requirement to vomit for unblocking. Since the liver accumulates, it should ideally be purged; however, one must consider the nature of the ailment both above and below, with alignment to natural flow being paramount. This aligns with Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s assertion that it is appropriate to induce vomiting for conditions above and purging for those below.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Forms of Hernia Disease</strong></p>
<p>Cold hernia: If it persists without offspring, the bag feels cold, hard like stone; the penis does not erect, and may cause pain when pressing on the testicles. This occurs from sitting or lying on damp ground, wading through cold water during the cold months, being exposed to rain or snow, sitting or lying on bricks or stones, or in cold windy places, causing excessive internal labor. It is advisable to use warming agents to treat it.</p>
<p>Water hernia: It presents as kidney cyst pain, with occasional sweat from the genitals, or the cyst appears crystal-like, or itchy and discharges yellow fluid, or causes a water sound when pressed on the lower abdomen. This arises from excessive drinking after intoxication, internal strain, sweating and exposure to wind, or cold dampness gathering in the cyst, leading to an overload of water resulting in sudden hernia. It is advised to use diuretic agents for treatment. Few know the method to expel water through a leaking needle.</p>
<p>Muscle hernia: Symptoms include swelling of the penis, which may ulcerate or form pus, along with pain that causes deep muscle contractions, or internal pain that is extremely itchy, or persistent and elongated without retraction, with a discharge resembling semen, flowing with urine. This condition arises from sexual exhaustion or external malevolent practices. It is advisable to use soothing agents to treat the heart.</p>
<p>Blood hernia: It feels like a cucumber on both sides of the lower abdomen, roughly at the midpoint of the hip bones, commonly referred to as &quot;benyong.&quot; This occurs due to heavy sensations in spring and summer heat, physical labor causing internal strain, where qi and blood overflow, seeping into the pouch and remaining, forming abscesses, often with pus scarce and blood abundant. It is recommended to use tonifying agents for blood to treat it.</p>
<p>Qi hernia: It presents with connections to the kidney area above and the scrotum below, possibly triggered by crying or anger, causing qi stagnation and swelling; when anger and crying cease, the qi disperses.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>There is a treatment method where one uses needles to release gas for recovery; however, needles have their benefits and drawbacks, so one should also administer medication to disperse the gas. Sometimes children may suffer from this ailment, commonly referred to as &#39;偏气&#39; (side energy), which can arise from a father who is either elderly or a young one who is frequently ill, experiencing issues such as impotence and weak essence. If he forcefully engages in intercourse, it can result in a child, which leads to problems during pregnancy. This hernia, if left untreated, is primarily managed by needling a specific point.</p>
<p>The &#39;fox hernia&#39; resembles a tile: when lying down, it retracts into the lower abdomen, but when standing or walking, it protrudes from the lower abdomen and enters the scrotum. The fox emerges from its den to urinate during the day and retreats into it at night without needing to urinate. This hernia&#39;s entry and exit mimic the behaviors of a fox and have similarities to gas hernias. Nowadays, people use hooked devices for it. It is advisable to administer medication to expel the gas flowing through the channels.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Shan (a type of hernia) presents as a swelling in the scrotum, similar to a rising or falling form; it is neither itchy nor painful. This condition arises from dampness of the earth, hence it frequently occurs in the Jianghuai region, particularly in low, damp areas. It is advisable to treat it with medicines that dispel dampness. In women, a protrusion at the vulva is also similar, but if associated with heat, it cannot be treated by simply reinforcing or drying it. Its proper name is jia, which should be treated with bitter substances to purge and solidify. Wang Bing states: the downward movement of yang energy leads to the upward contention of yin energy; when there is contention above, there is an excess of cold, and when there is descent below, the tendons become lax. Thus, the hanging of the testicles leads to the occurrence of shan. After addressing the condition of the seven types of shan, treatment can be adjusted or supplemented as needed, based on the severity of the illness, without being strictly bound to conventional methods. The classics state that when yin is dominant and there are abdominal distension and obstruction, it is a case of shan repletion, thus it must not be neglected.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Bowel Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bowel abscess refers to a type of hernia in men. It is commonly called bowel abscess because it harms the affected area, hence the name. However, bowel abscess is a misnomer and is not mentioned in the &quot;Nanjing&quot; or &quot;Suwen.&quot; Nonetheless, the pathways of the liver meridian in the foot&#39;s Jueyin govern the circulation of Qi and blood, and the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians are also associated with the liver&#39;s collateral channels. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that men have seven types of hernias, and bowel abscess pertains to blood hernia. It can be treated with Daoshui Pills or Taoren Chengqi Decoction, or by using Diding Decoction to combat stagnant blood that fails to disperse, employing substantial doses for a vigorous purge of one to twenty passages. Subsequently, using Yuzhu Powder to harmonize Qi and blood and open the meridians is advisable. The world only knows the frequent use of Da Huang and Mu Li, and there are cases where recovery does not occur, indicating a lack of knowledge regarding the principles of harmonizing blood and opening the meridians.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Soft Chancre</strong></p>
<p>If a soft chancre does not heal for a long time, it is commonly referred to as a &quot;smelly chancre.&quot; First, lead out the moisture and drain the liver channel; externally apply a powder of patchouli mixed in, a few times daily. Then, consume plain porridge for one to two days until cessation.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Disturbance not Beneficial</strong></p>
<p>The classic states: When the two Yang conditions manifest in the heart and spleen, there is hindered obstruction, and women do not menstruate. Those who interpret this say, for men, the spleen is affected and nourishment does not transform, thus leading to deficiency; for women, the heart is affected and blood does not flow, hence the absence of menstruation. They separate the heart and spleen for men and women, each subject to this interpretation. However, I beg to differ. The two Yang refer to Yangming, connected to the stomach and large intestine. When the intestines and stomach are ill, the heart and spleen are also affected. To say they reach the heart and spleen is merely to express the extent of their influence. Nonetheless, the spleen and stomach are related; thus, a stomach ailment affecting the spleen is justifiable. However, the large intestine and heart are not connected; why do disturbances from the large intestine reach the heart? This is because the stomach is the repository of intake, and the large intestine is responsible for transformation and transportation.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Food ingested into the stomach returns impure energy to the heart, while drink ingested into the stomach is transformed into essence by the spleen; this is due to the stomach&#39;s ability to receive and the large intestine&#39;s ability to transform. When the intestines and stomach are ill, they cannot receive or transform, so what can the heart and spleen rely on? If the heart and spleen have no resources, then there can be no transformation and the generation of essence and blood will cease. Thus, when the intestines and stomach are ill, the heart and spleen suffer, leading to men producing less essence and women not having their menstruation. The heart and spleen should be discussed in general terms for both men and women, and should not be treated differently except in specific conditions like hidden blockages or missed menstruation. If one were to follow the words of the Buddhist, it would imply that a man&#39;s essence relies solely on the spleen and not on the heart, and that a woman&#39;s blood relies solely on the heart and not on the spleen. Is there such reasoning? Indeed, the essence and blood of both men and women are nourished by the interaction of the five organs before they are formed. Can it be said that a man&#39;s essence relies on the spleen and a woman&#39;s blood on the heart? The classics state: both men and women can suffer from heart and spleen ailments. However, in men, this manifests as hidden blockages that are detrimental, while in women, it results in missed menstruation.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The front yin is affected by extreme cold and heat, leading to the descent and shrinkage of the pouch. The theories of Yin and Yang state that when the three Yangs manifest a disease, it brings cold and heat, resulting in obstructed swelling, or causing paralysis of the intestines (hernia). This condition can manifest as a thickening of the pouch and is commonly referred to as hernia. When heat is external and cold is internal, the pouch descends; this corresponds to the energy of late summer. Conversely, when cold is external and heat is internal, the egg contracts; this corresponds to the energy of mid-winter. </p>
<p>The meridian of the foot&#39;s Taiyang bladder ascends, meets the hand&#39;s Taiyang and small intestine meridians, and descends to the foot&#39;s Jueyin liver meridian, where it is unable to extend. If both the Ren and Jueyin meridians are in rebellion, it is like a mighty river, causing Yang energy to fall. This situation results from wind, cold, dampness, and heat escaping from the pouch, leading to the swelling of both testicles, referred to as hernia; if it is severe, it is termed as &quot;tao&quot; (placement). The Jueyin meridian of the foot, along with the cold water pathways of Taiyang and bladder, reaches the end of the front yin. </p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; states: When there is illness in the foot Jueyin liver channel, accompanied by fullness and pouch shrinkage, swift treatment is necessary. A large dose of the Chengqi Decoction is advised to purge great heat.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states in the chapter on the meridians: The foot jueyin liver, when harmed by cold, causes the yin to contract inward. Previously, it was mentioned that the pouch retracts due to great heat; now it is said to be due to great cold. It also states: The pouch retracts, causing testicular atrophy, leading to conditions like hernias and edema, due to excessive cold and wind dampness, with retraction indicative of cold. This differs from the earlier two statements; why? It is because, when discussing a healthy person, in summer the intense heat causes the pouch and testicles to hang down, while in winter the severe cold causes them to retract. This differs again from the previous three statements; why? It is stated that for those suffering from cold damaging the pouch and testicles, the heat is internal and it is appropriate to administer purgative decoctions to urgently relieve it. This aligns with the theory of the pouch retracting inward from external severe cold, also indicating internal heat, consistent with the cold damage theory. Hence, reference to a healthy person is used for verification. In winter, the yang energy is internal and the yin energy is external, corresponding in people; thus, when cold is external, the skin tightens, leading to pouch retraction. In summer, the yin energy is internal and the yang energy is external; thus, when heat is external, the skin relaxes, leading to pouch hanging down, resembling the condition of hernias and edema. Although the three statements are different, they are all based on a single principle.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>On Yin Sores</strong></p>
<p>Yin sores can generally be categorized into three types: the first is damp yin sores; the second is jealousy sores; the third is erosion sores, also known as lower sores. Damp sores are caused by weakness of the kidney channel, where wind and dampness clash, allowing evil qi to take hold, resulting in itchiness and sores with secretions, resembling scabies. Jealousy sores occur when youthful vitality is abundant but overlooked for extended periods, leading to sores on the genitals that are swollen and painful, causing distress and itching. Erosion sores arise from weak kidney energy accompanied by evil forces, with heat accumulating in the lower region, obstructing channels, impeding the flow of qi and blood. Poor hygiene after sexual activity can lead to sores, and if left untreated, they may worsen with severe swelling and internal pain, resulting in difficulty urinating or painful swelling of the genitals. After several days, they may ulcerate, releasing blood and pus, or cause persistent bleeding, culminating in lower sores. If the body shows signs of intense heat, thirst, and aversion to cold, immediate treatment is required. One should soak with a decoction of soybean and licorice, use a poison-cleansing wash, and take blends like five-spice and honeysuckle decoction for relief. Additionally, one can employ a prescription to manage lower sores and apply soothing ointment to the affected areas, followed by careful post-treatment care. For unquenchable thirst, a decoction of bamboo leaves and astragalus is advised. If the stools are soft, one should take a regulating decoction of poria. By following these treatments, recovery is assured.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Manual</strong> [Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p><strong>Hernial Pain</strong></p>
<p>Hernial pain is caused by damp heat and phlegm accumulation flowing downward. Generally, it occurs due to cold obstruction, resulting in phlegm, food accumulation, and stagnant blood. It primarily concerns the liver channel and has no relation to the kidney channel, thus it is not advisable to treat it with downward methods. In cases of severe pain, ginseng and astragalus are not recommended.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>Excessive dampness causes hernias; moxibustion should be applied to the Dadu acupoint, located between the hairs at the base of the toenail of the big toe. For pain caused by food stagnation and dead blood, use gardenia, peach kernels, hawthorn, and bitter orange, along with evodia, all stir-fried with ginger juice, boiled in water, and taken as a decoction. One variation adds fennel and aconite. There are also cases of swelling and pain due to water retention.</p>
<p>For those accompanied by deficiency, ginseng and atractylodes should be the principal ingredients, supported by herbs that promote movement. A deep, tight, and large pulse indicates this. If the pulse is unstable upon palpation, it belongs to deficiency; therefore, it is essential to use a combination of cinnamon twig, fried gardenia, and finely cut and stir-fried aconite, powdered and made into pills with ginger juice. Taking thirty to forty pills followed by ginger broth can significantly alleviate pain. Daisigong stated that hernias fundamentally belong to the Jueyin liver meridian. I often observe that common claims link it to air in the lower parts of the intestine and bladder, which are misconceptions.</p>
<p>The &quot;Wood Kidney&quot; refers to a state where the heart fire descends, allowing the kidney water to remain warm; where the true yang flows down, so kidney energy remains harmonized. When both warm and harmonious, how can there be a strong &quot;Wood&quot;? It is only when excessive desires harm within, causing kidney deficiency and fatigue, that yin and yang fail to interact, and water and fire fail to assist each other. This results in persistent cold, stagnation, swelling, and pain, ultimately leading to stubborn blockage and hardness. It is crucial not to rely solely on dryness and heat; rather, one should warm, disperse, and benefit to expel evil. When the evil qi dissipates internally and the defense and nourishment circulate, it is like the cold valley springing back to life. Indeed, some may recover swiftly without effort, and come to a resolution without movement.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>In treating the seven types of hernias, one often uses warming medicines to achieve efficacy, according to the methods in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; However, it is necessary to supervise the use of cool and cold medicines and not rely solely on very hot substances like Aconite or Prepared Aconite, as prolonged use can lead to severe, untreatable conditions. Instead, it is advisable to use the Erchen Decoction added with Zhiqiao, Juhua seeds, Gardenia, and Hawthorn, boiled in fresh ginger juice and drunk hot. </p>
<p>If there is pain caused by stagnant blood, add Yanhusuo and crushed peach kernels to this formula. If pain is caused by qi, include Mu Xiang, Fennel, and Melia seeds. If the pulse is deep and thin, and the extremities are cold, add substances like Aconite, Dried Ginger, and Cinnamon to assist. </p>
<p>For severe testicular pain, add Lychee seeds, Frankincense, and Myrrh ground into fine powder and mixed in. This formula can be taken as a decoction or mixed with warm water. If the kidney is swollen to the size of a bowl, remove licorice from the formula and add Seaweed, Kelp, Lychee seeds, Fennel, and Melia seeds, grinding them into powder, which can be taken with warm water or made into pills.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Abscess in the Sac</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: If an abscess enters the sac, it leads to death. The sac is associated with the Jue Yin (Liver) pathway; if we interpret &quot;death&quot; in this context, does it imply an evil associated with the Shao Yin (Kidney) channel? I have personally witnessed seven or eight cases where the abscess entered the sac, all of which were treated for damp-heat affecting the Liver channel, supplemented with nourishing Yin herbs. Although pus ruptured and the skin fell off, and while the testicles hung down ominously, none of them died. However, I wonder how it is with the elderly or those with chronic deficiencies? An abscess in the sac indicates damp-heat descending. In cases where there is pus, this signifies that dirty qi is moistening downwards and may flow into the urethra, often due to deficiency of the yin passage or obstruction of the urinary pathway. If the pus is exhausted, it can heal by itself without medicine; it only requires proper regulation. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are instances where abdominal swelling gradually flows into the sac, causing severe swelling until the sac ruptures and fluid drains out. For this, apply powdered cedar charcoal externally and wrap it with perilla leaves, and rest on your back to nurture it. Generally, this condition is due to deficiency of the yin passage and damp-heat leading to discharge, so Yin-nourishing and damp-drying herbs are essential. When treating swelling and pain with urinary retention, prioritize eliminating dampness and supplementing Yin. Once the swelling and pain reduce and urination normalizes, treat with a combination of damp-drying and Yin-nourishing herbs. </p>
<p>If pus is desired, focus on removing pathogens as the main approach while supplementing Yin; once the pus forms, puncture it but continue to use the methods of removing pathogens and nourishing Yin. If the damp-heat is entirely resolved, rely solely on removing pathogens. In cases where the pus is clear or either abundant or slow to resolve, apply strong tonics or moxibustion with aconite cakes.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Yin Chuang (Genital Ulcer)</strong></p>
<p>In men, Yin Chuang, also known as Chǐ Chuang (shame sore), can cause pain at the tip or the body of the penis. This is due to an imbalance in the Hand and Foot Yang channels, with heat and toxins descending and entering the Foot Jueyin channel, leading to a purple-black coloration, causing ulceration that can destroy the penis and result in death. It is advisable to use Zihe Hexi Shui Wan to dispel dampness and toxins; there are no cases of it not healing. If an ulcer has already formed, first resolve its root, then treat from the exterior. Clean with the juice of scallions and black beans, then apply a fine powder of yellow silk, wood incense, Mita Sang, and dry carmine. If there is internal pus not discharging, use Chui Nang San to push it out, in addition to Zihe Hexi Shui Wan. If there is little pus in the rectum, you may use yellow silk, wood incense, and carmine as a compress.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>On Hernia</strong> by Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>Severe cases of hernia involve acute pain in the testicles and lower abdomen. Pain may be felt in the testicles or near the Wushi acupoint, all of which belong to the Jueyin meridian. There may be physical presence or absence, and sounds can be heard or not. The tangible form resembles a melon, and the sound resembles that of a frog. Since the &quot;Suwen,&quot; famous physicians through the ages have attributed this condition to cold. Cold is known to cause constriction; the channels become cold, leading to stagnation and pain. This reasoning is sound. There are instances of cold without hernia, which may also be linked to obstruction. </p>
<p>I have often experienced cold conditions—snow at the door with frost, water below the navel, and stepping on ice—without falling ill, as I traditionally possess no internal heat. Reflecting on this, I believe the condition arises from damp heat in the meridian, accumulating over time, and compounded by cold external influence; thus, the damp heat is unable to disperse and causes pain. If one solely discusses cold, it may be inadequate. Some may argue that the Jueyin meridian is deep and low in position; how can accumulated damp heat occur? I respond: great exertion brings fire to the heart, gluttony or drunkenness ignites fire in the stomach, sexual exhaustion ignites fire in the kidneys, and intense anger ignites fire in the liver. When fire accumulates in this meridian for long periods, it can deplete its mother, causing dampness to prevail.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The Jueyin is associated with wood and linked to the liver, serving as the office of the general. Its nature is swift and fiery, yet violent. Now, being constrained by cold, it is no wonder the pain is so severe. In my humble opinion, using aconite and gardenia, prepared as a decoction, may be effective. Following this formula, adjust according to the symptoms and conditions without fail. However, treatment must be divided based on the degree of dampness and heat. </p>
<p>For damp conditions, swelling predominates, which is characteristic of hernias. If there is a combination of deficiency, ginseng and atractylodes should be the main ingredients, supported by guiding herbs. Upon diagnosing the pulse, if it is very deep, tight, but large and without strength, this is indicative. The pain itself is light, merely feeling heavy, pulling, or dragging. </p>
<p>For the lower part when there is no pain, careful consideration shows that abstaining from sexual activity and rich foods is crucial. If one relies solely on medication, they merely shorten their lifespan. Herbs such as white atractylodes, fermented wheat, white angelica, hawthorn, chuanxiong, bitter orange, and pinellia are all necessary. Many tend to regard these herbs as lowly and thereby foster complacency, failing to abandon desires to protect their roots, which is not only unhelpful but often harmful. Additionally, the medication should be adjusted in accordance with the seasonal moisture and cold, following the principles of monarch, minister, and aids. Generally, hernias are more associated with dampness.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi】</p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The treatise on the utmost truth states: “The lower abdomen restrains the testicles, affecting the waist and spine, causing a rising sensation to the heart, leading to the expulsion of clear saliva and white fluids, and in severe cases, this sensation may reach the heart, causing sadness and forgetfulness.” The &quot;Classic of Simple and Complex&quot; says: “The pathogen resides in the small intestine.” When suffering from illness in the small intestine, there is pain in the lower abdomen that radiates to the waist and spine, affecting the liver and lungs. If the energy is weak and deficient, then wind-cold can invade. Once the pathogenic energy enters, it manifests as coldness, with symptoms rising to the liver and lungs, causing cold to diffuse in the chest and bind at the navel, pulling on the testicles, rising but unable to descend, causing abdominal pain, affecting the heart and chest, thus correlating with the related meridians.</p>
<p><strong>Bladder Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The treatise on obstruction states: “Bladder obstruction refers to pain in the lower abdomen and bladder; pressing on it causes pain within, as if doused with soup, leading to discomfort during urination, and resulting in clear mucus discharges.” The bladder is a governmental office for the region, where fluid is stored, and when the energy is transformed, it can be released. Now, if wind, cold, and damp pathogenic energy invade the bladder, then the energy cannot be transformed and released, causing fullness in the bladder and obstruction of the water passage. Symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen and bladder; pressing on it causes pain within. If doused with soup, there is discomfort during urination, with the foot’s Taiyang meridian directly affecting its flow, causing connections to the brain above and draining into the nasal passages below, resulting in clear mucus discharge.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>On Hernia</strong></p>
<p>I humbly note that Zihe&#39;s discussion of the seven sources of hernia disease is quite thorough; however, his prescriptions primarily rely on purgative methods for treatment, which may leave people in doubt. He states that many cases arise from debilitation due to sexual exhaustion, but can one universally apply purgative methods in such instances? Generally speaking, the seven types of hernia, if not caused by sexual exhaustion, may result from long journeys and hardships, crossing waters or walking on ice, which causes hot blood to congeal in the small intestine and bladder; or from damp heat entering the foot&#39;s Jueyin meridian. Ancient prescriptions uniformly considered this as cold complaints, solely utilizing warming herbs like Aconite and Fleeceflower for treatment, while my master Danxi independently determined it as damp heat, revealing an insight not previously recognized. When heat is trapped internally and cold binds externally, it is only natural that there would be extraordinary pain. Therefore, the treatment should expel the damp heat from the affected meridian, dissolve phlegm and blood in the lower jiao, and utilize cold to combat heat in a targeted manner, which makes it easier for the pathogen to subside and the illness to retreat. As for the purgative method, I humbly refrain from attempting it without further scholarly insight.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Erectile Dysfunction</strong></p>
<p>In men, erectile dysfunction can arise from a decline in the fire of the life gate and a deficiency of essence and energy. This is an established concept. However, there are also cases where excessive stagnant fire leads to dysfunction. The classics say: &quot;Strong fire consumes energy.&quot; This is akin to a person feeling fatigued and weak during the summer heat but becoming strong when winter arrives. I have personally witnessed a few individuals with kidney energy affected by stagnant fire presenting this condition. I recommended they take Huangbo and Zhimu to clear fire and strengthen the kidneys, which was effective. Thus, careful investigation is necessary; it should not be hastily attributed solely to diminished fire.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The penis is associated with the liver&#39;s meridian. The liver corresponds to wood; just as wood stands tall when met with gentle dew, it wilts in intense heat. If a patient suffers due to damp heat in the liver channel, one should use Longdan decoction to clear liver fire and dispel damp heat. If the patient suffers from dry heat in the liver channel, one should use Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish kidney water and support liver blood for stability.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Yin Deficiency Hernia</strong></p>
<p>If there is a combination of yin deficiency and hernia disease, one should use Yin Supplement Pills, adding one and a half taels of salt-fried苍术 (Atractylodes macrocephala), six qian each of yellow bitterness and ginger juice, and fried gardenia. One tael of Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), and five qian each of fried Wu Zhu Yu (Evodia rutaecarpa) and Qing Pi (Citri reticulatae viride pericarpium) should be included.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The symptoms primarily belong to the liver meridian. This may occur when the qi is stagnant or in cases of cold-dampness, leading to contraction in the wood element, restricted in this meridian. It can also arise from excessive dryness which depresses the wood element, or from emotions such as anger and sadness, which hinder the flow in this meridian. Furthermore, herbal treatments that stabilize externally may lead to closure of the orifices, shrinking the essence, and obstructing this meridian. The differences in these conditions should be recognized. Additionally, issues such as incontinence, urinary retention, impotence, and slippery white discharge are all hernias in men and should not be improperly attributed to kidney cold.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>When blood is exhausted and not flowing, and there is heat in the waist and knees, with feet feeling numb, throat dry, urinary obstruction, and a mass in the lower abdomen that may be fixed or moving, with the front genitalia protruding and hemorrhoids at the back, these are all manifestations of hernias in women. However, women do not refer to them as hernias but as &quot;jia.&quot; If a young person develops these symptoms, neither men nor women will have children. Therefore, these concealed and intricate issues are not related to the bladder, kidneys, or small intestines but rather to the path of the foot&#39;s jueyin. </p>
<p>I secretly suggest that if these symptoms arise from damp-heat in the liver channel, one should use stir-fried gardenia, poria, huanglian, and other herbs like dioscorea, angelica, and evodia, along with hawthorn. If there is both liver and kidney damp-heat, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan with additional chaihu and gardenia. If there is damp-heat due to yang deficiency in both the liver and spleen, one should tonify the middle and benefit qi, adding stir-fried gardenia, stir-fried black huanglian, and evodia. </p>
<p>There are seven types of hernias, each with different causes and treatment methods.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Remedies</strong><br><em>By Fang Xian (Ming Dynasty)</em></p>
<p><strong>Constricted Spleen</strong></p>
<p>This relates to the Jueyin channel, where its tendons and vessels flow around the yin organs and connect to the root of the tongue. When the Jueyin channel suffers from illness, its tendons and vessels become reactive, hence a rolled and constricted tongue is difficult to treat. For treatment, use the Decoction of Dong Quai and Four Extreme Herbs, and the Ginger and Wuzhuyu Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Cao&#39;s Source of Diseases&quot; discusses hernias as painful conditions, referred to by names such as Jue, Zheng, Han, Pan, Qi, Fu, and Lang. These seven names correspond to types of hernias. Jue hernia manifests with cold feet and heart pain, accompanied by vomiting and inability to eat, while Zheng hernia presents with sudden abdominal distension and severe pain beneath the heart, causing gas buildup similar to an arm. A hernia due to cold dietary intake leads to pain in the lower abdomen, termed Han hernia. Qi hernia features intermittent abdominal fullness and pain, while Pan hernia has pain next to the navel. Fu hernia involves accumulation below the navel, and Lang hernia is characterized by pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the genital area, along with difficulty in defecation. Symptoms can be verified upon manifestation. Moreover, there are stone hernias, blood hernias, yin hernias, jealous hernias, and qi hernias—these five have names but lack forms.Externally, there are heart hernias, cold hernias, hunger hernias, and multiple types of hernias, which have different names but share similar illnesses.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>In popular usage, these are referred to as &quot;small intestine qi,&quot; &quot;bladder qi,&quot; &quot;running pig qi,&quot; &quot;twisted intestine qi,&quot; &quot;horizontal string,&quot; &quot;vertical string,&quot; &quot;lateral droop,&quot; &quot;wood kidney,&quot; &quot;kidney remnants,&quot; &quot;yin swelling,&quot; and &quot;hernia,&quot; each with distinct names. As for Zhang Zihe’s discussion of the seven hernias, he mentions &quot;cold hernia,&quot; &quot;water hernia,&quot; &quot;muscle hernia,&quot; &quot;blood hernia,&quot; &quot;fox hernia,&quot; &quot;qi hernia,&quot; and &quot;tuǐ hernia,&quot; which differ from other discussions. For example, the &quot;tuǐ hernia&quot; refers to a hard swelling of the outer kidney. If it is painful, it is called &quot;yin swelling&quot;; if not painful, it is &quot;wood kidney&quot;; if it droops on one side, it is &quot;lateral droop.&quot; Although there are many different names and classifications for hernias, the Ling Shu says: the pathogen resides in the small intestine, linking to the testicles and associated with the kidney, and connects to the liver and affects the heart. When the qi is abundant, it causes counterflow of the qi upwards. The Nei Jing further states: when the Ren vessel is affected, men present with seven internal hernias, while women experience discharge and masses. When the Chong vessel is reversed, it leads to urgent qi. Therefore, while the Ren vessel is called a source of disease with the name of seven hernias, it does not manifest the forms of the seven hernias. The Ren vessel is the foundational source of hernia diseases, while the other meridians represent the tributaries of hernia afflictions.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>It is also said: The Jueyin pulse is slippery for fox hernia, the Shaoyang pulse is slippery for liver wind hernia, the Taiyin pulse is slippery for spleen wind hernia, the Shaoyin pulse is slippery for heart wind hernia, the Taiyang pulse is slippery for kidney wind hernia, and the Yangming pulse is slippery for lung wind hernia. This wind is not an external wind entering, but rather the wind generated by the movement of the liver&#39;s wooden Yang organ energy. These six hernias correspond to the six channels and are located in the five organs. What is meant by hernia diseases being related to the liver? The disease arises from Yin, starting from below; Yin pertains to the internal. The Taiyin (spleen), Jueyin (liver), and Shaoyin (kidney) are all lower Yin channels. The &quot;below&quot; refers to cold energy from the ground; the feet often touch the ground, thus the wind and cold of heaven and earth all enter into the ground, and the wind and dampness in humans arise from the feet. Sometimes due to deficiency in the channels, energy accumulates in the bladder and lower abdomen, where the two Yins converge and the two energies clash, causing pain. Or it could be from excessive cold drinks, causing water to return to the kidneys, or from sitting or lying in dampness, where cold oppresses the Yin, attacking the Yin and resulting in hernia pain. The classic states: Pain indicates passage. When hernia energy causes pain, it should be treated to promote passage rather than block; warmth is preferred over coolness. Promotion means to drain what is real, without draining what is deficient. Cold means to nourish the deficiency, but not to nourish what is real.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The real is the evil qi, and the void is the righteous qi. If the righteous qi is extremely weak, one must first warm it and then drain it. If the evil qi is extremely strong, one must first drain it and then supplement it. Warming must be paired with qi, while draining must be paired with cold. Cold enters the channels and leads the evil, while warmth disperses the qi and nourishes the righteous. Generally, the qi from both inside and outside that enters the kidneys is the kidney qi; that which enters the bladder is the bladder qi; and that which enters the small intestine is the small intestine qi. The kidneys and bladder are organs that are interconnected; their qi communicates and forms the outer kidney, connected to the testes. These three channels are linked and are the site of illness. Their pulse should be string-like and tight; string-like indicates cold, and tight indicates pain. Pain arises from cold, and swelling arises from dampness. If healing is not achieved, the evil qi lingers and accumulates, resulting in pain; either in the sides resembling a cup or in the navel above and below resembling an arm, or the abdomen being distended like a toad, causing one to become emaciated, short of breath, with chills and fevers, excessive sleeping, and poor appetite resulting in fullness and vomiting. The physician should examine attentively; if it is due to emotional disturbances, one should adjust the qi and settle the five organs; if it is caused by external evils, dispersing dampness and expelling cold should take precedence. Eliminating the substantial evil and supplementing the deficient liver will lead to healing, without doubt.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>Key Techniques for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Dai Siguang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tongue Contraction</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is rolled and contracted; this condition exists not only in the Yin within Yin but also when Yangming heat penetrates into Jueyin. This is because Yangming governs the zong (the primary) tendons, and these tendons are blown by heat and wind, resulting in a lack of nourishment, leading to the tongue being rolled and contracted. In such cases, one should purge the Yang to rescue the Yin, and the appropriate remedy would be Da Chengqi Decoction. For contracted tongue in the Jueyin, it is crucial to expel the contents urgently. In such cases, one should promptly use purgative agents. If one should purge but does not, the heat and toxins will deepen, which may lead to an inability to evacuate and become irreparable. Therefore, it is not advisable to delay purgative treatment when it is clearly needed.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Small Intestine Qi</p>
<p>Qi gathers due to cold, causing hernia; blood gathers due to cold, causing mass; this is hernia qi, now referred to as transverse or longitudinal strings, circling the navel and causing pain in the lower abdomen. One should take scallion powder and swallow it with medicinal pills for internal dissolution, or use a salt and wine mixture with different effectiveness. Regardless of the symptoms, one can use fresh material of Wuling powder, adding half or one qian of stir-fried fennel. If the medication is ineffective and the pain is severe and persistent, accompanied by coldness in the hands and feet, one should use Xiangfuzi, stir-fried with salt, and apply it hot wrapped in silk around the navel. If the major and minor bowels are not very open, one may use Wuling powder with cinnamon and add Qingmuxiang pills. If there are initial symptoms such as headache, fever, or aversion to cold with strong heat, one should also use Shen Su Decoction with added Muxiang. If there is Qi reversing and attacking the heart, causing unexpected pain in the heart, one should extract natural juice from fresh leeks, mix it with Wuling powder to form pills, take with fennel soup; this can also be used interchangeably in heart pain symptoms. If there is movement in kidney Qi and heart Qi arises, causing pain above and below, one should take a special decoction with medicinal pills for internal dissolution. Alternatively, focus exclusively on treating the lower pain; once that is resolved, the pain will cease.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>(Nè Tuí) Hernia</strong></p>
<p>One lump may hang down or swell; or one lump may retract into the lower abdomen, causing unbearable pain, which can only be alleviated by pressing it back, known as (Nè Tuí) Qi. It is recommended to take scallion powder and swallow Zhu Yu’s internal digesting pills. If not healed, take Bi Cheng Qie powder and swallow large fennel pills. </p>
<p>If there is no passage for the bowels, it is advisable to use Mu Xiang pills applied externally to facilitate smoothness. Moreover, take ten centipedes, remove the head, legs, and wings, crush and fry them, then remove the centipede to eliminate fire toxicity. Decoct this vigorously, mix it with lantern heart soup, and take it along with Wu Ling San in doses of fifty to seventy pills; or use lantern heart and scallion boiled in water and wine, then mix with Wu Ling San.</p>
<p>If the pain moves into the abdomen, counter-attacking the heart and leading to nausea and vomiting, first, use salty wine to take Yang Zheng Dan, then use raw materials from Wu Ji San with added Wu Zhu Yu, fennel, peach kernel, and Yan Hu Suo, each stir-fried to a half coin weight.</p>
<p>If there is a large (Nè Tuí) lump like a dou (a measure), and no medicine proves effective, it is advisable to use the Dang Gui Si Ni decoction with additional ginger and Zhu Yu, which has been effective in the past.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Hernia Pain</strong></p>
<p>Hernia pain is related to the Foot Jueyin Liver Channel. The lower abdomen is also associated with the Liver Channel. Therefore, the treatment for hernia pain is the same as that for lower abdominal pain. The so-called hernia refers to pain in the testicles connected to lower abdominal pain. The pain may be solely in the testicles or predominantly in one side of the lower abdomen. When the testicle is swollen like a rice bowl, it is known as a &quot;stomach hernia.&quot; If the pain appears when standing, lying down, moving in and out, it is called a &quot;fox hernia.&quot;</p>
<p>There are three causes of lower abdominal pain due to Qi dynamics: First, a liver condition can cause pain in the lower abdomen and sides. The classics say: &quot;The Jueyin recovery leads to a firm, swollen lower abdomen and violent inner pain.&quot; This arises due to wind and Qi aiding the excessive liver, so the treatment should involve draining the liver. It is also said that in years of excessive metal, people suffer from pain below the ribs and in the lower abdomen. Additionally, in years with insufficient wood, dryness takes hold, causing people distress in the ribs and lower abdomen. Furthermore, in years with inadequate earth, the wind becomes rampant, leading to abdominal pain and subsequently, severe pain in the chest and ribs, radiating to the lower abdomen. This happens when dryness attacks the liver&#39;s deficiency, so the treatment should nourish the liver and drain excess metal.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the small intestine, if the ailment causes pain in the lower abdomen and radiates to the testicles and spinal area, it aligns with the classic reference: &quot;The Shaoyin channel when heated beneath the heart leads to hunger and pain below the navel.&quot;<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>It is also said: When the Lesser Yin (Shaoyin) recovers, internal heat manifests, causing cramping pain in the lower abdomen; this occurs because heat augments the fullness of the small intestine, and the treatment should focus on purging the small intestine. Furthermore, when the Greater Yang (Taiyang) is at the spring, cold dominates, and in conjunction with the recovery of the Greater Yang, both cause pain in the lower abdomen, affecting the testicles, causing pain that radiates to the waist and spine, and possibly leads to heart pain. When the Greater Yin (Taiyin) governs the heavens, and extreme cold approaches, abdominal pain arises from cold pathogens attacking the deficiency of the small intestine; thus, the treatment should be to supplement the small intestine and dispel the cold pathogens. </p>
<p>The third discusses the bladder; its ailment manifests as pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, along with inability to urinate. The classic states: When the Greater Yin is at the spring, pain and swelling in the lower abdomen with inability to urinate results from damp pathogens attacking the deficiency of the bladder. Therefore, the treatment should supplement the bladder and remove the dampness from the earth.</p>
<p>A slippery pulse observed above the guan indicates great heat, which arises from the combination of Yang and Yang, hence the significant heat. A slippery pulse at the chi position indicates great cold, leading to (inguinal) hernias. The slippery pulse refers to the name of the gate of life, indicating that the fire of the bright and dark yin together in the lower region cannot withstand the cold water, thus resulting in (inguinal) hernias.</p>
<p>In the context of hernias, it is stated: When the Yangming governs the heavens and is overcome by dryness, male (inguinal) hernias occur, along with abdominal pain in females. It is further stated that when Yangming prevails, and external (inguinal) hernias appear, this indicates that the dryness pathogen attacks the liver, resulting in qi deficiency. Therefore, the treatment should be to nourish the liver and dispel the drying metal element.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Medical Works, Volume Two Hundred and One</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anterior Yin Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine [Ming - Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Overindulgence in drink and food, laboring excessively, and the excitement of anger can cause fire to stir. If fire lingers, it generates dampness, leading to the stagnation of fluids into phlegm and turbid matter that flow into the liver channel. The liver is characterized by rapid and violent activity, and when constrained by external cold, this results in severe pain. There are specific cases related to cold, which can indicate issues with the ears. Generally, heat manifests upon exposure; symptoms include red and painful urination, heat in the lower abdomen and rectum, and a sense of urgent fullness in the genitals. In contrast, when exposed to cold, symptoms include smooth, frequent urination, a cool sensation in the flanks and abdomen, and constriction in the external genitals. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are cases where the balance between hot and cold is disrupted, leading to either cold or heat in the external genitals and lower abdomen, with urination either obstructed or frequent. Texts often refer to qi of the small intestine, bladder, and kidney as peripheral issues, but they actually pertain primarily to the liver. The liver encircles the yin organs and connects upwards into the small intestine while both the liver and kidneys are connected downward, associating with the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels. The kidneys and bladder function as organs, with their energies interconnected, functioning as the external kidneys linked to the testicles. These three channels are connected and converge. However, the liver governs the tendons; although the testicles are termed external kidneys, they are not part of the Jueyin, thus the genitals lack the means to contract and expand. In women, this corresponds to the external reproductive organs.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The classics say: The pathology resides in the small intestine, connected to the testicular cords which belong to the kidneys, penetrating through the liver and linking to the lungs. The heart is related to vigorous qi, which causes reversal and ascension, while the intestines and stomach affect the liver, disseminating through the diaphragm and settling at the navel, primarily originating from the jueyin region below. When discussing the pulses of the three organs, all are considered slippery when it comes to hernias. When it is said that &quot;wind hernia&quot; occurs, it is not external wind, but rather the wind generated by the movement of the liver&#39;s wood qi. </p>
<p>Speaking of the hernias from the three yang, it is stated that the bladder is not the site of the disease but must transmit to the liver before becoming a hernia. Additionally, the treatment methods at the &quot;Mingtang&quot; point for hernias all target the jueyin part, indicating that the liver meridian is primarily responsible for hernias.</p>
<p>The small intestine is a channel abundant in qi but deficient in blood. Anger, anxiety, and worry arise from the liver, causing stagnation in the heart qi. The heart and small intestine are interlinked, with external qi accumulating without release, attacking the bladder. The kidneys gather qi, yet overexertion in sexual activities can lead to the draining of essence, accumulating as phlegm which causes qi stagnation internally. The channel and true qi of the membranes manifest in bladder distention, all of which are governed by the liver.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the disease manifests, it does not solely cause pain in the external kidneys or lower abdomen, but can also stab the waist and ribs, wander through the chest and back, or present as acute heart pain or circling abdominal pain. In men, it may lead to nocturnal emissions; in women, the cessation of menstruation, causing emaciation and shortness of breath, accompanied by chills and fever, reduced appetite, vomiting, and sour regurgitation. If this persists, it may lead to severe vomiting, further leading to symptoms such as arched back, clenched jaws, profuse cold sweat, and unrelenting cold sweating, making it difficult to treat.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>There are various types of hernia: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there is testicular pain, it may also be connected to lower abdominal pain. When one is affected by cold or anger, a lump may rise up to the root of the scrotum. When the heart is calm and the energy is balanced, the lump will return to its proper place in the sac.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the case of water hernia, the sac appears like crystal water, may itch and leak yellow fluid, or sweat may occur spontaneously. When pressed, it sounds like water in the lower abdomen. It can result from excessive drinking and engaging in sexual activity, as well as external pathogens accumulating within the sac.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Muscle hernia presents as swelling of the penis, which may either extend long and not retract, or cause extreme pain and itching, usually from excessive sexual activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blood hernia feels like cucumbers on both sides of the lower abdomen, commonly referred to as &quot;toxins of the body.&quot; It can occur from heat in spring and summer, when one’s energy is exhausted, causing blood to seep into the bladder sac and resulting in lumps and swellings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Air hernia connects to the renal region above and the scrotum below. It may arise from prolonged crying and anger, resulting in stagnation and swelling. Laboring while riding may also cause lumps, which can be difficult to treat depending on their size.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fox hernia appears like an inverted tile; when lying down it shifts into the lower abdomen, similar to how a fox comes out of its burrow to urinate during the day and returns at night without urinating. This type shares similarities with air hernia.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cold hernia causes the sac to become cold, hard like stone, leading to impotence, or pain when pressing on the testicles. It results from cold and dampness, along with internal overexertion, potentially resulting in infertility over time.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The names of these seven types of hernias come from the intentions of classical texts; the rest are erroneous and not to be used. Generally, if hernias persist for a long time, they accumulate and attach around the navel, both above and below, to the left and right, becoming lumps or symptoms. A swelling that is hard and painful like stone indicates the condition, especially in women, where it manifests as a protrusion at the vulva. Pain arises from cold, swelling from dampness; when cold and damp compete, and heat and toxins are added, the swelling hardens like stone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Intestinal hernia refers to gas in the small intestine, causing hanging and swelling of the outer kidney and itchiness. Ovarian hernia presents as hardened swelling, leading to twisting pain near the navel; if severe, it can cause contraction of the genitals and coldness in the limbs, with ulcers developing on the sac, resulting in boils. Two cases accompanied by continuous discharge of fluid indicate death. </p>
<p>Inflammatory hernia typically arises from underlying damp heat and can be triggered by anger, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, convulsions, a dark complexion, and the testicles shifting, which is termed air hernia. Treatments include medicinal combinations with ingredients like mushroom, pepper, and specific traditional formulations. </p>
<p>For watery hernia, there is great swelling, comparable to a dou (a unit of measurement) or sheng (another unit), without pain or itchiness, usually resulting from excessive dampness. It can be treated with herbal mixtures like Wuling San, adding fennel or chives to form pills, and serving with bamboo shoot soup. In cases of heat, various powders, such as Sanbai San and Juhuo San, can help. For chronic conditions, Juzi He Wan is beneficial.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The kidney is hard and inflexible; there is no pain, indicating that the heart fire does not descend and the kidney water is not warmed. Use Huoren pills, Sizhijuyuan pills, and the Four-Cooked Chuanlian pills. Alternatively, one can use the leaves of male paper mulberry that do not bear fruit, dried and powdered, shaped into pills the size of wutong (phoenix tree) seeds, taking 59 of them with hollow salt liquor. In cases of traumatic injury with startled qi and stagnant blood, one should resolve the stagnant blood.</p>
<p>For uneven swelling, whether large or small, left-sided swelling suggests excessive stagnant blood and anger, or kidney qi deficiency; right-sided swelling often indicates damp phlegm and food accumulation. Thus, it is important to understand the diagnosis of hernia and the seven types of hernia, and treatment should be thorough. For external treatment, rub with waist ointment.</p>
<p>Although hernia involves dampness and heat, it arises from the yin and begins below. The four energies commonly first injure the three Yin parts of the foot, which is why it occurs upon external invasion.</p>
<p>In cases of wind symptoms, with pain along the small intestine yin meridian, severe pain accompanied by sweating and body aches, use Wutou Guizhi decoction. For incontinence, use Sijunzi decoction plus Qianghuo and Fuzi.</p>
<p>For cold symptoms, with heart pain, muscle contraction, and cold limbs, nausea after eating, use Guxiang Zhi decoction or Wujisan with Wu Yao, Xiao Hui, and a little salt, along with Sizhijuyuan pills and Liu Lian pills.</p>
<p>For summer heat symptoms, with urgency and distention in the lower abdomen and difficulty urinating, use Xiangru drink plus Qumai and Mutong.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>For damp syndromes, characterized by heaviness of the body, ineffective urination, and possibly loose stools, the best remedy is Wuling San. For damp-heat entering the interior, causing severe pain, modify Chai Ling Tang or Ba Zheng San. In cases of excessive dampness, use Dao Shui Wan or San Bai San, or adjust the Fu Yuan Tong Sheng San with Heichou. For deficiencies, use Shi Wei Cang Lou San. If there are signs of cold and heat in the exterior, use Chai Hu Gui Zhi Tang.</p>
<p>For hernias from the seven emotions, which fluctuate between fullness and reduction, if damp-heat is present, remedies include Qidan Yin or Gu Yu Lian Wan; if cold is present, use Pan Cong San or Shen Liao Mu Xiang Yun Qi San.</p>
<p>Wuling San is generally applicable. Zhu Ling and Ze Xie balance yin and yang to harmonize the heart and small intestine, Bai Zhu helps with moisture and stagnant blood in the waist; Fu Ling aids the bladder&#39;s water. When the liver wood is exhausted from the influence of Gui, it is necessary to control the liver wood. To counteract the wind, mix Gui Zhi with Zi Su, fresh ginger, and a small amount of salt. For heat, add Bai Shao; for dampness, add Bai Zhu; for small intestine qi, add Xiao Huan; for bladder qi, add Jin Ling Zi and Ju He; for kidney qi, add Bing Lang and a little Mu Tong.</p>
<p>In general, hernia pain that travels without form is due to qi. Pain that has a location and form indicates damp phlegm and food stagnation, with stagnant blood aggregating below to form the condition.</p>
<p>For phlegm-related hernias, use Hai Shi and Xiang Fu, mixed with ginger juice for oral administration. For phlegm, food stagnation, and to maintain efficacy, use Shou Xiao Wan.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>For food stagnation with blood stasis, use the Zhizhi Peach and Hawthorn Powder or the Shixiao Powder. For food stagnation combined with heat, use the Jishan Pill. For food stagnation with deficiency, use the Eight Flavor Fennel Pill. </p>
<p>For a sudden itching from deficiency and hernia, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Chuanlianzi, fennel, bitter orange, hawthorn, and gardenia. If pressing does not cause pain, add cinnamon and ginger juice. If pressing is irregular, use cassia twig, aconite, and gardenia as a powder, mix with ginger juice to make pills, and take with ginger decoction, which can greatly relieve pain. If it persists, use the San Yu Nei Xiao Pill. Generally, for deficiency hernias, excessive tonification is inappropriate. The classics say: where evils converge, their energy must be deficient. If remaining without release, the illness becomes real. One must first drain the accumulated heat before tonifying; hence many formulas borrow from the energy of euphorbia.</p>
<p>If deficiency is severe, leading to vomiting and sperm leakage, it is critical. It is essential to recognize that damp heat is the illness; both should be treated with drainage from the south and tonification from the north, and harsh agents should not be recklessly used.</p>
<p>For prolonged symptoms of masses and abdominal fullness like an arm, use the White Onion Powder or the Adjusting Middle Decoction with added Ferula. For abdominal pain with masses beside the navel, use the Gathering Fragrance Drink or the Huluba Pill. For abdominal pain with masses below the navel, use the Golden Bell Pill. If there is a risk of a running piglet, use the Poria Cinnamon Licorice Decoction.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>For those suffering from acute pain due to running pig (hernia), use a modified Da Qiqi Decoction with pan-roasted Qian Niu. Universally applicable is the Er Chen Decoction with added ginger juice. For accumulation, add Zhi Shi and Shan Zha; for heat, add Shan Zhi; for pain, include Ju Zi He; for blood stasis, add Yan Hu Suo, Tao Ren, while for excess, add Mu Xiang and Huai Xiang; for severe pain, incorporate Ru Xiang and Mo Yao; if the kidney is enlarged like a斗, use Huai Xiang, Qing Pi, Kun Bu, and Hai Zao in pill form. </p>
<p>For water hernia, add Zhu Ling and Ze Xie to expel water; for muscle hernia, include Huang Lian, Bai Zhu, and Fu Ling to reduce fire; for blood hernia, combine Si Wu Decoction to regulate blood; if not cured, use Qing Gan Yi Rong Decoction or Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction; for qi hernia, add Chai Hu, Qing Pi, and Xiang Fu to move qi; for fox hernia, use Qing Pi, Xiang Fu, and Cang Zhu to guide qi flow, plus fourteen spider pieces and five qian of Gui Zhi ground into powder and taken with honey; for (illness-related) hernia, combine Bai Zhu, Cang Zhu, Zhu Ling, and Ze Xie, decocted to mix with the lychee kernel powder; for cold hernia, add Wu Yu, ginger, and cinnamon for warmth. </p>
<p>Commonly used are warming and blood-breaking herbs, phlegm dispersers such as Ju Zi He powder, warming and dispersing qi agents like Wu Chao Chuan Lian Wan, Si Chao Chuan Lian Wan, Jin Ling Wan, Si Wei Huai Xiang San, Gu Yan Xie San, a grain of Chen Sha Dan, and Shen Sheng Dai Zhen San, selected as needed.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Road Intersection</strong></p>
<p>For swelling and pain, orally take the Single Spider Recipe, and externally apply fried green onions compress three to five times. Later, use disinfecting and swelling-reducing medicines with rhubarb, calabash fruit, southern star, and wild ginger for application. If it breaks, use raw skin powder. This condition mostly occurs in children, often due to food accumulation and phlegm obstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Yin ulcers arise from kidney deficiency combined with wind and dampness, whereby evil qi invades, causing itching and ulceration, with seepage resembling sores and eczema.</p>
<p><strong>Jealousy Sores</strong></p>
<p>Jealousy sores result from prolonged abstinence and desire, leading to wasted essence flowing into the base; it initially appears like millet, red and swollen, ulcerating into a cavity, accompanied by pain, itching, and discomfort.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br><strong>Yin Shi (Yin Erosion)</strong></p>
<p>Yin erosion sores occur when a woman&#39;s uterus has stagnant impurities or when menstrual discharge is not clear. If she has intercourse without washing afterwards, and the man has kidney deficiency with damp pathogens blocking the energy, it can lead to swelling and pain in the penis and testicles, with painful urination resembling a drip.</p>
<p><strong>Yang Mei (Yang Mei Sore)</strong></p>
<p>If it has long been ulcerated, invading the muscles, with continuous bleeding, it becomes a lower sore (xie), which, if not healed for a long time, develops into a Yang Mei sore. It is advisable to take Xian Yi Liang soup as a preventive measure. </p>
<p>For a body feeling hot and strong heat with aversion to cold, urgent treatment is necessary. If there is deficiency of Yin blood with heat, Small Chai Hu Decoction should be taken with ginseng, atractylodes, spicy angelica, and return herb; for swelling, pain, and fever, Four Substances Decoction should be added with Chai Hu and gardenia; if there is damp heat and pain, breaking out with cold or heat symptoms, Small Chai Hu Decoction should be supplemented with gentian, coptis, and green skin; if heat dominates causing constipation, Eight Correcting Powder should be used; if severe damp heat causes swelling and painful urination with shrinking penis, or discharge of white fluid, Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction should be taken. </p>
<p>If there is Qi deficiency, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be taken with gentian and gardenia; for unending thirst, Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction should be used. After swelling and ulceration, if there is Qi and blood deficiency with fire, Eight Substances Decoction should be used with Chai Hu and gardenia; if there is no fire and stool is soft, Tuo Li San and Nei Tuo Shi Xuan San should be administered. </p>
<p>In summary, the root of this condition lies in Yin deficiency of the Liver meridian, while swelling and pain are symptoms. Continuous consumption of Shen Qi pills is advisable, but focusing solely on treating the liver would be improper.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Itching in the Genitals</strong></p>
<p>Itching in the genitals with white discharge is often due to a weakness of the spleen and earth, which fails to nourish metal and water. This results in a deficiency of blood in the liver channel, leading to dryness and excess heat. It is advisable to take a formula for tonifying the middle and benefiting qi together with a heart-clearing lotus seed drink. The spleen and stomach are the source for the liver and kidneys, and the heart is the main organ.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Various Sores</strong></p>
<p>For external treatment: </p>
<ul>
<li>For damp and yin sores, use the Huanghe powder or copper green powder. </li>
<li>For sores caused by jealousy, use the Jin Tiao powder or camphor powder. </li>
<li>For yin erosion sores, use the Feng Yi powder. </li>
<li>For lower sores, use the Huan Luo powder. </li>
<li>For swollen and painful conditions of broken genitalia, use the E Guan powder. </li>
<li>For foul and perforating sores, use the Jie Gan powder, or apply washing medicine. </li>
<li>For sores on the genitals that do not heal after a long time, mix ash from burnt cloth with honey to apply, which will heal it. </li>
<li>For itching due to worms in the pubic hair, mash peach kernels and apply the paste.</li>
</ul>
<p>For sores on either side of the scrotum with severe dampness and itchiness, use the Mufan Dan. If there are wind-damp sores on the thighs, use the Liu Bing powder.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Cystic Abscess</strong></p>
<p>At the initial onset, there is swelling, redness, pain, difficulty in urination, chills and fever with thirst. One should clear the liver fire and disperse the damp heat to relieve it. Black Dragon Decoction and Kidney-Strengthening Pills are recommended. If it arises from sexual activity, and the cyst is as large as a bowl, with abdominal bloating, heat in urination, dry mouth, and phlegm obstruction, it is critically urgent. Kidney Qi Pills should be used, adding Plantago seeds and Achyranthes, decocted and taken with Kidney-Strengthening Pills. If after draining damp heat there is still swelling and pain, one should nourish Yin and expel it to hasten the maturation of the pus for needling. If pus forms and there is constipation, it indicates heat toxin obstruction; one should use remedies to dispel toxins and support the interior. If it does not lessen, the heat toxins are not cleared; one should use Liver-Enhancing Decoction. Once pus has formed, use the Life-Saving Decoction. </p>
<p>If the pus bursts and the skin sloughs off, with the testicles hanging, or if a muscle strand remains inside and does not dissolve, and the scrotum completely rots, beneath the penis at the cyst, it also rots like half a pen tube. One should apply dispersing remedies with added Caoguo, Astragalus, Schisandra, and Cuscus, or use Four Substance Decoction with Ginseng and Atractylodes, taken with Kidney Qi Pills, alongside the Renowned Energy-Enhancing Decoction with increased Astragalus, Angelica, and Atractylodes to greatly replenish Qi, Blood, Spleen, and Stomach. It is imperative to avoid cold, attacking treatments, and any dampness-draining, Yin-depleting medicines. Topically apply white wax ointment; the cyst and shaft can restore in ten days. Even if one has removed the scrotum, there is no harm.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>便毒</p>
<p>It is commonly referred to as &quot;biandu,&quot; but it is actually blood stasis. It occurs between the legs, hips, and lower abdomen, involving the liver channel and the three vessels of Chong, Ren, and Du, which are the pathways for the movement of vital energy. </p>
<p>This may result from retaining semen during intercourse, unfulfilled desire, or failure to relieve oneself when necessary, leading to stagnant essence and the formation of blood stasis, causing swelling and pain in the area between the hips and abdomen. </p>
<p>Initially, one should use Wuling San to resolve the stagnant essence, and for constipation, add Dahuang. If there are signs of cold or heat, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with additions of Zhizi and Zexie. Afterward, Kidney Qi Wan should be employed to replenish essence and remove blood stasis. </p>
<p>If there is internal damp-heat and external cold evils repelling each other, it will prevent the resolution of this stasis. The treatment should aim to clear liver fire, invigorate blood circulation, and promote kidney drainage of pathological water. For those with significant difficulty in both bowel movements, use Liangjie Tang or Bazheng San. </p>
<p>If there is accompanying anger, use Liqu Si Yin, or consider Yan Tong Qi San with the additions of floral powder, Baizhi, and Qingmuxiang. For severe swelling and pain, employ Huo Ming Yin.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>For those with damp-heat stagnation, use Longdan Xiegan Decoction. For individuals with thin bodies and easy constipation or frequent urination, add Chaihu to Xiao Chaihu Decoction along with Qing, Gui, Zhi, Poria, and ZeXie; this may have miraculous effects. For severe pain, use Huoming Drink with Dahuang. If damp-heat is caused by exhaustion and Qi stagnation, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. After abscesses, it&#39;s advisable to use Toli San and Baofu Decoction with Chaihu, or Shiquan Dabu Decoction. For longstanding issues that may cause leakage, use Lafen Wan. Using only purple-flowered dandelion ground with wine is most effective. For toxins on both sides or those originating from previous sores, or sudden onset of painful lumps, use the same medicine as before. For initial cases, it&#39;s recommended to use Guolao Gao with a small amount of soapwort charcoal. Externally, wash with a decoction of phoenix tail grass, then use fine pine resin powder thrice daily for self-healing. After recovery, continue to avoid sexual activity.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles: Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>Diseases of the Anterior Yin</strong>  </p>
<p>Impotence: The prescription texts say that when a man is robust, he thinks of intimacy. The Inner Canon states that in a man of twenty-eight, the vital energy is abundant, and the yin and yang overflow. However, if there is excessive depletion, and the seminal fluid is exhausted, then the yang channels become weak, leading to impotence. Even middle-aged men may be able to perform but lack vigor, all due to insufficient essence. Those who are unaware hastily categorize this as yang deficiency and blindly resort to medicines like cassia, ashwagandha, epimedium, and cistanche, which merely aggravate the evil fire and deplete the true yin. This can culminate in a sudden stroke and death, but no one realizes it. Zhu Xi said that after having children, one should not lose even a little essence, for it is truly a life-preserving strategy. People only recognize desire and do not appreciate the value of life, recklessly pushing their limits on a perilous path, which is truly lamentable.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>If one has no children but possesses this condition, one must greatly nourish the qi and blood, enhance yin and assist essence, supplemented with ingredients such as deer antler, deer horn glue, epimedium, and cynomorium, in order to concurrently nourish the fire of the life gate and stimulate the original yang. One must also carefully assess the deficiency or excess of qi and blood. For overweight individuals, one should greatly supplement qi and gather the essence; for underweight individuals, nourishing yin should take precedence, focusing on the Eight Ingredients Pill. For thin people, the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, combined with goji berries, dodder, schisandra, and deer horn glue, works well. </p>
<p>For impotence, one should attribute it to excessive decline of essence. The classic states: when the liver meridian of the foot is injured internally, it does not rise. The Eight Ingredients Pill from Zhongjing is particularly effective. In severe cases, one may add ginseng, deer glue, and deer antler, or add epimedium, cynomorium, and goji berries, which also supports the fire of the right kidney. Although it has been previously mentioned that one should not carelessly use drugs like cinnamon and aristolochia to concoct the true yin, if it truly pertains to a deficiency of true yang, one should indeed nourish the source of fire; thus, there is no need to rigidly adhere to the earlier discussion. </p>
<p>Yin sweating and yin odor are both related to damp heat in the lower body, resulting from excessive indulgence in overly rich alcohol and flavors; for this, Longdan Decoction for Liver Drainage is excellent.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>For internal use, take Qing&#39;e pill; for external use, apply powdered Lu Gan stone and crab powder, or mix Mitodeng with Cnidium seeds and apply the powder. For those with excessive yin sweat, use Erchen and Erzhu with wind-dispelling herbs like Fangfeng, Qianghuo, and Gao Ben to counter it. </p>
<p>Yin contraction refers to the front yin being cold and entering the abdomen. Yin expansion means the front yin is heated, elongated, and does not retract. The texts state: if the tendons of the foot&#39;s Jueyin are injured by cold, they contract inward; if injured by heat, they stretch and do not retract. </p>
<p>Yin itching is also due to liver damp-heat; using Xia Liver Decoction is effective. For thin people experiencing dryness and itching related to yin deficiency, focus on Kan and Li, and externally use a decoction of Cnidium seeds for washing. (Treat sores and worms similarly, but distinguish between deficiency and excess). </p>
<p>For penile pain caused by stagnation of Qi and heat in the foot&#39;s Jueyin, use licorice twigs to help alleviate the Qi.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>If there is a painful condition resembling a difficult-to-treat illness, it is essential to clear the lung energy and separate the pure from the turbid. For qi deficiency, use Six Gentlemen Decoction; for blood deficiency, use Four Substances Decoction, adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Huashi, Shiwui, and Amber. For阴 pain, it is advisable to soothe stagnation and harmonize the blood; add Xiangfu and Honghua to the Four Substances Decoction. According to &quot;Qianjin Fang,&quot; if someone experiences a gradual onset of阴 cold, with swelling and a fullness in the scrotum, causing persistent dull pain day and night, grind high-quality Chuanjiao into powder, wrap it in silk and apply to the area; if there is no sensation of heat, applying warmth is even better, adjusting to the person’s sensitivity. Internally, decoct Dajici soup and administer. If experiencing阴 cold, with sweating like water and weakness in the legs, one should use Liver Tonifying Decoction. </p>
<p>After an illness, sexual activity may cause egg pain, which greatly depletes qi and blood; thus, add Cinnamon and Fuzi to the Eight Treasures Decoction. </p>
<p>Post-illness if there is阴 swelling affecting the lower abdomen and legs, it pertains to both spleen and kidney deficiency. Little appetite and poor digestion point to spleen weakness, so tonifying the spleen comes first. Short and scant urination indicates kidney deficiency; the Kidney Qi Pill is the main treatment, emphasizing the use of 桂 and Fuzi. </p>
<p>— Medical cases by Xue Shi [Ming, Xue Ji]<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br><strong>Suspended Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>For burning pain or fever, clear the liver and detoxify. If there is swelling and pain, focus on detoxifying. If there is swelling and pain with dark, turbid urine, it is due to damp-heat in the liver channel; one should promote urination and clear the liver. If there is no pus or no abscess, it indicates qi and blood deficiency; one should nourish them. </p>
<p>A suspended carbuncle is said to arise behind the pubic area and before the urinary tract, related to the deficiency of the three yin of the foot. If mild, it may lead to leakage, draining qi and blood until depletion; if severe, it may rupture internally, resulting in immediate danger. If it initially arises from damp-heat stagnation, producing pain without forming pus, or if there is stagnation in urination, use Longdan Xie Gan Decoction. If the swelling and pain are severe, use Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction with honey-prepared licorice as an assistant. In such cases, even if there is illness, it remains light, and if it ulcerates, it is shallow. </p>
<p>If pus cannot form or if the pus forms but does not rupture, use Bazhen Powder to tonify. If the pus has formed, treat urgently with needles. To promote muscle regeneration and contraction, if there&#39;s kidney deficiency, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan; for blood deficiency, use Sijunzi Decoction with additional ginseng and atractylodes; for qi deficiency, use Si Junzi Decoction with added chuanxiong and angelica; for spleen deficiency, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction; and for both qi and blood deficiency, use Bazhen Decoction or Shiquan Dabu Decoction. If cold and cool substances are used to detoxify, it would lead to complications. </p>
<p>The suspended carbuncle fundamentally stems from Yin deficiency of the liver and kidney channels, requiring supplementation. If not treated in the early stage, or if pus forms and is mistakenly attacked, what awaits is death! It is essential to treat early swelling and pain, or dark turbid urine by initially using honey-prepared licorice for one or two doses, followed by moxibustion with garlic, and further administering Longdan Xie Gan Decoction. If there is fever with swelling and pain, add Cheqianzi, Huangbo, chuanxiong, and angelica to Xiao Chaihu Decoction.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>When pus has formed, administer acupuncture. If it has already ruptured, use Eight Treasures Decoction with added licorice, as well as Chaihu and roasted Huangbo and Zhimu. For those with cloudy urine and a strong pulse, continue with Longdan Xia Gan Decoction, adding licorice. For those with cloudy urine and a weak pulse, use Qixing Lianzi Drink with added licorice. If the pus is clear and does not coalesce, use a major tonic formula, alternating with fermented soybean cakes. If it does not coalesce over time, also apply aconite cakes with moxibustion, and it will be effective.</p>
<p>If a boil arises in the waterway before and after consuming food, it is called a hanging boil. It occurs in the area before the anus and behind the scrotum, forming a lump resembling an olive or a plum. Initially, it is not painful, but over ten days it gradually becomes hot. If not treated early, the sore will rupture, and pus and blood will flow out in large amounts, leading to severe suffering akin to the intestines rotting with stools exiting through the sore. This can last for months, or even up to one or two years. It is essential to treat the lump before it becomes painful with licorice paste. After just one or two doses, it will dissipate on its own. This condition initially appears the size of a pine nut, gradually enlarging to the size of a lotus seed; after several days, it begins to swell red like peach or plum, and eventually bursts. If it bursts, it becomes difficult to treat. Although this medicine may not cause immediate disappearance, it will definitely resolve in over twenty days. Taking two doses poses no harm.</p>
<p>Generally, this condition pertains to yin deficiency, hence those who are deficient in essence are more susceptible. Cooling and cold medicines should not be overused, for fear of harming the stomach qi. Only licorice as an ingredient does not harm qi and blood nor disturb the organs, and its effects are quite swift.</p>
<p>As for toxins in the urine, if internal heat toxins are combined with external cold evils, disperse them. For those affected by labor, provide nourishment.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>If one fails to achieve harmony in the body and overly strengthens the essence, leading to the failure of the essence and its accumulation, this should be resolved. If it&#39;s caused by dampness and heat, clear the liver and guide out the dampness.</p>
<p>Bowel abscesses associated with the jueyin liver meridian involve internal heat and external cold, possibly due to overstrain, irregular sexual activity, unfulfilled desires, or strong retention of essence, or due to damp heat in the liver meridian. For treating internal heat and external cold, use the Shuangjie San; for overexertion, apply the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for irregular sexual activity, use the Liu Wei Wan; for unfulfilled desires, begin with Wu Ling San plus Da Huang to relieve the stagnation of essence, followed by Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys and strengthen the essence. If there is damp heat stagnation, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang is appropriate for guiding the liver and easing stagnation.</p>
<p>Bowel abscesses are essentially blood stagnation related to the jueyin liver meridian and its connecting vessels, as well as the channels of Chong, Ren, and Du. In women, this often manifests as swelling and pain in the lower abdomen or hard lumps, along with difficulty in urination. If treatment is done correctly and the patient is also able to regulate themselves, it should not be difficult to resolve. However, if large doses of Da Huang are used to eliminate heat from the body, or to force pus out through the bowels, leading to a loss of qi and blood, combined with carelessness regarding daily routines and diet, this will hinder recovery.</p>
<p>In general, bowel abscesses are blood stagnation. Commonly referred to as bowel toxins, it occurs at areas of difficulty, thus affecting the jueyin liver meridian and the channels of Chong, Ren, and Du, which are also secondary pathways of the liver. This is a blockage leading to swelling and pain, which is caused by heat toxins. Therefore, it is important first to relieve the stagnation, then apply medicines to clear and resolve. This is how to appropriately handle clinical situations.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br><strong>Abscess</strong></p>
<p>For swelling and pain that has not yet formed pus, disperse the liver and guide out dampness. For swelling that is hard and hot, clear the liver and reduce heat. For swelling that is painful and has formed pus, use urgent acupuncture, and then drink a detoxifying formula. If it has already burst, nourish yin and promote drainage. If the pus is clear and does not close, greatly supplement qi and blood. </p>
<p>An abscess is associated with yin deficiency and damp-heat descending in the liver and kidneys. If there is difficulty in urination, first relieve the toxicity with diuretics, then follow with yin tonics to enable self-resolution. If damp-heat recedes yet there is still swelling and pain, nourish yin and promote drainage to hasten pus formation. If pus is hot and there is constipation, it indicates heat and toxicity blocking. First use a detoxifying dispersing agent, then acupuncture to release it; once the pus is gone, symptoms will resolve. If the pus is gone but swelling and pain do not diminish, it indicates unresolved heat and toxicity, use a liver-clearing and nourishing decoction. </p>
<p>Dry mouth and frequent urination indicate kidney deficiency and heat; use Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills. Internal heat and afternoon fever indicate blood deficiency in the liver; use Four Substance Decoction with ginseng and atractylodes. If there is fatigue and decreased appetite, it indicates spleen qi deficiency with heat; use the Middle Strengthening Qi Decoction. If the pus is clear and watery, it indicates deficiency in both qi and blood; use a Complete Rejuvenating Decoction. Even with significant rupture and the testicles exposed, if treated appropriately, flesh can gradually grow back within ten days and recovery occurs. </p>
<p>However, if one focuses exclusively on the wound, the yin will become further deficient, leading to inability to manage swelling or healing; in the young and strong, this may result in chronic disease, while in the old and weak, it may lead to serious complications. There are also cases where prolonged hemorrhoids lead to abscesses, necessitating concurrent treatment for the hemorrhoids; avoid cold medicines as they impair the stomach&#39;s qi.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Lower Chancre</strong></p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain or fever, it is due to damp-heat in the liver channel; clear the liver and eliminate dampness. If there is swelling and pain with chills, it is due to evil qi attacking the surface; disperse it. If there is swelling, pain, and red, painful urination, it is due to damp-heat stagnating in the liver channel; promote liver function and guide out dampness. Lower chancres belong to the category of damp-heat descending in the liver channel, or they could be due to Yin deficiency and fire dryness. </p>
<p>Treatment: For swelling and pain with fever, it indicates blood deficiency with heat; use Si Wu Tang with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi. For swelling and pain with chills and fever, it indicates damp-heat in the liver channel; use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Long Dan Cao and Huang Lian. For swelling, pain, and frequent, painful urination, it indicates damp-heat stagnation; use Long Dan Xie Gan Tang. For swelling and necrosis, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood with fire; use Ba Wu Tang with Shan Zhi and Chai Hu.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>If there is great heat in the afternoon, it indicates deficiency of yin blood and the presence of heat; use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with ginseng, atractylodes, tang-kuei, and Angelica. If there is fatigue in the afternoon, it suggests that the yang energy is deficient and sinking; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For those who have not recovered for a long time and experience alternating chills and fever, it implies that kidney water cannot nourish liver wood; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If there are muscle contractions, accompanied by itching or pain, or if white fluid is present, this is tendon hernia; use Long Dan Cao Xie Gan Decoction. For those with qi deficiency, supplement with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding roasted gardenia and roasted gentian. For yin deficiency with fire heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If there is itching with white fluid coming from the stem, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction alongside Heart-clearing Lotus Seed Drink. This condition is fundamentally a yin deficiency in the liver, while symptoms like swelling, pain, and chills and fevers are secondary; Liu Wei Di Huang Wan should be used to nourish liver blood. In all cases where spleen earth deficiency cannot generate metal water, yet liver problems manifest, it is essential to aid with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and add Mai Men Dong to nourish the source of transformation.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>On Hernia</strong></p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; states that the Ren channel is the origin of the seven types of hernias, collectively termed as hernia syndromes. The so-called types are: Chong hernia, Fox hernia, Tai hernia, Jue hernia, Jia hernia, Gui hernia, and Gui stranguria, which detail the conditions of the seven hernias. The Chao family does not fully investigate the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; which originally contains the seven hernias; instead, they forcefully categorize cold, symptom, qi, band, attachment, and wolf hernia, mistakenly associating these with the seven hernias. Is this not absurd? Zhang Zihe rightly criticizes them, saying this is a misleading name established by ordinary practitioners. Their argument merely distinguishes the lower organs without any relation to the small intestine, bladder, and kidneys, yet it solely attributes disease to the liver channel. They completely fail to recognize that the Ren channel is the origin of the seven hernias, nor do they understand that the classic texts contain scattered references to the seven hernias within various discussions. They erroneously add cold, water, tendons, blood, qi, fox, and Tai as seven additional types; such flaws are not different from those of the Chao family. </p>
<p>If one argues that hernias stem from tendon diseases, it should be noted that they involve liver evils. If one merely states this is confined to the Jueyin channel, it contradicts the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; does it not? Furthermore, dealing with diseases located below by simply expelling them, without considering deficiency or excess, leads to generalized purging, and its associated dangers are beyond description. Can one expect vitality to be restored just by supplementing after purging? Students should regard the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; as the correct authority and should not be misled by myriad detours.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Danxi believed that all cases of hernia begin with damp-heat. When one overexerts, fire arises from the tendons; when one is drunk or overly full, fire arises from the stomach; when there is sexual exhaustion, fire arises from the kidneys; and when there is great anger, fire arises from the liver. If fire stagnates for long, dampness becomes excessive, turbid fluids congeal, merging into the blood channels and flowing to the Jueyin. The liver&#39;s nature is swift, constrained by cold, hence the pain is considerable. This, too, supplements a point not previously addressed by others and should not be rigidly held as a standard. Therefore, in terms of treatment, with cold there is much pain, with heat there is much movement, with dampness there is swelling and dragging, and with deficiency there is also swelling and dragging. In the blood phase, there is little movement, while in the qi phase, there is much activity. There are two testicles: the left one belongs to water, which generates wood in the liver; wood generates fire in the heart. All three sections govern blood, and the main source of the left blood is the liver. The right testicle belongs to fire, which generates earth in the spleen; earth generates metal in the lungs. All three sections govern qi, and the main source of the right qi is the lung.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>Therefore, when all cold is collected and withdrawn, the blood weeps and returns to the liver, infusing into the left testicle; when all qi is obstructed and stagnant, dampness accumulates and returns to the lung, infusing into the right testicle. Furthermore, the sinews connected to the testicles do not solely derive from the Jueyin, but also include those of the Taiyin and Yangming. Hence, in the case of left testicle afflictions, there is more pain and less swelling; in the case of right testicle afflictions, there is less pain and more swelling; this is certain. </p>
<p>The Seven Hernia Symptoms according to the Nest Clan: Jue hernia is characterized by reversed cold in the heart, leading to vomiting of food. Zhen hernia manifests as a sudden fullness in the lower abdomen causing pain, with qi accumulating like a swollen arm. Han hernia is due to cold beverages and food causing pain in the side of the abdomen. Qi hernia occurs with sudden fullness and relief, accompanied by pain. Pan hernia causes pain beside the navel. Fu hernia presents with accumulation of gas beneath the navel. Wolf hernia causes pain in the lower abdomen connected to the genitals, resulting in difficulty with bowel movements. </p>
<p>Xiaochang qi pertains to diseases of the small intestine. When the lower abdomen pulls on the testicles, it must connect to the waist and spine causing pain. If the small intestine is weak, wind and cold can invade, and once the pathogenic qi enters, it obstructs, violently affecting the liver and lung, pulling the testicles up and preventing them from descending. </p>
<p>Bladder qi refers to swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, with inability to urinate.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>For fox hernia, when lying down it enters the abdomen, and when standing it exits the abdomen. When Zhongjing treats fox hernia, he sometimes uses &quot;spider powder.&quot; There are those who use six liang of oyster, salt mud for solidification, three jin of charcoal, calcined until the fire is exhausted, taking two liang, and one liang of dry ginger, baked into fine powder. Mix these two ingredients, adjust with water, and apply to the painful area; if urination is impeded, it will cure.</p>
<p>As for hernia (with symptoms of testicular swelling), the scrotum swells to the size of a hand or a bucket, and in severe cases, as large as a gourd: use three-layered fennel pills, lychee kernel powder, Xuanbiao pills, and Rehmannia paste pills. If there is no pain in the kidney, use Nanshen, Banxia, Huangbo, Cangzhu, Zhishi, Hawthorn, Baizhi, Shenqu, Huashi, Zhuyu, and Kombu to make a wine paste pill and take with salt soup. For male mulberry leaves that do not seed, dry them into powder, make a wine paste pill, and take with salt soup. Additionally, use Verbena to pound and apply, it is effective.</p>
<p>For reversal hernia, the spleen is affected by liver evil, causing qi stagnation and accumulation.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>For those with severe liver imbalance, formulas such as Danggui Sijun Decoction, Chuan Kuliang Powder, and Muxiang Lianzi Powder are recommended. For those with masses and hernias, if there is heat and pain in the lower abdomen along with white discharge, these are symptoms of the hernia described by the Zhao family, related to the muscles described by Zihe. Danxi mentions that internal stagnation of damp-heat resembles this hernia; thus, Wutou Zhizhi Decoction can be used, possibly augmented with tangerine pits, peach kernels, or Wuzhuyu. Danxi states that when Yangming is affected by damp-heat, this can transmit to Taiyang, causing fever and chills, closed pain in the lower abdomen, and preparations including Zhizi, Tao Ren, Zhi Shi, and Hawthorn should be decocted together with fresh ginger juice. </p>
<p>For hernias considered as serious conditions, which are linked to Yangming muscle diseases and contain pus and blood within, this is similar to the attached hernia described by the Zhao family and the blood hernia by Zihe. Ingredients like peach kernels, Yanhusuo, licorice, Poria, Atractylodes, Zhi Shi, Hawthorn, tangerine pits, and lychee seeds should be used. </p>
<p>For cases of strangury hernia characterized by pus and blood and inability to urinate, add flavored Tongxin Powder or modify Wuling Powder with peach kernels and hawthorn. When qi ascends and disturbs the heart leading to obstruction of urination, symptoms may resemble those described by the Zhao family; it is advised to use Muxiang Powder.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods for Hernia</strong></p>
<p>For cold hernia, it is advisable to use warming agents, such as Yugong San or modified Wuling San with Qingmuxiang Wan, or similar remedies like Wuju and Pancong. For water hernia, use Yugong San, Sanhua Shenyuan Wan, or Daoshui Wan to expel water. For muscle hernia, use agents that reduce heart fire, primarily Xiexin Decoction. For blood hernia, it is best to use Yuzhu San, which is a blood-regulating remedy. For qi hernia, use qi-dispersing medicines, with Dangher Wan or Pancong San as the main treatments. For fox hernia, use agents that disperse stagnant qi. For (disease-causing) hernia, remedies to eliminate dampness should be applied, such as Sanhua or Shenyuan Wan. If the primal spirit is weak and subjected to cold, it may cause small intestine hernia with rolling pain; treat with Pancong San, adding Guozhi, Xiaohui, Chuanlianzi, and similar ingredients. If the body is robust but suffers from small intestine qi pain or difficulty in urination, use Bazheng San with Zhaoguozhi, Xiaohui, and Chuanlianzi.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Genitals</strong></p>
<p>The swelling of the genitals stems from the accumulation of heat in the bladder, compounded by wind and dampness; it may also result from damp heat flowing through, or from hernias causing turmoil; or from sudden wind and heat, and the crying of children, causing a buildup of anger; or from toxins blown in by insects. Carefully analyze the causes and apply the appropriate treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>If the hernia pulse is tight and urgent with a rapid rate, it indicates heat and pain. The classics state: &quot;The spleen transmits to the kidney, the condition is called hernia and lump.&quot; If there is discomfort and pain in the lower abdomen accompanied by white discharge, it is referred to as &quot;gu&quot; (a kind of malady). This indicates pain in the lower abdomen and discharge of white liquid. It could also be due to internal accumulation of guest heat, consuming fat and flesh, resembling the food of &quot;gu,&quot; hence it is named &quot;gu.&quot; However, the classics again assert that heat causes hernia and lump, which should not be mistaken for just cold; it must be discerned through pulse and symptoms. According to the &quot;Record of Discrepancies&quot;: whenever one sees a male with small intestinal hernia, the pain is unbearable, the scrotum is swollen and may sag to one side; during an episode, palpating the small intestine produces a sound like a frog, the shape resembles peach, plum, or papaya; if the mass rises, the face turns black, if it sags, it falls to the ground. The patient cannot endure the pain, and all doctors cannot discern its mechanism. Some say: &quot;Hernia originates from the liver meridian and has no connection with the kidney meridian,&quot; fearing it is an incomplete explanation. In truth, hernia primarily involves the liver, while the heart and kidney are secondary. The condition often arises from damp heat and anger damaging the liver, excessive sexual exertion causing stagnation in the heart and kidney, leading to the small intestine’s outer membrane being blocked with gathered qi, resulting in such a state. Some say: &quot;Using the heart and kidney as secondary, the excessive sexual exertion is only speaking of the kidney.&quot;<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>For example, when a child suffers from a tilt due to excessive sexual activity, how does this condition arise? It is said that the child inherits damp heat from the parents, which causes stagnation in the small intestine and results in the tilt, yet does not produce pain. During middle age, if sexual activity is excessive, it damages one&#39;s true essence, the protective energy becomes deficient, and the kidney pathogen rises, leading to recurring and unmanageable pain. In contemporary society, the treatment for cold pathogens or stagnation typically employs aromatic and drying substances, or utilizes da huang, qian niu, and ba shuang to hasten bowel movements, which ultimately harms the vital energy and exacerbates the illness. </p>
<p>I have consulted the principles regarding the small intestine, which holds more qi and less blood. If the heart qi becomes stagnant, the organs can suffer from pathogens; if liver qi thrives, then the offspring will also flourish. Thus, the two energies invade the small intestine and bladder, causing pain. The patient may find it bearable to touch the area but is unaware that the membrane gradually widens, and the qi becomes increasingly intense. Taking medication cannot avoid dietary restrictions, and as time passes and roots become deep, it&#39;s difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Commonly, the Wu Ling San is used with added qi-regulating herbs, showing many effective results, but rarely does it successfully expel the pathogen through urination. The properties of the herbs are such that Zhu Ling and Ze Xie balance yin and yang, harmonizing the heart and small intestine qi; Bai Zhu regulates the spleen and facilitates the removal of dampness and dead blood from the navel and waist; Fu Ling gently promotes the bladder&#39;s water; Gui can quell liver pathogens; Hui Xiang is good for treating small intestine qi; Jin Ling Zi and Ju Zi clear the bladder&#39;s qi; Bing Lang descends qi; and a small amount of Mu Tong is added to guide the small intestine&#39;s pathogens out. This has been repeatedly confirmed in practice. </p>
<p>The wood kidney represents stubborn damp heat, becoming hard and lump-like, yet it does not cause pain. The treatment should warm, disperse, and unblock to expel it.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about hernia: In ancient methods, some considered it a small intestine issue, while others viewed it as a bladder concern. However, only Zi He and Dan Xi specifically address it as related to the liver channel, which presents differing opinions. How can we distinguish among them? </p>
<p>The small intestine issue pertains to the disease of the small intestine; the bladder issue relates to the disease of the bladder; hernia is a disease of the liver channel. These three are certainly distinct. In ancient times, people mistakenly thought small intestine and bladder issues were hernias. Little did they know that the foot Jueyin channel encircles the reproductive organs and extends to the lower abdomen. When a person suffers from this condition, the swelling and pain in the testicles extending to the lower abdomen indicates that the hernia is associated with the liver channel. The small intestine issue, colloquially known as horizontal or vertical cord, travels around the navel and pains the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>The bladder&#39;s Qi is situated above the hairline, and the pain in the lower abdomen differentiates itself, bearing resemblance to hernia with visible form like a melon and a sound like a frog. However, it differs as to whether it rises in the abdomen or descends into the pouch. Yet the small intestine and bladder, due to the channels being connected to the Jueyin meridian, can also be affected by diseases related to the liver, which may cause pain that radiates down to the testicles; this is merely a disease of the two meridians and cannot be classified as a hernia. </p>
<p>Zhao Yide states: This entry originally established the name concerning the testicles. However, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; defines hernia as pain, referring to the pain of the internal organs in the abdomen, hence it is named after hernia, allowing for a generalized discussion here. The hernia of the five organs in the abdomen can thus be examined here. The pain of the testicles is said by the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; to be a disease of the Ren meridian, indicating that men internally suffer from seven hernias while women deal with discharges and masses. The Chong meridian is where the disease manifests, with inverted Qi causing urgency. However, the Ren meridian bears the name of seven hernias without exhibiting the form of seven hernias.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>Upon examining the various chapters, the double-character term is named &quot;taishan&quot; for a type of disease characterized by three types of Yang, manifesting in chills and fever, weakness, and numbness, passed on as &quot;taishan.&quot; Additionally, when the Yangming governs the heavens and the Yangming prevails over the liver, it causes movements that afflict the Yangming channels, leading to &quot;guishan.&quot; The term &quot;jueshan&quot; refers to a condition with a yellowish complexion, a large and weak pulse, excess gas in the abdomen, and a constricted feeling, called jueshan. &quot;Shanjia&quot; refers to the disease transmitted from the spleen&#39;s pathology to the kidneys, marked by pain in the lower abdomen, warmth, and discharge, also known as &quot;gu.&quot; The term &quot;chongshan&quot; describes a condition where disruption in the Chong, Ren, and Du channels leads to chest pain that does not allow movement forward or backward. &quot;Zushan&quot; arises when an exterior pathogen invades the Jueyin channel, resulting in acute pains that are distinct from the Jueyin and can lead to testicular pain. Lastly, &quot;guishan&quot; indicates a condition where the Jueyin&#39;s dominance causes a distended and obstructed pulse, while &quot;hushan&quot; refers to a disease arising from the liver.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>It is hardly possible to speak of this duality of names without considering the pathways of the Ren channel as they correspond to the various meridians, leading to the seven types of hernias. Furthermore, to mention only one type of hernia is to recognize the Taiyin channel at the Qian point, where excessive cold energy flows backward, potentially resulting in a hernia. The Yangming channel at the Qian point may cause pain in the lower abdomen, affecting the testicles and leading to heart pain; there is pain in the lower abdomen that hinders urination or defecation, termed a hernia due to cold. </p>
<p>In cases of the Foot Taiyin channel involved, there may be pain at the genital area that radiates upwards to the navel. A rapid pulse in the heart indicates a heart hernia, while the small intestine is the origin, associating with a notable presence in the lower abdomen. The kidney pulse being significantly rapid and slippery indicates a hernia, while a sliding and rapid heartbeat indicates a heart hernia, and a sinking pulse in the lungs corresponds to a lung hernia, with three Yin channels being linked to hernia occurrences. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that a fine and slippery heart pulse indicates a heart hernia, and the liver pulse being very slippery indicates a serious hernia.</p>
<p>The spleen pulse being slightly large indicates hernial qi, signifying large abscesses of pus and blood beyond the intestines; being excessively slippery suggests a significant hernia. A markedly slippery kidney pulse suggests a serious case as well. Slippery pulses indicate abundant Yang energy and slight heat. Hence, this signifies the seven hernias, centered around the disturbance of cold and heat within the body. The &quot;Neijing&quot; further states: a slippery Jueyin pulse results in fox hernia; a slippery Shaoyin pulse leads to lung wind hernia; a slippery Taiyin pulse results in spleen wind hernia; a slippery Yangming pulse indicates heart wind hernia; a slippery Taiyang pulse leads to kidney wind hernia; a slippery Shaoyang pulse signifies liver wind hernia. The term &quot;wind&quot; here is not referring to external pathogens but rather the internal dynamic-driven wind of the liver&#39;s wood element. Thus, the classics say that a sliding pulse indicates wind.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>The condition referred to as &quot;hernia&quot; occurs because the kidney and liver reside in the lower jiao together. The energy of the liver and kidneys flows in reverse, causing the yin energy of the ren channel to form a hernia, while the yang energy of the liver manifests as wind, hence it is referred to as &quot;wind hernia.&quot; Li Dongyuan states that a slippery pulse indicates that the fire of bing and ding is concentrated below, unable to withstand the cold water influences, leading to the formation of (hernia). This too is treated with heat. The Inner Canon does not strictly limit discussions to the pulse at the wrist; is it not due to external cold obstructing internal heat? It is said that heat transforms from cold, which may not be appropriate reasoning. The text further alludes to &quot;protrusions,&quot; related to the body&#39;s mechanisms, the states of yin and yang, and the pathways of fluids. When there is irregularity in diet, inappropriate emotions, or fluid overflow, leading to stagnation in the blood vessels and prolonged conditions, discomfort in movement can arise. This manifestation leads to a condition with retained water unable to ascend or descend, indicating another form of (hernia).<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>Zhang Zhongjing said that hernias are all caused by cold evils, which aligns with the assertion in the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; that when the pulse is tight, it should be warmed and dispersed. Someone asked: &quot;The &#39;Inner Classic&#39; states that hernias seem to arise from various meridians; why do you claim they belong entirely to the Ren meridian?&quot; He answered: &quot;The Ren meridian is the root source of hernia diseases, while the other meridians are the tributaries. Why do I say this? It is because, when speaking of the kidneys and their division into four regions, they belong to the cold water of the five elements, and when considering their position in the lower part, they are associated with the yin of the earth. The yin form is dual, hence there are two kidneys; their dual forms establish the rigidity and flexibility of the earth path. Encased between these two forms, they receive and emit the essence and blood of the kidneys, facilitating the transformation and generation of the earth, resulting in the myriad shapes and beings, as well as the growth and aging, and the essence that supports strength and skill—all are dependent on this.&quot;<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>However, the earth (Kun) stands in reverence, yet does not perform its duties. Those who perform these duties are the two vessels, Chong and Ren, which arise from within the womb and carry out their transformations. Thus, the channels of the five organs and six bowels all receive energy from the six vessels, hence they are referred to as the sea. Therefore, the two vessels are esteemed for their circulation and detested for their obstruction. When there is circulation, the yang energy of heaven descends and engages with it, leading to the flow of transformative principles; when there is obstruction, the yang of heaven is cut off, and as a result, the yin of the earth also becomes stagnant, leading to various diseases. Thus, hernias are caused by these two factors. For illnesses of the Ren vessel, if there is a struggle between yin and yang, or an invasion by external evils, both can cause an imbalance of yin and yang. When yin prevails, cold energy strikes; when yang prevails, heat energy enters, and when yin reacts from the outside, all these lead to issues with the Ren vessel and result in hernias. Even if the evil does not arise directly from the Ren vessel but initially derives from the energies received by each channel, it must still conflict with the Ren vessel.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>What are the offenses committed? Some may involve the meridians being transmitted through victories, or receiving without following the proper sequence, or the Ren meridian interacting with the evil of other meridians, or the six meridians receiving qi at certain times, carrying evil and affecting the Sea of Qi, all of which can stimulate the Ren meridian. This leads to a solid and unchanging accumulation of yin within, striking the organs and creating abdominal hernia, while descending and entering the Jueyin to meet with the genital area results in testicular hernia. Indeed, hernia has its own distinct name and solely pertains to the duty of the Ren meridian. It arises specifically from yang in the ground, being triggered by external factors. If other meridians receive evil and do not pertain to the Ren, it cannot be called hernia. Otherwise, why do the Inner Classic&#39;s Pain chapter and the Spiritual Pivot&#39;s chapter concerning the onset of diseases specifically elucidate the pains of the abdominal meridians without mentioning hernia? This clearly shows that the Ren meridian is the source of hernia disease. What the other meridians describe as hernia is merely their offshoots. As for the seven types of hernias described by the Cao clan—Jue, Zheng, Han, Qi, Pan, Fu, and Lang—along with their signs, they merely indicate that the accumulation of yin qi within, exacerbated by cold, disrupts the balance of Nutritive and Defensive qi, leading to weakened blood and qi, and thus cold air entering the abdomen results in hernia. In young children, hernia (or &quot;Gu&quot;) is often due to the swelling of the yin nucleus, caused by incessant crying and movement of yin qi, resulting from a gathering that does not disperse. Observing the five types of hernias, all manifest as pain in the heart and abdomen, while only the &quot;Gu&quot; hernia belongs to childhood ailments.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Later generations have elaborated on these teachings, further referencing the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; where it states that the spleen wind transmits to the kidneys, known as gu. In cases of hernia and abdominal pain, it is also termed gu disease. Additionally, there is a classification of yin hernia, which is (decaying) hernia, categorized into seven types. This refers to the treatments for pain in the heart and abdomen, which suggests: if harmed by the seven emotions, one should regulate qi and calm the five organs; if disturbed by external evils, one should warm and disperse it. Improper treatment can lead to the internal and external qi entering the kidneys, becoming kidney qi; entering the bladder, becoming bladder qi; and entering the small intestine, becoming small intestine qi. The kidney and bladder are one organ and one viscera, and their qi communicates with the outer kidney. The small intestine is linked to the testes; thus, they are interconnected. It is also said that yin hernia is another term for (decaying) hernia, with four varieties: intestine, qi, egg, and water. Zhang Dairen refuted this, stating that these are erroneous names introduced by common practitioners. This condition arises in the area of the yin organs, pressuring the lower abdomen, and belongs to the channel of the foot jueyin liver. It is a site vulnerable to hernia. Either due to cold water constraining, causing stagnation in this channel; or because of dry heat from heaven, with wood qi suppressed in this channel; or from anger, sorrow, and worry, which constricts the channel; or from external medications solidifying, closing off and constraining vitality in this channel. It does not involve the bladder, kidneys, or small intestines but is the responsibility of the jueyin liver channel. In general, hernia is not caused by the liver wood being attacked by evils; rather, it is a disorder of the liver wood itself. Hence, within the classification of yin hernia, seven types are defined: cold, water, tendons, blood, qi, fox, and (decaying).<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The text discusses the principles derived from the &quot;Inner Classic,&quot; &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; and &quot;Mingtang&quot; regarding the causes of hernia. It questions why they do not address the origins of diseases affecting the Ren (Conception) Vessel. This is because the issues concerning the Yin organs, small intestine, kidney, and bladder are not related, but stem from conditions affecting the foot Jueyin. This is clearly stated in previous discourse. The points of treatment for hernia often converge with the Ren Vessel. Furthermore, it mentions that the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels meet at the pubic bone, surrounding the Yin organs. Additionally, it states that excessive spermatic fluid resulting in sexual indulgence represents male hernia; while in women, symptoms like blood stagnation, absence of menstruation, heat in the lower back and knees, dry throat, and abdominal lumps indicate female hernia. However, women do not call it hernia but refer to it as &quot;jiā,&quot; suggesting a clear disease of the Ren Vessel.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>When the words of those who argue are rigid and focused solely on one aspect, they no longer consider the other. In conditions like (disease-related) hernias, there can be discernible external signs of the six meridians. If there are indeed symptoms associated with the bladder or small intestine, how could one ignore them? As the &quot;Lingshu&quot; states, a disease of the small intestine manifests as pain in the lower abdomen and pain that radiates from the lower back to the testicles; the treatment methods are likewise clear. Because the disease is in the lower body, one must first address the lower area, without needing to consider the fragile condition of individuals where treatment at both ends would not be appropriate. If one does treat the inappropriate areas, they may encounter untoward consequences, and can one simply wait until after treatment to then offer nourishment to bring back life? However, the texts of physicians are direct in their wording and clear in meaning, causing readers to feel enlightened and to dispel the obstructions in their minds; they are indeed the pinnacle of all medical texts. Yet, upon closer examination, one finds a lack of warmth and nuanced repetition in their ideas. Moreover, with the endless changes of yin and yang, diseases arise in countless forms, and treatment methods are also infinite—the insights of any one person are insufficient. Scholars should build upon what is already known and enhance their understanding of what is not, thus enabling them to effectively utilize these texts.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Mr. Danxi once discussed the sudden pain in the testicles connected to the lower abdomen, which may manifest as tangible or intangible, audible or inaudible. People often believe this is due to cold obstructing the meridians, causing pain. However, they do not realize that this ailment originates from damp heat, which, when stagnant for a long time, is further affected by external cold dampness and heat, leading to pain. The initial cause of damp heat arises from significant exertion, which raises fire in the heart; overindulgence or drunkenness raises fire in the stomach; excessive sexual activity raises fire in the kidneys; and extreme anger raises fire in the liver. When fire stagnates for too long, dampness increases, thick liquids congeal, and flow into the Jueyin (the outermost yin), affecting it. The liver is associated with wood, which is quick and vigorous, and fire nature is aggressive; thus, when bound by cold, pain intensifies and becomes acute. This reasoning also sheds light on the areas affected in Jueyin conditions, providing valuable insights for future scholars.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>The cause of hernia lies in these three types of evils: heat leading to swelling, cold resulting in pain, and dampness causing accumulation. Treatment must address the amount of each. When both testicles are affected, that is certainly the case. If there is a tendency towards one, I cannot disregard its significance. </p>
<p>The kidneys are paired, left and right. The left kidney is associated with water, which nourishes the liver wood; this wood generates the heart fire. These three are in charge of blood, with the liver wood managing the blood on the left. The right kidney is associated with fire, which nurtures the spleen earth, and the earth generates lung metal. These three govern qi, with the lung metal managing the qi on the right. </p>
<p>Thus, when cold constricts, it causes the blood to weep; hence, the cold blood returns to the liver, accumulating in the left testicle. When qi is obstructed, it results in dampness accumulation; thus, the damp qi returns to the lungs, accumulating in the right testicle. Moreover, the tendons connecting to the testicles are not solely from the jueyin channel, but also involve the taiyin and yangming channels. </p>
<p>It is often observed that individuals suffering more in the left testicle experience more pain with less swelling, while those afflicted more in the right have less pain and more swelling, which can be clinically verified.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p>
<h3>Suspended Carbuncle</h3>
<p>Suspended carbuncle occurs between the anterior and posterior yin, in the area of the perineum, specifically at the perineal acupoint. It belongs to the network of the Ren meridian and connects with the Du and Chong meridians. When a carbuncle develops in this location, it gives a feeling of suspension when one stands, hence the name &quot;suspended carbuncle.&quot;</p>
<h3>Bowel Poison</h3>
<p>According to &quot;Ghostly Inheritance&quot;: Bowel poison arises in the area beside the legs, underneath the tips of the buttocks, in front of the vagina and behind the urethra, forming a suspended carbuncle, all of which are extreme deficiencies. If it is close to the sides of the vagina, it is also known as hemorrhoidal carbuncle. It is advisable to urgently bolster the spleen and apply medicine at the site, specifically using hair acupoint powder; after rupture, apply pus-drawing ointment; when the pus is gone, use healing wound powder. Be cautious not to let it linger into winter, as it may become a cold leak, which is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Bowel poison develops in the area between the legs at the lower abdomen. Initially, there will be a mix of cold and heat with swelling and pain appearing between the legs. The kidneys are responsible for strength, holding the essence and wisdom; due to strong desires in both men and women that cannot be directly fulfilled, the essence deteriorates, merging with the blood and accumulating in the channels, forming bowel poison. This area is the pathway for the outflow of essence and energy. Sometimes, stimuli can trigger emotional responses; sometimes dreams linger without release, and when one fails to unite yin and yang, or cannot let go of emotions and thoughts, the essence and blood stagnate and lead to the formation of swellings and knots.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>At the onset, it is inappropriate to use cold and cooling medicines, for fear that qi and blood will become more stagnant and unable to circulate, ultimately leading to greater problems. Instead, one should open up stagnation and disperse qi, clearing away heat and toxins, so that vital essence and blood can flow freely, leading to natural recovery. </p>
<p>The previous discussion arises from boundless thoughts and unfulfilled wishes, yet the intent seems incomplete. If this reasoning holds true, many such ailments can be observed among monks, nuns, widows, and palace attendants, as well as among merchants and prostitutes who may inadvertently contract these diseases. Conditions like scabs or ulcers arise from fiery desires; once uncleanly engaged, the surge of lust opens the skin, allowing initial toxicity to enter. It is important to avoid purgatives at this stage. Why? The toxic evils do not enter if the system is not weak, and if stomach qi becomes weakened, the toxins will sink deeper, resulting in prolonged treatment without recovery. </p>
<p>The best approach is to induce sweating; next, promote urination, as pathogens affecting the skin tend to disperse easily. The penis and the inner thighs are closely linked to the liver meridian. The liver and kidneys govern the lower body, and the liver controls urination, allowing toxins to exit through the urine; thus, treatment aligns with natural processes. Consequently, results can be achieved within days. If sweating and urination have already been encouraged but the body remains heavy and the evils persist without release, then one should use remedies to break down toxins and invigorate blood flow, adjusting qi until the toxins are eliminated; subsequently, nourishing agents may be used, ensuring that the order of treatment is properly observed.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br><strong>Yinchang (Genital Sores)</strong></p>
<p>Genital organs belong to the liver channel of the foot Jueyin and are associated with the Ren (Conception) vessel. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: the Jueyin channel connects to the genital organs and is linked to the liver. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions: the muscles gather in the genital organs and are connected to the root of the tongue. The liver is where the muscles converge; it is also associated with the Du (Governing) vessel. The &quot;Suwen&quot; further states: the Du vessel has connections that circulate to the genital organs, uniting the lower parts. As for the foot Taiyang, it connects externally to the clear water and internally belongs to the bladder, facilitating the water pathways; the hand Taiyang connects externally to the Huai water and internally pertains to the small intestine, from which the water pathways emerge, thereby also linking to the hand and foot Taiyang. The kidney is the master of water, thus also linking it to the foot Shaoyin. When drinking enters the stomach, it overflows with essence and energy, upward to the spleen. The spleen’s energy disperses essence, which rises to the lungs, regulating water pathways and downward to the bladder, thus again connecting to the hand Taiyin. The &quot;Suwen&quot; further states that the front genitals gather the essence of the muscles, where the Taiyin and Yangming meet, thus linking to the spleen and stomach. When sores occur, one must be careful to investigate the underlying causes; it is improper to focus solely on the Jueyin liver channel and merely clear the liver and guide away dampness, as this would lead to regret. </p>
<p>Hidden itching resulting in sores, accompanied by symptoms such as tinnitus, itchy eyes, redness of the nose, floating teeth, and white between fingers, indicates kidney wind. Sores that arise on the head of the penis are referred to as head sores, while those at the orifice are considered lower sores. If sores arise solely on the penis, they are all categorized as lower sores.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br><strong>Mao&#39;s Jiyang</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks about severe itching below the lower abdomen, at the root of the jade stalk, where hot water is poured and it temporarily subsides but then recurs, with three or four openings seeping yellow fluid, what is the diagnosis? It is said: this is a wide sore caused by accumulated poison. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that there was a history of sores in childhood. After ten days, severe pain and swelling occurred, with little food intake, leading to the treatment of the accumulated poison.</p>
<p><strong>Examination of Medical Formulas by Wu Kun in the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seven Types of Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Hernia is a concealed ailment with seven types, each having aspects of deficiency and excess. I have examined seven formulas, indicating the seven types of hernia. If there is a distinction between deficiency and excess, it relies on the adaptive changes in the individual. Cold hernia causes lower back pain, pulling the testicles, where they bend but do not extend, with a slow and deep pulse at the inner wrist; for this, the formula of Wu Zhu Yu with Fu Zi is prescribed. The seven hernias are: cold, water, tendon, blood, qi, fox, and (illness of decay). </p>
<p>The cause of cold hernia is external cold affecting the lower body, as if sitting in cold and wet conditions. Cold air enters from outside, constraining the lower fire and depressing liver energy, which leads to back pain. The pain pulling the testicles corresponds to the liver meridian connected to the genital area. Cold nature restricts, hence they bend but do not extend. The inner wrist governs below the waist, with a slow pulse indicating deficiency, confirming the presence of cold. Therefore, the warming qualities of Wu Zhu Yu and Fu Zi are used to address the cold, along with ginger and jujube which harmonize the qi. After the obstruction is removed, deficiency must be strengthened, thus ginseng is utilized to counteract the deficiency. </p>
<p>For water hernia, it is a condition of kidney cysts with persistent lower body sweating; for this, the formula to raise the yang and eliminate dampness is prescribed.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>Zi He said: Regarding water hernias, they are caused by drinking excessive water or liquor, and by exerting oneself internally, which aligns with reason. Drinking water and liquor leads to an excess of dampness, and exertion exhausts kidney energy. When kidney energy is weak, dampness prevails and causes flow issues, resulting in kidney cysts that swell like crystals and leak like a drip. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;What descends should be lifted.&quot; It also states: &quot;Wind can overcome dampness.&quot; </p>
<p>The formula includes Chai Hu, Qiang Huo, Cang Zhu, Fang Feng, Sheng Ma, Gao Ben, Man Jing Zi, and Du Huo, all of which are pungent in flavor and uplifting in nature. Thus, they can overcome dampness and elevate yang. Meanwhile, the sweet properties of Huang Qi can help support and lift the descending energy, the warmth of Gan Cao can help nurture the water-holding earth, and the moisturizing property of Dang Gui can help regulate the nourishing blood among the damp dispelling herbs. Wei Ling Decoction can also be used appropriately.</p>
<p>For external kidney damage leading to swelling of the testicles and occasional pain, there may be stagnant blood, known as blood hernia. It is advisable to use massage techniques, as detailed in guiding methods. </p>
<p>For muscle hernias, the main treatment is a decoction of Gan Cao and black beans. Muscle hernias manifest with pain in the tendons, causing bulging discomfort. Zi He stated that this results from improper methods. Improper methods refer to practices akin to springtime bedroom techniques. Therefore, treatment should focus on detoxification and relief, hence utilizing Gan Cao and black beans as the primary ingredients.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>In the case of qi hernia, when there is emotional distress, the testicles swell, but when in sorrow, they shrink without medication. The treatment is with Hu Qian Wan. This occurs because evil qi accumulates and often takes advantage of a deficiency. When emotional distress leads to swollen testicles, it is the liver qi taking over the deficiency of the kidneys. Sorrow that vanishes without treatment indicates a release of qi. The diseases of the liver and kidneys can be treated similarly, thus herbs like Zhi, Bai, Shu Di, Shao Yao, Niu Xi, Dang Gui, and Suo Yang, which have rich properties, can nourish both the kidneys and liver. The tortoise absorbs the thickest yin energy of heaven and earth, while the tiger draws the most potent yin energy; by combining yin elements found within the blood and qi, we aim for a mutual attraction. Dried tangerine peel is used for its ability to dispel stagnant qi, while lamb is chosen to nourish the yang of the five organs. If asked why we do not use the likes of tangerine seeds, trifoliate orange fruit, spicy finish, prickly ash seeds, or green skin, I would say these are all qi-breaking herbs. In the past, doctors frequently used them, but they only addressed the symptoms and ignored the warnings against further depleting a deficiency. Such herbs can be used for qi excess. </p>
<p>As for fox hernia, during the day, the qi escapes, causing the kidney to swell, which is unbearable. At night, the qi re-enters, and the swelling diminishes, leading to a sense of relief.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>To supplement the center and benefit qi, use a formula containing Huangbo and Zhimu decoction. The treatment should cease once the illness is cured. The fox is known to emerge from its burrow to relieve itself during the day, and returns to its burrow without doing so at night. This demonstrates the phenomenon of the fox&#39;s hernia, hence it is named as such. Day represents yang; night represents yin. If there is illness during the day but not at night, it indicates a problem with qi, while blood remains unaffected. Therefore, ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, and licorice are used to benefit qi. If the formula also includes Shengma and Chaihu, it can elevate the sinking yang; if it has Huangbo and Zhimu, it can nourish the insufficient yin. Angelica has a spicy flavor, which can invigorate the stagnant blood; aged tangerine peel has a fragrant qi, which can help eliminate the staleness. Some may ask why we do not prioritize aromatic qi-moving agents. I would say: the initial cause of the illness is due to insufficient qi. To then treat it with qi-moving agents would not only be unhelpful but detrimental.</p>
<p>As for the (stomach) hernia, this is a chronic condition. Even if the testicles are large, there is no pain or suffering involved. This condition is inherited from parent to child and has existed since life began; it is not like an illness caused by the three postnatal factors, thus there is no need for treatment. If there was a prior (stomach) hernia that later developed pain and discomfort, then it involves the earlier six signs, and treatment should refer back to the earlier method.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br><strong>Surgical Authenticity [Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wind of the Kidney Cyst</strong></p>
<p>The wind of the kidney cyst is caused by wind and dampness from the liver meridian. It manifests as itching, with a tendency to be soothed by hot baths. In severe cases, it results in hard lumps that break open and ooze watery fluid. It is advisable to use a decoction of snake bed seeds for fumigation and washing; usually after two applications, it will recover.</p>
<p><strong>Crabs of the Groin</strong></p>
<p>Crabs of the groin, also known as eight-legged insects, arise from the turbid energies of both the liver and kidney meridians, representing an inauspicious condition. It is recommended to use Ginkgo leaf powder to adjust the affected area; internally, taking Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills, adding one tael of honey-fried Coptis to each pound, and five qian of aloe to clear the origins, ensures recovery without recurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Chancre</strong></p>
<p>Lower chancre is caused by the stagnation of lustful heat. There are three origins: First, due to the activation of desire in men, when the genital organs become aroused and lustful heat runs rampant without release, leading to the deterioration of seminal fluid and stagnant blood which then solidifies into a swelling. Second, from women where residual seminal fluid and turbid energies remain unclean after sexual intercourse, leading to the transmission of polluted essence. Third, from sexual practices involving heated medicines, applied to the genitals, stirring up yang fire and arousing yin essence—if the activity continues without release for a prolonged period, it often results in stagnation of heat and delayed eruption. </p>
<p>In men, early signs of manifested fire include frequent, painful urination, followed by the release of yellow, turbid fluid and gradual loss of vitality, leading to severe swelling, pain, and even corruption.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>The method should focus on clearing the liver and kidney of excessive fire, such as formulas like Ba Zheng San and Qing Gan Dao Zhi Tang. For women, if the reproductive organs are unclean, it may initially present as swollen skin that is shiny and might appear like crystal; if severe, the skin may break and drain fluid, with increasing swelling and pain, and intermittent itching and numbness. Treatment should aim to detoxify and dispel wind, using a combination of Long Dan Xie Gan Tang and Ping Wei San. </p>
<p>For men and women injured during intimate relations, which can lead to toxicity, it may initially manifest as itching and pain in the affected area, hard and purple lesions gradually appearing, and eventual necrosis; this is often accompanied by bleeding and discharge without resolution. Treatment should focus on clearing fire and detoxifying, using formulas such as Huang Lian Jie Du Tang and Aloe Vera Pills. </p>
<p>Externally, silver powder, pearl powder, and human placenta powder can be selectively used. Additionally, for lesions that arise first, it is advisable to apply medicinal sticks to the affected area and address the toxicity specifically. </p>
<p>One should observe and assess accordingly.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>At the onset, there is no redness or swelling, the erection does not occur, and the jade stem is slightly damaged, with mild urination. Once it develops, there is mild heat and swelling, the skin appears bright, the urine is red, especially if there&#39;s also a cloudy discharge. If it becomes worse, the flesh appears red and active, with heat and hardness, no pain in urination, and no constipation, it is easier to treat. At the initial stage, if urination is dripping and there is damage to the masculine essence, with hardness causing pain and gradual decay, it is dangerous. Once it develops, if there is internal decay attacking the jade stem, it turns purple without pus, with pain like being pricked by needles, it is a severe condition.</p>
<p>Treatment methods:<br>At the onset, with swelling, pain, heat, and obstructed urination indicating damp-heat in the liver channel, it is advisable to drain the liver and resolve dampness. If there is swelling, pain, hardness, alternating cold and heat, dry mouth and throat, and constipation, one should promote urination. For swollen and painful jade stem, with urination like drizzling, spontaneous or night sweats, and occasional hematuria, nourish the heart and benefit the kidneys. For itching in the urinary passage, with occasional cloudy discharge, heat, dry mouth, and insufficient fluids, tonify the kidneys and clear the heart. After ulceration and swelling, with red and dripping urine, feeling calm during the day but painful at night, nourish yin and drain fire. If the decay continues, swelling and hardness recur, pain intensifies daily, with foul odor not subsiding, clear the liver and detoxify.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br><strong>Fish Mouth and Venom</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;fish mouth&quot; refers to the left side associated with the fish and the right side linked to venom. This condition arises when vital energies and blood intersect and become congested, forming swelling between the two hips. Near the lower abdomen, within the pubic hair, the swelling is termed as the “horizontal tumor” or “external hernia.” </p>
<p>This condition occurs when one resists the release of semen during intimacy, resulting in the suppression of vitality and a failure of release, which causes the vital energies and blood to become stagnant, clumping together to form a swelling. The treatment should aim to disperse the stagnation and promote the flow of both large and small intestines. Medicines such as Nine Dragon Dan and the inner essence of the pangolin are effective for dissipation. After seven days of use, the foundation becomes solid. </p>
<p>To prevent purulence, it is advisable to utilize fire needle therapy for puncturing, which is also effective. For cases where pus has already emerged, taking a comprehensive tonic is recommended to aid in consolidation; delaying treatment may result in the emergence of other complications that are harder to resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong><br>At the beginning, when swelling is not red, slightly warm, and there is mild ease of movement without signs of cold or heat, it is considered mild. Once developed, if it becomes red, swollen, painful, hot to the touch, and movement is difficult, particularly worsening at night, it is serious. If it has erupted, and the pus is thick, with flesh appearing red and vibrant, the swelling subsides and pain ceases, indicating a favorable recovery with the possibility of itchiness as new flesh forms.</p>
<p>Initially, the swelling feels as hard as stone, with sharp pain and discomfort when sitting, indicating severity with accompanying chills. If it has ruptured, and the flesh is necrotic with persistent pain, and the pus is clear and thin with a deep hole that does not seal, it is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong><a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>At first, there is a swelling and pain, tension in the hips, chills and fever; it is advisable to disperse the evil in the exterior. Once it has developed, it becomes hard and hot, with internal heat and pain, dryness of the mouth, and constipation; it is necessary to promote bowel movements. After dispersing and alleviating, if the swelling and pain persist, desiring it to form pus, one should use methods to detoxify. If the swelling and heat persist for a long time, causing extreme pain and urgent distension, and internal pus has formed, one should quickly drain it. After it has burst, if the pus does not dry up and new flesh grows slowly, one must nourish the spleen and stomach, and replenish qi and blood.</p>
<p>Regarding sac edema, it is caused by yin deficiency and damp-heat, flowing into the sac, resulting in swelling. After it ruptures, if the testicles hang, it should not cause harm, as the poison comes from outside. Treatment should be to tonify yin and clear damp-heat; efficacy is observed in 80-90% of cases. Recently, people have mistakenly used heat medications for hernias, leading to excessive heat and pus, making recovery difficult. It is advisable to start with Long Dan Cao (Gentian) decoction to clear liver heat, then after some time nourish yin and disperse; applying Ruyi Jin Huang powder externally may also help internally. </p>
<p>There is another type of water hernia, with shiny skin, no heat or redness, swollen and painful, and sometimes a hollow sac gathers water; one should use a needle to draw out the water from the appropriate area for relief. If the swelling and pain persist for a long time and internal pus has formed, one may quickly puncture it. Internally, one can take Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction) with additions like Shan Zhu Yu (Cornelian Cherry) and Mu Dan Pi (Peony) and Ze Xie (Alisma) for treatment, alternating with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia); this would also help in recovery.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>At the onset, there is slight redness and swelling, with pain radiating from the kidneys, but no chills or fever; those who can move about freely are considered mildly affected. Once developed, there is marked redness, swelling, and heat, with the body appearing bright; pain occurs intermittently, and those who still enjoy food are seen as stable. After it has burst, with thick pus and reduced swelling, pain ceases, and new flesh gradually grows, with any itching considered a positive sign. If it begins to rot, with layers of skin peeling away, and in severe cases, the testicles protruding, those who can still eat without pain are deemed manageable.</p>
<p>Initially, it presents as hard and purplish, with severe pain day and night, difficulty urinating, and diarrhea being serious indicators. Once developed, it remains hard without rupture, with necrotic areas showing no pus, pain occurring consistently, and continuous bleeding considered critical. After bursting, if the pus opening enlarges, with persistent swelling and pain, accompanied by chills and fever, and restless sleep, the situation is perilous. </p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>At the onset, with alternating chills and fever, swelling and pain in the kidneys, and pain radiating to the lower abdomen, it is advisable to disperse the cold pathogen. If it has progressed to redness, swelling, fever, dry mouth, burning pain, difficulty in urination, and constipation, treatment should focus on relieving it. Once it has ulcerated, if the pain does not diminish and the pus is clear and thin, with chills in the morning and fever in the evening, one should nourish the yin to support the interior. After ulceration, if one cannot contain it, experiences evening fevers, and has reduced appetite, one should nourish the blood and strengthen the spleen. After ulceration, if the testicles hang and cannot be retracted, one should apply topical treatments to promote healing while nourishing internally.</p>
<p>A suspended abscess is due to the deficiency of the three yin and the accumulation of dampness and heat. This condition is located in front of the valley passage and behind the genitalia, also known as the &quot;sea bottom point.&quot; In the early stage, it resembles a lotus seed, with slight itchiness and considerable pain; over time, it gradually takes on the form of a peach or plum, red and swollen, with burning pain, and appears ready to burst and release pus. After rupture, if it is mild, it may become a chronic leakage; if severe, it may deplete vital energy and blood, leading to conditions that are difficult to recover from. At the onset, when the vital energy is robust, it is advisable to use Nine-Dragon Pill to purge the disease; if slightly deficient, one may use Nourishing Snow Decoction to eliminate dampness and heat, which can also be effective, with a success rate of about 30-40%. If, after ten days or so, the swelling has become significant and internal purging is not effective, it is advisable to use a decoction for detoxification with ingredients like pangolin scale and soapberry thorn, which can help it rupture naturally.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>If there is a swelling that is high and shiny, with pus that is ripe yet not ruptured, promptly puncture it with a needle; once the foul pus is expelled, the affliction will be easily relieved. After the pus has been released, take Liuwei Dihuang Wan in the morning, and in the afternoon, take Shiquan Dabu Tang with added Danpi and Zexie to warm and nourish yin. If the individual has a robust physique and consumes rich foods, initially take Longdan Xiegan Tang, and after the condition has ruptured, switch to Zi Yin Bawuzhong Tang to clear the gathered heat. In cases where the person is thin and worn down, with weak qi and blood, start with Bajin Tang, adding Zexie and processed licorice; after rupture, shift to Shiquan Dabu Tang with added Danpi and熟附子. For those with spleen weakness, take Buzhong Yiqi Tang to nourish the source of digestion. For long-standing conditions that have developed into a leakage, administer Guolao Gao for internal consumption, along with wax and aluminum pills. Consistently using cold and cooling treatments can harm the stomach and spleen, causing stagnation of qi and blood, which may lead to a gradual opening of the condition, with foul pus that does not cease, ultimately transforming into a debilitating consumption disease that is difficult to cure.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>Initially, it appears like a pine nut; gradually, it grows larger like a plum. When it is red, swollen, painful, and feels hot and bright, it is mild. Once formed, it becomes high and swollen, causing pain with roots that do not disperse—thin skin that is easily broken, and pus that has formed with swelling and pain is serious. Once it has ruptured, the pus is thick and yellow, with no foul smell; the swelling dissipates easily, and when the pain turns to itching, it is favorable. At the initial stage, the color is purple and hard, the roots are diffusely swollen, and the pain connects to the hips and knees, leading to difficulty in urination and defecation, indicating severity. Once formed, it swells like a cucumber, with purple spots rotting, foul water but no pus, and if the pain is severe with a foul odor, it is difficult. Once it has ruptured, there is an endless flow of foul pus, the wound opens wide, the flesh is not red and alive, and if there is virtual heat with little appetite, it is unfavorable.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods</strong><br>At the onset, with cold and heat resembling malaria, they enjoy being covered with clothes and blankets, have a dry mouth, and prefer drinking hot soup, which suggests dispersal. Once formed, with heat causing pain, internal heat, a dry mouth preferring cold, and constipation, one should apply a mild purgative. If, over time, there is internal pus formed but not ruptured and the swelling is painful, one should quickly use a needle; the method should favor tonification. After rupture, if the pus is clear and thin, with no retreat of virtual heat and persistent swelling and pain, it is advisable to nourish Yin and strengthen the spleen. If the wound does not close, and there is a reduction in appetite, lingering swelling, and new flesh not growing, one should sharply tonify the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise on Diseases</strong><br><strong>by Yu Chang (Qing Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Hernia</strong>  </p>
<p>When treating edema, if there is a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and one rashly engages in outward therapies or attacks the interior, it can cause the patient to experience turbid qi rising to the chest and stomach, resulting in severe vomiting and rebellious qi, with pain radiating to the genitals. Such cases can lead to sudden death without rescue; it is the fault of the physician. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; abdominal pain with a tight, wiry pulse indicates that defensive qi is not circulating, leading to aversion to cold. A tight pulse signifies a lack of appetite. When the evil and the upright qi clash, it results in cold hernia. Cold hernia presents as pain around the navel; when it manifests, it results in spontaneous sweating and cold extremities. If the pulse is deep and wiry, apply a decoction of major aconite. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Neijing,&quot; any area in the abdomen where there is pain from a mass can be referred to as hernia, not limited to the area between the testicles. However, in the case of cold hernia with navel pain, the pulse shows a strong yang and a weak yin; the strong yang leads to an inability of defensive qi to circulate, resulting in aversion to cold, while the weak yin indicates that cold in the stomach is too potent to expel food. </p>
<p>The evil refers to the yin pathogen in the stomach, while the upright refers to the yang qi therein. This analysis involves both the essence of water and food in the stomach, as well as the noxious gas from these substances, and all are part of upright qi. If cold enters the nutritive aspect and clashes with the defensive aspect, then the nutritive aspect becomes the evil, while the defensive aspect remains the upright. </p>
<p>Pain around the navel, spontaneous sweating, and cold extremities, alongside a weak yang and strong yin, signal a critical condition. Therefore, using the warmth of aconite, combined with the sweetness of honey, to nourish the stomach strengthens the internal environment and alleviates the situation, allowing the yang within the defense to flourish and preventing the evil in the nutritive aspect from remaining. It also prevents the subtle threat of deficient cold rising from below.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br><strong>Volume 200 of the Comprehensive Collection of Books on Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Yin Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jingyue&#39;s Complete Book</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jieben)</p>
<p><strong>Impotence of Male Organs</strong></p>
<p>For men with impotence and inability to maintain an erection, it often results from the decline of fire at the life gate, a deficiency of vital energy and coldness. This may also be due to excessive emotions and fatigue, which damage the vitality of yin, commonly leading to this condition. There are also cases where excessive damp-heat weakens the fundamental channels, resulting in impotence. Just as extreme heat can cause all things to wither, it is described in the classics that strong fire absorbs energy, which is indeed applicable here. However, whether there is fire or not can be differentiated by pulse and symptoms; indeed, the majority show deficiencies in fire, while only a few exhibit excess fire.</p>
<p>Excessive worry and labor, and too much melancholy, can also lead to impotence. The essence of yin and yang converges in the fundamental channels, with yang being the predominant force. These fundamental channels are the pathways of vital essence, and the essence is inherently the source of the channels. If excessive worry and thought oppress the heart and spleen, it affects the Yangming channel, inevitably leading to the depletion of food and energy, causing vital energy to become insufficient and thus the yang path will not be vigorous. The classics say: the disorders of the two yang affect the heart and spleen, leading to a lack of hidden vitality, such as with women missing their monthly cycle, which refers to this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, persistent shock and fear can also lead to impotence. The classics state that fear harms the kidneys, which is relevant here. Therefore, when one experiences a sudden fright, it can result in involuntary urination, demonstrating that the kidneys have been affected.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>At times of旺盛阳气, if there is sudden fear, the yang path will become impotent; this is also a sign. When the fire of the life gate is weak, and there is deficiency of essence and coldness leading to impotence, it is advisable to use remedies like Right Return Pill, Zanyu Pill, or Stone-Carved Kidney-Calm Pill. If the fire is not greatly diminished and is simply due to weak blood and qi, then Left Return Pill, Dragon Spot Pill, or Whole Deer Pill should be used. </p>
<p>For those whose excessive thinking and fear have led to kidney depletion and impotence, it is essential to cultivate the heart and spleen to gradually nourish the stomach qi, so that circulation and the function of元阳 can be restored. Remedies like Seven Blessings Drink or Spleen Return Decoction are suitable. However, it is crucial to have a relaxed and open mind to ease the spirit, otherwise the medicinal effects will be of no benefit. For those excessively burdened by worry and fear, they often suppress the yang qi; if fire is not increased, there will be no vitality, and it is advisable to use Seven Blessings Drink with added cinnamon, aconite, or wolfberry.</p>
<p>If there is damp heat in the liver and kidneys causing relaxation of the meridians, this too results in impotence. Treatment should focus on clearing fire to strengthen the kidneys, but it is necessary to have fire symptoms that internally and externally correspond to this condition. Remedies like Nourishing Yin Eight Flavor Pill, or Danxi Great Nourishing Yin Pill, and Tiger Crouch Pill are suitable. If there is excessive fire, Nourishing Kidney Pill or Great Nourishing Pill can also be used.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Hernia refers to conditions where the lower abdomen or testicles are swollen or painful at any time. However, the symptoms of hernia vary. For example, as mentioned in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the fox hernia is characterized by irregularity in its appearance; the stubborn hernia is marked by persistent swelling and lack of sensation; the upward hernia is characterized by pain radiating from the lower abdomen upwards; the obstructive hernia is due to stagnant energy in the public region causing reversals; the painful hernia involves heat in the lower abdomen with symptoms of white discharge, also known as &quot;gu&quot;; and the wind hernia according to seasonal theories is also included. There’s also the intestinal hernia discussed in relation to pathogenic influences on organs. All these seven conditions represent different aspects of hernia. Furthermore, hernia is not only a male affliction; women also suffer from it. The text mentions that stagnant energy in the abdomen can lead to what is called obstructive hernia, applicable to women as well. It is also discussed that the term &quot;obliterated&quot; in relation to the obstructive hernia refers to swelling in the lower abdomen of women.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>As for conditions like hernias and lumps, they affect both men and women alike. However, diseases of the testicles are exclusively male, and all others should be carefully examined. Looking at Zhang Zi&#39;s words: involuntary urination, urinary obstruction, impotence, and seminal discharge are ailments of men. If blood is stagnant and there are monthly issues, heat in the lower back and knees, leg weakness, dry throat, urinary obstruction, and masses in the lower abdomen, or if there are protrusions in the front or hemorrhoids in the back, these pertain to women. Women do not refer to hernias as &quot;seven hernias,&quot; but rather as lumps. If a young person develops these issues, whether man or woman, they may remain childless. This is indeed not incorrect. However, people today only speak of hernias in men and are entirely unaware of those in women, which is a significant oversight. </p>
<p>Hernial conditions do not belong to a single principle. As stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: the Ren meridian is associated with illness, where men can develop seven hernias, and women may experience discharge and lumps. The Du meridian causes pain from the lower abdomen to the heart, manifesting as a hernia that cannot advance or retreat, which is termed &#39;冲疝&#39; (chong hernia).<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>It is also said: the spleen transmits to the kidney, and the illness is called hernia. It is further stated: the three yang manifest as cold and heat, which transmits as hernia. It is said: if the evil resides in the small intestine, it connects to the testicular system and belongs to the spine. Furthermore, if the evil lodges in the meridian of the foot&#39;s jueyin, it causes sudden sharp pain from hernia. Likewise, the pulses of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys each have their distinctions regarding hernia. This is mentioned in the &quot;Suwen,&quot; discussing hernia of various meridians. Other texts, such as the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; discuss the leg&#39;s yangming sinews, with the illness manifesting as severe abdominal pain from hernia; the leg&#39;s taiyin sinews present with pain in the yin organs, extending down to the navel, with pain in both sides; the leg&#39;s jueyin sinews result in dysfunction of the yin organs, among other such meanings, which is articulated in the &quot;Lingshu&quot; regarding hernia of the meridians. From Zhang Zihe, it is stated: there are seven types of hernia. Many earlier scholars have discussed this. I do not accept views that are not from the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; &quot;Suwen,&quot; or &quot;Tongren.&quot; I cite the discussion from the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; stating: the sinews of the foot&#39;s jueyin converge at the yin organs, hence the sinews of yangming and taiyin all converge at the yin organs.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>The liver governs the tendons, and therefore, for conditions like hernia, one must consider it to be related to the liver. This view holds that hernia is a tendon disease, and since tendons are governed by the liver, it seems reasonable to conclude that hernia must originate in the liver. However, this is not entirely correct. Observing the various discussions in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; those views are not attributed to the &quot;Ling&quot; or &quot;Su,&quot; and should they be dismissed entirely? Moreover, although tendons are governed by the liver, they are mentioned throughout the classics, thus forming part of the classical understanding. If a disease presents in various meridians, can it truly be attributed solely to tendons? Furthermore, as discussed in the texts, the front yin is where tendons converge, uniting the Taiyin and Yangming. Additionally, the discussion on atrophy state mentions that yin and yang fundamentally meet at the tendons, with Yangming being predominant. Can such statements also be ignored? Therefore, considering the meridians in the lower abdomen, they involve the Jueyin, Shaoyin, Taiyin, Yangming, Shaoyang, and Taiyang, as well as the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians, all of which are engaged. Now, if we examine the treatments for hernia in the &quot;Copper Man Classic,&quot; each of the meridians has acupoints assigned for treatment. If one argues that treatment pertains only to the Jueyin, then all other meridians would be deemed irrelevant.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>Zihe also pointed out the acupoints in the various channels, stating that although these points can treat hernias, they are ultimately not the places where hernias arise. What does this mean? Later, Danxi followed Zihe’s words and claimed that there are seven types of hernias: cold, water, tendon, blood, qi, fox, and (decay of the sick). He asserted that they primarily belong to the liver channel and have no connection to the kidney channel. Furthermore, Dai Yuanli, influenced by Danxi, said hernias belong to the liver of the Jueyin channel. I have often seen popular beliefs that the gas of the lower parts of the small intestine and bladder are mere nonsense. Alas! Such discussions are mere speculations by later scholars; can they truly be trusted? Can they validly serve as a guide? The medical profession has lost its true teachings, and many share this fate. Therefore, unless it is the words from &quot;Ling,&quot; &quot;Su,&quot; or &quot;Bronze Man,&quot; I sincerely do not dare to take them as authoritative.</p>
<p>The illness of hernia qi can present both cold and heat symptoms. Yet it must stem from an initial exposure to cold and dampness or from encountering cold substances, leading to the accumulation of pathogenic factors in the yin areas. This is the root cause, as there is none that arises without being related to cold and dampness. Once the illness persists, there are those whose stagnant condition transforms into heat.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>Some people with excess yang in their organs may suffer from the gathering of fire due to pathology, which is accompanied by damp heat. Therefore, in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; both cold and heat are discussed regarding hernias. For instance, it states: when the illness is in the lower abdomen, with abdominal pain and inability to pass urine or stool, it is called hernia, caused by cold; it also mentions that when yin is excessive and the pulse is distended and obstructed, it is referred to as hernia due to (the grip of) the illness; it is said that liver and spleen may be affected by cold dampness, treated in the same way as hernia; it notes that when the Yangming, Taiyang, and Taiyin are overstimulated, there may be hernia, which all points to the cold aspect of hernias. Furthermore, when it mentions that spleen wind transmits to the kidney, it is termed hernia and mass, with lower abdomen heat and pain, producing white discharge, also called &quot;gu&quot;; when it refers to the foot&#39;s Jueyin channels, if the yin organs fail to function, being injured by cold causes the yin to contract, while injury from heat results in excess expansion and lack of control, both pertain to the heat aspect of hernias. This shows that the &quot;Neijing&quot; does not neglect either cold or heat. Observing Danxi, it states: since the &quot;Suwen,&quot; everything has been considered cold, as cold governs contraction. If the meridians are affected by cold, they draw in and do not flow, leading to pain.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>However, there are those who can kick ice and wade through water but remain free from illness for a lifetime, due to the absence of heat within. Generally, this condition arises from damp-heat in the channels, becoming stagnant over time, and then being constrained by external cold, preventing dispersion, which causes pain. If it were solely caused by cold, it might not lead to a complete condition. This is what Danxi argues. Therefore, treatments often focus on fire, with an increased use of herbs like gardenia and berberine. I cannot refrain from commenting on this. Observing the Inner Canon’s discussion on hernias, it is clear that it is not merely a matter of cold; while there is often more mention of cold than heat, this is also a fundamental principle of hernia treatment that cannot be changed. Moreover, hernias are caused by the invasion of cold evil into the channels, resulting in pain, and only after a long duration can it turn into stagnation and heat. If the condition initially does not suffer from cold, how could a hernia develop? Here, cold is the root cause and heat is the superficial manifestation.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>If one argues that the onset of damp heat stems from internal channels and is compounded by external pathogens causing pain, then it would mean that heat is the root cause while cold is merely a superficial symptom. Is this truly the case? As for those who kick ice or wade in water and remain healthy for a lifetime, despite distinctions of wealth and duration, it is evident that some possess a strong internal yang that cold cannot invade. If one claims that there is no internal heat, thus cold cannot penetrate, is that also accurate? The causes of illness must be discerned. Therefore, when discussing the principles in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which are precise and appropriate, how could they be disregarded? In later generations, common discussions are often overly biased and flawed; how can we uncritically accept them? </p>
<p>Moreover, in treating such conditions, one cannot hastily assume it is solely due to cold or solely due to heat. One must primarily address the initial invading pathogen by warming the channels, dispersing cold, regulating qi, and eliminating dampness. It is imperative not to apply cold or cooling methods too early, as this could leave lingering pathogenic influences, leading to significant harm. Over time, there are cases that begin with cold, others where heat arises from stagnant cold, and some where the original yang is injured, causing increasing weakness. </p>
<p>It is essential to examine the patient’s symptoms and the cause of their illness, and to adapt the treatment accordingly. If indeed there are signs of heat, obvious pulses, or visible symptoms, then it is appropriate to treat with cooling methods. However, if heat signs are not present, yet one insists that hernias are generally due to damp heat, this leads to some individuals developing conditions while others worsen. This is a common fallacy in practice that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>On Treatment</p>
<p>In treating hernias, one must investigate their causes. Although they may result from exposure to cold or dampness, they can also stem from desires, overexertion, anger, or from drinking and eating moist substances without caution, leading to cold evils entering the body. This causes the yin to seek yin, resulting in a blockage in the sea of blood and energy, ultimately descending to the lower yin section, resulting in various hernias. Therefore, regarding symptoms: some manifest after encountering cold; some develop heat after prolonged stagnation; some appear with qi counterflow due to pent-up anger; some arise from dampness causing cold stagnation; some are caused by extreme fatigue leading to injury; some occur when deficiency evils affect the lesser yin and greater yin related to desires; and some result from moisture from food and drink in the yangming and taiyin after consuming wine or rich foods. Over time, the righteous qi becomes trapped and cannot rise, while the evil qi lingers and does not dissipate, leading to chronic conditions that are difficult to heal. Thus, in treating hernias, one must precisely determine their origins and treat accordingly for successful outcomes. If one is confused and blindly adheres to partial views, failing to gain insight even into old age, discussions will ultimately be of no benefit. Therefore, in treating hernias, it is essential first to treat the qi, hence the name &quot;hernia qi&quot; is not without reason.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>There is cold qi accompanying coldness, heat qi with heat, damp Qi with dampness, and contrary qi with opposition. When qi is in the yang aspect, it manifests as the qi within the qi; when in the yin aspect, it manifests as the qi within the blood. For excessive qi, one must disperse it; for deficient qi, one must replenish it. Therefore, in the treatment of hernias, one must use qi-regulating medicines alongside other treatments. If hernia pain is sudden and severe, it is due to qi counteracting, thus one should first use the Li Xiang San; for excessive stagnation of qi, one should use Baojian Chuanlian San or Tiantai Wuyao San. If there is no substantial pathogen but cold prevails, a warming liver decoction should be the primary remedy.</p>
<p>Cold hernias are particularly painful and often caused by exposure to cold pathogens or consumption of cold foods. Symptoms include a preference for warmth, aversion to cold, thin and wiry pulse, cold extremities, and lack of warmth in urine and stool. For mild cold conditions, one should use Li Xiang San, Warming Liver Decoction, Shenqi Wan, Shenying San, or Dingxiang Lian Shi Wan. For severe cold conditions, one should use Yilin Sishen Wan, Shijiu Xuanfang Debu Wan, Hulu Ba Wan, or Chenxiang Gui Fu Wan. One method is to take Wujisan with salt-fried Wu Zhu Yu and Xiao Hui Xiang, each one qian, along with five slices of ginger and five inches of green onion, decocted and taken on an empty stomach in hot form, which greatly mitigates unbearable qi pain.</p>
<p>Heat hernias can also cause significant pain.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>When the pathogenic heat of fire gathers in the yin area causing pain, there must be signs of heat, such as feverish pulse, constipation, or difficulty in urination due to heat blockage, or symptoms of distension and fullness with a preference for cold. It is advisable to use the major clear drink or Yinchen Decoction added with fennel and Fructus Tetracuscus, or modified Tongxin Decoction and sunflower seed soup. </p>
<p>In cases where the kidney is not deficient but the liver channel has excessive damp-heat and fire, causing pain in the stem, tightness of the sinews, pain or itchiness, swelling or protrusion that does not retract, and white discharge like seminal fluid following urination, this is termed &quot;sinew hernia.&quot; The treatment should be the Longdan Qinggan Decoction.</p>
<p>Damp hernias often present as heaviness, fullness, and sometimes pain; thus, treatment should consider both cold and heat symptoms. Those with persistent heaviness without pain are classified as &quot;neither number nor hernia.&quot; The treatment should focus on resolving dampness and regulating qi, using modified Wuling Powder, or Jufang Shouxia Pills, or Cangzhu Powder, or San Ceng Fennel Pills. It is said that for treating &quot;neither number hernia,&quot; abstaining from sexual activities and rich foods is necessary to achieve effectiveness.</p>
<p>Hernias worsen with alcohol due to damp-heat, so dampness must be resolved first. For dampness and heat, use major clear drink with added fennel and Fructus Tetracuscus. If dampness accompanies cold, one should use modified Wuling Powder or apply Ge Hua Jiejing Decoction with adjustments.</p>
<p>Blood accumulation in the lower abdomen is termed blood hernia.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>If one observes that it is neither a matter of qi nor food, the lower abdomen is distended and palpable, and the stool is dark and constipated, while urination is smooth, there must be blood accumulation or forms of blood-related hernias. In such cases, one should use peach kernel paste, or peach kernel decoction, or similar herbal formulas for purging.</p>
<p>When a hernia occurs in conjunction with sexual desire, it is surely a sign of kidney yin deficiency. If there is kidney yin deficiency along with rising fire, one should use the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction with additions like Huangbo, Zhimu, Shanzhizi, Fennel, and Chuanlian. If it is kidney yin deficiency without fire, or if it includes cold with pain in the essence, one should use the Nourishing Yin Decoction or the Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction with Fennel and Goji berries, or take the Warm Liver Decoction.</p>
<p>Chronic hernias are always linked to more deficiency patterns. This may be due to a pre-existing weakness in the original qi, or to a lack of endurance where slight exertion triggers symptoms. One should differentiate based on pulse and symptoms. In treating deficient hernias, one must assess whether the deficiency is in the yin or yang aspect. For yin deficiency, mild cases may be treated with Warm Liver Decoction or Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction; severe cases may require the Nourishing Yin Decoction and perhaps formulas for tonifying yin and benefitting qi. If it is a case of yang deficiency, one should use Warm Stomach Drink, Gui Pi Decoction, or the Benefit Middle and Increase Qi Decoction. If yang deficiency is severe, one must include ingredients like Cinnamon, Aconite, Pepper, and Ginger, or employ the Six-Flavor Return Yang Drink.</p>
<p>If there is a combination of deficiency and stagnation, one should primarily follow the previous treatment principle and add medications for guiding and dispersing, such as Chuanlianzi, Fennel, Zhi Shi, Hawthorn, and Gardenia, using them appropriately as adjuncts.</p>
<p>For hernias with pathogenic excess that need to be purged, refer to the discussions in Zhang Zihe&#39;s writings.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>According to the treatment of hernias by Zihe, although there are various methods, they all primarily involve purging. Therefore, it cannot be devoid of bias. Liu Zonghou and Xu Yongcheng expressed doubts about this method, suggesting it might be excessive, but they did not say it should be completely disregarded. Examining Danxi&#39;s approach, he stated that treating hernias should not involve purging—this is indeed a stark contradiction.</p>
<p>I examined Zihe’s treatment cases, such as the case of Cai Canjun, who suffered from severe hernia pain after sitting on wet ground. He was treated with Water-Guide Pills and recovered. Another patient had a hernia due to excessive drinking caused by a fever; the physician administered ginger and prepared medicinal wine, which caused dryness and heat to constrict his condition, leading to a heavy, swollen scrotum. It was only after treating him with Water-Guide Pills followed by Pigskin Powder that he recovered. There was also a man who suddenly developed a hernia, which was red, swollen, and excruciating, persisting for several days. Various medicines were ineffective, likened to stones thrown into water. Eventually, he was treated with Water-Guide Pills and then Tongjing Powder, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In such cases, can we truly say purging is completely inappropriate? Therefore, it is essential to consider the specifics of deficiency and urgency. If there is obstruction from excessive heat, or if it is a young person suffering from a sudden illness, or if there is extreme swelling and pain, then medications such as Water-Guide Pills, Three-Hua Divine Aid Pills, and Yugong Powder should be used. When the evil is rampant and urgent, and cannot be alleviated by milder remedies that regulate qi or promote diuresis, more aggressive treatment becomes necessary. This method of Zihe is also one that must not be abandoned; it requires careful consideration.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p>
<h3>Yin Sores</h3>
<p>For the treatment of this condition, if there is swelling and pain with internal and external ulceration, it is best to use a decoction of peony and thistle, or a modified Si Wu Decoction with gardenia, moutan root, gentian, and schisandra. Alternatively, a modified Xiao Yao San may be used. If there is dampness and itching, a decoction of peony and thistle or Gui Pi Decoction with encouraging herbs, gardenia, and moutan root is recommended. In the case of painful urination with a thick discharge, Long Dan Decoction for clearing the liver should be taken with white atractylodes and moutan root added. If there is profuse discharge and severe pain and swelling due to excessive heat, Da Fen Qing Yin or Chou Xin Yin should be utilized. For swelling with toxic buildup, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be taken with gardenia and moutan root added. For cases that can be washed, a hundred herb decoction should be used. For those that can be applied externally, Piao Xiao San or Wan Chuang San is recommended.</p>
<h3>Lower Sores</h3>
<p>Lower sores are essentially a condition of liver and kidney damp-heat. If there is no external cause for the illness, it suffices to clear the damp-heat or nourish the true yin. Once the damp-heat is cleared, the sores will heal on their own, and there will be no need for excessive worry. However, if one is affected by toxic forces, depending on the depth of the poison, the severity of the illness varies, and it is advisable to use a hundred herb wash treatment, applying Piao Xiao San externally; lighter cases will resolve themselves. If the damp-heat is severe and causes swelling and pain, a decoction of peony and thistle should be administered to treat both aspects. If the toxicity is intense, Bi Xie Decoction can also be used. If one is affected by evil influences and the poison penetrates directly into the essence palace, recovery is not easy; treatment should follow the aforementioned methods. However, if no visible poison shows itself and a broad sore appears, then only after the lower sores begin to heal will the treatment follow as mentioned under the respective section. Upon observation of sore and poison, treatment should be directed as noted in the relevant context.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br><strong>Bian Du</strong></p>
<p>The discussion on bian du (venereal disease) is thoroughly detailed according to the method of the Xue family. However, it is primarily those who engage in unclean interactions and encounter toxic influences that suffer the most. This often begins with a sore on the lower part of the body, and before it has healed, the bian du follows. This is the harm caused by damp heat and filthy toxins. </p>
<p>In the initial stage of swelling and pain, when pus has not yet formed and the vital energy remains strong, it is crucial to eliminate the poison quickly. The best remedies are either Hui Pung San or Mu Li San. If pus has already formed, it may be addressed by puncturing or cauterizing; the key is to remove the pus swiftly and adjust treatment according to the resulting symptoms for quick healing.</p>
<p>If a lump first appears with mild pain and swelling, there are two indications: one is a light邪 (pathogenic factor), and the other is weak vital energy with deep toxicity. For a light邪, using Hui Tong Gao with musk as a plaster will ensure dispersal; alternatively, Jiang Ying San can also be used. If the vital energy is weak and the toxicity deep, it neither disperses nor ruptures early, and the longer it persists, the worse it becomes, making it particularly feared. After it ruptures, it often cannot heal; the mild case may result in a fistula, and the severe may lead to death. Therefore, substantial replenishment of vital energy is essential to avoid harm.</p>
<p>If there is intense swelling and pain, and pus is about to form and cannot be resolved, it is advisable to use Jiang Ying San while leaving the head intact; this can help contain the situation, relieve pain, and promote the rapid formation and rupture of pus.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>The Strong Yang Does Not Fall</strong>  </p>
<p>The strong yang does not fall; this is due to the excess fire rising up, preventing the lung&#39;s metal energy from descending. If one uses a decoction of huangbo (phelodendron) and zhimu (anemarrhena), it will immediately disperse. However, if it falls afterward, persisting for a whole year and beyond without recovery, it becomes a source of suffering. The formula should include three taels of yuanshen (radix polygalae) and maidong (ophiopogon), along with three fen of rougui (cinnamon), boiled in water for consumption to restore balance. This formula is effective because yuanshen helps to drain the floating fire from the kidneys; especially, the three fen of rougui draws it inward, inviting the excessive fire back into balance, as they seek each other in harmony. Moreover, maidong further assists the lung&#39;s metal energy in descending to generate kidney water; when there is sufficient water, the fire will naturally cease.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br><strong>Weak Yang and Lack of Vitality</strong></p>
<p>When there is weakness and lack of vitality, it stems from excessive refinement, which leads to the daily depletion of the water in the kidneys, while the fire in the kidneys also gradually diminishes. Indeed, when water leaves, fire must also leave; this is a necessary principle. For example, if a household has no water in the kitchen, how can they cook and create smoke? One must first draw water from the source before gathering firewood; only then can fire be ignited to cook food. Otherwise, the pot remains empty and unheated. </p>
<p>One should use one tael of cooked rehmannia, four qian of cornelian cherry, one qian each of polygala root, morinda root, eucommia bark, and cistanche, three qian each of ginseng and goji berries, two qian each of poria and cinnamon, and five qian of white atractylodes, boiled in water. One dose rises, two doses strengthen, and three doses are wonderful. For elderly individuals, the dosage should be increased. This method uses warm herbs to replenish water; thus, fire rises without concern for burning calamities, naturally allowing for broth to be consumed and rice to be cooked, preventing the pot from burning dry or risking explosions.</p>
<p>For Yang that is completely down, use one jin of cooked rehmannia, two jin of astragalus, six liang each of morinda root and Angelica, and three liang each of cinnamon and biota seed (washed of oil), as well as raspberry and ophiopogon, and eight liang of white atractylodes, all ground into powder and formed into pills with honey. Take one tael daily with boiling broth, and naturally, the Yang will thrive and not falter.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>Fox Hernia</p>
<p>In the treatment of men and women, there is fundamentally no difference, yet there are unique aspects. The difference in conditions between men and women lies in hernias, where men may experience strong yang but still suffer from impotence. However, concerning hernias, the only distinction for women is the fox hernia; all others are the same. The fox hernia retracts during the day above the pouch and hangs down at night below the pouch. This condition arises from cold and dampness, along with the improper influences of yin and yang, occurring at the moment of interaction, or along the pathways of spirit or during damp conditions. </p>
<p>For treatment, use five qian of wormwood, pound it to extract the juice, wash it with cold water, take one bowl of the juice, add one liang of sand ginseng, and one qian each of cassia, cinnamon twig, fennel, and tangerine kernel. Boil in water and consume. One dose will allow it to extend, two doses will reduce it, and three doses will achieve complete recovery.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br><strong>Fang (Formula)</strong></p>

<p>Notes:<br>If the condition has not erupted, pus, and blood may discharge with stool. Xue Ji commented: This formula is an astringent and cold remedy for stagnation. If there is prolonged neglect of marital matters, constipation, fever, and burning pain, or strong engagement of vital energy, leading to complicated blood intertwining, swelling, pain, and constipation, it is advisable to use this remedy. Conversely, for individuals who are fatigued without significant swelling, having regular bowel habits, or exhibiting reddish and hot urine without purulence, and those whose wounds do not heal, it is better to use the Ten-Ingredient Great Tonifying Decoction. This condition often arises from insufficient labor or excessive sexual activity, leading to depletion of vital energy. A popular saying is: &quot;One stone of rice sore,&quot; implying it can be cured after a hundred days.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>If one can greatly tonify the qi and blood, recovery can occur in a few days—why then require a hundred days? The healing of wounds depends on the abundance of qi and blood. I once treated a scholar named Ling Daizhi who suffered from deficiency and took harmful medications, nearly resulting in a critical state. I prescribed a remedy to strengthen his spleen, and he recovered. Scholar Wang Wenyuan suffered from labor and ailments, took Xiao Chaihu Decoction, which resolved exterior symptoms, and later used my remedy to drain and treated the abscess, recovering in several days. Judge Hu had clear pus and weak veins; he only used tonifying medicine and was healed. However, after recently marrying, he relapsed and self-administered a detoxifying decoction, leading to uncontrolled diarrhea and ultimately death. This illustrates that such conditions are often due to insufficiency and must be tonified. Generally, pustules belong to the liver meridian; initially, they are firm and hard due to the liver&#39;s dominance over the tendons. After five to seven days, they should become red and soft with pus; if still hard, it indicates deficiency of the original qi, unable to decompose. Often, people see hardness and only want to remove it internally, inadvertently taking aggressive herbs that lead to further deficiency. The previously mentioned cases are examples of this issue. </p>

It has remarkable effects on all such ailments. </p>
<p>The herbs gathered from fields and mountains can be used indiscriminately, although mountain herbs are preferred, particularly those that are aromatic and pungent. In winter, dried herbs may be used, but they must be harvested in advance. </p>
<p>Regardless of quantity, prepare a concentrated decoction by boiling it down, and while hot, use it to steam and wash the affected area, applying it with a cloth. After a considerable time, ensure that the medicinal vapor thoroughly penetrates, and then apply other medicines. This should be done two to three times daily as often as possible. </p>
<p>The cooling properties of certain herbs can dispel heat, while warming ones can disperse cold. Aromatic herbs can promote the flow of qi, and detoxifying ones can eliminate toxins. Every herb has its use and benefit. When the decoction captures the properties of the herbs, its vapor becomes harmless; when the herbs absorb the vapor, their power is enhanced. </p>
<p>The principle of using various herbs to create a decoction follows this reasoning. This method is indeed one of the most essential and effective in surgery, also shared with those outside the medical profession.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a><br><strong>Piao Xiao San</strong> is used to treat damp-heat necrosis, toxic sores with oozing, or sores in the lower part of the kidney capsule, and for swollen and painful sores in the groin, all of which yield miraculous effects. <strong>Hai Piao Xiao</strong> is divided into equal parts with &quot;Ren Zhong Bai&quot; (or &quot;Ren Zhong Huang&quot; or &quot;Nai Sha&quot; is also acceptable). </p>
<p>Make a fine powder of the above, first boil a strong decoction of various herbs, then use it hot to steam and wash the affected area, followed by applying this medication. If it is dry, mix with sesame oil, rendered pig fat, or honey water for application. If swollen and very painful, adding a bit of borneol is even better. For wet sores with much pus, adding equal parts of <strong>Mi Tuo Sang</strong> (or calcined alum powder) is also recommended; mixing with calcined <strong>Lu Gan Shi</strong> (heavy metal) is even more effective.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Zhu Yan</strong> is for treating lice in the hair and other insect-infested sores. Take four or five parts of <strong>Yin Zhu</strong>, rub it on thick paper, light it, and place it in a bowl covered with a damp bowl above it to capture the smoke on the underside. Use a finger to rub the smoke onto the scalp and cover it with a wool hat, then all lice will be eradicated. This smoke can also be made into cakes with jujube pulp, or formed into pills, or rubbed on between cooked pig or chicken livers for application to insect-infested sores and ringworm. For insects affecting the anal area, a jujube pill wrapped in cotton can be inserted into the anus overnight, and it will certainly be effective. Be sure to leave some cotton hanging outside for easy removal.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a><br><strong>Wanchuang San</strong>: Used to treat various moist ulcers that do not close when the flesh is flat and for ulcers where the internal flesh is already flat but has an opening that does not heal.

<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: When there is low back pain, one cannot turn or shake; urgently needling the Yin and egg points, the eight hui points should be needled alongside the pain. The eight hui points are located between the waist and buttocks. When there is disease in the lower abdomen with abdominal pain, preventing bowel movements, the condition is called hernia, caused by cold. Needle between the lower abdomen and thighs, and between the ankle bone and the waist. Needling should be thorough to promote healing; with needling, the illness is resolved. </p>
<p>The Du meridian begins from the center of the bones below the lower abdomen. In women, it connects to the uterus cavity, which is situated at the end of the urinary opening; it transmits to the yin organs, encircles the coccyx, separates and connects to the perineium, and merges with the major yang energy in the body, linking to the lesser yin on the inner side of the thigh and penetrating the spine to associate with the kidneys. For men, it follows the penis down to the perineum, similar to women. When illness arises and rushes from the lower abdomen up to the heart causing pain, preventing forward and backward movement, it is called &quot;chong hernia.&quot; Women may experience infertility, urinary retention, incontinence, and dry throat. Illness in the Du meridian is treated along the Du meridian itself, preferably at the bones, and in severe cases, below the navel. </p>
<p>Evil influences affecting the foot&#39;s jueyin meridian can cause sudden severe pain from hernia. Needle the area where the big toe&#39;s nail and flesh meet, for both men and women. Treat the left for the right, and the right for the left. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says: The pain in the muscles of the foot&#39;s taiyin meridian is associated with the pain of the yin organs, pulling down to the sides of the abdomen, treated with fire needles and points, using the pain as a guide for method. </p>
<p>The small intestine controls the testicles, pulling the spine upward to the heart, where evil resides in the small intestine, connecting to the testicular cords, relating to the spine, penetrating the liver and lung, and linking to the heart cord.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br>When the qi is abundant, it causes counterflow and upward surging, affecting the liver through the intestines and stomach. It disperses to the diaphragm and is tied at the navel, thus one should take from the diaphragm to disperse. Use the taiyin point to give relief, taking from below the jueyin, and also from the juxu and xialian points to eliminate it. Press along the pathways it travels to regulate it. </p>
<p>The foot jueyin diverges, termed ligou, located five inches from the inner ankle, it separately travels to the shaoyang. Its pathway ascends through the shins and concludes at the testes. When the qi is reversed, it causes swelling and sudden hernias; if excess, it protrudes, and if deficient, it is violently itching, hence the treatment is at its divergence.</p>
<p>For issues in the small intestine, there is pain in the lower abdomen, with aching in the waist and spine radiating to the testes. At times this aggravates and brings heat to the front of the ear. If there is intense cold, the heat might be only on one shoulder, and if severe, heat can be felt between the little finger and next finger. If the pulse is sunken, this is the sign.</p>
<p>Hand taiyang issues should be treated by using the juxu and xialian points. The &quot;Yao Yi Jing&quot; states: For pain in the waist and legs that is clear, it is good to press the testes and jump, with the shangjiao as the main point. </p>

<p>For pain in the lower abdomen and difficulty urinating, along the lateral bones is where treatment should focus. </p>

<li>For obstructed urination and related symptoms, manage with Rangu.</li>
</ul>
<p>This interpretation organizes the symptoms and the recommended treatments based on the ancient medical understanding presented in the text.<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a><br>When suffering from hernia, with pain in the lower abdomen, the point &quot;Zhaohai&quot; is to be treated. For pain on the left, treat the right; for pain on the right, treat the left; the treatment is immediate. For hernia, when the limbs feel heavy and the body is oppressed, &quot;Zhiyin&quot; is the main point to address.</p>
<p>The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; states: loss of essence leads to muscle spasms and the penis drawing into the abdomen, causing referred pain. Cauterize 50 times at the middle of the tendon in front of the inner ankle. It further mentions: cauterize 50 times below the malleolus for adults; for children, follow the age-adjusted method. The point at the perineum is for coldness in the head of the penis.</p>
<p>The point &quot;Xingjian&quot; is for pain in the shaft, and &quot;Yingu&quot; is for impotence and urgent pulling pain in the lower abdomen. For hernia (ta), cauterize 10 times beneath the big toe, and along the edges where swelling occurs. The &quot;Zhou Hou Fang&quot; states: cauterize 5 times at the center below the second joint of the foot’s second toe. According to the Yao family, the third joint of the toe should have 3 cauterizations.</p>
<p>For painful swelling at the genitals, cauterize 3 times at &quot;Datun.&quot; &quot;Ququan&quot; manages the hernia with pain that radiates to the belly button, presenting with an inability to urinate and impotence. Another source indicates pain radiating from the penis with inability to urinate. &quot;Zhongdu&quot; addresses pecuniary hernia and severe cases with no awareness of surroundings.</p>
<p>&quot;Zhongwan&quot; deals with &quot;chong&quot; hernia, which can be fatal with no awareness of the person.<a id="trans-293p" href="#orig-293p" class="marker">[293p]</a><br>In He yang and Zhong qi, the primary focus is on the pain caused by hernia and internal bleeding, accompanied by abdominal pain, intestinal disorders, and severe pelvic pain. </p>

<p>Tai chong, Zhong feng, and Di ji address hernias with insufficient essence, with Tai chong also associated with fox hernias and symptoms of nausea and fainting. </p>
<p>Yin jiao and Shi men focus on issues concerning the testes. Shi men also addresses abdominal distension due to hernias. </p>
<p>Tai chong handles retraction of the testes and cases where the abdomen is firm and uncomfortable for lying down.<a id="trans-294p" href="#orig-294p" class="marker">[294p]</a><br>The &quot;Jisheng Fang&quot; states: For the illness of large slippage, the key point is located three inches below the umbilicus. Moxibustion with one hundred cups is effective. For the seven types of hernia, take half a pound of salt, fry it until extremely hot, and use a cloth bag to apply it to the painful area. The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; says that for hernia, place moxa sticks on either side of the hernia or in a vertical cross pattern, and perform moxibustion seven times. The &quot;Dongyuan Shishu&quot; mentions that for sudden hernia pain, you should puncture the foot&#39;s Jueyin point. The &quot;Qixiao Liangfang&quot; describes Zhang Zhongwen&#39;s miraculous moxibustion method for heavy pain in the lower back and knees, where turning or sitting is difficult, and for cold cramps in the legs that make bending and stretching impossible. Moxibustion is applied at the knee on both sides and at the four locations of the feet, three times each. Each moxibustion on a foot involves two flames being applied until the moxa ignites on the flesh. Initially, there is pain; having two people blowing on both sides helps until the fire is extinguished. This should be done at noon. Once the person is settled, the organs may spontaneously shift or move with a rumbling sound, leading to immediate recovery. This method is remarkably effective and cannot be overestimated. The &quot;Yixue Gangmu&quot; states that in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; there are four methods for treating lower abdominal pain with acupuncture and moxibustion, the first concerning the liver meridian.<a id="trans-295p" href="#orig-295p" class="marker">[295p]</a><br>It is said that liver disease manifests as pain under the ribs extending to the lower abdomen, affecting the channels of the Jueyin and Shaoyang. Furthermore, it is stated that when the pathogen invades the collaterals of the Jueyin, it causes sudden and severe pain similar to hernia, which can be treated by needling the area where the big toe nail meets the flesh on either side, with men needing to stand and women needing a moment of rest; one should treat the left side for the right side and the right side for the left.</p>
<p>Secondly, concerning the small intestine channel. It is said that small intestine disease brings about pain in the small intestine, along with pain in the lumbar region affecting the testes, often occurring after discomfort. For treatment, one should needle the points of Ju Void (Juxu) and below the lateral border. It is further noted that pain in the small intestine can extend to the lumbar region, affecting the heart, indicating that the pathogen resides in the small intestine; to dispel it, needle Huāngyuán to scatter and Taīyīn to provide relief, targeting points below Jueyin and utilizing Ju Void to remove it, and apply pressure along its pathways to balance the energy. Additionally, for sudden severe pain, needle the points of the foot Taiyin and Jueyin to drain the blood collaterals.</p>
<p>Thirdly, addressing the bladder channel.<a id="trans-296p" href="#orig-296p" class="marker">[296p]</a><br>For those suffering from bladder disease, the lower abdomen is swollen and painful on one side; pressing it with the hand causes the urge to urinate but fails to produce urine. Treatment is applied at the central point. Additionally, if there is pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, with inability to urinate, it indicates an evil in the Sanjiao; treatment relies on the foot Taiyang channel. </p>
<p>Next is the discussion on the governing, conception, and chong channels. It is said that if the Governor Meridian becomes ill, pain arises from the lower abdomen and radiates upward towards the heart, preventing forward and backward movement, known as chong hernia. If the Conception Meridian is affected, men may suffer from hernias, while women may experience leucorrhea and abdominal masses. </p>
<p>When the Yuan organs become activated, if there is unbearable pain below the navel, treatment should be done at Qihai and Sanyinjiao for immediate relief. Treat the left side while taking from the right, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For hernia with pain on one side of the lower abdomen, acupuncture is applied at Dading (Da Dun) two fen, three fen towards the back along the skin, with drainage and moxibustion; treat from the left while taking from the right, and vice versa. At Sanyinjiao, one cun is drained for ten inhales.</p>
<p>Another method involves using points: Dading, Shuidao, and Xiaohai.</p>
<p>Additionally, moxibustion is applied at Zhongji and Yinshi (Yin Kidney).</p>
<p>In cases of sudden unbearable pain from hernia in the lower abdomen, use Dading three fen, drain for six breaths, and perform moxibustion seven times; at Yinshi, three fen and moxibustion five times; at Zhaohai, three fen and moxibustion seven times. All these treatments are performed from the left while taking from the right, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For abdominal masses and hernia involving the small intestine, bladder, and kidney, acupuncture is performed at Qihai and Wushu, with burning needles inserted five fen and complementary moxibustion performed one hundred times. Additionally, treat at Sanli and Sanyinjiao.</p>
<p>For hernias: treat at Sanyinjiao, Zusanli, and Sanjian.<a id="trans-297p" href="#orig-297p" class="marker">[297p]</a><br>Sure! Here is the translated text:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Hernia</strong>: Acupuncture points are located at the intercostal area and Sanli.</p>
<p><strong>General Method</strong>: For hernia, points used include Guanmeng, Guanyuan, Shui Dao, and Sanyinjiao; if symptoms persist, additionally use Haidi and Guilai. </p>
<p><strong>Lower Abdominal Pain</strong>: Acupuncture points are Guanyuan and Sanli.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Inner Canon</em>, there are four methods for acupuncture and moxibustion treatment of hernia. The first method is what this article refers to as &#39;using a jade stone to extract liquid from the scrotum.&#39; This is a method that many in the present day can also perform. When the scrotum is as large as a doudou, it contains impure liquid, which can be several liters, thus confirming this method is from ancient practices.</p>
<p>The second method involves treating the liver. The text states: &#39;The channel of the foot Jueyin affects hernia in men and abdominal swelling in women.&#39; Therefore, for the foot Jueyin liver channel, assess the condition of excess or deficiency as well as heat or cold; administer treatments accordingly with tonification or dispersal, and leave moxibustion for illness.</p>
<p>The third method targets the collateral of the liver. The text states: &#39;The branch of the foot Jueyin is called Ligou, located five inches above the inner ankle, diverging to the Shaoyang.&#39; The path of this branch runs along the shin and converges near the genital area; when symptoms are characterized by counterflow of pathogenic Qi, the scrotum may swell and hernia becomes apparent. Therefore, five inches above the inner ankle, apply on the area close to the bone at the back of the shin—this is where Ligou is used.</p>
<p>The fourth method uses the muscle of the foot Yangming. The text states: &#39;The muscle of the foot Yangming gathers in the upper abdomen near the genitals; symptoms include cramping, swelling in the thigh, and intense abdominal pain.&#39; Treatment involves using fire needles to prick at the painful areas, determining the number based on pain response. Apply fire needle at the site of cramping pain.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Offsetting Descent</strong>: Needle through the skin along the kidney seam to alleviate symptoms.&quot;<a id="trans-298p" href="#orig-298p" class="marker">[298p]</a><br>The wooden kidney is red and swollen as large as a balloon, but it does not hurt: Take Dadu, Sanyinjiao, Haidi, and return to the waterway two inches below, insert the needle two and a half inches deep, and moxibust seven times. </p>
<p>For the red and swollen wooden kidney with dampness weighing down: Take the gate of the kidney, two inches beside the hairline at the root of the jade stem, insert the needle two and a half inches deep; also take Sanyinjiao.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Mirror&quot; states: To treat any downward-pressing gas pain, use one raw castor seed per year, remove the skin, grind it into paste, and apply it to the top of the head. The patient should lie on their back with their feet soles facing each other, binding the middle fingers at the joint, and moxibust a moxa-sized portion seven times, then it will ascend immediately.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Principles&quot; states: The ancient texts suggest, for men with pain in the head of the penis and women with pain in the vagina, one should moxibust the Dadu abnormal point. For dampness and itching in the vagina, and sores on the outer kidney, moxibust at Haidi.</p>
<p>For men with a cold scrotum and women with coldness in the vagina, moxibust at the Return point.</p>
<p>The &quot;Orthodox Surgery&quot; states: The fire needle method treats symptoms like fish mouth, poisonous urination, and transverse lumps, used when medicinal herbs cannot be consumed internally.<a id="trans-299p" href="#orig-299p" class="marker">[299p]</a><br>Using a coarse needle, split one end of a bamboo chopstick, separate it about half the distance with the needle, and place it inside the end of the chopstick, tying it tightly with thread. Store this in a tung oil lamp. Light five threads of lampwick dipped in oil. Dip the needle in oil until it turns red, then puncture the affected area deeply (about five to six tenths of an inch). Blood or pus may come out, and applying an ointment will yield convenience with gradual healing thereafter. For weakness, also take the &quot;Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p>For moxibustion treatment: Wait for clear weather, avoiding the days of the spirit. The patient should lie flat on their back. Take the root of the wood kidney plant and mark the hard stem at the bottom with ink. Use a moxa ball the size of a small bean, and perform moxibustion seven times if within three years, nine times if after a year, stopping at eleven treatments. Internally take the Wood Fragrance Kidney Tonifying Pills. Avoid eating raw and cold food and refrain from sexual activity for a hundred days for best results.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states: &quot;To treat a hernia, use a handful of mud green onions, place them in the navel, and apply a hot iron on top, or apply moxa above it; both methods are effective.&quot; </p>
<p>Another method: Take a bundle of green onions, remove the whiskers and leaves, and cut them into one-inch thick pieces. Heat the onion pancakes and place them on the navel, using a hot iron to press down; it is especially convenient and effective.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a><br><strong>Guidance for Hernia Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: For treating hernia, sit comfortably with your legs extended. Use both hands to grasp the thumbs, pulling the feet toward the head to support the lower body. Hold the breath for five counts, drawing energy from the abdomen to circulate through the body, alleviating hernia and related ailments, benefiting the orifices, making movement easy. Practice this regularly to gain clarity and lengthen insight.</p>
<p>One method involves rubbing the hands together 100 to 200 times until they become warm, then gently pressing the scrotum until the discomfort dissipates.</p>
<p>The &quot;Examination of Medical Formulas&quot; mentions that an external injury to the kidneys may lead to swelling in the testicles and occasional pain, which can be due to stagnant blood, termed “blood hernia.” It is advisable to support the area with one hand beneath and press with the other, increasing pressure gradually. Repeat this several times. Over a month, stagnant blood will disperse, and old qi will circulate; it is indeed a marvelous technique. Even chronic conditions can be cured over time.</p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; explains that for small intestine hernia, apply pressure on the lower abdomen while taking several breaths, tightly closing the area to see immediate effects.</p>
<p>In terms of energy manipulation, if there is an accumulation of heat in the body and the external kidneys are affected by cold, it can cause swelling and pain, which is hard to describe. Focus on drawing energy from the external kidneys to the internal kidneys, performing this for a total of fourteen cycles. Then visualize a flame within the internal kidneys and guide it upwards to the crown, briefly concentrating before practicing blowing and inhaling techniques.</p>
<p>For external treatment, apply capsicum sachets to disperse the cold; after warming the area, proceed with elevating techniques.<a id="trans-301p" href="#orig-301p" class="marker">[301p]</a><br><strong>Perineum</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Record</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states: Duke Cheng of Anling in Banli was stricken with an illness. I examined the pulse and concluded it was a type of hernia. This hernia is located beneath the diaphragm and connects to the lungs, resulting from an internal condition. My advice is to avoid strenuous activities. Engaging in such activities would surely lead to vomiting blood and death. Upon further examination, I indicated that the patient was unlikely to survive until morning; they were destined to die. This condition arises internally. Hence, I recognized that the patient would show signs of a pulse related to Fan Yang, which indicates a void within them. The prognosis is fatal. The cycle of life and death is intertwined with this hernia. I also noted that other diagnoses could determine survival and that numerous illnesses have been treated over time, making it difficult for me to recall or provide a complete diagnosis. I do not dare to respond with certainty.<a id="trans-302p" href="#orig-302p" class="marker">[302p]</a><br>The wife of the Minister of State from Qi&#39;s Northern Palace fell ill. All the doctors believed it to be an invasion of wind causing an illness in the middle, affecting the lungs, and they treated her by needling the Lesser Yang meridian in her feet. I, however, diagnosed her pulse and concluded: the pathological condition was a dampness obstructing the bladder, causing difficulty both in urination and defecation, with urine appearing red. When exposed to cold, it led to involuntary urination, resulting in abdominal swelling. Due to the illness, when she felt the need to urinate, she could not. This blockage was due to the disease. Hence, I discerned that those who were ill had strong and solid pulses, but their arrival was difficult, indicating the movement of the Jueyin. A difficult pulse indicates dampness obstructing the bladder. The abdominal swelling signals a blockage in the small abdomen caused by the Jueyin. When the Jueyin is excessive, the pulse becomes knotty; when it moves, it causes abdominal swelling. I suggest moxibusting the Jueyin meridians in her feet, one on each side, which will prevent involuntary urination and promote clear urination, alleviating her abdominal pain. Additionally, I shall prepare a medicinal decoction for her. After three days, the dampness will dissipate, and she will recover.<a id="trans-303p" href="#orig-303p" class="marker">[303p]</a><br>The &quot;Records of Travels and Official Matters&quot; states: When Xin Jiaxuan first returned from the north to serve in Jiangnan, he suddenly suffered from a severe illness related to the testicles, which swelled large like a cup. A certain person taught him to procure leaf pearls (which refer to Coix seeds), fry them with the yellow earth of the east, then boil them down with water until soft, and grind them into a paste in a sand pot. Each time, he would mix this paste with two qian of non-ash liquor and consume it, thus achieving a cure. In his later years, Mr. Sha Sui also contracted this illness, and Xin taught him this remedy, which also cured him. However, people in the city cannot find leaf pearls, so they can simply buy Coix seeds from herbal shops, which are also effective. According to the &quot;Materia Medica,&quot; the highest quality Coix seed is considered superior medicine for nourishing life, and consuming it in large quantities is not harmful. For those who wish to lighten their bodies and prolong life, it has a sweet, slightly cold, and non-toxic flavor. It is primarily used to alleviate contractions that hinder movement, remove wind and dampness, ease breathlessness, eliminate cold and evil qi from the muscles and bones, benefit the digestive system, reduce edema, and improve appetite; prolonged use can lighten the body and enhance energy. Its roots are known to host three parasites. They can be harvested in Zhen ding, Pingze, and fields in August, while the roots can be gathered at any time. They are abundant and truly effective medicine. In Shu, there are many Coix seeds among the Ba Peng. Scholars and gentlemen gift them to each other, mixing them into their food. In the city of Rao, there is a lineage student suffering from kidney deficiency and lower back pain. Mr. Sha Sui applied the prescription passed down from his esteemed person, soaking Eucommia bark in wine, roasting it dry, and grinding it into powder. He mixed it with non-ash liquor for consumption. Zhao Ru formulated it accordingly, and after three doses, the patient was healed.<a id="trans-304p" href="#orig-304p" class="marker">[304p]</a><br>The &quot;Ritual of Filial Piety&quot; states: Wang Min suffered from a cold hernia, with a lump below the navel resembling a cucumber, causing sharp pains around the waist that were unbearable. A person administered pills made from boat carriages and a mixture of pig kidneys, about four or five doses. The medicine swirled around the illness three to five times before it passed, and all the discharge was watery. Both pig kidneys and bitter herbal medicine are cold and bitter; it is said that cold treats cold, and this method is extremely effective. However, after the purging, one should avoid drinking cold water and consuming cold foods, and it is advisable to eat dry food, as a cold hernia is fundamentally related to water. On the same day, the illness reduced by eighty percent, and the patient was able to eat double. After several days, taking over a hundred pills made from boat carriage and about four or five taels of the medicine for regulating the channels further aided the process. After three to four days, he took seventy to eighty pills and three taels of pig kidney powder, and soon he was walking healthily as usual.<a id="trans-305p" href="#orig-305p" class="marker">[305p]</a><br>A monk suffered from a hernia, manifesting cold energy that rose to the teeth and descended to the kidneys, tight like a rope; at times, both testicles swelled and felt cold. A physician examined his pulse, finding it fine and weak, and diagnosed it as an autumn pulse. This was due to the metal element being above, which attacked the liver wood below; wood fears metal, thus it cannot extend, resulting in such illness. The liver energy was restrained and unable to nourish the testicles, hence their coldness—truly, it was not from coldness. Metal restrains wood, which transmits to the stomach earth; the stomach belongs to the yangming, hence the upward manifestation to the teeth; the illness was not a dental issue. The liver wood is the mother of heart fire. When the mother cannot extend, the offspring (testicles) also retract, causing them to be cold while fluids accumulate around them. The classic states: when wood is obstructed, it can be opened; when earth is obstructed, it can be drained. After allowing for four releases, he indeed felt the energy harmonize, and the testicles became itchy and warm. The physician remarked: the energy has now entered the testicles. By using fennel and curcuma for medication, with consistent use, he was cured in a month.</p>
<p>Scholar Huo&#39;s son, aged twelve, had swelling and drooping on one side of his testicles. The physician observed that this was due to fright. When fright manifests as an illness, it moves upwards causing vomiting of blood, or downwards causing kidney damage, resulting in water retention. By using amber to promote circulation, it was resolved with one discharge.<a id="trans-306p" href="#orig-306p" class="marker">[306p]</a><br>Li Shenyin, the county official of Runan, suffered from a swelling and excruciating pain in his testicles due to labor for the king, after drinking water while sitting on the wet ground. The dampness descended and flowed into the area, causing the pain. He tried various medicines, including gold bells and Sichuan toon fruit, but they had no effect. He sought treatment from Dai, who said he could take &quot;Xieshui Pill.&quot; Shenyin was confused by this. </p>
<p>After several days, the pain became unbearable, so he decided to consult Dai again. Dai first administered boat-car pills and Jun Chuan powder, leading to the expulsion of greenish froth in great quantity, which relieved the pain. Then he took fennel pills and Wuling powder to regulate the condition, and within three days, the swelling subsided, never to return in his later years. The hernia is related to the liver meridian. The green froth expelled corresponds to the color of the liver.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: a wealthy man once noticed a foul smell from his groin area and, after days of drinking alcohol, felt discomfort in his abdomen and sought my treatment. I replied: the groin area corresponds to the foot jueyin&#39;s meridian that connects to the genitals, exiting through the urethra. All foul smells relate to the heart&#39;s control, dispersing into the five directions as five odors. Entering the liver, it manifests as a foul odor, which is one aspect. </p>
<p>Therefore, one should drain the liver meridian at its branches to address the root cause; after that, drain the lesser chong in the heart meridian to address the symptoms. If there is a malignancy, medicinal treatment should be employed to eliminate it. Alcohol is both warming and flavorful, capable of producing internal dampness and heat. This creates a condition where wind and dampness coalesce in the lower jiao as a pathology. Thus, it is said: &quot;the lower jiao acts like a drainage.&quot; It is also said: &quot;draw out what is below.&quot; Alcohol is a damp and heated liquid, so it should be expelled from the groin area.<a id="trans-307p" href="#orig-307p" class="marker">[307p]</a><br>&quot;The Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng&quot; states: Brother Bao, over twenty years old, has a long, swollen, and weakened jade stem. The skin is sunken and usually moist, making it difficult for him to walk. There is upward qi in the sides, and his hands and feet feel weak. Initially, he was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Huang Lian, with a large dosage to expel damp-heat, and slightly adding Huang Bo to descend the qi that reversed upwards. His swelling gradually subsided, reducing to half, but a hard lump remained in the stem. Therefore, the main remedy became Qing Pi, assisted by a wind-dispersing formula, taken in powdered form. Externally, the juice of loofah mixed with powdered five-colored gall was applied, and he recovered.</p>
<p>The son of the Wang family from Pingjiang, thirty years old, suddenly experienced a long, swollen, and painful essence. His pulse was rapid and strong. Using (Shi Bu) Nitre and Jing Jie Decoction for soaking and washing, and also employing San Yi Cheng Qi Decoction for a strong purge, he recovered.</p>
<p>A neighboring man, over thirty years of age, with a cunning and impatient nature, had long suffered from a chancre that would appear and subside. At the beginning of summer, he suffered from continuous diarrhea and a slight heaviness above the diaphragm. The doctor provided him with Zhongtang, which made him feel as if in a daze, but he soon recovered. When I took his pulse, both hands were weak, and the pulse felt slightly wiry and rapid. I said: This is a deep case of chancre; use Dang Gui Long Hui Pill minus the musk for four doses to help with the diarrhea. I also prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus Ban Xia, adding Huang Lian, Shao Yao, Chuan Xiong, and Sheng Jiang, decocting for five or six doses to stabilize him.</p>
<p>I once treated a person suffering from post-drinking water who had severe pain in the left testicle. I moxibusted the Da Dun point. Happily, I had a waist ointment on hand, which contained Wu, Fu, Ding Xiang, and She Xiang. I used it to massage over the horizontal bone at the top of his pouch, covering it with warm cloth; the pain immediately ceased. After one night, the swelling also disappeared.&quot;<a id="trans-308p" href="#orig-308p" class="marker">[308p]</a><br>I once had a stockpile of tangerines, but later, while traveling in the mountains and suffering from great hunger, I encountered tangerines and edible roots, eating them. The tangerines disturbed my old stockpile, and the roots caused stagnation in my qi. Immediately, my right abdomen became swollen and I experienced both cold and heat. I first took one or two doses of a stomach-regulating potion, then in the morning focused my spirit and qi. Eventually, I felt the accumulation moving and vomited. After vomiting, my stomach qi settled, and my meridians opened, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Zhu, a fellow practitioner from Chi&#39;an, was forty years old. After the rain on the full moon in August, he experienced severe abdominal pain at midnight, sweating profusely. He stomped his feet against a wall in agony, with pain concentrated in the lower abdomen, making it intolerable to touch. His pulse was tense, thin, and firm, and upon palpation, it felt like pressing against a knife&#39;s edge. When questioned, he stated that he had bathed in deep pools during the extreme heat of June, which might have caused his illness. I prescribed the Da Cheng Qi Decoction, resulting in slight diarrhea and the pain subsided.</p>
<p>However, the pain returned the next evening at the time of You, again concentrated in the lower abdomen and hard to the touch. I prescribed another dose of Da Cheng Qi Decoction with added cinnamon, ground peach kernels mixed in and decocted together. This time, the bowel movement yielded dark purple blood, and the pain ceased immediately. The next evening at You, the pain returned as before; although his pulse was slightly weaker, it still had a firm quality. I gave him the Da Cheng Qi Decoction with added aconite in two doses and combined the ground peach kernels for decoction. After a bowel movement, he expelled about two sheng of dark purple blood that resembled broken cotton, and the pain ceased, allowing him to sleep through the night. </p>
<p>On the following day at You, the pain returned as initially experienced. Upon inquiry, his lower abdomen felt relaxed and soft, the pain radiated around the navel area, and his pulse was harmonious, suggesting he might be free of illness, yet he still sighed as before. After learning that he had eaten some radish vegetable soup over two meals, I prescribed Xiao Jian Zhong Tang for one dose, and he recovered.<a id="trans-309p" href="#orig-309p" class="marker">[309p]</a><br>Zheng Zigeng, after drinking wine, consumed water and fruit, leading to illness with swelling in the kidney, producing a croaking sound at times and causing pain.

<p>Chang Shiguan suffered from a descent of bladder qi, experiencing a noise similar to a croaking frog. I used ten fried seeds of smelly oranges, twenty peach seeds, and natural juice from radishes, ground them, and took with seventy Baohuan pills, which led to recovery.<a id="trans-310p" href="#orig-310p" class="marker">[310p]</a><br>Brother Shi is thirty years old, suffering from pain and swelling in the left kidney.

<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In the Gui Chou year, I received a decree to go to Liupan Mountain. I was commanded to treat a long-term hernia known as &quot;fire child&quot; and &quot;red knot.&quot; Additionally, during July, due to hunger and labor, combined with excessive consumption of warm milk, the symptoms worsened significantly, with the patient&#39;s complexion turning pale and yellow, experiencing cramps in the abdomen, excruciating pain, an inability to stretch the waist, and slight relief when applying hot substances. The pulse was thin and rapid. I recalled that the &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that this condition, designated as a man&#39;s illness, is caused by phlegm accumulating in the small intestine due to cold. Only powerful heat remedies can cure it. I then formulated a prescription named “Agarwood and Cinnamon Pill,” and the patient recovered after taking it.</p>
<p>Madam Zhao, the wife of the envoy, aged fifty-eight, in March of the Jiaxu year, experienced cold pain in the navel area, radiating to her sides with unbearable pain, restlessness, and an inability to lie down peacefully. I prescribed Dangkui Si Ni Decoction for her, and after first moxibusting the Zhongting point, she was cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Principles&quot; mentions: Yang Chun&#39;s elder brother had a prior condition affecting kidney qi, causing pain extending to the left side and chest, with much phlegm and occasional obstruction in the diaphragm. The large intestine was constipated, and he typically sweated little. His pulse was tense. I administered twenty pills each of Baohe and Wenzhong, ground peach kernels and (Mu Yu) plum kernels, and he recovered after swallowing them.<a id="trans-311p" href="#orig-311p" class="marker">[311p]</a><br>Ji Tiling had taken cooling medicine for several days due to illness, which led to worsening pain in the lower abdomen, nearly resulting in death.

<p>The 37th Grand Commander suddenly suffered from small intestine gas pains, and the doctors in the capital prescribed medications that proved ineffective. Each episode brought him close to death. The Emperor summoned Du to present medication; however, it did not show results after several doses. The Grand Commander expressed that his time was short, and he was unable to be cured even by a skilled doctor. The Emperor called Du to inquire why. Du replied: &quot;I have used the ancient formulas, but there was no improvement. Today, I have composed a new prescription that I have not yet dared to present. I will first prepare the medicine and administer it to the Grand Commander.&quot; </p>
<p>The first dose showed an 80-90% improvement, and after a second dose, he fully recovered. Du then presented the formula named &quot;Rescue Life Through Heart Powder.&quot; It includes one tael of Chuanwu (Asian wild ginger), one qian of blue salt, soaked overnight in a cup of wine, then peeled, the tip removed, and dried; one tael of Chuanlianzi (sichuan chinaberry), stir-fried with twenty-one grains of Ba Dou (crown flower seeds) until blackened; half a tael of fennel; a pair of stone swallows; five pieces of earth dog; and 1.6 qian of mustard seeds.

The physician prescribed strong medicine, but the pain only worsened, and he had been unable to urinate for three days, feeling distended and troubled below the navel.

What can we do about this?&quot; Song still held several pellets of Si Shen Dan, saying that the doctor advised him to continue taking this. I warned, &quot;If you take this, you will certainly die, and there will be no chance for regret.&quot; He sought treatment. I happened to have about an ounce of Wu Ling San, and I instructed him to prepare it in three doses with one stalk of green onion, a pinch of fennel, a bit of salt, and one and a half cups of water, simmering until reduced to seven tenths, instructing him to take it continuously. In the middle of the night, he urinated a couple of liters of dark-colored urine, and the area below his navel felt relaxed enough for him to sleep. The next day, upon examination, his pulse was stable and calm.

<p>The &quot;Essentials of Medical Practice&quot; states: In Changzhou, Yin Wenhui loved to drink fire liquor and could consume five jin. In May, he went into Fujian and waded through a swiftly rising creek for seven li, experiencing severe abdominal pain. Half a month later, his right testicle became enlarged, gradually resembling the shape of a bucket. The local physicians in Fujian treated him with liver channel remedies and warming herbs, but after half a year without success, he returned to consult me. I said: his love for fire liquor has filled his body with damp heat, while wading in the cold water has left him cold and damp on the outside. Now, as his illness is on the right side, it points to dampness in the spleen and lungs affecting the testicles. I used Wei Ling Tang with added Zhi Zi, Zhi Qiao, Huang Bo, and ten doses of fennel, slightly reducing the dosage. I then formed it into pills, and he took them up to eighteen jin, after which he was completely well. It has been fifteen years since, and he has not relapsed.<a id="trans-314p" href="#orig-314p" class="marker">[314p]</a><br>Literary figure Luo Yuanbin suffered from a hernia for ten years, looking emaciated.

I said: This is what the classic refers to as a &quot;cold hernia.&quot; I prescribed the &quot;Danggui Sini Decoction,&quot; and within half a month, the mass shrank significantly. He then took the &quot;Bawei Pill&quot; intermittently. Delighted that he trusted my advice, after six months of this treatment, the lump disappeared and he never had similar troubles again.</p>

Not believing this, he continued with the paste. After over two months, his bowel movements became loose, he had little appetite, and he also experienced impotence, which made him finally trust my recommendations. Initially, I prescribed &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Tang&quot; with the additional herbs Fu Ling and Ban Xia to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach. His appetite gradually improved, and his bowel movements became more solid. I later removed the two extra herbs, and after over a month he recovered. He continued to take the &quot;Liuwei Dihuang Pill&quot; for more than three months, and his condition returned to normal. Furthermore, the &quot;Qiongyu Paste,&quot; &quot;Guben Pill,&quot; and &quot;Kanli Pill&quot; are all remedies for cold and fire reduction; if the intestines and stomach are not dry and hot, they are not suitable. If taken for an extended period by someone with yin deficiency causing heat, it could lead to infertility, as it depletes yang qi and thus yin blood cannot be generated.

<p>It is common to find patients unwilling to undergo needling, waiting for the sore to rupture on its own, but they do not realize that in crucial areas, if there is pus, it is necessary to needle urgently to allow the poison to escape and prevent internal rupture. Therefore, the ancients said: &quot;For sores, if they are not needled or cauterized, toxins cannot be resolved, and pus and blood cannot be released.&quot; They also mentioned the need to open up to expel the toxins. Patients mistakenly believe that critical areas should not be needled, which is a significant misunderstanding.<a id="trans-318p" href="#orig-318p" class="marker">[318p]</a><br>A man suffered from a hanging abscess; the pus was mature but did not rupture, and his pulse was rapid and weak, indicating a deficiency in both qi and blood. He wished to treat it with tonifying yin and nourishing qi and blood herbs, and also apply acupuncture to help drain the toxic pus outward. However, he was doubtful and did not follow this method, instead using fire-reducing and toxin-expelling medicines, which led to a further weakening of his vital energy and an exacerbation of the sore. Eventually, it ruptured without healing, leading to a condition from which he could not be saved. </p>
<p>The symptoms of a hanging abscess originally stem from a deficiency of yin in the liver and kidney meridians. Though treatment might be possible with nourishment, there is still great risk of failure, especially as the pus develops and is further attacked; how could he survive? Typically, when it starts with swelling and pain or with red, painful urination, one should first use a couple of doses of prepared licorice and moxibustion on garlic, followed by taking Longdan Xiegan Tang (Gentian Decoction to Drain the Liver). </p>
<p>If there is fever and swelling pain, one should use Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with additions of Plantago, Huangbo, Chuanxiong, and Danggui. When pus has formed, it should be pierced. If it has already ruptured, use Ba Zhen Tang (Eight Treasure Decoction) with additions of prepared licorice, Chaihu shoots, wine-fried Huangbo, and Zhimu. </p>
<p>If urination is scanty but the pulse is strong, continue with Longdan Xiegan Tang and add prepared licorice. If urination is scanty and the pulse is weak, use Qingxin Lianzi Yin (Heart-Clearing Lotus Seed Decoction) with prepared licorice. If the pus is clear and does not congeal, use a great tonifying formula and intermittently apply moxibustion with fermented soybeans. If it fails to congeal for a long time, use moxibustion with Fuzi cakes, and it will be effective.<a id="trans-319p" href="#orig-319p" class="marker">[319p]</a><br>The noble Bao Xi, known for his warmth and vitality, took herbal remedies such as the Four Substance Formula, Huang Lian, and Zhimu. After more than a year of suffering from a lingering abscess, he experienced thirst due to phlegm and heat rising to his knees. He increased the doses of Huang Lian and Er Chen, but his phlegm became worse. He asked me, &quot;What is the reason for this?&quot; I replied, &quot;This indicates a deficiency in the three Yin of your body, leading to excess water transforming into phlegm. Cold and cooling medicines harm the stomach, worsening the situation.&quot; Therefore, I prescribed a nourishing formula for Qi in the morning and the Six Flavor Pill in the evening, occasionally adding Dang Gui&#39;s blood tonic. After half a year, he was finally cured.<a id="trans-320p" href="#orig-320p" class="marker">[320p]</a><br>Zhao Zhou had a hanging abscess, with swelling and pain persisting for more than five months. He experienced heat in the afternoon, dry mouth, night sweats, reduced appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a floating, rapid, and weak pulse, indicating a deficiency in both qi and blood of the three yin. I prescribed a modified Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added licorice, Schisandra, and Mai Men Dong, for over thirty doses. His appetite improved slowly. I also administered over fifty doses of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, which led to the resolution of the pus and ulcers. Later, due to anger, he felt pain again, had a reduced appetite, and experienced fever. I used the previous medicine again, relying on his constitution, and he made a careful recovery.</p>
<p>A neighbor, thirty years old, had a chancre, and despite repeated requests for treatment, he did not adhere to dietary restrictions. One day, he suddenly had a headache, fever, and spontaneous sweating, and many treated him for typhoid fever with incorrect remedies. When I examined his pulse, it was very wiry, and upon deeper pressure, it was fluctuating. I stated: this condition resides in the Jue Yin, and the prescribed medicines did not correspond to the symptoms. I therefore created Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added gentian, Coptis, and Hu Huang Lian, administering four doses, and his illness dramatically improved.</p>
<p>Associate Scholar Liu Hua Fu occasionally experienced pain in his torso, or white fluids from his orifices, or constipation with difficult urination. Initially, I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added gardenia, Zexie, Coptis, Muku, gentian, and Poria; this was to clear liver fire and guide out damp heat, and his various symptoms gradually improved. Later, due to fatigue, he suddenly experienced chills and fever, indicating further injury to his vital energy, so I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction for stabilization. I also prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish liver blood and invigorate kidney water, resulting in a complete recovery.<a id="trans-321p" href="#orig-321p" class="marker">[321p]</a><br>The governor of the province, Jiang Jie, suffered from a syphilis-like ailment, with pus and fluid oozing, thirst and phlegm, chills in the morning, and fever in the afternoon. I said: &quot;The chills in the morning indicate a deficiency of yang energy, while the afternoon fever indicates insufficient yin blood.&quot; He did not believe me and instead took medicines like Er Chen and Huangbo, eating even less, with unsatisfactory bowel movements. Additionally, he experienced heat and thirst in the late afternoon, heaviness and dragging in the lower abdomen, and pain at the affected site. I then prescribed Siwu Decoction with added Huangbo and Zhimu, but he still had no appetite. I diagnosed him with spleen deficiency leading to descent, so I first used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the spleen and stomach to elevate the yang energy, and his symptoms gradually improved. I also prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidney water, thereby generating liver blood and achieving recovery.</p>
<p>A fifteen-year-old boy suffered from a syphilis-like ailment and had been treated with various disinfectants, presenting all signs of deficiency for over two years. Upon inquiry, I found it was inherited. I used Bi Xie Decoction for a month, and the symptoms gradually improved. Later, I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, resulting in full recovery.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar experienced itching in the groin, fever, fatigue, and swelling of the skin for two years. I used Ba Zhen with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and he recovered. For another scholar, who developed itching in the hair due to parasitic infection, I advised him to grind peach kernels into a paste and apply it.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar suffered from a syphilis-like condition due to overwork, with burning pain, chills and fever, fatigue, and headache, as well as red and painful urination. I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Che Qian, Niu Xi, and Shan Zhi, and he was cured.<a id="trans-322p" href="#orig-322p" class="marker">[322p]</a><br>A scholar had a rotting penis that was swollen and painful without end, experiencing intense heat in the afternoons, dry mouth, body fatigue, reduced appetite, and nausea. This was due to deficiency of liver and spleen blood. First, administer the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, which awakens the spleen and stomach, alleviating the symptoms. Further, add Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with fried Shan Zhi, which resolves the liver fire and heals the swelling and pain.</p>
<p>An elderly man had an illness causing painful urination, with a thin pulse and body fatigue. This was due to concurrent deficiency of qi and damp-heat. Administer the Qing Xin Lian Zi Decoction and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he was cured.</p>
<p>A weak person experienced pain in the lower abdomen with painful urination. This was due to dryness from fire and a lack of blood in the lower jiao, preventing the qi from descending, hence the inability to urinate. Using Si Wu Decoction with Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Fu Ling, Niu Xi, and Mu Tong administered ten times, the pain stopped and urination was restored.</p>
<p>The late monarch suffered from shortness of breath, pain in the abdomen, and difficulty urinating. Prepare Si Wu Decoction with Ren Shen and Huang Qi, and boil and swallow Shen Jin Wan for recovery. The previous symptoms stemmed from deficiency at the root, while the illness was secondary; by nourishing the root, the secondary issues resolve themselves. If one does not reinforce the original qi, focusing solely on the disease, it would harm one’s condition deeply.</p>
<p>Wang Jinyi, over forty, had a long-standing problem with a humid and painful condition, feeling fatigued. With Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Huang Lian, Huang Bo, Qing Pi, and Dang Gui, he achieved recovery.</p>
<p>Du, a scholar named Jing, over thirty, had a damp and itchy scrotum with a discharge resembling pus that caused acute pain when erect; this was diagnosed as liver hernia. He used Long Dan Jie Gan Decoction, which led to recovery. Any conditions of swelling, shrinking, or itching of the penis can also be treated with this medicine.<a id="trans-323p" href="#orig-323p" class="marker">[323p]</a><br>The king suffers from prolonged fatigue and increased distress due to an internal abscess. After taking a heart-calming lotus seed drink and a detoxifying herbal mixture, there was no improvement. I prescribed a decoction of eight precious herbs, adding yam, cornelian cherry, and other herbs over ten doses, which gradually led to recovery. Additionally, by using a pilule of prepared Tuckahoe, the issue ultimately resolved completely. A patrol officer also experienced this ailment, claiming that the various medicines were ineffective; however, he was cured after taking a treatment of Ludan Valley and a mixture of eight ingredients.</p>
<p>A man had a hard and painful sore due to a lower genital ulcer, accompanied by chills and fever. First, he received two doses of ginseng-based detoxifying powder, which alleviated his condition; then he was treated with Xiao Chai Hu decoction combined with coptis and green peel, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another man had a lower genital ulcer that had ruptured, causing swelling and pain, with red and frequent urination. He initially took a modified Long Dan decoction that included green peel and coptis, resulting in slight improvement. He then took Xiao Chai Hu decoction with huangbo, anemone, angelica, and poria, which resulted in complete recovery.</p>
<p>One man experienced itching in his genital area due to fatigue, with occasional white discharge and symptoms of fever and dry mouth. He was treated with the heart-calming lotus seed drink, leading to stability.</p>
<p>A man with a ruptured lower genital ulcer experienced swelling, pain, and fever, which intensified in the afternoon. He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu decoction incorporating coptis, anemone, and angelica, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A man fully recovered from his lower genital ulcer but retained a persistent lump in his genital area. He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu decoction with green peel, schizonepeta, and fangfeng. Additionally, he applied a decoction made from equal parts of schizonepeta, fangfeng, ox knee, fallopia, talc, and licorice as a wash, which ultimately led to eradication of the lump.<a id="trans-324p" href="#orig-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a><br>A man had swelling of the penis that would not subside; another man experienced ulceration, swelling, pain, fever, and difficulty urinating, with occasional heat in the evening; yet another child had swelling and pain, unresponsive to various medicines. Each of them took Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Aloe pills several times and recovered.</p>
<p>One man had painful swelling of the penis, urination like dripping, severe spontaneous sweating, and occasionally a little blood in the urine, with a pulse that was rapid and forceful, yielding a feeling of weakness when pressed. He was first treated with Clear Heart Lotus Seed Drink, adding Niu Xi, Shan Zhi, Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, and several doses of Chai Hu, which resulted in slight improvement; further treatment with a dose of Nourishing Kidney Pill led to a complete cure.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of the Jade Machine&quot; states: When there is spontaneous sweating and reduced urination, one should not use medicine to promote urination. If spontaneous sweating occurs, bodily fluids have been lost externally, resulting in diminished urination. If one promotes urination, the nourishing and protective Qi will become depleted, failing to control heat, which will worsen the irritability and heat. One should wait for the heat to recede and sweating to cease before urination resumes. Moreover, this condition pertains to the Yangming meridian, and promoting urination is decidedly contraindicated.</p>
<p>One man had swelling of the penis, or experienced pain, or had a persistent erection; another man felt pain in the penis, with tight and shortened sinews or itchiness, and white discharge resembling semen that followed urination. This indicates a hernia of the sinews, which could be treated successfully with Longdan Decoction. Zhang Zihe stated: Involuntary urination and urinary retention, impotence, and slippery white discharge are all types of hernia in men, and should not be casually attributed to cold in the kidneys. If there is excessive blood loss over the month, after the menstruation ends, there may be heat in the lower back and knees, numbness in the feet, dryness in the throat, urinary retention, a mass in the lower abdomen that may be fixed or moveable, protrusion of the vulva, or hemorrhoids in the rectum—these are all hernias in women. However, women do not refer to them as hernias but call them masses.<a id="trans-325p" href="#orig-325p" class="marker">[325p]</a><br>A man suffered from a toxic condition related to his bowels, characterized by swelling that did not rupture. I thought this was due to weakened yang energy, so I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to replenish the original qi. I added angelica dahurica, soapberry thorns, bupleurum, and licorice root to disperse pus and clear the liver, and after several doses, it began to rupture; then I used the Eight Treasure Decoction with added bupleurum to nourish his qi and blood, and he was cured after several doses.</p>
<p>Judge Hu suffered from the same toxic condition, with thin pus and a weak pulse. I prescribed the Great Comprehensive Decoction with added five-flavor fruit, wheat husk, and white polyporus for thirty doses, and he improved slightly. I later used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria paste to stabilize his condition. However, soon after marriage, the condition recurred, with a hard lump, cold limbs, a weak pulse, and cold skin, along with decreased appetite and excessive thinking, indicating extreme deficiency. I still employed the previous remedies, adding cinnamon and prepared Aconitum for three doses, which improved him somewhat. He wanted a quick recovery and used a self-prepared Lonicera detoxifying drink, which led to continuous diarrhea and his demise.</p>
<p>Wang Wenyuan from the capital, over forty years old and accustomed to hard work, suffered from a toxic bowel condition with chills and fever. Initially, I administered Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added pomelo peel, and after one dose, the surface symptoms completely receded. Next, I used a decoction to strengthen the center and benefit qi, with added pangolin for two doses, and the swelling decreased by three or four. Finally, I used medications to discharge pus for five or six doses, leading to the pus being formed and dispelled, and after ten days, he improved significantly.<a id="trans-326p" href="#orig-326p" class="marker">[326p]</a><br>One person had a carbuncle that was swollen but did not burst; using a combination of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and other herbs, it eventually burst, and afterwards, with the Eight Treasure Decoction plus additional herbs, he was cured.</p>

<p>An elderly woman had a painful carbuncle without pus, accompanied by urinary retention; her liver pulse was rapid. Using a modified Longdan decoction with additional gardenia and bulpleurum, her condition improved after four doses.</p>
<p>A scholar had a carbuncle that was painful and accompanied by frequent urination; two doses of the Eight Correcting Powder were used to clear liver fire and drain damp heat, resulting in improvement. Furthermore, using a small Chaihu decoction with additional angelica, ligusticum, alisma, and gardenia for two doses, his liver fire was cleared and spleen blood was replenished, leading to improved urination.</p>
<p>A man had a carbuncle that burst and was persistently painful; this was due to residual toxins. Taking a Life-saving Decoction led to pain relief, and with a second dose, the swelling subsided.</p>
<p>Another man with a painful carbuncle accompanied by fever took the aforementioned decoction for pain relief, and with another dose of a powerful herb combination including gardenia and bupleurum, he experienced resolution of his symptoms.</p>
<p>One final man had a carbuncle that had burst but remained painful, with constipation; this indicated unresolved liver fire. He was given a small Chaihu decoction supplemented with yellow bitters, anemone, ligusticum, and angelica, which relieved pain and improved urination; afterwards, the Tuili Decoction led to the wound&#39;s closure. If pain persists without resolution, a Life-saving Decoction should be used to clear it.<a id="trans-327p" href="#orig-327p" class="marker">[327p]</a><br>A person experienced a toxic condition, with pus not fully formed, suffering great pain. They took a detoxifying medication, but it did not respond. The pulse was strong and large, indicating the toxin was still present.

<p>Another person had a toxin that had ruptured and caused persistent pain, with various medications ineffective. Upon examination, the pulse was large, and upon palpation, it was rapid, indicating the toxin was unresolved. A dose of Xianfang Huomai Decoction stopped the pain, followed by another dose that led to resolution.</p>
<p>A person presented with toxic swelling and pain, accompanied by a fever in the afternoon. After administering four doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qingpi and Tianhuafen, the pain ceased and the fever receded. Four more doses of Shenxiao Lousan resulted in resolution.</p>
<p>Shen Niwen, twenty years old, suffered from a left-sided toxin. I determined it was due to liver and kidney yin deficiency and initially used a detoxifying medication, which ruptured and began to heal. However, after entering a room, he developed a fever and thirst, and pain also appeared on the right side. The pus was thin and clear, and all signs of deficiency emerged with a strong yet weak pulse, a dire situation. I prescribed Shiquan Dabu Decoction with an added qian of Fuzi; the pulse symptoms immediately improved, and with another dose, they fully receded. Later, he took over thirty doses of a revitalizing decoction and recovered completely.</p>
<p>Another individual had toxic swelling and pain, with chills and fevers. Two doses of Jingfang Baidu San were administered, which alleviated the symptoms, followed by two doses of Shuangjie San, leading to resolution.</p>
<p>Another person had a painful swelling from a toxin, with constipation and a strong pulse. Two doses of Yuzhu San resulted in rapid improvement, followed by four doses of Long Dan Xie Gan Tang, which resolved the condition.</p>
<p>One individual tried to eliminate the toxin internally with a harsh medication, resulting in diarrhea, diminished appetite. Two Shen Pills were first used to stop the diarrhea, followed by Shiquan Dabu Decoction with increased Bai Zhu and Fu Ling, leading to resolution after several doses.<a id="trans-328p" href="#orig-328p" class="marker">[328p]</a><br>A woman of simple, harsh life suffered from anger and resulting toxicity. Some used cooling and toxin-expelling medicine, which instead caused internal heat, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, irregular menstruation, and dry mouth and throat. I suggested that this stagnant qi harmed the spleen and further hurt by medication. I first prescribed several doses of Angelica Decoction, followed by over fifty doses of Xiaoyao Powder, at which point all symptoms improved.</p>
<p>A scholar named Ling Daizhi, over forty years old, suffered from toxicity, excess exertion, little appetite, unsatisfactory bowel movements, and weak pulse. Dongyuan states: slippery essence cannot be contained, leading to spontaneous bowel movement, heavy waist and legs, indicating deficiency below. Zhongjing says: a weak pulse indicates both qi and blood deficiency. I first administered Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoction with added toasted paper and nutmeg to stop diarrhea, and improve appetite; then I gave over ten doses of the Complete Ginseng and Tonifying Decoction combined with menstrual herbs, which resolved his condition.</p>
<p>A man developed a swollen abscess that impeded urination, prompting urgent acupuncture treatment. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Huangbai, Baizhi, and Jin Yinhua in four doses, which provided slight relief, followed by several doses of Tuoli Xiaodu Powder for a complete recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen scrotum resembling crystal, with intermittent pain and itching, accompanied by fluid discharge. Pressing the lower abdomen made a water sound, and there was frequent urination with a slow pulse. This condition resulted from excessive drinking and sweating after intoxication exposed to wind, leading to a gathering of cold, damp, and toxicity in the scrotum, termed water hernia. Initially, I gave two doses of Water-Expelling Pills, which resolved abdominal fluid and returned urination to normal; then I prescribed Weiling Powder, increasing the amounts of Bai Zhu and Fu Ling, and finally used qi acupuncture to draw out the accumulated fluid, achieving a cure.<a id="trans-329p" href="#orig-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a><br>A weak person has a cystic abscess that has not yet produced pus, accompanied by red and painful urination. After taking four doses of licorice, green peels, houttuynia, rhizoma coptidis, angelica, and ophiopogon, there was slight improvement; then by drinking a clear heart lotus seed decoction, it was resolved.</p>
<p>A man has a cystic abscess, with severe swelling and pain, red urination, fever, and a rapid pulse. Using Longdan Xiegan Decoction, with increased amounts of plantago seed, alisma, houttuynia, and poria, the condition diminished by half; with the same decoction, but adding rhizoma coptidis and honeysuckle on top, it reduced further to two or three doses, and urination returned to normal, but one area remained unresolved, indicating it would turn to pus. Using the previous decoction again, adding honeysuckle, angelica, and soapweed prickly ash for six doses caused slight swelling and pain, with a slippery and rapid pulse, indicating pus had formed, and needed lancing; after this, the swelling and pain completely receded. Nourishing yin and detoxifying medicines were applied, along with powdered perilla, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another man had a cystic abscess with severe condition, and a pulse that was ominously strong. He received two doses of the previous decoction, and the swelling reduced. Two doses of Xianfang Huoming Decoction helped with the pain. Upon examining his pulse, it was slippery and rapid, indicating pus had formed and required lancing; otherwise, the scrotum would ulcerate. Although he doubted my words and opted to see another doctor, ultimately he suffered severe rupture and had his testicles hanging. After seeking treatment again, his pulse seemed calmer. Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus, rhizoma coptidis, anemarrhena, and gardenia, along with powdered perilla, resulted in recovery in several days. Though this condition was daunting, it frequently ended without loss, so patients should not fear.<a id="trans-330p" href="#orig-330p" class="marker">[330p]</a><br>A weak person suffered from a pouch abscess, which had become swollen and painful with purulent accumulation, and they experienced urgent constipation. After being needled, about three bowls of pus were expelled, and the person fell into a deep sleep. Upon waking, their spirit was slightly restored. However, the needles were delayed, and although detoxifying medicines were applied, everything was still in a state of decay. Therefore, the use of the Pungent Resisting Medicine was necessary, with over thirty doses administered before healing occurred. Generally speaking, this condition pertains to a deficiency of the yin, with damp-heat causing obstruction, hence medicines to nourish yin and dispel dampness cannot be neglected. When treating swelling and pain with constipation, the primary approach is damp-dispelling, supplemented by yin-nourishing. Once the swelling and pain have subsided and urination is normalized, a combination of damp-dispelling and yin-nourishing medicines is used. If pus is desired, the focus should be on the Pungent Resisting Medicine, with yin-nourishing as a supplement. Once the pus is formed, needling is again applied, alongside the Pungent Resisting and yin-nourishing medicines. Once dampness and toxins have been eliminated, solely the Pungent Resisting Medicine is used. If the pus is clear or if the condition is progressing slowly, large tonifying medicines along with fermented soybean cakes or aconite cakes can be applied.</p>
<p>Lu Wuxuan, the Lord of the Liang, who was over fifty years of age, suffered from a pouch abscess, and the sore did not close for over a year. Upon diagnosis, there was slight damp-heat present, and he was treated with Longdan Xie Gan Decoction, after which the damp-heat completely retreated. He was then treated with the Pungent Resisting Medicine and moxibustion with fermented soybean cakes, leading to recovery. The following year, he again suffered from substantial damp-heat and was treated with four doses of the previous decoction, which resulted in significant reduction of the condition, and then he was treated with yin-nourishing medicines for resolution. If after the rupture he remains deficient without proper supplementation, younger patients may develop leaks, while older and weaker patients may not recover. If the pus is clear and the craving for water is strong, with a large pulse, the treatment is also not given.<a id="trans-331p" href="#orig-331p" class="marker">[331p]</a><br>Hutong, from Shaanxi, over fifty years old, experienced swelling and pain in the scrotum, worsening with heat. Treatments with Pancong San and similar medicines were ineffective; the pulse was rapid. This was an abscess in the scrotum caused by damp-heat in the liver channel. Pus had formed, so urgent needling was performed, and Longdan Xiegan Decoction was administered, leading to improvement in pulse and symptoms. Furthermore, nourishing Yin medicines were added, along with external applications of fir ash and perilla powder. After a month, he recovered. Although this condition burst severely, it was not harmful, and the patient was able to manage it carefully.</p>
<p>Another official aged over sixty had unbearable pain from a scrotal rupture, with the testicles exposed. He was given Longdan Xiegan Decoction and had applications of wheat charcoal and perilla powder, but there was no improvement. I believed this indicated excessive dampness, so first a bowl of Sophora japonica flower wine was given, followed by the decoction, leading to slight recovery; then nourishing Yin medicines were added, and after a month, he regained stability. If the previous medicine had been ineffective, employing harsh measures would likely have weakened the middle Qi, causing further harm.</p>
<p>One individual, drinking for consecutive days, had damp pruritus in the scrotum. Nourishing Yin medicines were prescribed but did not take effect. I inferred this to be related to the liver meridian of the lower Yin, where the genitalia protruded. He had a history of dampness, and the subsequent alcohol intake resulted in a combination of damp-heat in the lower jiao. The classics state: “The lower jiao is like a drain,” and also say: “Those below should be drawn out.” Therefore, Longdan Xiegan Decoction and Qingzhen Decoction were used, leading to curing. If these did not suffice, it would be prudent to switch to Liver Nourishing Decoction and Sisheng San for treatment.<a id="trans-332p" href="#orig-332p" class="marker">[332p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar named Chen Shiyong, after failing an exam, drank liquor one evening and went to bed, but his wife did not receive him. The next day, he experienced swelling and pain in his scrotum and sent someone to seek treatment. I prescribed a remedy to clear damp heat and liver fire. The city gates were closed at night, and he could not return in time to take the medication. The following morning, it was reported that during the night his scrotum had completely rotted, and the area beneath the glans was also rotting. This was due to liver fire combined with alcohol toxicity and excessive damp heat. I then added ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to the previous medicine. The rotten flesh fell off completely, and the testicles were hanging. I used a great tonic for qi and blood and applied angelica ointment, leading to the complete recovery of the scrotum.</p>
<p>Liang Zhenshan, a palace attendant, suffered from a scrotal abscess, which was swollen, red, painful, and accompanied by difficult urination, alternating chills and fever, and thirst. This was due to yin deficiency of the liver and kidneys with damp heat descending. Hence, I decided to clear the liver fire and eliminate the damp toxins. I prescribed chih-shu, roasted gentian, evodia, roasted coptis, angelica, honeysuckle, soapberry thorn, red peony, ledev, akebia, and licorice. After one dose, the swelling and pain gradually subsided. I added a bit more ledev and akebia, alongside chuanxiong and poria, to make a drink, which nourished the kidney essence. The heat and swelling both retreated. However, there remained a thread of tissue that did not dissolve; this was due to deficiency in blood and qi of the liver channel. I needed to nourish the kidney water, so I used a formula of six ingredients, substituting poria with five flavors, and then made another drink with a tonic to enhance qi, adding poria. With these, the tissue disappeared completely, and he was healed.<a id="trans-333p" href="#orig-333p" class="marker">[333p]</a><br>A man from Jingzhao, named Zhu Erfeng, experienced swelling and pain in the scrotum, which he believed to be hernia. Upon examining his pulse, which was rapid and slippery, I determined this to be a scrotal abscess. It arose from deficiency in the liver and kidney meridians, combined with damp-heat; pus had already formed. After taking a dose of the Vitality Elixir, it burst, and I prescribed herbs to nourish yin and expel toxins to heal it.</p>
<p>Another client, consuming rich foods, had a swollen scrotum and difficulty urinating, indicating accumulated heat in the middle jiao. This was compounded by a deficiency allowing it to descend. Initially, I used Longdan Decoction to clear the liver, adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Huanglian, and Niuxi. Gradually, he improved. Later, I prescribed Baizhen Decoction combined with Chaihu and Shanzhizi, leading to recovery. However, due to disregarding dietary restrictions, he relapsed, for which I again used Baizhen Decoction, concurrently applying Zhongyi Qi-ing Decoction and Six Flavor Pill, achieving cure. Due to overexertion causing heat, he self-medicated with Sibai, Huangbo, and Zhimu, resulting in all symptoms manifesting and the ulcer situation worsening. I indicated his five organs were deficient in qi and blood. I prescribed Zhongyi Qi-ing for the morning and Liu Junzi with Danggui for the evening, using over fifty doses, leading to gradual closure of the ulcer, followed by Six Flavor Pill for regulation, resulting in healing.</p>
<p>A man entered the room inebriated, presenting with a swollen scrotum as large as a bowl, abdominal distension, difficult urination with redness, fever, and dryness in the mouth, significantly obstructed phlegm. This highlighted a deficiency of the bladder yin, under threat from wine toxins. I utilized Six Flavor Pill augmented with Cheqian and Niuxi as drinks, supplemented with Zizhuan Wan to nourish the kidneys, causing the symptoms to abate. I added doses of Wuweizi and Maidong, achieving recovery. Later, I employed Zhongyi Qi-ing Decoction with Maidong and Wuweizi for convalescence. However, using mild diuretics could further damage the true yin, which would surely lead to repercussions.<a id="trans-334p" href="#orig-334p" class="marker">[334p]</a><br>The Prefect Wang Ruda experienced a fever early in the day, felt fatigued, and, when he entered the room, his legs became weak and his soles hot, extending to his knees. His pulse was rapid and full, particularly at the two wrist positions. I diagnosed him with deficiency in the three yin channels and aimed to nourish and restore his vital source. However, he took bitter and cold medications to reduce heat, which led to swelling in the scrotum. Treatment with hernia medicine aggravated the swelling, worsening his already weak constitution. I then used warming and tonifying medicines, but the swelling and pain escalated, causing difficulty with urination, and the pulse at the two wrists was also rapid and slippery, feeling very weak upon palpation.</p>
<p>I said: &quot;This is a suppurative abscess that cannot rupture due to the deficiency of qi and blood.&quot; I first prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Chinese yam, dogwood fruit, plantain seeds, bupleurum, and gardenia. After one dose, the swelling significantly reduced. Next, I used the Six Flavor Pill with additional plantain, ox knee, bupleurum, and gardenia. After one dose, urination gradually improved. I then combined the Lifesaving Decoction with the previous two medicines, and after more than twenty doses, the abscess burst, releasing a considerable amount of foul pus. I then used the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder for six doses to clear the pus and filth. With additional doses of the Tuo Li Powder, the pus volume decreased. Finally, I used the Bu Yin Tuo Li Powder and the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction for more than fifty doses, after which he was cured.</p>
<p>One individual, not careful in his bedroom endeavors, developed painful swelling from toxic excrement. I prescribed the Double Relief Powder in two doses to relieve the pain, which stopped immediately. I then used the Bu Zhong Decoction for several doses until pus formed, which I then needled. After using the Eight Treasure Decoction with additional five-flavored fruit, Ophiopogon japonicus, and bupleurum for more than thirty doses, he recovered.<a id="trans-335p" href="#orig-335p" class="marker">[335p]</a><br>Zhang Jingzhi, a resident of Tongfu, suffered from a persistent abscess that failed to heal. He experienced significant heat in the afternoon, thirst, and restlessness. Some prescribed Si Wu Decoction, with ingredients like Huangbo and Zhimu, but it only worsened his symptoms. He felt weak, had a reduced appetite, and experienced unformed stools and frequent urination. He asked me what the issue was. I replied that this was a sign of spleen deficiency, and the previous medication had further harmed him. I then used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Fu Ling and Ban Xia for several doses. His diet gradually improved, and his symptoms began to recover. I further added Mai Dong and Wu Wei to regulate his condition, resulting in his eventual recovery. The classics state that the spleen belongs to Taiyin, is earthy and governs the production of blood. Therefore, Mr. Dongyuan said that in cases of spleen deficiency, with sinking of the vital energy, manifested as fever, thirst, and fatigue, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to uplift and nourish Yang energy, thereby promoting the production of Yin blood. If mistakenly considered as kidney deficiency and treated with Si Wu, Huangbo, and Zhimu, it would instead harm the spleen and stomach, exacerbating the deficiency. Moreover, Huangbo and Zhimu are ingredients that drain Yang and nourish Yin; if there is not an excess of Yang fire in the bladder failing to produce Yin fluids, leading to fever, they should not be used.</p>
<p>A man over fifty suffered from an abscess with clear pus and had weak liver and kidney pulses. This was due to carelessness regarding alcohol and passion, leading to damp heat stagnation. However, with clear pus and weak pulses, and at an old age, how could he be treated effectively? Furthermore, the valley path is where the Ren channel originates, and it is the gathering place for the liver meridian; thus, treatment would be difficult, and he ultimately died. In treating this abscess, I found that water from the stream combined with licorice was effective; if it had ruptured, using Shiquan Dabu Decoction would be essential.<a id="trans-336p" href="#orig-336p" class="marker">[336p]</a><br>A scholar suffered from a hanging sore and took Kanli pills, along with herbs such as Siwu, Huangbo, and Zhimu, but saw no response. His pulse was floating and strong, but when pressed, it was weak and thin. I believed it was the result of deficiency in the three Yin. I used Tori San and then Bu Yin Tori San, and he gradually improved; later, I prescribed Liu Wei Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish and restore his vitality, and he healed within half a year. Generally, for sores and similar conditions, if the Yang Qi of the kidney is excessive, causing the Yin fluid to fail to transform, leading to symptoms of Yin deficiency and fever, it is appropriate to use Kanli pills, as their bitter and cold properties can drain the internal fire of water, allowing the Yang Qi to weaken, thereby facilitating the generation of water. Conversely, if the Yang Qi is weak, preventing the transformation of Yin fluid and causing the same symptoms, Liu Wei Wan should be used, whose sour and warming qualities can generate the water within fire, allowing the Yang Qi to flourish, naturally enabling the emergence of Yin. Moreover, cases like this, attributed to the depletion of essence and Qi in the kidney, occur in 80 to 90 percent of patients, while those due to excessive Yang Qi in the kidney occur only 1 or 2 percent of the time. However, among people in Jiangnan suffering from this condition, many belong to the spleen channel, experiencing depletion of Yin blood and descent of original Qi. It is essential to use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to raise and nourish the Yang Qi, enabling the growth of Yin. If there is excessive desire leading to depletion of true water, Liu Wei Wan should be employed to replenish the original Qi of the kidney and generate essence and blood, along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the vital Qi of the spleen and lungs, thereby enriching the kidney&#39;s water. The classics say that those with Yin deficiency also have spleen deficiency. Yet, many mistakenly believe it to be a fire condition of the kidney channel, using Huangbo and Zhimu, further damaging the spleen and lungs, cutting off their sources of transformation, leading to further deterioration. How regrettable!<a id="trans-337p" href="#orig-337p" class="marker">[337p]</a><br>Mr. Liu Kexin from the Upper House developed a carbuncle, which after bursting caused pain, fever, dry mouth, and reddish urine. He, being self-assured in his medical knowledge, used cooling and antiseptic medicines which were ineffective. He then invited me to diagnose him; I found his left pulse to be strong and rapid, leading me to believe that his yang energy was strong while his yin energy was weak. I first prescribed the Four Herbs Decoction with additions of Huangbo and Zhimu, to drain the excess yang and allow the yin to replenish. After taking several doses, his symptoms gradually improved. Later, I used the Restore the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction and the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to tonify the spleen and lungs and nourish the kidney&#39;s water, leading to the healing of the sore.<a id="trans-338p" href="#orig-338p" class="marker">[338p]</a><br>A scholar suffered from a hanging sore, with symptoms including reddish, painful urination, weakness and swelling in the feet after exertion, fever, dry mouth, parched tongue, reduced appetite, and fatigue worsening by evening. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood unable to resolve the issue. Thus, an Eight Treasures Decoction was used, supplemented with wheat kernel and yam, and a higher dosage of prepared licorice was administered. All symptoms gradually subsided, but the affected area remained swollen and painful, indicating pus formation within. After five doses, the pus began to discharge, and after more than fifty doses, the sore was nearly healed. However, due to labor and discontinuation of medicine, he experienced chills and fever, increased thirst, and significant swelling and pain with more pus. A tonic was prepared using the Middle Qi Benefiting Decoction, adding roasted gardenia for two doses, which provided slight improvement. Following this, the Eight Treasures Decoction was augmented with Ophiopogon and Schisandra for over a hundred doses, leading to the complete resolution of swelling and pain. He was pleased with his careful lifestyle, moderation in diet, and consistent use of tonics, which maintained his well-being. Yet, with exertion, one or two drops of pus would still emerge. Later, influenced by external advice, he took internal medications to purge fire and external applications to erode the sore, attempting to restrict it, which resulted in a severe breakdown of the affected area, nearly incapacitating him, but ultimately he restored and healed through tonics.</p>
<p>The &quot;Textbook of Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from a hanging sore for over ten days, with swelling and pain progressing to significant fever in the evening and difficulty urinating. Two doses of Longdan Xiegan Decoction were given, slightly alleviating urination but leaving lingering pain, indicating impending pus formation. Two doses of Tori Xiaodu Powder were then administered, augmented with pangolin scales, soapberry thorns, and Alisma, leading to pus discharge. He was also treated with the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction, and after a month, the condition resolved.<a id="trans-339p" href="#orig-339p" class="marker">[339p]</a><br>A man suffered from a hanging sore, which was severely swollen and painful. Pus had formed inside; when it was pricked, foul-smelling pus came out, and the pain significantly diminished. After taking the Shiquan Dabu Decoction for over ten doses, his diet gradually improved, and the swelling subsided. However, the wound remained severely ulcerated and did not heal easily. Occasionally, he took licorice pills with wax and alum, and applied aconite cakes for moxibustion. After three months of treatment, he recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had an internal swelling for four days, experiencing slight itching and pain. He took a dose of Jiulong Dan, which relieved his condition five or six times, gradually reducing the swelling. He then took Siwu Decoction with added pollen, Rhizoma Coptidis, and Anemarrhena as a cure.</p>
<p>A man had a hard and painful lump, with difficulty in urination and bowel movements. After one dose of Jiulong Dan, his symptoms eased slightly, and after taking another dose the next day, both urination and bowel movements improved, reducing the lump.</p>
<p>A man had a fish mouth for over ten days, and the condition worsened. Due to an urgent public matter, he couldn&#39;t walk. Using the fire needle technique, he was treated, releasing purple blood. He applied a medicated plaster and expelled some pus. After taking the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder, he could walk again and recovered quickly.</p>
<p>Another man had a fish mouth that was ulcerated and large, not closing properly; this was due to excessive use of laxatives. He took Shiquan Dabu Decoction, adding Ze Xie and Dan Pi for over ten doses, and applied a medicated ointment called Yuhong Gao. After more than a month, the wound closed.<a id="trans-340p" href="#orig-340p" class="marker">[340p]</a><br>A man first developed sores that did not heal for a long time and later suffered from a swelling that became painful after more than ten days. I wanted to let the pus out to release the toxic gases. He preferred to treat it internally, taking medicine such as locust flower wine, centipedes, and scorpions. The swelling did not lessen, his vital energy diminished, leading to pain in the muscles and bones, making movement difficult. He requested treatment again. He was thin and weak, with a weak and rapid pulse, indicating true vitality was injured, allowing evil energies to enter him. Although nourishment was needed, he would inevitably suffer from sores again before healing. Skeptical, he continued to take medicines like anti-toxic and wind-dispelling herbs, which further weakened his vitality. He couldn’t eat, experienced severe pain in his muscles and bones, and was unable to sleep through the night, requesting treatment once more. </p>
<p>I first used the “Buzhong Yiqi Decoction” with doubled ginseng and astragalus, which slightly revived his vitality. Then, I applied &quot;Ba Zhen Decoction&quot; with added Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Yuan Zhi, Suan Zao Ren, and Dan Pi over ten doses. He could finally sleep at night, but the pain persisted. This was due to internal deficiency and toxic sores sinking, making it difficult to achieve results. In the morning, he took the “Liu Wei Wan,” and at noon, the “Shi Quan Da Bu Tang,” continuing for more than ten doses. Red spots appeared all over his body, indicating the toxicity was trying to surface. I continued with the previous medication, and the red spots gradually rose, starting to form sores. When the toxic sores finally erupted, the pain suddenly diminished, and his vitality gradually recovered. I further prescribed the “Ba Zhen Tang” with added Lou Ren, Jin Hua, and Tu Fu Ling. After taking this for half a year, his sores gradually healed. He regretted insisting on his own treatment methods and began to appreciate the wonders of appropriate medicinal prescriptions.<a id="trans-341p" href="#orig-341p" class="marker">[341p]</a><br>A man suffered from wind-cold without being dispersed, which led to swelling and severe pain in the kidney area. He took a dose of Wàn Lìng Dān, bathed and sweat, causing the cold evil to recede. Then he used Si Wù Tāng combined with Zé Xiè, Cāng Zhú, Shān Zhī, and Tiān Huā Fěn, applying the Ruyi Jīn Huáng Sàn several times until it completely disappeared.</p>
<p>A man had a large cyst, which was neither hot nor painful; it felt soft when pressed and then returned to its shape. This was due to dampness collecting without dispersing. A Beryllium needle was used to draw out about a bowl&#39;s worth of yellow fluid; he also took a medicinal pill designed to dissolve water in the kidneys, and after a month, the swelling disappeared. Further, he took Mù Xiāng Bǔ Shèn Wán without complications.</p>
<p>Another man suffered from this condition for over ten days with significant swelling and pain, and pus had formed inside. After being needled, about a bowl&#39;s worth of pus was discharged. He took more than ten doses of Shí Quán Dà Bǔ Tāng with Zé Xiè and Dān Pí, which then helped to close up the issue.</p>
<p>An elderly man with a history of hernia experienced severe pain after becoming angry, which affected his liver. He took a cooling remedy made from scallions, but the swelling and pain worsened. Upon examination, half of the kidney area felt hard, and the skin showed purple-black discoloration, indicating it was about to rot, potentially affecting the testicles. He was skeptical and insisted on internal treatment, seeking another doctor. He took Lóng Dǎn Xiè Gān Tāng internally, while applying Sì Huáng Sàn and other cooling medicines externally. The hardened area indeed began to rot, with poor appetite, insomnia from internal heat, and severe pain leading to dizziness. He sought treatment again. I said: In all illnesses, there are roots and branches, and treatment must be appropriate. Initially treating the hernia with medicine was misguided, for it wasn’t a hernia. The symptoms of a hernia include lower abdominal pain, pulling in the kidneys, often cold and less hot, preferring warm soup. This condition stemmed from anger harming the liver, resulting in the yin being deficient, with dampness and heat causing problems.<a id="trans-342p" href="#orig-342p" class="marker">[342p]</a><br>The sac is swollen and warm, with dark red urine, internal heat and dry mouth, a feeling of heaviness and pain—these are symptoms of a sac abscess. Initially, it is best to clear and relieve the condition for healing. However, if one uses the hot medicines of the hernia specialists, it may worsen the situation. Once the condition has progressed, one should use nourishing yin and internal expelling treatments, along with liver-clearing and cooling agents. With age, there may be a deficiency in Qi and blood; if one focuses solely on expelling, and neglects to nourish, how could the illness not become life-threatening? One should prioritize nourishing Qi and blood and stabilizing the foundation, supplemented by tranquilizing and pain-relieving medicines to restore vital energy. Life and death hang in the balance of advancing and retreating; thus, a turn for the better is still possible. </p>
<p>The treatment includes the Ba Zhen Decoction with additions of Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Yuan Zhi, and Mu Dan Pi, while externally washing the necrotic tissue with licorice decoction. Any necrotic black flesh should be completely excised, exposing the testicles. After several days, with restoration through nourishment, previous symptoms gradually retreat, dietary intake increases, and external necrosis is eliminated. The kidneys have protruded significantly; apply Jade Red Ointment and cover it with a medicated dressing. Gradually, muscle regrowth begins, and after regulating for half a year, peace is ultimately attained.<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a><br>A man experienced swelling and pain for over ten days, with hardness and no pus; the swelling became purple and rotten, indicating a desire for external decay.

<p>A man who had a history of phlegm-fire took medicines to reduce it for a long time, which led to a swelling and pain in the kidney area; his pulse was thin and rapid, indicating a deficiency of yin with damp heat. After ulceration, it was difficult to contain, and he refused treatment. Eventually, foul pus emerged, worsening day by day, with persistent fevers and inability to eat. He tried to strengthen the middle, invigorate the spleen, and supplement qi and blood, but ultimately did not respond and passed away.</p>
<p>A man suffered from cold affecting him later, which caused pulling pain in the lower abdomen and a feeling of chills and fever. Upon examination, his pulse was tight and rapid yet weak. He was given a dose of Wujisan, and the cold and heat receded while pain eased somewhat. Subsequently, he took Baizhen decoction with added cinnamon, peony, and drain (Ze Xie) several times, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-344p" href="#orig-344p" class="marker">[344p]</a><br>A fifteen-year-old boy suffered from a chancre, his penis swollen and painful, the skin puffy, and twice its normal size. Treatments focused on detoxifying and clearing the liver with various herbs, but the swelling and pain only intensified. Upon examination, I noted a thin, rapid pulse with little strength, indicating a deficiency of vital energy. The dampness from the spleen was overwhelming, causing stagnation and accumulation. Hence, I employed a treatment approach: I combined Si Wu Decoction with Ping Wei San, adding five grams each of Mu Xiang, cooked Fuzi, and Ren Shen. One dose resulted in a swift reduction of swelling and pain, and after four to five doses, it entirely subsided.</p>
<p>A man with a chancre experienced swelling and pain in his penis, accompanied by chills and fever. I administered two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San, which relieved his symptoms. Then I prescribed Long Dan Cao Xie Gan Tang, which also reduced the swelling and pain, followed by Si Wu Decoction with Huangbo and Zhimu, ultimately leading to complete relief.</p>
<p>A forty-year-old man, excessively indulging in sexual desire, suffered from painful, frequent urination with a discharge like white fluid that formed congealed clumps. This indicated damage from damp heat in the kidneys. In the morning, I gave him Ba Wei Wan, and at noon, Ba Zhen Tang with additions of Shan Zhu Yu, Mu Dan Pi, Huangbo, and Zhimu. After a month of treatment, his symptoms of painful urination diminished, and urination gradually became clearer. However, he continued to experience sporadic seminal discharge, with lingering weakness in his lower back and knees. Occasionally, I prescribed San Yin Sheng Jun Wan, and after a month of taking it, all previous symptoms were resolved.<a id="trans-345p" href="#orig-345p" class="marker">[345p]</a><br>A man had a rotten tip of the penis, experiencing painful dribbling.

<p>A man, newly married, sustained an injury to the penis, with severe bleeding and pain. First, he soaked it in scallion soup for a long time, and subsequently used a pearl powder mixed with borneol.

<p>A man experienced swelling of the skin that was shiny and felt hot and painful. He applied a golden powder externally and took Longdan decoction with Da Huang internally, which somewhat alleviated the pain. After removing the Da Huang, he took further treatment and improved.</p>
<p>The text &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: &quot;To nurture the essence of Master Wang Taigong, one&#39;s spirit should be kept inward, and in all matters, one should practice humility and retreat. Reaching the age of seventy, he maintains a youthful appearance, presumably due to a complete reception from heaven without harm from others. Historically, he has only suffered from a weak constitution; he watches his diet closely. In recent years, he developed a hernia in the lower abdomen that resembled a magpie&#39;s egg. After multiple occurrences, it gradually grew larger and longer, easily descending from the lower abdomen into the scrotum, making repositioning difficult. The slightest chill to the lower body would trigger it. Upon onset, it required the clumps of cold air to gradually warm up before it could soften and retract; otherwise, it would bulge at the narrow opening and could not return. Recently, the swelling enlarged further, feeling like a wine bottle lying across the hips, half in the lower abdomen and half in the scrotum, firm and tight like stone, with a pressure radiating to the front and back, causing simultaneous swelling in the meridians around the waist and navel.&quot;<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a><br>Therefore, when the illness attacks the stomach, there will be severe vomiting; when it attacks the top of the head, there will be trembling and fear of cold, and the stability of breathing will be disturbed. Last winter, I observed a sudden onset of symptoms, realizing it was due to the upward invasion of earth qi. I urgently used a strong dose of ginseng, aconite, ginger, and cinnamon to treat it, and it was cured after just one dose. Since then, whenever such symptoms arise, I&#39;ve relied on ginger and cinnamon for quick effects. Now, at the end of May, while Chang was away, his symptoms persisted over several days, so he took more than twenty doses of the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, yet the effects were very slow. However, I doubted the condition&#39;s severity, not the medicine&#39;s efficacy. At this time, Mr. Yu, an elder in the family, was supervising the funds in Zhejiang, and he commented from afar that even with a hundred doses of Shi Quan Da Bu, it would still be effective, so I made a firm decision to continue the treatment. By Mid-Autumn, the symptoms recurred. Chang again used ginger, cinnamon, ginseng, and aconite for results. His son advised Mr. Lao, but both were uncertain of the way forward. Chang requested a deeper explanation of the principles involved. The principle is that when there is yang deficiency, we use the Four Gentlemen; when there is yin deficiency, we use the Four Substances; and when both yin and yang are deficient, we combine the Four Gentlemen and Four Substances, adding flavors to create Shi Quan Da Bu. This is the correct and harmonious way to approach healing.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a><br>As for the stagnant and turbid Yin qi that accumulates in the lower abdomen to form a tangible mass, this indicates an extreme excess of Yin. How can one treat it with methods for Yin deficiency, thereby aiding the pathogen and worsening the illness? Why do I say this? Women who are pregnant may suffer from illnesses like cold damage and, when unavoidable, might use harmful medicines such as hemp, cinnamon, or salts that endanger the fetus. However, if one adds the Four Substances (Si Wu), the harsh medicines can no longer enter the womb to harm the fetus. Can one really desire to eliminate the pathogen within, only to use the Four Substances for protection instead? This is one example. </p>
<p>Every case of lumps or masses leads to a weakened body and depleted blood; despite numerous methods to remove them, there is no improvement. Yet, using the Four Substances results in an immediate increase in the condition. The Four Substances cannot generate or invigorate blood, and merely contribute to worsening the problem—this is another instance. The blood vessels of the human body rely entirely on food and nourishment to grow. The stagnation of the Four Substances affects the spleen, which is not valued by men; given that turbid Yin is already at its peak, when it pulls on the Yin channels, directly impacting the Yang vessels, there is much to be concerned about regarding the encroachment of earth qi. How can one use medicines that are half Yin and half Yang to remedy this? There is no doubt that the inappropriate use of the Four Substances is evident. Even the Four Gentlemen must not be treated lightly in serious cases; one must add the strong effects of ginger, cinnamon, and prepared aconite to truly combat the illness. Why? When Yin pathogens cause harm, if they do not manifest, it’s one thing; but once they erupt, it is certain to be violent.<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a><br>When the weather declines, it becomes clear; when the earth&#39;s energy rises, it becomes murky, and the human body can generally be seen. However, people only perceive the stillness of the earth&#39;s energy and do not see its movement; classical texts speak only of the decline of yin energy but not of its abundance. Physicians, when faced with diseases directly affecting the yin meridians, often do not know how to treat them, let alone with mixed symptoms. Allow me to discuss the principles of heaven and earth for clarification. The principles of heaven and earth are discussed in detail in the book &quot;Yuanhui Yunshi.&quot; As for the theories surrounding the confusion of the cycles of Xu and Hai, I will not elaborate, believing that at that time heaven and earth merge into one, leaving nothing to discuss. Little do they know that heaven does not mix with earth, while earth does mix with heaven. Indeed, even a slight movement of the earth&#39;s energy can lead to disasters such as landslides and floods, causing changes in peaks and valleys. Therefore, when there is a significant movement in the earth&#39;s energy, its thunderous power can strike swiftly, shaking the void with hundreds of thousands of vibrations, crashing and colliding upwards towards the heavens, surely leading to a merging of heaven and earth? It must be that at the &quot;Zi&quot; time, heaven opens, and the earth&#39;s energy descends slightly, allowing the tall and elevated forms to begin to reveal themselves. At the &quot;Chou&quot; time, the earth is opened, the earth&#39;s energy starts to return to the ground, and the vastness of the sky begins to clarify. During that time, if living beings are not yet able to be born, it is because the earth&#39;s energy descends from heaven without being completely purified. Beyond the nine energies of blue, yellow, red, purple, black, white, and green, there are many fierce and pathogenic energies descending from the void, extending thousands of feet in their reach.<a id="trans-349p" href="#orig-349p" class="marker">[349p]</a><br>Just as wood and stone fall straight down, and arrows and crossbows shoot straight, beings do indeed arise within this, yet they are battered and destroyed by various violent forces, preventing them from thriving. Only when the harsh and inferior forces subside, and everything returns to harmony, can beings achieve their growth and gradually move toward繁衍. The cruel and violent nature of阴气, once it arrives at this point, has not been discussed by anyone throughout the ages. How can we know of it? In the &quot;Tripitaka,&quot; the Buddha explains the creation and destruction of the world in detail, and there are no discussions of this kind, as it is already encompassed within the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, requiring no further elaboration. Are not earth, water, fire, and wind one rather than阴邪? The evils of the myriad阴s bring about calamities, the so-called mingling of earthly energies with the heavens is not a mere speculation. Geomancers know to seek the auspicious in the heavenly stems while avoiding the inauspicious in the earthly branches; how then can physicians, who follow the way, fail to consider avoiding calamities when faced with signs of earth energies rising? In the Han Dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing wrote the &quot;Treatise on Sudden Illnesses&quot; in sixteen volumes, but after the fires brought by the troops of Lu Shan, it was lost and not passed down, leaving later generations without the means to see it.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a><br>Chang understood the principles of the vital energy that mingles with the heavens. When encountering the evidence of邪 (evil forces) rising up and solitary yang causing disturbance, he would quickly apply pure yang medicine to urgently drive away the阴气 (yin energy). With a loud sound, it would emerge from great orifices to dispel the universe and reveal the sun and moon, its effectiveness thus made clear. Just as with the experiences of the great elder, who repeatedly applied ginger and aconite, it should not be merely considered a temporary measure, for it is indeed a continual method for all ages. However, the fierce and violent nature of such remedies seems unsuitable for regular use, and even when employed at the right moment, it cannot avoid the drawback of dryness in the mouth and bitteness on the tongue. Those who are hesitant to use it might not be aware of the necessity of its use. Just like warfare, which can destroy the world, if used wisely, the people will follow; if mismanaged, they will rebel. Today, the troops sent to deal with bandits are under constant surveillance and restrictions; their fierce energy has been turned soft and restrained, forcing them into a truce with the bandits. Upon reaching the areas they pass through, they loot everything, leading to thorns and bad harvests, driving away the good people to become bandits themselves. In the halls of power, they cannot cease warfare and have no strategies for battle, and the situation broadly resembles this. Chang suggests that the principles of medicine be mutually considered.<a id="trans-351p" href="#orig-351p" class="marker">[351p]</a><br>The solid mass located deep in the lower abdomen lacks a consistent position, and when poison enters through the throat to the stomach, then to the intestines, it will eventually reach its destination. If the old illness is not resolved, a new one is bound to arise. In treating this, one should first make pills from ginger, cinnamon, and prepared aconite root, exposing them to dry thoroughly. Then use ginseng and atractylodes to form a thick outer layer, allowing the throat and stomach to recognize ginseng and atractylodes while remaining unaware of the ginger, cinnamon, and aconite. This approach ensures delivery to the site of the mass, where it can start to dissolve, allowing for the solid mass to be reduced and possibly eliminated.</p>
<p>Currently, the supervising official is overwhelmed, and soldiers fill his ranks, where riches fill the bellies of others while lives hang in others&#39; hands, leading to an inability to effectively deal with the enemy. The primary issue lies in using soldiers to protect the supervisors instead of the other way around, which is why there has been no success. If I command my troops to match the enemy from all sides while placing supervisors near enemy lines, building strong defenses and clearing the fields, adopting combined practices of cultivation and warfare with the local populace, then with a solid structure around my troops, we will not be restricted by conditions that hinder our elite forces. My soldiers can advance bravely, either striking their front or rear, breaking through their core, resting by day and charging by night to disrupt their disarray; thereby, the successes will come of their own accord.<a id="trans-352p" href="#orig-352p" class="marker">[352p]</a><br>Moreover, there is supervision to protect against external threats; thus, foreign troops do not dare to break ranks and cause chaos. This prevents the people from becoming bandits, and those bandits can be returned to the status of civilians. What do the barren mountains and valleys know of the current world? Nonetheless, I will briefly mention a point regarding medical practices, should there be anything useful to share. </p>
<p>Someone asked: The concept of external treatment is quite lengthy in principle; why are ancient methods not applied? I respond: There are many instances where ancient methods are indeed employed. For example, using cinnabar for clothing represents the red of the southern region, which is believed to connect to the heart, ensuring that various medicines are protected and reach the heart effectively. Similarly, using indigo for clothing represents the blue of the eastern region, which connects to the liver, thereby ensuring that the medicines are protected and reach the liver.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of severe sores, a medicine is wrapped in onion leaves; one then chews and swallows the onions, aiming to avoid harming the throat and directly targeting the sore. This principle also applies to decoctions. For instance, when preparing a strong decoction with cinnamon, one adds a few grams of fresh berberine after boiling, and then quickly takes it when cool. The cooked parts act to move downward within, while the fresh parts facilitate outward movement, which aligns with the concept of external treatment.</p>
<p>Zhongjing treated cases of cold damage with yin symptoms, preparing a decoction of whole aconite, and added a few drops of fresh pig bile. This demonstrates that the wise and sacred application of medicine always adheres to principles.<a id="trans-353p" href="#orig-353p" class="marker">[353p]</a><br>&quot;The Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; says: I once treated a young man who, due to accidental exposure to filth and poison, suddenly developed a chancre. It began to ulcerate at the glans, and remedies were ineffective. The condition extended from the glans into the urethra, gradually worsening until it reached the anal area, resulting in swollen and painful segments resembling a fishbone. Each night, pus accumulated at the glans, unable to exit. When attempts were made to alleviate this, urine followed after the pus; washing and applying treatments were futile and the situation was extremely dire. </p>
<p>I happened upon an old man in the mountains who passed on a recipe involving the flowers and stamens of the locust tree. I used it for treatment, and within ten days, the root and stem gradually improved. After half a month, the condition resolved from the inside out, returning to the glans until it was completely healed. Following the healing of the chancre, minor ulcers remained, and I administered a decoction of Sichuan pepper for over ten doses until complete recovery.</p>
<p>I then told the old man about the formula: this remedy effectively treats sexually transmitted sores and heat toxins, which are expelled through urination, enabling the treatment of this chancre. However, those who take this can avoid lifelong complications from sores and toxins. </p>
<p>There are indeed miraculous detoxifying effects evident at the time the sores appear; one may see sudden widespread red spots on the body, which fade after a few days, indicating the areas where toxins are about to erupt. Once the toxins are resolved, the shape of the sore may still be visible, which is a sign of this effect. Initially, I did not believe in this; yet at the time the sores emerged in this man, there indeed weren&#39;t many, and the red spots were conspicuously observed over the entire body, dissipating after two days. It was then I started to understand the remarkable nature of these sores.<a id="trans-354p" href="#orig-354p" class="marker">[354p]</a><br>I once treated a strong young man who, due to the fear from a cruel official, showed symptoms resembling bloating and fever, yet they were neither. He abstained from food and was in a weakened state. Many believed it was phlegm-heat, suggesting a need to clear the middle jiao. I diagnosed him, saying this fear had caused internal damage, with the lesser yang energy being obstructed, affecting the heart and kidneys, resulting in significant deficiency. I then intensified warming and tonifying treatments, also addressing the heart and spleen, and after a month, he was able to get up. After recovery, although his physical strength was as strong as before, his yang essence remained dim and did not rise. I warned him, saying: With a foundation like this, the damage to the kidneys is severe, which is not a favorable sign for one so young; you must quickly cultivate the heart and kidneys to avoid further troubles. He, however, dismissed my warning as fear-mongering and did not believe me. Before half a year had passed, he fell ill again and died, demonstrating the considerable harm that fear can cause.<a id="trans-355p" href="#orig-355p" class="marker">[355p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　二阳之病发心脾，有不得隐曲，女子不月，其传为风消。其传为息贲者，死不治。　　【注　二阳者，足阳明胃经也。夫人之精血，由胃腑水谷之所资生，脾主为胃行其精液者也。二阳病则中焦之汁竭，无以奉心神而化赤，则血虚矣。水谷之精，脾不能转输于五脏，则肾无所藏而精虚矣。男子无精，有不得为隐曲之事，在女子无血则月事不得以时下矣。此病本于二阳而发于心脾也。精血两虚，则热盛而生风，风热交炽，则津液愈消竭矣。火热烁金，而传为喘急息肩者，死不治。盖胃乃津液之生原，肺乃津液之化原也。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>】　　三阳为病发寒热，下为痈肿，及为痿厥腨(疒肙)，其传为索泽，其传为颓疝。　　【注　三阳者，太阳之为病也。太阳之气主表，邪之中人，始于皮毛，邪正相搏，发为寒热之病矣。太阳主开，病则开阖不得，邪气从之，逆于肉理，乃生痈肿。太阳为诸阳主气而主筋，筋伤则为痿，气伤则为厥也。此皆太阳筋脉之为病也。太阳之气主表，而经脉发原于下，是以始病寒热之在上在表，而渐为痈肿、痿厥、颓疝之在内在下也。太阳之经气生于膀胱。膀胱者，主藏津液，气化则出。太阳之气病热于表，传入于里，则水津枯索而泽竭矣。颓疝小腹控卵肿痛，所谓膀胱疝也。盖始病标而及本，始病气而及经与筋也。】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　　　　诊要经终论</p>

<p>　　肾风之状，多汗恶风，面痝然浮肿，脊痛不能正立。其色炲，隐曲不利，诊在肌上，其色黑。　　【注　风邪干肾，则水气上升，故面痝然浮肿，风行则水涣也。肾主骨，故脊痛不能正立。肾主藏精，少阴与阳明会于宗筋，风伤肾气，故隐曲不利。水气上升，故黑在肌上，水乘土也。】<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　五脏生成篇</p>

<p>　　肾脉大急沉，肝脉大急沉，皆为疝。心脉搏滑急为心疝。肺脉沉搏为肺疝。三阳急为瘕，三阴急为疝。　　 【注　大则为虚，急则为寒，沉为在下在里，故皆为疝。心疝之有形，在少腹，其气上搏于心，故心脉搏而滑急也。肺脉浮而反沉搏，是肺气逆聚于内而为肺疝矣。瘕，假也，假物而成形。疝字从山，艮止高起之象。故病三阳之气者为瘕，三阴之气者为疝。】<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　　脉解篇</p>

<p>　　前阴者，宗筋之所聚，太阴、阳明之所合也。　　 【注　宗筋根起于胞中，内连于肾脏。阴阳二气，生于胃腑，输于太阴，藏于肾脏。太阴、阳明合聚于宗筋者，中焦之太阴、阳明，与下焦之少阴、太阳，中下相合，而会合于前阴之间。】　　厥阴之厥，则少腹肿痛，腹胀，泾溲不利，好卧屈膝，阴缩肿胻内热。　　 【注　足厥阴之脉，内抵少腹，挟胃属肝络胆，故厥则少腹肿痛而腹胀。其下循阴股，入毛中，环阴器，抵少腹，是以泾溲不利，阴缩而肿。肝主筋，膝者筋之会。筋脉厥逆，不能濡养筋骨，故好卧而屈膝。其脉起于大指丛毛之际，上循足胻，厥阴木火主气，荣俞厥逆，故胻内肿热也。】<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>　　　　　玉机真脏论</p>
<p>　　风者，百病之长也。弗治，脾传之肾，病名曰疝瘕，少腹冤热而痛，出白，一名曰蛊。　　 【注　邪聚下焦，故少腹冤热而痛，溲出淫浊也。蛊，言阴邪居下而坏事之极。】<br>　　　　　骨空论</p>
<p>　　任脉为病，男子内结七疝，女子带下瘕聚。　　 【注　七疝者，其病各异，其名不同。瘕者，假血液而时下汁沫；聚者，气逆滞而为聚积也。冲脉之血气，散于脉外之气分，故病则逆气里急。】　　督脉生病，从少腹上冲心而痛，不得前后，为冲疝。　　 【注　其脉从少腹直上贯心，故冲心而痛。绕于前后二阴之篡间，故不得前后而为冲痛之疝。】<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　　　　四时刺逆从论</p>

<p>　　木肾者，心火下降则肾水不患其不温，真阳下行则肾气不患其不和，既温且和，安有所谓木强者哉？夫惟嗜欲内戕，肾家虚惫，故阴阳不相交，水火不相济，而沉寒痼冷，凝滞其间，胀大作痛，顽痹结硬，势所必至矣。不可纯用燥热，当温散温利，以逐其邪。邪气内消，荣卫流转，如寒谷回春，盖有不疾而速，不行而至者矣。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>　　　　　治法</p>
<p>　　凡治七疝，多用热药而获效者，即《内经》从治之法耳。须用寒凉药监制之，不可纯用大热之剂，如乌头、附子之类，令人久服多服，必变剧不可治矣。但宜以二陈汤加枳实、橘核、栀子、山楂等药，煎入生姜汁，热辣饮之。　　恐有瘀血作痛者，本方加延胡索、桃仁泥。　　如有气作痛者，本方加木香、茴香、楝实等药。　　如六脉沉细，手足厥冷者，本方加附子、干姜、肉桂之类以佐之。　　如睾丸痛甚者，加荔枝核、乳香、没药为细末调入。本方煎药内，或另用顺流水调服亦可。　　如木肾肿大如升斗者，本方去甘草加海藻、昆布、荔枝核、茴香、川楝子等药为末，顺流水调服，作丸子服亦可。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>　　　　　囊痈</p>
<p>　　《外科精要》云：痈疽入囊者死。囊属厥阴，今以死言之，将以为属少阴肾经邪？予亲见入囊者七八人，悉以湿热入肝经施治，而用补阴药佐之，虽脓溃皮脱，睾丸悬挂可畏者，皆不死。但不知下虚年老者如何耳？囊痈，湿热下注也。有作脓者，此浊气润下，将流入渗道，因阴道或亏，水道不利而然。脓尽自安，不药可也。惟在善于调摄耳。又有因腹肿，渐流入囊，肿甚而囊自裂开，睾丸悬挂，水出，以杉木炭末敷外，以紫苏叶包裹，仰卧养之。　　大抵此证属阴道亏，湿热下利所致，故滋阴降湿药不可缺。常治肿痛，小便秘滞者，用除湿为主，滋阴佐之。肿痛已退，便利已和者，除湿滋阴药相兼治之。欲其成脓，用托里为主，滋阴佐之；候脓成即针之，仍用托里滋阴。若湿毒已尽者，专用托里。如脓清或多或敛迟者，用大补之剂，或附子饼灸之。<a id="orig-51p" href="#trans-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>　　　　　阴疮</p>

<p>　　寒疝，宜以温剂下之，禹功散、加味五苓散下青木香丸，或五积、蟠葱之类。水疝宜禹功散、三花神佑丸、导水丸逐水之剂下之。筋疝，以降心火之剂下之，泻心汤主之。血疝，宜玉烛散和血之剂下之。气疝，宜散气药下之，荡疝丸或蟠葱散主之。狐疝，宜以逐气流经之剂下之。(疒贵)疝，宜去湿之剂下之，三花、神佑丸之类。元神虚弱受寒，作小肠疝气滚痛，以蟠葱散加故纸、小茴、川楝子、木香之类。体壮实，小肠气痛，或小便不通，以八正散加破故纸、小茴香、川楝子。<br>　　　　古今医统 【明　徐春甫】<a id="orig-98p" href="#trans-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　阴肿</p>
<p>　　夫阴肿者，皆由膀胱蕴热，风湿相乘；或湿热流注；或疝气攻作；或暴风客热，及小儿啼叫，怒气结聚；或虫蚁吹毒所致。详其所因，施以方治。<br>　　　　　疝</p>
<p>　　疝脉紧急洪数，则为热痛。经言：脾传之肾，病名曰疝瘕。少腹烦冤而痛出白，名曰蛊。注言少腹痛，溲出白液也。一作客热内结，销铄脂肉，如蛊之食，故名曰蛊。然经复言热为疝瘕，则不止为寒，当以脉证辨之。　　《辨疑录》云：每见男子小肠疝气，痛不可忍，阴囊肿大，或偏坠一边，发作之时，小肠扪之，声如青蛙，状如桃、李、木瓜，冲上则面黑，坠下则仆地。病者不胜痛苦，诸医治疗，莫测其机。有云：疝本肝经，与肾经绝无相干。恐为未备之说。原夫疝气，肝经属本，心肾属标。疝者多湿热怒气伤肝，房劳过度，心肾包络郁结，小肠皮里膜外，气聚无出，以致如斯。或曰：以心肾为标，今以房劳过伤，是独言其肾也。<a id="orig-99p" href="#trans-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>譬如小儿偏坠无房劳，斯疾何由而作也？曰：小儿因禀父母湿热，气郁小肠而成偏坠，皆不作疼痛。至于中年房劳过度，戕其真气，包络气虚，肾邪冲上，往来疼痛，故发作无度。今世俗作寒气，或作郁结而治，每用香燥及用大黄、牵牛、巴霜利其大便，元气转伤而病愈甚。予考小肠多气少血之经，心气郁结则腑受邪，肝气一盛则子亦盛矣。故二气攻入小肠、膀胱而痛。病者但以手扪之可忍，殊不知皮膜渐宽，其气愈炽，服药不能避忌，年远根深，故难治救。每用五苓散内加行气之药，获效者多，利小便以出邪者鲜矣。按药性猪苓、泽泻分理阴阳以和心与小肠之气，白朮调脾，并利脐腰间湿及死血，茯苓淡利膀胱之水，桂能伐肝邪，茴香善治小肠之气，金铃子、橘核去膀胱之气，槟榔下气，少加木通以为导引小肠之邪出也。屡用屡验。　　木肾是湿热顽痹，结硬如痰核之类，反不痛是也。治宜温散疏利以逐之。<a id="orig-100p" href="#trans-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>　　　　证治凖绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>

<p>　　或问疝病，古方有以为小肠气者，有以为膀胱气者，惟子和、丹溪专主肝经而言，其说不同，何以辨之？曰：小肠气，小肠之病；膀胱气，膀胱之病；疝气，肝经之病。三者自是不一。昔人以小肠、膀胱气为疝者，悞也。殊不知足厥阴之经，环阴器，抵少腹。人之病此者，其发睾丸胀痛，连及少腹，则疝气之系于肝经可知矣。小肠气，俗谓之横弦、竖弦，绕脐走注，少腹攻刺。<a id="orig-101p" href="#trans-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>而膀胱气则在毛际之上，小腹之分作痛，与疝气之有形如瓜，有声如蛙，或上于腹，或下于囊者不同也。但小肠、膀胱，因经络并于厥阴之经，所以受病连及于肝，则亦下控引睾丸为痛，然止是二经之病，不可以为疝也。　　赵以德曰：此条本为睾丸之证立名。然《内经》以疝者痛也，有腹中脏腑之痛，一以疝而名者，故通叙于此。其腹中五脏之疝，得以就此而考焉。有睾丸之痛，《内经》谓任脉为病，男子内结七疝，女子带下瘕聚。冲脉为病，逆气里急。然称任脉有七疝之名而无七疝之状。<a id="orig-102p" href="#trans-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>及按诸篇，以双字命其名曰(疒颓)疝者，以三阳为病，发寒热，痿厥，其传为(疒颓)疝；及阳明司天，阳明之胜肝是动病，足阳明筋病，皆为(疒贵)疝；谓厥疝者，面黄，脉之至大而虚，有积气在腹中，有厥气，名曰厥疝；谓疝瘕以脾邪传之肾，病名疝瘕，少腹冤热而痛，出白，一名曰蛊；谓冲疝者，以冲任督生病，上冲心痛，不得前后；谓卒疝者，邪客厥阴之络，则卒疝暴痛，与厥阴之别蠡沟，气逆亦睾丸卒痛；谓(疒贵)癃疝者，厥阴之阴盛而脉胀不通；谓狐疝者，肝所生病也。<a id="orig-103p" href="#trans-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>殆非及此双字之名者，由任脉行诸经之会，而有七疝者欤？此外独称一宇疝者，则有太阴在泉，主胜则寒气逆满，甚则为疝；有太阳在泉，少腹控睾上引心痛；有少腹痛不得大小便，名曰疝，得之寒；有足太阴经病，阴器纽痛，上引脐；有心疝脉急，小肠为之使，少腹当有形；有肾脉大急滑皆为疝，心脉搏滑急为心疝，肺脉沉搏为肺疝，三阴急为疝。《灵枢》有谓心脉微滑为心疝。肝脉滑甚为(疒贵)疝。<br>脾脉微大为疝气，腹中裹大脓血在肠胃之外；滑甚为(疒贵)癃疝。肾脉滑甚为癃(疒贵)。诸脉之滑者，为阳气甚盛，微有热。夫如是者，名为七疝，中分邪气之寒热者也。《内经》又云：厥阴滑则病狐疝，少阴脉滑病肺风疝，太阴脉滑病脾风疝，阳明脉滑病心风疝，太阳脉滑病肾风疝，少阳脉滑病肝风疝。所言风者，非外入之风，由肝木阳脏自动之风也。故经云，脉滑曰风。<a id="orig-104p" href="#trans-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>然连以疝称者，盖肾肝同居下焦，而足厥阴佐任脉之生化，因肝肾之气并逆，所以任之阴气为疝，肝之阳气为风，所以风疝连称也。李东垣谓脉滑者，为丙丁火热并于下，不胜壬癸，从寒水之化，故生(疒颓)疝，亦用热治，《内经》亦不专主尺部而言也，岂不为外寒郁内热之故？乃曰热火从寒化，恐理未当。而经更有茎垂者，身中之机，阴阳之候，津液之道也。或饮食不节，喜怒不时，津液内溢，下流于睪，血道不通，日久不休，俯仰不便，趋翔不能，此病荣然有水，不上不下，若此者，亦(疒贵)疝之一也。<a id="orig-105p" href="#trans-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>张仲景言疝皆由寒邪得之，亦同《内经》之云脉紧者，当温散之。或曰：《内经》言疝，似若各从诸经脉所生，今子何为尽属于任脉乎？曰：任脉是疝病之本源，各经是疝病之支流。何以言之？盖肾脏以四方分部者言，则属五行之寒水，以居在下位者言，则属地道之阴。阴形偶，故肾有两，其形两则地道之刚柔立焉。包居两形之间，出纳肾脏之精血，以行坤土之化生，成百骸万象，及夫生长壮老已之天癸，与作强伎巧之用，悉在于斯。<a id="orig-106p" href="#trans-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>然而坤土居尊，不自司其职，司其职者，乃冲、任二脉起于胞中者，行其化也。是故五脏六腑之经，皆受气于六脉，因以海名之。所以，二脉贵乎流通而恶闭塞。流通则天之阳气下降，与之从事，故施化之道行；闭塞则天之阳绝，故地之阴亦结，而百病作矣。故疝是二者所致也。任脉之病者，若刚柔自相胜负，与内外邪之感伤，皆得使其阴阳不和，阴偏胜则寒气冲击，阳偏胜则热气内入，阴反之外，悉致任脉为疝。纵其邪不自任脉而起，初由各经所受而得者，亦必与任脉相犯故也。<a id="orig-107p" href="#trans-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>所犯者何？或所胜之经脉相传，或受不以次所乘，或任脉过处与受邪之经相会，或六经受气之际，挟邪犯其海，则皆足以感动任脉，内含结固不化之阴，上击脏腑则为腹中之疝，下入厥阴会于阴器则为睪丸之疝。盖疝自立名，独为任脉所职，在地之阴，特然起击者而命之也。若诸经受邪，不与任脉相干，则不名为疝矣。不然，何《内经》举痛篇、《灵枢》百病始生篇专为发明经脉腹中诸痛者，乃无一字名其疝也？此可见任脉者，是疝病之本源。诸经所云疝者，是其支流余裔耳。若夫巢氏所叙七疝，曰厥、症、寒、气、盘、附、狼，及言诸疝之候，止以阴气积于内，为寒气所加，使荣卫不调，血气虚弱，故风冷入于腹内而成疝也。小儿(疒贵)者，阴核肿大，由啼哭躽气不止，动于阴气，结聚不散所致者也。观于五疝，皆是痛在心腹之疝，独举(疒贵)疝属小儿病。<a id="orig-108p" href="#trans-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>后人述其说，更举《内经》谓脾风传之于肾名曰蛊。疝瘕少腹烦冤而痛，一名曰蛊者，谓之蛊病。又立阴疝条，即(疒颓)疝也，将以足七疝之数。此言五条为心腹痛者之治疗，则曰：若因七情所伤者，当调气安其五脏；外邪所干者，当温散之。治之不当，内外之气，交入于肾者为肾气，入于膀胱者为膀胱气，入于小肠者为小肠气。肾与膀胱，一脏一腑，其气通于外肾，小肠系于睪丸，系会故也。又谓阴疝一名(疒颓)疝，其种有四，肠、气、卵、水也。至张戴人非之曰：此俗工所立谬名也。盖环阴器，上抵少腹，乃属足厥阴肝经之部分，是受疝之处也。或在泉寒胜，水气挛缩，郁于此经；或司天燥胜，木气抑郁于此经；或忿怒悲哀，忧抑顿挫，结于此经；或药淋外固，闭尾缩精，壅于此经。了不相干膀胱、肾、小肠之事，乃厥阴肝经之职也。凡疝者，非肝木受邪，则肝木自甚也。由是于阴疝中，亦立七疝之名，曰寒、水、筋、血、气、狐、(疒颓)也。<a id="orig-109p" href="#trans-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>夫既曰用《内经》、《灵枢》、《明堂》之论，要穷疝病之源，而不及于任脉生病之源，何也？盖因力辨阴器与小肠、肾、膀胱了不相干，是属足厥阴部分受病之原，立说所以不及于任脉，然已三见于论中矣。其间引治疝之穴，多与任脉所会，一也。又称冲、任、督与厥阴会于曲骨，环阴器，二也。复言凡精滑白淫，皆男子之疝也；血涸不月，月罢腰膝上热，嗌干，少腹有块，女子之疝也；但女子不谓之疝而谓之瘕，即任脉内结之病尤明，三也。<a id="orig-110p" href="#trans-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>凡戴人辨论之词强直，专主其一，则不复顾其二。在(疒颓)疝中有无六经外证之可辨，若果有膀胱、小肠之证者，又安得不从之？如《灵枢》谓小肠病者，小腹痛，腰脊控睪丸而痛之类，论治法亦然。因病在下，必先下之，更不问虚弱之人，于首尾不可下者下之，有不旋踵之祸，岂待下后始补而可回其生乎？然而戴人之书，其词直，其义明，读之使人豁然，以去胸中之茅塞，诚是诸医书之冠。及乎详究之，则少温润反复之意。且夫阴阳变化，生病于无穷，治法亦无穷，非一人所能究。学者当因其已明，益其未至，然后得为善用其书者。<a id="orig-111p" href="#trans-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>丹溪先生尝论睾丸连小腹急痛者，或有形，或无形，或有声，或无声，人皆以为经络得寒，收引不行而作痛。不知此病始于湿热，郁遏至久，又感外寒湿热，被郁而作痛也。其初致湿热之故，盖大劳则火起于心，醉饱则火起于胃，房劳则火起于肾，大怒则火起于肝。火郁之久，湿气便盛，浊液凝聚，并入血隧，流于厥阴。肝属木，性急速，火性又暴烈，为寒所束，宜其痛甚而暴也。此论亦就厥阴受病处，发明戴人之未至者也，诚有功于后学。<a id="orig-112p" href="#trans-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>盖(疒颓)疝不离此三者之邪，热则纵，寒则痛，湿则肿，须分三者多少而治之。两丸俱病，固然也。设有偏于一者，予又不能无其说焉。肾有两，分左右，其左肾属水，水生肝木，木生心火，三部皆司血，统纳左之血者，肝木之职也；其右属火，火生脾土，土生肺金，三部皆司气，统纳右之气者，肺金之职也。是故诸寒收引则血泣，所以寒血从而归肝，下注于左丸；诸气膹郁则湿聚，所以湿气从而归肺，下注于右丸。且夫睾丸所络之筋，非尽由厥阴，而太阴、阳明之筋亦入络也。往往见人偏患于左丸者则痛多肿少，偏于右丸者则痛少肿多，此便可验也。<a id="orig-113p" href="#trans-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>　　　　　悬痈</p>

<p>　　疝，隐疾也，证有七，皆有虚实。今考七方，志七疝耳。若虚实之辨，则在夫人之变通也。　　寒疝腰痛，牵引睾丸，屈而不伸，尺内脉沉迟者，吴茱萸加附子汤主之。夫七疝：寒、水、筋、血、气、狐、(疒颓)也。寒疝之由，是寒客下体，如坐于卑冷，涉于寒渊所致。寒气自外入内，束其少火，郁其肝气，故令腰痛。痛而牵引睾丸者，肝之经络环阴器也。寒主收引，故屈而不伸。尺内主腰以下，脉沉迟，阴脉也，寒亦明矣。故用吴茱萸、附子之辛热以温其寒，生姜、大枣之辛温以和其气。邪伤之后，其正必虚，人参之补以去其虚。　　水疝者，肾囊肿大，阴汗不绝，升阳除湿汤主之。<a id="orig-117p" href="#trans-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>子和云：水疝者，得之饮水醉酒，劳于使内，其言当矣。盖饮水醉酒则湿气胜，劳于使内则肾气虚，肾气虚则湿胜而流坎也，故令肾囊肿大如水晶，阴汗下溉如罅漏。《内经》曰：下者举之。又曰：风能胜湿。是方也，柴胡、羌活、苍朮、防风、升麻、槁本、蔓荆、独活，皆味辛而气清，风药也，升药也，故可以胜湿升阳。而黄芪之甘可使托其陷下之气，甘草之温可使培其防水之土，当归之润可使调荣血于风药之队也。胃苓汤亦可酌用。　　外肾因扑损而伤，睾丸偏大，有时疼痛者，此中有死血，名曰血疝。宜按摩法，详导引中。　　筋疝者，甘草梢黑豆汤主之。夫筋疝者，茎筋挈痛，挺胀不堪也。子和云：此以邪术得之。邪术者，房术春方之类也。治宜解毒缓急，故用甘草梢、黑豆以主之。<a id="orig-118p" href="#trans-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>　　气疝者，拂郁则睪丸肿大，悲哀则不药而消，虎潜丸主之。盖邪之所凑，常乘其虚。拂郁而睾丸肿大者，肝气乘肾之虚也。悲哀不药而消者，气有所泄也。夫肝肾之病同一治，故知、蘗、熟地、芍药、牛膝、当归、琐阳味厚之品，补肾补肝。龟得天地之阴气最厚，虎得天地之阴气最雄，以血气中之阴类以补阴，欲其同气相求耳。陈皮者，取其能推陈腐之气；羊肉者，取其能补五脏之阳也。或问何以不用橘核、枳实、细辛、川楝子、青皮之辈？余曰：此皆破气药也。昔医固多用之，然而治标云尔，况蹈重虚之戒乎？气实者用之可也。　　狐疝者，昼则气出，而肾囊肿大，令人不堪。夜则气入，而肿胀皆消，略无疾苦。<a id="orig-119p" href="#trans-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>补中益气加黄蘗、知母汤主之。病愈而止。夫狐之为物也，昼则出穴而溺，夜则入穴而不溺，以斯证肖之，故曰狐疝。夫昼，阳也；夜，阴也。昼病而夜否者，气病而血不病也。故用人参、黄芪、白朮、甘草以益气。方内有升麻、柴胡，则能举其陷下之阳；方内有黄蘗、知母，则能益夫不足之坎。当归味辛，可以活其壅滞之血；陈皮气芳，可以利其陈腐之气。或问何以不主辛香流气之剂？余曰：本以气不足而致疾，复以流气之剂主之，非惟无益而又害之矣。　　(疒颓)疝者，顽疝也。睪丸虽大而无疾苦也。此以父子相传，得于有生之初已然，非若有生之后三因所致之疾也，故不必主治。或有先是(疒颓)疝，后来疼痛疾苦者，此兼前件六证也，宜于前方消息之。<a id="orig-120p" href="#trans-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>　　　　外科正宗 【明　陈实功】</p>

<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor’s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>At sixty years of age, there is impotence, a significant weakening of qi, the nine orifices are not functioning well, there is deficiency below and fullness above, and both tears and mucus flow out. [Note: At sixty, one has already surpassed seventy or eighty years. The heavenly essence is exhausted, kidney qi significantly weakens, resulting in impotence. The nine orifices depend on the qi of water; when essence is depleted, and vital essence declines, the nine orifices become dysfunctional. With essence exhausted below and fluid overflowing above, both tears and mucus will be present.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When the diseases of the two Yang emerge, they affect the heart and spleen, and there can be no hiding of curves; if a woman does not menstruate, it is transmitted as wind dissipating. When it conveys to difficult breathing, it is incurable. [Note: The two Yang refers to the foot Yangming stomach channel. A woman&#39;s essence and blood are nourished by the water and grains of the stomach, while the spleen governs the movement of essence and liquid from the stomach. When the two Yang are sick, the fluids of the middle burner are exhausted, and there is no means to nourish the heart spirit and transform blood, resulting in blood deficiency. If the spleen cannot transport and transform the essence of grains and water to the five organs, the kidneys have nowhere to store essence, leading to essence deficiency. If a man lacks essence, it cannot fulfill the need of curved concealment; if a woman lacks blood, then menstruation cannot arrive on time. This illness originates from the two Yang and manifests in the heart and spleen. With both essence and blood deficient, there arises a strong heat leading to wind; with the interaction of wind and heat, body fluids become increasingly depleted. The fire burns fiercely, conveying as urgent breathing and shoulder lifting, leading to inevitable death. The stomach is the origin of body fluids, while the lungs are responsible for their transformation.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Three Yang conditions manifest as fever and chills, resulting in carbuncles and swellings, as well as atrophy and weakness (of the limbs). They transmit to form a constricted, dry state and can lead to deficiencies and hernias. </p>
<p>Note: The Three Yang refers to conditions of the Sun Yang. The Qi of the Sun Yang governs the exterior; when evils invade, they begin at the skin. When evils clash with the body&#39;s defenses, this develops into fever and chills. The Sun Yang also opens the body&#39;s pathways; when disease occurs, these pathways cannot open and close properly, resulting in external pathogenic influences causing internal issues like carbuncles and swellings. The Sun Yang governs all Yang energies and is responsible for the tendons; when the tendons are harmed, it leads to atrophy, and when energy is damaged, it results in weakness. All these conditions are related to the diseases of the Yang meridians. The Qi of the Sun Yang primarily affects the exterior and originates from the lower regions, hence the initial symptoms of fever and chills are found on the surface, gradually progressing to internal conditions like carbuncles, atrophy, and hernias. The Qi of the Sun Yang arises in the bladder, which is responsible for storing fluids; when the Qi transforms, fluids are expelled. If the Sun Yang&#39;s Qi becomes diseased with heat on the exterior and penetrates inward, it leads to depletion of fluids and the drying up of fluids. Hernias, characterized by swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, are known as bladder hernias. This shows how the disease begins at the surface and affects the root, starting with Qi and then affecting the meridians and tendons.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the case of cold damage lasting six days, the Jueyin receives it. The Jueyin pulse follows the yin vessels and connects to the liver, hence the feeling of fullness and the contraction of the bladder. By the twelfth day, the Jueyin condition weakens, the bladder expands, the lower abdomen slightly descends, and all vital energy dissipates; the illness is thus nearing its end. [Note: The Jueyin, governed by wood and fire, controls qi, resulting in a feeling of fullness. The pulse follows the yin vessels, leading to bladder contraction.

By the twelfth day, the evil qi gradually diminishes, indicating a resurgence of the righteous qi.] When the illness arises from a dual exposure to cold, if it lasts three days, both the Shaoyang and Jueyin become affected, leading to deafness, bladder contraction, and cold extremities; fluids won’t enter, consciousness fades, and death may occur after six days. [Note: The Shaoyang and Jueyin correspond to exterior and interior, thus deafness appears in Shaoyang while contraction occurs in Jueyin.

The kidneys govern the bones, hence the spine pain prevents upright posture. The kidneys store essence; the Shaoyin and Yangming converge at the governing vessel, and wind injures the kidney qi, leading to hidden bends.

<p>When the yellow pulse is present, it is large and hollow, with accumulated qi in the abdomen, leading to a condition known as &quot;jue shan&quot; (syncope). The same applies to women. When this occurs suddenly, it causes the limbs to sweat in the presence of wind. <em>[Note: Sweating of the limbs in the presence of wind indicates that wind-dampness has intruded on the spleen, resulting in accumulated qi. The pathogenic wind of wood internally dries the spleen&#39;s earth, causing dampness and yin to react, thereby accumulating. If the spleen&#39;s qi cannot irrigate the surroundings, it will reverse and create jue qi. This condition is named &quot;jue shan&quot; due to the upward movement of qi causing pain.]</em> The black pulse&#39;s appearance is strong and large, with accumulated qi in the lower abdomen and the genitals, termed &quot;shen bi&quot; (kidney obstruction), which results from bathing in clear water and then lying down. <em>[Note: The measurement for the kidneys is taken at the wrist; when the black pulse is strong and large, it indicates accumulation in the kidneys, making the pulse substantial and pronounced. Its presence above indicates it is strong but not sinking. The relationship with the lower part involves the lower abdomen and the front genitals. The kidneys, governed by cold water, control qi as well.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essence of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: When diagnosing the heart pulse as urgent, what illness might this indicate? What does the condition resemble? Qi Bo replied: This illness is called heart syncope, and a defined shape should be found in the lower abdomen. The Emperor inquired: How do you conclude this? Qi Bo explained: The heart is considered the &quot;yang organ,&quot; while the small intestine is its assistant; hence it is said that the lower abdomen should reflect a tangible form. <em>[Note: All urgency implies coldness. The heart, being a yang organ, fears cold; hence the pulse is urgent. The heart, as the sovereign organ, does not succumb to pathogenic influences, thus the pulse emerges in the organ while its form is expressed in the bowel.]</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of the Common Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If the cun (寸) pulse is deep and weak, it indicates cold and heat, and can lead to hernias and pain in the lower abdomen. [Note: Cun represents Yang, while deep signifies Yin. A deep and weak cun pulse indicates the deficiency of vital energy and the direct invasion of Yang pathogens into the inner Yin. The interplay of Yin and Yang leads to the classification of cold and heat. The invasion of Yang pathogens into the interior also results in hernias and lower abdominal pain.] If the pulse is rapid, it indicates hernias and lower abdominal pain.<br>[Note: Generally, rapid pulses signify cold, hence affirming the presence of internal hernias.]</p>
<p><strong>Theory of the Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>A rapidly deep pulse in the kidney or liver indicates hernias. A slippery and rapid pulse in the heart indicates a cardiac hernia. A deep and slippery pulse in the lung indicates a pulmonary hernia. Rapid pulses in the three Yang channels signify masses, while rapid pulses in the three Yin channels indicate hernias. [Note: A rapid pulse signifies deficiency, and a deep pulse indicates something located internally, thus alluding to hernias. The physical manifestation of a cardiac hernia is found in the lower abdomen, where the energy surges upwards to the heart, leading to a slippery and rapid heartbeat. A floating yet deep pulse in the lung suggests that lung energy is inversely consolidated within, forming a pulmonary hernia. Masses (瘕) are fictitious formations, created by abnormalities. The character for hernia (疝) resembles a mountain, suggesting a halt at an elevated place. Therefore, conditions influenced by the energy of the three Yang channels indicate masses, while those influenced by the energy of the three Yin channels denote hernias.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p>Wind is the chief of all diseases. If left untreated, it affects the spleen and transmits to the kidneys, causing a condition known as hernia or lump, characterized by pain and heat in the lower abdomen, and leading to a discharge of a whitish fluid, also called &quot;gu.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>On the Hollow Bones</strong></p>
<p>When the Ren meridian is diseased, men suffer from internal accumulations of seven types of hernia, and women face issues of discharge and lump formations. The seven hernias manifest differently and have distinct names. The term &quot;lump&quot; refers to the presence of fluid posing as blood, while &quot;accumulation&quot; signifies a stagnation of qi that leads to a buildup. The blood and qi of the Chong vessel disperse into the external environment, hence the retrograde qi results in urgency within. </p>
<p>Diseases originating from the Governor vessel arise when they surge from the lower abdomen up to the heart, resulting in pain that cannot be relieved at the front or back, known as counterflow hernia. The vessel travels straight up from the lower abdomen, thus causing heart pain, and it entangles around the front and back in the space of the two lower yin organs, preventing relief from the pain and forming a counterflow hernia.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>When Yan Yin (the cold) is excessive, it causes diseases related to the liver and hernias of the fox. When Shao Yin is excessive, it causes diseases related to the lungs and hernias. When Tai Yin is excessive, it causes diseases related to the spleen and hernias. When Yang Ming is excessive, it causes diseases related to the heart and hernias. When Tai Yang is excessive, it causes diseases related to the kidneys and hernias. When Shao Yang is excessive, it causes diseases related to the liver and hernias.<br><strong>[Note: The term &quot;excessive&quot; refers to a condition of abundant Yang Qi with some heat-related illness. An abundance of hernia Qi leading to heat results in hernia pain. The term &quot;wind&quot; refers to conditions produced by this heat.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Discussion on the Essentials of Ultimate Truth</strong></p>
<p>When Tai Yang is in the Spring, cold dampness prevails, resulting in people suffering from pain in the lower abdomen and testicles, drawing pain in the back and spine, leading to heart pain, with blood causing throat pain and swelling in the jaws.<br><strong>[Note: In the Year of the Ox, when Tai Yang is in the Spring and cold dampness is present, the bladder and kidneys are affected. The bladder is located in the lower abdomen, causing pain there. The kidneys govern the lower organs, hence the pulling sensation in the testicles. The Tai Yang vessels connect the spine to the lower back and heart, causing back and spine pain. The kidney vessels are linked to the heart, resulting in heart pain as cold pressures the blood, leading to throat pain and jaw swelling, reflecting a small intestine channel issue. The small intestine serves as the &quot;fu&quot; (viscera) for the heart, also indicating that water pathogenic factors are overpowering the heart&#39;s fire.)</strong> Tai Yang&#39;s recovery leads to lower abdominal pain and testicle pulling, which affects the lower back and results in heart pain.<br><strong>[Note: This is also indicative of a condition from Yan Yin.]</strong><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>The moon governs the sky; dampness descends while kidney energy rises. When the chest is not in harmony, there occurs impotence, with energy greatly diminished and unresponsive.<br>(Note: The disharmony in the chest refers to the upward counterflow of water and energy. Impotence arises when kidney energy is weak below. Yang energy is produced from the kidney&#39;s yin and operates on the skin&#39;s surface. Therefore, with greatly weakened kidney energy, the reproductive organs become unresponsive.)</p>

<p>The liver channel shows a slight swelling indicating liver obstruction, leading to retraction of yin; if it is excessive, it results in a hernia.<br>(Note: Swelling indicates excess liver energy. The retraction and hernia imply stagnation of liver energy below.) The heart channel shows a slight sliding quality, indicative of heart hernia involving the navel, causing rumbling in the lower abdomen. </p>
<p>The spleen channel shows slight swelling indicating hernia energy; if it is excessive, it leads to urinary retention, with severe cases involving internal hernia, resulting in the discharge of pus and blood.<br>(Note: The spleen is the damp and earthy element. Excess damp-heat leads to hernia. If deficient and cold, it causes internal issues. The spleen has abundant blood but deficient energy, leading to discharge of pus and blood.) The kidney channel, if overly sliding, indicates urinary retention; if excessively large, it signifies impotence.<br>(Note: Heat in the kidney leads to swelling of the testicles.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Channel Theory</h3>
<p>The Liver channel of the Foot Jueyin, when it is in motion, leads to low back pain making it difficult to bend or stretch, causes hernias in men, and swelling in the lower abdomen of women; it is primarily responsible for diseases arising from the liver, such as fox hernia. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The difficulty in bending or stretching due to low back pain arises because the Jueyin is transformed from the energy of the Shaoyang, indicating a disease of the Jueyin&#39;s Qi. The hernias and swelling in the lower abdomen are all related to the fundamental energy of the Jueyin.]</strong></p>
<p>When the energy of the Foot Jueyin is exhausted, the tendons are severed. The Jueyin corresponds to the Liver channel. The Liver is the convergence of tendons. The tendons are concentrated in the genitals and interlinked at the root of the tongue. Thus, if the pulse does not thrive, the tendons become tense; if the tendons are tense, they pull on the tongue and the eggs. Therefore, if the lips are blue and the tongue is curled while the eggs shrink, it indicates that the tendons are the first to deteriorate. When Geng and Du are deceased, metal overcomes wood. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The energy of the Foot Jueyin governs the tendons; thus, when the energy is exhausted, the tendons are severed. The Jueyin corresponds to the Liver channel, which is the convergence of the tendons, meaning that the Qi of the Jueyin combines with the Liver channel, and the Qi of the liver integrates with the tendons. Concentrated in the genitals indicates the meeting of the pulse energy at the main tendons. If the pulse does not thrive in the tendons, they become tense, resulting in a curled tongue and shrunken eggs. When the Jueyin energy is exhausted, thus the tendons deteriorate first. When Geng and Du are deceased, metal overcomes wood, leading to the exhaustion of the liver&#39;s wood Qi.]</strong><a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Posture of the Jing-Jin</h3>
<p>The ailments of the hand&#39;s Shaoyin Jing-Jin manifest differently with cold and heat. In cold, the tendons retract and are tight; in heat, the tendons relax and do not contract, which leads to impotence. When yang is urgent, the tendons retract; when yin is urgent, they cannot extend. The treatment involves needling to counteract the urgent cold. In heat, the tendons do not retract; thus, there is no need for cauterization, referred to as the &quot;winter obstruction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ailments of the hand&#39;s Shaoyin relate to qi and manifest as Jing-Jin diseases. Cold causes retraction and tightness; heat causes relaxation. When yang is urgent, there is retraction; when yin is urgent, it cannot extend. The essence of Shaoyin is yin, thus marked by yang; hence, there are symptoms of cold, heat, yin, and yang. Shaoyin governs qi and is hence tied to the winter obstruction.</p>
<p>The Jing of the foot’s Jueyin begins above the big toe, follows the inner thigh, and connects to the genitalia, interlacing with various tendons. Its ailment is manifested as impotence. When harmed internally, it does not function; with cold injury, it retracts; with heat, it extends without contraction. The treatment lies in regulating water to clear the yin qi.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The genitalia are the focal point of the tendons, thus connecting with the three yin and three yang tendons. The ailment causes impotence. Internal harm results in impotence; cold injury leads to retraction; heat results in extension without contraction. The Jueyin is seen through the fire transformation of Shaoyang, hence the distinction between cold and heat. Therefore, treat under the influence of metal qi with water qi. Further treatment involves the wood qi. The wood qi of Jueyin originates from water, hence treatment focuses on water to clear the Jueyin qi.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>Generally, in cases of severe cold damage, the transmission of disease occurs first in the yang organs, and then sequentially moves into the yin organs. Since yang governs life, the Taiyang water transmits to the Foot Yangming earth, which then transmits to the Foot Shaoyang wood as a slight pathogenic factor. Yin governs death, so wood transmits to the Foot Taiyin earth, which then transmits to the Foot Shaoyin water, and water transmits to the Foot Jueyin wood. By the sixth or seventh day, if it has transmitted to the Jueyin Liver wood, it must transfer qi to invade the Spleen earth. If the Spleen is repeatedly subjected to the invading evil, then all five organs and six viscera will be burdened and perilous. </p>
<p>When the Ying and wei (nutritive and defensive) energies are obstructed, the ears may become deaf and the abdomen may contract, resulting in being unaware and leading to death. Prompt use of Chengqi Decoction can secure the possibility of saving one out of five lives. The ancients said: &quot;In cases of Spleen heat disease, the five organs become precarious.&quot; They also said: &quot;When earth fails and wood invades, it results in death.&quot; If by the sixth or seventh day it transmits to Jueyin and the pulse is slightly weak and slightly floating, this indicates the Spleen and Stomach pulse is intact, knowing that the Spleen qi is complete and no longer accepts the guest, the evil has no place to reside; the extreme will turn into the favorable, the Ying and wei will recover, water will rise and fire will descend, leading to the occurrence of cold and heat, and a great sweat will resolve the condition.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Seven Hernias</strong>  </p>
<p>Chao Shi says: A hernia is painful and is caused by weakness of the vital and protective energies. An imbalance in diet, whether too cold or too warm, leads to the invasion of cold and evil qi, which enter the abdomen and result in various hernias. When it occurs, there is pain in the lower abdomen, which may circle around the navel or rise to the heart, causing heart and back pain. In severe cases, there may be cold limbs, spontaneous sweating, nausea, and difficulty in bowel movements. Generally, the pulse associated with hernias is taut and tight, indicative of cold and pain. There are seven types of hernias: knot hernia, symptom hernia, cold hernia, qi hernia, disk hernia, attaching hernia, and wolf hernia. How do we define them? Knot hernia presents as heart pain with cold feet and vomiting after eating; symptom hernia is characterized by sudden fullness in the abdomen with gas accumulation like an arm; cold hernia occurs due to cold food and drink, resulting in sudden pain in the abdomen; qi hernia features intermittent fullness and pain in the abdomen; disk hernia causes pain in the abdomen that radiates to the sides of the navel; attaching hernia has pain in the abdomen linked to below the navel with accumulation; wolf hernia causes pain in the lower abdomen connected to the genital area. If hernias do not heal, evil qi remains trapped, leading to accumulation. As for this disease, whether on the left or right side, there may be a sensation like a cup covering the area, or fullness above and below the navel like an arm, or abdominal distension resembling a plate, resulting in emaciation and shortness of breath, chills, alternating cold and heat, a preference for lying down, and ineffective food intake or abdominal fullness with vomiting and diarrhea, with pain triggered by cold. The pulse is constricted and tight, floating and firm, indicative of accumulation. However, a strong and urgent pulse indicates life, while a weak and urgent pulse is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms of Yin (Tui) can be classified into four types: the first is intestinal (Tui), the second is Qi (Tui), the third is swelling of the eggs, and the fourth is water (Tui). The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states: the kidney Qi is deficient, invaded by wind and cold, flowing into the kidneys, unable to disperse, leading to this condition. The &quot;Sanyin&quot; indicates that Yin (Tui) is associated with the liver and connects with the tendons, while the stomach&#39;s Yangming nourishes it. In reviewing numerous texts, they all affirm this view. Many cases arise from poor personal hygiene, excessive sexual activity, prolonged accumulation of emotions such as worry, fear, and anger, sitting or lying in cold and damp places, or overexertion without moderation; all these can lead to this condition. When ill, symptoms include swelling of the egg and cysts, which may vary in size, may be hard as stone, or cause twisting pain in the abdomen; in severe cases, there may be skin abscesses or swelling, leading to sores and toxic conditions. If mild, clear fluid may appear intermittently; in severe cases, there may be festering and decay. Generally speaking, swelling of the eggs and intestinal (Tui) conditions are difficult to treat, while Qi (Tui) and water (Tui) are easier to heal with moxibustion. Additionally, there are cases where children have had this condition since birth, which indicates a chronic illness. The treatment method for the fourth type involves the use of Juzi kernel pills, which have proven effective repeatedly.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Toxic Scrotum (i.e., External Kidney Abscess)</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from the stagnation of damp-heat in the liver channel, which then flows toxins into the bladder and kidney channels. Exposure to cold and heat pathogens, particularly affecting the yin meridians, leads to the coagulation of blood and qi. Cold and dampness do not disperse, resulting in swelling and pain of the scrotum, or even ulceration and skin peeling, with the testicles hanging low. It is advisable to use a cooling liver disharmonization soup for internal consumption and apply Tie Gu San externally. If there is decay, urgently apply Wu Jin San. If ulceration occurs, with reduced appetite and thoughts of food, afternoon fevers may arise; quickly take an enhanced version of Xiao Chai Hu Tang. For severe pain, add Huang Lian; for difficulty in urination, add Mu Tong and Che Qian Zi; for thirst, add Tian Hua Fen, Mai Men Dong, and Wu Wei Zi.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Erosion Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of yin erosion ulcers is due to internal organ weakness, diminished kidney qi, and the invasion of wind pathogens affecting the bowels. These toxins harm the defensive and nourishing aspects, or result from unclean contact with toxic women. Symptoms include intermittent pain and itching, gradually resulting in the formation of sores that discharge pus. If not treated promptly, life may be endangered. First, use She Chuang Zi, Di Gu Pi, and Sang Huai branches to make a warming wash. Internally, consume a clearing heat and detoxifying soup, and use medicinal powders externally. Initially apply Jin Si Gao, followed by Zi Jin Gao to draw out the toxic fluid and promote flesh regrowth. Yin erosion ulcers are indeed the same as lower sores. They may emit a foul odor, which is why the base of the shaft develops sores. These are associated with the liver channel’s territories. For both internal and external erosion sores, with body heat and slow urination, it is advisable to take Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Long Dan Cao, Huang Lian, and Che Qian Zi.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Hedong Six Writings by Liu Wansuo (Jin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Nèituó) Hernia</strong></p>
<p>(Nèituó) hernia refers to the condition of the lower abdomen where there is swelling and acute cramping pain. Cold causes contraction, and when cold reaches its extreme, it transforms into a condition that can be treated with earth, hence causing swelling. The texts say that in men, (nèituó) hernia manifests as acute pain in the lower abdomen associated with the genitals. In women, swelling in the lower abdomen is due to diseases of the liver channel. The classic commentary states that hernia is caused by the accumulation of cold. Additionally, according to the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; all five organs can have hernias, but these are characterized by a rapid pulse. It is noted that a rapid pulse indicates a sign of cold. However, cold should lead to a short, small, and slow pulse; thus, the term &quot;rapid&quot; here does not mean fast and numerous but rather indicates fullness. A tense pulse indicates severe pain, and although cold may be present, it is characterized by a short and small pulse. Therefore, in cases of pain with a tense and rapid pulse, the pulse reflects nourishment from the heart. Whenever there are six qi (elements) involved in the pain, the heart and spirit are unsettled, and the tension cannot relax, leading to observable pulse changes. To understand which qi causes the pain, one must consider the pulse that combines tightness and rapidity. If the pulse is tight and rapid, it indicates heat-related pain. The classic also states that the spleen transmits to the kidneys, with the condition referred to as hernia and masses, characterized by discomfort and pain in the lower abdomen, producing white fluid, hence the name &quot;gu.&quot; The commentary notes that pain in the lower abdomen can lead to white fluid excretion. One interpretation states that internal heat can become constipated, causing the loss of fat like a worm consuming it, hence the name &quot;gu.&quot; However, since the texts repeatedly identify heat as a potential cause of hernia and masses, it should not be assumed to be solely due to cold; differentiation must be made based on pulse and symptoms.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Yin Hernia</h3>
<p>The pulse of the Foot Jueyin circulates around the reproductive organs and reaches the lower abdomen.

<h4>Pain in the Stalk</h4>
<p>For pain in the stalk, it is advisable first to use clearing and cold remedies to dispel it, and then to apply mild and sweet remedies to differentiate it.</p>
<h4>On Hernias, Which Are Fundamental to the Liver Meridian</h4>
<p>There are seven types of hernia; many have discussed them, but I do not accept the views that are not from the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; &quot;Suwen,&quot; or &quot;Copper Man.&quot; It is not that I favor unusual opinions, but I simply wish to uncover the source. What are the seven hernias? They are cold hernia, water hernia, tendon hernia, blood hernia, air hernia, fox hernia, and (sick exhaustion) hernia, which are known as the seven hernias. Common practitioners do not recognize these, thus they create erroneous names. Some say it is the bladder, others say it is cold in the kidneys, or that it is gas in the small intestine; children call it irregular gas. Such misnamed conditions lead to losing the essence of the issue. Why is this? It is because physicians mistakenly classify it as bladder, kidney, or small intestine gas, and also claim it is caused by deficiency and cold. The remedies used are often either deer antler or Ba Jiao, or they switch to Du Zhong and Cong Rong; instead of Fu Zi or Wu Tou, they may use dried ginger or cinnamon; and instead of Huang Lian or Ling Xiang, they might opt for Jin Ling or Bu Gu Zhi. Morning and evening they take these with no significant effect. Over three to twenty years, it remains firmly entrenched. Occasionally, when minor illness occurs, it may seem to alleviate slightly. Holding onto this slight improvement leads to a major misconception. If the marked issue is not resolved, it will inevitably return with greater severity. Tales of this spread everywhere, with no one aware of the truth. Little do they know that all hernias are related to the liver meridian, whose flow ultimately leads to the small intestine and its pouch. The bladder, being a water organ, is responsible for drainage; the small intestine, as a water channel, governs flow; and the kidneys, being associated with the lesser yin, oversee both types of water.<br><a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The small urine of a person enters the small intestine from the stomach and seeps into the bladder. The bladder is a sac for liquid; when it transforms, water exits from the tip, which is the common principle. When it forms a hernia, it belongs to the liver channel of the foot (Jueyin). This channel circles around the genital area and enters the lower abdomen. Both the liver and kidneys are associated with the lower parts, connecting with the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels. Yet, the &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that diseases of the liver channel of the foot can lead to incontinence, urinary obstruction, and hernia. It specifically governs the kidney, bladder, and small intestine channels, thus not mentioning hernia, indicating that the site of hernia is part of the liver. Furthermore, the &quot;Neijing&quot; states that in men, the zong muscle is the meeting of the bones. The liver primarily governs muscles. The testicle is the orb within the sac. Although it primarily governs the external kidney, if not guided by the Jueyin channel, the jade stem cannot expand or contract. In women, it is the genital opening, with inner and outer parts: one is called the ting hole and the other is the yao leak. These are where the foot Jueyin meets the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that the channel of the foot Jueyin converges at the genital area. If it is injured by cold, it retracts; if injured by heat, it protrudes without control. The treatment lies in promoting water to clear the yin Qi. Therefore, the channels of Yangming, Taiyin, and Jueyin all converge at the genital area. Only the Jueyin governs the muscles, thus if a hernia occurs, it must originate from the Jueyin.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The “Lingshu” also states: The differentiation of the foot Jueyin is called Li Gou, located five cun above the inner ankle. It branches off to travel to Shaoyang, following the leg up to the testicles, and connects at the root. When pathogenic qi reverses, it causes testicular swelling and sudden hernias; if it is full, it is elongated, and if it is deficient, it causes severe itching—this is the place where it branches off. Is it not true that Jueyin is the location affected by illness?</p>
<p>The “Lingshu” further states: When the evil is in the small intestine, it is connected to the testicular system, belongs to the kidney, and penetrates through the liver&#39;s network to the lung. The heart is linked to abundant qi, which rises and clashes upward; the intestines and stomach disturb the liver, scattered in the diaphragm and settled at the navel. Therefore, we approach the diaphragm to disperse it, address the Taiyin to pacify it, utilize areas below Jueyin, and apply pressure on Ju Xu and Xia Lian to eliminate it, adjusting according to the meridians it passes through.</p>
<p>Though it initially states the evil is in the small intestine, in the treatment method, it must mention focusing on areas below Jueyin, thus knowing that all hernias relate to Jueyin, inevitably. Consulting the pulse, the “Suwen” mentions that Jueyin slippery indicates fox wind hernias, Shaoyang slippery indicates lung wind hernias, Taiyin slippery indicates spleen wind hernias, Yangming slippery indicates heart wind hernias, Taiyang slippery indicates kidney wind hernias, and Shaoyin slippery indicates liver wind hernias. All six hernias, even if seen in other pulses, are said to be wind hernias of the foot Jueyin liver meridian.</p>
<p>The “Lingshu” also states that a slightly slippery heart pulse indicates heart hernia, a very slippery liver pulse signifies (zang gui) hernia, and a very slippery kidney pulse indicates (zang gui). All these three organ hernias are also characterized by slippage as a sign of hernia.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; also states that a large, rapid pulse indicates hernia. A slippery heart pulse is indicative of heart hernia. A deep lung pulse suggests lung hernia. Rapid pulses in the three Yin indicate hernia, while rapid pulses in the three Yang indicate masses (jias). Wang Taifu said, when the Taiyang experiences cold, blood congeals to form a mass; when the Taiyin experiences cold, qi gathers to form a hernia. It is said that when the Taiyin is affected by cold, it transmits to the liver channel, which can be treated with warming herbs to expel it, but not with nourishing herbs. If one dares to nourish it, it is akin to wanting the illness to leave yet forcefully keeping it. Upon examining &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; it becomes clear that the three Yang diseases manifest as cold and heat, leading to hernia. This indicates that the bladder is not the site of the disease but rather transmits to the Jueyin area, resulting in hernia. Furthermore, it states that if the disease is located in the lower abdomen, causing abdominal pain and inability to urinate or defecate, it is termed hernia, resulting from cold. When the pulse is rapid, it indicates hernia and mass, along with pain in the lower abdomen. When referring to the lower abdomen, is it not the Jueyin region? It is also stated that spleen wind transmits to the stomach, referred to as hernia or mass, suggesting that the liver wood cannot generate wind qi. This is termed Jue hernia, as the spleen earth is deficient and cannot control water, being further weakened by the liver wood. It is also mentioned that the governing vessel corresponds to the chong hernia, as Jueyin intersects with the chong, ren, and governing vessels in the front yin. Is this not clear? As for the movements of qi, it is mentioned that during the year when the Taiyang descends into the springs, cold prevails, causing the people to suffer from pain in the lower abdomen and groin. This occurs because cold invades the small intestine and bladder, causing the liver wood to shrink and become unable to extend; this is the mother transmitting to the child.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yangming governs the heavens; dryness overcomes the excessive moisture, causing men to suffer from testicular hernias and women from lower abdominal pain. This indicates that liver qi cannot ascend and is suppressed by metal, hence the affliction. Additionally, when the Taiyin is at the spring and the earth prevails, cold qi reverses and fills, leading to inability to digest food and drink, which can severely result in hernias. This reflects the cold invading the Taiyin&#39;s damp earth, causing the earth to be unable to overcome water, which impacts the liver meridian. </p>
<p>I have also extensively reviewed the &quot;Copper Man&quot; and the associated points, which reflect outward and inward relations. For example, at the back, the thirteen Shu points indicate cold hernia affecting the liver meridian. In the abdominal region, the Yin Jiao point is noted for cold hernia, being an expression of the Ren meridian; the Guan Yuan point indicates sudden hernia, associated with the small intestine&#39;s reserve and the convergence of the three Yin meridians; the Zhong Ji point refers to hernia and masses, being the reserve of the bladder and also the convergence of the three Yin meridians; and the Qu Gu point relates to hernia and is associated with both the Ren meridian and the Foot Jueyin. </p>
<p>In the second abdominal segment, the Huang Shu points denote cold hernia, being the convergence of the Chong and Foot Shaoyin; the Si Man points reflect hernia and masses, relating to the Chong and Ren meridians and the Foot Shaoyin kidney. In the third abdominal segment, the Da Ju points refer to hernia, arising from the energy of the Foot Yangming meridian; the Qi Chong points indicate testicular hernia, with pain in the scrotum and cold pain in the two testicles, also arising from the energy of the Foot Yangming meridian.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the fourth row of the abdomen, the two points of the palace mention hernia pain, where the foot Taiyin, Jueyin, and Yinwei converge; the two points of Chongmen mention the Yin hernia, where the foot Taiyin and Jueyin meet. For those on the side of the ribs, the two points of Wushu mention cold hernia, where Yin evil rises into the lower abdomen, three inches below the Dai vessel. In the six channels of the foot, the ten points of the foot Jueyin mention hernia seven times, namely Dadu, Xingjian, Taichong, Zhongfeng, Ligou, Zhongdu, and Qusuan. The fourteen points of the foot Shaoyang mention hernia once, specifically Qiusu point. The eleven points of the foot Taiyin mention hernia once, namely Yinlingquan. The fifteen points of the foot Yangming mention hernia once, specifically Yinshi point. The ten points of the foot Shaoyin mention hernia five times, namely Rangu, Taixi, Zhaohai, Jiaoxin, and Zhubin. The eighteen points of the foot Taiyang mention hernia twice, specifically Jindmen and Heyang. Thus, it can be said that only Jueyin mentions hernia frequently, being the main point for hernia. Other meridian points, although they also treat hernia, are ultimately not the locations that receive hernia, but are merely connected to the foot Jueyin. This may be due to cold stagnation in the Qi, wood energy being constricted in this meridian; or due to dryness in the skies, where wood energy is depressed in this meridian; or due to anger, sorrow, and anxiety causing blockages in this meridian; or due to medication externally solidifying, closing the tail and retracting essence, obstructing in this meridian.

If one trusts common remedies, then the &quot;Suwen,&quot; &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; and &quot;Bronze Man&quot; are not valid; if one trusts the &quot;Suwen,&quot; &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; and &quot;Bronze Man,&quot; then common remedies are not valid either. Alas! I have been in the medical field for over forty years, and through long practice have come to recognize illnesses, thus I am no longer confused. Furthermore, conditions such as dysuria, urinary retention, impotence, and excessive sexual desire are all male ailments—not merely due to cold in the kidneys. If there is blood deficiency and the menstrual cycle does not occur, leading to heat in the lower back and knees, foot cramps, throat dryness, urinary retention, abdominal masses that may be fixed or mobile, protrusion of the front or hemorrhoids at the back, these are all female ailments. Yet, women do not call these conditions hernias; they refer to them as masses. If a young person suffers from these, it matters not whether they are male or female, for they will be without offspring. Such hidden and intricate matters have nothing to do with the bladder, kidneys, or intestines; they are the responsibility of the Liver Channel of the Jueyin. Common remedies only speak of the bladder, kidneys, and intestines, completely neglecting the aspect of Liver Wood, which is profoundly misleading. Moreover, the Liver Channel corresponds to the Wood element, which belongs to the East and is the mother of Heart Fire. In general, hernias arise when Liver Wood is invaded by pathogens, or when the Liver Wood itself becomes excessive; one must not hastily claim deficiency and simply supplement. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that the East is solid, the West is void; one purges the South and supplements the North. This refers to purging fire, balancing Wood, clarifying Metal, and strengthening Water.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the past, when Shen Yan was an army officer in Cai, he sat in a damp place and suffered unbearable testicular pain, for which no medicine could provide relief. I hastily administered over thirty doses of water-guiding pills and Yu Gong powder, which quickly alleviated the swelling and reduced the pain. </p>
<p>There was also a man with acute testicular pain who collapsed in the street, and no one could help him. He called for my assistance. I referred to the texts and identified the evil qi residing in the meridian of the foot&#39;s jueyin, which causes sudden testicular pain; hence, I used Yin Wan for the pain. I quickly drained the two acupoints of Dadu, and the severe pain immediately ceased. The Dadu acupoint is indeed one of the two points of the foot&#39;s jueyin.</p>
<p>There was a man in Diao Kou who suffered from a fever with thirst, and his craving for honeyed drinks resulted in extreme injury from ice water. The physicians were unaware that they needed to drain the excess moisture and instead compounded with ginger, causing dampness to be trapped and turning into heat, leading to blockages in the three burners, impaired water pathways, and sluggishness in the reproductive channels, resulting in a swollen scrotum, larger than a ladle. I first administered over a hundred water-guiding pills, and soon after, I used pig kidney powder. That night, he expelled a bucket of dark and light-colored water, and thus the pain at that site was relieved.</p>
<p>Another man had acute testicular pain with pronounced swelling that persisted for several days; all medications acted as if they were thrown into water without effect. I gave him one hundred fifty water-guiding pills for three doses and followed with three qian of Tongjing powder mixed with light wine on an empty stomach. By dawn, he expelled numerous clotted substances from his internal organs, and all pain and swelling disappeared, returning to normal within three days. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: when the wood is congested, it should be expelled to allow for smooth flow, referring to the requirement to vomit for unblocking. Since the liver accumulates, it should ideally be purged; however, one must consider the nature of the ailment both above and below, with alignment to natural flow being paramount. This aligns with Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s assertion that it is appropriate to induce vomiting for conditions above and purging for those below.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Forms of Hernia Disease</strong></p>
<p>Cold hernia: If it persists without offspring, the bag feels cold, hard like stone; the penis does not erect, and may cause pain when pressing on the testicles. This occurs from sitting or lying on damp ground, wading through cold water during the cold months, being exposed to rain or snow, sitting or lying on bricks or stones, or in cold windy places, causing excessive internal labor. It is advisable to use warming agents to treat it.</p>
<p>Water hernia: It presents as kidney cyst pain, with occasional sweat from the genitals, or the cyst appears crystal-like, or itchy and discharges yellow fluid, or causes a water sound when pressed on the lower abdomen. This arises from excessive drinking after intoxication, internal strain, sweating and exposure to wind, or cold dampness gathering in the cyst, leading to an overload of water resulting in sudden hernia. It is advised to use diuretic agents for treatment. Few know the method to expel water through a leaking needle.</p>
<p>Muscle hernia: Symptoms include swelling of the penis, which may ulcerate or form pus, along with pain that causes deep muscle contractions, or internal pain that is extremely itchy, or persistent and elongated without retraction, with a discharge resembling semen, flowing with urine. This condition arises from sexual exhaustion or external malevolent practices. It is advisable to use soothing agents to treat the heart.</p>
<p>Blood hernia: It feels like a cucumber on both sides of the lower abdomen, roughly at the midpoint of the hip bones, commonly referred to as &quot;benyong.&quot; This occurs due to heavy sensations in spring and summer heat, physical labor causing internal strain, where qi and blood overflow, seeping into the pouch and remaining, forming abscesses, often with pus scarce and blood abundant. It is recommended to use tonifying agents for blood to treat it.</p>
<p>Qi hernia: It presents with connections to the kidney area above and the scrotum below, possibly triggered by crying or anger, causing qi stagnation and swelling; when anger and crying cease, the qi disperses.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Shan (a type of hernia) presents as a swelling in the scrotum, similar to a rising or falling form; it is neither itchy nor painful. This condition arises from dampness of the earth, hence it frequently occurs in the Jianghuai region, particularly in low, damp areas. It is advisable to treat it with medicines that dispel dampness. In women, a protrusion at the vulva is also similar, but if associated with heat, it cannot be treated by simply reinforcing or drying it. Its proper name is jia, which should be treated with bitter substances to purge and solidify. Wang Bing states: the downward movement of yang energy leads to the upward contention of yin energy; when there is contention above, there is an excess of cold, and when there is descent below, the tendons become lax. Thus, the hanging of the testicles leads to the occurrence of shan. After addressing the condition of the seven types of shan, treatment can be adjusted or supplemented as needed, based on the severity of the illness, without being strictly bound to conventional methods.

<p>The classic states: When the two Yang conditions manifest in the heart and spleen, there is hindered obstruction, and women do not menstruate. Those who interpret this say, for men, the spleen is affected and nourishment does not transform, thus leading to deficiency; for women, the heart is affected and blood does not flow, hence the absence of menstruation. They separate the heart and spleen for men and women, each subject to this interpretation. However, I beg to differ. The two Yang refer to Yangming, connected to the stomach and large intestine. When the intestines and stomach are ill, the heart and spleen are also affected. To say they reach the heart and spleen is merely to express the extent of their influence. Nonetheless, the spleen and stomach are related; thus, a stomach ailment affecting the spleen is justifiable. However, the large intestine and heart are not connected; why do disturbances from the large intestine reach the heart? This is because the stomach is the repository of intake, and the large intestine is responsible for transformation and transportation.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Food ingested into the stomach returns impure energy to the heart, while drink ingested into the stomach is transformed into essence by the spleen; this is due to the stomach&#39;s ability to receive and the large intestine&#39;s ability to transform. When the intestines and stomach are ill, they cannot receive or transform, so what can the heart and spleen rely on? If the heart and spleen have no resources, then there can be no transformation and the generation of essence and blood will cease. Thus, when the intestines and stomach are ill, the heart and spleen suffer, leading to men producing less essence and women not having their menstruation. The heart and spleen should be discussed in general terms for both men and women, and should not be treated differently except in specific conditions like hidden blockages or missed menstruation. If one were to follow the words of the Buddhist, it would imply that a man&#39;s essence relies solely on the spleen and not on the heart, and that a woman&#39;s blood relies solely on the heart and not on the spleen. Is there such reasoning? Indeed, the essence and blood of both men and women are nourished by the interaction of the five organs before they are formed. Can it be said that a man&#39;s essence relies on the spleen and a woman&#39;s blood on the heart? The classics state: both men and women can suffer from heart and spleen ailments. However, in men, this manifests as hidden blockages that are detrimental, while in women, it results in missed menstruation.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The front yin is affected by extreme cold and heat, leading to the descent and shrinkage of the pouch. The theories of Yin and Yang state that when the three Yangs manifest a disease, it brings cold and heat, resulting in obstructed swelling, or causing paralysis of the intestines (hernia). This condition can manifest as a thickening of the pouch and is commonly referred to as hernia. When heat is external and cold is internal, the pouch descends; this corresponds to the energy of late summer. Conversely, when cold is external and heat is internal, the egg contracts; this corresponds to the energy of mid-winter. </p>
<p>The meridian of the foot&#39;s Taiyang bladder ascends, meets the hand&#39;s Taiyang and small intestine meridians, and descends to the foot&#39;s Jueyin liver meridian, where it is unable to extend. If both the Ren and Jueyin meridians are in rebellion, it is like a mighty river, causing Yang energy to fall. This situation results from wind, cold, dampness, and heat escaping from the pouch, leading to the swelling of both testicles, referred to as hernia; if it is severe, it is termed as &quot;tao&quot; (placement). The Jueyin meridian of the foot, along with the cold water pathways of Taiyang and bladder, reaches the end of the front yin. </p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; states: When there is illness in the foot Jueyin liver channel, accompanied by fullness and pouch shrinkage, swift treatment is necessary. A large dose of the Chengqi Decoction is advised to purge great heat.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states in the chapter on the meridians: The foot jueyin liver, when harmed by cold, causes the yin to contract inward. Previously, it was mentioned that the pouch retracts due to great heat; now it is said to be due to great cold. It also states: The pouch retracts, causing testicular atrophy, leading to conditions like hernias and edema, due to excessive cold and wind dampness, with retraction indicative of cold. This differs from the earlier two statements; why? It is because, when discussing a healthy person, in summer the intense heat causes the pouch and testicles to hang down, while in winter the severe cold causes them to retract. This differs again from the previous three statements; why? It is stated that for those suffering from cold damaging the pouch and testicles, the heat is internal and it is appropriate to administer purgative decoctions to urgently relieve it. This aligns with the theory of the pouch retracting inward from external severe cold, also indicating internal heat, consistent with the cold damage theory. Hence, reference to a healthy person is used for verification. In winter, the yang energy is internal and the yin energy is external, corresponding in people; thus, when cold is external, the skin tightens, leading to pouch retraction. In summer, the yin energy is internal and the yang energy is external; thus, when heat is external, the skin relaxes, leading to pouch hanging down, resembling the condition of hernias and edema. Although the three statements are different, they are all based on a single principle.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Yin Sores</strong></p>
<p>Yin sores can generally be categorized into three types: the first is damp yin sores; the second is jealousy sores; the third is erosion sores, also known as lower sores. Damp sores are caused by weakness of the kidney channel, where wind and dampness clash, allowing evil qi to take hold, resulting in itchiness and sores with secretions, resembling scabies. Jealousy sores occur when youthful vitality is abundant but overlooked for extended periods, leading to sores on the genitals that are swollen and painful, causing distress and itching. Erosion sores arise from weak kidney energy accompanied by evil forces, with heat accumulating in the lower region, obstructing channels, impeding the flow of qi and blood. Poor hygiene after sexual activity can lead to sores, and if left untreated, they may worsen with severe swelling and internal pain, resulting in difficulty urinating or painful swelling of the genitals. After several days, they may ulcerate, releasing blood and pus, or cause persistent bleeding, culminating in lower sores. If the body shows signs of intense heat, thirst, and aversion to cold, immediate treatment is required. One should soak with a decoction of soybean and licorice, use a poison-cleansing wash, and take blends like five-spice and honeysuckle decoction for relief. Additionally, one can employ a prescription to manage lower sores and apply soothing ointment to the affected areas, followed by careful post-treatment care. For unquenchable thirst, a decoction of bamboo leaves and astragalus is advised. If the stools are soft, one should take a regulating decoction of poria. By following these treatments, recovery is assured.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

One variation adds fennel and aconite. There are also cases of swelling and pain due to water retention.</p>
<p>For those accompanied by deficiency, ginseng and atractylodes should be the principal ingredients, supported by herbs that promote movement. A deep, tight, and large pulse indicates this. If the pulse is unstable upon palpation, it belongs to deficiency; therefore, it is essential to use a combination of cinnamon twig, fried gardenia, and finely cut and stir-fried aconite, powdered and made into pills with ginger juice. Taking thirty to forty pills followed by ginger broth can significantly alleviate pain. Daisigong stated that hernias fundamentally belong to the Jueyin liver meridian.

<p>The &quot;Wood Kidney&quot; refers to a state where the heart fire descends, allowing the kidney water to remain warm; where the true yang flows down, so kidney energy remains harmonized. When both warm and harmonious, how can there be a strong &quot;Wood&quot;? It is only when excessive desires harm within, causing kidney deficiency and fatigue, that yin and yang fail to interact, and water and fire fail to assist each other. This results in persistent cold, stagnation, swelling, and pain, ultimately leading to stubborn blockage and hardness. It is crucial not to rely solely on dryness and heat; rather, one should warm, disperse, and benefit to expel evil. When the evil qi dissipates internally and the defense and nourishment circulate, it is like the cold valley springing back to life.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Abscess in the Sac</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: If an abscess enters the sac, it leads to death. The sac is associated with the Jue Yin (Liver) pathway; if we interpret &quot;death&quot; in this context, does it imply an evil associated with the Shao Yin (Kidney) channel? I have personally witnessed seven or eight cases where the abscess entered the sac, all of which were treated for damp-heat affecting the Liver channel, supplemented with nourishing Yin herbs. Although pus ruptured and the skin fell off, and while the testicles hung down ominously, none of them died. However, I wonder how it is with the elderly or those with chronic deficiencies? An abscess in the sac indicates damp-heat descending. In cases where there is pus, this signifies that dirty qi is moistening downwards and may flow into the urethra, often due to deficiency of the yin passage or obstruction of the urinary pathway. If the pus is exhausted, it can heal by itself without medicine; it only requires proper regulation. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are instances where abdominal swelling gradually flows into the sac, causing severe swelling until the sac ruptures and fluid drains out. For this, apply powdered cedar charcoal externally and wrap it with perilla leaves, and rest on your back to nurture it. Generally, this condition is due to deficiency of the yin passage and damp-heat leading to discharge, so Yin-nourishing and damp-drying herbs are essential. When treating swelling and pain with urinary retention, prioritize eliminating dampness and supplementing Yin. Once the swelling and pain reduce and urination normalizes, treat with a combination of damp-drying and Yin-nourishing herbs. </p>
<p>If pus is desired, focus on removing pathogens as the main approach while supplementing Yin; once the pus forms, puncture it but continue to use the methods of removing pathogens and nourishing Yin. If the damp-heat is entirely resolved, rely solely on removing pathogens. In cases where the pus is clear or either abundant or slow to resolve, apply strong tonics or moxibustion with aconite cakes.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<p>Severe cases of hernia involve acute pain in the testicles and lower abdomen. Pain may be felt in the testicles or near the Wushi acupoint, all of which belong to the Jueyin meridian. There may be physical presence or absence, and sounds can be heard or not. The tangible form resembles a melon, and the sound resembles that of a frog. Since the &quot;Suwen,&quot; famous physicians through the ages have attributed this condition to cold. Cold is known to cause constriction; the channels become cold, leading to stagnation and pain. This reasoning is sound. There are instances of cold without hernia, which may also be linked to obstruction. </p>
<p>I have often experienced cold conditions—snow at the door with frost, water below the navel, and stepping on ice—without falling ill, as I traditionally possess no internal heat. Reflecting on this, I believe the condition arises from damp heat in the meridian, accumulating over time, and compounded by cold external influence; thus, the damp heat is unable to disperse and causes pain. If one solely discusses cold, it may be inadequate. Some may argue that the Jueyin meridian is deep and low in position; how can accumulated damp heat occur? I respond: great exertion brings fire to the heart, gluttony or drunkenness ignites fire in the stomach, sexual exhaustion ignites fire in the kidneys, and intense anger ignites fire in the liver. When fire accumulates in this meridian for long periods, it can deplete its mother, causing dampness to prevail.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>For damp conditions, swelling predominates, which is characteristic of hernias. If there is a combination of deficiency, ginseng and atractylodes should be the main ingredients, supported by guiding herbs. Upon diagnosing the pulse, if it is very deep, tight, but large and without strength, this is indicative. The pain itself is light, merely feeling heavy, pulling, or dragging. </p>
<p>For the lower part when there is no pain, careful consideration shows that abstaining from sexual activity and rich foods is crucial. If one relies solely on medication, they merely shorten their lifespan. Herbs such as white atractylodes, fermented wheat, white angelica, hawthorn, chuanxiong, bitter orange, and pinellia are all necessary. Many tend to regard these herbs as lowly and thereby foster complacency, failing to abandon desires to protect their roots, which is not only unhelpful but often harmful. Additionally, the medication should be adjusted in accordance with the seasonal moisture and cold, following the principles of monarch, minister, and aids.

<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The treatise on the utmost truth states: “The lower abdomen restrains the testicles, affecting the waist and spine, causing a rising sensation to the heart, leading to the expulsion of clear saliva and white fluids, and in severe cases, this sensation may reach the heart, causing sadness and forgetfulness.” The &quot;Classic of Simple and Complex&quot; says: “The pathogen resides in the small intestine.” When suffering from illness in the small intestine, there is pain in the lower abdomen that radiates to the waist and spine, affecting the liver and lungs. If the energy is weak and deficient, then wind-cold can invade. Once the pathogenic energy enters, it manifests as coldness, with symptoms rising to the liver and lungs, causing cold to diffuse in the chest and bind at the navel, pulling on the testicles, rising but unable to descend, causing abdominal pain, affecting the heart and chest, thus correlating with the related meridians.</p>
<p><strong>Bladder Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The treatise on obstruction states: “Bladder obstruction refers to pain in the lower abdomen and bladder; pressing on it causes pain within, as if doused with soup, leading to discomfort during urination, and resulting in clear mucus discharges.” The bladder is a governmental office for the region, where fluid is stored, and when the energy is transformed, it can be released. Now, if wind, cold, and damp pathogenic energy invade the bladder, then the energy cannot be transformed and released, causing fullness in the bladder and obstruction of the water passage. Symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen and bladder; pressing on it causes pain within. If doused with soup, there is discomfort during urination, with the foot’s Taiyang meridian directly affecting its flow, causing connections to the brain above and draining into the nasal passages below, resulting in clear mucus discharge.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Hernia</strong></p>
<p>I humbly note that Zihe&#39;s discussion of the seven sources of hernia disease is quite thorough; however, his prescriptions primarily rely on purgative methods for treatment, which may leave people in doubt. He states that many cases arise from debilitation due to sexual exhaustion, but can one universally apply purgative methods in such instances? Generally speaking, the seven types of hernia, if not caused by sexual exhaustion, may result from long journeys and hardships, crossing waters or walking on ice, which causes hot blood to congeal in the small intestine and bladder; or from damp heat entering the foot&#39;s Jueyin meridian. Ancient prescriptions uniformly considered this as cold complaints, solely utilizing warming herbs like Aconite and Fleeceflower for treatment, while my master Danxi independently determined it as damp heat, revealing an insight not previously recognized. When heat is trapped internally and cold binds externally, it is only natural that there would be extraordinary pain. Therefore, the treatment should expel the damp heat from the affected meridian, dissolve phlegm and blood in the lower jiao, and utilize cold to combat heat in a targeted manner, which makes it easier for the pathogen to subside and the illness to retreat. As for the purgative method, I humbly refrain from attempting it without further scholarly insight.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<p>In men, erectile dysfunction can arise from a decline in the fire of the life gate and a deficiency of essence and energy. This is an established concept.

I have personally witnessed a few individuals with kidney energy affected by stagnant fire presenting this condition. I recommended they take Huangbo and Zhimu to clear fire and strengthen the kidneys, which was effective. Thus, careful investigation is necessary; it should not be hastily attributed solely to diminished fire.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Cao&#39;s Source of Diseases&quot; discusses hernias as painful conditions, referred to by names such as Jue, Zheng, Han, Pan, Qi, Fu, and Lang. These seven names correspond to types of hernias. Jue hernia manifests with cold feet and heart pain, accompanied by vomiting and inability to eat, while Zheng hernia presents with sudden abdominal distension and severe pain beneath the heart, causing gas buildup similar to an arm. A hernia due to cold dietary intake leads to pain in the lower abdomen, termed Han hernia. Qi hernia features intermittent abdominal fullness and pain, while Pan hernia has pain next to the navel. Fu hernia involves accumulation below the navel, and Lang hernia is characterized by pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the genital area, along with difficulty in defecation. Symptoms can be verified upon manifestation. Moreover, there are stone hernias, blood hernias, yin hernias, jealous hernias, and qi hernias—these five have names but lack forms.Externally, there are heart hernias, cold hernias, hunger hernias, and multiple types of hernias, which have different names but share similar illnesses.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In popular usage, these are referred to as &quot;small intestine qi,&quot; &quot;bladder qi,&quot; &quot;running pig qi,&quot; &quot;twisted intestine qi,&quot; &quot;horizontal string,&quot; &quot;vertical string,&quot; &quot;lateral droop,&quot; &quot;wood kidney,&quot; &quot;kidney remnants,&quot; &quot;yin swelling,&quot; and &quot;hernia,&quot; each with distinct names. As for Zhang Zihe’s discussion of the seven hernias, he mentions &quot;cold hernia,&quot; &quot;water hernia,&quot; &quot;muscle hernia,&quot; &quot;blood hernia,&quot; &quot;fox hernia,&quot; &quot;qi hernia,&quot; and &quot;tuǐ hernia,&quot; which differ from other discussions. For example, the &quot;tuǐ hernia&quot; refers to a hard swelling of the outer kidney. If it is painful, it is called &quot;yin swelling&quot;; if not painful, it is &quot;wood kidney&quot;; if it droops on one side, it is &quot;lateral droop.&quot; Although there are many different names and classifications for hernias, the Ling Shu says: the pathogen resides in the small intestine, linking to the testicles and associated with the kidney, and connects to the liver and affects the heart. When the qi is abundant, it causes counterflow of the qi upwards. The Nei Jing further states: when the Ren vessel is affected, men present with seven internal hernias, while women experience discharge and masses. When the Chong vessel is reversed, it leads to urgent qi. Therefore, while the Ren vessel is called a source of disease with the name of seven hernias, it does not manifest the forms of the seven hernias. The Ren vessel is the foundational source of hernia diseases, while the other meridians represent the tributaries of hernia afflictions.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: The Jueyin pulse is slippery for fox hernia, the Shaoyang pulse is slippery for liver wind hernia, the Taiyin pulse is slippery for spleen wind hernia, the Shaoyin pulse is slippery for heart wind hernia, the Taiyang pulse is slippery for kidney wind hernia, and the Yangming pulse is slippery for lung wind hernia. This wind is not an external wind entering, but rather the wind generated by the movement of the liver&#39;s wooden Yang organ energy. These six hernias correspond to the six channels and are located in the five organs. What is meant by hernia diseases being related to the liver? The disease arises from Yin, starting from below; Yin pertains to the internal. The Taiyin (spleen), Jueyin (liver), and Shaoyin (kidney) are all lower Yin channels. The &quot;below&quot; refers to cold energy from the ground; the feet often touch the ground, thus the wind and cold of heaven and earth all enter into the ground, and the wind and dampness in humans arise from the feet. Sometimes due to deficiency in the channels, energy accumulates in the bladder and lower abdomen, where the two Yins converge and the two energies clash, causing pain. Or it could be from excessive cold drinks, causing water to return to the kidneys, or from sitting or lying in dampness, where cold oppresses the Yin, attacking the Yin and resulting in hernia pain. The classic states: Pain indicates passage. When hernia energy causes pain, it should be treated to promote passage rather than block; warmth is preferred over coolness. Promotion means to drain what is real, without draining what is deficient. Cold means to nourish the deficiency, but not to nourish what is real.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The real is the evil qi, and the void is the righteous qi. If the righteous qi is extremely weak, one must first warm it and then drain it. If the evil qi is extremely strong, one must first drain it and then supplement it. Warming must be paired with qi, while draining must be paired with cold. Cold enters the channels and leads the evil, while warmth disperses the qi and nourishes the righteous. Generally, the qi from both inside and outside that enters the kidneys is the kidney qi; that which enters the bladder is the bladder qi; and that which enters the small intestine is the small intestine qi. The kidneys and bladder are organs that are interconnected; their qi communicates and forms the outer kidney, connected to the testes. These three channels are linked and are the site of illness. Their pulse should be string-like and tight; string-like indicates cold, and tight indicates pain. Pain arises from cold, and swelling arises from dampness. If healing is not achieved, the evil qi lingers and accumulates, resulting in pain; either in the sides resembling a cup or in the navel above and below resembling an arm, or the abdomen being distended like a toad, causing one to become emaciated, short of breath, with chills and fevers, excessive sleeping, and poor appetite resulting in fullness and vomiting. The physician should examine attentively; if it is due to emotional disturbances, one should adjust the qi and settle the five organs; if it is caused by external evils, dispersing dampness and expelling cold should take precedence. Eliminating the substantial evil and supplementing the deficient liver will lead to healing, without doubt.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

In such cases, one should purge the Yang to rescue the Yin, and the appropriate remedy would be Da Chengqi Decoction. For contracted tongue in the Jueyin, it is crucial to expel the contents urgently. In such cases, one should promptly use purgative agents.

One should take scallion powder and swallow it with medicinal pills for internal dissolution, or use a salt and wine mixture with different effectiveness. Regardless of the symptoms, one can use fresh material of Wuling powder, adding half or one qian of stir-fried fennel. If the medication is ineffective and the pain is severe and persistent, accompanied by coldness in the hands and feet, one should use Xiangfuzi, stir-fried with salt, and apply it hot wrapped in silk around the navel. If the major and minor bowels are not very open, one may use Wuling powder with cinnamon and add Qingmuxiang pills. If there are initial symptoms such as headache, fever, or aversion to cold with strong heat, one should also use Shen Su Decoction with added Muxiang. If there is Qi reversing and attacking the heart, causing unexpected pain in the heart, one should extract natural juice from fresh leeks, mix it with Wuling powder to form pills, take with fennel soup; this can also be used interchangeably in heart pain symptoms. If there is movement in kidney Qi and heart Qi arises, causing pain above and below, one should take a special decoction with medicinal pills for internal dissolution. Alternatively, focus exclusively on treating the lower pain; once that is resolved, the pain will cease.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Hernia Pain</strong></p>
<p>Hernia pain is related to the Foot Jueyin Liver Channel. The lower abdomen is also associated with the Liver Channel. Therefore, the treatment for hernia pain is the same as that for lower abdominal pain. The so-called hernia refers to pain in the testicles connected to lower abdominal pain. The pain may be solely in the testicles or predominantly in one side of the lower abdomen. When the testicle is swollen like a rice bowl, it is known as a &quot;stomach hernia.&quot; If the pain appears when standing, lying down, moving in and out, it is called a &quot;fox hernia.&quot;</p>
<p>There are three causes of lower abdominal pain due to Qi dynamics: First, a liver condition can cause pain in the lower abdomen and sides. The classics say: &quot;The Jueyin recovery leads to a firm, swollen lower abdomen and violent inner pain.&quot; This arises due to wind and Qi aiding the excessive liver, so the treatment should involve draining the liver. It is also said that in years of excessive metal, people suffer from pain below the ribs and in the lower abdomen. Additionally, in years with insufficient wood, dryness takes hold, causing people distress in the ribs and lower abdomen. Furthermore, in years with inadequate earth, the wind becomes rampant, leading to abdominal pain and subsequently, severe pain in the chest and ribs, radiating to the lower abdomen. This happens when dryness attacks the liver&#39;s deficiency, so the treatment should nourish the liver and drain excess metal.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the small intestine, if the ailment causes pain in the lower abdomen and radiates to the testicles and spinal area, it aligns with the classic reference: &quot;The Shaoyin channel when heated beneath the heart leads to hunger and pain below the navel.&quot;<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: When the Lesser Yin (Shaoyin) recovers, internal heat manifests, causing cramping pain in the lower abdomen; this occurs because heat augments the fullness of the small intestine, and the treatment should focus on purging the small intestine. Furthermore, when the Greater Yang (Taiyang) is at the spring, cold dominates, and in conjunction with the recovery of the Greater Yang, both cause pain in the lower abdomen, affecting the testicles, causing pain that radiates to the waist and spine, and possibly leads to heart pain. When the Greater Yin (Taiyin) governs the heavens, and extreme cold approaches, abdominal pain arises from cold pathogens attacking the deficiency of the small intestine; thus, the treatment should be to supplement the small intestine and dispel the cold pathogens. </p>
<p>The third discusses the bladder; its ailment manifests as pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, along with inability to urinate. The classic states: When the Greater Yin is at the spring, pain and swelling in the lower abdomen with inability to urinate results from damp pathogens attacking the deficiency of the bladder. Therefore, the treatment should supplement the bladder and remove the dampness from the earth.</p>
<p>A slippery pulse observed above the guan indicates great heat, which arises from the combination of Yang and Yang, hence the significant heat. A slippery pulse at the chi position indicates great cold, leading to (inguinal) hernias. The slippery pulse refers to the name of the gate of life, indicating that the fire of the bright and dark yin together in the lower region cannot withstand the cold water, thus resulting in (inguinal) hernias.</p>
<p>In the context of hernias, it is stated: When the Yangming governs the heavens and is overcome by dryness, male (inguinal) hernias occur, along with abdominal pain in females. It is further stated that when Yangming prevails, and external (inguinal) hernias appear, this indicates that the dryness pathogen attacks the liver, resulting in qi deficiency. Therefore, the treatment should be to nourish the liver and dispel the drying metal element.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine [Ming - Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Overindulgence in drink and food, laboring excessively, and the excitement of anger can cause fire to stir. If fire lingers, it generates dampness, leading to the stagnation of fluids into phlegm and turbid matter that flow into the liver channel. The liver is characterized by rapid and violent activity, and when constrained by external cold, this results in severe pain. There are specific cases related to cold, which can indicate issues with the ears. Generally, heat manifests upon exposure; symptoms include red and painful urination, heat in the lower abdomen and rectum, and a sense of urgent fullness in the genitals. In contrast, when exposed to cold, symptoms include smooth, frequent urination, a cool sensation in the flanks and abdomen, and constriction in the external genitals. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are cases where the balance between hot and cold is disrupted, leading to either cold or heat in the external genitals and lower abdomen, with urination either obstructed or frequent. Texts often refer to qi of the small intestine, bladder, and kidney as peripheral issues, but they actually pertain primarily to the liver. The liver encircles the yin organs and connects upwards into the small intestine while both the liver and kidneys are connected downward, associating with the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels. The kidneys and bladder function as organs, with their energies interconnected, functioning as the external kidneys linked to the testicles. These three channels are connected and converge. However, the liver governs the tendons; although the testicles are termed external kidneys, they are not part of the Jueyin, thus the genitals lack the means to contract and expand. In women, this corresponds to the external reproductive organs.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: The pathology resides in the small intestine, connected to the testicular cords which belong to the kidneys, penetrating through the liver and linking to the lungs. The heart is related to vigorous qi, which causes reversal and ascension, while the intestines and stomach affect the liver, disseminating through the diaphragm and settling at the navel, primarily originating from the jueyin region below. When discussing the pulses of the three organs, all are considered slippery when it comes to hernias. When it is said that &quot;wind hernia&quot; occurs, it is not external wind, but rather the wind generated by the movement of the liver&#39;s wood qi. </p>
<p>Speaking of the hernias from the three yang, it is stated that the bladder is not the site of the disease but must transmit to the liver before becoming a hernia. Additionally, the treatment methods at the &quot;Mingtang&quot; point for hernias all target the jueyin part, indicating that the liver meridian is primarily responsible for hernias.</p>
<p>The small intestine is a channel abundant in qi but deficient in blood. Anger, anxiety, and worry arise from the liver, causing stagnation in the heart qi. The heart and small intestine are interlinked, with external qi accumulating without release, attacking the bladder. The kidneys gather qi, yet overexertion in sexual activities can lead to the draining of essence, accumulating as phlegm which causes qi stagnation internally. The channel and true qi of the membranes manifest in bladder distention, all of which are governed by the liver.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the disease manifests, it does not solely cause pain in the external kidneys or lower abdomen, but can also stab the waist and ribs, wander through the chest and back, or present as acute heart pain or circling abdominal pain. In men, it may lead to nocturnal emissions; in women, the cessation of menstruation, causing emaciation and shortness of breath, accompanied by chills and fever, reduced appetite, vomiting, and sour regurgitation. If this persists, it may lead to severe vomiting, further leading to symptoms such as arched back, clenched jaws, profuse cold sweat, and unrelenting cold sweating, making it difficult to treat.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are various types of hernia: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there is testicular pain, it may also be connected to lower abdominal pain. When one is affected by cold or anger, a lump may rise up to the root of the scrotum. When the heart is calm and the energy is balanced, the lump will return to its proper place in the sac.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the case of water hernia, the sac appears like crystal water, may itch and leak yellow fluid, or sweat may occur spontaneously. When pressed, it sounds like water in the lower abdomen. It can result from excessive drinking and engaging in sexual activity, as well as external pathogens accumulating within the sac.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Muscle hernia presents as swelling of the penis, which may either extend long and not retract, or cause extreme pain and itching, usually from excessive sexual activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blood hernia feels like cucumbers on both sides of the lower abdomen, commonly referred to as &quot;toxins of the body.&quot; It can occur from heat in spring and summer, when one’s energy is exhausted, causing blood to seep into the bladder sac and resulting in lumps and swellings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Air hernia connects to the renal region above and the scrotum below. It may arise from prolonged crying and anger, resulting in stagnation and swelling. Laboring while riding may also cause lumps, which can be difficult to treat depending on their size.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fox hernia appears like an inverted tile; when lying down it shifts into the lower abdomen, similar to how a fox comes out of its burrow to urinate during the day and returns at night without urinating. This type shares similarities with air hernia.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The names of these seven types of hernias come from the intentions of classical texts; the rest are erroneous and not to be used. Generally, if hernias persist for a long time, they accumulate and attach around the navel, both above and below, to the left and right, becoming lumps or symptoms. A swelling that is hard and painful like stone indicates the condition, especially in women, where it manifests as a protrusion at the vulva. Pain arises from cold, swelling from dampness; when cold and damp compete, and heat and toxins are added, the swelling hardens like stone. </p>
<p>Intestinal hernia refers to gas in the small intestine, causing hanging and swelling of the outer kidney and itchiness. Ovarian hernia presents as hardened swelling, leading to twisting pain near the navel; if severe, it can cause contraction of the genitals and coldness in the limbs, with ulcers developing on the sac, resulting in boils. Two cases accompanied by continuous discharge of fluid indicate death. </p>
<p>Inflammatory hernia typically arises from underlying damp heat and can be triggered by anger, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, convulsions, a dark complexion, and the testicles shifting, which is termed air hernia. Treatments include medicinal combinations with ingredients like mushroom, pepper, and specific traditional formulations. </p>
<p>For watery hernia, there is great swelling, comparable to a dou (a unit of measurement) or sheng (another unit), without pain or itchiness, usually resulting from excessive dampness. It can be treated with herbal mixtures like Wuling San, adding fennel or chives to form pills, and serving with bamboo shoot soup. In cases of heat, various powders, such as Sanbai San and Juhuo San, can help. For chronic conditions, Juzi He Wan is beneficial.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

<p>For uneven swelling, whether large or small, left-sided swelling suggests excessive stagnant blood and anger, or kidney qi deficiency; right-sided swelling often indicates damp phlegm and food accumulation. Thus, it is important to understand the diagnosis of hernia and the seven types of hernia, and treatment should be thorough. For external treatment, rub with waist ointment.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For damp syndromes, characterized by heaviness of the body, ineffective urination, and possibly loose stools, the best remedy is Wuling San. For damp-heat entering the interior, causing severe pain, modify Chai Ling Tang or Ba Zheng San.

<p>Wuling San is generally applicable. Zhu Ling and Ze Xie balance yin and yang to harmonize the heart and small intestine, Bai Zhu helps with moisture and stagnant blood in the waist; Fu Ling aids the bladder&#39;s water.

If it persists, use the San Yu Nei Xiao Pill. Generally, for deficiency hernias, excessive tonification is inappropriate. The classics say: where evils converge, their energy must be deficient. If remaining without release, the illness becomes real. One must first drain the accumulated heat before tonifying; hence many formulas borrow from the energy of euphorbia.</p>
<p>If deficiency is severe, leading to vomiting and sperm leakage, it is critical. It is essential to recognize that damp heat is the illness; both should be treated with drainage from the south and tonification from the north, and harsh agents should not be recklessly used.</p>
<p>For prolonged symptoms of masses and abdominal fullness like an arm, use the White Onion Powder or the Adjusting Middle Decoction with added Ferula.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yin Shi (Yin Erosion)</strong></p>
<p>Yin erosion sores occur when a woman&#39;s uterus has stagnant impurities or when menstrual discharge is not clear. If she has intercourse without washing afterwards, and the man has kidney deficiency with damp pathogens blocking the energy, it can lead to swelling and pain in the penis and testicles, with painful urination resembling a drip.</p>
<p><strong>Yang Mei (Yang Mei Sore)</strong></p>
<p>If it has long been ulcerated, invading the muscles, with continuous bleeding, it becomes a lower sore (xie), which, if not healed for a long time, develops into a Yang Mei sore. It is advisable to take Xian Yi Liang soup as a preventive measure. </p>
<p>For a body feeling hot and strong heat with aversion to cold, urgent treatment is necessary. If there is deficiency of Yin blood with heat, Small Chai Hu Decoction should be taken with ginseng, atractylodes, spicy angelica, and return herb; for swelling, pain, and fever, Four Substances Decoction should be added with Chai Hu and gardenia; if there is damp heat and pain, breaking out with cold or heat symptoms, Small Chai Hu Decoction should be supplemented with gentian, coptis, and green skin; if heat dominates causing constipation, Eight Correcting Powder should be used; if severe damp heat causes swelling and painful urination with shrinking penis, or discharge of white fluid, Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction should be taken. </p>
<p>If there is Qi deficiency, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be taken with gentian and gardenia; for unending thirst, Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction should be used.

<p>In summary, the root of this condition lies in Yin deficiency of the Liver meridian, while swelling and pain are symptoms.

<p>Itching in the genitals with white discharge is often due to a weakness of the spleen and earth, which fails to nourish metal and water.

<p>At the initial onset, there is swelling, redness, pain, difficulty in urination, chills and fever with thirst. One should clear the liver fire and disperse the damp heat to relieve it. Black Dragon Decoction and Kidney-Strengthening Pills are recommended. If it arises from sexual activity, and the cyst is as large as a bowl, with abdominal bloating, heat in urination, dry mouth, and phlegm obstruction, it is critically urgent. Kidney Qi Pills should be used, adding Plantago seeds and Achyranthes, decocted and taken with Kidney-Strengthening Pills. If after draining damp heat there is still swelling and pain, one should nourish Yin and expel it to hasten the maturation of the pus for needling. If pus forms and there is constipation, it indicates heat toxin obstruction; one should use remedies to dispel toxins and support the interior. If it does not lessen, the heat toxins are not cleared; one should use Liver-Enhancing Decoction. Once pus has formed, use the Life-Saving Decoction. </p>
<p>If the pus bursts and the skin sloughs off, with the testicles hanging, or if a muscle strand remains inside and does not dissolve, and the scrotum completely rots, beneath the penis at the cyst, it also rots like half a pen tube.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Principles: Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>Diseases of the Anterior Yin</strong>  </p>
<p>Impotence: The prescription texts say that when a man is robust, he thinks of intimacy. The Inner Canon states that in a man of twenty-eight, the vital energy is abundant, and the yin and yang overflow. However, if there is excessive depletion, and the seminal fluid is exhausted, then the yang channels become weak, leading to impotence. Even middle-aged men may be able to perform but lack vigor, all due to insufficient essence. Those who are unaware hastily categorize this as yang deficiency and blindly resort to medicines like cassia, ashwagandha, epimedium, and cistanche, which merely aggravate the evil fire and deplete the true yin. This can culminate in a sudden stroke and death, but no one realizes it. Zhu Xi said that after having children, one should not lose even a little essence, for it is truly a life-preserving strategy. People only recognize desire and do not appreciate the value of life, recklessly pushing their limits on a perilous path, which is truly lamentable.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one has no children but possesses this condition, one must greatly nourish the qi and blood, enhance yin and assist essence, supplemented with ingredients such as deer antler, deer horn glue, epimedium, and cynomorium, in order to concurrently nourish the fire of the life gate and stimulate the original yang. One must also carefully assess the deficiency or excess of qi and blood. For overweight individuals, one should greatly supplement qi and gather the essence; for underweight individuals, nourishing yin should take precedence, focusing on the Eight Ingredients Pill. For thin people, the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, combined with goji berries, dodder, schisandra, and deer horn glue, works well. </p>
<p>For impotence, one should attribute it to excessive decline of essence. The classic states: when the liver meridian of the foot is injured internally, it does not rise. The Eight Ingredients Pill from Zhongjing is particularly effective. In severe cases, one may add ginseng, deer glue, and deer antler, or add epimedium, cynomorium, and goji berries, which also supports the fire of the right kidney. Although it has been previously mentioned that one should not carelessly use drugs like cinnamon and aristolochia to concoct the true yin, if it truly pertains to a deficiency of true yang, one should indeed nourish the source of fire; thus, there is no need to rigidly adhere to the earlier discussion. </p>
<p>Yin sweating and yin odor are both related to damp heat in the lower body, resulting from excessive indulgence in overly rich alcohol and flavors; for this, Longdan Decoction for Liver Drainage is excellent.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

For阴 pain, it is advisable to soothe stagnation and harmonize the blood; add Xiangfu and Honghua to the Four Substances Decoction. According to &quot;Qianjin Fang,&quot; if someone experiences a gradual onset of阴 cold, with swelling and a fullness in the scrotum, causing persistent dull pain day and night, grind high-quality Chuanjiao into powder, wrap it in silk and apply to the area; if there is no sensation of heat, applying warmth is even better, adjusting to the person’s sensitivity.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Suspended Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>For burning pain or fever, clear the liver and detoxify. If there is swelling and pain, focus on detoxifying. If there is swelling and pain with dark, turbid urine, it is due to damp-heat in the liver channel; one should promote urination and clear the liver. If there is no pus or no abscess, it indicates qi and blood deficiency; one should nourish them. </p>
<p>A suspended carbuncle is said to arise behind the pubic area and before the urinary tract, related to the deficiency of the three yin of the foot. If mild, it may lead to leakage, draining qi and blood until depletion; if severe, it may rupture internally, resulting in immediate danger. If it initially arises from damp-heat stagnation, producing pain without forming pus, or if there is stagnation in urination, use Longdan Xie Gan Decoction. If the swelling and pain are severe, use Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction with honey-prepared licorice as an assistant. In such cases, even if there is illness, it remains light, and if it ulcerates, it is shallow. </p>
<p>If pus cannot form or if the pus forms but does not rupture, use Bazhen Powder to tonify. If the pus has formed, treat urgently with needles. To promote muscle regeneration and contraction, if there&#39;s kidney deficiency, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan; for blood deficiency, use Sijunzi Decoction with additional ginseng and atractylodes; for qi deficiency, use Si Junzi Decoction with added chuanxiong and angelica; for spleen deficiency, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction; and for both qi and blood deficiency, use Bazhen Decoction or Shiquan Dabu Decoction. If cold and cool substances are used to detoxify, it would lead to complications. </p>
<p>The suspended carbuncle fundamentally stems from Yin deficiency of the liver and kidney channels, requiring supplementation. If not treated in the early stage, or if pus forms and is mistakenly attacked, what awaits is death! It is essential to treat early swelling and pain, or dark turbid urine by initially using honey-prepared licorice for one or two doses, followed by moxibustion with garlic, and further administering Longdan Xie Gan Decoction. If there is fever with swelling and pain, add Cheqianzi, Huangbo, chuanxiong, and angelica to Xiao Chaihu Decoction.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When pus has formed, administer acupuncture. If it has already ruptured, use Eight Treasures Decoction with added licorice, as well as Chaihu and roasted Huangbo and Zhimu. For those with cloudy urine and a strong pulse, continue with Longdan Xia Gan Decoction, adding licorice. For those with cloudy urine and a weak pulse, use Qixing Lianzi Drink with added licorice. If the pus is clear and does not coalesce, use a major tonic formula, alternating with fermented soybean cakes. If it does not coalesce over time, also apply aconite cakes with moxibustion, and it will be effective.</p>
<p>If a boil arises in the waterway before and after consuming food, it is called a hanging boil. It occurs in the area before the anus and behind the scrotum, forming a lump resembling an olive or a plum. Initially, it is not painful, but over ten days it gradually becomes hot. If not treated early, the sore will rupture, and pus and blood will flow out in large amounts, leading to severe suffering akin to the intestines rotting with stools exiting through the sore. This can last for months, or even up to one or two years. It is essential to treat the lump before it becomes painful with licorice paste. After just one or two doses, it will dissipate on its own. This condition initially appears the size of a pine nut, gradually enlarging to the size of a lotus seed; after several days, it begins to swell red like peach or plum, and eventually bursts. If it bursts, it becomes difficult to treat. Although this medicine may not cause immediate disappearance, it will definitely resolve in over twenty days. Taking two doses poses no harm.</p>
<p>Generally, this condition pertains to yin deficiency, hence those who are deficient in essence are more susceptible. Cooling and cold medicines should not be overused, for fear of harming the stomach qi. Only licorice as an ingredient does not harm qi and blood nor disturb the organs, and its effects are quite swift.</p>
<p>As for toxins in the urine, if internal heat toxins are combined with external cold evils, disperse them. For those affected by labor, provide nourishment.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

<p>Bowel abscesses associated with the jueyin liver meridian involve internal heat and external cold, possibly due to overstrain, irregular sexual activity, unfulfilled desires, or strong retention of essence, or due to damp heat in the liver meridian. For treating internal heat and external cold, use the Shuangjie San; for overexertion, apply the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for irregular sexual activity, use the Liu Wei Wan; for unfulfilled desires, begin with Wu Ling San plus Da Huang to relieve the stagnation of essence, followed by Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys and strengthen the essence. If there is damp heat stagnation, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang is appropriate for guiding the liver and easing stagnation.</p>
<p>Bowel abscesses are essentially blood stagnation related to the jueyin liver meridian and its connecting vessels, as well as the channels of Chong, Ren, and Du. In women, this often manifests as swelling and pain in the lower abdomen or hard lumps, along with difficulty in urination. If treatment is done correctly and the patient is also able to regulate themselves, it should not be difficult to resolve. However, if large doses of Da Huang are used to eliminate heat from the body, or to force pus out through the bowels, leading to a loss of qi and blood, combined with carelessness regarding daily routines and diet, this will hinder recovery.</p>
<p>In general, bowel abscesses are blood stagnation. Commonly referred to as bowel toxins, it occurs at areas of difficulty, thus affecting the jueyin liver meridian and the channels of Chong, Ren, and Du, which are also secondary pathways of the liver. This is a blockage leading to swelling and pain, which is caused by heat toxins. Therefore, it is important first to relieve the stagnation, then apply medicines to clear and resolve.

<p>For swelling and pain that has not yet formed pus, disperse the liver and guide out dampness. For swelling that is hard and hot, clear the liver and reduce heat. For swelling that is painful and has formed pus, use urgent acupuncture, and then drink a detoxifying formula. If it has already burst, nourish yin and promote drainage. If the pus is clear and does not close, greatly supplement qi and blood. </p>
<p>An abscess is associated with yin deficiency and damp-heat descending in the liver and kidneys.

If damp-heat recedes yet there is still swelling and pain, nourish yin and promote drainage to hasten pus formation. If pus is hot and there is constipation, it indicates heat and toxicity blocking. First use a detoxifying dispersing agent, then acupuncture to release it; once the pus is gone, symptoms will resolve. If the pus is gone but swelling and pain do not diminish, it indicates unresolved heat and toxicity, use a liver-clearing and nourishing decoction. </p>
<p>Dry mouth and frequent urination indicate kidney deficiency and heat; use Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills. Internal heat and afternoon fever indicate blood deficiency in the liver; use Four Substance Decoction with ginseng and atractylodes. If there is fatigue and decreased appetite, it indicates spleen qi deficiency with heat; use the Middle Strengthening Qi Decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Hernia</strong></p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; states that the Ren channel is the origin of the seven types of hernias, collectively termed as hernia syndromes. The so-called types are: Chong hernia, Fox hernia, Tai hernia, Jue hernia, Jia hernia, Gui hernia, and Gui stranguria, which detail the conditions of the seven hernias. The Chao family does not fully investigate the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; which originally contains the seven hernias; instead, they forcefully categorize cold, symptom, qi, band, attachment, and wolf hernia, mistakenly associating these with the seven hernias. Is this not absurd? Zhang Zihe rightly criticizes them, saying this is a misleading name established by ordinary practitioners. Their argument merely distinguishes the lower organs without any relation to the small intestine, bladder, and kidneys, yet it solely attributes disease to the liver channel. They completely fail to recognize that the Ren channel is the origin of the seven hernias, nor do they understand that the classic texts contain scattered references to the seven hernias within various discussions. They erroneously add cold, water, tendons, blood, qi, fox, and Tai as seven additional types; such flaws are not different from those of the Chao family. </p>
<p>If one argues that hernias stem from tendon diseases, it should be noted that they involve liver evils. If one merely states this is confined to the Jueyin channel, it contradicts the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; does it not? Furthermore, dealing with diseases located below by simply expelling them, without considering deficiency or excess, leads to generalized purging, and its associated dangers are beyond description. Can one expect vitality to be restored just by supplementing after purging? Students should regard the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; as the correct authority and should not be misled by myriad detours.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Danxi believed that all cases of hernia begin with damp-heat. When one overexerts, fire arises from the tendons; when one is drunk or overly full, fire arises from the stomach; when there is sexual exhaustion, fire arises from the kidneys; and when there is great anger, fire arises from the liver. If fire stagnates for long, dampness becomes excessive, turbid fluids congeal, merging into the blood channels and flowing to the Jueyin. The liver&#39;s nature is swift, constrained by cold, hence the pain is considerable. This, too, supplements a point not previously addressed by others and should not be rigidly held as a standard. Therefore, in terms of treatment, with cold there is much pain, with heat there is much movement, with dampness there is swelling and dragging, and with deficiency there is also swelling and dragging. In the blood phase, there is little movement, while in the qi phase, there is much activity. There are two testicles: the left one belongs to water, which generates wood in the liver; wood generates fire in the heart. All three sections govern blood, and the main source of the left blood is the liver. The right testicle belongs to fire, which generates earth in the spleen; earth generates metal in the lungs. All three sections govern qi, and the main source of the right qi is the lung.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when all cold is collected and withdrawn, the blood weeps and returns to the liver, infusing into the left testicle; when all qi is obstructed and stagnant, dampness accumulates and returns to the lung, infusing into the right testicle. Furthermore, the sinews connected to the testicles do not solely derive from the Jueyin, but also include those of the Taiyin and Yangming. Hence, in the case of left testicle afflictions, there is more pain and less swelling; in the case of right testicle afflictions, there is less pain and more swelling; this is certain. </p>
<p>The Seven Hernia Symptoms according to the Nest Clan: Jue hernia is characterized by reversed cold in the heart, leading to vomiting of food. Zhen hernia manifests as a sudden fullness in the lower abdomen causing pain, with qi accumulating like a swollen arm. Han hernia is due to cold beverages and food causing pain in the side of the abdomen. Qi hernia occurs with sudden fullness and relief, accompanied by pain. Pan hernia causes pain beside the navel. Fu hernia presents with accumulation of gas beneath the navel. Wolf hernia causes pain in the lower abdomen connected to the genitals, resulting in difficulty with bowel movements. </p>
<p>Xiaochang qi pertains to diseases of the small intestine. When the lower abdomen pulls on the testicles, it must connect to the waist and spine causing pain. If the small intestine is weak, wind and cold can invade, and once the pathogenic qi enters, it obstructs, violently affecting the liver and lung, pulling the testicles up and preventing them from descending. </p>
<p>Bladder qi refers to swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, with inability to urinate.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

<p>For fox hernia, when lying down it enters the abdomen, and when standing it exits the abdomen. When Zhongjing treats fox hernia, he sometimes uses &quot;spider powder.&quot; There are those who use six liang of oyster, salt mud for solidification, three jin of charcoal, calcined until the fire is exhausted, taking two liang, and one liang of dry ginger, baked into fine powder. Mix these two ingredients, adjust with water, and apply to the painful area; if urination is impeded, it will cure.</p>
<p>As for hernia (with symptoms of testicular swelling), the scrotum swells to the size of a hand or a bucket, and in severe cases, as large as a gourd: use three-layered fennel pills, lychee kernel powder, Xuanbiao pills, and Rehmannia paste pills. If there is no pain in the kidney, use Nanshen, Banxia, Huangbo, Cangzhu, Zhishi, Hawthorn, Baizhi, Shenqu, Huashi, Zhuyu, and Kombu to make a wine paste pill and take with salt soup. For male mulberry leaves that do not seed, dry them into powder, make a wine paste pill, and take with salt soup. Additionally, use Verbena to pound and apply, it is effective.</p>
<p>For reversal hernia, the spleen is affected by liver evil, causing qi stagnation and accumulation.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those with severe liver imbalance, formulas such as Danggui Sijun Decoction, Chuan Kuliang Powder, and Muxiang Lianzi Powder are recommended. For those with masses and hernias, if there is heat and pain in the lower abdomen along with white discharge, these are symptoms of the hernia described by the Zhao family, related to the muscles described by Zihe. Danxi mentions that internal stagnation of damp-heat resembles this hernia; thus, Wutou Zhizhi Decoction can be used, possibly augmented with tangerine pits, peach kernels, or Wuzhuyu. Danxi states that when Yangming is affected by damp-heat, this can transmit to Taiyang, causing fever and chills, closed pain in the lower abdomen, and preparations including Zhizi, Tao Ren, Zhi Shi, and Hawthorn should be decocted together with fresh ginger juice. </p>
<p>For hernias considered as serious conditions, which are linked to Yangming muscle diseases and contain pus and blood within, this is similar to the attached hernia described by the Zhao family and the blood hernia by Zihe. Ingredients like peach kernels, Yanhusuo, licorice, Poria, Atractylodes, Zhi Shi, Hawthorn, tangerine pits, and lychee seeds should be used. </p>
<p>For cases of strangury hernia characterized by pus and blood and inability to urinate, add flavored Tongxin Powder or modify Wuling Powder with peach kernels and hawthorn.

<p>For cold hernia, it is advisable to use warming agents, such as Yugong San or modified Wuling San with Qingmuxiang Wan, or similar remedies like Wuju and Pancong. For water hernia, use Yugong San, Sanhua Shenyuan Wan, or Daoshui Wan to expel water. For muscle hernia, use agents that reduce heart fire, primarily Xiexin Decoction. For blood hernia, it is best to use Yuzhu San, which is a blood-regulating remedy. For qi hernia, use qi-dispersing medicines, with Dangher Wan or Pancong San as the main treatments. For fox hernia, use agents that disperse stagnant qi. For (disease-causing) hernia, remedies to eliminate dampness should be applied, such as Sanhua or Shenyuan Wan. If the primal spirit is weak and subjected to cold, it may cause small intestine hernia with rolling pain; treat with Pancong San, adding Guozhi, Xiaohui, Chuanlianzi, and similar ingredients. If the body is robust but suffers from small intestine qi pain or difficulty in urination, use Bazheng San with Zhaoguozhi, Xiaohui, and Chuanlianzi.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Swelling of the Genitals</strong></p>
<p>The swelling of the genitals stems from the accumulation of heat in the bladder, compounded by wind and dampness; it may also result from damp heat flowing through, or from hernias causing turmoil; or from sudden wind and heat, and the crying of children, causing a buildup of anger; or from toxins blown in by insects. Carefully analyze the causes and apply the appropriate treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Hernia</strong></p>
<p>If the hernia pulse is tight and urgent with a rapid rate, it indicates heat and pain. The classics state: &quot;The spleen transmits to the kidney, the condition is called hernia and lump.&quot; If there is discomfort and pain in the lower abdomen accompanied by white discharge, it is referred to as &quot;gu&quot; (a kind of malady). This indicates pain in the lower abdomen and discharge of white liquid. It could also be due to internal accumulation of guest heat, consuming fat and flesh, resembling the food of &quot;gu,&quot; hence it is named &quot;gu.&quot; However, the classics again assert that heat causes hernia and lump, which should not be mistaken for just cold; it must be discerned through pulse and symptoms. According to the &quot;Record of Discrepancies&quot;: whenever one sees a male with small intestinal hernia, the pain is unbearable, the scrotum is swollen and may sag to one side; during an episode, palpating the small intestine produces a sound like a frog, the shape resembles peach, plum, or papaya; if the mass rises, the face turns black, if it sags, it falls to the ground. The patient cannot endure the pain, and all doctors cannot discern its mechanism. Some say: &quot;Hernia originates from the liver meridian and has no connection with the kidney meridian,&quot; fearing it is an incomplete explanation. In truth, hernia primarily involves the liver, while the heart and kidney are secondary. The condition often arises from damp heat and anger damaging the liver, excessive sexual exertion causing stagnation in the heart and kidney, leading to the small intestine’s outer membrane being blocked with gathered qi, resulting in such a state. Some say: &quot;Using the heart and kidney as secondary, the excessive sexual exertion is only speaking of the kidney.&quot;<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For example, when a child suffers from a tilt due to excessive sexual activity, how does this condition arise? It is said that the child inherits damp heat from the parents, which causes stagnation in the small intestine and results in the tilt, yet does not produce pain. During middle age, if sexual activity is excessive, it damages one&#39;s true essence, the protective energy becomes deficient, and the kidney pathogen rises, leading to recurring and unmanageable pain. In contemporary society, the treatment for cold pathogens or stagnation typically employs aromatic and drying substances, or utilizes da huang, qian niu, and ba shuang to hasten bowel movements, which ultimately harms the vital energy and exacerbates the illness. </p>
<p>I have consulted the principles regarding the small intestine, which holds more qi and less blood. If the heart qi becomes stagnant, the organs can suffer from pathogens; if liver qi thrives, then the offspring will also flourish. Thus, the two energies invade the small intestine and bladder, causing pain. The patient may find it bearable to touch the area but is unaware that the membrane gradually widens, and the qi becomes increasingly intense. Taking medication cannot avoid dietary restrictions, and as time passes and roots become deep, it&#39;s difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Commonly, the Wu Ling San is used with added qi-regulating herbs, showing many effective results, but rarely does it successfully expel the pathogen through urination. The properties of the herbs are such that Zhu Ling and Ze Xie balance yin and yang, harmonizing the heart and small intestine qi; Bai Zhu regulates the spleen and facilitates the removal of dampness and dead blood from the navel and waist; Fu Ling gently promotes the bladder&#39;s water; Gui can quell liver pathogens; Hui Xiang is good for treating small intestine qi; Jin Ling Zi and Ju Zi clear the bladder&#39;s qi; Bing Lang descends qi; and a small amount of Mu Tong is added to guide the small intestine&#39;s pathogens out. This has been repeatedly confirmed in practice. </p>
<p>The wood kidney represents stubborn damp heat, becoming hard and lump-like, yet it does not cause pain. The treatment should warm, disperse, and unblock to expel it.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about hernia: In ancient methods, some considered it a small intestine issue, while others viewed it as a bladder concern. However, only Zi He and Dan Xi specifically address it as related to the liver channel, which presents differing opinions. How can we distinguish among them? </p>
<p>The small intestine issue pertains to the disease of the small intestine; the bladder issue relates to the disease of the bladder; hernia is a disease of the liver channel. These three are certainly distinct. In ancient times, people mistakenly thought small intestine and bladder issues were hernias. Little did they know that the foot Jueyin channel encircles the reproductive organs and extends to the lower abdomen. When a person suffers from this condition, the swelling and pain in the testicles extending to the lower abdomen indicates that the hernia is associated with the liver channel. The small intestine issue, colloquially known as horizontal or vertical cord, travels around the navel and pains the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The bladder&#39;s Qi is situated above the hairline, and the pain in the lower abdomen differentiates itself, bearing resemblance to hernia with visible form like a melon and a sound like a frog. However, it differs as to whether it rises in the abdomen or descends into the pouch. Yet the small intestine and bladder, due to the channels being connected to the Jueyin meridian, can also be affected by diseases related to the liver, which may cause pain that radiates down to the testicles; this is merely a disease of the two meridians and cannot be classified as a hernia. </p>
<p>Zhao Yide states: This entry originally established the name concerning the testicles. However, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; defines hernia as pain, referring to the pain of the internal organs in the abdomen, hence it is named after hernia, allowing for a generalized discussion here. The hernia of the five organs in the abdomen can thus be examined here. The pain of the testicles is said by the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; to be a disease of the Ren meridian, indicating that men internally suffer from seven hernias while women deal with discharges and masses. The Chong meridian is where the disease manifests, with inverted Qi causing urgency. However, the Ren meridian bears the name of seven hernias without exhibiting the form of seven hernias.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is hardly possible to speak of this duality of names without considering the pathways of the Ren channel as they correspond to the various meridians, leading to the seven types of hernias. Furthermore, to mention only one type of hernia is to recognize the Taiyin channel at the Qian point, where excessive cold energy flows backward, potentially resulting in a hernia. The Yangming channel at the Qian point may cause pain in the lower abdomen, affecting the testicles and leading to heart pain; there is pain in the lower abdomen that hinders urination or defecation, termed a hernia due to cold. </p>
<p>In cases of the Foot Taiyin channel involved, there may be pain at the genital area that radiates upwards to the navel. A rapid pulse in the heart indicates a heart hernia, while the small intestine is the origin, associating with a notable presence in the lower abdomen. The kidney pulse being significantly rapid and slippery indicates a hernia, while a sliding and rapid heartbeat indicates a heart hernia, and a sinking pulse in the lungs corresponds to a lung hernia, with three Yin channels being linked to hernia occurrences. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that a fine and slippery heart pulse indicates a heart hernia, and the liver pulse being very slippery indicates a serious hernia.</p>
<p>The spleen pulse being slightly large indicates hernial qi, signifying large abscesses of pus and blood beyond the intestines; being excessively slippery suggests a significant hernia. A markedly slippery kidney pulse suggests a serious case as well. Slippery pulses indicate abundant Yang energy and slight heat. Hence, this signifies the seven hernias, centered around the disturbance of cold and heat within the body. The &quot;Neijing&quot; further states: a slippery Jueyin pulse results in fox hernia; a slippery Shaoyin pulse leads to lung wind hernia; a slippery Taiyin pulse results in spleen wind hernia; a slippery Yangming pulse indicates heart wind hernia; a slippery Taiyang pulse leads to kidney wind hernia; a slippery Shaoyang pulse signifies liver wind hernia. The term &quot;wind&quot; here is not referring to external pathogens but rather the internal dynamic-driven wind of the liver&#39;s wood element. Thus, the classics say that a sliding pulse indicates wind.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition referred to as &quot;hernia&quot; occurs because the kidney and liver reside in the lower jiao together.

This too is treated with heat. The Inner Canon does not strictly limit discussions to the pulse at the wrist; is it not due to external cold obstructing internal heat? It is said that heat transforms from cold, which may not be appropriate reasoning. The text further alludes to &quot;protrusions,&quot; related to the body&#39;s mechanisms, the states of yin and yang, and the pathways of fluids.

Why do I say this? It is because, when speaking of the kidneys and their division into four regions, they belong to the cold water of the five elements, and when considering their position in the lower part, they are associated with the yin of the earth. The yin form is dual, hence there are two kidneys; their dual forms establish the rigidity and flexibility of the earth path. Encased between these two forms, they receive and emit the essence and blood of the kidneys, facilitating the transformation and generation of the earth, resulting in the myriad shapes and beings, as well as the growth and aging, and the essence that supports strength and skill—all are dependent on this.&quot;<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, the earth (Kun) stands in reverence, yet does not perform its duties. Those who perform these duties are the two vessels, Chong and Ren, which arise from within the womb and carry out their transformations. Thus, the channels of the five organs and six bowels all receive energy from the six vessels, hence they are referred to as the sea. Therefore, the two vessels are esteemed for their circulation and detested for their obstruction. When there is circulation, the yang energy of heaven descends and engages with it, leading to the flow of transformative principles; when there is obstruction, the yang of heaven is cut off, and as a result, the yin of the earth also becomes stagnant, leading to various diseases. Thus, hernias are caused by these two factors. For illnesses of the Ren vessel, if there is a struggle between yin and yang, or an invasion by external evils, both can cause an imbalance of yin and yang. When yin prevails, cold energy strikes; when yang prevails, heat energy enters, and when yin reacts from the outside, all these lead to issues with the Ren vessel and result in hernias. Even if the evil does not arise directly from the Ren vessel but initially derives from the energies received by each channel, it must still conflict with the Ren vessel.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What are the offenses committed? Some may involve the meridians being transmitted through victories, or receiving without following the proper sequence, or the Ren meridian interacting with the evil of other meridians, or the six meridians receiving qi at certain times, carrying evil and affecting the Sea of Qi, all of which can stimulate the Ren meridian. This leads to a solid and unchanging accumulation of yin within, striking the organs and creating abdominal hernia, while descending and entering the Jueyin to meet with the genital area results in testicular hernia. Indeed, hernia has its own distinct name and solely pertains to the duty of the Ren meridian. It arises specifically from yang in the ground, being triggered by external factors. If other meridians receive evil and do not pertain to the Ren, it cannot be called hernia. Otherwise, why do the Inner Classic&#39;s Pain chapter and the Spiritual Pivot&#39;s chapter concerning the onset of diseases specifically elucidate the pains of the abdominal meridians without mentioning hernia? This clearly shows that the Ren meridian is the source of hernia disease. What the other meridians describe as hernia is merely their offshoots. As for the seven types of hernias described by the Cao clan—Jue, Zheng, Han, Qi, Pan, Fu, and Lang—along with their signs, they merely indicate that the accumulation of yin qi within, exacerbated by cold, disrupts the balance of Nutritive and Defensive qi, leading to weakened blood and qi, and thus cold air entering the abdomen results in hernia. In young children, hernia (or &quot;Gu&quot;) is often due to the swelling of the yin nucleus, caused by incessant crying and movement of yin qi, resulting from a gathering that does not disperse. Observing the five types of hernias, all manifest as pain in the heart and abdomen, while only the &quot;Gu&quot; hernia belongs to childhood ailments.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Later generations have elaborated on these teachings, further referencing the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; where it states that the spleen wind transmits to the kidneys, known as gu. In cases of hernia and abdominal pain, it is also termed gu disease. Additionally, there is a classification of yin hernia, which is (decaying) hernia, categorized into seven types. This refers to the treatments for pain in the heart and abdomen, which suggests: if harmed by the seven emotions, one should regulate qi and calm the five organs; if disturbed by external evils, one should warm and disperse it. Improper treatment can lead to the internal and external qi entering the kidneys, becoming kidney qi; entering the bladder, becoming bladder qi; and entering the small intestine, becoming small intestine qi. The kidney and bladder are one organ and one viscera, and their qi communicates with the outer kidney. The small intestine is linked to the testes; thus, they are interconnected. It is also said that yin hernia is another term for (decaying) hernia, with four varieties: intestine, qi, egg, and water. Zhang Dairen refuted this, stating that these are erroneous names introduced by common practitioners. This condition arises in the area of the yin organs, pressuring the lower abdomen, and belongs to the channel of the foot jueyin liver. It is a site vulnerable to hernia. Either due to cold water constraining, causing stagnation in this channel; or because of dry heat from heaven, with wood qi suppressed in this channel; or from anger, sorrow, and worry, which constricts the channel; or from external medications solidifying, closing off and constraining vitality in this channel. It does not involve the bladder, kidneys, or small intestines but is the responsibility of the jueyin liver channel. In general, hernia is not caused by the liver wood being attacked by evils; rather, it is a disorder of the liver wood itself. Hence, within the classification of yin hernia, seven types are defined: cold, water, tendons, blood, qi, fox, and (decaying).<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

This is clearly stated in previous discourse. The points of treatment for hernia often converge with the Ren Vessel. Furthermore, it mentions that the Chong, Ren, and Du vessels meet at the pubic bone, surrounding the Yin organs. Additionally, it states that excessive spermatic fluid resulting in sexual indulgence represents male hernia; while in women, symptoms like blood stagnation, absence of menstruation, heat in the lower back and knees, dry throat, and abdominal lumps indicate female hernia.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the words of those who argue are rigid and focused solely on one aspect, they no longer consider the other. In conditions like (disease-related) hernias, there can be discernible external signs of the six meridians. If there are indeed symptoms associated with the bladder or small intestine, how could one ignore them? As the &quot;Lingshu&quot; states, a disease of the small intestine manifests as pain in the lower abdomen and pain that radiates from the lower back to the testicles; the treatment methods are likewise clear. Because the disease is in the lower body, one must first address the lower area, without needing to consider the fragile condition of individuals where treatment at both ends would not be appropriate. If one does treat the inappropriate areas, they may encounter untoward consequences, and can one simply wait until after treatment to then offer nourishment to bring back life? However, the texts of physicians are direct in their wording and clear in meaning, causing readers to feel enlightened and to dispel the obstructions in their minds; they are indeed the pinnacle of all medical texts. Yet, upon closer examination, one finds a lack of warmth and nuanced repetition in their ideas. Moreover, with the endless changes of yin and yang, diseases arise in countless forms, and treatment methods are also infinite—the insights of any one person are insufficient. Scholars should build upon what is already known and enhance their understanding of what is not, thus enabling them to effectively utilize these texts.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Danxi once discussed the sudden pain in the testicles connected to the lower abdomen, which may manifest as tangible or intangible, audible or inaudible. People often believe this is due to cold obstructing the meridians, causing pain. However, they do not realize that this ailment originates from damp heat, which, when stagnant for a long time, is further affected by external cold dampness and heat, leading to pain. The initial cause of damp heat arises from significant exertion, which raises fire in the heart; overindulgence or drunkenness raises fire in the stomach; excessive sexual activity raises fire in the kidneys; and extreme anger raises fire in the liver. When fire stagnates for too long, dampness increases, thick liquids congeal, and flow into the Jueyin (the outermost yin), affecting it. The liver is associated with wood, which is quick and vigorous, and fire nature is aggressive; thus, when bound by cold, pain intensifies and becomes acute. This reasoning also sheds light on the areas affected in Jueyin conditions, providing valuable insights for future scholars.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cause of hernia lies in these three types of evils: heat leading to swelling, cold resulting in pain, and dampness causing accumulation. Treatment must address the amount of each. When both testicles are affected, that is certainly the case. If there is a tendency towards one, I cannot disregard its significance. </p>
<p>The kidneys are paired, left and right. The left kidney is associated with water, which nourishes the liver wood; this wood generates the heart fire. These three are in charge of blood, with the liver wood managing the blood on the left. The right kidney is associated with fire, which nurtures the spleen earth, and the earth generates lung metal. These three govern qi, with the lung metal managing the qi on the right. </p>
<p>Thus, when cold constricts, it causes the blood to weep; hence, the cold blood returns to the liver, accumulating in the left testicle. When qi is obstructed, it results in dampness accumulation; thus, the damp qi returns to the lungs, accumulating in the right testicle. Moreover, the tendons connecting to the testicles are not solely from the jueyin channel, but also involve the taiyin and yangming channels. </p>
<p>It is often observed that individuals suffering more in the left testicle experience more pain with less swelling, while those afflicted more in the right have less pain and more swelling, which can be clinically verified.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Suspended Carbuncle</h3>
<p>Suspended carbuncle occurs between the anterior and posterior yin, in the area of the perineum, specifically at the perineal acupoint. It belongs to the network of the Ren meridian and connects with the Du and Chong meridians. When a carbuncle develops in this location, it gives a feeling of suspension when one stands, hence the name &quot;suspended carbuncle.&quot;</p>
<h3>Bowel Poison</h3>
<p>According to &quot;Ghostly Inheritance&quot;: Bowel poison arises in the area beside the legs, underneath the tips of the buttocks, in front of the vagina and behind the urethra, forming a suspended carbuncle, all of which are extreme deficiencies. If it is close to the sides of the vagina, it is also known as hemorrhoidal carbuncle. It is advisable to urgently bolster the spleen and apply medicine at the site, specifically using hair acupoint powder; after rupture, apply pus-drawing ointment; when the pus is gone, use healing wound powder. Be cautious not to let it linger into winter, as it may become a cold leak, which is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Bowel poison develops in the area between the legs at the lower abdomen. Initially, there will be a mix of cold and heat with swelling and pain appearing between the legs. The kidneys are responsible for strength, holding the essence and wisdom; due to strong desires in both men and women that cannot be directly fulfilled, the essence deteriorates, merging with the blood and accumulating in the channels, forming bowel poison. This area is the pathway for the outflow of essence and energy. Sometimes, stimuli can trigger emotional responses; sometimes dreams linger without release, and when one fails to unite yin and yang, or cannot let go of emotions and thoughts, the essence and blood stagnate and lead to the formation of swellings and knots.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the onset, it is inappropriate to use cold and cooling medicines, for fear that qi and blood will become more stagnant and unable to circulate, ultimately leading to greater problems. Instead, one should open up stagnation and disperse qi, clearing away heat and toxins, so that vital essence and blood can flow freely, leading to natural recovery. </p>
<p>The previous discussion arises from boundless thoughts and unfulfilled wishes, yet the intent seems incomplete. If this reasoning holds true, many such ailments can be observed among monks, nuns, widows, and palace attendants, as well as among merchants and prostitutes who may inadvertently contract these diseases. Conditions like scabs or ulcers arise from fiery desires; once uncleanly engaged, the surge of lust opens the skin, allowing initial toxicity to enter. It is important to avoid purgatives at this stage. Why? The toxic evils do not enter if the system is not weak, and if stomach qi becomes weakened, the toxins will sink deeper, resulting in prolonged treatment without recovery. </p>
<p>The best approach is to induce sweating; next, promote urination, as pathogens affecting the skin tend to disperse easily. The penis and the inner thighs are closely linked to the liver meridian. The liver and kidneys govern the lower body, and the liver controls urination, allowing toxins to exit through the urine; thus, treatment aligns with natural processes. Consequently, results can be achieved within days. If sweating and urination have already been encouraged but the body remains heavy and the evils persist without release, then one should use remedies to break down toxins and invigorate blood flow, adjusting qi until the toxins are eliminated; subsequently, nourishing agents may be used, ensuring that the order of treatment is properly observed.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

As for the foot Taiyang, it connects externally to the clear water and internally belongs to the bladder, facilitating the water pathways; the hand Taiyang connects externally to the Huai water and internally pertains to the small intestine, from which the water pathways emerge, thereby also linking to the hand and foot Taiyang. The kidney is the master of water, thus also linking it to the foot Shaoyin. When drinking enters the stomach, it overflows with essence and energy, upward to the spleen. The spleen’s energy disperses essence, which rises to the lungs, regulating water pathways and downward to the bladder, thus again connecting to the hand Taiyin. The &quot;Suwen&quot; further states that the front genitals gather the essence of the muscles, where the Taiyin and Yangming meet, thus linking to the spleen and stomach.

<p><strong>Examination of Medical Formulas by Wu Kun in the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seven Types of Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Hernia is a concealed ailment with seven types, each having aspects of deficiency and excess. I have examined seven formulas, indicating the seven types of hernia. If there is a distinction between deficiency and excess, it relies on the adaptive changes in the individual. Cold hernia causes lower back pain, pulling the testicles, where they bend but do not extend, with a slow and deep pulse at the inner wrist; for this, the formula of Wu Zhu Yu with Fu Zi is prescribed. The seven hernias are: cold, water, tendon, blood, qi, fox, and (illness of decay). </p>
<p>The cause of cold hernia is external cold affecting the lower body, as if sitting in cold and wet conditions. Cold air enters from outside, constraining the lower fire and depressing liver energy, which leads to back pain. The pain pulling the testicles corresponds to the liver meridian connected to the genital area. Cold nature restricts, hence they bend but do not extend. The inner wrist governs below the waist, with a slow pulse indicating deficiency, confirming the presence of cold. Therefore, the warming qualities of Wu Zhu Yu and Fu Zi are used to address the cold, along with ginger and jujube which harmonize the qi. After the obstruction is removed, deficiency must be strengthened, thus ginseng is utilized to counteract the deficiency. </p>
<p>For water hernia, it is a condition of kidney cysts with persistent lower body sweating; for this, the formula to raise the yang and eliminate dampness is prescribed.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zi He said: Regarding water hernias, they are caused by drinking excessive water or liquor, and by exerting oneself internally, which aligns with reason. Drinking water and liquor leads to an excess of dampness, and exertion exhausts kidney energy. When kidney energy is weak, dampness prevails and causes flow issues, resulting in kidney cysts that swell like crystals and leak like a drip. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;What descends should be lifted.&quot; It also states: &quot;Wind can overcome dampness.&quot; </p>
<p>The formula includes Chai Hu, Qiang Huo, Cang Zhu, Fang Feng, Sheng Ma, Gao Ben, Man Jing Zi, and Du Huo, all of which are pungent in flavor and uplifting in nature. Thus, they can overcome dampness and elevate yang. Meanwhile, the sweet properties of Huang Qi can help support and lift the descending energy, the warmth of Gan Cao can help nurture the water-holding earth, and the moisturizing property of Dang Gui can help regulate the nourishing blood among the damp dispelling herbs. Wei Ling Decoction can also be used appropriately.</p>
<p>For external kidney damage leading to swelling of the testicles and occasional pain, there may be stagnant blood, known as blood hernia. It is advisable to use massage techniques, as detailed in guiding methods. </p>
<p>For muscle hernias, the main treatment is a decoction of Gan Cao and black beans. Muscle hernias manifest with pain in the tendons, causing bulging discomfort. Zi He stated that this results from improper methods. Improper methods refer to practices akin to springtime bedroom techniques. Therefore, treatment should focus on detoxification and relief, hence utilizing Gan Cao and black beans as the primary ingredients.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of qi hernia, when there is emotional distress, the testicles swell, but when in sorrow, they shrink without medication. The treatment is with Hu Qian Wan. This occurs because evil qi accumulates and often takes advantage of a deficiency. When emotional distress leads to swollen testicles, it is the liver qi taking over the deficiency of the kidneys. Sorrow that vanishes without treatment indicates a release of qi. The diseases of the liver and kidneys can be treated similarly, thus herbs like Zhi, Bai, Shu Di, Shao Yao, Niu Xi, Dang Gui, and Suo Yang, which have rich properties, can nourish both the kidneys and liver. The tortoise absorbs the thickest yin energy of heaven and earth, while the tiger draws the most potent yin energy; by combining yin elements found within the blood and qi, we aim for a mutual attraction. Dried tangerine peel is used for its ability to dispel stagnant qi, while lamb is chosen to nourish the yang of the five organs. If asked why we do not use the likes of tangerine seeds, trifoliate orange fruit, spicy finish, prickly ash seeds, or green skin, I would say these are all qi-breaking herbs. In the past, doctors frequently used them, but they only addressed the symptoms and ignored the warnings against further depleting a deficiency. Such herbs can be used for qi excess. </p>
<p>As for fox hernia, during the day, the qi escapes, causing the kidney to swell, which is unbearable. At night, the qi re-enters, and the swelling diminishes, leading to a sense of relief.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To supplement the center and benefit qi, use a formula containing Huangbo and Zhimu decoction. The treatment should cease once the illness is cured. The fox is known to emerge from its burrow to relieve itself during the day, and returns to its burrow without doing so at night. This demonstrates the phenomenon of the fox&#39;s hernia, hence it is named as such. Day represents yang; night represents yin. If there is illness during the day but not at night, it indicates a problem with qi, while blood remains unaffected. Therefore, ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, and licorice are used to benefit qi. If the formula also includes Shengma and Chaihu, it can elevate the sinking yang; if it has Huangbo and Zhimu, it can nourish the insufficient yin. Angelica has a spicy flavor, which can invigorate the stagnant blood; aged tangerine peel has a fragrant qi, which can help eliminate the staleness. Some may ask why we do not prioritize aromatic qi-moving agents. I would say: the initial cause of the illness is due to insufficient qi. To then treat it with qi-moving agents would not only be unhelpful but detrimental.</p>
<p>As for the (stomach) hernia, this is a chronic condition. Even if the testicles are large, there is no pain or suffering involved. This condition is inherited from parent to child and has existed since life began; it is not like an illness caused by the three postnatal factors, thus there is no need for treatment. If there was a prior (stomach) hernia that later developed pain and discomfort, then it involves the earlier six signs, and treatment should refer back to the earlier method.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Wind of the Kidney Cyst</strong></p>
<p>The wind of the kidney cyst is caused by wind and dampness from the liver meridian. It manifests as itching, with a tendency to be soothed by hot baths. In severe cases, it results in hard lumps that break open and ooze watery fluid. It is advisable to use a decoction of snake bed seeds for fumigation and washing; usually after two applications, it will recover.</p>
<p><strong>Crabs of the Groin</strong></p>
<p>Crabs of the groin, also known as eight-legged insects, arise from the turbid energies of both the liver and kidney meridians, representing an inauspicious condition. It is recommended to use Ginkgo leaf powder to adjust the affected area; internally, taking Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills, adding one tael of honey-fried Coptis to each pound, and five qian of aloe to clear the origins, ensures recovery without recurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Chancre</strong></p>
<p>Lower chancre is caused by the stagnation of lustful heat. There are three origins: First, due to the activation of desire in men, when the genital organs become aroused and lustful heat runs rampant without release, leading to the deterioration of seminal fluid and stagnant blood which then solidifies into a swelling. Second, from women where residual seminal fluid and turbid energies remain unclean after sexual intercourse, leading to the transmission of polluted essence. Third, from sexual practices involving heated medicines, applied to the genitals, stirring up yang fire and arousing yin essence—if the activity continues without release for a prolonged period, it often results in stagnation of heat and delayed eruption. </p>
<p>In men, early signs of manifested fire include frequent, painful urination, followed by the release of yellow, turbid fluid and gradual loss of vitality, leading to severe swelling, pain, and even corruption.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fish Mouth and Venom</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;fish mouth&quot; refers to the left side associated with the fish and the right side linked to venom. This condition arises when vital energies and blood intersect and become congested, forming swelling between the two hips. Near the lower abdomen, within the pubic hair, the swelling is termed as the “horizontal tumor” or “external hernia.” </p>
<p>This condition occurs when one resists the release of semen during intimacy, resulting in the suppression of vitality and a failure of release, which causes the vital energies and blood to become stagnant, clumping together to form a swelling. The treatment should aim to disperse the stagnation and promote the flow of both large and small intestines. Medicines such as Nine Dragon Dan and the inner essence of the pangolin are effective for dissipation. After seven days of use, the foundation becomes solid. </p>
<p>To prevent purulence, it is advisable to utilize fire needle therapy for puncturing, which is also effective. For cases where pus has already emerged, taking a comprehensive tonic is recommended to aid in consolidation; delaying treatment may result in the emergence of other complications that are harder to resolve.</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong><br>At the beginning, when swelling is not red, slightly warm, and there is mild ease of movement without signs of cold or heat, it is considered mild. Once developed, if it becomes red, swollen, painful, hot to the touch, and movement is difficult, particularly worsening at night, it is serious. If it has erupted, and the pus is thick, with flesh appearing red and vibrant, the swelling subsides and pain ceases, indicating a favorable recovery with the possibility of itchiness as new flesh forms.</p>
<p>Initially, the swelling feels as hard as stone, with sharp pain and discomfort when sitting, indicating severity with accompanying chills. If it has ruptured, and the flesh is necrotic with persistent pain, and the pus is clear and thin with a deep hole that does not seal, it is dangerous.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At first, there is a swelling and pain, tension in the hips, chills and fever; it is advisable to disperse the evil in the exterior. Once it has developed, it becomes hard and hot, with internal heat and pain, dryness of the mouth, and constipation; it is necessary to promote bowel movements. After dispersing and alleviating, if the swelling and pain persist, desiring it to form pus, one should use methods to detoxify. If the swelling and heat persist for a long time, causing extreme pain and urgent distension, and internal pus has formed, one should quickly drain it. After it has burst, if the pus does not dry up and new flesh grows slowly, one must nourish the spleen and stomach, and replenish qi and blood.</p>
<p>Regarding sac edema, it is caused by yin deficiency and damp-heat, flowing into the sac, resulting in swelling. After it ruptures, if the testicles hang, it should not cause harm, as the poison comes from outside. Treatment should be to tonify yin and clear damp-heat; efficacy is observed in 80-90% of cases. Recently, people have mistakenly used heat medications for hernias, leading to excessive heat and pus, making recovery difficult. It is advisable to start with Long Dan Cao (Gentian) decoction to clear liver heat, then after some time nourish yin and disperse; applying Ruyi Jin Huang powder externally may also help internally. </p>
<p>There is another type of water hernia, with shiny skin, no heat or redness, swollen and painful, and sometimes a hollow sac gathers water; one should use a needle to draw out the water from the appropriate area for relief. If the swelling and pain persist for a long time and internal pus has formed, one may quickly puncture it. Internally, one can take Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction) with additions like Shan Zhu Yu (Cornelian Cherry) and Mu Dan Pi (Peony) and Ze Xie (Alisma) for treatment, alternating with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia); this would also help in recovery.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

Once formed, it swells like a cucumber, with purple spots rotting, foul water but no pus, and if the pain is severe with a foul odor, it is difficult.

If, over time, there is internal pus formed but not ruptured and the swelling is painful, one should quickly use a needle; the method should favor tonification. After rupture, if the pus is clear and thin, with no retreat of virtual heat and persistent swelling and pain, it is advisable to nourish Yin and strengthen the spleen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Treatise on Diseases</strong><br><strong>by Yu Chang (Qing Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Hernia</strong>  </p>
<p>When treating edema, if there is a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and one rashly engages in outward therapies or attacks the interior, it can cause the patient to experience turbid qi rising to the chest and stomach, resulting in severe vomiting and rebellious qi, with pain radiating to the genitals. Such cases can lead to sudden death without rescue; it is the fault of the physician. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; abdominal pain with a tight, wiry pulse indicates that defensive qi is not circulating, leading to aversion to cold. A tight pulse signifies a lack of appetite. When the evil and the upright qi clash, it results in cold hernia. Cold hernia presents as pain around the navel; when it manifests, it results in spontaneous sweating and cold extremities. If the pulse is deep and wiry, apply a decoction of major aconite. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Neijing,&quot; any area in the abdomen where there is pain from a mass can be referred to as hernia, not limited to the area between the testicles. However, in the case of cold hernia with navel pain, the pulse shows a strong yang and a weak yin; the strong yang leads to an inability of defensive qi to circulate, resulting in aversion to cold, while the weak yin indicates that cold in the stomach is too potent to expel food. </p>
<p>The evil refers to the yin pathogen in the stomach, while the upright refers to the yang qi therein. This analysis involves both the essence of water and food in the stomach, as well as the noxious gas from these substances, and all are part of upright qi. If cold enters the nutritive aspect and clashes with the defensive aspect, then the nutritive aspect becomes the evil, while the defensive aspect remains the upright. </p>
<p>Pain around the navel, spontaneous sweating, and cold extremities, alongside a weak yang and strong yin, signal a critical condition. Therefore, using the warmth of aconite, combined with the sweetness of honey, to nourish the stomach strengthens the internal environment and alleviates the situation, allowing the yang within the defense to flourish and preventing the evil in the nutritive aspect from remaining. It also prevents the subtle threat of deficient cold rising from below.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Volume 200 of the Comprehensive Collection of Books on Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Yin Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jingyue&#39;s Complete Book</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jieben)</p>
<p><strong>Impotence of Male Organs</strong></p>
<p>For men with impotence and inability to maintain an erection, it often results from the decline of fire at the life gate, a deficiency of vital energy and coldness. This may also be due to excessive emotions and fatigue, which damage the vitality of yin, commonly leading to this condition. There are also cases where excessive damp-heat weakens the fundamental channels, resulting in impotence. Just as extreme heat can cause all things to wither, it is described in the classics that strong fire absorbs energy, which is indeed applicable here. However, whether there is fire or not can be differentiated by pulse and symptoms; indeed, the majority show deficiencies in fire, while only a few exhibit excess fire.</p>
<p>Excessive worry and labor, and too much melancholy, can also lead to impotence. The essence of yin and yang converges in the fundamental channels, with yang being the predominant force. These fundamental channels are the pathways of vital essence, and the essence is inherently the source of the channels. If excessive worry and thought oppress the heart and spleen, it affects the Yangming channel, inevitably leading to the depletion of food and energy, causing vital energy to become insufficient and thus the yang path will not be vigorous. The classics say: the disorders of the two yang affect the heart and spleen, leading to a lack of hidden vitality, such as with women missing their monthly cycle, which refers to this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, persistent shock and fear can also lead to impotence. The classics state that fear harms the kidneys, which is relevant here. Therefore, when one experiences a sudden fright, it can result in involuntary urination, demonstrating that the kidneys have been affected.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At times of旺盛阳气, if there is sudden fear, the yang path will become impotent; this is also a sign. When the fire of the life gate is weak, and there is deficiency of essence and coldness leading to impotence, it is advisable to use remedies like Right Return Pill, Zanyu Pill, or Stone-Carved Kidney-Calm Pill. If the fire is not greatly diminished and is simply due to weak blood and qi, then Left Return Pill, Dragon Spot Pill, or Whole Deer Pill should be used. </p>
<p>For those whose excessive thinking and fear have led to kidney depletion and impotence, it is essential to cultivate the heart and spleen to gradually nourish the stomach qi, so that circulation and the function of元阳 can be restored. Remedies like Seven Blessings Drink or Spleen Return Decoction are suitable. However, it is crucial to have a relaxed and open mind to ease the spirit, otherwise the medicinal effects will be of no benefit. For those excessively burdened by worry and fear, they often suppress the yang qi; if fire is not increased, there will be no vitality, and it is advisable to use Seven Blessings Drink with added cinnamon, aconite, or wolfberry.</p>
<p>If there is damp heat in the liver and kidneys causing relaxation of the meridians, this too results in impotence. Treatment should focus on clearing fire to strengthen the kidneys, but it is necessary to have fire symptoms that internally and externally correspond to this condition. Remedies like Nourishing Yin Eight Flavor Pill, or Danxi Great Nourishing Yin Pill, and Tiger Crouch Pill are suitable. If there is excessive fire, Nourishing Kidney Pill or Great Nourishing Pill can also be used.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Hernia</strong></p>
<p>Hernia refers to conditions where the lower abdomen or testicles are swollen or painful at any time. However, the symptoms of hernia vary. For example, as mentioned in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the fox hernia is characterized by irregularity in its appearance; the stubborn hernia is marked by persistent swelling and lack of sensation; the upward hernia is characterized by pain radiating from the lower abdomen upwards; the obstructive hernia is due to stagnant energy in the public region causing reversals; the painful hernia involves heat in the lower abdomen with symptoms of white discharge, also known as &quot;gu&quot;; and the wind hernia according to seasonal theories is also included. There’s also the intestinal hernia discussed in relation to pathogenic influences on organs. All these seven conditions represent different aspects of hernia. Furthermore, hernia is not only a male affliction; women also suffer from it. The text mentions that stagnant energy in the abdomen can lead to what is called obstructive hernia, applicable to women as well. It is also discussed that the term &quot;obliterated&quot; in relation to the obstructive hernia refers to swelling in the lower abdomen of women.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for conditions like hernias and lumps, they affect both men and women alike. However, diseases of the testicles are exclusively male, and all others should be carefully examined. Looking at Zhang Zi&#39;s words: involuntary urination, urinary obstruction, impotence, and seminal discharge are ailments of men. If blood is stagnant and there are monthly issues, heat in the lower back and knees, leg weakness, dry throat, urinary obstruction, and masses in the lower abdomen, or if there are protrusions in the front or hemorrhoids in the back, these pertain to women. Women do not refer to hernias as &quot;seven hernias,&quot; but rather as lumps. If a young person develops these issues, whether man or woman, they may remain childless. This is indeed not incorrect. However, people today only speak of hernias in men and are entirely unaware of those in women, which is a significant oversight. </p>
<p>Hernial conditions do not belong to a single principle. As stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: the Ren meridian is associated with illness, where men can develop seven hernias, and women may experience discharge and lumps. The Du meridian causes pain from the lower abdomen to the heart, manifesting as a hernia that cannot advance or retreat, which is termed &#39;冲疝&#39; (chong hernia).<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: the spleen transmits to the kidney, and the illness is called hernia. It is further stated: the three yang manifest as cold and heat, which transmits as hernia. It is said: if the evil resides in the small intestine, it connects to the testicular system and belongs to the spine. Furthermore, if the evil lodges in the meridian of the foot&#39;s jueyin, it causes sudden sharp pain from hernia. Likewise, the pulses of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys each have their distinctions regarding hernia. This is mentioned in the &quot;Suwen,&quot; discussing hernia of various meridians. Other texts, such as the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; discuss the leg&#39;s yangming sinews, with the illness manifesting as severe abdominal pain from hernia; the leg&#39;s taiyin sinews present with pain in the yin organs, extending down to the navel, with pain in both sides; the leg&#39;s jueyin sinews result in dysfunction of the yin organs, among other such meanings, which is articulated in the &quot;Lingshu&quot; regarding hernia of the meridians. From Zhang Zihe, it is stated: there are seven types of hernia. Many earlier scholars have discussed this. I do not accept views that are not from the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; &quot;Suwen,&quot; or &quot;Tongren.&quot; I cite the discussion from the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; stating: the sinews of the foot&#39;s jueyin converge at the yin organs, hence the sinews of yangming and taiyin all converge at the yin organs.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The liver governs the tendons, and therefore, for conditions like hernia, one must consider it to be related to the liver. This view holds that hernia is a tendon disease, and since tendons are governed by the liver, it seems reasonable to conclude that hernia must originate in the liver. However, this is not entirely correct. Observing the various discussions in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; those views are not attributed to the &quot;Ling&quot; or &quot;Su,&quot; and should they be dismissed entirely? Moreover, although tendons are governed by the liver, they are mentioned throughout the classics, thus forming part of the classical understanding. If a disease presents in various meridians, can it truly be attributed solely to tendons? Furthermore, as discussed in the texts, the front yin is where tendons converge, uniting the Taiyin and Yangming. Additionally, the discussion on atrophy state mentions that yin and yang fundamentally meet at the tendons, with Yangming being predominant. Can such statements also be ignored? Therefore, considering the meridians in the lower abdomen, they involve the Jueyin, Shaoyin, Taiyin, Yangming, Shaoyang, and Taiyang, as well as the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians, all of which are engaged. Now, if we examine the treatments for hernia in the &quot;Copper Man Classic,&quot; each of the meridians has acupoints assigned for treatment. If one argues that treatment pertains only to the Jueyin, then all other meridians would be deemed irrelevant.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zihe also pointed out the acupoints in the various channels, stating that although these points can treat hernias, they are ultimately not the places where hernias arise. What does this mean? Later, Danxi followed Zihe’s words and claimed that there are seven types of hernias: cold, water, tendon, blood, qi, fox, and (decay of the sick). He asserted that they primarily belong to the liver channel and have no connection to the kidney channel. Furthermore, Dai Yuanli, influenced by Danxi, said hernias belong to the liver of the Jueyin channel. I have often seen popular beliefs that the gas of the lower parts of the small intestine and bladder are mere nonsense. Alas! Such discussions are mere speculations by later scholars; can they truly be trusted? Can they validly serve as a guide? The medical profession has lost its true teachings, and many share this fate. Therefore, unless it is the words from &quot;Ling,&quot; &quot;Su,&quot; or &quot;Bronze Man,&quot; I sincerely do not dare to take them as authoritative.</p>
<p>The illness of hernia qi can present both cold and heat symptoms. Yet it must stem from an initial exposure to cold and dampness or from encountering cold substances, leading to the accumulation of pathogenic factors in the yin areas. This is the root cause, as there is none that arises without being related to cold and dampness. Once the illness persists, there are those whose stagnant condition transforms into heat.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some people with excess yang in their organs may suffer from the gathering of fire due to pathology, which is accompanied by damp heat. Therefore, in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; both cold and heat are discussed regarding hernias. For instance, it states: when the illness is in the lower abdomen, with abdominal pain and inability to pass urine or stool, it is called hernia, caused by cold; it also mentions that when yin is excessive and the pulse is distended and obstructed, it is referred to as hernia due to (the grip of) the illness; it is said that liver and spleen may be affected by cold dampness, treated in the same way as hernia; it notes that when the Yangming, Taiyang, and Taiyin are overstimulated, there may be hernia, which all points to the cold aspect of hernias. Furthermore, when it mentions that spleen wind transmits to the kidney, it is termed hernia and mass, with lower abdomen heat and pain, producing white discharge, also called &quot;gu&quot;; when it refers to the foot&#39;s Jueyin channels, if the yin organs fail to function, being injured by cold causes the yin to contract, while injury from heat results in excess expansion and lack of control, both pertain to the heat aspect of hernias. This shows that the &quot;Neijing&quot; does not neglect either cold or heat. Observing Danxi, it states: since the &quot;Suwen,&quot; everything has been considered cold, as cold governs contraction. If the meridians are affected by cold, they draw in and do not flow, leading to pain.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, there are those who can kick ice and wade through water but remain free from illness for a lifetime, due to the absence of heat within. Generally, this condition arises from damp-heat in the channels, becoming stagnant over time, and then being constrained by external cold, preventing dispersion, which causes pain. If it were solely caused by cold, it might not lead to a complete condition. This is what Danxi argues. Therefore, treatments often focus on fire, with an increased use of herbs like gardenia and berberine. I cannot refrain from commenting on this. Observing the Inner Canon’s discussion on hernias, it is clear that it is not merely a matter of cold; while there is often more mention of cold than heat, this is also a fundamental principle of hernia treatment that cannot be changed. Moreover, hernias are caused by the invasion of cold evil into the channels, resulting in pain, and only after a long duration can it turn into stagnation and heat. If the condition initially does not suffer from cold, how could a hernia develop? Here, cold is the root cause and heat is the superficial manifestation.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one argues that the onset of damp heat stems from internal channels and is compounded by external pathogens causing pain, then it would mean that heat is the root cause while cold is merely a superficial symptom. Is this truly the case? As for those who kick ice or wade in water and remain healthy for a lifetime, despite distinctions of wealth and duration, it is evident that some possess a strong internal yang that cold cannot invade. If one claims that there is no internal heat, thus cold cannot penetrate, is that also accurate? The causes of illness must be discerned. Therefore, when discussing the principles in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which are precise and appropriate, how could they be disregarded? In later generations, common discussions are often overly biased and flawed; how can we uncritically accept them? </p>
<p>Moreover, in treating such conditions, one cannot hastily assume it is solely due to cold or solely due to heat. One must primarily address the initial invading pathogen by warming the channels, dispersing cold, regulating qi, and eliminating dampness. It is imperative not to apply cold or cooling methods too early, as this could leave lingering pathogenic influences, leading to significant harm. Over time, there are cases that begin with cold, others where heat arises from stagnant cold, and some where the original yang is injured, causing increasing weakness. </p>
<p>It is essential to examine the patient’s symptoms and the cause of their illness, and to adapt the treatment accordingly. If indeed there are signs of heat, obvious pulses, or visible symptoms, then it is appropriate to treat with cooling methods. However, if heat signs are not present, yet one insists that hernias are generally due to damp heat, this leads to some individuals developing conditions while others worsen. This is a common fallacy in practice that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>On Treatment</p>
<p>In treating hernias, one must investigate their causes. Although they may result from exposure to cold or dampness, they can also stem from desires, overexertion, anger, or from drinking and eating moist substances without caution, leading to cold evils entering the body. This causes the yin to seek yin, resulting in a blockage in the sea of blood and energy, ultimately descending to the lower yin section, resulting in various hernias. Therefore, regarding symptoms: some manifest after encountering cold; some develop heat after prolonged stagnation; some appear with qi counterflow due to pent-up anger; some arise from dampness causing cold stagnation; some are caused by extreme fatigue leading to injury; some occur when deficiency evils affect the lesser yin and greater yin related to desires; and some result from moisture from food and drink in the yangming and taiyin after consuming wine or rich foods. Over time, the righteous qi becomes trapped and cannot rise, while the evil qi lingers and does not dissipate, leading to chronic conditions that are difficult to heal. Thus, in treating hernias, one must precisely determine their origins and treat accordingly for successful outcomes. If one is confused and blindly adheres to partial views, failing to gain insight even into old age, discussions will ultimately be of no benefit. Therefore, in treating hernias, it is essential first to treat the qi, hence the name &quot;hernia qi&quot; is not without reason.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is cold qi accompanying coldness, heat qi with heat, damp Qi with dampness, and contrary qi with opposition. When qi is in the yang aspect, it manifests as the qi within the qi; when in the yin aspect, it manifests as the qi within the blood. For excessive qi, one must disperse it; for deficient qi, one must replenish it. Therefore, in the treatment of hernias, one must use qi-regulating medicines alongside other treatments. If hernia pain is sudden and severe, it is due to qi counteracting, thus one should first use the Li Xiang San; for excessive stagnation of qi, one should use Baojian Chuanlian San or Tiantai Wuyao San. If there is no substantial pathogen but cold prevails, a warming liver decoction should be the primary remedy.</p>
<p>Cold hernias are particularly painful and often caused by exposure to cold pathogens or consumption of cold foods. Symptoms include a preference for warmth, aversion to cold, thin and wiry pulse, cold extremities, and lack of warmth in urine and stool. For mild cold conditions, one should use Li Xiang San, Warming Liver Decoction, Shenqi Wan, Shenying San, or Dingxiang Lian Shi Wan. For severe cold conditions, one should use Yilin Sishen Wan, Shijiu Xuanfang Debu Wan, Hulu Ba Wan, or Chenxiang Gui Fu Wan. One method is to take Wujisan with salt-fried Wu Zhu Yu and Xiao Hui Xiang, each one qian, along with five slices of ginger and five inches of green onion, decocted and taken on an empty stomach in hot form, which greatly mitigates unbearable qi pain.</p>

<p>In cases where the kidney is not deficient but the liver channel has excessive damp-heat and fire, causing pain in the stem, tightness of the sinews, pain or itchiness, swelling or protrusion that does not retract, and white discharge like seminal fluid following urination, this is termed &quot;sinew hernia.&quot; The treatment should be the Longdan Qinggan Decoction.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one observes that it is neither a matter of qi nor food, the lower abdomen is distended and palpable, and the stool is dark and constipated, while urination is smooth, there must be blood accumulation or forms of blood-related hernias. In such cases, one should use peach kernel paste, or peach kernel decoction, or similar herbal formulas for purging.</p>
<p>When a hernia occurs in conjunction with sexual desire, it is surely a sign of kidney yin deficiency. If there is kidney yin deficiency along with rising fire, one should use the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction with additions like Huangbo, Zhimu, Shanzhizi, Fennel, and Chuanlian. If it is kidney yin deficiency without fire, or if it includes cold with pain in the essence, one should use the Nourishing Yin Decoction or the Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction with Fennel and Goji berries, or take the Warm Liver Decoction.</p>
<p>Chronic hernias are always linked to more deficiency patterns. This may be due to a pre-existing weakness in the original qi, or to a lack of endurance where slight exertion triggers symptoms. One should differentiate based on pulse and symptoms. In treating deficient hernias, one must assess whether the deficiency is in the yin or yang aspect. For yin deficiency, mild cases may be treated with Warm Liver Decoction or Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Decoction; severe cases may require the Nourishing Yin Decoction and perhaps formulas for tonifying yin and benefitting qi. If it is a case of yang deficiency, one should use Warm Stomach Drink, Gui Pi Decoction, or the Benefit Middle and Increase Qi Decoction. If yang deficiency is severe, one must include ingredients like Cinnamon, Aconite, Pepper, and Ginger, or employ the Six-Flavor Return Yang Drink.</p>
<p>If there is a combination of deficiency and stagnation, one should primarily follow the previous treatment principle and add medications for guiding and dispersing, such as Chuanlianzi, Fennel, Zhi Shi, Hawthorn, and Gardenia, using them appropriately as adjuncts.</p>
<p>For hernias with pathogenic excess that need to be purged, refer to the discussions in Zhang Zihe&#39;s writings.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the treatment of hernias by Zihe, although there are various methods, they all primarily involve purging. Therefore, it cannot be devoid of bias. Liu Zonghou and Xu Yongcheng expressed doubts about this method, suggesting it might be excessive, but they did not say it should be completely disregarded. Examining Danxi&#39;s approach, he stated that treating hernias should not involve purging—this is indeed a stark contradiction.</p>
<p>I examined Zihe’s treatment cases, such as the case of Cai Canjun, who suffered from severe hernia pain after sitting on wet ground. He was treated with Water-Guide Pills and recovered. Another patient had a hernia due to excessive drinking caused by a fever; the physician administered ginger and prepared medicinal wine, which caused dryness and heat to constrict his condition, leading to a heavy, swollen scrotum. It was only after treating him with Water-Guide Pills followed by Pigskin Powder that he recovered. There was also a man who suddenly developed a hernia, which was red, swollen, and excruciating, persisting for several days. Various medicines were ineffective, likened to stones thrown into water. Eventually, he was treated with Water-Guide Pills and then Tongjing Powder, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In such cases, can we truly say purging is completely inappropriate? Therefore, it is essential to consider the specifics of deficiency and urgency. If there is obstruction from excessive heat, or if it is a young person suffering from a sudden illness, or if there is extreme swelling and pain, then medications such as Water-Guide Pills, Three-Hua Divine Aid Pills, and Yugong Powder should be used. When the evil is rampant and urgent, and cannot be alleviated by milder remedies that regulate qi or promote diuresis, more aggressive treatment becomes necessary. This method of Zihe is also one that must not be abandoned; it requires careful consideration.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

<p>For the treatment of this condition, if there is swelling and pain with internal and external ulceration, it is best to use a decoction of peony and thistle, or a modified Si Wu Decoction with gardenia, moutan root, gentian, and schisandra. Alternatively, a modified Xiao Yao San may be used. If there is dampness and itching, a decoction of peony and thistle or Gui Pi Decoction with encouraging herbs, gardenia, and moutan root is recommended. In the case of painful urination with a thick discharge, Long Dan Decoction for clearing the liver should be taken with white atractylodes and moutan root added. If there is profuse discharge and severe pain and swelling due to excessive heat, Da Fen Qing Yin or Chou Xin Yin should be utilized. For swelling with toxic buildup, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction should be taken with gardenia and moutan root added. For cases that can be washed, a hundred herb decoction should be used. For those that can be applied externally, Piao Xiao San or Wan Chuang San is recommended.</p>
<h3>Lower Sores</h3>
<p>Lower sores are essentially a condition of liver and kidney damp-heat. If there is no external cause for the illness, it suffices to clear the damp-heat or nourish the true yin. Once the damp-heat is cleared, the sores will heal on their own, and there will be no need for excessive worry. However, if one is affected by toxic forces, depending on the depth of the poison, the severity of the illness varies, and it is advisable to use a hundred herb wash treatment, applying Piao Xiao San externally; lighter cases will resolve themselves. If the damp-heat is severe and causes swelling and pain, a decoction of peony and thistle should be administered to treat both aspects. If the toxicity is intense, Bi Xie Decoction can also be used. If one is affected by evil influences and the poison penetrates directly into the essence palace, recovery is not easy; treatment should follow the aforementioned methods. However, if no visible poison shows itself and a broad sore appears, then only after the lower sores begin to heal will the treatment follow as mentioned under the respective section.

<p>In the initial stage of swelling and pain, when pus has not yet formed and the vital energy remains strong, it is crucial to eliminate the poison quickly. The best remedies are either Hui Pung San or Mu Li San. If pus has already formed, it may be addressed by puncturing or cauterizing; the key is to remove the pus swiftly and adjust treatment according to the resulting symptoms for quick healing.</p>
<p>If a lump first appears with mild pain and swelling, there are two indications: one is a light邪 (pathogenic factor), and the other is weak vital energy with deep toxicity. For a light邪, using Hui Tong Gao with musk as a plaster will ensure dispersal; alternatively, Jiang Ying San can also be used. If the vital energy is weak and the toxicity deep, it neither disperses nor ruptures early, and the longer it persists, the worse it becomes, making it particularly feared. After it ruptures, it often cannot heal; the mild case may result in a fistula, and the severe may lead to death. Therefore, substantial replenishment of vital energy is essential to avoid harm.</p>

<p><strong>The Strong Yang Does Not Fall</strong>  </p>
<p>The strong yang does not fall; this is due to the excess fire rising up, preventing the lung&#39;s metal energy from descending. If one uses a decoction of huangbo (phelodendron) and zhimu (anemarrhena), it will immediately disperse. However, if it falls afterward, persisting for a whole year and beyond without recovery, it becomes a source of suffering. The formula should include three taels of yuanshen (radix polygalae) and maidong (ophiopogon), along with three fen of rougui (cinnamon), boiled in water for consumption to restore balance. This formula is effective because yuanshen helps to drain the floating fire from the kidneys; especially, the three fen of rougui draws it inward, inviting the excessive fire back into balance, as they seek each other in harmony. Moreover, maidong further assists the lung&#39;s metal energy in descending to generate kidney water; when there is sufficient water, the fire will naturally cease.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　至于痿而不振者，乃过于琢削，日泄其肾中之水，而肾中之火，亦日消亡。盖水去而火亦去，必然之理。如一家人口，厨下无水，又何以煮爨而生烟？必汲其泉源，而后取其薪炭，可以钻燧取火，以煮饮食，否则空铛安爨也。方用熟地一两，山茱萸四钱，远志、巴戟天、杜仲、肉苁蓉各一钱，人参、枸杞子各三钱，茯神、肉桂各二钱，白朮五钱，水煎服，一剂起，二剂强，三剂妙。老人倍加。此方用热药于补水之中，则火起而不愁炎烧之祸，自然煮汤可饮，煮米可餐，断不致焦釜沸干，或虞爆碎也。　　阳倒不举，方用熟地一斤，黄芪二斤，巴戟天、当归各六两，肉桂、柏子仁去油，覆盆子、麦冬各三两，白朮八两，各为末，蜜为丸，每日白滚汤送下一两，自然阳旺不倒矣。<a id="orig-149p" href="#trans-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Weak Yang and Lack of Vitality</strong></p>
<p>When there is weakness and lack of vitality, it stems from excessive refinement, which leads to the daily depletion of the water in the kidneys, while the fire in the kidneys also gradually diminishes. Indeed, when water leaves, fire must also leave; this is a necessary principle. For example, if a household has no water in the kitchen, how can they cook and create smoke? One must first draw water from the source before gathering firewood; only then can fire be ignited to cook food. Otherwise, the pot remains empty and unheated. </p>
<p>One should use one tael of cooked rehmannia, four qian of cornelian cherry, one qian each of polygala root, morinda root, eucommia bark, and cistanche, three qian each of ginseng and goji berries, two qian each of poria and cinnamon, and five qian of white atractylodes, boiled in water. One dose rises, two doses strengthen, and three doses are wonderful. For elderly individuals, the dosage should be increased. This method uses warm herbs to replenish water; thus, fire rises without concern for burning calamities, naturally allowing for broth to be consumed and rice to be cooked, preventing the pot from burning dry or risking explosions.</p>
<p>For Yang that is completely down, use one jin of cooked rehmannia, two jin of astragalus, six liang each of morinda root and Angelica, and three liang each of cinnamon and biota seed (washed of oil), as well as raspberry and ophiopogon, and eight liang of white atractylodes, all ground into powder and formed into pills with honey. Take one tael daily with boiling broth, and naturally, the Yang will thrive and not falter.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Fox Hernia</p>
<p>In the treatment of men and women, there is fundamentally no difference, yet there are unique aspects. The difference in conditions between men and women lies in hernias, where men may experience strong yang but still suffer from impotence. However, concerning hernias, the only distinction for women is the fox hernia; all others are the same. The fox hernia retracts during the day above the pouch and hangs down at night below the pouch. This condition arises from cold and dampness, along with the improper influences of yin and yang, occurring at the moment of interaction, or along the pathways of spirit or during damp conditions. </p>
<p>For treatment, use five qian of wormwood, pound it to extract the juice, wash it with cold water, take one bowl of the juice, add one liang of sand ginseng, and one qian each of cassia, cinnamon twig, fennel, and tangerine kernel. Boil in water and consume. One dose will allow it to extend, two doses will reduce it, and three doses will achieve complete recovery.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

If there is prolonged neglect of marital matters, constipation, fever, and burning pain, or strong engagement of vital energy, leading to complicated blood intertwining, swelling, pain, and constipation, it is advisable to use this remedy. Conversely, for individuals who are fatigued without significant swelling, having regular bowel habits, or exhibiting reddish and hot urine without purulence, and those whose wounds do not heal, it is better to use the Ten-Ingredient Great Tonifying Decoction. This condition often arises from insufficient labor or excessive sexual activity, leading to depletion of vital energy.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one can greatly tonify the qi and blood, recovery can occur in a few days—why then require a hundred days? The healing of wounds depends on the abundance of qi and blood. I once treated a scholar named Ling Daizhi who suffered from deficiency and took harmful medications, nearly resulting in a critical state. I prescribed a remedy to strengthen his spleen, and he recovered. Scholar Wang Wenyuan suffered from labor and ailments, took Xiao Chaihu Decoction, which resolved exterior symptoms, and later used my remedy to drain and treated the abscess, recovering in several days. Judge Hu had clear pus and weak veins; he only used tonifying medicine and was healed. However, after recently marrying, he relapsed and self-administered a detoxifying decoction, leading to uncontrolled diarrhea and ultimately death. This illustrates that such conditions are often due to insufficiency and must be tonified. Generally, pustules belong to the liver meridian; initially, they are firm and hard due to the liver&#39;s dominance over the tendons. After five to seven days, they should become red and soft with pus; if still hard, it indicates deficiency of the original qi, unable to decompose. Often, people see hardness and only want to remove it internally, inadvertently taking aggressive herbs that lead to further deficiency. The previously mentioned cases are examples of this issue. </p>

The outer kidney becomes swollen and hard like stone, growing larger, due to frequent intake of hot medicinal herbs or improper handling. The remedy warms and guides yang qi, gradually dispelling cold evils, tonifying deficiencies, reducing hernias, and nourishing the kidney meridian, enabling restoration.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Complete Deer Pill nourishes Yang, replenishes deficiencies, and its benefits cannot be fully described. If a person takes one dose, it can extend life by a decade. The preparation must be shared by four people who each consume a portion of one deer. After a year, they prepare it again together, and after four years, each person will have one complete deer. If one person prepares a dose alone, it risks spoiling over time and losing its medicinal potency.</p>
<p>To make it, take a deer, kill it, remove the hair, wash out the internal organs, and cook the deer meat with wine until done. Cut the meat into strips and dry it to a powder. Take the skin, mix it, and boil it with the original broth to form a paste. Combine this paste with the meat powder and honey to form pills. Its bones should be roasted and powdered, then mixed with ginseng, white atractylodes, poria, honey-fried licorice, angelica, ligusticum, raw and cooked rehmannia, honey-fried astragalus, asparagus, wheat, goji berries, eucommia treated with salty water, prepared ox knee with wine, yam, water chestnut, dodder seed, morinda, schisandra, cistanche mixed with wine, prepared lotus root with wine, and raspberry treated with wine, along with autumn stones, ligusticum, and dried tangerine peel, each one tael.</p>
<p>First, the medicinal ingredients must be finely powdered and mixed thoroughly. Once the deer glue is ready, combine it with the mixture to form pills the size of apricot seeds, then dry them. Use raw yellow silk to make fifty small bags, each capable of holding about one pound, and hang them in a well-ventilated place. After consuming one bag, take another. On damp days, it is advisable to warm them over a fire a couple of times. Each dose is eight to ninety pills, taken on an empty stomach before bedtime, washed down with ginger soup, salt soup, clear soup, or warm wine in winter is also acceptable.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Bai Cao Jian (Hundred Herbs Decoction) treats various types of carbuncles and toxins, wounds, painful rotten flesh, swelling, and conditions caused by wind, cold, and dampness. It has remarkable effects on all such ailments. </p>
<p>The herbs gathered from fields and mountains can be used indiscriminately, although mountain herbs are preferred, particularly those that are aromatic and pungent. In winter, dried herbs may be used, but they must be harvested in advance. </p>
<p>Regardless of quantity, prepare a concentrated decoction by boiling it down, and while hot, use it to steam and wash the affected area, applying it with a cloth. After a considerable time, ensure that the medicinal vapor thoroughly penetrates, and then apply other medicines. This should be done two to three times daily as often as possible. </p>
<p>The cooling properties of certain herbs can dispel heat, while warming ones can disperse cold. Aromatic herbs can promote the flow of qi, and detoxifying ones can eliminate toxins. Every herb has its use and benefit. When the decoction captures the properties of the herbs, its vapor becomes harmless; when the herbs absorb the vapor, their power is enhanced. </p>
<p>The principle of using various herbs to create a decoction follows this reasoning. This method is indeed one of the most essential and effective in surgery, also shared with those outside the medical profession.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: When there is low back pain, one cannot turn or shake; urgently needling the Yin and egg points, the eight hui points should be needled alongside the pain. The eight hui points are located between the waist and buttocks. When there is disease in the lower abdomen with abdominal pain, preventing bowel movements, the condition is called hernia, caused by cold. Needle between the lower abdomen and thighs, and between the ankle bone and the waist. Needling should be thorough to promote healing; with needling, the illness is resolved. </p>
<p>The Du meridian begins from the center of the bones below the lower abdomen. In women, it connects to the uterus cavity, which is situated at the end of the urinary opening; it transmits to the yin organs, encircles the coccyx, separates and connects to the perineium, and merges with the major yang energy in the body, linking to the lesser yin on the inner side of the thigh and penetrating the spine to associate with the kidneys. For men, it follows the penis down to the perineum, similar to women. When illness arises and rushes from the lower abdomen up to the heart causing pain, preventing forward and backward movement, it is called &quot;chong hernia.&quot; Women may experience infertility, urinary retention, incontinence, and dry throat. Illness in the Du meridian is treated along the Du meridian itself, preferably at the bones, and in severe cases, below the navel. </p>
<p>Evil influences affecting the foot&#39;s jueyin meridian can cause sudden severe pain from hernia. Needle the area where the big toe&#39;s nail and flesh meet, for both men and women. Treat the left for the right, and the right for the left. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says: The pain in the muscles of the foot&#39;s taiyin meridian is associated with the pain of the yin organs, pulling down to the sides of the abdomen, treated with fire needles and points, using the pain as a guide for method. </p>
<p>The small intestine controls the testicles, pulling the spine upward to the heart, where evil resides in the small intestine, connecting to the testicular cords, relating to the spine, penetrating the liver and lung, and linking to the heart cord.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a></p></div>

Moxibustion with one hundred cups is effective. For the seven types of hernia, take half a pound of salt, fry it until extremely hot, and use a cloth bag to apply it to the painful area. The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; says that for hernia, place moxa sticks on either side of the hernia or in a vertical cross pattern, and perform moxibustion seven times. The &quot;Dongyuan Shishu&quot; mentions that for sudden hernia pain, you should puncture the foot&#39;s Jueyin point. The &quot;Qixiao Liangfang&quot; describes Zhang Zhongwen&#39;s miraculous moxibustion method for heavy pain in the lower back and knees, where turning or sitting is difficult, and for cold cramps in the legs that make bending and stretching impossible. Moxibustion is applied at the knee on both sides and at the four locations of the feet, three times each. Each moxibustion on a foot involves two flames being applied until the moxa ignites on the flesh. Initially, there is pain; having two people blowing on both sides helps until the fire is extinguished. This should be done at noon. Once the person is settled, the organs may spontaneously shift or move with a rumbling sound, leading to immediate recovery. This method is remarkably effective and cannot be overestimated. The &quot;Yixue Gangmu&quot; states that in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; there are four methods for treating lower abdominal pain with acupuncture and moxibustion, the first concerning the liver meridian.<a id="trans-295p" href="#orig-295p" class="marker">[295p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those suffering from bladder disease, the lower abdomen is swollen and painful on one side; pressing it with the hand causes the urge to urinate but fails to produce urine.

<p>Next is the discussion on the governing, conception, and chong channels.

The first method is what this article refers to as &#39;using a jade stone to extract liquid from the scrotum.&#39; This is a method that many in the present day can also perform. When the scrotum is as large as a doudou, it contains impure liquid, which can be several liters, thus confirming this method is from ancient practices.</p>
<p>The second method involves treating the liver. The text states: &#39;The channel of the foot Jueyin affects hernia in men and abdominal swelling in women.&#39; Therefore, for the foot Jueyin liver channel, assess the condition of excess or deficiency as well as heat or cold; administer treatments accordingly with tonification or dispersal, and leave moxibustion for illness.</p>
<p>The third method targets the collateral of the liver. The text states: &#39;The branch of the foot Jueyin is called Ligou, located five inches above the inner ankle, diverging to the Shaoyang.&#39; The path of this branch runs along the shin and converges near the genital area; when symptoms are characterized by counterflow of pathogenic Qi, the scrotum may swell and hernia becomes apparent. Therefore, five inches above the inner ankle, apply on the area close to the bone at the back of the shin—this is where Ligou is used.</p>
<p>The fourth method uses the muscle of the foot Yangming. The text states: &#39;The muscle of the foot Yangming gathers in the upper abdomen near the genitals; symptoms include cramping, swelling in the thigh, and intense abdominal pain.&#39; Treatment involves using fire needles to prick at the painful areas, determining the number based on pain response. Apply fire needle at the site of cramping pain.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidance for Hernia Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: For treating hernia, sit comfortably with your legs extended. Use both hands to grasp the thumbs, pulling the feet toward the head to support the lower body. Hold the breath for five counts, drawing energy from the abdomen to circulate through the body, alleviating hernia and related ailments, benefiting the orifices, making movement easy. Practice this regularly to gain clarity and lengthen insight.</p>
<p>One method involves rubbing the hands together 100 to 200 times until they become warm, then gently pressing the scrotum until the discomfort dissipates.</p>
<p>The &quot;Examination of Medical Formulas&quot; mentions that an external injury to the kidneys may lead to swelling in the testicles and occasional pain, which can be due to stagnant blood, termed “blood hernia.” It is advisable to support the area with one hand beneath and press with the other, increasing pressure gradually. Repeat this several times. Over a month, stagnant blood will disperse, and old qi will circulate; it is indeed a marvelous technique. Even chronic conditions can be cured over time.</p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; explains that for small intestine hernia, apply pressure on the lower abdomen while taking several breaths, tightly closing the area to see immediate effects.</p>
<p>In terms of energy manipulation, if there is an accumulation of heat in the body and the external kidneys are affected by cold, it can cause swelling and pain, which is hard to describe. Focus on drawing energy from the external kidneys to the internal kidneys, performing this for a total of fourteen cycles. Then visualize a flame within the internal kidneys and guide it upwards to the crown, briefly concentrating before practicing blowing and inhaling techniques.</p>
<p>For external treatment, apply capsicum sachets to disperse the cold; after warming the area, proceed with elevating techniques.<a id="trans-301p" href="#orig-301p" class="marker">[301p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Medical Record</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states: Duke Cheng of Anling in Banli was stricken with an illness. I examined the pulse and concluded it was a type of hernia. This hernia is located beneath the diaphragm and connects to the lungs, resulting from an internal condition. My advice is to avoid strenuous activities. Engaging in such activities would surely lead to vomiting blood and death. Upon further examination, I indicated that the patient was unlikely to survive until morning; they were destined to die. This condition arises internally. Hence, I recognized that the patient would show signs of a pulse related to Fan Yang, which indicates a void within them. The prognosis is fatal. The cycle of life and death is intertwined with this hernia. I also noted that other diagnoses could determine survival and that numerous illnesses have been treated over time, making it difficult for me to recall or provide a complete diagnosis. I do not dare to respond with certainty.<a id="trans-302p" href="#orig-302p" class="marker">[302p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The wife of the Minister of State from Qi&#39;s Northern Palace fell ill. All the doctors believed it to be an invasion of wind causing an illness in the middle, affecting the lungs, and they treated her by needling the Lesser Yang meridian in her feet. I, however, diagnosed her pulse and concluded: the pathological condition was a dampness obstructing the bladder, causing difficulty both in urination and defecation, with urine appearing red. When exposed to cold, it led to involuntary urination, resulting in abdominal swelling. Due to the illness, when she felt the need to urinate, she could not. This blockage was due to the disease. Hence, I discerned that those who were ill had strong and solid pulses, but their arrival was difficult, indicating the movement of the Jueyin. A difficult pulse indicates dampness obstructing the bladder. The abdominal swelling signals a blockage in the small abdomen caused by the Jueyin. When the Jueyin is excessive, the pulse becomes knotty; when it moves, it causes abdominal swelling. I suggest moxibusting the Jueyin meridians in her feet, one on each side, which will prevent involuntary urination and promote clear urination, alleviating her abdominal pain. Additionally, I shall prepare a medicinal decoction for her. After three days, the dampness will dissipate, and she will recover.<a id="trans-303p" href="#orig-303p" class="marker">[303p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Records of Travels and Official Matters&quot; states: When Xin Jiaxuan first returned from the north to serve in Jiangnan, he suddenly suffered from a severe illness related to the testicles, which swelled large like a cup. A certain person taught him to procure leaf pearls (which refer to Coix seeds), fry them with the yellow earth of the east, then boil them down with water until soft, and grind them into a paste in a sand pot. Each time, he would mix this paste with two qian of non-ash liquor and consume it, thus achieving a cure. In his later years, Mr. Sha Sui also contracted this illness, and Xin taught him this remedy, which also cured him. However, people in the city cannot find leaf pearls, so they can simply buy Coix seeds from herbal shops, which are also effective. According to the &quot;Materia Medica,&quot; the highest quality Coix seed is considered superior medicine for nourishing life, and consuming it in large quantities is not harmful. For those who wish to lighten their bodies and prolong life, it has a sweet, slightly cold, and non-toxic flavor. It is primarily used to alleviate contractions that hinder movement, remove wind and dampness, ease breathlessness, eliminate cold and evil qi from the muscles and bones, benefit the digestive system, reduce edema, and improve appetite; prolonged use can lighten the body and enhance energy. Its roots are known to host three parasites. They can be harvested in Zhen ding, Pingze, and fields in August, while the roots can be gathered at any time. They are abundant and truly effective medicine. In Shu, there are many Coix seeds among the Ba Peng. Scholars and gentlemen gift them to each other, mixing them into their food. In the city of Rao, there is a lineage student suffering from kidney deficiency and lower back pain. Mr. Sha Sui applied the prescription passed down from his esteemed person, soaking Eucommia bark in wine, roasting it dry, and grinding it into powder. He mixed it with non-ash liquor for consumption.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A monk suffered from a hernia, manifesting cold energy that rose to the teeth and descended to the kidneys, tight like a rope; at times, both testicles swelled and felt cold. A physician examined his pulse, finding it fine and weak, and diagnosed it as an autumn pulse. This was due to the metal element being above, which attacked the liver wood below; wood fears metal, thus it cannot extend, resulting in such illness. The liver energy was restrained and unable to nourish the testicles, hence their coldness—truly, it was not from coldness. Metal restrains wood, which transmits to the stomach earth; the stomach belongs to the yangming, hence the upward manifestation to the teeth; the illness was not a dental issue. The liver wood is the mother of heart fire. When the mother cannot extend, the offspring (testicles) also retract, causing them to be cold while fluids accumulate around them. The classic states: when wood is obstructed, it can be opened; when earth is obstructed, it can be drained. After allowing for four releases, he indeed felt the energy harmonize, and the testicles became itchy and warm. The physician remarked: the energy has now entered the testicles. By using fennel and curcuma for medication, with consistent use, he was cured in a month.</p>
<p>Scholar Huo&#39;s son, aged twelve, had swelling and drooping on one side of his testicles. The physician observed that this was due to fright.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li Shenyin, the county official of Runan, suffered from a swelling and excruciating pain in his testicles due to labor for the king, after drinking water while sitting on the wet ground. The dampness descended and flowed into the area, causing the pain. He tried various medicines, including gold bells and Sichuan toon fruit, but they had no effect. He sought treatment from Dai, who said he could take &quot;Xieshui Pill.&quot; Shenyin was confused by this. </p>
<p>After several days, the pain became unbearable, so he decided to consult Dai again. Dai first administered boat-car pills and Jun Chuan powder, leading to the expulsion of greenish froth in great quantity, which relieved the pain. Then he took fennel pills and Wuling powder to regulate the condition, and within three days, the swelling subsided, never to return in his later years. The hernia is related to the liver meridian. The green froth expelled corresponds to the color of the liver.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: a wealthy man once noticed a foul smell from his groin area and, after days of drinking alcohol, felt discomfort in his abdomen and sought my treatment.

All foul smells relate to the heart&#39;s control, dispersing into the five directions as five odors. Entering the liver, it manifests as a foul odor, which is one aspect. </p>
<p>Therefore, one should drain the liver meridian at its branches to address the root cause; after that, drain the lesser chong in the heart meridian to address the symptoms. If there is a malignancy, medicinal treatment should be employed to eliminate it. Alcohol is both warming and flavorful, capable of producing internal dampness and heat. This creates a condition where wind and dampness coalesce in the lower jiao as a pathology. Thus, it is said: &quot;the lower jiao acts like a drainage.&quot; It is also said: &quot;draw out what is below.&quot; Alcohol is a damp and heated liquid, so it should be expelled from the groin area.<a id="trans-307p" href="#orig-307p" class="marker">[307p]</a></p></div>

I also prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus Ban Xia, adding Huang Lian, Shao Yao, Chuan Xiong, and Sheng Jiang, decocting for five or six doses to stabilize him.</p>
<p>I once treated a person suffering from post-drinking water who had severe pain in the left testicle. I moxibusted the Da Dun point. Happily, I had a waist ointment on hand, which contained Wu, Fu, Ding Xiang, and She Xiang. I used it to massage over the horizontal bone at the top of his pouch, covering it with warm cloth; the pain immediately ceased. After one night, the swelling also disappeared.&quot;<a id="trans-308p" href="#orig-308p" class="marker">[308p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I once had a stockpile of tangerines, but later, while traveling in the mountains and suffering from great hunger, I encountered tangerines and edible roots, eating them. The tangerines disturbed my old stockpile, and the roots caused stagnation in my qi. Immediately, my right abdomen became swollen and I experienced both cold and heat. I first took one or two doses of a stomach-regulating potion, then in the morning focused my spirit and qi. Eventually, I felt the accumulation moving and vomited. After vomiting, my stomach qi settled, and my meridians opened, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Zhu, a fellow practitioner from Chi&#39;an, was forty years old. After the rain on the full moon in August, he experienced severe abdominal pain at midnight, sweating profusely. He stomped his feet against a wall in agony, with pain concentrated in the lower abdomen, making it intolerable to touch. His pulse was tense, thin, and firm, and upon palpation, it felt like pressing against a knife&#39;s edge. When questioned, he stated that he had bathed in deep pools during the extreme heat of June, which might have caused his illness. I prescribed the Da Cheng Qi Decoction, resulting in slight diarrhea and the pain subsided.</p>
<p>However, the pain returned the next evening at the time of You, again concentrated in the lower abdomen and hard to the touch. I prescribed another dose of Da Cheng Qi Decoction with added cinnamon, ground peach kernels mixed in and decocted together. This time, the bowel movement yielded dark purple blood, and the pain ceased immediately. The next evening at You, the pain returned as before; although his pulse was slightly weaker, it still had a firm quality. I gave him the Da Cheng Qi Decoction with added aconite in two doses and combined the ground peach kernels for decoction. After a bowel movement, he expelled about two sheng of dark purple blood that resembled broken cotton, and the pain ceased, allowing him to sleep through the night. </p>
<p>On the following day at You, the pain returned as initially experienced. Upon inquiry, his lower abdomen felt relaxed and soft, the pain radiated around the navel area, and his pulse was harmonious, suggesting he might be free of illness, yet he still sighed as before. After learning that he had eaten some radish vegetable soup over two meals, I prescribed Xiao Jian Zhong Tang for one dose, and he recovered.<a id="trans-309p" href="#orig-309p" class="marker">[309p]</a></p></div>

Take five bitter orange seeds and seven peach kernels, grind them finely, boil them in one cup of flowing water, and then take them hot with Baohe pills to recover.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In the Gui Chou year, I received a decree to go to Liupan Mountain. I was commanded to treat a long-term hernia known as &quot;fire child&quot; and &quot;red knot.&quot; Additionally, during July, due to hunger and labor, combined with excessive consumption of warm milk, the symptoms worsened significantly, with the patient&#39;s complexion turning pale and yellow, experiencing cramps in the abdomen, excruciating pain, an inability to stretch the waist, and slight relief when applying hot substances. The pulse was thin and rapid. I recalled that the &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that this condition, designated as a man&#39;s illness, is caused by phlegm accumulating in the small intestine due to cold. Only powerful heat remedies can cure it. I then formulated a prescription named “Agarwood and Cinnamon Pill,” and the patient recovered after taking it.</p>
<p>Madam Zhao, the wife of the envoy, aged fifty-eight, in March of the Jiaxu year, experienced cold pain in the navel area, radiating to her sides with unbearable pain, restlessness, and an inability to lie down peacefully.

<p>The &quot;Medical Principles&quot; mentions: Yang Chun&#39;s elder brother had a prior condition affecting kidney qi, causing pain extending to the left side and chest, with much phlegm and occasional obstruction in the diaphragm. The large intestine was constipated, and he typically sweated little. His pulse was tense. I administered twenty pills each of Baohe and Wenzhong, ground peach kernels and (Mu Yu) plum kernels, and he recovered after swallowing them.<a id="trans-311p" href="#orig-311p" class="marker">[311p]</a></p></div>

<p>The 37th Grand Commander suddenly suffered from small intestine gas pains, and the doctors in the capital prescribed medications that proved ineffective. Each episode brought him close to death. The Emperor summoned Du to present medication; however, it did not show results after several doses. The Grand Commander expressed that his time was short, and he was unable to be cured even by a skilled doctor. The Emperor called Du to inquire why. Du replied: &quot;I have used the ancient formulas, but there was no improvement. Today, I have composed a new prescription that I have not yet dared to present. I will first prepare the medicine and administer it to the Grand Commander.&quot; </p>
<p>The first dose showed an 80-90% improvement, and after a second dose, he fully recovered.

Half a month later, his right testicle became enlarged, gradually resembling the shape of a bucket. The local physicians in Fujian treated him with liver channel remedies and warming herbs, but after half a year without success, he returned to consult me. I said: his love for fire liquor has filled his body with damp heat, while wading in the cold water has left him cold and damp on the outside. Now, as his illness is on the right side, it points to dampness in the spleen and lungs affecting the testicles. I used Wei Ling Tang with added Zhi Zi, Zhi Qiao, Huang Bo, and ten doses of fennel, slightly reducing the dosage. I then formed it into pills, and he took them up to eighteen jin, after which he was completely well.

Further treatment with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with Huangbai, Bai Zhi, and Jin Yin Hua for four doses alleviated the pain. He was then treated with several doses of a guiding and detoxifying powder and recovered. </p>
<p>It is common to find patients unwilling to undergo needling, waiting for the sore to rupture on its own, but they do not realize that in crucial areas, if there is pus, it is necessary to needle urgently to allow the poison to escape and prevent internal rupture. Therefore, the ancients said: &quot;For sores, if they are not needled or cauterized, toxins cannot be resolved, and pus and blood cannot be released.&quot; They also mentioned the need to open up to expel the toxins. Patients mistakenly believe that critical areas should not be needled, which is a significant misunderstanding.<a id="trans-318p" href="#orig-318p" class="marker">[318p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from a hanging abscess; the pus was mature but did not rupture, and his pulse was rapid and weak, indicating a deficiency in both qi and blood. He wished to treat it with tonifying yin and nourishing qi and blood herbs, and also apply acupuncture to help drain the toxic pus outward. However, he was doubtful and did not follow this method, instead using fire-reducing and toxin-expelling medicines, which led to a further weakening of his vital energy and an exacerbation of the sore. Eventually, it ruptured without healing, leading to a condition from which he could not be saved. </p>
<p>The symptoms of a hanging abscess originally stem from a deficiency of yin in the liver and kidney meridians. Though treatment might be possible with nourishment, there is still great risk of failure, especially as the pus develops and is further attacked; how could he survive? Typically, when it starts with swelling and pain or with red, painful urination, one should first use a couple of doses of prepared licorice and moxibustion on garlic, followed by taking Longdan Xiegan Tang (Gentian Decoction to Drain the Liver). </p>
<p>If there is fever and swelling pain, one should use Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) with additions of Plantago, Huangbo, Chuanxiong, and Danggui. When pus has formed, it should be pierced. If it has already ruptured, use Ba Zhen Tang (Eight Treasure Decoction) with additions of prepared licorice, Chaihu shoots, wine-fried Huangbo, and Zhimu. </p>
<p>If urination is scanty but the pulse is strong, continue with Longdan Xiegan Tang and add prepared licorice. If urination is scanty and the pulse is weak, use Qingxin Lianzi Yin (Heart-Clearing Lotus Seed Decoction) with prepared licorice. If the pus is clear and does not congeal, use a great tonifying formula and intermittently apply moxibustion with fermented soybeans. If it fails to congeal for a long time, use moxibustion with Fuzi cakes, and it will be effective.<a id="trans-319p" href="#orig-319p" class="marker">[319p]</a></p></div>

I prescribed a modified Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added licorice, Schisandra, and Mai Men Dong, for over thirty doses. His appetite improved slowly. I also administered over fifty doses of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, which led to the resolution of the pus and ulcers.

<p>A neighbor, thirty years old, had a chancre, and despite repeated requests for treatment, he did not adhere to dietary restrictions.

I stated: this condition resides in the Jue Yin, and the prescribed medicines did not correspond to the symptoms. I therefore created Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added gentian, Coptis, and Hu Huang Lian, administering four doses, and his illness dramatically improved.</p>
<p>Associate Scholar Liu Hua Fu occasionally experienced pain in his torso, or white fluids from his orifices, or constipation with difficult urination. Initially, I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added gardenia, Zexie, Coptis, Muku, gentian, and Poria; this was to clear liver fire and guide out damp heat, and his various symptoms gradually improved.

<p>One man had painful swelling of the penis, urination like dripping, severe spontaneous sweating, and occasionally a little blood in the urine, with a pulse that was rapid and forceful, yielding a feeling of weakness when pressed.

<p>The &quot;Essentials of the Jade Machine&quot; states: When there is spontaneous sweating and reduced urination, one should not use medicine to promote urination. If spontaneous sweating occurs, bodily fluids have been lost externally, resulting in diminished urination. If one promotes urination, the nourishing and protective Qi will become depleted, failing to control heat, which will worsen the irritability and heat. One should wait for the heat to recede and sweating to cease before urination resumes. Moreover, this condition pertains to the Yangming meridian, and promoting urination is decidedly contraindicated.</p>
<p>One man had swelling of the penis, or experienced pain, or had a persistent erection; another man felt pain in the penis, with tight and shortened sinews or itchiness, and white discharge resembling semen that followed urination. This indicates a hernia of the sinews, which could be treated successfully with Longdan Decoction. Zhang Zihe stated: Involuntary urination and urinary retention, impotence, and slippery white discharge are all types of hernia in men, and should not be casually attributed to cold in the kidneys. If there is excessive blood loss over the month, after the menstruation ends, there may be heat in the lower back and knees, numbness in the feet, dryness in the throat, urinary retention, a mass in the lower abdomen that may be fixed or moveable, protrusion of the vulva, or hemorrhoids in the rectum—these are all hernias in women.

<p>Shen Niwen, twenty years old, suffered from a left-sided toxin.

However, after entering a room, he developed a fever and thirst, and pain also appeared on the right side. The pus was thin and clear, and all signs of deficiency emerged with a strong yet weak pulse, a dire situation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman of simple, harsh life suffered from anger and resulting toxicity. Some used cooling and toxin-expelling medicine, which instead caused internal heat, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, irregular menstruation, and dry mouth and throat. I suggested that this stagnant qi harmed the spleen and further hurt by medication. I first prescribed several doses of Angelica Decoction, followed by over fifty doses of Xiaoyao Powder, at which point all symptoms improved.</p>
<p>A scholar named Ling Daizhi, over forty years old, suffered from toxicity, excess exertion, little appetite, unsatisfactory bowel movements, and weak pulse. Dongyuan states: slippery essence cannot be contained, leading to spontaneous bowel movement, heavy waist and legs, indicating deficiency below. Zhongjing says: a weak pulse indicates both qi and blood deficiency. I first administered Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoction with added toasted paper and nutmeg to stop diarrhea, and improve appetite; then I gave over ten doses of the Complete Ginseng and Tonifying Decoction combined with menstrual herbs, which resolved his condition.</p>
<p>A man developed a swollen abscess that impeded urination, prompting urgent acupuncture treatment.

<p>A man had a swollen scrotum resembling crystal, with intermittent pain and itching, accompanied by fluid discharge. Pressing the lower abdomen made a water sound, and there was frequent urination with a slow pulse. This condition resulted from excessive drinking and sweating after intoxication exposed to wind, leading to a gathering of cold, damp, and toxicity in the scrotum, termed water hernia. Initially, I gave two doses of Water-Expelling Pills, which resolved abdominal fluid and returned urination to normal; then I prescribed Weiling Powder, increasing the amounts of Bai Zhu and Fu Ling, and finally used qi acupuncture to draw out the accumulated fluid, achieving a cure.<a id="trans-329p" href="#orig-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a></p></div>

<p>A man has a cystic abscess, with severe swelling and pain, red urination, fever, and a rapid pulse. Using Longdan Xiegan Decoction, with increased amounts of plantago seed, alisma, houttuynia, and poria, the condition diminished by half; with the same decoction, but adding rhizoma coptidis and honeysuckle on top, it reduced further to two or three doses, and urination returned to normal, but one area remained unresolved, indicating it would turn to pus. Using the previous decoction again, adding honeysuckle, angelica, and soapweed prickly ash for six doses caused slight swelling and pain, with a slippery and rapid pulse, indicating pus had formed, and needed lancing; after this, the swelling and pain completely receded. Nourishing yin and detoxifying medicines were applied, along with powdered perilla, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another man had a cystic abscess with severe condition, and a pulse that was ominously strong. He received two doses of the previous decoction, and the swelling reduced. Two doses of Xianfang Huoming Decoction helped with the pain. Upon examining his pulse, it was slippery and rapid, indicating pus had formed and required lancing; otherwise, the scrotum would ulcerate. Although he doubted my words and opted to see another doctor, ultimately he suffered severe rupture and had his testicles hanging. After seeking treatment again, his pulse seemed calmer. Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus, rhizoma coptidis, anemarrhena, and gardenia, along with powdered perilla, resulted in recovery in several days.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A weak person suffered from a pouch abscess, which had become swollen and painful with purulent accumulation, and they experienced urgent constipation. After being needled, about three bowls of pus were expelled, and the person fell into a deep sleep. Upon waking, their spirit was slightly restored. However, the needles were delayed, and although detoxifying medicines were applied, everything was still in a state of decay. Therefore, the use of the Pungent Resisting Medicine was necessary, with over thirty doses administered before healing occurred. Generally speaking, this condition pertains to a deficiency of the yin, with damp-heat causing obstruction, hence medicines to nourish yin and dispel dampness cannot be neglected. When treating swelling and pain with constipation, the primary approach is damp-dispelling, supplemented by yin-nourishing. Once the swelling and pain have subsided and urination is normalized, a combination of damp-dispelling and yin-nourishing medicines is used. If pus is desired, the focus should be on the Pungent Resisting Medicine, with yin-nourishing as a supplement. Once the pus is formed, needling is again applied, alongside the Pungent Resisting and yin-nourishing medicines. Once dampness and toxins have been eliminated, solely the Pungent Resisting Medicine is used. If the pus is clear or if the condition is progressing slowly, large tonifying medicines along with fermented soybean cakes or aconite cakes can be applied.</p>
<p>Lu Wuxuan, the Lord of the Liang, who was over fifty years of age, suffered from a pouch abscess, and the sore did not close for over a year. Upon diagnosis, there was slight damp-heat present, and he was treated with Longdan Xie Gan Decoction, after which the damp-heat completely retreated. He was then treated with the Pungent Resisting Medicine and moxibustion with fermented soybean cakes, leading to recovery. The following year, he again suffered from substantial damp-heat and was treated with four doses of the previous decoction, which resulted in significant reduction of the condition, and then he was treated with yin-nourishing medicines for resolution. If after the rupture he remains deficient without proper supplementation, younger patients may develop leaks, while older and weaker patients may not recover. If the pus is clear and the craving for water is strong, with a large pulse, the treatment is also not given.<a id="trans-331p" href="#orig-331p" class="marker">[331p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Hutong, from Shaanxi, over fifty years old, experienced swelling and pain in the scrotum, worsening with heat. Treatments with Pancong San and similar medicines were ineffective; the pulse was rapid. This was an abscess in the scrotum caused by damp-heat in the liver channel. Pus had formed, so urgent needling was performed, and Longdan Xiegan Decoction was administered, leading to improvement in pulse and symptoms. Furthermore, nourishing Yin medicines were added, along with external applications of fir ash and perilla powder. After a month, he recovered. Although this condition burst severely, it was not harmful, and the patient was able to manage it carefully.</p>
<p>Another official aged over sixty had unbearable pain from a scrotal rupture, with the testicles exposed. He was given Longdan Xiegan Decoction and had applications of wheat charcoal and perilla powder, but there was no improvement. I believed this indicated excessive dampness, so first a bowl of Sophora japonica flower wine was given, followed by the decoction, leading to slight recovery; then nourishing Yin medicines were added, and after a month, he regained stability. If the previous medicine had been ineffective, employing harsh measures would likely have weakened the middle Qi, causing further harm.</p>
<p>One individual, drinking for consecutive days, had damp pruritus in the scrotum. Nourishing Yin medicines were prescribed but did not take effect. I inferred this to be related to the liver meridian of the lower Yin, where the genitalia protruded. He had a history of dampness, and the subsequent alcohol intake resulted in a combination of damp-heat in the lower jiao. The classics state: “The lower jiao is like a drain,” and also say: “Those below should be drawn out.” Therefore, Longdan Xiegan Decoction and Qingzhen Decoction were used, leading to curing. If these did not suffice, it would be prudent to switch to Liver Nourishing Decoction and Sisheng San for treatment.<a id="trans-332p" href="#orig-332p" class="marker">[332p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A Confucian scholar named Chen Shiyong, after failing an exam, drank liquor one evening and went to bed, but his wife did not receive him. The next day, he experienced swelling and pain in his scrotum and sent someone to seek treatment. I prescribed a remedy to clear damp heat and liver fire. The city gates were closed at night, and he could not return in time to take the medication. The following morning, it was reported that during the night his scrotum had completely rotted, and the area beneath the glans was also rotting. This was due to liver fire combined with alcohol toxicity and excessive damp heat. I then added ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to the previous medicine. The rotten flesh fell off completely, and the testicles were hanging. I used a great tonic for qi and blood and applied angelica ointment, leading to the complete recovery of the scrotum.</p>
<p>Liang Zhenshan, a palace attendant, suffered from a scrotal abscess, which was swollen, red, painful, and accompanied by difficult urination, alternating chills and fever, and thirst. This was due to yin deficiency of the liver and kidneys with damp heat descending. Hence, I decided to clear the liver fire and eliminate the damp toxins. I prescribed chih-shu, roasted gentian, evodia, roasted coptis, angelica, honeysuckle, soapberry thorn, red peony, ledev, akebia, and licorice. After one dose, the swelling and pain gradually subsided. I added a bit more ledev and akebia, alongside chuanxiong and poria, to make a drink, which nourished the kidney essence. The heat and swelling both retreated. However, there remained a thread of tissue that did not dissolve; this was due to deficiency in blood and qi of the liver channel. I needed to nourish the kidney water, so I used a formula of six ingredients, substituting poria with five flavors, and then made another drink with a tonic to enhance qi, adding poria. With these, the tissue disappeared completely, and he was healed.<a id="trans-333p" href="#orig-333p" class="marker">[333p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man from Jingzhao, named Zhu Erfeng, experienced swelling and pain in the scrotum, which he believed to be hernia. Upon examining his pulse, which was rapid and slippery, I determined this to be a scrotal abscess. It arose from deficiency in the liver and kidney meridians, combined with damp-heat; pus had already formed. After taking a dose of the Vitality Elixir, it burst, and I prescribed herbs to nourish yin and expel toxins to heal it.</p>
<p>Another client, consuming rich foods, had a swollen scrotum and difficulty urinating, indicating accumulated heat in the middle jiao. This was compounded by a deficiency allowing it to descend. Initially, I used Longdan Decoction to clear the liver, adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Huanglian, and Niuxi. Gradually, he improved. Later, I prescribed Baizhen Decoction combined with Chaihu and Shanzhizi, leading to recovery. However, due to disregarding dietary restrictions, he relapsed, for which I again used Baizhen Decoction, concurrently applying Zhongyi Qi-ing Decoction and Six Flavor Pill, achieving cure. Due to overexertion causing heat, he self-medicated with Sibai, Huangbo, and Zhimu, resulting in all symptoms manifesting and the ulcer situation worsening. I indicated his five organs were deficient in qi and blood. I prescribed Zhongyi Qi-ing for the morning and Liu Junzi with Danggui for the evening, using over fifty doses, leading to gradual closure of the ulcer, followed by Six Flavor Pill for regulation, resulting in healing.</p>
<p>A man entered the room inebriated, presenting with a swollen scrotum as large as a bowl, abdominal distension, difficult urination with redness, fever, and dryness in the mouth, significantly obstructed phlegm. This highlighted a deficiency of the bladder yin, under threat from wine toxins. I utilized Six Flavor Pill augmented with Cheqian and Niuxi as drinks, supplemented with Zizhuan Wan to nourish the kidneys, causing the symptoms to abate. I added doses of Wuweizi and Maidong, achieving recovery. Later, I employed Zhongyi Qi-ing Decoction with Maidong and Wuweizi for convalescence.

Therefore, Mr. Dongyuan said that in cases of spleen deficiency, with sinking of the vital energy, manifested as fever, thirst, and fatigue, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to uplift and nourish Yang energy, thereby promoting the production of Yin blood. If mistakenly considered as kidney deficiency and treated with Si Wu, Huangbo, and Zhimu, it would instead harm the spleen and stomach, exacerbating the deficiency. Moreover, Huangbo and Zhimu are ingredients that drain Yang and nourish Yin; if there is not an excess of Yang fire in the bladder failing to produce Yin fluids, leading to fever, they should not be used.</p>
<p>A man over fifty suffered from an abscess with clear pus and had weak liver and kidney pulses. This was due to carelessness regarding alcohol and passion, leading to damp heat stagnation. However, with clear pus and weak pulses, and at an old age, how could he be treated effectively? Furthermore, the valley path is where the Ren channel originates, and it is the gathering place for the liver meridian; thus, treatment would be difficult, and he ultimately died. In treating this abscess, I found that water from the stream combined with licorice was effective; if it had ruptured, using Shiquan Dabu Decoction would be essential.<a id="trans-336p" href="#orig-336p" class="marker">[336p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar suffered from a hanging sore and took Kanli pills, along with herbs such as Siwu, Huangbo, and Zhimu, but saw no response. His pulse was floating and strong, but when pressed, it was weak and thin. I believed it was the result of deficiency in the three Yin. I used Tori San and then Bu Yin Tori San, and he gradually improved; later, I prescribed Liu Wei Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish and restore his vitality, and he healed within half a year. Generally, for sores and similar conditions, if the Yang Qi of the kidney is excessive, causing the Yin fluid to fail to transform, leading to symptoms of Yin deficiency and fever, it is appropriate to use Kanli pills, as their bitter and cold properties can drain the internal fire of water, allowing the Yang Qi to weaken, thereby facilitating the generation of water. Conversely, if the Yang Qi is weak, preventing the transformation of Yin fluid and causing the same symptoms, Liu Wei Wan should be used, whose sour and warming qualities can generate the water within fire, allowing the Yang Qi to flourish, naturally enabling the emergence of Yin. Moreover, cases like this, attributed to the depletion of essence and Qi in the kidney, occur in 80 to 90 percent of patients, while those due to excessive Yang Qi in the kidney occur only 1 or 2 percent of the time. However, among people in Jiangnan suffering from this condition, many belong to the spleen channel, experiencing depletion of Yin blood and descent of original Qi. It is essential to use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to raise and nourish the Yang Qi, enabling the growth of Yin. If there is excessive desire leading to depletion of true water, Liu Wei Wan should be employed to replenish the original Qi of the kidney and generate essence and blood, along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the vital Qi of the spleen and lungs, thereby enriching the kidney&#39;s water. The classics say that those with Yin deficiency also have spleen deficiency. Yet, many mistakenly believe it to be a fire condition of the kidney channel, using Huangbo and Zhimu, further damaging the spleen and lungs, cutting off their sources of transformation, leading to further deterioration.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar suffered from a hanging sore, with symptoms including reddish, painful urination, weakness and swelling in the feet after exertion, fever, dry mouth, parched tongue, reduced appetite, and fatigue worsening by evening. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood unable to resolve the issue. Thus, an Eight Treasures Decoction was used, supplemented with wheat kernel and yam, and a higher dosage of prepared licorice was administered. All symptoms gradually subsided, but the affected area remained swollen and painful, indicating pus formation within. After five doses, the pus began to discharge, and after more than fifty doses, the sore was nearly healed. However, due to labor and discontinuation of medicine, he experienced chills and fever, increased thirst, and significant swelling and pain with more pus. A tonic was prepared using the Middle Qi Benefiting Decoction, adding roasted gardenia for two doses, which provided slight improvement. Following this, the Eight Treasures Decoction was augmented with Ophiopogon and Schisandra for over a hundred doses, leading to the complete resolution of swelling and pain. He was pleased with his careful lifestyle, moderation in diet, and consistent use of tonics, which maintained his well-being. Yet, with exertion, one or two drops of pus would still emerge. Later, influenced by external advice, he took internal medications to purge fire and external applications to erode the sore, attempting to restrict it, which resulted in a severe breakdown of the affected area, nearly incapacitating him, but ultimately he restored and healed through tonics.</p>
<p>The &quot;Textbook of Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from a hanging sore for over ten days, with swelling and pain progressing to significant fever in the evening and difficulty urinating. Two doses of Longdan Xiegan Decoction were given, slightly alleviating urination but leaving lingering pain, indicating impending pus formation. Two doses of Tori Xiaodu Powder were then administered, augmented with pangolin scales, soapberry thorns, and Alisma, leading to pus discharge.

<p>A man, newly married, sustained an injury to the penis, with severe bleeding and pain. First, he soaked it in scallion soup for a long time, and subsequently used a pearl powder mixed with borneol. The rotten skin gradually dried, and the pain lessened; internally, he took the Four Substance Decoction with added Mutong and San Zhi for four doses, after which the swelling and pain gradually stopped, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man experienced swelling of the skin that was shiny and felt hot and painful. He applied a golden powder externally and took Longdan decoction with Da Huang internally, which somewhat alleviated the pain. After removing the Da Huang, he took further treatment and improved.</p>
<p>The text &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: &quot;To nurture the essence of Master Wang Taigong, one&#39;s spirit should be kept inward, and in all matters, one should practice humility and retreat. Reaching the age of seventy, he maintains a youthful appearance, presumably due to a complete reception from heaven without harm from others. Historically, he has only suffered from a weak constitution; he watches his diet closely. In recent years, he developed a hernia in the lower abdomen that resembled a magpie&#39;s egg. After multiple occurrences, it gradually grew larger and longer, easily descending from the lower abdomen into the scrotum, making repositioning difficult. The slightest chill to the lower body would trigger it. Upon onset, it required the clumps of cold air to gradually warm up before it could soften and retract; otherwise, it would bulge at the narrow opening and could not return. Recently, the swelling enlarged further, feeling like a wine bottle lying across the hips, half in the lower abdomen and half in the scrotum, firm and tight like stone, with a pressure radiating to the front and back, causing simultaneous swelling in the meridians around the waist and navel.&quot;<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when the illness attacks the stomach, there will be severe vomiting; when it attacks the top of the head, there will be trembling and fear of cold, and the stability of breathing will be disturbed. Last winter, I observed a sudden onset of symptoms, realizing it was due to the upward invasion of earth qi. I urgently used a strong dose of ginseng, aconite, ginger, and cinnamon to treat it, and it was cured after just one dose. Since then, whenever such symptoms arise, I&#39;ve relied on ginger and cinnamon for quick effects. Now, at the end of May, while Chang was away, his symptoms persisted over several days, so he took more than twenty doses of the Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, yet the effects were very slow. However, I doubted the condition&#39;s severity, not the medicine&#39;s efficacy. At this time, Mr. Yu, an elder in the family, was supervising the funds in Zhejiang, and he commented from afar that even with a hundred doses of Shi Quan Da Bu, it would still be effective, so I made a firm decision to continue the treatment. By Mid-Autumn, the symptoms recurred. Chang again used ginger, cinnamon, ginseng, and aconite for results. His son advised Mr. Lao, but both were uncertain of the way forward. Chang requested a deeper explanation of the principles involved. The principle is that when there is yang deficiency, we use the Four Gentlemen; when there is yin deficiency, we use the Four Substances; and when both yin and yang are deficient, we combine the Four Gentlemen and Four Substances, adding flavors to create Shi Quan Da Bu. This is the correct and harmonious way to approach healing.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the stagnant and turbid Yin qi that accumulates in the lower abdomen to form a tangible mass, this indicates an extreme excess of Yin. How can one treat it with methods for Yin deficiency, thereby aiding the pathogen and worsening the illness? Why do I say this? Women who are pregnant may suffer from illnesses like cold damage and, when unavoidable, might use harmful medicines such as hemp, cinnamon, or salts that endanger the fetus. However, if one adds the Four Substances (Si Wu), the harsh medicines can no longer enter the womb to harm the fetus. Can one really desire to eliminate the pathogen within, only to use the Four Substances for protection instead? This is one example. </p>
<p>Every case of lumps or masses leads to a weakened body and depleted blood; despite numerous methods to remove them, there is no improvement. Yet, using the Four Substances results in an immediate increase in the condition. The Four Substances cannot generate or invigorate blood, and merely contribute to worsening the problem—this is another instance. The blood vessels of the human body rely entirely on food and nourishment to grow. The stagnation of the Four Substances affects the spleen, which is not valued by men; given that turbid Yin is already at its peak, when it pulls on the Yin channels, directly impacting the Yang vessels, there is much to be concerned about regarding the encroachment of earth qi. How can one use medicines that are half Yin and half Yang to remedy this? There is no doubt that the inappropriate use of the Four Substances is evident. Even the Four Gentlemen must not be treated lightly in serious cases; one must add the strong effects of ginger, cinnamon, and prepared aconite to truly combat the illness. Why? When Yin pathogens cause harm, if they do not manifest, it’s one thing; but once they erupt, it is certain to be violent.<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the weather declines, it becomes clear; when the earth&#39;s energy rises, it becomes murky, and the human body can generally be seen. However, people only perceive the stillness of the earth&#39;s energy and do not see its movement; classical texts speak only of the decline of yin energy but not of its abundance. Physicians, when faced with diseases directly affecting the yin meridians, often do not know how to treat them, let alone with mixed symptoms. Allow me to discuss the principles of heaven and earth for clarification. The principles of heaven and earth are discussed in detail in the book &quot;Yuanhui Yunshi.&quot; As for the theories surrounding the confusion of the cycles of Xu and Hai, I will not elaborate, believing that at that time heaven and earth merge into one, leaving nothing to discuss. Little do they know that heaven does not mix with earth, while earth does mix with heaven. Indeed, even a slight movement of the earth&#39;s energy can lead to disasters such as landslides and floods, causing changes in peaks and valleys. Therefore, when there is a significant movement in the earth&#39;s energy, its thunderous power can strike swiftly, shaking the void with hundreds of thousands of vibrations, crashing and colliding upwards towards the heavens, surely leading to a merging of heaven and earth? It must be that at the &quot;Zi&quot; time, heaven opens, and the earth&#39;s energy descends slightly, allowing the tall and elevated forms to begin to reveal themselves. At the &quot;Chou&quot; time, the earth is opened, the earth&#39;s energy starts to return to the ground, and the vastness of the sky begins to clarify. During that time, if living beings are not yet able to be born, it is because the earth&#39;s energy descends from heaven without being completely purified. Beyond the nine energies of blue, yellow, red, purple, black, white, and green, there are many fierce and pathogenic energies descending from the void, extending thousands of feet in their reach.<a id="trans-349p" href="#orig-349p" class="marker">[349p]</a></p></div>

Only when the harsh and inferior forces subside, and everything returns to harmony, can beings achieve their growth and gradually move toward繁衍. The cruel and violent nature of阴气, once it arrives at this point, has not been discussed by anyone throughout the ages. How can we know of it? In the &quot;Tripitaka,&quot; the Buddha explains the creation and destruction of the world in detail, and there are no discussions of this kind, as it is already encompassed within the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, requiring no further elaboration. Are not earth, water, fire, and wind one rather than阴邪? The evils of the myriad阴s bring about calamities, the so-called mingling of earthly energies with the heavens is not a mere speculation. Geomancers know to seek the auspicious in the heavenly stems while avoiding the inauspicious in the earthly branches; how then can physicians, who follow the way, fail to consider avoiding calamities when faced with signs of earth energies rising? In the Han Dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing wrote the &quot;Treatise on Sudden Illnesses&quot; in sixteen volumes, but after the fires brought by the troops of Lu Shan, it was lost and not passed down, leaving later generations without the means to see it.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chang understood the principles of the vital energy that mingles with the heavens. When encountering the evidence of邪 (evil forces) rising up and solitary yang causing disturbance, he would quickly apply pure yang medicine to urgently drive away the阴气 (yin energy). With a loud sound, it would emerge from great orifices to dispel the universe and reveal the sun and moon, its effectiveness thus made clear. Just as with the experiences of the great elder, who repeatedly applied ginger and aconite, it should not be merely considered a temporary measure, for it is indeed a continual method for all ages. However, the fierce and violent nature of such remedies seems unsuitable for regular use, and even when employed at the right moment, it cannot avoid the drawback of dryness in the mouth and bitteness on the tongue. Those who are hesitant to use it might not be aware of the necessity of its use. Just like warfare, which can destroy the world, if used wisely, the people will follow; if mismanaged, they will rebel. Today, the troops sent to deal with bandits are under constant surveillance and restrictions; their fierce energy has been turned soft and restrained, forcing them into a truce with the bandits. Upon reaching the areas they pass through, they loot everything, leading to thorns and bad harvests, driving away the good people to become bandits themselves. In the halls of power, they cannot cease warfare and have no strategies for battle, and the situation broadly resembles this. Chang suggests that the principles of medicine be mutually considered.<a id="trans-351p" href="#orig-351p" class="marker">[351p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The solid mass located deep in the lower abdomen lacks a consistent position, and when poison enters through the throat to the stomach, then to the intestines, it will eventually reach its destination. If the old illness is not resolved, a new one is bound to arise. In treating this, one should first make pills from ginger, cinnamon, and prepared aconite root, exposing them to dry thoroughly. Then use ginseng and atractylodes to form a thick outer layer, allowing the throat and stomach to recognize ginseng and atractylodes while remaining unaware of the ginger, cinnamon, and aconite. This approach ensures delivery to the site of the mass, where it can start to dissolve, allowing for the solid mass to be reduced and possibly eliminated.</p>
<p>Currently, the supervising official is overwhelmed, and soldiers fill his ranks, where riches fill the bellies of others while lives hang in others&#39; hands, leading to an inability to effectively deal with the enemy.

This prevents the people from becoming bandits, and those bandits can be returned to the status of civilians. What do the barren mountains and valleys know of the current world? Nonetheless, I will briefly mention a point regarding medical practices, should there be anything useful to share. </p>
<p>Someone asked: The concept of external treatment is quite lengthy in principle; why are ancient methods not applied? I respond: There are many instances where ancient methods are indeed employed. For example, using cinnabar for clothing represents the red of the southern region, which is believed to connect to the heart, ensuring that various medicines are protected and reach the heart effectively. Similarly, using indigo for clothing represents the blue of the eastern region, which connects to the liver, thereby ensuring that the medicines are protected and reach the liver.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of severe sores, a medicine is wrapped in onion leaves; one then chews and swallows the onions, aiming to avoid harming the throat and directly targeting the sore. This principle also applies to decoctions. For instance, when preparing a strong decoction with cinnamon, one adds a few grams of fresh berberine after boiling, and then quickly takes it when cool. The cooked parts act to move downward within, while the fresh parts facilitate outward movement, which aligns with the concept of external treatment.</p>
<p>Zhongjing treated cases of cold damage with yin symptoms, preparing a decoction of whole aconite, and added a few drops of fresh pig bile. This demonstrates that the wise and sacred application of medicine always adheres to principles.<a id="trans-353p" href="#orig-353p" class="marker">[353p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; says: I once treated a young man who, due to accidental exposure to filth and poison, suddenly developed a chancre. It began to ulcerate at the glans, and remedies were ineffective. The condition extended from the glans into the urethra, gradually worsening until it reached the anal area, resulting in swollen and painful segments resembling a fishbone. Each night, pus accumulated at the glans, unable to exit. When attempts were made to alleviate this, urine followed after the pus; washing and applying treatments were futile and the situation was extremely dire. </p>
<p>I happened upon an old man in the mountains who passed on a recipe involving the flowers and stamens of the locust tree. I used it for treatment, and within ten days, the root and stem gradually improved. After half a month, the condition resolved from the inside out, returning to the glans until it was completely healed. Following the healing of the chancre, minor ulcers remained, and I administered a decoction of Sichuan pepper for over ten doses until complete recovery.</p>
<p>I then told the old man about the formula: this remedy effectively treats sexually transmitted sores and heat toxins, which are expelled through urination, enabling the treatment of this chancre. However, those who take this can avoid lifelong complications from sores and toxins. </p>
<p>There are indeed miraculous detoxifying effects evident at the time the sores appear; one may see sudden widespread red spots on the body, which fade after a few days, indicating the areas where toxins are about to erupt. Once the toxins are resolved, the shape of the sore may still be visible, which is a sign of this effect. Initially, I did not believe in this; yet at the time the sores emerged in this man, there indeed weren&#39;t many, and the red spots were conspicuously observed over the entire body, dissipating after two days.
