<p><strong>Pediatric Diseases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pediatric Direct Methods</strong> 【Song Dynasty, Qian Yi】</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Internal and External Pediatric Diseases</strong></p>
<p>In cases of internal pediatric diseases, symptoms include swollen eyes, abdominal distension, diarrhea with greenish-white stools, and gradually becoming emaciated; for external diseases, there may be redness and sores under the nose, frequent rubbing of the nose and ears, or sores on the limbs. For nasal sores, use Orchid Fragrance Powder; for general sores, use White Powder. </p>
<p>For liver diseases (also called tendinous diseases), symptoms are white membranes covering the eyes, possible bloody diarrhea, and emaciation; treat with Rehmannia Pills. </p>
<p>For heart diseases, symptoms include a yellow face with red cheeks and a robust, feverish body; treat with Calming Spirit Pills. </p>
<p>For spleen diseases (also known as corpulent diseases), symptoms encompass a yellow, emaciated body with dry skin and sores; abdominal distension with a craving for soil; treat with Beneficial Yellow Powder. </p>
<p>For kidney diseases (also known as osseous diseases), symptoms include emaciated limbs, widespread sores and scabs, and a preference for sleeping in damp places; treat with Rehmannia Pills. </p>
<p>For lung diseases (also called qi diseases), symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and sores in the mouth and nose; treat with Beneficial Yellow Powder.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>If suffering from tidal fever, one should first nourish the liver and then purge the heart. If one rashly uses drugs like natron and yellow sulfur, it can be harmful. If afflicted with lumps, one should dissolve them; if mistakenly treated with seeds or borax, it can lead to deterioration. Mismanagement of cold damage can also lead to sores. In the case of initial illness manifesting as a hot sore, use Huang Lian Pills; for chronic illness manifesting as a cold sore, use Mu Xiang Pills; for a combination of hot and cold symptoms, use Ru Sheng Pills; if fluids are deficient, use Bai Zhu Powder. All these conditions result from severe illness damaging the spleen and stomach, leading to the loss of bodily fluids. Therefore, strengthening the spleen and stomach should be the priority, and treatment should be applied early to prevent deterioration.</p>
<p>Note: Regarding sore conditions, these may arise from early weaning, excessive consumption of sweets and rich foods, or consuming harsh medications that significantly deplete bodily fluids, resulting in excessive虚火. They may also stem from innate constitution or the mother&#39;s rich diet and emotional influences, all of which require internal adjustment.</p>
<p>If the mouth and tongue are ulcerated, the body is feverish, the cheeks and lips are red, or there is swelling and pain, abdominal discomfort, heat in the palms, dryness in the throat, thirst for water, red urine, nocturnal sweating, and nervousness, this indicates inner and outer conditions of the heart. Use An Shen Pills as main treatment. </p>
<p>If sores appear on the nose, the eyes are red and inflamed, limbs resemble scabs, there are abscesses in front and behind the ears, the neck is swollen, there are lumps in the armpits, or small swellings in the lower abdomen, groin, and scrotum, with urination issues (either discolored or white discharge), nail-biting, head shaking, squinting, a whitish membrane covering the eyes causing light sensitivity and fear of sunlight, bloating with visible veins, and dry mouth with bloody discharge, this indicates inner and outer conditions of the liver. Use Di Huang and Lu Hui Pills as main treatment.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If the head does not grow hair, or has sore scabs, or the hair is tufted, or if the mouth and tongue are red and ulcerated, accompanied by abdominal pain, vomiting, inability to digest milk and food, dry mouth with a craving for dirt, foul-smelling diarrhea, cloudy urine, or if one has dimmed vision and drowsiness, and dislikes the sound of wood, this indicates an internal and external condition of the spleen channel, to be treated with the Fat Child Pill. </p>
<p>If sores form on the nose, there is difficulty in the throat, swollen neck, tooth pain, coughing with alternating chills and fevers, wrinkled skin, shortness of breath, itchy nose with discharge, nosebleeds, and yellowish eyes, this signifies an internal and external condition of the lung channel, to be treated with the Rehmannia Lung Cleansing Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is heat in the brain with phlegm, cold extremities, alternating chills and fevers, watery diarrhea with abdominal pain, foul breath and thirst, ulcerated gums, blackened nails and dark complexion, sores on the body or ears with discharge, or if food is expelled, this reflects an internal and external condition of the kidney channel, to be treated with the Rehmannia Pill. </p>
<p>In cases of heat attacking upwards, or when toxins from pox rise, the situation can develop rapidly, referred to as &quot;running horse dysentery,&quot; requiring urgent application of realgar powder and toad pills. If mild, it leads to decaying gums and painful, swollen lips, which can be treated; if severe, gums may erode completely and submandibular and cheek areas may rot, which is untreatable. </p>
<p>Traditionally, it is said there are twelve signs of unjust dysentery. </p>
<p>Original source by Ni Weide, Ming Dynasty.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The Disease Caused by Deep Deficiency</p>
<p>The harm from deep deficiency arises when the protective qi is weak, allowing coldness to invade; when the vital qi is diminished, leading to injuries from food and drink; and when external factors invade and cause internal damage, resulting in this condition. Parents, due to their pure yang nature, do not wear heavy clothing in deep winter; due to their aversion to cold winds, they do not shed their garments even in the height of summer. Some parents, with their frequent hunger, force-feed after nursing; others, when thirsty, give more liquid after nursing. There are foolish parents who do not discern the effects of cold, heat, food, and drink, hence they do not provide warmth when it is cold, cannot cool down when it is hot, do not quench thirst with drinks, and do not feed adequately when hungry. The child remains silent, holding on to the disease without being able to express it, thus allowing external factors to invade and internal damage to accumulate gradually, leading to the development of deficiency.</p>
<p>Symptoms may include thirst with easy hunger, the ability to eat yet losing weight, abdominal distension with diarrhea, and a whistling sound from the throat. If left untreated for a long time, it may result in eye diseases. This condition manifests as cataracts or closed eyelids that cannot open, with tears resembling paste, and over time leads to pus discharge, finally resulting in the eye becoming desiccated. Why does this happen? It is due to the downward movement of yang qi and the upward reversal of yin qi. The treatment should follow the principles of yin and yang as discussed in the Great Treatise: clear yang exits from the upper orifices, while turbid yin exits from the lower orifices; clear yang activates the pores, while turbid yin affects the five organs; clear yang fills the limbs, while turbid yin returns to the six bowels. Each should be returned to its origin, not reversed from its normal state; this is how it should be treated. One should prepare formulas to raise yang and lower yin, such as Poria Decoction to Drain Dampness or the formula with Cimicifuga and Gentian. These medicines are not solely for the eyes but also address the aforementioned symptoms. However, one should not delay treatment, as it may become dangerous; parents must be vigilant!<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Rituals of Filial Piety 【Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng】</p>
<pre><code>         Inflammation of the Eyes
</code></pre>
<p>For young children with inflamed eyes that do not open for several days, this is caused by wind-heat. You can take Liangge San to clear the liver channel of excess wind-heat. Once the congestion is resolved, the eyes will open on their own.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Teething Problems</strong></p>
<p>For children with teething issues and tooth decay, this is due to the decay of the gums. The lower teeth are associated with the Hand Yangming Large Intestine meridian, governed by dry metal, while the upper teeth relate to the Foot Yangming Stomach meridian, governed by moist earth. Both are linked to the intestines and stomach. This may be caused by accumulated heat within, or due to the ingestion of toxic substances such as silver powder or dainty beans, which harm the intestines and stomach, rendering dairy and food unable to counter the poison. The toxic vapors then travel along the meridians to the delicate gums and gaps between the teeth, creating harm. It can be treated with musk and jade thread. The wet nurse, before sleeping, should take a dose of Huanglian Detoxifying Decoction, and the dental issues will resolve naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Remarkable and Effective Recipe</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian】</p>
<p><strong>Gastrointestinal Worms</strong></p>
<p>In children, the symptoms of gu (nutritional impairment caused by parasitic infestations) (hiding worms below) include drowsiness and irritability, a runny nose with foul-smelling discharge, sores on the teeth, and black blood in diarrhea. Worms affect the lower body, causing sores on the lower lip; when they affect the organs, sores appear on the upper lip. The &quot;three worms&quot; refer to roundworms, hookworms, and pinworms, of which there are nine types, with pinworms commonly affecting people. Pinworms result from consuming beef and drinking white liquor; if they interconnect, they can be fatal. When medication is taken to expel them, it is best for them to exit in a wrapped, complete form. If the infestation is interconnected, they should be removed promptly. Pinworms predominantly affect children, but adults can also be affected. This condition causes heart pain; if someone is irritable and has a bitter taste in their mouth during the Qing Dynasty, this is also related. Other types of diverse infestations can be detrimental, as everyone has worms in their stomachs; it is advisable to take the Nine Worm Pill to eliminate them.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Infant&#39;s Hundred Questions</strong> (Ming Dynasty, by Lu Bosi)</p>
<p><strong>Thirsting Sickness</strong></p>
<p>All instances of thirsting sickness are illnesses of the spleen and stomach, arising from the loss of bodily fluids. These conditions are often caused by severe illnesses or by vomiting and diarrhea, leading to the weakness of the spleen and stomach and the depletion of internal fluids. Furthermore, children&#39;s thirsting sickness is often worsened by incompetent doctors. When the sickness manifests as tidal fever, it indicates the spleen&#39;s deficiency and the presence of inner heat; thus, the treatment should focus on nourishing the mother organ while purging the affected organ for recovery. </p>
<p>For instance, if the tidal fever occurs at noon, it indicates heart deficiency and heat; since the liver is the mother of the heart, one should first nourish the liver, then purge the heart once the liver is strong, restoring balance and thus alleviating the tidal fever. Doctors who observe tidal fever mistakenly diagnose it as an issue of excess and recklessly use cooling laxatives like rhubarb and other such medicines. This aggressive purging only exacerbates the condition by further depleting bodily fluids, ultimately leading to thirsting sickness. There are also other related ailments where symptoms include intermittent attacks along with sensations of cold or heat, and firm painful sensations beneath the ribs.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The method to treat phthisis should gradually wear away; however, if one uses drastic purgatives like croton seeds or realgar, it can harm children because they easily fluctuate between deficiency and excess. If purged too much, it will deplete the gastric fluids, leading to gradual emaciation due to phthisis. </p>
<p>Children’s organs are delicate, and overeating can easily cause harm. If there is any irregularity in breastfeeding and dietary habits, it is rare not to cause phthisis, which leads to injury. Indulging in sweet, rich, sticky, cold, salty, or sour foods can obstruct the stomach and cause phthisis from accumulation. If the wet nurse maintains an inappropriate regimen or has emotional outbursts while nursing, the condition can be transmitted to the child, stemming from the mother’s ailments—this is beyond the capability of the patient’s family to rectify.</p>
<p>The symptoms of phthisis include a shiny and tense scalp, sparse and burnt hair, a shrunken face with dry nose, a craving for food with pale lips, dark and dull eyes, scratching the nose and eyebrows, a hunched back with a yellowish body, grinding teeth, thirst with sweating, whitish urine, acid diarrhea, abdominal bloating, intestinal rumbling, and a hot, sticky constitution. Those who have a strong desire for melons, salty, sour, charred food, rice, and earth, and crave drinking water all reflect the condition. </p>
<p>Phthisis is classified into five categories, as the disease pertains to the five organs.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Heart dysentery is also known as shock dysentery. The external symptoms include a strong body heat, red face, red lips, sores in the mouth and on the tongue, chest discomfort, dark and frequent urination, five hearts feeling hot, night sweats with thirst, and grinding of teeth due to nervousness.</p>
<p>Liver dysentery is also known as wind dysentery. The external symptoms include head shaking, eye rubbing, white membrane covering the eyes, watery eyes, a dry and frizzy head, blue veins, brain heat, restlessness with thirst, profuse sweating, and diarrhea with sores and rashes.</p>
<p>Kidney dysentery is also known as acute dysentery. The external symptoms include brain heat and muscle weakness, cold hands and feet, alternating cold and heat, loose stools with abdominal pain, dry mouth and nose, sores on gums, black nails, dark complexion, and numerous sores and scabs on the body.</p>
<p>Lung dysentery is also known as qi dysentery, and it is also referred to as dysentery (upper hidden, lower bugs).<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>External symptoms include coughing and wheezing with a strong fever and aversion to cold, skin eruptions, itchy nose and runny nose, sore throat, foul-smelling saliva, abdominal distension, and frequent diarrhea. </p>
<p>Spleen dampness (or food stagnation) is also known as milk dampness. Its external manifestations include yellowing of the body and face, a large abdomen with thin legs, vomiting and nausea, undigested food, acrid-smelling diarrhea, sleepiness with a slackened face, and a decrease in appetite with a craving for dirt.</p>
<p>For various forms of dampness, it is advisable to use large aloe pills, fat baby pills, hu huang lian pills, di huang pills, and raw and cooked di huang decoction, as these are essential medications. Additional remedies include Ji Sheng pills, ti gan san, zhi lian pills, five dampness good prescriptions, zhi sheng pills, tong shen pills, tian ma pills, di huang lung-clearing drink, hua (to conceal lower parasites) pills, ling zhi pills, xia chong pills, long dan pills, huang lian pills, xiang kao pills, mu xiang pills, he brown pills, huang qi soup with soft-shelled turtle blood decoction, oyster shell pills, hou po pills, and others, all of which should be used according to the specific symptoms for detailed treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Kǒng Shāng (Kān)</strong></p>

The spine feels jagged, and there may be sores on all ten fingers, with a tendency to gnaw at the claws.</p>
<p>The condition of cerebral gnawing occurs when the fetus is poorly affected by wind and heat, and after being born, continues to be breastfed in an irregular manner. This results in a shiny and tense scalp, an abundance of scabs on the head, heat in the brain like fire, hair tangling like spikes, excessive sweating throughout the body, and swollen cheeks.</p>
<p>The condition of dry gnawing presents with emaciation and a lack of blood, a dry tongue, and the illness affects the heart. If the eyes are wide open without blinking, with little tearing, the illness is related to the liver; if there’s body heat with dry urine and cold hands and feet, it affects the kidneys; if skin feels scorched and dry while experiencing hard stools, it concerns the lungs; if there’s a spiritless sleep with dry chest and thirst, it relates to the spleen. Overall, these represent five types of gnawing.</p>
<p>The condition of gnawing thirst arises when there is internal wind with gnawing energy, compounded by the wet Nurse’s indulgence in strong tasting foods and alcohol, leading to stagnation and heat in the child’s heart and lungs. During the day, there is agitation, thirst, and refusal to take in breast milk, while at night they have a cessation of craving.</p>
<p>The condition of gnawing diarrhea features burned hair and pale lips, blue veins on the forehead, abdomen distension, and rumbling intestines, leading to excretion of undigested waste; do not use hot medications to stop it.</p>
<p>The condition of gnawing dysentery is related to the effects of wind, cold, heat, and humidity, or the imbalance of hot and cold, or the accumulation of retained food, preventing water and grains from coalescing and resulting in frequent expulsion of harmful substances.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Swelling from malnutrition is due to accumulated toxins and gases mingling, which causes abdominal swelling. This, in turn, gives rise to dampness affecting the spleen, leading to symptoms such as the head, face, hands, and feet feeling swollen and heavy. The treatment should focus on grinding the accumulation and regulating the qi.</p>
<p>For those suffering from malnutrition, there are recurring bouts of fever and heat, with restlessness in the heart and palms. The hands and feet may feel hot, with sores breaking out on the chest. Night sweats and bone heat may occur, along with a dry cough and emaciation. There may also be thirst followed by diarrhea, aversion to food, and a hard abdomen like stone, with a complexion resembling silver; such cases must not be treated.</p>
<p>In cases of unexplained malnutrition, there may be a hard nodular swelling at the back of the head and neck that can be felt to move; it is soft and not painful, sometimes containing worms resembling rice flour. If not dealt with, the worms disperse with heat, corrupting the internal organs and leading to abscesses and sores on the limbs, with pus and blood flowing, significant heat, and emaciation. The skull becomes prominent. Treatment involves needling and applying medicated plasters. Additionally, if a child&#39;s clothing is exposed under the eaves, becoming soiled by feathers from poisoned birds, worms may enter the skin and cause unexplained illness. After washing the clothes, they should be dried lightly over a fire.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>If the hands and feet are exceedingly thin, the neck small with prominent bones, the buttocks slender and the body weak, the abdomen large with a protruding navel, crying with a sunken chest, or if there is a condition associated with malnutrition, this is known as &quot;Ding Xi.&quot; If there are symptoms of fluctuating heat, separation of the skull bones, regurgitation of food with worms, thirst and vomiting, this is termed &quot;bu lu.&quot; Both conditions arise from prolonged deficiency of the spleen and stomach, which cannot digest food and water, leading to diminished spirit and insufficiency of blood and qi, causing the muscles to wither and the kidney energy to be inadequate, which is further harmed by wind and cold, resulting in a faded physical form. There are also instances where the fetus is poisoned, resulting in insufficient blood in the organs. All these are various diseases arising from malnutrition, and when the illness reaches this point, it is indeed grave! It is advisable to use medicinals such as Fei Er Wan, Da Lu Hui Wan, Wu Gan Wan, Hu Huang Lian Wan, Zhi Sheng Wan, Fu Ling Wan, Tian Ma Wan, Di Huang Wan, Shi Quan Dan, Xiang Kuo Wan, He Wan Zi, Xiao Shi Wan, Bie Jia Wan, Xia Chong Wan, Ji Sheng Wan, and Huang Ji Jian Wan for early treatment, which would be ideal for recovery.</p>
<p>There are also chronic malnutritional conditions leading to excessive purging, where the intestines and stomach suffer from dampness, resembling the symptoms of fox-possessed cold and tooth erosion, sometimes referred to as &quot;running horse.&quot; The teeth belong to the kidneys, and if there is kidney deficiency, it can be affected by heat pathogens, thus the malnutrition qi rushes to the upper burner, hence the term &quot;running horse&quot; as a metaphor. Initially, there is bad breath called &quot;stinking breath&quot;; then the teeth darken, leading to severe cases of gum rot and bleeding, termed &quot;exposure.&quot; In the worst cases, all the teeth may fall out. For treatment, one should grind copper sulfate and fresh spider finely, add a small amount of musk, mix and apply to the teeth. If no spider is available, its shell may also be used.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Xu Lei (Emaciation)</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: Emaciation occurs when the spleen and stomach are not in harmony, unable to digest food, leading to weakness of the skin and muscles. It can also arise after a major illness or after vomiting and diarrhea, when the spleen and stomach are still weak and unable to transform and absorb the energy from grains. </p>
<p>Those with cold symptoms experience frequent diarrhea, with pale blue lips; those with heat symptoms have a warm body and slightly yellow muscles. This describes cold and heat types of emaciation. For the cold type, use the Mu Xiang Wan (Saussurea Pill) as the primary treatment, but it should not be taken in the summer; if symptoms are present, it should be taken in moderation. For the heat type, the Hu Huang Lian (Coptis Pill) is indicated, but it should not be taken in the winter; if symptoms are present, it should also be taken in moderation. </p>
<p>For emaciation after contracting a cold, use the Zhu Ye Tang (Bamboo Leaf Decoction) as the primary treatment. Regularly consuming the Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction), Yi Gong San (Extraordinary Merit Powder), or Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (Ginseng and Poria Powder) is also suitable. For long-term use, the Ju Lian Wan (Tangerine and Coptis Pill) can help with weight gain, in conjunction with the Fei Er Wan (Fat Child Pill).<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Medical Accounts of the Right Transmission</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Yu Tuan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Various Types of Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Eating too much rich food causes internal heat; eating too much sweet food leads to fullness in the abdomen. The cause of illness here is due to rich and sweet foods, hence it is termed malnutrition. As for infants in swaddling clothes and children aged four to five years, who are still nursing and have not yet gained full vitality, their digestive energy is not complete. If parents fail to balance their diet and instead indulge in the affection of overfeeding—allowing them to consume excess rich and sweet foods, as well as cold fruits and all manner of cooked and flavorful dishes, for breakfast and dinner—this gradually results in an accumulation of stagnation and firmness, leading to bodily heat and thinness, a pale yellow complexion, a distended abdomen with blue veins, intestinal pain, and diarrhea, thus manifesting the symptoms of malnutrition. </p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang stated: Children suffer from malnutrition often due to the aftermath of a major illness or after vomiting and diarrhea, caused by the medicinal treatment that damages the spleen and stomach, resulting in the loss of bodily fluids. This condition is truly the result of harm done by ignorant physicians. However, this view is only one facet and cannot be considered entirely accurate. Is it not the case that the major illness involving vomiting and diarrhea is often due to food? Since Zhongyang is regarded as the ancestor of pediatric medicine, could he be mistaken? His discussions on the symptoms and treatment of malnutrition are well-documented, and students should study them carefully.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>If the condition (gan) is in the liver, it will cover the eyes; the treatment should nourish the liver, using Dixiao Pill as the primary remedy. If it is in the heart, the cheeks will be red, the body will feel hot; the treatment should nourish the heart, using Anshen Pill as the primary remedy. If it is in the spleen, the body will be yellow, the abdomen swollen, and there will be a craving for dirt; the treatment should nourish the spleen, using Yihuang Powder as the primary remedy. If it is in the lungs, there will be shortness of breath and mouth/nose sores; one should also nourish the spleen, again using Yihuang Powder as the primary remedy, as this pertains to nourishing the weaker organ; if it is in the kidneys, the person will be extremely thin with sores and scabs; the treatment should nourish the kidneys, using Dixiao Pill as the primary remedy. Bone-related conditions prefer lying on a cool surface; one should take the kidney-nourishing Dixiao Pill. If there are internal symptoms like swollen eyes, abdominal distension, irregular bowel movements, perhaps with frothy discharge that is greenish-white, leading to gradual weakness, this is a cold condition, and it would be appropriate to take the Muxiang Pill.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The external sore beneath the nose is red and rotten, and if rubbed, sores appear on the tip of the nose without scabbing, spreading around the eyes. One should treat these sores with herbs such as Lanxiang San and Baifen San. The method states: all sores arise from the internal organs, and by nourishing the mother organ, the child organ will naturally stabilize. For instance, when there is midday heat, it indicates deficiency heat in the heart. The liver is the mother of the heart; therefore, one should first nourish the liver, and only after the liver is strong can one drain the heart. If the heart receives the maternal qi, balance will be restored internally, and the midday heat will subside. All cases should follow this principle. Generally speaking, in treating sores, one must discern between hot and cold, as well as fat and thin: those who are newly affected tend to have fat heat sores, while those suffering for a long time tend to have thin cold sores. For cold, one should use Muxiang Wan, while for heat, one should use Huhuanglian Wan. When both hot and cold sores occur together, use something like Zhi Sheng Wan. However, one must consider the fragility of a child&#39;s internal organs; excessive purging will deplete fluids and lead to sore symptoms. Therefore, pediatricians should treat with a tender heart and adjust carefully, avoiding reckless actions that could interrupt future generations.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Guidelines: Six Essentials (By Ming Dynasty Zhang Sanxi)</h3>
<p><strong>Kang Yan (Pediatric Eye Disease)</strong></p>
<p>Children indulge in rich and sweet foods, are sensitive to cold and heat, and consume raw, oily, and fatty foods that harm the spleen. Sugary and hot items exacerbate fire within, leading to gradual accumulation and the onset of Kang disease. Symptoms include thirst and easy hunger, a good appetite but emaciation, hair standing upright with diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and dry nasal passages, accompanied by a wheezing sound. If left untreated for a long time, the spleen weakens while the liver strengthens, resulting in the liver fire scorching its channels, leading to vision issues and the formation of opacities. The eyelids may stick together and cannot open, and tears become thick. Over time, pus may flow due to the deficiency of the Middle and the failure of clear yang to ascend, while the overabundance of liver fire prevents the turbid yin from descending.</p>
<p>The treatment involves promoting clear and descending turbid: Begin with white atractylodes and ginseng to strengthen the spleen and stomach as the main ingredients. Then, use Bupleurum and bitter orange to assist the main remedy in regulating the spleen. Follow with the supporting herbs: together with poria, water plantain to drain dampness, and the wind-dispelling herbs such as Notopterygium, vitex, levisticum, chuanxiong, and mint to expel dampness effectively—this constitutes the rightful treatment.</p>
<p>Additionally, if children consume too much sweet food, they may suffer from bad breath, toothache, and swollen eyes, with a rapid pulse indicating stomach fire, treated by dispersing yellow powder. If the liver channel is excessively damp and hot, attacking the eyes with symptoms of eye discharge and abdominal bloating, the Jiu Wei Aloe Pill is a fine remedy. For those presenting with spleen deficiency, emaciation, and lack of appetite, intermittent use of Fatty Child Pill is suggested. For those inherently weak in yin with signs of internal fire, accompanied by symptoms of heart deficiency, use little of the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Various Types of Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Consumption refers to ailments caused by excessive rich and sweet foods. Treatment should focus on regulating the spleen and stomach, dissipating accumulated heat and transforming parasites, as well as clearing heat, stopping diarrhea, and controlling dysentery, with primary reliance on Fat Child Pills and Consumption Cakes. These two remedies are effective regardless of whether the consumption is hot or cold. Generally, the disease of consumption arises from overeating, leading to accumulation in the spleen, which then transfers to other organs, resulting in the five types of consumption. What are the five types? They are related to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.</p>
<p>If consumption affects the heart, there will be a red face, dry mouth, grinding of teeth, and sores in the mouth and tongue, with body heat and emaciation; treat it with Anshen Pills. If it affects the liver, there will be a bluish face, obstruction in vision, frequent tearing, prickling headache and stiff hair, with blue veins and heat in the brain leading to debility; treat it with Liver Tonifying Decoction. If it affects the spleen, there will be a yellow face and body heat, abdominal bloating, a desire to eat dirt, undigested food with sour-smelling diarrhea, lethargy, reduced appetite, and emaciation; treat it with Yihuang Powder. If it affects the lungs, there will be a pale face, cough, breathlessness, sores in the mouth and nose, throat discomfort, abdominal heat with aversion to cold, and clear nasal discharge; treat it with Lung Clearing Decoction. If it affects the kidneys, there will be a dark face, emaciated body with sores, body heat and frequent urination, cold hands and feet, and dry mouth and nose; treat it with Dihuang Pills.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Pediatric Essentials</strong></p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>In children, all forms of malnutrition arise from the deficiency of the spleen and stomach following illness. This can occur from the excessive use of medicine, which harms their ability to digest milk and food, leading to a loss of bodily fluids and the emergence of false heat; or it may be caused by a wet nurse’s improper dietary habits and emotional stresses, which negatively affect the child. The manifestations of malnutrition differ according to the five organs, and must be identified accordingly. Despite the many symptoms, they all fundamentally relate to treatment of the five organs. For liver-related malnutrition, use Earth Huang Pills to nourish the kidneys. For heart-related malnutrition, use Calming Heart Pills for the heart and Yigong Powder to strengthen the spleen. For spleen-related malnutrition, use the Four Ingredient Fat Baby Pills and the Five Flavor Yigong Powder to enrich the earth element. For lung-related malnutrition, use Clear Lung Decoction for the lungs and Energizing Decoction to enhance the metal element. For brain-related malnutrition, also use Earth Huang Pills. For unjustly caused malnutrition, use Large Wood Plant Decoction and Toad Pills. For instances of sudden losses of energy and poor breastfeeding conditions, give Infant Pills or Large Aloe Vera Pills. For galloping malnutrition, apply Male Yellow Powder and administer Toad Pills. If symptoms like thirst, diarrhea, dysentery, swelling, or exhaustion occur, one should refer to specific prescriptions for treatment. In essence, malnutrition signifies dryness, resulting from the depletion of bodily fluids in the spleen and stomach. In children, this manifests as five types of malnutrition, while in adults it appears as five types of exhaustion, with the primary approach always focusing on balancing and nourishing the stomach energy.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Scurvy Injury</strong></p>
<p>Generally, it is mainly caused by unregulated breastfeeding, injuring the spleen and qi, leading to the descent of primordial energy, or due to the emotions and diet of the wet nurse. If the urine resembles wash water, or if the stool is pale and watery, use the Four Flavored Fertilizer Pill; if there is stagnant accumulation that is yellow and black, use the Four Noble Ingredients Decoction with added Huáng Lián (Coptis) and Mù Xiāng (Saussurea); if the complexion is green for a long time without recovery, or if combined with diarrhea or abdominal pain, use the Six Noble Ingredients Decoction with added Mù Xiāng and Sháo Yào (Peony); if urination is difficult, the stool is brown, with yellowing and shedding of the skin, or sores below the nose, use the Gardenia and Poria Decoction; if there is little milk or appetite, a swollen chest and abdomen, and frequent bowel movements, use the Four Flavored Fertilizer Pill. Additionally, carefully examine the diet and emotions of the wet nurse.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Worms</strong></p>
<p>The roundworm is one of the nine types of worms, measuring about five to six inches long. It arises from weakness of the organs and from eating rich, fatty foods. Its movements cause abdominal pain, alternating in intensity, often accompanied by drooling. If it penetrates the heart, it can be fatal; it is advised to use pills such as the &quot;Junzi Wan&quot; to expel them. Qian Zhongyang states that if there is drooling without heart pain, it indicates a cold stomach; if there is both drooling and heart pain, it is a worm-related pain, resembling epilepsy, but the eyes do not squint and the hands do not twitch. For this condition, it is prescribed to use &quot;Anchong San.&quot; Tian Shi notes that with worm pain, one may cry, fidget, or be unable to sit or lay still, often pressing on the chest and abdomen, frequently crying out, with a complexion of green and yellow, lips partly white, eyes lacking luster, and drooling. If due to a cold stomach causing vomiting, one should take &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; with five roasted Sichuan peppers and half a liang of betel nut, and decoct with &quot;Wu Mei Wan.&quot; It is said that when worms erode the upper part, there will be white spots on the upper lip; when they erode the lower part, there will be white spots on the lower lip. The various worms in the abdomen have their heads directed upwards when viewed from the front, and downwards when viewed from the back. To administer medicine, first use pig liver roasted in oil to release its aroma, allowing the child to smell it, which will make the worm&#39;s head turn upwards, facilitating the ingestion of medicine. If the Qi is weak and the worms are restless, one should simply tonify the spleen and stomach for tranquility. Master Danxi states that in winter, when expelling worms, it often indicates a deficiency of cold Qi in the stomach; the remedy is to use Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu San with two cloves of clove added.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming dynasty - Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Consumption (Gan)</strong>  </p>
<p>Consumption arises from an illness that damages the body, such as a cold that lasts five or six days and is sometimes accompanied by diarrhea. If treated excessively with cooling medicines, it can lead to spleen and stomach deficiency resulting in a decrease in bodily fluids, which in turn causes persistent thirst and generates internal heat. This internal heat consumes vitality, the muscles waste away, and other illnesses may interfere, leading to various symptoms that form the condition of consumption. Additionally, prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, or excessive improper treatment by physicians, can exacerbate the deficiency, causing agitation of bodily fluids and also leading to consumption.  </p>
<p>In children, consumption often results from the inability to properly digest milk and food, causing accumulation in the belly. Variations in temperature can lead to persistent thirst, alongside symptoms resembling cough and wheezing, similar to tidal heat. If not treated early, it will inevitably lead to labor consumption. Due to the presence of accumulated conditions, children may refuse food, resulting in spleen and stomach deficiency and the production of heat, hence the yearning for drink. Excessive drinking will wash away the spleen and stomach&#39;s essence, leading to a loss of bodily fluids which cannot transform food and water. The pulse becomes deep and thin, indicating an inability to eat and drink, leading to further deficiency in the spleen and stomach, weakness in the limbs, and the emergence of various illnesses, ultimately resulting in consumption.  </p>
<p>For children under twenty years of age, the illness is termed consumption; for those over twenty, it is termed tuberculosis. Both consumption and tuberculosis stem from deficiency of qi and blood, resulting from injury to the intestines and stomach, differing only in name. Why is this? Children have delicate organs; overconsumption easily harms them. Any disruption in diet from milk or food can seldom avoid leading to consumption. Consumption results from the imbalance in milk and food intake, excessive richness and lack of moderation.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Some infants may be deprived of milk, or they may be given porridge and rice too early, which exhausts their natural vitality and leads to the development of malnutrition; others, a few months later, may consume excessive milk and food, leading to overindulgence and malnutrition; some might indulge in sweet, fatty, sticky, or cold and salty foods, which can obstruct their digestive systems, causing malnutrition as a result; and if the wet nurse neglects proper care and the diet becomes irregular, influenced by their own emotions or exhaustion, and then they feed the child, malnutrition may be transmitted from mother to child due to the mother&#39;s condition. Is this not a case where the family cannot adjust to the illness? Malnutrition occurs when the spleen and stomach are affected, leading to a lack of bodily fluids. Some may develop it after vomiting or diarrhea from improper treatments that exhaust their bodily fluids; others may acquire it due to excessive heat and frequent diarrhea without restrictions, leading to dryness in the stomach; or because of a cold illness that has gone too far, causing thirst for water and then turning into heat, where heat has not dissipated and then is further affected by other pathogens; there are also cases of chronic cold and heat, with pain and hardness on the sides that cannot be gradually resolved, only to be harshly treated, resulting in bodily fluids being violently damaged. Is this not a case of doctors using harsh methods to treat the illness carelessly? </p>
<p>Liver malnutrition, also known as &quot;wind liver&quot; or &quot;muscle malnutrition,&quot; manifests as white membranes covering the eyes, with muscle malnutrition presenting as diarrhea with blood and weight loss, the whites of the eyes appearing blue, accompanied by itchiness, head shaking and eye rubbing, sweating profusely, a hunched posture when sleeping, pale yellow complexion, sparse hair, blue veins and heat in the brain, and sores and eczema all over the body, with accumulations in the abdomen and frequent diarrheas. Over time, if not healed, the condition worsens, leading to severe weight loss, mucky discharge from the eyes, a left side of the forehead appearing blue, or slightly yellow in the whites of the eyes, with diarrhea mixed with water, or resembling the color of moss. </p>
<p>Heart malnutrition is also called &quot;fright malnutrition.&quot;<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Pale yellow face with a red complexion, robust body with heat, sores in the mouth, strong heat with variable diarrhea, red cheeks and yellow face, chest oppression and fullness, dry nose and restlessness of the heart, sores on the tongue and mouth, chronic dysentery not healing, frequent discharge of pus and blood, sometimes night sweats, or due to fright, red and cloudy urine, heat in all five hearts, grinding teeth and relaxing the tongue, fondness for cold drinks, and a tendency to lie on the ground.</p>
<p>Spleen dysentery, also known as food dysentery. Its symptoms include inability to digest food, frequent vomiting in stomach dysentery, many tendons in the abdomen, wheezing with coarse breathing, inadequate breast milk, bloating in the heart and abdomen with frequent crying and coughing, pale yellow complexion, protruding bones with rough hair, lean physique and weak strength, chest congestion, inability to digest food and water, constant dryness of mouth and nose, unhappiness, preference for darkness and aversion to light, disharmony in intestines and stomach, frequent sour and foul diarrhea, strong craving for cold foods, excessive drinking, both body and face becoming yellow, sparse hair forming tufts, large head and small neck, abdominal bloating with weak legs, occasional fermentation leading to diarrhea, emaciation and dull eyes, cool during the day and hot at night, loss of appetite for milk and food.</p>
<p>According to Qian, fatty dysentery is the same as spleen dysentery, where the body is thin and pale yellow, dry and with sores, with varying symptoms, many different forms. Here are some examples: eye discomfort or white membranes forming, lips and body dry, yellow or black, fondness for lying on cold ground, sometimes eating dirt, body with sores and scabs, diarrhea producing green, white, or yellow foam, changing colors of dysentery, abdominal fullness, sores in both ears and nose, sparse hair appearing like tufts, large head and thin neck, extreme emaciation with strong thirst for water, all these are its symptoms.</p>
<p>This describes the symptoms of spleen dysentery, often overlapping with other forms of dysentery, since dysentery stems from the spleen meridian as its root condition, it should naturally occur together.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Lung dysentery, also known as qi dysentery, is characterized by symptoms such as wheezing, sores in the mouth and nose, coughing, reversed qi, dry and withered skin, excessive mucus and weeping, throat discomfort, rubbing the nose and biting the nails, intense heat with aversion to cold, red and itchy lips, abdominal distension, decreasing milk and food intake, irregular bowel movements with frequent diarrhea, rice-like substances in the stool, millet-like growths on the skin, redness and ulceration under the nose, thin and withered hands and feet, a fishy smell in the mouth, and a pale right cheek.</p>
<p>Kidney dysentery, also known as acute dysentery or bone dysentery, presents symptoms such as extreme emaciation, presence of sores and scabs on the body, a preference for lying on cold surfaces, black teeth and nails, emaciated muscles and bones, sores on the gums, intermittent fevers, dryness of the mouth and nose, a brain feeling like it&#39;s on fire, cold feet, increased vomiting, reduced milk and food intake, frequent diarrhea, a relaxed lower body with an inability to control the anus, itchy and painful dysentery sores, sores inside and outside both ears, legs resembling crane knees, unjoined head sutures, inability to walk, delayed tooth emergence, and foul-smelling gaps in the teeth, potentially leading to conditions like running horse dysentery.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>There is a child who has long suffered from kidney deficiency, with internal weakness and poor appetite, to the point that the cervical vertebrae are misaligned. The treatment should use Qian&#39;s Rehmannia Pill with additional remedies to expel parasites, as well as apply treatments to strengthen the muscles at the neck. If one does not recognize the symptoms and labels it as &quot;five weakness,&quot; this is incorrect. Misalignment of the cervical vertebrae can occur in three conditions: 1) prolonged vomiting and diarrhea leading to weakness; 2) liver and gallbladder heat causing a red face and tongue that suddenly changes; 3) a febrile illness that fails to vent. All of these involve wind evil entering the liver, resulting in the relaxation of muscles and tendons. For those with vomiting and diarrhea, one should regulate the stomach’s qi. For liver heat, one should cool the liver according to severity, while also applying treatments to strengthen the muscles at the neck. However, misalignment due to febrile illness is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Zhuang&#39;s Twenty-Four Indicators</p>
<p>First Indicator: purging of pus and blood, progressively losing weight, indicative of hot and cold deficiency.<br>Second Indicator: thin legs, a distended abdomen, protruding chest bones, craving for earthy and sour-salty foods, prolonged jaundice, occasional vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain, indicative of spleen deficiency.<br>Third Indicator: redness and sores beneath the nose, rubbing of the eyes accompanied by bloody diarrhea, indicative of lung deficiency. This is often due to consuming hot foods or injury to the heart and lungs from bad milk, exacerbated by coughs, and further aggravated by excessive intake of cold medicines, leading to internal heat and external cold, gradually causing confusion and frequent crying day and night.<br>Fourth Indicator: skin is thin and wrinkled, the face lacks color, the body itches and feels heated, causing irritability.<br>Fifth Indicator: sparse hair, sores on the nose, indicative of lung deficiency.<br>Sixth Indicator: sores on the head, sparse and burnt hair, indicative of liver deficiency.<br>Seventh Indicator: teeth that are yellow and reddish and inconsistent, indicative of kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The eighth condition: dry and scorched hair, sores beneath the nose, is related to lung illness. The ninth condition: biting nails, hair forming tufts, heavy limbs, is associated with heart illness. The tenth condition: tendons growing on the abdomen, tooth decay, is considered bone illness. The eleventh condition: foul-smelling gums, pale face, lack of appetite, is known as spleen illness, also called mouth illness. The twelfth condition: vomiting and abdominal swelling, is stomach illness, also known as milk illness. The thirteenth condition: a desire to lie face down, excessive sleep akin to drunkenness, abdominal swelling and breathlessness, is due to the consumption of raw meat, indicating internal parasites and is referred to as heart-spleen illness. The fourteenth condition: dryness and pain in the nose, foul breath, fresh blood at the tooth roots, is liver-lung illness. The fifteenth condition: thin legs, a protruding belly, and blue veins on the abdomen, is spleen illness.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>16th sign: Sores appear out of season, a preference for cold water, indicates heat dysentery.<br>17th sign: Grains on the skin, rice in feces, indicates cold spleen dysentery.<br>18th sign: Abdominal fullness and bloating, along with dry mouth, indicates heart and stomach dysentery.<br>19th sign: A desire for uncooked rice, flour, charcoal, and bricks, indicates spleen and stomach dysentery.<br>20th sign: Rubbing the nose and wiping the eyes, biting nails, and a thirst for water, indicates liver thirst dysentery.<br>21st sign: Alternating chills and heat, a desire to lie down and not get up, indicates bone heat dysentery.<br>22nd sign: A desire for water, eyes that won&#39;t open, indicates liver dysentery.<br>23rd sign: The body either hot or cold, constant thirst, indicates acute dysentery.<br>24th sign: Dark gums, lips that are sluggish to part, and red when opened, indicate heart dysentery with accumulated heat.<br>In children with internal dysentery, dry eyes, abdominal bloating, inconsistent stool color, or resembling watery sediment, gradually losing weight, this condition can be treated.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If there are sores and redness under the nose from rubbing, with pain and itching on the tip of the nose where scabs form, gradually causing discharge that runs to the ears, accompanied by red eyes, sparse hair, tight scalp, a large head with a thin neck, and a frail body, it can still be treated. If the lips and mouth are eroded, the gums display five colors or are completely black, with white sores under the tongue, holes in the palate, and persistent foul breath, gradually leading to decay of the gums, it can still be treated. If the lower body is open and occasionally reddens with unbearable itching, and there is irregular diarrhea, it can still be treated. If there are symptoms of malnutrition affecting the spine, with itchiness in all ten fingers leading to biting the nails, hair becoming tufted, the spine feeling like saw teeth, with occasional abdominal bloating and irregular diarrhea, prompt treatment will lead to recovery. </p>
<p>For children with liver malnutrition, if the eyes show blue veins, there is hardness under the left rib, frequent salivation, and blackness at the corners of the eyes, they cannot be treated. For heart malnutrition, if the child is frequently startled and cries, loves drinking water, prefers spicy food, has a pulse near the ears, and black spots on the tongue, it cannot be treated.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Spleen deficiency indicates a large abdomen, pale lips lacking blood color, a flat and full philtrum, excessive diarrhea, inability to digest food and water, a craving for dirt, dry skin, and exposed bones; such a condition is untreatable. Lung deficiency presents with coughing, shortness of breath, frequent white frothy diarrhea, skin lesions resembling corn, and a dark coloration; this condition is also untreatable. Kidney deficiency manifests as a craving for sour and salty foods, excessive thirst, milky urine, dark blue-black teeth, dryness in ears and brain, hunched shoulders, and emaciated bones; this is likewise untreatable. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are five signs of deficiency: </p>
<ol>
<li>Pain unnoticed at the base of the middle toe; </li>
<li>Weakness in hands and feet, drooping and lax; </li>
<li>Persistent illness with coldness throughout the body; </li>
<li>Continuous output of green saliva and foam from the internal organs; </li>
<li>Weakness in the tendons and muscles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions like these are all untreatable. When using medicine, careful examination is essential. </p>
<p>Deficiency refers to a chronic illness in children, often resulting from prolonged vomiting and diarrhea. Medical practitioners may mistakenly administer inappropriate drugs, causing imbalance between deficiency and excess in the child, leading to stomach weakness and loss of bodily fluids, internal heat, and muscle wastage. If one organ is weak, all will be affected. Symptoms include swollen eyelids, abdominal distention, inconsistent diarrhea, and gradual weight loss, making recovery unlikely. This indicates the presence of wind accumulation in the intestines and stomach, which should be treated by dispersing the wind and guiding it out, followed by nourishing the corresponding organ.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Zhu Zazheng</p>
<p>To counter heat, coolness is applied; to counter cold, warmth is applied; to balance both heat and cold, a combination of warming and cooling is utilized; this is the essence of it. Heat-related sickness often manifests externally, with symptoms such as red sores below the nose, wet itching sores on the head, restlessness of the five hearts, rough breathing when lifting the clothes, thirst for cold water, irritability while lying on the ground, a hot belly but cold feet, and intermittent tidal fever; all these are signs of heat-related illness. Cold-related sickness typically manifests internally, with unpredictable bowel movements, greenish-white diarrhea, weak limbs, swollen eyes, and a dark complexion. Additionally, there may be dryness and thirst while lying down, resembling heat, yet with an inability to intake food and constant diarrhea; this also indicates cold-related illness. If there is excessive diarrhea with pus and blood, leading to increasing weakness, it is termed a cold-heat illness. Generally, the cause of such illnesses is deficiency. Heat arises from internal deficiency of heat, while cold arises from internal deficiency of cold. When treating heat, one must not excessively cool; when treating cold, one must not sharply warm or swiftly replenish. Thus, Qian also states: children are easily affected by deficiency or excess. The spleen&#39;s deficiency cannot tolerate cold or heat; taking cold substances results in further cold, while taking warm substances leads to added heat; it is essential to recognize this to avoid errors. Is this not a fundamental principle for the young? The superior physician addresses this by dissolving accumulation, harmonizing the stomach, nourishing the blood, and regulating the qi, adhering to suitable medicines to support the patient, with light and simple diet for nourishment, ensuring harmony between the nourishing and protecting forces, allowing the organs to be naturally full. Any excess in this regard, and the gentleman cannot guarantee its success. The methods of treating accumulation must also be carefully weighed.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Accumulation is the root of consumption; it is called consumption when it becomes extreme due to accumulation. Those who have accumulation will always have a hot abdomen and cold feet, so one must carefully assess the condition of fullness and emptiness to treat them accordingly. If the accumulation leads to severe emptiness, then one should first support the stomach to ensure its energy is full, and then apply mildly purgative treatments. If accumulation is stronger than emptiness, then one should first use laxatives to promote a discharge, and urgently administer tonic medications to support the emptiness.</p>
<p>While it is appropriate to use laxatives to treat accumulation, one should not neglect remedies like cardamom, radish seeds, dried ginger, and herbs that dissolve accumulations. Pain in the sides or abdomen is also considered a form of accumulation within emptiness; it usually starts cold and later turns hot. Patients may experience coughing or wheezing due to drinking water, and there is a theory regarding accumulation causing tidal heat. Treatment should address both the cold and hot conditions and also include laxatives. </p>
<p>Considering these signs and symptoms, it is clear that the onset of the condition varies, and the methods of treatment are not uniform—thus one must exercise discretion in handling these cases! Generally, the illness of consumption arises from overeating and drinking, leading to accumulations within the spleen; if left untreated, these can affect the remaining organs and cause the five types of consumption diseases. If the spleen&#39;s issue is resolved, the other organs will also stabilize, but neglecting treatment for an extended period will inevitably lead to changes in the condition.</p>
<p>For spleen-related illnesses, one may use aloe pills, sandalwood-betel nut pills, or crystal elixirs and black rhinoceros pills, paying close attention to the balance of fullness and emptiness in treatment. For those with parasites, one may use the gentleman&#39;s pill or anti-parasitic decoction. For abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting clear fluids, indicating that the parasites are expelling downwards, one may frequently administer the two saint pills.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>All types of malnutrition should appropriately use the formula &quot;Wugan Baotong Wan&quot; or &quot;Cheng Wanying Wan&quot; for regular consumption to resolve accumulation and treat malnutrition. Additionally, one should apply formulas to balance the corresponding organs: for calming the mind, use &quot;Fushen Decoction&quot;; for regulating the liver, use &quot;Qiguai Decoction&quot;; for regulating the spleen, use &quot;Shenling Baizhu Powder&quot;; for supplementing the lungs, use &quot;Bulei Powder&quot;; for nourishing the kidneys, use &quot;Tiaoyuan Powder.&quot; If each treatment is suitable, the previous symptoms should not recur.</p>
<p>Accumulation is the mother of malnutrition; thus, if accumulation is not treated, it leads to malnutrition. Furthermore, if accumulation is not eliminated and remains while the organs are deficient, it severely worsens malnutrition. Generally, the malnutrition that children suffer from involves diarrhea at all times without the occurrence of wind symptoms. Only malnutrition-related diarrhea is named hot diarrhea, as the movement of the organs is limited, hence wind symptoms do not develop. Although there is no wind-induced diarrhea, it can transform into other symptoms: excessive thirst due to deficiency heat, agitation accompanied by diarrhea, abdominal swelling and shortness of breath are all indications of deficiency in malnutrition.</p>
<p>As the ancients said: when malnutrition is of deficient type, it should be supplemented, recognizing that malnutrition is a disease, and one should not further stimulate the organs. At the onset, it is called &quot;malnutrition qi.&quot; When the abdomen is distended and tense, it is termed &quot;malnutrition deficiency.&quot; Frequent diarrhea and dysentery are called &quot;malnutrition accumulation.&quot; A feeling of five hearts being weak and troubled is called &quot;malnutrition heat.&quot; Hair thinning and loss of vitality, a distended abdomen with visible veins, and a craving for unusual substances are called &quot;malnutrition extreme&quot; [indicating that the disease has reached a serious point]. Heat manifesting in fluctuations and the body being emaciated, with a lackluster complexion and pallor is termed &quot;malnutrition fatigue.&quot;<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>The hands and feet are small, the neck is long and bony, the buttocks lack flesh, the abdomen is swollen and the navel protrudes, known as Dingxi. After eating, there is vomiting; the skull seems divided; there is thirst leading to drinking; worms come out of the mouth, called Bulu. All these are symptoms of malnutrition (gan). Additionally, due to excessive consumption of raw, cold, sweet, sticky, greasy foods, stagnation accumulates in the middle, failing to digest, leading to malnutrition over time. </p>
<p>To treat malnutrition, one must assess the severity of symptoms, regulate the organs, harmonize the middle, and ensure the three burners function well, allowing the stomach&#39;s energy to be warm and to accept food. Strengthening the spleen enhances digestion, causing the organs to naturally adjust, enabling the blood and qi to interact, and fortifying both muscle strength and bone strength, leading to clarity of spirit and vitality. This aids in the elimination of malnutrition and expulsion of worms, gradually leading to recovery.</p>
<p>However, if one attacks the internal organs with medicine, displacing the intestines and stomach, forcing out accumulated toxins and worms, this may be called medical treatment, yet it is not a genuine approach. An infant&#39;s organs are weak, making them prone to worms; weakness leads to stagnation, malnutrition, and fullness—what good is purging then? If one continues this cycle, the intestines and stomach become weak, resulting in malnutrition, turning the symptoms to weakness, making it impossible to save an innocent child.</p>
<p>If the symptoms are numerous and cannot be classified as a specific type of malnutrition, one should consult the various general treatment methods for malnutrition. If specific symptoms correspond to those of the five types of malnutrition, one should refer to the original treatment methods to differentiate between cold, heat, deficiency, and excess, using them accordingly. It is essential to understand this well to avoid errors.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Liver Illness</strong></p>
<p>Liver illness is caused by improper diet, leading to heat in the liver. If the wet nurse fails to regulate temperature, indulges in flavors, or if the infant suffers from external wind and cold, combined with internal emotions of joy and anger, lingering evil qi can lead to the infant developing wind illness. The liver corresponds to the eyes; heat may accumulate in the upper diaphragm, causing phlegm and dampness, resulting in wind entering the eyes, causing redness, swelling, and obstructions, along with pus and tears that irritate the eyes, leading to pain, itchiness, and rubbing, which can result in dimness or even blindness, known as “eye illness.” External symptoms include shaking the head and rubbing the eyes, a white membrane covering the eyes, blue discoloration, excessive tears, a hot head with hair standing up, blue veins, a hot brain, itching on the nails, spasms in the tendons, dryness, thirst, excessive sweating, and diarrhea with sores. Qian recommends the Di Huang Pill for treatment, Yang advocates the Tian Ma Pill and cooked/raw Di Huang Decoction, and Zeng employs the Qi Gui Decoction for liver regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Illness</strong></p>
<p>This is also caused by improper diet, resulting in heat in the heart. The blood and qi are unstable; improper nursing leads to stasis and internal heat, which has not been resolved, thus causing the heart to be disturbed and resulting in symptoms of anxiety and shock. External symptoms include a strong fever throughout the body, a red face and lips, oral ulcers, chest discomfort, red and scanty urine, heat in the palms and soles, night sweats with thirst, and a fragile, startled expression. Qian recommends the An Shen Pill for treatment. Xue uses the An Shen Pill for heart issues and Yi Gong Powder to supplement the spleen; Yang suggests the Fu Ling Pill and Qian&#39;s An Shen Pill; Zeng employs the Fu Shen Decoction for calming the heart.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Spleen Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This occurs due to irregularities in milk and food intake, causing damage to the spleen and stomach. This may be caused by a wet nurse consuming excessively cold or rich food, or by overfeeding the infant, or by vomiting after milk consumption. Prolonged sleep after excessive milk intake may lead to milk lumps, and abdominal distension with lumps in the sides is also considered a milk abscess. External symptoms include a yellowish face, fever, a distended belly, weakness in the legs, vomiting and fullness, lethargy and crying, inability to digest food, and sour-smelling diarrhea. This condition is treated with Qian&#39;s Yi Huang San. Yang&#39;s method involves using Ling Zhi Wan in conjunction with Yi Huang San; Xue&#39;s approach uses Si Wei Fei Er Wan for abscess treatment and Wu Wei Yi Gong San for generating earth; Zeng&#39;s method adjusts the spleen with Shen Ling Bai Zhu San.</p>
<p><strong>Lung Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This arises from unregulated milk and food, causing obstruction and heat damaging the lungs. The lungs govern qi, and the nose is connected to the lungs. If the qi is unbalanced, wind and dampness can invade the skin and enter the blood vessels. Consequently, the area around the nose may develop red, itchy, damp sores, known as nasal abscesses. These sores are painless; where fluid flows can lead to ulceration, also referred to as an abscess (obscured upper and lower worms). External symptoms include coughing, wheezing, strong fever with chills, skin eruptions, nasal sores with discharge, sore throat, bloody saliva, abdominal distension with fine hair, and frequent diarrhea. Qian&#39;s treatment focuses on tonifying the spleen to generate the lungs, using Yi Huang San; Yang&#39;s method employs Qing Fei Yin Hua (obscured upper and lower worms) Wan, with Qian&#39;s E Jiao San also applied; Xue utilizes Qing Fei Yin for lung treatment, and Yi Qi Tang for generating gold; Zeng&#39;s approach uses Bu Fei San.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Shen Gan (Kidney Heat)</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from improper diet and the accumulation of heat in the internal organs. Sweet flavors enter the spleen and stimulate parasitic worms. When these worms are active, they invade the internal organs, leading to disturbances and discomfort in children&#39;s hearts. If the condition affects the mouth and gums, oral sores may bleed, and the teeth may turn purple-black; if it erodes the intestines and kidneys, there may be dysentery and anal ulcers, with湿 (dampness) causing itching and sores. If treatment is not initiated early, the essence and marrow can be depleted, making recovery difficult. These parasites (the upper ones hide and the lower ones burrow) are associated with dampness; they are often a result of prolonged diarrhea and damage from chronic illness to the intestines and stomach, resembling symptoms from dietary excess or cold damage leading to tooth decay, sometimes referred to metaphorically as &#39;running horse.&#39;</p>
<p>Teeth relate to the kidneys, which govern weakness. If they are exposed to pathogenic heat, the heat energy drives upwards to the upper jiao (the area of the thorax), hence the metaphor of &#39;running horse.&#39; Initially, foul breath is termed &quot;stinking breath;&quot; subsequently, teeth darken, known as &quot;crumbling sand;&quot; when severe, the gums rot, referred to as &quot;decaying troughs;&quot; if hot blood spurts out, it is termed &quot;expressed leakage;&quot; in extreme cases, all teeth may fall out, denoted as &quot;rotten roots.&quot; Once the roots have decayed, even if one survives, the teeth do not regrow. </p>
<p>External symptoms include brain heat and muscle wasting, hands and feet feeling icy, alternating chills and fever, abdominal pain with slippery diarrhea, foul breath, gum sores, black nails, a sallow face, and numerous skin sores or scabies. </p>
<p>The Qian family&#39;s Di Huang Wan (Rehmannia Pill) is used to treat this condition; it should also include more Huang Qi (Astragalus) in Shen Mai San (Pulse-Strengthening Powder) to tonify the lungs. The Zeng family&#39;s Tiao Yuan San (Regulating Origin Powder) is also applied.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Hot and Cold Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The new form of dysentery is hot dysentery, characterized by a yellow complexion, flushed face, bone heat with night sweats, dry nose and foul breath, chapped lips with extreme thirst, irritability, and restlessness. If dysentery persists for a long time, it becomes cold dysentery, which presents with swollen eyes, abdominal distension, variable diarrhea with greasy stools, sometimes resembling oil drops, accompanied by thirst, yellowing, and emaciation. Hot dysentery tends to manifest externally, while cold dysentery primarily affects the internal. There are also cases where symptoms of hot and cold dysentery interact, neither new nor old, not purely external nor purely internal.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Innocent Illness</strong></p>
<p>The child&#39;s face is pale, the hair is straight, and they often have a fever. Their appetite does not nourish their skin and flesh, and over time, this leads to death, which is called &quot;innocent illness.&quot; It is said that in the heavens there is a bird named Innocent, which hides by day and roams by night, washing the clothes and bedding of children, exposing them overnight. This bird flies down from above, takes the clothes, and covers the child with them, causing the child to develop this illness.</p>
<p>For children with &quot;innocent illness,&quot; there is a hard lump at the back of the head like a bullet. Pressing it causes it to rotate downwards. Whenever a child has this lump, like a pest under the tongue of livestock, if not removed promptly, it often leads to death. This lump initially forms soft and painless, containing a bug like rice flour; it grows larger with warmth. When it becomes large, it hardens, and the bug spreads with the blood and qi, causing blockages. The mother bug and offspring harm the organs, leading to sores on the skin and possibly purulent blood in the stool.</p>
<p>As a result, the child gradually becomes yellow and emaciated, with a large head and frail limbs, leading to premature death. Thus, children suffering from this disease have swollen bellies with purulent blood diarrhea, their hair and skin become dry and withered, and their bodies continue to weaken. Their intestines and stomach are already weak, experiencing diarrhea at all times, hence the name &quot;innocent illness and diarrhea.&quot;<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Mr. Wang of Han Dong said: When a child suffers from illness due to unwarranted reasons, it is said in ancient texts that there is a bird in the heavens named &quot;Wugū.&quot; This bird, while drying a child’s clothing, passes urine on it if it is left out overnight, causing the child to cry and resulting in various ailments, leading to gradual yellowing and emaciation. This is not the case; rather, it is due to the harm caused by the eight evils. The eight evils are hunger, satiety, labor, fatigue, wind, fright, heat, and accumulation. They are known as the eight evils. Over time, this leads to gradual yellowing and emaciation, lack of nourishment despite eating, crying at night, a slight fever, excessive thirst, inability to sense hunger or satiety, and possibly developing sores or skin diseases.</p>
<p>In a song of eight verses by the Zhu family: The child&#39;s unwarranted energy often results from the mother&#39;s actions. If one can take care and be cautious, how could they witness such emaciation? Fright causes wind-related ailments, and warmth and cold create energy depletion. It is necessary to avoid sickly milk and not to overdress. Meals should not be rushed; speech should not be feared for its lateness. Discussing the eight prohibitions, the chest feels weak and heavy. The scalp is shiny and bare, with sparse hair. Liver stagnation affects the eyes, while spleen deficiency leads to yellowing in limbs. The entire body develops itchy rashes, and there are sores all over. Diarrhea and dysentery are relentless, with fluctuations in temperature. The embroidered ball is neglected, and how can a bamboo horse be ridden? By day, the eyes reveal a dull sheen, and drool hangs from the mouth. Toothed teeth must bite down, and raised hands need to push the brows. Each night they consume fruits, and each morning they eat dirt. The stomach harms the intestines, leading to bloating, and the lungs are filled, causing doubt in breath. Meals are unceasing, with sleep resembling intoxication.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Worms</strong></p>
<p>If the condition of malnutrition persists and does not improve, there will be worms in the abdomen, the body will appear yellow and emaciated, and diarrhea will be continuous. It is advisable to take medicine to expel them, and as the malnutrition decreases, the symptoms will gradually diminish.</p>
<p><strong>Roundworm Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>Jade Verse: Constant crying with phlegm and green roundworms, salivation creates cold pain that is hard to endure. Every meal of sweet foods and seasonal fruits leads to the growth of worms and deepens the illness. First, use Aristolochia powder and Aloe pills to expel the roundworms, then warm the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>The body shows signs of heat, sometimes aversion to cold, the tongue is dry and the mouth parched, excessive sleep with night sweats, skin is dry, hair stands and becomes burnt, though there is much dairy and food, the muscles waste away, limbs feel weak, and there is a tendency to sleep in a daze. As time passes, the condition worsens, leading to further debilitation; this is the symptom.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Internal Canker</strong></p>
<p>For children, if milk and food do not digest, with a feeling of emptiness and swelling in the heart and abdomen, eyes that are red and itchy, body heat and dry skin, digestive irregularities, diarrhea with five colors, gradually becoming emaciated, and worms eroding the rectum, it becomes more severe with time. The diarrhea does not cease, hence the term &quot;internal canker.&quot; This is a cold syndrome and it is advisable to use Junzi pill.</p>
<p><strong>External Canker</strong></p>
<p>If the canker is external, it results in redness and ulceration beneath the nose, sores at the tip of the nose that do not scab, and sores developing around the ears. Now I will categorize and list &quot;running horse canker,&quot; &quot;oral canker,&quot; &quot;nasal canker,&quot; &quot;ocular canker,&quot; etc., as follows. </p>
<p>Running horse canker is the most severe form of canker, marked by the internal organs steaming with heat and attacking upwards, leading to a collapse akin to sand falling. The flesh at the edges of the teeth rots, the mouth emits a foul odor, there is a slight fever in the body, inability to eat, fresh blood oozing from the gaps between teeth, and the teeth feel shaky as if they are about to fall out, with the flesh rotting and falling away. </p>
<p>To treat it, first rinse the mouth with a mild saltwater solution, then administer Zijing powder mixed in, three times a day, to eliminate the worms at the edges of the teeth. If the condition is severe, apply Qiuchuang powder mixed in, then adjust with vermilion ointment and ox gall ointment combined with Tianzhu yellow powder, following the method of Master Mao. Alternatively, using Tianzhu yellow powder mixed with dihuang ointment is also effective, according to the method of Huiyan. </p>
<p>With such adjustments, the patient will be stable. If the condition does not improve and one to three teeth begin to fall out, the patient may not recover. Over time, the face will look gaunt, the cheeks will become hollow, and the patient may cease to live.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The treatment of initial symptoms with a retreat of wind-heat from the spleen and lungs should involve taking Betel Nut Powder in five to seven doses, followed by applying this medicine to the gums. Take a large jujube, remove the pit, and place a small amount of arsenic inside, then burn it to ash for application. Before sleeping, apply it to the gums several times for effectiveness.</p>
<p>Those experiencing this condition often suffer from qi deficiency due to cold, along with stagnation of retained food that does not pass, leading to accumulated warmth becoming heat. The deficiency heat rises and can be aggravated by consuming sweet, sour, salty, or greasy foods. Although the spleen enjoys sweetness, prolonged stagnation can trap heat that ascends to the mouth, causing teeth to become blackened and rotten, sometimes discharging clear blood. When blood accumulates, it may turn into pus that becomes foul and leads to dental erosion, even resulting in the cheeks being perforated. This follows with difficulties in eating dairy or other foods, a bright yet floating complexion, shortness of breath and heat, collectively termed &quot;Running Horse Sore.&quot;</p>
<p>The method for treating this involves first eliminating the accumulated heat with a combination of Angelica Powder and Three-sided Powder, decocted with water, ginger, and jujubes for consumption. Next, administer Aloe Vera Pills, Jade Dew Decoction, and rinse with warm salt water. Alternatively, wash with a soft chicken feather dipped in salt water, then lightly dry, followed by applying Burnt Salt Powder, Inner Gold Powder, and Mithradate Powder.</p>
<p>If the condition does not improve over time, apply the treatment above and below the lips. If it progresses to a collapsing sand syndrome or leads to perforation of the cheeks, dislocated teeth, and exposed bone, along with reduced intake and wheezing, it will certainly lead to a dangerous state.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Mouth rot presents with symptoms such as itching and pain in the lips, blackened teeth, ulcers on the tongue, dry heat in the brain, red and rotten gums, swollen cheeks and toothaches, and foul breath due to the invasion of heat poison. This is a mild and slow form of the condition known as &quot;running horse rot.&quot; The &quot;Sacred Wisdom&quot; describes it as excessive. Treatment should focus on clearing the stomach with formulas like Qingwei San and Ganlu Yin taken internally, while externally, one can use fried black myrobalan, green vitriol burnt red, and a small amount of human-centered white, applied with a bit of borneol to wipe the teeth, or adding betel nut powder to kill parasites is also acceptable.</p>
<p>For nasal rot, the symptoms include poor adjustment of dairy and food in children, causing stagnation in the upper body and allowing rot worms to erode the nose. Symptoms include redness and itching in the nose, strong fever with excessive crying, dry and brittle skin, emaciation, cough with difficulty breathing, irregular diarrhea, and sores at the nostrils and lips, hence it is called nasal rot.</p>
<p>The illness of damp rot often results from prolonged diarrhea and weak spleen and stomach, where worms in the intestines erode the five organs, causing distress and irritation. If the erosion occurs above, there will be ulcers in the mouth, nose, and gums; if below, the anus will be injured and rotten, making treatment difficult. This can also arise from long-term dysentery, internal heat causing excessive sleepiness, or a preference for sweet foods, which enables the worms to thrive and leads to this condition.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Children have a strong desire for sweet flavors, which often leads to the movement of various worms in the stomach and intestines, resulting in the erosion of the internal organs; this is akin to &quot;upper concealment and lower worms.&quot; Generally, all five flavors enter the stomach, and their essence returns according to the tastes of the organs. The spleen and stomach are interrelated and are both associated with earth. Sweetness, being soft and moist, nourishes the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are nourished, the worms become active; when they are active, they cause erosion resulting in &quot;gan&quot; (a disease). Since the worms are stimulated by sweetness, it is named &quot;gan.&quot; If the worms erode the lower part, sores will develop at the anus, and in severe cases, the child may die within days, necessitating urgent treatment.</p>
<p>If young children have irregular feeding habits, with improper combinations of hot and cold, they can harm their internal organs and lead to the &quot;gan qi&quot; (the essence of gan). When the spleen and stomach are weak, breastfeeding becomes ineffective, leading to a weak and cold large intestine, resulting in diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea can cause both the intestines and stomach to weaken, allowing dampness to invade, worms to move internally, and cause erosion of the lower parts; this is called &quot;gan li shi&quot; (gan with dampness).</p>
<p>Gan sores appear on the face and nose of children; they are neither itchy nor painful and often produce a discharge. Where the discharge flows, sores quickly form. These sores can also appear on other parts of the body, which is common in children and results from the clash of wind and dampness with the blood and qi; hence, they are not itchy or painful, which is why they are named &quot;gan sores.&quot;<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Five Types of Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>The Copper Wall Mountain Man said: In treating malnutrition, it is not necessary to categorize into five types; rather, if there is deficiency, then tonify; if there is heat, then clear; if there is cold, then warm. If there is vomiting, treat the vomiting; if there is diarrhea, treat the diarrhea; if there is accumulation, treat the accumulation; if there are worms, treat the worms. One should simply use the recipe for the Gathered Sage Pills, adjusting as needed; it has been repeatedly tested and proven effective.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Heat</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wang from the East Han discusses the condition of children who experience fevers, show emaciation, have increased thirst, consume food without gaining muscle. This condition is termed malnutrition heat. For malnutrition heat, one should take the Digestive Pills, and intermittently take the Pest Suppressing Pills; afterward, take the Turtle Shell Powder to resolve the fever, followed by the Fat Infant Pills.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>This refers to malnutrition characterized by symptoms such as scorching heat and bone fever, along with cough and night sweats. The medicinal formulas Tang&#39;s Turtle Shell Powder and Pig Stomach Pills are used to address these symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms include a face with a bluish-yellow tint, emaciation, abdominal swelling, erect hair, and body heat, along with slight abdominal pain. This condition arises from severe malnutrition leading to such symptoms. For treatment, first use the Harmonizing Qi Powder and the Awakening the Spleen Powder for two days to regulate. Then administer the Qingjindan to eliminate malnutrition accumulation, followed by the Harmonizing Qi and Awakening the Spleen Powders for nourishment. Regular use of the Baotong Pill will lead to recovery. The &quot;Jade Secrets&quot; states that with malnutrition and abdominal distension with tidal heat, first provide stomach harmonizing treatments, then administer medicines to eliminate excess, followed by malnutrition medications.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>First, use Qingjindan to remove malnutrition accumulation, and then employ Harmonizing Qi Powder, Xianglian Powder, and Ruixiang Powder for regulation. Once diarrhea stops, continue with Baotong Pill. The &quot;Shibi Classic&quot; mentions that malnutrition diarrhea is caused by careless eating or consuming spoiled milk. There may be pieces in the abdomen or lumps resembling eggs, which can contribute to loose stools like gruel, coarse hair, a dull complexion, or a bluish-yellow tint, with eyes often looking squinted. It is crucial to divide food and drink, and gentle medications should suffice for recovery. If the medicine is too hot, it will cause swelling and death. Diarrhea with increased appetite indicates parasitic malnutrition, and anti-parasitic medicine is recommended; while diarrhea with reduced appetite suggests cold malnutrition, thus warm medicine is advisable.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p>
<h3>Deficiency and Emaciation</h3>
<p>If the maternal energy is insufficient, the body becomes extremely emaciated. When children are emaciated and lack flesh, it is due to the disharmony of the spleen and stomach, preventing them from properly digesting food, resulting in weak blood and energy that cannot nourish the skin. Those with heat will exhibit warmth and slightly yellow muscles, while those with cold will often have diarrhea and pale lips. </p>
<p>Children who have suffered from severe illnesses, such as convulsions, typhoid, or severe warmth, and have taken medicine or undergone purging or sweating, may still have weakened energy and blood after recovery. Their spleen and stomach remain weak, preventing them from transforming and transporting food energy to nourish the body, leading to emaciation.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to carefully observe their physical appearance and symptoms. For instance, a flushed face and excessive crying indicate heart deficiency; a pale face and sunken eyes suggest liver deficiency; swelling before and behind the ears or below them indicates deficient liver fire; a lump of flesh in the neck signals food accumulation and deficient heat; a yellowish face with fullness indicates spleen deficiency; a pale face with shortness of breath denotes lung deficiency; and white eyes indicate kidney deficiency. </p>
<p>One must also consider the interplay of elements in treatment. Additionally, distinguishing between cold and heat is crucial. If there is abdominal pain with clear-white diarrhea, no thirst, and a preference for warmth, this indicates a cold condition, and even in summer, one should use wood fragrance pills. If there is body heat, restlessness, yellow diarrhea, thirst, and a preference for cold, this indicates a heat condition, and even in winter, one should use Hu Huanglian pills. The treatment should prioritize symptoms over the seasons.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Dingxi</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as Dingxi in children, particularly in those who are ill, is caused by excessive feeding, which leads to weakness in the spleen and stomach, preventing proper digestion. If food is not digested, the essence of water and grain is diminished, resulting in insufficient nourishment for the qi and blood, leading to emaciated muscles. The symptoms include a swollen abdomen, a thin neck, and a yellowish pallor. If not treated for a long time, it can evolve into conditions like food stagnation and malnutrition, all classified under the name Dingxi, which encompasses three similar conditions with varying severity.</p>
<p>In general, if a child has been vomiting and experiencing diarrhea for an extended period without recovery, or if they are bedridden and have large knees with thin shins, this is also referred to as Dingxi. If the child is under seven years old, it is called &quot;drumstick wind,&quot; and if under fifteen, it is termed &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; These conditions are all attributed to wind-cold injuring the kidneys, as the kidneys govern the bones.</p>
<p>When distinguishing between conditions like malnutrition (gan zhang) and Dingxi, it is noted that if the child&#39;s abdomen is swollen and veins are visibly prominent, it is called gan zhang. If there are no visible veins, it is named Dingxi, arising from overfeeding that injures the stomach. Dingxi is a long-accumulating condition similar to malnutrition, primarily caused by excessive eating that harms the spleen and stomach, resulting in their weakness. Without sufficient digestion, food intake decreases, leading to insufficient generation of qi and blood.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The face is pale and dreadful, with heat and cold alternately affecting the body. The abdomen is large with prominent veins, the hands and feet resemble tubes, the skull has an open crown, the neck is small and the body is yellow and thin. First, administer the universal remedy pill; then, give a dose of ginseng, poria, and white atractylodes powder in the morning to nourish the stomach qi. Afterward, take the cream of clarified butter powder before meals, and after eating, administer three to five black rhinoceros pills to aid the spleen in transforming food. This method is based on the technique of welcoming and seizing. Intermittently include the spleen-awakening powder, areca nut and cardamom pill, and wood fragrance and rhizome pill to gradually restore balance. If there is thirst, diarrhea, or abdominal pain, the Qianjin balm is also good. If the spleen qi becomes slightly harmonious, and food intake gradually increases, continue with the transformation pill and the happy pill regularly. Alternatively, use the black rhinoceros pill sparingly to regulate the qi and stop replenishment. For alternating chills and fever, the Chaihu decoction is the primary treatment. For abdominal distension, use the Nansheng abdominal skin powder. If there is excess heat, prepare an infusion of barley sprouts and willow branches, with the Three Resolution Powder for relief. For worms, use the Shijunzi pill. This illness does not arise in a day, and the treatment method must gradually bring about recovery; seeking quick results is difficult. Avoid chicken, alcohol, sheep, wheat, fish, vinegar, sweet, cold, and toxic substances.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Biting Dew</strong></p>
<p>Biting Dew occurs because milk feeding is excessive, leading to a weakened spleen and stomach, gradually resulting in an inability to eat, diminished blood and energy, and a lack of nourishment to the muscles. The bones become thin and emaciated, suffering from bitter heat. It is called Biting Dew, and it is advisable to take a pill with musk for nourishment. </p>
<p>Biting Dew also arises from an unregulated milk feeding that harms the spleen and stomach. When these organs are damaged, appetite decreases, leading to a thin and emaciated appearance, and the energy of the internal organs cannot circulate properly. When heat arises over time, it is referred to as Biting Dew. This condition is not far from Ding Xi; however, there is excessive vomiting after eating, internal energy is deficient and cold, and there is boundless diarrhea with worms in the stool. The treatment method is the same as for Ding Xi, but with the addition of nourishing the internal organs soup for consumption.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Medical Essentials: Twelve Innocent Illnesses</strong></p>

<p>Childhood malnutrition has many discussions, but the concept of the &quot;Five Types of Malnutrition&quot; is the most accurate. The symptoms vary externally, but they all correspond to the five internal organs. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Liver Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include shaking the head and rubbing the eyes, a white membrane covering the eyes, excessive sweating all over the body, a preference for covering the face while sleeping, itchy and watery eyes, a blue-yellow complexion, hair standing upright and dry, blue veins with heat in the head, abdominal distention, frequent diarrhea, and gradual emaciation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Heart Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include a sensation of overall heat, red cheeks with a yellow face, restlessness and fullness in the chest, mouth sores, excessive night sweats, frequent diarrhea with pus and blood, and a diminished spirit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spleen Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include a distended belly like a drum with visible veins, shortness of breath and rough breathing, a feeling of fullness in the abdomen, frequent crying and coughing, inability to digest food, dry lips and mouth, a craving for dirt, unhappiness in moods, aversion to light and preference for darkness, frequent sour-smelling diarrhea, internal muscle waste, weakened physical condition, and in severe cases, abdominal protrusion.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lung Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include a cough with reversed breathing, hair loss, difficulty in the throat, rubbing the nose and biting nails, mouth and nose sores, abdominal bloating, inability to ingest milk or food, bowel irregularities, inconsistent diarrhea, aversion to cold with a chilled body, rice grains in stool, and white discharge from the lower body.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>The fifth type is kidney deficiency (腎疳), characterized by upper heat and lower cold, intermittent chills and fevers, mouth sores, scorching ears and a heated head, cold extremities, vomiting and diarrhea, worms in the lower part of the body (with anus prolapsing), excessive nighttime crying, and gradually increasing weakness, which if severe, leads to bone degeneration. Children&#39;s deficiency diseases resemble adult consumption, hence it is also called &#39;deficiency consumption.&#39; Adult consumption occurs due to kidney damage and a decline in essence; children&#39;s deficiency arises from spleen damage and depletion of fluids. If the illness persists, all five organs become affected. Adults with consumption have weakened bones and depleted energy; children with deficiency have swollen abdomens and weakened spirits. The differences at the onset of the illness stem from how the organs receive and transmit the problems. However, with prolonged illness, the damage to all five organs becomes uniform. Therefore, the five losses are: the first loss is to the skin (毛), leading to hair loss, associated with the lungs; the second loss is to the blood vessels, with deficiency preventing nourishment of the organs, related to the heart; the third loss is to the muscles, weakening them and inhibiting nourishment from food, linked to the spleen; the fourth loss is to the tendons, which become relaxed and unable to contract, associated with the liver; the fifth loss is to the bones, leading to inability to rise from bed, related to the kidneys. When the illness is at its worst, flesh sinks down and bones decay, ultimately leading to death. In general, when children are ill, it often results from damage to the upper and lower parts of the body.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>Children have delicate and soft organs, making them prone to both deficiency and excess. Any ailments can lead to a weakness of the spleen and stomach, depleting fluids internally, which can result in malnourishment. For instance, when a tidal fever occurs at noon, it indicates a weak spleen and a strong heart (noon is the time when the heart is most active), which causes internal heat. The proper approach is to first nourish the liver (the liver is the mother of the heart). When the liver is strong, it can drain the heart, allowing the heart to regain its motherly energy, which then helps alleviate the tidal fever. Physicians, upon seeing tidal fever, mistakenly believe it to be an excess and hastily use cold purgatives such as rhubarb and calomel. If purging is excessive and cannot be controlled, fluids will be depleted, gradually leading to malnourishment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, when symptoms of bowel obstruction arise alongside chills and fever, with hard and painful swelling below the ribs, the treatment should involve gradual dissolution of the condition. Some doctors, upon identifying an obstruction, resort to harsh laxatives like croton seed or realgar. Excessive purging again leads to fluid depletion, resulting in malnourishment. </p>
<p>Additionally, if a patient experiences lingering symptoms of a febrile disease after five or six days, and purgative medication is overly administered, it can cause a weakened spleen and stomach and fluid depletion. This may lead to uncontrollable thirst and heat generation, causing internal heat to deplete the fluids, resulting in external muscle loss and emaciation. Other pathogens may also interact, causing varied symptoms, ultimately leading to malnourishment. Furthermore, prolonged vomiting and diarrhea can lead to the depletion of fluids, which can also result in malnourishment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>In children, excessive consumption of rich and sweet foods can lead to accumulation and result in dysentery and fever, causing depletion of bodily fluids, which can also produce sweetness; thus, sweetness is identified with malnutrition (gan). The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; states that excess of rich and sweet foods accumulates and leads to gan yellow, affirming that various illnesses can indeed lead to malnutrition. </p>
<p>Signs of malnutrition include: dry eyes with fatigue, presence of a white membrane, pale lips and mouth, yellow-black complexion, cravings for dirt or raw rice, preference for sleeping on cold ground, skin diseases such as scabies, discharge of greenish-white or yellow foam, diarrhea with pus and blood, abdominal distension with wheezing and coughing, sores in the ears and nose, sparse hair resembling tassels, a large head with a thin neck, a distended belly with prominent blue veins, drooping arms and legs, emaciation with excessive thirst, weak tendons and heavy bones, and a frail, subdued appearance, all of which are symptoms of malnutrition.</p>
<p>This condition arises from a deficiency of the spleen and depletion of bodily fluids, and if prolonged, it can transform into more severe forms—chronic malnutrition emerges from a slow progression, while acute malnutrition results from a rapid deterioration. Furthermore, one must distinguish between cold and heat, and between fat and thin types: </p>
<p>Fat-and-heat malnutrition is due to the consumption of rich and sweet foods that cause accumulation and the generation of heat, thus it manifests more severely in the early stages; treatment involves the use of Huanglian pills. Thin-and-cold malnutrition arises from prolonged diarrhea and its cooling effects; treatment for this is achieved using Muxiang pills. To treat both cold and heat malnutrition, Sheng pills are recommended. </p>
<p>When treating children&#39;s ailments, it is essential to assess the balance of deficiency and excess, as well as cold and heat, and one must avoid arbitrary actions that lead to loss, to prevent the emergence of malnutrition. If, at the onset of illness, there is a deficiency of the spleen with decreased bodily fluids and a desire for drinking due to thirst, it is necessary to generate bodily fluids in the stomach by administering Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu powder.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p>
<h3>Various Worms</h3>
<p>The classics state that there are nine worms within the organs and intestines of a person. Among them, three worms are particularly capable of causing illness. If the organs and intestines are strong, they cannot inflict harm; if they are weak, one is susceptible to the movements of the worms and thus illness arises. Therefore, the classics have specifically named these three worms: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is called the roundworm, also known as the long worm, which resides between the stomach and diaphragm. When it moves, it causes a child to vomit greenish-white foam or clear water, accompanied by sharp pains in the heart and abdomen. If the worm penetrates the heart, it could be fatal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is the pinworm, which lives in the lower intestines. When abundant, it becomes active, causing hemorrhoids, fistulas, sores, scabs, and leprosy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third is the threadworm, which inhabits the intestines and stomach. Its movement damages the person&#39;s vital energy, resulting in pain and weakness in the waist and legs. There is also a worm resembling fine thread or a horse&#39;s tail, commonly referred to as the horse-tail worm. This worm is not one of the nine but is said to arise from mistakenly swallowing dietary oil. It resides in the stomach and, when it moves, causes severe twisting and stabbing pains in a child&#39;s abdomen, which are unbearable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Children with worm activity often suffer from various illnesses afterward, primarily due to weakened organs and intestines. Those suffering from malnutrition, vomiting, or diarrhea experience even greater severity. Treatment involves using medicine, specifically administered during the early morning hours on the fourth or fifth of the month, which expels the worms before noon. Afterward, a gentle balancing medication should be taken in moderation.</p>
<h3>Weakness and Emaciation</h3>
<p>Children who are weak and emaciated usually suffer after various illnesses, or due to mistakenly using medicine incorrectly, or from vomiting and diarrhea, leading to a deficiency in the spleen and stomach. This results in an inability to properly digest and transform the essence of food, leading to a lack of appetite and significant loss of flesh, thus becoming weak and emaciated.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Classical and Modern Medical Texts, Volume 444</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Grind these into equal parts. Take 1 qian with a cup of water and decoct until reduced to 6 parts, sip as needed. According to the &quot;Zhengzhi Zhunsheng,&quot; add Baizhu (white atractylodes).  </p>

<li>20 betelnuts  </li>
<li>2 liang nutmeg, soaked in shijunzi wine  </li>

</ul>
<p>Grind into powder, form into pills the size of sesame seeds. Take 30-50 pills with rice beverage. After a while, take a dose of Wuwei Yigong San to assist stomach Qi.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Nine Flavor Aloe Vera Pills</strong>: Treats children&#39;s liver and spleen accumulation, emaciation with heat and thirst, irregular bowel movements, or conditions such as lymphatic tuberculosis, and ear sores. Ingredients: Aloe Vera, Hu Huanglian, Huanglian, Mu Xiang, Wu Yi (fried), Qing Pi, Bai Lei Wan, He Shi Cao, each one tael; Musk three qian. Powder together, steam into pills the size of sesame seeds; take one to two qian with plain water on an empty stomach. Wang Kentang says: In my humble opinion, the above formula is for liver and spleen accumulation, food stagnation causing heat, leading to cloudiness in the eyes, neck swellings or tuberculosis, or ear sores, emaciation of the body, fever and thirst, little appetite, abdominal distension, or receding gums, rotten cheeks, sores on the scrotum or penis, or pain in the chest, sides, and lower abdomen, all of which it effectively treats. Use Longdan Cao instead of Qing Pi and omit Musk for even better results.</p>
<p><strong>Huanglian Pills</strong>: Treats malnutrition, thirst from malnutrition, and dry malnutrition. Ingredients: Chuan Huanglian five qian, bile soaked and dried, Gua Lou root, Wu Mei flesh, peeled and roasted Apricot kernels, Shilian, each two qian. Powder together, form pills the size of sesame seeds soaked in beef bile; take one to twenty pills with decoction of Wu Mei, ginger, and honey.</p>
<p><strong>Mu Xiang Pills</strong>: Treats cold malnutrition.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>**Muxiang, Qingdai, Binglang, Roudoukou, and Shexiang each 1.5 qian; Xusui seed 1 liang, removing oil; three toads, roasted until fully cooked. The above should be powdered, formed into pills the size of mung beans, and taken with mint soup, three to five pills per dose. Dr. Tang states: Children with cold diarrhea often experience thirst, prefer to lie on cold surfaces, are irritable and cry a lot, have poor appetite, gradually becoming emaciated; this condition is hard to treat, resembling a heat syndrome, yet they have loose stools, with no remedies proving effective. Hence, one woman tried many medicines without success and was eventually cured with Qian’s Muxiang pills after a few doses. Since then, all cases of this condition have shown consistent results. Xu Ji comments: The previous prescription is for dispelling diarrhea, clearing heat, and promoting water resolution. However, cold diarrhea indicates that the Yang energy is deficient and the spleen and stomach are cold. The Binglang and Xusui seed may harm true Yin and deplete Yang energy; treatment should be approached with caution!</p>
<p><strong>Huanglian Pills</strong> treat heat diarrhea.<br>Huanglian and Hu Huanglian each 5 qian; Zhushā 2 qian, ground separately. The mixture is powdered and filled into a pig&#39;s gallbladder, tied securely with a string, then suspended in a pot and boiled with light rice water until boiling several times. After cooking, mash it finely, adding Aloe and Shexiang each 2 qian, forming into pills the size of millet. Take one or two dozen pills with rice drink. In one formulation, add half a liang of toad without roasting. Xu Ji remarks: In my view, for the previous cases, this formula should be primary, supplemented by the Four Gentleman Decoction with Wiyi. For extreme deficiency of spleen and stomach, prioritize the Four Gentleman Decoction with Wiyi, using the previous pills as a supplement.</p>
<p><strong>Ruxiang Pills</strong> treat cold and hot diarrhea.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Hu Huanglian, Chuan Huanglian, and Bai Wutong, each 2.5 taels; true musk 0.5 taels, ground separately; five dried toads, boiled in wine to make a paste; one tael of Ripe Guozi meat. Mix the right ingredients into a fine powder, then use the toad paste to form pills the size of sesame seeds. Take 10 to 20 pills each dose, washed down with a decoction of ginseng. Xue Ji states: &quot;In my view, the trouble of malnutrition (gan) is due to weak heat in the liver and spleen, causing dryness of fluids. The above formula specifically treats malnutrition by clearing heat. However, if the spleen and stomach are weak, it should be supplemented with Liu Junzi Decoction to tonify the spleen and stomach so that the evil qi can be expelled, allowing for complete recovery.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lanxiang San treats nasal malnutrition and redness. It consists of 2 taels of Lanxiang leaves burned to ash, and 0.5 taels each of copper green and light powder. Mix these into a fine powder and apply dry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bai Fen San treats various malnutrition sores. It includes 0.3 taels of Hai Piao Xiao, 0.2 taels of Bai Ji, and 0.1 taels of light powder. Mix these into a fine powder, wash the affected area with starchy water first, then dry and apply. Xue Ji notes: &quot;The first two formulas are for treating exterior symptoms. If not alleviated, use Si Wei Fei Er Wan to treat internal issues.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Si Wei Fei Er Wan treats vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal distension leading to malnutrition, or persistent diarrhea, food retention, malnutrition of the spleen, cloudy vision, ulcers on the tongue and mouth, decayed tooth roots, fever and thinness, sores all over, clear white urine, enlarged abdomen with blue veins, and all malnutrition syndromes. The ingredients are all equal parts of Huang Lian, Wutong (fried), Shen Qu, and Malt (fried). Mix these into a fine powder, form into walnut-sized pills, and take 10 to 20 pills each time, washed down with a hot white soup on an empty stomach.</strong><a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>Toad Pill treats unwarranted malnutrition: one dose reduces虚热 (false heat), two doses alleviate thirst, and three doses cure dysentery. </p>
<p>Use one toad, collected from still waters in summer, that is large-bellied, does not jump, and remains motionless. Take one scoop of maggot, place it in a bucket, soak it in urine, then kill a spider and feed it to the maggots. After one day and night, place the maggots in a cloth bag and keep it in a strong current overnight. Take them out, dry on a tile, and grind into powder. Mix in a pinch of musk and make into pills the size of sesame seeds. Take twenty to thirty pills with rice wine; the effect is miraculous.</p>
<p>Wuyiyi Powder treats oral worms causing salivation.<br>Ingredients: White Wuyiyi, dry lacquer, all fried, in equal parts. Grind into powder, take five to six fen, and wash down with rice wine.</p>
<p>Anchong Powder treats heart pain caused by worms.<br>Ingredients: Hu powder (yellow) fried, betel nut, wild lime seed, and hernia grass, each three qian, and five and a half fen of dried white alum. Grind into powder and take five to six fen, adjusting with rice wine during pain. Xue Ji said: The cause of worm movement often stems from weak stomach Qi, or is triggered by the smell of food. The first two formulas are for expelling worms, while if due to weakened spleen and stomach, one must supplement middle Qi.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Da Wu Yi Decoction</strong></p>
<p>Treats children&#39;s spleen deficiency with symptoms of poor appetite, fever and thirst, irregular stool, yellowing and shedding of hair, dark complexion, green feces, sores under the nose, and craving for soil. </p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wu Yi</li>
<li>Shan Zhi (both five parts each)</li>
<li>Huang Bo, Gan Cao, Huang Lian, Fang Feng (each two parts)</li>
<li>Ma Huang, Qiang Huo, Chai Hu (each three parts)</li>
<li>Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Dang Gui (each four parts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make two doses, decoct in water. </p>
<p>Wang Kentang states: The formula treats jaundice with soil color, indicating heat and dampness, and if urination is not smooth, it shows yellow indicates agitation, with extreme heat in the stomach channel leading to yellowing and shedding. It suggests both the bladder and kidneys are affected by the damp evil, indicating damp-heat symptoms. Sores under the nose result from soil&#39;s reverse action, with the nutritive qi obstructing fire; craving for soil indicates insufficient stomach qi; dark complexion indicates cold and obstruction. Green feces are related to cold, brown and black indicate heat accumulation in the blood, with yellow indicating heat in the stomach and intestines. The treatment principle should nourish and moisten the essence, eliminate internal cold and heat, and externally induce fluid production.</p>

Peel, pound, and sift to make a powder, then mix with three sheng of good rice vinegar and place in a ceramic bowl. In a large pot, float the bowl in hot water over charcoal, simmering slowly until it becomes a paste suitable for making pills. Store it in a container. For a three-year-old child, take seven pills the size of a walnut, twice daily, monitoring the discharge of green and red pus. If there is no discharge or only a little, gradually increase the number of pills. If there is too much discharge, reduce the dosage. For severe cases, seven or eight doses may be required to fully address the issue. This medicine only eliminates hidden pus and should not cause excessive diarrhea. It is necessary to avoid toxic foods; the nursing mother should also abstain. Additionally, add one and a half taels of mu xiang.</p>
<p><strong>Zhu Du Huang Lian Wan</strong><br>[From &quot;Zhi Zhi Fang&quot;]<br>For children suffering from malnutrition heat causing flowing sores throughout the body, or damp heat leading to bloating and thirst.<br>Take one pig&#39;s stomach, clean it thoroughly, and add five taels of cut Huang Lian mixed with water into the stomach and sew it shut. Place the stomach on five sheng of glutinous rice and steam until thoroughly cooked.<br>Then pound the mixture with a stone mortar until fine, or mix with a little rice to aid in pounding, forming pills the size of mung beans. Each dose is twenty pills, taken with rice drink. Continue with blood-regulating and heart-clearing medicines for support.

<p>This prescription addresses the condition arising from children&#39;s imbalance due to cold and heat. It is the irregularity of cold, heat, and diet that can damage the spleen and stomach.

<p>It is said: Infants suffer various symptoms when ill, mainly due to qi stagnation across the three burners. The sores are linked to the five organs, with internal kidney deficiency leading to sores, termed “acute,” as it resembles a horse galloping, making treatment quite difficult. This condition starts with bad breath, called foul breath; then—teeth blackened, termed “bleeding sand”; severe cases result in rotting gums, known as “decayed channels”; when blood seeps out, it is termed “exposed fluid”; and in extreme cases, teeth may fall out on their own, referred to as “rotten roots.” Once the roots are rotten, how can one manage it? Now, I will carefully describe the secret remedies thereafter.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br><strong>Fang for Tooth Treatment</strong></p>

After changes and steaming, during meals, there is great concern that it may harm nourishment and defense, leading to many ailments. If qi is harmed by toxins and blood is harmed by heat, heat toxins can attack, causing deficiency in the organs. What organ is deficient? The kidneys in young children often symbolize deficiency, so they must not be subjected to attacks by heat toxins. Kidney deficiency damages the muscles and bones; only the teeth receive the residual energy of bones, hence the first signs of disease appear, known as &quot;running horse,&quot; not slowly emerging. The recommended medications are: sweet dew drink, rehmannia paste, detoxifying pills, and detoxifying drink. For external symptoms, use the previously mentioned fang and musk paste to apply. Absolutely avoid hot and toxic foods. This condition differs from usual ailments; it is an innocent affliction. Physicians should deeply explore preservation as the priority.

Tian’s method suggests: For children who are emaciated, moxibustion should be applied with three cones on the bone tip beneath the chest, and subsequently three cones above the tailbone at the lower end of the spine. If a child is emaciated, has prolapsed rectum, feels thirsty, and appears gaunt, where other treatments have failed, place three cones in the indentation three inches above the tailbone. In cases of children who are thin, have ascites, lazy limbs, and shoulders that do not lift, moxibustion should be done on the Zhangmen points with seven cones each. The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; notes: For sores that are foul and smell offensive, moxibustion on the Laogong point with one cone is advised. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: Children who are often malnourished may have a blocked brain due to wind exposure or cold in the lungs; thus, moxibustion on the Shenting point should be done with two cones. At the Xiang points, one inch above, directly on the nose.

<p>Qian&#39;s Commentary on the Use of Medicine states: A physician from Zheng, named Qi, was known for taking in herbal remedies and distributing them to people. His son suddenly developed symptoms of internal heat. Qi himself took two doses of Qingjin ointment and one additional dose, administering it to his son. After taking the medicine, by the third watch, the son had five bouts of diarrhea and was exhausted from sleep. Qi remarked that his son slept too much due to fright, and gave him another dose of Qingjin ointment, which resulted in two more bouts of diarrhea, along with a dry mouth and a feverish body. Qi noted there was still slight heat remaining and administered another dose of Qingjin. His wife questioned: &quot;After using the medicine over ten times, the condition is still unstable; could this create a new illness?&quot; They called upon Qian, who said: &quot;He has already become weak and emaciated.&quot; Initially, they brewed Bai Zhu powder, which was taken several times, and later used Xianggua pills. The son recovered after thirteen days.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: A wealthy family&#39;s son, aged fourteen, had a sallow complexion, was prone to hunger, and felt full only after eating meat. He had been suffering from diarrhea for a month and came seeking treatment. Upon checking his pulse, both hands were large, and though he was not excessively thin or fatigued, I suspected damp-heat and a deficiency of the spleen leading to poor appetite. However, he appeared healthy and had a large appetite, and he wasn’t thirsty, which made me think his condition was caused by intestinal worms resulting in dysentery. I examined his stool and found it indeed was due to roundworms. There happened to be a young doctor nearby who advised using anti-worm medicine and forbade him from taking any accumulating medications, agreeing to check on him on the way back to stop the diarrhea. Unfortunately, he did not make it to the appointment. </p>
<p>In the spring and summer of the following year, the diarrhea recurred, but without abdominal pain and with a dry mouth, likely due to the previous failure to treat the dysentery properly. So, I administered a remedy to eliminate the heat of dysentery, boiling a strong white atractylodes decoction, and within three days the diarrhea stopped. Half a month later, when I passed by his home, I saw the boy was very thin. I recommended using white atractylodes as the chief herb, peony as the deputy, along with ligusticum, dried tangerine peel, 黄连 (golden thread), and hu huang lian (the bitter herb), combining them with a small amount of aloe to form pills to be taken with the white atractylodes decoction. After half a month, the symptoms ceased. I advised that he abstain from meat and sweet foods, and he would recover completely in three years.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>The &quot;Baoying Jinjing Lu&quot; states: A small child had slightly swollen eyelids, a cough with nausea, and cloudy urine. I diagnosed this as a spleen dampness and food accumulation, indicative of severely weakened spleen qi. I prescribed Wuwei Yigong powder as the main treatment, complemented with Simwei Fei&#39;er pill, and he recovered. Later, without dietary restrictions, his vision became unclear. I remarked that this was due to further damage to the spleen and stomach, and he needed nourishment as the primary focus. Disbelieving, he took harsh remedies and later developed wind syndrome, ultimately resulting in his inability to recover.</p>
<p>Another child had emaciated limbs, an increasingly distended abdomen, cold and hot symptoms, with a constant desire for drink. I diagnosed this as a liver-spleen issue, termed Dingxi butter. I used Baizhu powder as the main treatment, supplemented with Xu&#39;s Shiquan pill. After a month, the symptoms gradually improved; I then added Yigong powder with Danggui and Liuwei pill, and after another month, he fully recovered.</p>
<p>For a child with the previous symptoms, all signs of dampness were present, accompanied by heat like fire, and the condition could not be fully described. In the morning, I used Yigong powder, and in the evening, the Simwei Fei&#39;er pill. After over a month, the symptoms slightly improved; I supplemented with Dihuang pill, which allowed him to walk and stand independently. Eventually, he took Dihuang pill in the morning and Yigong powder along with Xiafa pill in the evening for several doses and was completely cured.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>A young child struggled to walk, had few teeth, was thin with prominent bones, had a red face and thirst, and did not respond to the Fat Child Pills. I believed this was due to kidney deficiency and malnutrition, stemming from insufficient paternal essence. The Fat Child Pills are for the spleen and stomach; long-term use would only worsen the kidney deficiency and malnutrition. If you doubt this, the teeth would gradually fall out. I used the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill, adding deer antler and schisandra, and after half a year, the vital energy strengthened and the symptoms improved.</p>
<p>Another child, aged ten, suffered from sores and scabies that did not heal for a long time; the body was emaciated, with intermittent fevers and chills, hot head and cold feet, diarrhea and abdominal pain, bleeding gums and foul breath, extreme thirst, black nails, and a sallow complexion—this was kidney malnutrition. I gave him the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill and applied a detoxifying powder, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a hard lump in the neck, firm like a scab, a sallow complexion, lacked appetite, and did not respond to the antipyretic medicine; this was unjust malnutrition due to toxins. I treated it with toad pill, leading to recovery. If multiple doses do not work and pressing it causes movement, the lump is soft and painless, indicating internal parasites like powder that should be urgently removed with needles. If not urgently addressed, the parasites will travel with energy, eroding internal organs, leading to untreated conditions.</p>

<p>　　　　　五脏内外疳证主治</p>
<p>　　凡小儿疳在内，目肿腹胀，泻利青白，体渐瘦弱；疳在外，鼻下赤烂，频揉鼻耳，或肢体生疮。鼻疮用兰香散，诸疮用白粉散。　　肝疳一名筋疳，白膜遮睛，或泻血而瘦，用地黄丸。　　心疳，面黄颊赤，身体壮热，用安神丸。　　脾疳，一名肥疳，体黄瘦削，皮肤干濇而有疮疥，腹大嗜土，用益黄散。　　肾疳，一名骨疳，肢体瘦削，遍身生疮疥，喜卧湿地，用地黄丸。　　肺疳，一名气疳，喘嗽气促，口鼻生疮，用益黄散。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　若患潮热，当先补肝，后泻心。若妄以硝黄诸药利之；若患癖当消磨，若误以巴豆、硼砂下之；又伤寒误下，皆能成疳。其初病者为热疳，用黄连丸；久病者为冷疳，用木香丸；冷热相兼者，用如圣丸；津液短少者，用白朮散。凡此因大病脾胃亏损，内亡津液所致，当固脾胃为主，而早为施治，则不变败证也。　　 【注　按疳证，或哺食太早，或嗜食甘肥，或服峻厉之药，重亡津液，虚火炽盛；或因禀赋，或乳母厚味七情致之，各当调治其内。<br>】　　若口舌蚀烂，身体壮热，腮唇赤色，或作肿痛，腹膈烦闷，或掌热咽干，作渴饮水，便赤盗汗，啮齿虚惊，此心经内外疳也，用安神丸之类主之。　　若鼻外生疮，眼目赤烂，肢体似癣，两耳前后，项侧缺盆，两腋结核，或小腹内股，玉茎阴囊睪丸肿溃，小便不调，或出白津，或咬指甲，摇头侧目，白膜遮睛，羞明畏日，肚大青筋，口干下血，此肝经内外疳也，用地黄、芦荟二丸主之。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　若头不生发，或生疮痂，或发成穗，或人中口吻赤烂，腹痛吐逆，乳食不化，口干嗜土，泻下酸臭，小便白浊，或合目昏睡，恶闻木音，此脾经内外疳也，用肥儿丸主之。　　若鼻外生疮，咽喉不利，颈肿齿痛，咳嗽寒热，皮肤皱错，欠伸少气，鼻痒出涕，衄血目黄，小便频数，此肺经内外疳也，用地黄清肺饮主之。　　若脑热吐痰，手足逆冷，寒热往来，滑泄肚痛，口臭作渴，齿龈溃烂，爪黑面黧，身耳生疮，或耳出水，或食自发，此肾经内外疳也，用地黄丸主之。凡疳热上攻，或痘毒上升，为患甚速，名为走马疳，急敷雄黄散，服蟾蜍丸。轻则牙龈腐烂，唇吻肿痛，可治；重则牙龈蚀落，腮颊透烂，不治。　　世传方又云：有无辜等疳一十二证。<br>　　　　原机启微 【明　倪维德】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　深疳为害之病</p>
<p>　　卫气少而寒气乘之也，元气微而饮食伤之也，外乘内伤酿而成之也。父母以其纯阳耶，故深冬不为裳；父母以其恶风耶，故盛夏不解衣。父母以其数饥耶，故饲后强食之；父母以其或渴耶，故乳后更饮之。有愚戆而为父母者，又不审其寒暑饮食也，故寒而不为暖，暑而不能凉，饮而不至渴，食而不及饥，而小儿幽元衔默，抱疾而不能自言，故外乘内伤，因循积渐，酿而成疳也。渴而易饥，能食而瘦，腹胀下利，作嘶嘶声，日远不治，遂生目病。其病生翳睫闭不能开，眵泪如糊，久而脓流，竟枯尔目。何则？为阳气下走也，为阴气反上也。治法当如阴阳应象大论曰：清阳出上窍，浊阴出下窍；清阳发腠理，浊阴走五脏；清阳实四肢，浊阴归六腑。各还其原，不反其常，是其治也。当作升阳降阴之剂，茯苓泻湿汤主之，升麻龙胆草饮子主之。此药非专于目，并治已上数证。然勿后，后则危也，为父母者其审诸！<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　儒门事亲 【元　张从政】</p>
<p>　　　　　疳眼</p>
<p>　　凡小儿疳濇眼，数日不开，皆风热所致。可服凉膈散，泻肝经风热郁甚，郁结散而自开也。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　牙疳</p>
<p>　　凡小儿牙疳齿龋者，是齿龈腐烂也。下牙属手阳明大肠之经，燥金为主，上牙属足阳明胃经湿土，上下是肠胃二经也。或积热于内，或因服银粉、巴豆大毒之药，入于肠胃，乳食不能胜其毒，毒气循经而至于齿龈牙缝嫩薄之分，反为害也。可以麝香玉线子治之。乳母临卧，当服黄连解毒汤一服，牙病自愈。<br>　　　　奇效良方 【明　方贤】</p>
<p>　　　　　虫</p>
<p>　　儿童疳(上匿下虫)，昏睡烦躁，鼻烂汁臭，齿断生疮，下利黑血，虫食下部为狐，下唇有疮；虫食其脏为惑，上唇有疮。三虫者，谓长虫、赤虫、蛲虫也，乃有九种，而蛲虫及寸白人多病之。寸白从食牛肉饮白酒所成，相连一尺则杀人，服药下之，须结裹溃然出尽乃佳。若断者相生未已，更宜速除之。蛲虫多是小儿患之，大人亦有。其病令人心痛，清朝口吐汁烦躁则是也。其余各种种不利，人人胃无不有者，宜服九虫丸以除之。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　婴童百问 【明　鲁伯嗣】</p>
<p>　　　　　疳证</p>
<p>　　诸疳皆脾胃之病，内亡津液之所作也。因大病或吐泻后，以药吐下，致脾胃虚弱，内亡津液。且小儿病疳，皆庸医所坏。病如潮热，是脾脏虚一脏实而内发虚热也，法当补母而泻本脏则愈。假令日中发潮热，是心虚热也，肝为心母则宜先补肝，肝实而后泻心，心得母气则内平而潮热愈也。医见潮热，妄谓其实，乃以大黄、牙硝辈诸冷药利之，既利多矣，不能禁约而津液内亡，即成疳也。又有病癖，其疾发作，寒热饮水，胁下有形硬痛。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>治癖之法，当渐消磨，医反以巴豆、硇砂辈下之，小儿易虚易实，下之既过，胃中津液耗损，渐以疳瘦。　　小儿脏腑娇嫩，饱则易伤。乳哺饮食，一或失常，不为疳者鲜矣，则疳以伤得。恣食甘肥粘腻，生冷咸酸，以滞中脘，则疳因积成。或乳母寒暄失理，饮食乖常，喜怒房劳，即与儿乳，则疳因母患传气而入，此非病家不能调适之过乎？疳之为候，头皮光急，毛发焦稀，腮缩鼻干，口馋唇白，两眼昏烂，揉鼻挦眉，脊耸体黄，鬬牙咬甲，焦渴自汗，尿白泻酸，肚胀肠鸣，癖结潮热，酷嗜瓜果、咸酸、炭、米、泥土而欲水饮者，皆其候也。　　夫疳曰五，疳病关乎五脏以别之。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　心疳即惊疳。外证身体壮热，脸赤唇红，口舌生疮，胸膈烦闷，小便赤濇，五心烦热，盗汗发渴，咬牙虚惊是也。　　肝疳即风疳。外证摇头揉目，白膜遮睛，眼青多泪，头焦发立，筋青脑热，躁渴汗多，下利疮癣是也。　　肾疳即急疳。外证脑热肌削，手足如冰，寒热时来，滑泄肚痛，口鼻干渴，齿龈生疮，爪黑面黧，身多疮疥是也。　　肺疳即气疳，亦名疳(上匿下虫)。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>外证咳嗽喘逆，壮热恶寒，皮肤粟生，鼻痒流涕，咽喉不利，颐烂唾红，气胀毛焦，泄利频并是也。　　脾疳即食疳，亦名奶疳。外证身面俱黄，肚大脚细，吐逆中满，水谷不化，泄下酸臭，合面困睡，减食吃泥是也。　　诸疳宜大芦荟丸、肥儿丸、胡黄连丸、地黄丸、生熟地黄汤，皆要药也。集圣丸、嚏疳散、脂连丸、五疳良方至圣丸、通神丸、天麻丸、地黄清肺饮、化(上匿下虫)丸、灵脂丸、下虫丸、龙胆丸、黄连丸、香蔻丸、木香丸、褐丸子、黄芪汤鳖血煎、蚵蚾丸、厚朴丸等剂，对证详明施治。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　　疳伤</p>

<p>　　仲阳云：虚羸者，脾胃不和，不能乳食，致使肌肤瘦弱；亦因大病或吐泻后，脾胃尚弱，不能传化谷气也。有冷者时时下利，唇口青白；有热者身热温壮，肌肉微黄，此冷热虚羸也。冷者木香丸主之，夏月不可服，如有此证则少服之。热者胡黄连主之，冬月不可服，如有此证则少服之。伤寒后虚羸者，竹叶汤主之。常服四君子汤、异功散、参苓白朮散之剂，皆可服也。橘连丸久服充肥。兼服肥儿丸。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　医学正传 【明　虞抟】</p>
<p>　　　　　诸疳证</p>
<p>　　《内经》曰：数食肥，令人内热；数食甘，令人中满。盖其病因肥甘所致，故命名曰疳。若夫襁褓中之乳子，与四五岁之孩提，乳哺未息，寡气未全，而谷气尚未充也。父母不能调助，惟务姑息舐犊之爱，遂令恣食肥甘，与夫瓜果生冷，及一切烹饪调和之味，朝餐暮食，渐成积滞胶固，以致身热体瘦，面色萎黄，或肚大青筋，虫痛泻利，而诸疳之证作矣。钱仲阳曰：小儿病疳，多因大病后或吐泻后，以药下之，致脾胃虚损，亡津液而成。盖此证实由愚医之所害耳。斯言也，特一端耳，未可悉以为然。其所谓大病吐泻，岂非饮食之所致与？夫仲阳为儿医之袓，岂有误耶？其所论诸疳形证治法，班班可考，学者不可不审。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>如疳在肝，则膜遮睛，法当补肝，地黄丸主之；疳在心，则面颊赤，身体壮热，法当补心，安神丸主之；疳在脾，则体黄腹大，好食泥土，法当补脾，益黄散主之；疳在肺，则气喘，口鼻生疮，亦当补脾，益黄散主之，此虚者补其母也；疳在肾则极瘦而身生疮疥，法当补肾，地黄丸主之。骨疳喜卧冷地，当服补肾地黄丸。内疳则目肿腹胀，利色无常，或沫青白，渐而瘦弱，此冷证也，宜服木香丸。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>外疳鼻下赤烂，自揉，鼻头有疮，不结痂，绕目而生，当用治疮烂兰香散、白粉散等药。法曰：诸疳皆因本脏，而补其母，则子自安。假令日中潮热，是心经虚热也，肝为心之母，宜先补肝，肝实而后泻心，心得母气，则内平而潮热愈矣。余皆仿此。大抵疳病，当辨冷热肥瘦而治：其初病者为肥热疳，久病者为瘦冷疳。冷则用木香丸，热则当用胡黄连丸，冷热疳并，宜用至圣丸之类。惟小儿之脏腑柔弱，不可痛击，大下必亡津液而成疳证，为儿医者当以幼幼之心为心而善调之，毋纵巨胆，妄为施治，以绝人之嗣续，幸甚！<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>　　　　医学准绳六要 【明　张三锡】<br>　　　　　疳眼</p>
<p>　　小儿肥甘恣意，寒暑不适，生冷油腻伤脾，糖面热物助火，因循积渐，酿成疳疾。渴而易饥，善食而瘦，发竖下泄，腹胀鼻干，作嘶嘶声。久久不治，脾弱肝强，肝火自燎其窍，遂成目眚，多生翳膜，睫闭不能开，眵泪如糊，久而脓流，乃中州弱而清阳不升，肝火盛而浊阴不降所致。当升清降浊，以白朮、人参先补脾胃为君，柴胡、枳壳辅上药理脾为臣，苍朮、茯苓、泽泻渗湿降浊为佐，羌活、蔓荆、升麻、川芎、薄荷诸风药胜湿为使，乃正治妙法。　　小儿过用甜物，口臭牙痛眼肿，气口脉洪数，属胃火，泻黄散妙。　　小儿肝经湿热内甚，上攻于目，眼眵腹胀，九味芦荟丸妙。兼脾虚萎黄瘦弱不食者，间服肥儿丸。禀来阴弱有相火证者，心虚，少与六味地黄丸。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　　　古今医鉴 【明　龚信】</p>
<p>　　　　　诸疳</p>
<p>　　夫诸疳者，谓肥甘饮食之所致也。治宜理脾胃，消积化虫，清热止泻住痢，以肥儿丸、疳积饼为主。此二方不问诸疳冷热，服之最效。大抵疳之为病，皆因过餐饮食，于脾家一脏有积不治，传之余脏而成五疳之疾。何谓五疳？心肝脾肺肾也。如疳在心，则面赤口干，咬牙舒舌，口舌生疮，身热体瘦，以安神丸主之；疳在肝，则面青翳膜遮睛，摇头揉目多泪，头焦发竖，筋青脑热瘦弱，以补肝汤主之；疳在脾，则面黄身热，腹胀肚大，好食泥土，水谷不消，泄下酸臭，困睡减食肌瘦，以益黄散主之；疳在肺，则面白咳嗽喘逆，口鼻生疮，咽喉不利，肚热恶寒，鼻流清涕，以清肺汤主之；疳在肾，则面黑肌肉瘦而体生疮，身热尿濇，手足冰冷，口鼻干渴，以地黄丸主之。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>　　　　保婴撮要 【明　薛铠】</p>
<p>　　　　　疳</p>
<p>　　小儿诸疳，皆因病后脾胃亏损。或用药过伤，不能传化乳食，内亡津液，虚火妄动；或乳母六淫七情，饮食起居失宜，致儿为患。五脏之疳不同，当各分辨。其证虽多，要不出于五脏治法。肝疳，用地黄丸以生肾。心疳，用安神丸以治心，异功散以补脾。脾疳，用四味肥儿丸以治疳，五味异功散以生土。肺疳，用清肺饮以治肺，益气汤以生金。脑疳亦用地黄丸。无辜疳用大芜荑汤、蟾蜍丸。丁奚、哺露用服儿丸，大芦荟丸。走马疳敷雄黄散，服蟾蜍丸。若作渴泻痢肿胀劳瘵等类，当详参方论而治之。盖疳者干也，因脾胃津液干涸而患。在小儿为五疳，在大人为五劳，总以调补胃气为主。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>　　　　　疳伤</p>
<p>　　大抵多因乳哺失节，脾气有伤，元气下陷，或乳母饮食七情所致。小便如泔，或大便泔白者，用四味肥儿丸；积滞黄黑者，用四君子汤加黄连、木香；色青日久不复，或兼泄泻，或腹痛者，用六君子汤加木香、芍药；若小便不利，大便褐色，发黄脱落，鼻下疮痍，用栀子茯苓汤；乳食少思，胸腹膨胀，大便频数，用四味肥儿丸。仍审乳母饮食七情主之。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>　　　　　虫</p>

<p>　　即疳热而骨蒸，兼诸咳嗽盗汗等证是也。汤氏鳖甲散、猪肚丸皆对证之药。<br>　　　　　疳积</p>
<p>　　其候面带青黄色，身瘦肚膨胀，发竖身热，肚中微痛。此因疳盛而传为此候。治之，先用匀气散、醒脾散调理二日。后下青金丹取下疳积，再下匀气醒脾散补之，常服保童丸即愈。　　《玉诀》云：疳气腹胀潮热，先与调胃气，后与取虚积药，次服疳药。<br>　　　　　疳泻</p>
<p>　　先用青金丹取下疳积，后用匀气散、香连散、乳香散调理；泻止，常服保童丸。　　《石壁经》云：疳泻因不慎饮食，或食交乳致然。腹中有片子或如鸡子，又加三二指大，所以作泻粪如糟，毛发硬，面无光，或青黄色，目多仄视。当分水谷，仍须温和药，和气即愈。若药热，则作肿而死。　　泻而多食为虫疳，宜杀虫药；泻而少食为冷疳，宜温药。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>　　　　　虚羸</p>
<p>　　母气不足，则羸瘦肉极。<br>　　小儿羸瘦，不生肌肤，皆为脾胃不和，不能饮食，故血气衰弱，不能荣于肌肤也。挟热者，即温壮身热，肌肉微黄，其挟冷者，即时时下痢，唇口青白。　　小儿经诸大病，或惊癎，或伤寒，或温壮，而服药或吐利发汗，病瘥之后，气血尚虚，脾胃犹弱，不能传化谷气，以荣身体，故虚羸也。　　更当审其形色，察其见证。如面赤多啼，心之虚羸也；面青目札，肝之虚羸也；耳前后或耳下结核，肝经虚火也；颈间肉裹结核，食积虚热也；面黄痞满，脾之虚羸也；面白气喘，肺之虚羸也；目睛多白，肾之虚羸也。仍审相胜而药之。又寒热二证，不可不辨。若腹痛，泻利清白，不渴喜热，此属寒证，虽在夏月，宜木香丸。身热烦躁，泻利焦黄，作渴喜冷，此属热证，虽在冬月，宜胡黄连丸。皆舍时从证之治法也。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>　　　　　丁奚</p>

<p>　　小儿疳病，诸论丛杂，唯五疳之说为当。其证候外则传变不同，内则悉属五脏。一曰肝疳，其候摇头揉目，白膜遮睛，遍身多汗，喜覆面而卧，眼中濇痒，色泽青黄，发竖头焦，筋青脑热，腹中积聚，下痢频多，日渐羸瘦。二曰心疳，其候浑身壮热，颊赤面黄，心胸膈脘烦躁满闷，口舌生疮，盗汗多惊，下痢脓血，神彩衰耗。三曰脾疳，其候腹大如鼓，上多筋脉，喘促气粗，心腹壅胀，多啼咳逆，水谷不消，唇口干燥，好食泥土，情意不乐，憎明好暗，痢多酸臭，肌肉内消，形枯力劣，甚则大肉陷下。四曰肺疳，其候咳嗽气逆，皮毛焦落，咽喉不利，揉鼻咬甲，口鼻生疮，腹内气胀，乳食不进，大肠不调，泄痢不常，憎寒体栗，粪中米出，洞下白泔。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>五曰肾疳，其候上热下冷，寒热时作，齿龂生疮，耳焦脑热，手足逆冷，吐逆滑泄，下部生(上匿下虫)，脱肛不收，夜啼饶哭，渐成困重，甚则高骨乃败。小儿疳疾，乃与大人劳瘵相似，故亦名疳劳。大人劳者，因肾脏虚损，精髓衰枯；小儿疳者，因脾脏虚损，津液消亡。病久相传，至五脏皆损也。大人劳疾，骨削而气耗；小儿疳疾，腹鼓而神羸。以其病之始也，其脏之传受不同故也。至于传久，五脏皆损则一也。故五损者，经言一损于皮毛，皮聚毛落，肺也；二损于血脉，血脉虚少不能荣于脏腑，心也；三损于肌肉，肌肉消瘦，饮食不为肌肉，脾也；四损于筋，筋缓不能自收持，肝也；五损于骨，骨痿不能起于床，肾也。病极则大肉陷下，高骨败坏，以至死矣。凡小儿有疾，多是上下所坏。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>小儿脏腑嫩软，易虚易实，于一切诸病悞行转下，致脾胃虚弱，津液内耗，皆能成疳。且如潮热日中时发者，是脾脏虚心脏实【日中乃心用事之时，】 而内发其热，法当先补其肝母 【肝乃心之母也，】 肝实而后泻心，心得母气则平而潮热乃愈。医见潮热，妄谓其实，便以大黄、牙硝等冷药利之，利既多而不能禁，则津液内亡，渐成疳也。又如癖病发作，寒热饮水，胁下有形而硬痛，法当用药渐消磨之。医见有癖，便以巴豆、硇砂辈快药下之，下既多而津液耗，则渐成疳也。又如伤寒五六日之后，有下证，因以冷药下之太过，致脾胃虚而津液耗，即便引饮不止而热生，如此则热气内耗于津液，肌肉外消而羸瘦，他邪相干，证变百端，亦因成疳也。又如吐泻病久，津液耗亡，亦能成疳。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>又如小儿食肥甘物多，因伤为积，则蕴痢发热，津液内耗，亦能作甘，故甘即疳也。《圣济经》云：肥甘之过，积为疳黄，乃谓是矣，故诸病皆能成疳也。凡疳之候，眼濇多困，或生白膜，唇口淡白，身色黄黑，食泥土生米，喜卧冷地，疥癣头疮，洞泄青白黄沫，下痢脓血，腹满喘咳，耳鼻生疮，发稀作穗，头大项细，肚大青筋，脚手垂亸，瘦瘠饮水，筋痿骨重，形劣尩羸，皆其证也。本因脾虚津耗，久则传变而成，传缓者则为慢疳，传紧者则为急疳。又当辨认冷热肥瘦：其肥热疳者，乃因食肥甘，积聚生热而作，故多病于初也，治用黄连丸。其瘦冷疳者，乃因转下泻痢生冷而作，故多病于久也，用木香丸。通治冷热疳者，用如圣丸。凡治小儿之病，必量虚实冷热，不可妄行转下，恐变生疳也。若病初之脾虚津少，发渴欲饮者，当生胃中津液，煎钱氏白朮散与服。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>　　　　　诸虫</p>
<p>　　经言人脏腑中有九虫，内三虫偏能发动为病，人脏腑实强，则不能为害，若脏腑虚弱，则随虫所动而生焉。故经亦别立三虫之名：一曰蛔虫，又曰长虫，居胃脘之间，动则令儿吐青白沫，或吐清水，心腹刺痛，若虫贯心者即死。二曰蛲虫，居洞肠之间，多则发动，为痔瘘(上匿下虫)蚀疮疥痂癞。三曰寸白虫，居肠胃之间，动则损人精气，令腰脚痛弱。更有一虫形若细丝，或如马尾，故俗呼马尾虫。此虫不在九虫之数，或云饮食中误咽油发所变，亦居胃中，动则令儿腹中搅刺发痛，不可忍受。小儿虫动者，多病于诸病之后，盖因脏腑虚弱故也。患疳劳吐泻者，尤甚。治法用药，惟每于月初四五日间，在五更时服之，至日午前，虫即尽下矣。后以平调药一两服和之，不可多也。<br>　　　　　虚羸</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If suffering from tidal fever, one should first nourish the liver and then purge the heart. If one rashly uses drugs like natron and yellow sulfur, it can be harmful. If afflicted with lumps, one should dissolve them; if mistakenly treated with seeds or borax, it can lead to deterioration. Mismanagement of cold damage can also lead to sores. In the case of initial illness manifesting as a hot sore, use Huang Lian Pills; for chronic illness manifesting as a cold sore, use Mu Xiang Pills; for a combination of hot and cold symptoms, use Ru Sheng Pills; if fluids are deficient, use Bai Zhu Powder. All these conditions result from severe illness damaging the spleen and stomach, leading to the loss of bodily fluids. Therefore, strengthening the spleen and stomach should be the priority, and treatment should be applied early to prevent deterioration.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Disease Caused by Deep Deficiency</p>
<p>The harm from deep deficiency arises when the protective qi is weak, allowing coldness to invade; when the vital qi is diminished, leading to injuries from food and drink; and when external factors invade and cause internal damage, resulting in this condition. Parents, due to their pure yang nature, do not wear heavy clothing in deep winter; due to their aversion to cold winds, they do not shed their garments even in the height of summer. Some parents, with their frequent hunger, force-feed after nursing; others, when thirsty, give more liquid after nursing. There are foolish parents who do not discern the effects of cold, heat, food, and drink, hence they do not provide warmth when it is cold, cannot cool down when it is hot, do not quench thirst with drinks, and do not feed adequately when hungry. The child remains silent, holding on to the disease without being able to express it, thus allowing external factors to invade and internal damage to accumulate gradually, leading to the development of deficiency.</p>
<p>Symptoms may include thirst with easy hunger, the ability to eat yet losing weight, abdominal distension with diarrhea, and a whistling sound from the throat. If left untreated for a long time, it may result in eye diseases. This condition manifests as cataracts or closed eyelids that cannot open, with tears resembling paste, and over time leads to pus discharge, finally resulting in the eye becoming desiccated. Why does this happen? It is due to the downward movement of yang qi and the upward reversal of yin qi. The treatment should follow the principles of yin and yang as discussed in the Great Treatise: clear yang exits from the upper orifices, while turbid yin exits from the lower orifices; clear yang activates the pores, while turbid yin affects the five organs; clear yang fills the limbs, while turbid yin returns to the six bowels. Each should be returned to its origin, not reversed from its normal state; this is how it should be treated. One should prepare formulas to raise yang and lower yin, such as Poria Decoction to Drain Dampness or the formula with Cimicifuga and Gentian. These medicines are not solely for the eyes but also address the aforementioned symptoms. However, one should not delay treatment, as it may become dangerous; parents must be vigilant!<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p>For children with teething issues and tooth decay, this is due to the decay of the gums. The lower teeth are associated with the Hand Yangming Large Intestine meridian, governed by dry metal, while the upper teeth relate to the Foot Yangming Stomach meridian, governed by moist earth. Both are linked to the intestines and stomach. This may be caused by accumulated heat within, or due to the ingestion of toxic substances such as silver powder or dainty beans, which harm the intestines and stomach, rendering dairy and food unable to counter the poison. The toxic vapors then travel along the meridians to the delicate gums and gaps between the teeth, creating harm. It can be treated with musk and jade thread. The wet nurse, before sleeping, should take a dose of Huanglian Detoxifying Decoction, and the dental issues will resolve naturally.</p>

<p>In children, the symptoms of gu (nutritional impairment caused by parasitic infestations) (hiding worms below) include drowsiness and irritability, a runny nose with foul-smelling discharge, sores on the teeth, and black blood in diarrhea. Worms affect the lower body, causing sores on the lower lip; when they affect the organs, sores appear on the upper lip. The &quot;three worms&quot; refer to roundworms, hookworms, and pinworms, of which there are nine types, with pinworms commonly affecting people. Pinworms result from consuming beef and drinking white liquor; if they interconnect, they can be fatal. When medication is taken to expel them, it is best for them to exit in a wrapped, complete form. If the infestation is interconnected, they should be removed promptly. Pinworms predominantly affect children, but adults can also be affected. This condition causes heart pain; if someone is irritable and has a bitter taste in their mouth during the Qing Dynasty, this is also related. Other types of diverse infestations can be detrimental, as everyone has worms in their stomachs; it is advisable to take the Nine Worm Pill to eliminate them.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Infant&#39;s Hundred Questions</strong> (Ming Dynasty, by Lu Bosi)</p>
<p><strong>Thirsting Sickness</strong></p>
<p>All instances of thirsting sickness are illnesses of the spleen and stomach, arising from the loss of bodily fluids. These conditions are often caused by severe illnesses or by vomiting and diarrhea, leading to the weakness of the spleen and stomach and the depletion of internal fluids. Furthermore, children&#39;s thirsting sickness is often worsened by incompetent doctors. When the sickness manifests as tidal fever, it indicates the spleen&#39;s deficiency and the presence of inner heat; thus, the treatment should focus on nourishing the mother organ while purging the affected organ for recovery. </p>
<p>For instance, if the tidal fever occurs at noon, it indicates heart deficiency and heat; since the liver is the mother of the heart, one should first nourish the liver, then purge the heart once the liver is strong, restoring balance and thus alleviating the tidal fever. Doctors who observe tidal fever mistakenly diagnose it as an issue of excess and recklessly use cooling laxatives like rhubarb and other such medicines. This aggressive purging only exacerbates the condition by further depleting bodily fluids, ultimately leading to thirsting sickness. There are also other related ailments where symptoms include intermittent attacks along with sensations of cold or heat, and firm painful sensations beneath the ribs.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method to treat phthisis should gradually wear away; however, if one uses drastic purgatives like croton seeds or realgar, it can harm children because they easily fluctuate between deficiency and excess. If purged too much, it will deplete the gastric fluids, leading to gradual emaciation due to phthisis. </p>
<p>Children’s organs are delicate, and overeating can easily cause harm. If there is any irregularity in breastfeeding and dietary habits, it is rare not to cause phthisis, which leads to injury. Indulging in sweet, rich, sticky, cold, salty, or sour foods can obstruct the stomach and cause phthisis from accumulation. If the wet nurse maintains an inappropriate regimen or has emotional outbursts while nursing, the condition can be transmitted to the child, stemming from the mother’s ailments—this is beyond the capability of the patient’s family to rectify.</p>
<p>The symptoms of phthisis include a shiny and tense scalp, sparse and burnt hair, a shrunken face with dry nose, a craving for food with pale lips, dark and dull eyes, scratching the nose and eyebrows, a hunched back with a yellowish body, grinding teeth, thirst with sweating, whitish urine, acid diarrhea, abdominal bloating, intestinal rumbling, and a hot, sticky constitution.

<p>The condition of cerebral gnawing occurs when the fetus is poorly affected by wind and heat, and after being born, continues to be breastfed in an irregular manner.

<p>The condition of dry gnawing presents with emaciation and a lack of blood, a dry tongue, and the illness affects the heart.

Overall, these represent five types of gnawing.</p>
<p>The condition of gnawing thirst arises when there is internal wind with gnawing energy, compounded by the wet Nurse’s indulgence in strong tasting foods and alcohol, leading to stagnation and heat in the child’s heart and lungs.

Additionally, if a child&#39;s clothing is exposed under the eaves, becoming soiled by feathers from poisoned birds, worms may enter the skin and cause unexplained illness. After washing the clothes, they should be dried lightly over a fire.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Various Types of Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Eating too much rich food causes internal heat; eating too much sweet food leads to fullness in the abdomen. The cause of illness here is due to rich and sweet foods, hence it is termed malnutrition. As for infants in swaddling clothes and children aged four to five years, who are still nursing and have not yet gained full vitality, their digestive energy is not complete. If parents fail to balance their diet and instead indulge in the affection of overfeeding—allowing them to consume excess rich and sweet foods, as well as cold fruits and all manner of cooked and flavorful dishes, for breakfast and dinner—this gradually results in an accumulation of stagnation and firmness, leading to bodily heat and thinness, a pale yellow complexion, a distended abdomen with blue veins, intestinal pain, and diarrhea, thus manifesting the symptoms of malnutrition. </p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang stated: Children suffer from malnutrition often due to the aftermath of a major illness or after vomiting and diarrhea, caused by the medicinal treatment that damages the spleen and stomach, resulting in the loss of bodily fluids. This condition is truly the result of harm done by ignorant physicians. However, this view is only one facet and cannot be considered entirely accurate. Is it not the case that the major illness involving vomiting and diarrhea is often due to food? Since Zhongyang is regarded as the ancestor of pediatric medicine, could he be mistaken? His discussions on the symptoms and treatment of malnutrition are well-documented, and students should study them carefully.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The external sore beneath the nose is red and rotten, and if rubbed, sores appear on the tip of the nose without scabbing, spreading around the eyes. One should treat these sores with herbs such as Lanxiang San and Baifen San. The method states: all sores arise from the internal organs, and by nourishing the mother organ, the child organ will naturally stabilize. For instance, when there is midday heat, it indicates deficiency heat in the heart. The liver is the mother of the heart; therefore, one should first nourish the liver, and only after the liver is strong can one drain the heart. If the heart receives the maternal qi, balance will be restored internally, and the midday heat will subside. All cases should follow this principle. Generally speaking, in treating sores, one must discern between hot and cold, as well as fat and thin: those who are newly affected tend to have fat heat sores, while those suffering for a long time tend to have thin cold sores. For cold, one should use Muxiang Wan, while for heat, one should use Huhuanglian Wan. When both hot and cold sores occur together, use something like Zhi Sheng Wan. However, one must consider the fragility of a child&#39;s internal organs; excessive purging will deplete fluids and lead to sore symptoms. Therefore, pediatricians should treat with a tender heart and adjust carefully, avoiding reckless actions that could interrupt future generations.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Medical Guidelines: Six Essentials (By Ming Dynasty Zhang Sanxi)</h3>
<p><strong>Kang Yan (Pediatric Eye Disease)</strong></p>
<p>Children indulge in rich and sweet foods, are sensitive to cold and heat, and consume raw, oily, and fatty foods that harm the spleen. Sugary and hot items exacerbate fire within, leading to gradual accumulation and the onset of Kang disease. Symptoms include thirst and easy hunger, a good appetite but emaciation, hair standing upright with diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and dry nasal passages, accompanied by a wheezing sound. If left untreated for a long time, the spleen weakens while the liver strengthens, resulting in the liver fire scorching its channels, leading to vision issues and the formation of opacities. The eyelids may stick together and cannot open, and tears become thick. Over time, pus may flow due to the deficiency of the Middle and the failure of clear yang to ascend, while the overabundance of liver fire prevents the turbid yin from descending.</p>
<p>The treatment involves promoting clear and descending turbid: Begin with white atractylodes and ginseng to strengthen the spleen and stomach as the main ingredients. Then, use Bupleurum and bitter orange to assist the main remedy in regulating the spleen. Follow with the supporting herbs: together with poria, water plantain to drain dampness, and the wind-dispelling herbs such as Notopterygium, vitex, levisticum, chuanxiong, and mint to expel dampness effectively—this constitutes the rightful treatment.</p>
<p>Additionally, if children consume too much sweet food, they may suffer from bad breath, toothache, and swollen eyes, with a rapid pulse indicating stomach fire, treated by dispersing yellow powder. If the liver channel is excessively damp and hot, attacking the eyes with symptoms of eye discharge and abdominal bloating, the Jiu Wei Aloe Pill is a fine remedy. For those presenting with spleen deficiency, emaciation, and lack of appetite, intermittent use of Fatty Child Pill is suggested. For those inherently weak in yin with signs of internal fire, accompanied by symptoms of heart deficiency, use little of the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>Consumption refers to ailments caused by excessive rich and sweet foods. Treatment should focus on regulating the spleen and stomach, dissipating accumulated heat and transforming parasites, as well as clearing heat, stopping diarrhea, and controlling dysentery, with primary reliance on Fat Child Pills and Consumption Cakes. These two remedies are effective regardless of whether the consumption is hot or cold. Generally, the disease of consumption arises from overeating, leading to accumulation in the spleen, which then transfers to other organs, resulting in the five types of consumption. What are the five types? They are related to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys.</p>
<p>If consumption affects the heart, there will be a red face, dry mouth, grinding of teeth, and sores in the mouth and tongue, with body heat and emaciation; treat it with Anshen Pills. If it affects the liver, there will be a bluish face, obstruction in vision, frequent tearing, prickling headache and stiff hair, with blue veins and heat in the brain leading to debility; treat it with Liver Tonifying Decoction. If it affects the spleen, there will be a yellow face and body heat, abdominal bloating, a desire to eat dirt, undigested food with sour-smelling diarrhea, lethargy, reduced appetite, and emaciation; treat it with Yihuang Powder. If it affects the lungs, there will be a pale face, cough, breathlessness, sores in the mouth and nose, throat discomfort, abdominal heat with aversion to cold, and clear nasal discharge; treat it with Lung Clearing Decoction. If it affects the kidneys, there will be a dark face, emaciated body with sores, body heat and frequent urination, cold hands and feet, and dry mouth and nose; treat it with Dihuang Pills.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pediatric Essentials</strong></p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>In children, all forms of malnutrition arise from the deficiency of the spleen and stomach following illness. This can occur from the excessive use of medicine, which harms their ability to digest milk and food, leading to a loss of bodily fluids and the emergence of false heat; or it may be caused by a wet nurse’s improper dietary habits and emotional stresses, which negatively affect the child. The manifestations of malnutrition differ according to the five organs, and must be identified accordingly. Despite the many symptoms, they all fundamentally relate to treatment of the five organs. For liver-related malnutrition, use Earth Huang Pills to nourish the kidneys. For heart-related malnutrition, use Calming Heart Pills for the heart and Yigong Powder to strengthen the spleen. For spleen-related malnutrition, use the Four Ingredient Fat Baby Pills and the Five Flavor Yigong Powder to enrich the earth element. For lung-related malnutrition, use Clear Lung Decoction for the lungs and Energizing Decoction to enhance the metal element. For brain-related malnutrition, also use Earth Huang Pills. For unjustly caused malnutrition, use Large Wood Plant Decoction and Toad Pills. For instances of sudden losses of energy and poor breastfeeding conditions, give Infant Pills or Large Aloe Vera Pills. For galloping malnutrition, apply Male Yellow Powder and administer Toad Pills. If symptoms like thirst, diarrhea, dysentery, swelling, or exhaustion occur, one should refer to specific prescriptions for treatment. In essence, malnutrition signifies dryness, resulting from the depletion of bodily fluids in the spleen and stomach. In children, this manifests as five types of malnutrition, while in adults it appears as five types of exhaustion, with the primary approach always focusing on balancing and nourishing the stomach energy.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Worms</strong></p>
<p>The roundworm is one of the nine types of worms, measuring about five to six inches long. It arises from weakness of the organs and from eating rich, fatty foods. Its movements cause abdominal pain, alternating in intensity, often accompanied by drooling. If it penetrates the heart, it can be fatal; it is advised to use pills such as the &quot;Junzi Wan&quot; to expel them. Qian Zhongyang states that if there is drooling without heart pain, it indicates a cold stomach; if there is both drooling and heart pain, it is a worm-related pain, resembling epilepsy, but the eyes do not squint and the hands do not twitch. For this condition, it is prescribed to use &quot;Anchong San.&quot; Tian Shi notes that with worm pain, one may cry, fidget, or be unable to sit or lay still, often pressing on the chest and abdomen, frequently crying out, with a complexion of green and yellow, lips partly white, eyes lacking luster, and drooling. If due to a cold stomach causing vomiting, one should take &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; with five roasted Sichuan peppers and half a liang of betel nut, and decoct with &quot;Wu Mei Wan.&quot; It is said that when worms erode the upper part, there will be white spots on the upper lip; when they erode the lower part, there will be white spots on the lower lip. The various worms in the abdomen have their heads directed upwards when viewed from the front, and downwards when viewed from the back. To administer medicine, first use pig liver roasted in oil to release its aroma, allowing the child to smell it, which will make the worm&#39;s head turn upwards, facilitating the ingestion of medicine. If the Qi is weak and the worms are restless, one should simply tonify the spleen and stomach for tranquility. Master Danxi states that in winter, when expelling worms, it often indicates a deficiency of cold Qi in the stomach; the remedy is to use Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu San with two cloves of clove added.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p>Consumption arises from an illness that damages the body, such as a cold that lasts five or six days and is sometimes accompanied by diarrhea. If treated excessively with cooling medicines, it can lead to spleen and stomach deficiency resulting in a decrease in bodily fluids, which in turn causes persistent thirst and generates internal heat. This internal heat consumes vitality, the muscles waste away, and other illnesses may interfere, leading to various symptoms that form the condition of consumption. Additionally, prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, or excessive improper treatment by physicians, can exacerbate the deficiency, causing agitation of bodily fluids and also leading to consumption.  </p>
<p>In children, consumption often results from the inability to properly digest milk and food, causing accumulation in the belly. Variations in temperature can lead to persistent thirst, alongside symptoms resembling cough and wheezing, similar to tidal heat. If not treated early, it will inevitably lead to labor consumption. Due to the presence of accumulated conditions, children may refuse food, resulting in spleen and stomach deficiency and the production of heat, hence the yearning for drink. Excessive drinking will wash away the spleen and stomach&#39;s essence, leading to a loss of bodily fluids which cannot transform food and water. The pulse becomes deep and thin, indicating an inability to eat and drink, leading to further deficiency in the spleen and stomach, weakness in the limbs, and the emergence of various illnesses, ultimately resulting in consumption.  </p>
<p>For children under twenty years of age, the illness is termed consumption; for those over twenty, it is termed tuberculosis. Both consumption and tuberculosis stem from deficiency of qi and blood, resulting from injury to the intestines and stomach, differing only in name. Why is this? Children have delicate organs; overconsumption easily harms them. Any disruption in diet from milk or food can seldom avoid leading to consumption. Consumption results from the imbalance in milk and food intake, excessive richness and lack of moderation.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some infants may be deprived of milk, or they may be given porridge and rice too early, which exhausts their natural vitality and leads to the development of malnutrition; others, a few months later, may consume excessive milk and food, leading to overindulgence and malnutrition; some might indulge in sweet, fatty, sticky, or cold and salty foods, which can obstruct their digestive systems, causing malnutrition as a result; and if the wet nurse neglects proper care and the diet becomes irregular, influenced by their own emotions or exhaustion, and then they feed the child, malnutrition may be transmitted from mother to child due to the mother&#39;s condition. Is this not a case where the family cannot adjust to the illness? Malnutrition occurs when the spleen and stomach are affected, leading to a lack of bodily fluids. Some may develop it after vomiting or diarrhea from improper treatments that exhaust their bodily fluids; others may acquire it due to excessive heat and frequent diarrhea without restrictions, leading to dryness in the stomach; or because of a cold illness that has gone too far, causing thirst for water and then turning into heat, where heat has not dissipated and then is further affected by other pathogens; there are also cases of chronic cold and heat, with pain and hardness on the sides that cannot be gradually resolved, only to be harshly treated, resulting in bodily fluids being violently damaged. Is this not a case of doctors using harsh methods to treat the illness carelessly? </p>
<p>Liver malnutrition, also known as &quot;wind liver&quot; or &quot;muscle malnutrition,&quot; manifests as white membranes covering the eyes, with muscle malnutrition presenting as diarrhea with blood and weight loss, the whites of the eyes appearing blue, accompanied by itchiness, head shaking and eye rubbing, sweating profusely, a hunched posture when sleeping, pale yellow complexion, sparse hair, blue veins and heat in the brain, and sores and eczema all over the body, with accumulations in the abdomen and frequent diarrheas. Over time, if not healed, the condition worsens, leading to severe weight loss, mucky discharge from the eyes, a left side of the forehead appearing blue, or slightly yellow in the whites of the eyes, with diarrhea mixed with water, or resembling the color of moss. </p>
<p>Heart malnutrition is also called &quot;fright malnutrition.&quot;<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is a child who has long suffered from kidney deficiency, with internal weakness and poor appetite, to the point that the cervical vertebrae are misaligned. The treatment should use Qian&#39;s Rehmannia Pill with additional remedies to expel parasites, as well as apply treatments to strengthen the muscles at the neck. If one does not recognize the symptoms and labels it as &quot;five weakness,&quot; this is incorrect. Misalignment of the cervical vertebrae can occur in three conditions: 1) prolonged vomiting and diarrhea leading to weakness; 2) liver and gallbladder heat causing a red face and tongue that suddenly changes; 3) a febrile illness that fails to vent. All of these involve wind evil entering the liver, resulting in the relaxation of muscles and tendons. For those with vomiting and diarrhea, one should regulate the stomach’s qi. For liver heat, one should cool the liver according to severity, while also applying treatments to strengthen the muscles at the neck. However, misalignment due to febrile illness is difficult to treat.</p>

<p>To counter heat, coolness is applied; to counter cold, warmth is applied; to balance both heat and cold, a combination of warming and cooling is utilized; this is the essence of it. Heat-related sickness often manifests externally, with symptoms such as red sores below the nose, wet itching sores on the head, restlessness of the five hearts, rough breathing when lifting the clothes, thirst for cold water, irritability while lying on the ground, a hot belly but cold feet, and intermittent tidal fever; all these are signs of heat-related illness. Cold-related sickness typically manifests internally, with unpredictable bowel movements, greenish-white diarrhea, weak limbs, swollen eyes, and a dark complexion. Additionally, there may be dryness and thirst while lying down, resembling heat, yet with an inability to intake food and constant diarrhea; this also indicates cold-related illness. If there is excessive diarrhea with pus and blood, leading to increasing weakness, it is termed a cold-heat illness. Generally, the cause of such illnesses is deficiency. Heat arises from internal deficiency of heat, while cold arises from internal deficiency of cold. When treating heat, one must not excessively cool; when treating cold, one must not sharply warm or swiftly replenish. Thus, Qian also states: children are easily affected by deficiency or excess. The spleen&#39;s deficiency cannot tolerate cold or heat; taking cold substances results in further cold, while taking warm substances leads to added heat; it is essential to recognize this to avoid errors. Is this not a fundamental principle for the young? The superior physician addresses this by dissolving accumulation, harmonizing the stomach, nourishing the blood, and regulating the qi, adhering to suitable medicines to support the patient, with light and simple diet for nourishment, ensuring harmony between the nourishing and protecting forces, allowing the organs to be naturally full. Any excess in this regard, and the gentleman cannot guarantee its success. The methods of treating accumulation must also be carefully weighed.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Accumulation is the root of consumption; it is called consumption when it becomes extreme due to accumulation. Those who have accumulation will always have a hot abdomen and cold feet, so one must carefully assess the condition of fullness and emptiness to treat them accordingly. If the accumulation leads to severe emptiness, then one should first support the stomach to ensure its energy is full, and then apply mildly purgative treatments. If accumulation is stronger than emptiness, then one should first use laxatives to promote a discharge, and urgently administer tonic medications to support the emptiness.</p>
<p>While it is appropriate to use laxatives to treat accumulation, one should not neglect remedies like cardamom, radish seeds, dried ginger, and herbs that dissolve accumulations. Pain in the sides or abdomen is also considered a form of accumulation within emptiness; it usually starts cold and later turns hot. Patients may experience coughing or wheezing due to drinking water, and there is a theory regarding accumulation causing tidal heat. Treatment should address both the cold and hot conditions and also include laxatives. </p>
<p>Considering these signs and symptoms, it is clear that the onset of the condition varies, and the methods of treatment are not uniform—thus one must exercise discretion in handling these cases! Generally, the illness of consumption arises from overeating and drinking, leading to accumulations within the spleen; if left untreated, these can affect the remaining organs and cause the five types of consumption diseases. If the spleen&#39;s issue is resolved, the other organs will also stabilize, but neglecting treatment for an extended period will inevitably lead to changes in the condition.</p>
<p>For spleen-related illnesses, one may use aloe pills, sandalwood-betel nut pills, or crystal elixirs and black rhinoceros pills, paying close attention to the balance of fullness and emptiness in treatment. For those with parasites, one may use the gentleman&#39;s pill or anti-parasitic decoction. For abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting clear fluids, indicating that the parasites are expelling downwards, one may frequently administer the two saint pills.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All types of malnutrition should appropriately use the formula &quot;Wugan Baotong Wan&quot; or &quot;Cheng Wanying Wan&quot; for regular consumption to resolve accumulation and treat malnutrition. Additionally, one should apply formulas to balance the corresponding organs: for calming the mind, use &quot;Fushen Decoction&quot;; for regulating the liver, use &quot;Qiguai Decoction&quot;; for regulating the spleen, use &quot;Shenling Baizhu Powder&quot;; for supplementing the lungs, use &quot;Bulei Powder&quot;; for nourishing the kidneys, use &quot;Tiaoyuan Powder.&quot; If each treatment is suitable, the previous symptoms should not recur.</p>
<p>Accumulation is the mother of malnutrition; thus, if accumulation is not treated, it leads to malnutrition. Furthermore, if accumulation is not eliminated and remains while the organs are deficient, it severely worsens malnutrition. Generally, the malnutrition that children suffer from involves diarrhea at all times without the occurrence of wind symptoms. Only malnutrition-related diarrhea is named hot diarrhea, as the movement of the organs is limited, hence wind symptoms do not develop. Although there is no wind-induced diarrhea, it can transform into other symptoms: excessive thirst due to deficiency heat, agitation accompanied by diarrhea, abdominal swelling and shortness of breath are all indications of deficiency in malnutrition.</p>
<p>As the ancients said: when malnutrition is of deficient type, it should be supplemented, recognizing that malnutrition is a disease, and one should not further stimulate the organs. At the onset, it is called &quot;malnutrition qi.&quot; When the abdomen is distended and tense, it is termed &quot;malnutrition deficiency.&quot; Frequent diarrhea and dysentery are called &quot;malnutrition accumulation.&quot; A feeling of five hearts being weak and troubled is called &quot;malnutrition heat.&quot; Hair thinning and loss of vitality, a distended abdomen with visible veins, and a craving for unusual substances are called &quot;malnutrition extreme&quot; [indicating that the disease has reached a serious point]. Heat manifesting in fluctuations and the body being emaciated, with a lackluster complexion and pallor is termed &quot;malnutrition fatigue.&quot;<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The hands and feet are small, the neck is long and bony, the buttocks lack flesh, the abdomen is swollen and the navel protrudes, known as Dingxi. After eating, there is vomiting; the skull seems divided; there is thirst leading to drinking; worms come out of the mouth, called Bulu. All these are symptoms of malnutrition (gan). Additionally, due to excessive consumption of raw, cold, sweet, sticky, greasy foods, stagnation accumulates in the middle, failing to digest, leading to malnutrition over time. </p>
<p>To treat malnutrition, one must assess the severity of symptoms, regulate the organs, harmonize the middle, and ensure the three burners function well, allowing the stomach&#39;s energy to be warm and to accept food. Strengthening the spleen enhances digestion, causing the organs to naturally adjust, enabling the blood and qi to interact, and fortifying both muscle strength and bone strength, leading to clarity of spirit and vitality. This aids in the elimination of malnutrition and expulsion of worms, gradually leading to recovery.</p>
<p>However, if one attacks the internal organs with medicine, displacing the intestines and stomach, forcing out accumulated toxins and worms, this may be called medical treatment, yet it is not a genuine approach. An infant&#39;s organs are weak, making them prone to worms; weakness leads to stagnation, malnutrition, and fullness—what good is purging then? If one continues this cycle, the intestines and stomach become weak, resulting in malnutrition, turning the symptoms to weakness, making it impossible to save an innocent child.</p>
<p>If the symptoms are numerous and cannot be classified as a specific type of malnutrition, one should consult the various general treatment methods for malnutrition. If specific symptoms correspond to those of the five types of malnutrition, one should refer to the original treatment methods to differentiate between cold, heat, deficiency, and excess, using them accordingly. It is essential to understand this well to avoid errors.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

<p>Liver illness is caused by improper diet, leading to heat in the liver. If the wet nurse fails to regulate temperature, indulges in flavors, or if the infant suffers from external wind and cold, combined with internal emotions of joy and anger, lingering evil qi can lead to the infant developing wind illness. The liver corresponds to the eyes; heat may accumulate in the upper diaphragm, causing phlegm and dampness, resulting in wind entering the eyes, causing redness, swelling, and obstructions, along with pus and tears that irritate the eyes, leading to pain, itchiness, and rubbing, which can result in dimness or even blindness, known as “eye illness.” External symptoms include shaking the head and rubbing the eyes, a white membrane covering the eyes, blue discoloration, excessive tears, a hot head with hair standing up, blue veins, a hot brain, itching on the nails, spasms in the tendons, dryness, thirst, excessive sweating, and diarrhea with sores. Qian recommends the Di Huang Pill for treatment, Yang advocates the Tian Ma Pill and cooked/raw Di Huang Decoction, and Zeng employs the Qi Gui Decoction for liver regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Illness</strong></p>
<p>This is also caused by improper diet, resulting in heat in the heart. The blood and qi are unstable; improper nursing leads to stasis and internal heat, which has not been resolved, thus causing the heart to be disturbed and resulting in symptoms of anxiety and shock. External symptoms include a strong fever throughout the body, a red face and lips, oral ulcers, chest discomfort, red and scanty urine, heat in the palms and soles, night sweats with thirst, and a fragile, startled expression. Qian recommends the An Shen Pill for treatment. Xue uses the An Shen Pill for heart issues and Yi Gong Powder to supplement the spleen; Yang suggests the Fu Ling Pill and Qian&#39;s An Shen Pill; Zeng employs the Fu Shen Decoction for calming the heart.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p>This occurs due to irregularities in milk and food intake, causing damage to the spleen and stomach. This may be caused by a wet nurse consuming excessively cold or rich food, or by overfeeding the infant, or by vomiting after milk consumption. Prolonged sleep after excessive milk intake may lead to milk lumps, and abdominal distension with lumps in the sides is also considered a milk abscess. External symptoms include a yellowish face, fever, a distended belly, weakness in the legs, vomiting and fullness, lethargy and crying, inability to digest food, and sour-smelling diarrhea. This condition is treated with Qian&#39;s Yi Huang San.

<p><strong>Lung Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This arises from unregulated milk and food, causing obstruction and heat damaging the lungs. The lungs govern qi, and the nose is connected to the lungs. If the qi is unbalanced, wind and dampness can invade the skin and enter the blood vessels. Consequently, the area around the nose may develop red, itchy, damp sores, known as nasal abscesses. These sores are painless; where fluid flows can lead to ulceration, also referred to as an abscess (obscured upper and lower worms). External symptoms include coughing, wheezing, strong fever with chills, skin eruptions, nasal sores with discharge, sore throat, bloody saliva, abdominal distension with fine hair, and frequent diarrhea. Qian&#39;s treatment focuses on tonifying the spleen to generate the lungs, using Yi Huang San; Yang&#39;s method employs Qing Fei Yin Hua (obscured upper and lower worms) Wan, with Qian&#39;s E Jiao San also applied; Xue utilizes Qing Fei Yin for lung treatment, and Yi Qi Tang for generating gold; Zeng&#39;s approach uses Bu Fei San.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Shen Gan (Kidney Heat)</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from improper diet and the accumulation of heat in the internal organs. Sweet flavors enter the spleen and stimulate parasitic worms. When these worms are active, they invade the internal organs, leading to disturbances and discomfort in children&#39;s hearts. If the condition affects the mouth and gums, oral sores may bleed, and the teeth may turn purple-black; if it erodes the intestines and kidneys, there may be dysentery and anal ulcers, with湿 (dampness) causing itching and sores. If treatment is not initiated early, the essence and marrow can be depleted, making recovery difficult. These parasites (the upper ones hide and the lower ones burrow) are associated with dampness; they are often a result of prolonged diarrhea and damage from chronic illness to the intestines and stomach, resembling symptoms from dietary excess or cold damage leading to tooth decay, sometimes referred to metaphorically as &#39;running horse.&#39;</p>
<p>Teeth relate to the kidneys, which govern weakness. If they are exposed to pathogenic heat, the heat energy drives upwards to the upper jiao (the area of the thorax), hence the metaphor of &#39;running horse.&#39; Initially, foul breath is termed &quot;stinking breath;&quot; subsequently, teeth darken, known as &quot;crumbling sand;&quot; when severe, the gums rot, referred to as &quot;decaying troughs;&quot; if hot blood spurts out, it is termed &quot;expressed leakage;&quot; in extreme cases, all teeth may fall out, denoted as &quot;rotten roots.&quot; Once the roots have decayed, even if one survives, the teeth do not regrow. </p>

<p>The child&#39;s face is pale, the hair is straight, and they often have a fever. Their appetite does not nourish their skin and flesh, and over time, this leads to death, which is called &quot;innocent illness.&quot; It is said that in the heavens there is a bird named Innocent, which hides by day and roams by night, washing the clothes and bedding of children, exposing them overnight. This bird flies down from above, takes the clothes, and covers the child with them, causing the child to develop this illness.</p>
<p>For children with &quot;innocent illness,&quot; there is a hard lump at the back of the head like a bullet. Pressing it causes it to rotate downwards. Whenever a child has this lump, like a pest under the tongue of livestock, if not removed promptly, it often leads to death. This lump initially forms soft and painless, containing a bug like rice flour; it grows larger with warmth. When it becomes large, it hardens, and the bug spreads with the blood and qi, causing blockages. The mother bug and offspring harm the organs, leading to sores on the skin and possibly purulent blood in the stool.</p>
<p>As a result, the child gradually becomes yellow and emaciated, with a large head and frail limbs, leading to premature death. Thus, children suffering from this disease have swollen bellies with purulent blood diarrhea, their hair and skin become dry and withered, and their bodies continue to weaken. Their intestines and stomach are already weak, experiencing diarrhea at all times, hence the name &quot;innocent illness and diarrhea.&quot;<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

This is not the case; rather, it is due to the harm caused by the eight evils. The eight evils are hunger, satiety, labor, fatigue, wind, fright, heat, and accumulation. They are known as the eight evils. Over time, this leads to gradual yellowing and emaciation, lack of nourishment despite eating, crying at night, a slight fever, excessive thirst, inability to sense hunger or satiety, and possibly developing sores or skin diseases.</p>
<p>In a song of eight verses by the Zhu family: The child&#39;s unwarranted energy often results from the mother&#39;s actions. If one can take care and be cautious, how could they witness such emaciation? Fright causes wind-related ailments, and warmth and cold create energy depletion. It is necessary to avoid sickly milk and not to overdress. Meals should not be rushed; speech should not be feared for its lateness. Discussing the eight prohibitions, the chest feels weak and heavy. The scalp is shiny and bare, with sparse hair. Liver stagnation affects the eyes, while spleen deficiency leads to yellowing in limbs. The entire body develops itchy rashes, and there are sores all over. Diarrhea and dysentery are relentless, with fluctuations in temperature.

Now I will categorize and list &quot;running horse canker,&quot; &quot;oral canker,&quot; &quot;nasal canker,&quot; &quot;ocular canker,&quot; etc., as follows. </p>
<p>Running horse canker is the most severe form of canker, marked by the internal organs steaming with heat and attacking upwards, leading to a collapse akin to sand falling. The flesh at the edges of the teeth rots, the mouth emits a foul odor, there is a slight fever in the body, inability to eat, fresh blood oozing from the gaps between teeth, and the teeth feel shaky as if they are about to fall out, with the flesh rotting and falling away. </p>
<p>To treat it, first rinse the mouth with a mild saltwater solution, then administer Zijing powder mixed in, three times a day, to eliminate the worms at the edges of the teeth. If the condition is severe, apply Qiuchuang powder mixed in, then adjust with vermilion ointment and ox gall ointment combined with Tianzhu yellow powder, following the method of Master Mao. Alternatively, using Tianzhu yellow powder mixed with dihuang ointment is also effective, according to the method of Huiyan. </p>
<p>With such adjustments, the patient will be stable. If the condition does not improve and one to three teeth begin to fall out, the patient may not recover. Over time, the face will look gaunt, the cheeks will become hollow, and the patient may cease to live.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The treatment of initial symptoms with a retreat of wind-heat from the spleen and lungs should involve taking Betel Nut Powder in five to seven doses, followed by applying this medicine to the gums. Take a large jujube, remove the pit, and place a small amount of arsenic inside, then burn it to ash for application. Before sleeping, apply it to the gums several times for effectiveness.</p>
<p>Those experiencing this condition often suffer from qi deficiency due to cold, along with stagnation of retained food that does not pass, leading to accumulated warmth becoming heat. The deficiency heat rises and can be aggravated by consuming sweet, sour, salty, or greasy foods. Although the spleen enjoys sweetness, prolonged stagnation can trap heat that ascends to the mouth, causing teeth to become blackened and rotten, sometimes discharging clear blood. When blood accumulates, it may turn into pus that becomes foul and leads to dental erosion, even resulting in the cheeks being perforated. This follows with difficulties in eating dairy or other foods, a bright yet floating complexion, shortness of breath and heat, collectively termed &quot;Running Horse Sore.&quot;</p>
<p>The method for treating this involves first eliminating the accumulated heat with a combination of Angelica Powder and Three-sided Powder, decocted with water, ginger, and jujubes for consumption. Next, administer Aloe Vera Pills, Jade Dew Decoction, and rinse with warm salt water. Alternatively, wash with a soft chicken feather dipped in salt water, then lightly dry, followed by applying Burnt Salt Powder, Inner Gold Powder, and Mithradate Powder.</p>
<p>If the condition does not improve over time, apply the treatment above and below the lips. If it progresses to a collapsing sand syndrome or leads to perforation of the cheeks, dislocated teeth, and exposed bone, along with reduced intake and wheezing, it will certainly lead to a dangerous state.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

This is a mild and slow form of the condition known as &quot;running horse rot.&quot; The &quot;Sacred Wisdom&quot; describes it as excessive. Treatment should focus on clearing the stomach with formulas like Qingwei San and Ganlu Yin taken internally, while externally, one can use fried black myrobalan, green vitriol burnt red, and a small amount of human-centered white, applied with a bit of borneol to wipe the teeth, or adding betel nut powder to kill parasites is also acceptable.</p>
<p>For nasal rot, the symptoms include poor adjustment of dairy and food in children, causing stagnation in the upper body and allowing rot worms to erode the nose. Symptoms include redness and itching in the nose, strong fever with excessive crying, dry and brittle skin, emaciation, cough with difficulty breathing, irregular diarrhea, and sores at the nostrils and lips, hence it is called nasal rot.</p>
<p>The illness of damp rot often results from prolonged diarrhea and weak spleen and stomach, where worms in the intestines erode the five organs, causing distress and irritation. If the erosion occurs above, there will be ulcers in the mouth, nose, and gums; if below, the anus will be injured and rotten, making treatment difficult. This can also arise from long-term dysentery, internal heat causing excessive sleepiness, or a preference for sweet foods, which enables the worms to thrive and leads to this condition.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Children have a strong desire for sweet flavors, which often leads to the movement of various worms in the stomach and intestines, resulting in the erosion of the internal organs; this is akin to &quot;upper concealment and lower worms.&quot; Generally, all five flavors enter the stomach, and their essence returns according to the tastes of the organs. The spleen and stomach are interrelated and are both associated with earth. Sweetness, being soft and moist, nourishes the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are nourished, the worms become active; when they are active, they cause erosion resulting in &quot;gan&quot; (a disease). Since the worms are stimulated by sweetness, it is named &quot;gan.&quot; If the worms erode the lower part, sores will develop at the anus, and in severe cases, the child may die within days, necessitating urgent treatment.</p>
<p>If young children have irregular feeding habits, with improper combinations of hot and cold, they can harm their internal organs and lead to the &quot;gan qi&quot; (the essence of gan). When the spleen and stomach are weak, breastfeeding becomes ineffective, leading to a weak and cold large intestine, resulting in diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea can cause both the intestines and stomach to weaken, allowing dampness to invade, worms to move internally, and cause erosion of the lower parts; this is called &quot;gan li shi&quot; (gan with dampness).</p>
<p>Gan sores appear on the face and nose of children; they are neither itchy nor painful and often produce a discharge. Where the discharge flows, sores quickly form. These sores can also appear on other parts of the body, which is common in children and results from the clash of wind and dampness with the blood and qi; hence, they are not itchy or painful, which is why they are named &quot;gan sores.&quot;<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Copper Wall Mountain Man said: In treating malnutrition, it is not necessary to categorize into five types; rather, if there is deficiency, then tonify; if there is heat, then clear; if there is cold, then warm. If there is vomiting, treat the vomiting; if there is diarrhea, treat the diarrhea; if there is accumulation, treat the accumulation; if there are worms, treat the worms. One should simply use the recipe for the Gathered Sage Pills, adjusting as needed; it has been repeatedly tested and proven effective.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Heat</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wang from the East Han discusses the condition of children who experience fevers, show emaciation, have increased thirst, consume food without gaining muscle. This condition is termed malnutrition heat. For malnutrition heat, one should take the Digestive Pills, and intermittently take the Pest Suppressing Pills; afterward, take the Turtle Shell Powder to resolve the fever, followed by the Fat Infant Pills.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>This refers to malnutrition characterized by symptoms such as scorching heat and bone fever, along with cough and night sweats. The medicinal formulas Tang&#39;s Turtle Shell Powder and Pig Stomach Pills are used to address these symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms include a face with a bluish-yellow tint, emaciation, abdominal swelling, erect hair, and body heat, along with slight abdominal pain. This condition arises from severe malnutrition leading to such symptoms. For treatment, first use the Harmonizing Qi Powder and the Awakening the Spleen Powder for two days to regulate. Then administer the Qingjindan to eliminate malnutrition accumulation, followed by the Harmonizing Qi and Awakening the Spleen Powders for nourishment. Regular use of the Baotong Pill will lead to recovery. The &quot;Jade Secrets&quot; states that with malnutrition and abdominal distension with tidal heat, first provide stomach harmonizing treatments, then administer medicines to eliminate excess, followed by malnutrition medications.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>First, use Qingjindan to remove malnutrition accumulation, and then employ Harmonizing Qi Powder, Xianglian Powder, and Ruixiang Powder for regulation. Once diarrhea stops, continue with Baotong Pill. The &quot;Shibi Classic&quot; mentions that malnutrition diarrhea is caused by careless eating or consuming spoiled milk. There may be pieces in the abdomen or lumps resembling eggs, which can contribute to loose stools like gruel, coarse hair, a dull complexion, or a bluish-yellow tint, with eyes often looking squinted. It is crucial to divide food and drink, and gentle medications should suffice for recovery. If the medicine is too hot, it will cause swelling and death. Diarrhea with increased appetite indicates parasitic malnutrition, and anti-parasitic medicine is recommended; while diarrhea with reduced appetite suggests cold malnutrition, thus warm medicine is advisable.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Deficiency and Emaciation</h3>
<p>If the maternal energy is insufficient, the body becomes extremely emaciated. When children are emaciated and lack flesh, it is due to the disharmony of the spleen and stomach, preventing them from properly digesting food, resulting in weak blood and energy that cannot nourish the skin. Those with heat will exhibit warmth and slightly yellow muscles, while those with cold will often have diarrhea and pale lips. </p>
<p>Children who have suffered from severe illnesses, such as convulsions, typhoid, or severe warmth, and have taken medicine or undergone purging or sweating, may still have weakened energy and blood after recovery. Their spleen and stomach remain weak, preventing them from transforming and transporting food energy to nourish the body, leading to emaciation.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to carefully observe their physical appearance and symptoms. For instance, a flushed face and excessive crying indicate heart deficiency; a pale face and sunken eyes suggest liver deficiency; swelling before and behind the ears or below them indicates deficient liver fire; a lump of flesh in the neck signals food accumulation and deficient heat; a yellowish face with fullness indicates spleen deficiency; a pale face with shortness of breath denotes lung deficiency; and white eyes indicate kidney deficiency. </p>
<p>One must also consider the interplay of elements in treatment. Additionally, distinguishing between cold and heat is crucial. If there is abdominal pain with clear-white diarrhea, no thirst, and a preference for warmth, this indicates a cold condition, and even in summer, one should use wood fragrance pills. If there is body heat, restlessness, yellow diarrhea, thirst, and a preference for cold, this indicates a heat condition, and even in winter, one should use Hu Huanglian pills. The treatment should prioritize symptoms over the seasons.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dingxi</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as Dingxi in children, particularly in those who are ill, is caused by excessive feeding, which leads to weakness in the spleen and stomach, preventing proper digestion. If food is not digested, the essence of water and grain is diminished, resulting in insufficient nourishment for the qi and blood, leading to emaciated muscles. The symptoms include a swollen abdomen, a thin neck, and a yellowish pallor. If not treated for a long time, it can evolve into conditions like food stagnation and malnutrition, all classified under the name Dingxi, which encompasses three similar conditions with varying severity.</p>
<p>In general, if a child has been vomiting and experiencing diarrhea for an extended period without recovery, or if they are bedridden and have large knees with thin shins, this is also referred to as Dingxi. If the child is under seven years old, it is called &quot;drumstick wind,&quot; and if under fifteen, it is termed &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; These conditions are all attributed to wind-cold injuring the kidneys, as the kidneys govern the bones.</p>
<p>When distinguishing between conditions like malnutrition (gan zhang) and Dingxi, it is noted that if the child&#39;s abdomen is swollen and veins are visibly prominent, it is called gan zhang. If there are no visible veins, it is named Dingxi, arising from overfeeding that injures the stomach. Dingxi is a long-accumulating condition similar to malnutrition, primarily caused by excessive eating that harms the spleen and stomach, resulting in their weakness. Without sufficient digestion, food intake decreases, leading to insufficient generation of qi and blood.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

Afterward, take the cream of clarified butter powder before meals, and after eating, administer three to five black rhinoceros pills to aid the spleen in transforming food. This method is based on the technique of welcoming and seizing. Intermittently include the spleen-awakening powder, areca nut and cardamom pill, and wood fragrance and rhizome pill to gradually restore balance.

<li><p><strong>Liver Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include shaking the head and rubbing the eyes, a white membrane covering the eyes, excessive sweating all over the body, a preference for covering the face while sleeping, itchy and watery eyes, a blue-yellow complexion, hair standing upright and dry, blue veins with heat in the head, abdominal distention, frequent diarrhea, and gradual emaciation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Heart Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include a sensation of overall heat, red cheeks with a yellow face, restlessness and fullness in the chest, mouth sores, excessive night sweats, frequent diarrhea with pus and blood, and a diminished spirit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spleen Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include a distended belly like a drum with visible veins, shortness of breath and rough breathing, a feeling of fullness in the abdomen, frequent crying and coughing, inability to digest food, dry lips and mouth, a craving for dirt, unhappiness in moods, aversion to light and preference for darkness, frequent sour-smelling diarrhea, internal muscle waste, weakened physical condition, and in severe cases, abdominal protrusion.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lung Malnutrition</strong>: Symptoms include a cough with reversed breathing, hair loss, difficulty in the throat, rubbing the nose and biting nails, mouth and nose sores, abdominal bloating, inability to ingest milk or food, bowel irregularities, inconsistent diarrhea, aversion to cold with a chilled body, rice grains in stool, and white discharge from the lower body.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fifth type is kidney deficiency (腎疳), characterized by upper heat and lower cold, intermittent chills and fevers, mouth sores, scorching ears and a heated head, cold extremities, vomiting and diarrhea, worms in the lower part of the body (with anus prolapsing), excessive nighttime crying, and gradually increasing weakness, which if severe, leads to bone degeneration. Children&#39;s deficiency diseases resemble adult consumption, hence it is also called &#39;deficiency consumption.&#39; Adult consumption occurs due to kidney damage and a decline in essence; children&#39;s deficiency arises from spleen damage and depletion of fluids. If the illness persists, all five organs become affected. Adults with consumption have weakened bones and depleted energy; children with deficiency have swollen abdomens and weakened spirits. The differences at the onset of the illness stem from how the organs receive and transmit the problems. However, with prolonged illness, the damage to all five organs becomes uniform. Therefore, the five losses are: the first loss is to the skin (毛), leading to hair loss, associated with the lungs; the second loss is to the blood vessels, with deficiency preventing nourishment of the organs, related to the heart; the third loss is to the muscles, weakening them and inhibiting nourishment from food, linked to the spleen; the fourth loss is to the tendons, which become relaxed and unable to contract, associated with the liver; the fifth loss is to the bones, leading to inability to rise from bed, related to the kidneys. When the illness is at its worst, flesh sinks down and bones decay, ultimately leading to death. In general, when children are ill, it often results from damage to the upper and lower parts of the body.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Children have delicate and soft organs, making them prone to both deficiency and excess. Any ailments can lead to a weakness of the spleen and stomach, depleting fluids internally, which can result in malnourishment. For instance, when a tidal fever occurs at noon, it indicates a weak spleen and a strong heart (noon is the time when the heart is most active), which causes internal heat. The proper approach is to first nourish the liver (the liver is the mother of the heart). When the liver is strong, it can drain the heart, allowing the heart to regain its motherly energy, which then helps alleviate the tidal fever. Physicians, upon seeing tidal fever, mistakenly believe it to be an excess and hastily use cold purgatives such as rhubarb and calomel. If purging is excessive and cannot be controlled, fluids will be depleted, gradually leading to malnourishment. </p>
<p>Moreover, when symptoms of bowel obstruction arise alongside chills and fever, with hard and painful swelling below the ribs, the treatment should involve gradual dissolution of the condition. Some doctors, upon identifying an obstruction, resort to harsh laxatives like croton seed or realgar. Excessive purging again leads to fluid depletion, resulting in malnourishment. </p>
<p>Additionally, if a patient experiences lingering symptoms of a febrile disease after five or six days, and purgative medication is overly administered, it can cause a weakened spleen and stomach and fluid depletion. This may lead to uncontrollable thirst and heat generation, causing internal heat to deplete the fluids, resulting in external muscle loss and emaciation. Other pathogens may also interact, causing varied symptoms, ultimately leading to malnourishment. Furthermore, prolonged vomiting and diarrhea can lead to the depletion of fluids, which can also result in malnourishment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In children, excessive consumption of rich and sweet foods can lead to accumulation and result in dysentery and fever, causing depletion of bodily fluids, which can also produce sweetness; thus, sweetness is identified with malnutrition (gan). The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; states that excess of rich and sweet foods accumulates and leads to gan yellow, affirming that various illnesses can indeed lead to malnutrition. </p>
<p>Signs of malnutrition include: dry eyes with fatigue, presence of a white membrane, pale lips and mouth, yellow-black complexion, cravings for dirt or raw rice, preference for sleeping on cold ground, skin diseases such as scabies, discharge of greenish-white or yellow foam, diarrhea with pus and blood, abdominal distension with wheezing and coughing, sores in the ears and nose, sparse hair resembling tassels, a large head with a thin neck, a distended belly with prominent blue veins, drooping arms and legs, emaciation with excessive thirst, weak tendons and heavy bones, and a frail, subdued appearance, all of which are symptoms of malnutrition.</p>
<p>This condition arises from a deficiency of the spleen and depletion of bodily fluids, and if prolonged, it can transform into more severe forms—chronic malnutrition emerges from a slow progression, while acute malnutrition results from a rapid deterioration. Furthermore, one must distinguish between cold and heat, and between fat and thin types: </p>
<p>Fat-and-heat malnutrition is due to the consumption of rich and sweet foods that cause accumulation and the generation of heat, thus it manifests more severely in the early stages; treatment involves the use of Huanglian pills. Thin-and-cold malnutrition arises from prolonged diarrhea and its cooling effects; treatment for this is achieved using Muxiang pills. To treat both cold and heat malnutrition, Sheng pills are recommended. </p>
<p>When treating children&#39;s ailments, it is essential to assess the balance of deficiency and excess, as well as cold and heat, and one must avoid arbitrary actions that lead to loss, to prevent the emergence of malnutrition. If, at the onset of illness, there is a deficiency of the spleen with decreased bodily fluids and a desire for drinking due to thirst, it is necessary to generate bodily fluids in the stomach by administering Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu powder.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Various Worms</h3>
<p>The classics state that there are nine worms within the organs and intestines of a person. Among them, three worms are particularly capable of causing illness. If the organs and intestines are strong, they cannot inflict harm; if they are weak, one is susceptible to the movements of the worms and thus illness arises. Therefore, the classics have specifically named these three worms: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is called the roundworm, also known as the long worm, which resides between the stomach and diaphragm. When it moves, it causes a child to vomit greenish-white foam or clear water, accompanied by sharp pains in the heart and abdomen. If the worm penetrates the heart, it could be fatal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second is the pinworm, which lives in the lower intestines. When abundant, it becomes active, causing hemorrhoids, fistulas, sores, scabs, and leprosy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third is the threadworm, which inhabits the intestines and stomach. Its movement damages the person&#39;s vital energy, resulting in pain and weakness in the waist and legs. There is also a worm resembling fine thread or a horse&#39;s tail, commonly referred to as the horse-tail worm. This worm is not one of the nine but is said to arise from mistakenly swallowing dietary oil. It resides in the stomach and, when it moves, causes severe twisting and stabbing pains in a child&#39;s abdomen, which are unbearable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Children with worm activity often suffer from various illnesses afterward, primarily due to weakened organs and intestines. Those suffering from malnutrition, vomiting, or diarrhea experience even greater severity. Treatment involves using medicine, specifically administered during the early morning hours on the fourth or fifth of the month, which expels the worms before noon. Afterward, a gentle balancing medication should be taken in moderation.</p>
<h3>Weakness and Emaciation</h3>
<p>Children who are weak and emaciated usually suffer after various illnesses, or due to mistakenly using medicine incorrectly, or from vomiting and diarrhea, leading to a deficiency in the spleen and stomach. This results in an inability to properly digest and transform the essence of food, leading to a lack of appetite and significant loss of flesh, thus becoming weak and emaciated.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

The above should be powdered, formed into pills the size of mung beans, and taken with mint soup, three to five pills per dose. Dr. Tang states: Children with cold diarrhea often experience thirst, prefer to lie on cold surfaces, are irritable and cry a lot, have poor appetite, gradually becoming emaciated; this condition is hard to treat, resembling a heat syndrome, yet they have loose stools, with no remedies proving effective. Hence, one woman tried many medicines without success and was eventually cured with Qian’s Muxiang pills after a few doses. Since then, all cases of this condition have shown consistent results. Xu Ji comments: The previous prescription is for dispelling diarrhea, clearing heat, and promoting water resolution. However, cold diarrhea indicates that the Yang energy is deficient and the spleen and stomach are cold. The Binglang and Xusui seed may harm true Yin and deplete Yang energy; treatment should be approached with caution!</p>

After cooking, mash it finely, adding Aloe and Shexiang each 2 qian, forming into pills the size of millet. Take one or two dozen pills with rice drink. In one formulation, add half a liang of toad without roasting. Xu Ji remarks: In my view, for the previous cases, this formula should be primary, supplemented by the Four Gentleman Decoction with Wiyi. For extreme deficiency of spleen and stomach, prioritize the Four Gentleman Decoction with Wiyi, using the previous pills as a supplement.</p>

The sores are linked to the five organs, with internal kidney deficiency leading to sores, termed “acute,” as it resembles a horse galloping, making treatment quite difficult. This condition starts with bad breath, called foul breath; then—teeth blackened, termed “bleeding sand”; severe cases result in rotting gums, known as “decayed channels”; when blood seeps out, it is termed “exposed fluid”; and in extreme cases, teeth may fall out on their own, referred to as “rotten roots.” Once the roots are rotten, how can one manage it?

In another method, use toad venom mixed with musk and apply. It is said: The flow of blood represents nourishment, while the circulation of qi represents defense. After changes and steaming, during meals, there is great concern that it may harm nourishment and defense, leading to many ailments. If qi is harmed by toxins and blood is harmed by heat, heat toxins can attack, causing deficiency in the organs. What organ is deficient? The kidneys in young children often symbolize deficiency, so they must not be subjected to attacks by heat toxins. Kidney deficiency damages the muscles and bones; only the teeth receive the residual energy of bones, hence the first signs of disease appear, known as &quot;running horse,&quot; not slowly emerging. The recommended medications are: sweet dew drink, rehmannia paste, detoxifying pills, and detoxifying drink. For external symptoms, use the previously mentioned fang and musk paste to apply. Absolutely avoid hot and toxic foods. This condition differs from usual ailments; it is an innocent affliction. Physicians should deeply explore preservation as the priority.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The above text describes various medicinal formulations for treating children&#39;s ailments, particularly related to malnutrition, worms, and other disturbances. </p>
<p>Here’s the English translation:</p>
<p>Right proportions ground evenly, each pill the size of a yellow millet grain; one year takes three pills, three years five pills, up to seven pills; taken with ginseng soup, three times a day, it has unmatched miraculous effects. One formula: four parts Hu Huang Lian, and two parts of the other two ingredients, especially effective for treating damp dysentery and warming miasma. It is called the Holy Pill; there are countless remedies for malnutrition, but none comparable to this. For children&#39;s epilepsy, convulsions, malnutrition, and parasites, taking this shows immediate results. When roundworms cause illness leading to emaciation, or chronic dysentery persists, careful regulation with cooked medicine is difficult to achieve; the only effective methods involve a mix of four herbal drinks and powders, including Ziyuan and Zhisheng powder. The Shuzhi drink, and also this Musk Pill and seven formulas, collectively referred to as the Seven Treasures for Nurturing Infants. The Ziyang Daoist also calls it the Seven Sacred Treasures for Protecting Children, specifically for this book.</p>
<p>Lingyuan Qianjin Pill treats all malnutrition in children. Long-term use strengthens the child and keeps them healthy. </p>
<p>Equal parts of Chuanlianzi and Chuanxiong are ground into powder; mix with pig bile and form into pills the size of sesame seeds. Adjust the number of pills according to the child&#39;s size, each swallowed with rice wine, taken twice a day, with common doses from three to five pills. According to the Zhang family tradition: pills should be the size of broad beans, divided into five parts, using vermilion, indigo, fragrant powder, and light ink, known as the Five-Color Pill, taken only at the right time, washed down with rice drink. According to the Kong family tradition: for treating malnutrition and heat-induced parasites, use fresh pig bile grease made into pills, dissolving in broth; pills should be the size of broad beans, taking ten to fifteen pills, washed down with meat broth. When worms appear like hair, they can be seen immediately; if delayed, they will dissolve.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

Ingredients: Chenpi, sharen, houpo soaked in ginger juice overnight, slowly roasted until dry; malt cleaned and roasted; five qian each of black plum; good ginger chopped, stir-fried with earth from the eastern wall; dried kudzu and wuyao each two and a half qian; grass fruit seeds roasted, two qian; roasted grass three qian. These ingredients should be crushed.

<p><strong>Kuaihuowan</strong>: Treats the condition known as Dingxi with symptoms of emaciated skin, exposed bones, distended abdomen with visible veins, turbid urination, restlessness during sleep, and dull spirit. Regular use strengthens the spleen and resolves accumulation, promotes intake of nutrients. Ingredients: One liang of steamed cake, top removed and hollowed out, half qian of blue vitriol added, then packed tightly with crumbled cake, sealed with wet paper, roasted in ash until dry, then cooled for use. </p>
<p>Crush the above into powder, separately soak fat jujubes in rice washing water overnight, steam briefly, remove skin and pits, then grind in a mortar to a paste, mix with the previously prepared cake powder and grind uniformly again into balls the size of hemp seeds. Dosage: thirty to fifty balls at a time, taken with warm rice soup at any time. For children, it can also be dissolved in rice soup. The number of cakes is not fixed; generally, half a qian of blue vitriol is used for every liang, and a total of half a jin should be prepared using the same method as before. Later practitioners should not mistakenly think that less is better because the recipes do not seem to require a lot of medicinal ingredients, as I have repeatedly tested and verified this. The cakes should resemble southern steamed buns.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: For children with dampness and malnutrition, moxibustion is applied to both sides of the fifteenth vertebra with seven cones; if not healed, add seven more. The &quot;Original Mechanisms Unveiled&quot; comments: For children&#39;s malnutrition affecting the eyes, moxibustion should be done on the Hegu points, with one cone each, using a moxa stick the size of a wheat grain, placed in the indentation between the thumb and the index finger. Tian’s method suggests: For children who are emaciated, moxibustion should be applied with three cones on the bone tip beneath the chest, and subsequently three cones above the tailbone at the lower end of the spine. If a child is emaciated, has prolapsed rectum, feels thirsty, and appears gaunt, where other treatments have failed, place three cones in the indentation three inches above the tailbone. In cases of children who are thin, have ascites, lazy limbs, and shoulders that do not lift, moxibustion should be done on the Zhangmen points with seven cones each. The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; notes: For sores that are foul and smell offensive, moxibustion on the Laogong point with one cone is advised. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: Children who are often malnourished may have a blocked brain due to wind exposure or cold in the lungs; thus, moxibustion on the Shenting point should be done with two cones. At the Xiang points, one inch above, directly on the nose. If a child is emaciated, has little appetite, and does not gain muscle, moxibustion should be applied on the Weishu points with one cone each, located one and a half inches on each side below the twelfth vertebra.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p></div>

<p>Qian&#39;s Commentary on the Use of Medicine states: A physician from Zheng, named Qi, was known for taking in herbal remedies and distributing them to people. His son suddenly developed symptoms of internal heat. Qi himself took two doses of Qingjin ointment and one additional dose, administering it to his son. After taking the medicine, by the third watch, the son had five bouts of diarrhea and was exhausted from sleep. Qi remarked that his son slept too much due to fright, and gave him another dose of Qingjin ointment, which resulted in two more bouts of diarrhea, along with a dry mouth and a feverish body. Qi noted there was still slight heat remaining and administered another dose of Qingjin. His wife questioned: &quot;After using the medicine over ten times, the condition is still unstable; could this create a new illness?&quot; They called upon Qian, who said: &quot;He has already become weak and emaciated.&quot; Initially, they brewed Bai Zhu powder, which was taken several times, and later used Xianggua pills. The son recovered after thirteen days.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: A wealthy family&#39;s son, aged fourteen, had a sallow complexion, was prone to hunger, and felt full only after eating meat. He had been suffering from diarrhea for a month and came seeking treatment. Upon checking his pulse, both hands were large, and though he was not excessively thin or fatigued, I suspected damp-heat and a deficiency of the spleen leading to poor appetite. However, he appeared healthy and had a large appetite, and he wasn’t thirsty, which made me think his condition was caused by intestinal worms resulting in dysentery. I examined his stool and found it indeed was due to roundworms. There happened to be a young doctor nearby who advised using anti-worm medicine and forbade him from taking any accumulating medications, agreeing to check on him on the way back to stop the diarrhea. Unfortunately, he did not make it to the appointment. </p>
<p>In the spring and summer of the following year, the diarrhea recurred, but without abdominal pain and with a dry mouth, likely due to the previous failure to treat the dysentery properly. So, I administered a remedy to eliminate the heat of dysentery, boiling a strong white atractylodes decoction, and within three days the diarrhea stopped. Half a month later, when I passed by his home, I saw the boy was very thin. I recommended using white atractylodes as the chief herb, peony as the deputy, along with ligusticum, dried tangerine peel, 黄连 (golden thread), and hu huang lian (the bitter herb), combining them with a small amount of aloe to form pills to be taken with the white atractylodes decoction. After half a month, the symptoms ceased. I advised that he abstain from meat and sweet foods, and he would recover completely in three years.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Baoying Jinjing Lu&quot; states: A small child had slightly swollen eyelids, a cough with nausea, and cloudy urine. I diagnosed this as a spleen dampness and food accumulation, indicative of severely weakened spleen qi. I prescribed Wuwei Yigong powder as the main treatment, complemented with Simwei Fei&#39;er pill, and he recovered. Later, without dietary restrictions, his vision became unclear. I remarked that this was due to further damage to the spleen and stomach, and he needed nourishment as the primary focus. Disbelieving, he took harsh remedies and later developed wind syndrome, ultimately resulting in his inability to recover.</p>
<p>Another child had emaciated limbs, an increasingly distended abdomen, cold and hot symptoms, with a constant desire for drink. I diagnosed this as a liver-spleen issue, termed Dingxi butter. I used Baizhu powder as the main treatment, supplemented with Xu&#39;s Shiquan pill. After a month, the symptoms gradually improved; I then added Yigong powder with Danggui and Liuwei pill, and after another month, he fully recovered.</p>
<p>For a child with the previous symptoms, all signs of dampness were present, accompanied by heat like fire, and the condition could not be fully described. In the morning, I used Yigong powder, and in the evening, the Simwei Fei&#39;er pill. After over a month, the symptoms slightly improved; I supplemented with Dihuang pill, which allowed him to walk and stand independently. Eventually, he took Dihuang pill in the morning and Yigong powder along with Xiafa pill in the evening for several doses and was completely cured.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child struggled to walk, had few teeth, was thin with prominent bones, had a red face and thirst, and did not respond to the Fat Child Pills. I believed this was due to kidney deficiency and malnutrition, stemming from insufficient paternal essence. The Fat Child Pills are for the spleen and stomach; long-term use would only worsen the kidney deficiency and malnutrition. If you doubt this, the teeth would gradually fall out. I used the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill, adding deer antler and schisandra, and after half a year, the vital energy strengthened and the symptoms improved.</p>
<p>Another child, aged ten, suffered from sores and scabies that did not heal for a long time; the body was emaciated, with intermittent fevers and chills, hot head and cold feet, diarrhea and abdominal pain, bleeding gums and foul breath, extreme thirst, black nails, and a sallow complexion—this was kidney malnutrition. I gave him the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill and applied a detoxifying powder, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a hard lump in the neck, firm like a scab, a sallow complexion, lacked appetite, and did not respond to the antipyretic medicine; this was unjust malnutrition due to toxins. I treated it with toad pill, leading to recovery. If multiple doses do not work and pressing it causes movement, the lump is soft and painless, indicating internal parasites like powder that should be urgently removed with needles. If not urgently addressed, the parasites will travel with energy, eroding internal organs, leading to untreated conditions.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Surgical Methods&quot; states: A child with furrowed brows, frequent crying, vomiting clear foam, abdominal pain, bloating, cyanotic veins, purple-black lips, and itchy anus is said to have roundworm malnutrition. It can be treated with the Large Aloe Pill and will recover.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a></p></div>
