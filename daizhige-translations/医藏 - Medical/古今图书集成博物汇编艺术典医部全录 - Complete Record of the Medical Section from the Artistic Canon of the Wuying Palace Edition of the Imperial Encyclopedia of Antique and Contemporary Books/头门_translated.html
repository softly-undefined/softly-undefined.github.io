<p>Head section: Note: Headache in cold damage occurs in all six meridians, and the symptom of sweating on the head and forehead is also documented in the sweating section; therefore, there is no need for further elaboration here.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>Spring Qi manifests as illness in the head.<br>[<em>Note: The term &quot;Qi&quot; refers to the energies of the four seasons and the five organs, which can lead to illness. The liver&#39;s influence is in the neck, while the spring Qi is in the head, as spring Qi rises and the Yang energy is upward, hence the illness related to Qi manifests in the head.</em>]</p>
<p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of diagnosis, the Five Decisions serve as a record. To understand the beginning, first establish the source. The so-called Five Decisions refer to the five pulses. Therefore, if there is headache and vertex pain, there is deficiency below and excess above; it pertains to the foot Shaoyin and Taiyang, and if severe, it may go into the kidneys. [<em>Note: The beginning refers to the onset of pathogenic influence in the three Yin and three Yang channels. The Five Decisions involve discerning the Yin and Yang energies of the five organs to determine disease. To know the origin of a disease, first separate the five organs as the foundation, examine the pathogenic effects in relation to specific channels, and the corresponding organ channel. Shaoyin and Taiyang are interrelated; Yang Qi originates in the water organ and water viscera and ascends to the vertex. &quot;Excess&quot; indicates the presence of pathogenic influence, while &quot;deficiency&quot; indicates the correct Qi is weak. Hence, headache and vertex pain arise because pathogenic Qi is strong above and the correct Qi is weak below. Pathogenic influences begin in the superficial layers; if they linger, they transition into the channels, hence affecting the Taiyang and Shaoyin channels. If severe, it involves the kidneys; if the channels are affected, then the internal organs are disturbed.</em>] Heart distress and headache indicate illness in the diaphragm, affecting the hand Taiyang and Shaoyin.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The heart is affected by external influences; when the fire energy of the heart encounters evil, it becomes disturbed internally. When the sun&#39;s energy is affected by evil, headaches occur in the upper part. The hand&#39;s sun channel runs through the throat and down to the diaphragm, while the hand&#39;s lesser yin channel emerges from the heart and connects to the diaphragm and small intestine. When there is an issue in the diaphragm, it indicates problems in the hand&#39;s sun and lesser yin channels.</p>
<p>When the green pulse is prominent, it is long and bouncy. If there is accumulated energy below the heart, it signifies a condition called liver phlegm. This arises from cold dampness and is treated similarly to hernias. Symptoms include lower back pain, cold feet, and headaches.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pulse is long and bouncy, tight and urgent. A tight pulse indicates a deficiency, while urgency points to cold. This results from cold dampness affecting the yang energy, causing a tight and urgent pulse. The area below the heart corresponds to the diaphragm, while below the ribs corresponds to the sides. When evil is between the diaphragm and the ribs, the pulse shows bounciness to the left and right. For individuals experiencing cold dampness, the treatment must start from the feet. The lesser yin pulse travels from the feet up through the back of the knees into the hair, passing the genital area, reaching the lower abdomen, and spreading across the sides, thus indicating symptoms similar to hernia pain, along with lower back pain and cold feet. The lesser yin and governor vessels meet at the apex, leading to headaches.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The head is the organ of spirit and clarity; when the head tilts, vision becomes profound, and the spirit may be lost. If the strength is gained, life is sustained; if the strength is lost, death follows. </p>
<p>(Note: The essence of various Yang energies converges at the head, and the essence of the marrow gathers in the brain; hence, the head is regarded as the organ of essence, marrow, and spirit. If the sea of marrow is insufficient, the head tilts; if the spirit and energy are weak, vision becomes deep and the eyes sunken. Gaining strong visceral energy sustains life; losing strength leads to visceral damage and impending death.)</p>
<p>Pushing outward, yet not outside, indicates a build-up in the abdomen. Pushing inward, yet not inside, indicates body heat. Pushing upward, yet not downward, indicates that the lower back and legs are clear. Pushing downward, yet not upward, indicates pain in the head and neck.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Pushing&quot; refers to assessing the pulse&#39;s tendency to favor outside, inside, or top to bottom. When pushing outward, using three fingers on each side to apply pressure outward, if the pulse is stronger inward, there is a build-up of pathology in the abdomen. When pushing inward, using three fingers on each side to feel inward, if the pulse is stronger outward, there is an external pathology causing body heat. When pushing upward, pressing with three fingers evenly, if there’s no response downward, the energy is strong upwards and weak below, indicating the lower back and legs are clear. When pushing downward, if there’s no response upward, the energy is strong downwards and weak above, indicating pain in the head and neck.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Theory of the Pulse at the Wrist</p>
<p>When the pulse at the wrist is short, it indicates a headache.<br>[Note: This is to examine external causes of illness through the wrist pulse. The wrist represents the Yang, and the elbow represents the Yin. A short pulse at the wrist is only found in the Yang portion, therefore indicating a headache.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Pathology of Internal Organs</strong></p>
<p>For those suffering from liver disease, pain is felt under the ribs and extends to the lower abdomen, leading to irritability. When the liver is in deficiency, the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, and there is a constant fear as if one is being hunted. When qi is reversed, there are headaches, deafness, and swelling of the cheeks. </p>
<p>[<em>Note: The patient suffers from evils manifesting with symptoms. The liver meridians run along the sides and connect to the lower abdomen, which is why there is pain under the ribs extending to the lower abdomen. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that when liver qi is excessive, it leads to anger. The liver stores blood and opens to the eyes; therefore, deficiency leads to impaired vision. The Shaoyang meridian enters the ear, hence the inability to hear. For those with gallbladder disease, there is a feeling of emptiness below the heart, as if one is being captured. The Jueyin and Governing Vessel meet at the crown, causing headaches from reversed liver qi, while reversed Shaoyang qi causes deafness and swelling of the cheeks.</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Exposition on the Five Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the five evils disturb the body, if the evil enters the yang, it causes madness; if it enters the yin, it causes stagnation. If it assaults the yang, it results in headaches; if it assaults the yin, it results in muteness.</p>
<p>[<em>Note: When evil enters the yang, it leads to excessive yang, and if the yin cannot withstand it, the pulse becomes thin and may cause madness. When the evil enters the yin, it becomes blocked and stagnant, resulting in pain. If the evil qi collides with yang qi above, it causes headaches. The Shaoyin channel connects to the tongue, linking to the coccyx and ending at the epiglottis. If the evil collides with the yin, it obstructs the epiglottis from functioning, causing one to be unable to swallow and thus leading to muteness.</em>]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Theory of Reality and Illusion</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: If the pulse is strong and full, the hands and feet are cold, and the head is hot, what does this indicate? Qi Bo replied: In spring and autumn, life arises; in winter and summer, death occurs. If the pulse is floating and weak, and if it is weak with heat in the body, this indicates death. The Emperor asked: What if the form is entirely full? Qi Bo replied: When the form is entirely full, the pulse is rapid, large, and firm, with a weak Chi at the wrist that does not respond. In such cases, if one follows it, there will be life; if one opposes it, there will be death. The Emperor asked: What does it mean that following brings life and opposing brings death? Qi Bo replied: Following means that the hands and feet are warm. Opposing means that the hands and feet are cold. </p>
<p>[Note: The kidneys govern the origin of vital energy, and the bladder is associated with the sun&#39;s yin. A strong and full pulse indicates that the cold energy of the lesser yin permeates outward. Cold hands and feet suggest that the life force of the lesser yin is deficient within. A hot head indicates an excess of the sun&#39;s energy rising above. The interplay of yin and yang between the kidneys and bladder governs vital energy; when this is abundant externally, it leads to deficiency internally. In spring, yang energy slightly rises while yin energy slightly descends; in autumn, yin energy slightly rises while yang energy slightly descends. These two energies nourish and support each other, hence sustaining life. In winter, the external expression of yin energy is complete; in summer, the internal expression of yang energy is fully weak, hence leading to death. This indicates the essential vitality of yin and yang, which must not be allowed to become depleted.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Heat in the Liver Chapter</strong></p>
<p>In cases of liver heat disease, the first sign is yellow urine, with abdominal pain leading to excessive lying down and a feeling of body heat; when the heat conflicts, there are wild words and fright, fullness and pain in the sides, restlessness in the hands and feet, and an inability to lie peacefully. If the heat is severe, there will be significant sweating. If the qi goes against the flow, it can lead to death. Should it reverse, there will be a heavy headache. The pulse rises to the head.</p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the heat originating from internal causes. &quot;First&quot; refers to the initial presence of such internal heat manifested in these symptoms. The liver is responsible for regulation, thus the yellow urine. The liver channel connects to the lower abdomen, hence the abdominal pain. The liver houses the soul, and if the soul is harmed, it leads to excessive lying down; since wood and fire are responsible for qi, there is body heat. This indicates an internal disease starting in the qi level, moving from inside to outside, and being influenced by external pathogens, affecting the five organs and contending with internal heat, leading to harm to the soul and wild words, since the liver houses the soul. The liver, associated with the east and wood, manifests through fright. The liver channel runs through the sides, hence the fullness and pain there. If the wind and heat of wood are strong, it leads to restlessness in the limbs. When a person lies down, blood returns to the liver; if the liver qi is damaged and cannot accept the blood, it results in an inability to lie down.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The metal of Geng and Xin controls the wood of the liver, which is why it is so harsh. Geng and Xin do not perish; they begin with Jia and Yi. When there is great sweating, it indicates a proper defeat of the邪 (pathogenic factor) that is expelled outward. When qi is rebellious, it means the heat is excessive and turns inward, causing repression. The term &quot;yuan yuan&quot; signifies circulation. The heat of the liver manifests outwardly and corresponds with the body&#39;s heat; when the heat is excessive, it reverses upwards to the head, resulting in headaches and circular sensations. Indeed, the three yang channels ascend to the head, where the heat of the liver conflicts with the lesser yang, causing the pulse to force upwards to the head.</p>
<p>In cases of heart heat disease, there is initially a lack of joy, followed by several days of heat. When the heat contends, sudden heart pain arises, along with restlessness, tendency to vomit, headache, reddening of the face, and absence of sweating. When Ren and Gui are severe, and Bing and Ding are in great sweat, if qi rebels, then Ren and Gui perish.</p>
<p>Note: The heart’s will is joy, and fear can overcome it. A lack of initial joy suggests injury from fear. This indicates inner heat affected by external邪, causing internal conflicts. The heat dries out the spirit and the heart, resulting in sudden distress and pain. In cases of lesser yin disease, there is a desire to vomit but little ability to do so, hence the tendency to retch. The heart is the sun among the yang, thereby causing headaches. The radiance of the heart is reflected in the face, hence the reddening. The heart governs blood, which explains the absence of sweating.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The water of Ren and Gui overcomes the fire of the heart, thus it is severe. When Ren and Gui do not perish, they arise from Bing and Ding. A big sweat indicates the proper victory over the evil and an outward release. If it reverses, death will ensue.</p>
<p>In cases of heat illness affecting the spleen, there is a heavy feeling in the head, pain in the cheeks, vexation of the heart, a bluish face, a desire to vomit, and body heat; when heat contends, there is pain in the waist that limits bending and stretching, fullness in the abdomen, diarrhea, and pain in both jaws. When the illness is serious with Jia and Yi, there is great sweating from Wu and Ji. If the qi is reversed, then Jia and Yi will perish.</p>
<p>[Note: Yin qi rises from the feet to the head, hence the heavy feeling in the head. The Yangming channel runs along the cheeks, resulting in cheek pain. The spleen is connected to the heart, leading to heart vexation and a bluish face. The heat evil harms the stomach, causing nausea; the spleen governs the muscles, hence causing body heat. In Yang diseases, the waist bends inwards and cannot lean forward, while in Yin diseases, it cannot lean back. The struggle between Yin and Yang inside and outside results in waist pain that restricts bending and stretching. The abdomen is the fortress of the spleen-earth, thus causing fullness and diarrhea. The aggressive qi of the stomach rises to the head, affecting the jawbone, hence the pain in the jaw. In spleen diseases, the effects are intensified with Jia and Yi; Jia and Yi do not perish but arise from Wu and Ji.]<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>If there is rebellion and internal disruption in the organs, then one cannot go out and sweat to resolve it. In the case of lung heat disease, one first experiences a prickling sensation with the hairs standing on end, aversion to wind and cold, a yellow tongue, and body heat; when heat intensifies, it leads to wheezing and coughing, pain in the chest and back, inability to take a deep breath, unbearable headaches, and sweating accompanied by coldness. If the condition is severe, it can cause excessive sweating. If there is a reversal of energy flow, it may lead to severe consequences. </p>
<p>(Note: The skin and hair are connected to the lungs; heat within causes a prickling chill on the outside and aversion to wind and cold, as severe heat can lead to coldness. The lung connects to the throat, hence the yellow tongue. The internal heat and external pathogenic heat interact destructively within the lungs, causing wheezing and coughing with difficulty in breathing. The lungs govern the air flow in the chest; hence, energy disruption leads to pain in the chest and back. Among the five organs, the lungs respond to the heavens, and the hand&#39;s Yangming channel travels upward to the head, causing unbearable headaches. The internal struggle of heat leads to sweating while still feeling cold. The case of lung metal disease is countered by the fire of Bing and Ding; if their energy does not perish, it means the right energy prevails and is expelled. If there is a reversal of energy flow, one may die when facing a critical defeat.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What causes pain when there is heat in the body? Qi Bo replied: Heat in the body is due to the Yang channels, arising from the movement of the Three Yangs. The pulse at the wrist shows a strong Shaoyang, a very strong Taiyang, and a strong Yangming, indicating an entry into Yin. When Yang enters Yin, the illness manifests in the head and abdomen, causing distention in the abdomen and headache.</p>
<p><strong>[Note</strong>: Heat in the body signifies the prevalence of Yang channels. When Yang channels are strong, it is the movement of the Three Yangs that causes illness. When all three Yangs are strong, they dominate the condition of heat and headache. The abdomen is Yin, and within Yin, the most Yin is the spleen. As Yang enters Yin, the illness affects the head and abdomen, thus leading to abdominal distention and headache. The essence is that Yang entering Yin concerns the energy of the Three Yangs, not the meridians of the Three Yangs. If the illness is in the meridians and descends to the inner Yin, there would be pain without distention. In this case, the illness is in the Qi phase, and Yang energy enters the abdomen, resulting in distention without pain.]**<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>When the wind energy ascends from the Wind Palace, it can lead to “brain wind.” If the wind enters and affects the head, this results in “eye wind” causing coldness in the eyes. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The Wind Palace refers to an acupuncture point located at the back of the neck, which connects to the governing vessel, a meeting point of yang energy, thus the wind energy reaching the Wind Palace and following the meridians leads to brain wind. The foot yang channels communicate with the brain, which relates to the eyes; this is called eye connection. Since the foot yang associated with cold water governs energy, this leads to eye coldness.]</strong></p>
<p>When one is freshly bathed and encounters wind, it causes “head wind.” The symptoms of head wind include excessive sweating on the head and face, a dislike of wind; if exposed to wind for one day, the illness worsens, and one suffers from headaches that prevent them from leaving the house. When the day of wind arrives, the illness tends to improve.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: To bathe is to wash the head with water. After a fresh wash, the hair follicles open, so when wind enters the skin of the head, it results in head wind. The head is the meeting place of various yang energies; thus, when freshly bathed, the skin on the head is relaxed, which allows for excessive sweating and a dislike of wind. Wind represents the celestial yang energy and the human yang energy; in response to the heavenly wind, the various yang energies emit from the head. Therefore, if the exposure occurs one day prior, the illness worsens, as the wind is about to manifest and the energy becomes ill. On the day the wind manifests, the energy disperses with the wind, hence the illness improves a little.]</strong><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>On Syncope</strong></p>
<p>When the Great Yang experiences syncope, the head swells, it feels heavy, and the feet cannot move. This results in fainting. 【Note: Great Yang refers to the Sun. The Foot-Sun Meridian starts from the inner canthus of the eye, crosses over the forehead to the crown, enters the brain, then exits and branches down the neck, following the back alongside the spine, reaches the lower back, passes through the buttocks, enters the knee pit, and moves along the inner aspect to exit behind the outer ankle. Therefore, when there is syncope due to an upward disturbance, it causes head swelling and headache. When the disturbance is downward, it leads to inability to walk, and when the spirit and energy are confused, it results in fainting. The Sun is the master of all Yang energies; thus, this ailment is rooted in the meridian and affects the energy division, hence it is referred to as fainting.】<br><strong>On Uncommon Diseases</strong><a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The Emperor said: If a person suffers from headaches that do not cease for several years, what could be the cause of this? What is the name of this illness? Qi Bo replied: This is due to an offense against great cold, penetrating to the bone marrow. The marrow is primarily associated with the brain; when the brain is affected, it results in headaches and tooth pain. The illness is termed &quot;Jue Ni&quot; (Counterflow).</p>
<p>[This discusses the illness of the brain and marrow. On Earth, it corresponds to water; in the heavens, it corresponds to cold. Cold produces water, water produces salinity, and salinity nourishes the kidneys, which in turn create the bone marrow. Therefore, due to the offense of great cold penetrating to the bone marrow, all marrow is associated with the brain, hence the brain is considered the main organ. When the evil of the marrow rises against the brain, it causes persistent headaches for several years. Teeth are the extensions of the bones, thus they also experience pain. Cold enters from below and rises to the top, hence it is termed &quot;Counterflow.&quot;]</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding the discussion on pulses:</p>
<p>The Yangming so-called &quot;Guest Sun Pulse,&quot; indicates that when headaches, nasal obstruction, and abdominal swelling occur, Yangming is concentrated above. The above pertains to its Sun collateral branch linked to the Taiyin. Hence, there are headaches, nasal obstruction, and abdominal swelling. </p>
<p>[Note: This exemplifies the dynamics of Yin and Yang, as well as the rise and fall of energies, and the internal and external exchanges flowing in the pulse&#39;s external energy level. The energy level refers to the space between the skin and muscles. &quot;Above&quot; refers to the external surface of the skin. All the pulses represented as floating and commonly observed are collateral pulses. The pulse of Foot Taiyin also appears on the skin&#39;s surface without concealment. Therefore, when the Yangming energy converges at the top, it exerts pressure on the collateral of Yangming, linking with the Taiyin meridian. When pressured by Yangming&#39;s Sun collateral, headaches and nasal obstruction occur, and abdominal swelling is due to pressure from the Taiyin meridian.]<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Seasonal Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>When the sun is weak, diseases accumulate; this leads to conditions of the head. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A weak constitution signifies an abundance of blood but a lack of qi, with some coldness present, referred to as blood disease. When blood accumulates and coagulates, it causes a buildup.</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Symptom Transmission</strong></p>
<p>In liver disease, there is dizziness, fullness in the sides. After three days, the body feels heavy and painful; after five days, there is bloating; after three days, there are pains in the waist, spine, lower abdomen, and soreness in the legs. If not resolved in three days, it leads to death. When winter comes, early summer eating occurs. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the disease first attacks the liver, dizziness and fullness in the sides occur. After three days, it affects the spleen, causing body heaviness and pain. After five days, it affects the stomach, leading to bloating. After three days, it affects the kidneys, resulting in pain in the waist, spine, and lower abdomen. If unresolved in three days, it leads to death. Early summer eating refers to the hours of the tiger and rabbit, during which wood qi is exhausted and does not flourish. When winter comes, it refers to the hours of the monkey and rooster, during which metal qi is strong and wood qi is exhausted.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>On the Variations of Qi and Its Effects</strong></p>
<p>When the energy of wood is excessively strong in the year, the wind energy circulates widely, affecting the earth element, causing the people to suffer from symptoms such as diarrhea, reduced appetite, heaviness and discomfort in the body, rumbling intestines, and a full abdomen. This corresponds to the star of the year. In severe cases, there may be sudden anger and symptoms like dizziness and head ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the energy of wood is too strong, it overwhelms the earth element, leading to ailments of the spleen. Symptoms like diarrhea, reduced appetite, abdominal rumbling, and fullness are all indicative of spleen disorders. The spleen governs the muscles and limbs, hence the heaviness and discomfort. This is due to the earth being harmed and unable to control water, causing water energy to rise and affect the heart. The star of the year refers to Jupiter, which influences wood. Excessive wood energy corresponds to the years of the Ren. If too much is in excess, it ultimately harms oneself. Sudden anger indicates a disturbance of the liver’s energy. The Jueyin and the Governor Vessel converge at the crown of the head, hence the symptoms of dizziness and head ailments.</p>
<p>When the energy of metal is insufficient in the year, the fire energy prevails, leading to the stagnation of the yin, causing the yang to become excessive. Symptoms include pain in the head and temples, extending to warmth at the crown, along with mouth sores and, in severe cases, heart pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the years of Liu Yi, the energy of metal is insufficient, allowing the fire energy that it should control to prevail. When metal is weak and fire is excessive, water is consequently restored. During autumn and winter, the yang energy is supposed to be stored in the yin organs. However, due to the reversal of cold energy, the yang becomes stagnant externally, which causes the yang to ascend, resulting in head pain and warmth at the crown. The cold water energy rises and forces the heart fire outward, leading to the people suffering from mouth sores and, in severe cases, heart pain.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>The Great Discussion on the Five Constants and Governance</strong></p>
<p>When wood is excessive, it is said to generate. The time of generation is called the emergence of patterns. When earth is dispersed and leaking, the verdant energy reaches out, the Yang harmony spreads and transforms, and the Yin energy follows. Vital energy is pure and transformative, and all things thrive. Their transformation is life-giving, their energy is beautiful, their governance is dispersed, their regulations are clear, their movements are falling, dizzying, and swift. The meridians connect to Jueyin and Shaoyang, their organs are the liver and spleen, and their illness manifests as anger. The Great Horn corresponds with the Upper Merchants. When the upper is called to action, its energy is reversed, and the illness manifests as vomiting or diarrhea.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The Emperor said: How does the governance of the Great Yang correspond to the transformations of the Five Movements? Qi Bo replied: It pertains to the cycles of the Chen and Xu. At the start of this phase, the energy of the earth shifts, a great warmth prevails, the grass flourishes early, the people become weakened, and warm diseases begin to manifest, presenting as fever, headaches, nausea, and skin sores.</p>
<p>[Note: The Five Movements refers to the transformations of the five elements. The years of Chen and Xu govern the emergence of Great Yang energy. The initial energy begins in the Lesser Yang phase. The shifting energy of the earth refers to the concluding energy of the previous year, which transitions to the initial energy of this year&#39;s governance; the ending energy of the previous year corresponds to the Lesser Yin Fire, while the initial energy of this year corresponds to the Lesser Yang Fire. The intermingling of these two fires causes a great warmth, leading to early flourishing of plants; thus, in spring, as transition occurs and warmth increases, the populace suffers illnesses characterized by fever, headaches, nausea, and sores.]</p>
<p>The governance of the Lesser Yang pertains to the cycles of Yin and Shen. At the onset of this phase, the energy of the earth shifts, the winds govern and sway, the cold departs, the atmosphere turns noticeably warm, and the grass and trees flourish early; the cold does not destroy, and warm diseases arise. The symptoms of these illnesses manifest as stagnation in the upper body, blood congestion leading to red eyes, coughing and reverse headaches, uterine bleeding, and fullness in the sides, alongside skin sores.</p>
<p>[Note: The initial energy during this phase corresponds to the Lesser Yin Fire, while the primary energy is governed by the Jue Yin Wind Wood. Hence, the winds sway and the atmosphere becomes warm; the grass and trees receive the energy for growth and flourish early. The Lesser Yang governs the heavens while the fire of the Lord is in charge of the energy; therefore, even when the cold comes, it cannot extinguish the warmth of the two fires. Symptoms like blood congestion leading to red eyes, coughing and headaches, and skin sores are all illnesses caused by wind and fire.]<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p>
<h3>The Essential Discussion on Ultimate Truth</h3>
<p>In the year when the Taiyin is in the springs, the grass blooms early, and when dampness prevails, dust darkens the valleys, making the yellow appear black. At the time of extreme yin, the people suffer from headaches. </p>
<p>(Note: When the Taiyin is in the springs, it refers to the years of Chen and Xu. It governs the nourishment of plants, hence the early blooming of grass. Yellow represents the color of earth, and black the color of water; since earth overcomes dampness, yellow appears as black. The time of extreme yin coincides with the interplay of the three and four qi. The people&#39;s headaches are related to bladder meridian pain. The bladder is the organ of water’s essence; when the earth qi overwhelms dampness, both the water organs and passages become ill.)</p>
<p>When the Taiyin governs the heavens and dampness prevails, there are symptoms of swelling, bone pain, and yin obstruction. Yin obstruction means that pressure cannot alleviate it, resulting in pain in the lower back, spine, head, and neck, accompanied by dizziness and difficulty in defecation. </p>
<p>(Note: When the Taiyin governs the heavens, it refers to the years of Chou and Wei. Swelling and yin obstruction result from exposure to cold and damp qi. When the illness pertains to yin, it is called obstruction, hence it cannot be alleviated by pressure. The kidneys govern bones and the bladder is their organ; thus, pain occurs in the lower back, spine, and head. The kidneys open to the two yin, which explains the difficulty in defecation.)</p>
<p>When the Shaoyang governs the heavens and fire prevails, the people suffer from headaches, fever, and chills, as well as intermittent fever. </p>
<p>(Note: When the Shaoyang governs the heavens, it refers to the years of Yin and Shen.)<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The fire of the lesser yang, manifests as heat in the heavens, causing the people to suffer from headaches, chills, fevers, and intermittent fevers. The greater yang controls the heavens; when the cold overcomes, the blood alters internally, resulting in abscesses. People suffer from heart pain, vomiting blood, blood-related disorders, sneezing, nosebleeds, and frequent fainting spells. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How do the six energies interact? Qibo replied: The dominance of the jueyin leads to tinnitus, dizziness, a sensation of wanting to vomit, cold in the stomach, and frequent strong winds.</p>
<p>The three yin and three yang govern the seasonal energies; when an excess leads to illness among the people, it is prudent to balance it with the corresponding flavors. Tinnitus and dizziness relate to the ascending wood energy. Nausea indicates cold in the stomach, hence the stomach&#39;s disturbance. Frequent strong winds indicate an excess below trying to rise.</p>
<p>The dominance of the taiyin results in internal fire stagnation, ulcers developing internally and spreading outward, with ailments in the sides and ribs, leading to severe heart pain, hot sensations, headaches, throat constriction, and stiff neck. Pure domination brings dampness to stagnate internally and cold that presses on the lower body, causing pain that lingers at the crown, drawing tight between the eyebrows, fullness in the stomach, warmth in the feet, heaviness of the head, and swelling of the lower legs. </p>
<p>Fluid accumulation emerges internally, resulting in swelling above. The return of the taiyin transforms dampness leading to heaviness and fullness in the body, leading to indigestion and upward disruption of yin energy.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>In the chest there is discomfort, fluids accumulating within, causing coughing and wheezing, along with a heavy pain in the head and neck, with dizziness especially severe. </p>
<p>(Note: When external dampness pervades, internal fire becomes constrained and leads to sores within. When damp-heat spreads outward, it reaches the wind and wood, causing illness in the ribs and flanks. If it worsens, it can result in heart pain as wood overwhelms and transmits to fire. Heat causes headaches, throat constriction, and neck stiffness, as the air of wind and fire mixes with dampness, rising from the neck to the crown. This dominance arises from excessive dampness persisting for a year and a half. </p>
<p>Dampness in the center drives internal pressure downwards, causing pain that lingers at the crown and pulls between the eyebrows, as wind and fire linger at the crown and transmit to the Yangming channel, reaching the stomach and causing fullness. A warm head and heavy body below indicate that the wind and fire are flowing downwards. </p>
<p>Fluids accumulating within and swelling upwards are due to water rising from below through the center to the top. Furthermore, the energies of three Yin and three Yang being influenced by the dominating energies can cause a resurgence of repressed illness. </p>
<p>Pain in the head and neck with severe dizziness is attributed to dampness, with a sensation as if wrapped. When damp-heat is not dispelled, the large muscles become weak and short, while the small muscles are lax and long; weakness denotes tightness whereas elongation indicates atrophy.) </p>
<p>The victory of the Yang contrasts, gathering frost and arriving, with heat rising upward, causing pain in the head, neck, and crown, as well as within the brain.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>When the Taiyang (greater yang) phase returns, its qi rises upwards. The heart and stomach become cold, the chest and diaphragm are obstructed, leading to heart pain and fullness; headaches accompanied by sadness occur, and at times one may feel dizzy and faint. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The cold water qi of Taiyang prevails, thus causing congestion and arriving at its peak. The heat rising upwards indicates that Taiyang&#39;s qi rises through the meridians to enter the brain and then emerges again from the lower neck. The qi rising upwards signifies stagnated qi that ascends, desiring to revert to the condition before mid-year. The cold in the heart and stomach, obstruction of the chest and diaphragm, heart pain and fullness, headaches with sadness, and occasional dizziness, result from the upward movement of qi that starts from below, moves to the center, and then ascends.</p>
<p>When the Yangming (bright yang) phase returns, the clear qi surges strongly. Illness manifests as pain in the flanks, with qi returning to the left side, often leading to deep sighing; in severe cases, there is heart pain and fullness, abdominal distension and diarrhea, bitterness in vomiting, cough and vexation, with illness in the lower abdomen, accompanied by headaches.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The return of Yangming occurs at the time when its governing forces are in place; thus, illness arises in the flanks, with qi returning to the left, as metal surpasses wood. Heart pain, fullness, abdominal swelling, and diarrhea occur as fire overcomes earth. Those with gallbladder issues tend to sigh deeply. Bitter vomiting occurs when wood bears the punishment of metal, and organs may also be affected. Coughing and vexation indicate the qi of the lungs is in rebellion. The painful cough and mental vexation signify that the illness is within the lower abdomen, while headaches relate to Jueyin (reverting yin) disorders.</p>
<p>Jueyin governs the sky; when the host overcomes, one experiences ringing in the ears and dizziness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The guest energy of the wind and wood exceeds the upper energy, hence there are symptoms like ear ringing and dizziness. When the lesser yin governs the heavens, if the guest energy is dominant, there will be sneezing, stiff neck, heat in the shoulders and back, and headaches. The initial qi of the lesser yin is the cold water of the greater yang; the second qi is the wind and wood of the greater yin; the third qi is the fire of the lesser yin lord. Sneezing, deafness, and closed eyes indicate the dominance of the greater yin energy. A stiff neck, heat in the shoulders and back, and headache indicate the predominance of the greater yang energy.</p>
<p>When the lesser yang governs the heavens, if the guest energy is dominant, this will lead to rashes on the skin, skin boils, nausea, throat obstruction, and headaches. The initial qi of the lesser yang consists of the two fires of the lord and minister; the second qi is the damp earth of the greater yin. The skin rashes are caused by heat manifesting outwardly. Skin boils and throat swelling along with headaches are also symptoms arising from damp heat, affecting the body from the top down and from the outside in.</p>
<p>The arrival of the three yang energies singularly indicates that they have come together as one. When the three yangs are united, the yang energy rises, causing symptoms at the top, while it descends causing leakage at the bottom.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>On Composure</strong></p>
<p>The Thunder Lord said: Here there are those with headaches, muscle spasms, heavy bones, timorousness, and shortness of breath, who experience belching and abdominal fullness, and are startled at times, showing little desire to sleep. What organ causes this? The pulse is floating and string-like, palpated like stone; one does not understand the cause, and again inquires about the three organs to discern the relationship. The Emperor said: This is called composure. In older years, inquiry should go to the viscera; in youth, it should go to the channels; in adulthood, it should go to the organs. What you describe is all erroneous: the Eight Winds are causing damp heat, the Five Organs are deteriorating, and evil influences interact with each other. A floating and string-like pulse indicates kidney deficiency. A sinking and stone-like pulse indicates internal obstruction of kidney qi. Timorousness and shortness of breath indicate that the water pathway is not functioning well, leading to diminished vital energy. Coughing and vexation indicate the reversal of kidney qi. The essence of an individual’s qi resides in one organ. If one claims that all three organs are affected, it is contrary to the method. </p>
<p>[Note: The Jueyin root arises from the Dadu point, with qi connecting to the governing vessel at the vertex and governing the muscles, hence the headache and muscle spasms result from Jueyin channel pathology. The Shaoyin root arises from the Yongquan point, being the source of life qi and governing the bones, hence the heavy bones and shortness of breath result from Shaoyin channel pathology. The Taiyin root arises from the Yinbai point, linked to the stomach via membranes; thus belching and abdominal fullness, along with edginess and lack of sleep, result from Taiyin channel pathology. The floating pulse is an opening pulse. The string-like pulse is the pivot pulse; the stone-like pulse is the closing pulse. Since the Thunder Lord does not understand the cause, he inquires further about the pulse signs of the three organs to discern their relationships in obscurity.]<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The one who is composed is called &quot;qi,&quot; indicating that the meridians should seek it in qi. The three Yin are the elder female, middle female, and younger female. The太阴 (Great Yin) corresponds to the elder female, thus it should be sought in the Fu (organs), where yang predominates and opens. The少阴 (Lesser Yin) corresponds to the younger female, so it should be sought in the channels, where the qi internally connects to the organs and externally links to the body, governing the mechanisms of entry and exit. The厥阴 (Rebellious Yin) is located at the intersection of the two Yin, corresponding to the middle female, thus it is sought in the organs, where Yin prevails and governs closure. This corresponds to the qi of the three Yin, as seen in symptoms like headaches and muscle spasms. The pulse is floating and string-like, hence one should seek the opening and closing mechanisms of the three Yin qi. If one only discusses pulse symptoms, it does not reflect composure. The eight winds disperse heat, causing a person’s yang qi to circulate above, below, and on all sides. The five organs become consumed, allowing the transmission of pathogenic factors, described as the qi of the five elements, interconnected within the cosmos, with interactions of generation and overcoming. The floating and string-like pulse signifies the deficiency of the kidney qi arising from the liver and spleen. The sinking and stone-like pulse indicates that the qi of the liver and spleen descends to the kidney, marking the internal engagement of kidney qi. The water in the spring flows according to the qi in the heavens, thus those who are timid and low in qi experience blocked waterways, leading to the depletion of qi in the body. Coughing and restlessness indicate the upward reversal of kidney qi towards the heart and lungs. The three Yin of the five organs ultimately unify into one qi, which then connects and permeates through the five organs. Understanding the interplay of heaven&#39;s dao, where qi exchanges between Yin and Yang, is essential for following the composed middle path. If one claims that the liver, spleen, and kidney operate together, it does not conform to the principles of Yin and Yang&#39;s separation and combination.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Prosperity and Decline</h3>
<p>When the Qi rises and does not descend, it causes headaches and vertex disorders.<br><em>Note: Qi refers to the Yang energy. When it rises and does not descend, it causes headaches and vertex disorders. The Yang energy rises straight up from below to the apex.</em></p>
<h4>The Book of the Spiritual Pivot</h4>
<h5>The Final and Initial Chapters</h5>
<p>Illness arising from the head causes a feeling of heaviness in the head.<br><em>Note: The Qi of heaven and earth in all directions has its foundational cause; hence illness arising in the head manifests as heaviness.</em></p>
<h5>The Channels and Meridians Chapter</h5>
<p>The Bladder channel of the Foot Taiyang begins at the inner canthus of the eye and ascends to the vertex; its branch extends from the vertex to the ear&#39;s upper corner; the main path enters the brain from the vertex, exits at the lower occiput, runs along the shoulders, is bound on the spine, reaches the lower back, travels to the lumbar region, connects with the kidney, and belongs to the bladder. This movement can result in headaches, a feeling of detachment in the eyes, and stiffness in the neck. It governs diseases arising from the tendons, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, manic episodes, headaches, and pain in the occipital and neck regions.</p>
<p>The Gallbladder channel of the Foot Shaoyang begins at the outer canthus of the eye, ascends to the head corner, descends behind the ear, runs along the neck moving towards the Hand Shaoyang in front, reaches the shoulder and then branches out behind the Hand Shaoyang, entering the supraclavicular fossa; its branch goes from behind the ear, enters the ear canal, exits in front of the ear, and reaches the outer canthus of the eye. It governs diseases arising from the bones, such as headaches, jaw pain, pain at the outer canthus of the eye, and swelling and pain in the supraclavicular fossa.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p>
<h3>Sea of Marrow</h3>
<p>The brain is the sea of marrow; its ascendant flow is at its crown, while the descendant flow is at the Wind Pool below. When the sea of marrow is abundant, one is light, vigorous, and strong, surpassing usual limits; when the sea of marrow is insufficient, there are dizzy spells, ringing in the ears, weakness in the legs, blurred vision, and a tendency to be lethargic and prone to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The brain, as the sea of marrow, receives energy that is constrained by it. Thus, its ascendant flow is at the crown, and the descent is at the Wind Pool in the Governing Vessel, connecting the sea of marrow above to the spiritual essence below. The essence nourishes the brain marrow and flows down to the Yin region; hence, when the sea of marrow is abundant, the legs are light and filled with strength. &quot;Limits&quot; refers to the capacity of the bones. Marrow travels from the bone cavities circling the limits upward to the brain; thus, when abundant, it transcends normal limits. If the sea of marrow is deficient, the bodily fluids deplete. The essential fluids are what moisten the openings; thus, the ears ring and vision fails. When liquids are depleted, the bones are impaired in flexibility, resulting in weak legs and a tendency towards fatigue and restfulness.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>The Five Disturbances</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The twelve meridians correspond to the five elements and are divided into the four seasons. What leads to disorder? What brings about harmony? Qi Bo replied: The five elements are in order, the four seasons are distinct. When they are harmonized, there is order; when they are contrary, there is disorder. Therefore, if the Qi is disturbed in the heart, it leads to anxiety and silence, causing one to bow their head and remain still; if disturbed in the lungs, it leads to gasping and loud breathing, making one call for help; if disturbed in the intestines and stomach, it results in dysentery; if disturbed in the arms and legs, it causes syncope; if disturbed in the head, it leads to cessation of circulation, causing heaviness and dizziness.  </p>
<p><strong>The Great Delusion Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: I once ascended the cool and tranquil terrace, looking back and crawling forward, then became perplexed. I privately pondered this, secretly wondering about it. Alone in stillness, focusing my mind and calming my Qi, I remained perplexed for a long time. Alone in contemplation, feeling dizzy, with long hair disheveled, I knelt and looked down; afterward, it did not cease. Suddenly, from above, what Qi caused this? Qi Bo answered: The essence and Qi of the five organs and six viscera all ascend to the eyes, forming essence. They gather the essence of muscles, bones, and blood, merging with the meridians, ascending to the brain, and then exiting through the nape. Hence, when evil enters the nape and encounters one&#39;s physical void, if it penetrates deeply, it follows the eye&#39;s connection into the brain; once in the brain, the brain spins, and that causes the eyes to be urgently connected; when the eyes are urgently connected, they become dizzy and turn. </p>
<p><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong><a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The pulse comes with one breath and then returns, with one inhalation and then returns; it is neither too strong nor too weak, and is termed &quot;peaceful.&quot; If it comes three times with one breath and three times with one inhalation, it indicates a slight illness. If the front is large and the back small, it leads to headaches and dizziness; if the front is small and the back large, it leads to a feeling of fullness in the chest and shortness of breath. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A pulse that beats four times in a breath is the &quot;peaceful pulse.&quot; If it beats three times with one breath and three times with one inhalation, that totals six beats in one breath, which is two beats more than a normal person, hence it is termed a slight illness, not severe. The terms &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; do not refer to size, but rather describe their position at the beginning and end.</p>
<p><strong>Headache due to Cold</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse of the three Yang channels captures wind and cold which then lingers and does not disperse, it is called headache due to cold.</p>
<p><strong>True Headache</strong></p>
<p>When the pain is linked to the brain, it is termed true headache. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> True headache results in intense pain, penetrating the brain, leading to blue coloring of the hands and feet reaching the joints, and is fatal if untreated. The brain is considered the sea of marrow, where true Qi is concentrated; if it fails to resist pathogens, it will lead to death.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Chamber Essentials</strong> (Han Dynasty – Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>The teacher said: If the patient speaks in a sharp, fine, and drawn-out voice, there is pain in the head. In cases of Yang diseases, the eighteenth: headache, with pain in the neck, waist, spine, arms, and legs. If the pulse is tight, it indicates headache caused by wind and cold, and stagnation of undigested food in the abdomen. For those who experience dry heaving, vomiting foam, and headaches, the remedy is the Zhuyu Decoction. For those who are thirsty after vomiting, craving water, the remedy is the Wenguo Decoction, which also addresses mild wind pulse headache.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>All joints and limbs are painful, the body feels weak and frail, the feet are swollen as if dislocated, there is dizziness and shortness of breath, a sensation of warmth that makes one want to vomit. The prescription for this is Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of lung atrophy with phlegm and frothy sputum but no cough, the patient is not thirsty and must urinate frequently. The reason for this is that the weakness above cannot control the excess below. This indicates cold in the lungs, causing excessive salivation and dizziness; use Gancao Ganjiang Decoction to warm it. If upon taking the decoction the patient feels thirsty, it is classified as diabetes.</p>
<p>If there is phlegm and fluid under the heart, fullness in the chest and sides, and dizziness, the prescription is Linggui Zhuyuan Decoction. If there is fluid under the heart and the person suffers from dizziness and a sensation of heaviness, the prescription is Zexie Decoction.</p>
<p>Sudden vomiting, a sense of heaviness in the abdomen between the heart and diaphragm, accompanied by dizziness and palpitations, should be treated with Banxia Jia Fuling Decoction. </p>
<p>If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel, vomits frothy saliva, and suffers from dizziness, it is due to water retention; Wuling Powder is the remedy.</p>
<p>A tight pulse at the foot yang point indicates spleen damage caused by the interplay of wind and cold. If food is consumed, dizziness occurs; if the digestive Qi is not dissipated, it remains stagnant in the stomach, causing foul and turbid sensations and obstructed urination. The cold affects the Yin, heat flows to the bladder, and the body turns yellow, which is termed &quot;grain jaundice.&quot; </p>
<p>In cases where the pulse is slow in Yangming disease, it is difficult to eat until full; if full, there will be disturbance and dizziness, and urination will be difficult. This indicates the onset of grain jaundice; even if purged, the abdomen remains distended, because the pulse is slow. </p>
<p>The disease of grain jaundice manifests with cold and heat, loss of appetite, dizziness upon eating, and discomfort in the heart and chest. Prolonged symptoms leading to jaundice require treatment with Yinchenhao Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Head Shaking</strong></p>
<p>The patient has a warm body but cold feet, with a stiff and tense neck. They experience chills, occasional heat in the head, a flushed face, and red eyes, and their head shakes uncontrollably. If their mouth suddenly becomes locked and their back arches, this indicates tetanus. If sweating occurs, it is due to the combination of cold and dampness, leading to greater weakness on the surface, thus worsening the chills. After sweating, the pulse feels like that of a snake.</p>
<p><strong>Black Forehead</strong></p>
<p>In a yellow-sick individual, fever appears in the afternoon followed by chills, which can arise from excessive labor in women. They experience urgency in the bladder, fullness in the lower abdomen, and the entire body appears yellow. The forehead turns black, and the feet feel hot, leading to the formation of black jaundice. The abdomen appears distended like water, and the stools are dark and often loose. This condition related to excessive labor in women is not due to water retention. A distended abdomen is difficult to treat. The remedy consists of Glauber’s salt and alum powder.</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>If liver qi is rebellious, it leads to headaches, tinnitus, and a flushed face, with a pulse that is deep and rapid. A floating and rapid pulse indicates the same. This condition is associated with fullness in the sides and limbs, difficulty in urination, headache, and dizziness. If a headache persists for a long time and suddenly leads to blurred vision, it results in death.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Fever lasts three to five days, with headaches and body heat; if appetite remains normal but the pulse is fast and straight, death occurs on the eighth day.</p>
<p>For headache, if the pulse is slow and large, it leads to death.</p>
<p>If there is a deficiency of the gallbladder, it results in cold and fear, dizziness preventing independent lying down. If there is water in the gallbladder, swelling can occur from the head to the feet. When the upper burner is deficient, it cannot control the lower, leading to incontinence and facial swelling.</p>
<p>With excessive heat in the upper burner, sweating on the forehead occurs, with appetite intact but Qi obstructed, leading to a dry tongue, a parched mouth, and throat constriction, as well as abdominal distension and pain in the hypochondrium.</p>
<p>For headaches and eye pain, if the pulse is thin and short, it leads to death. Redness seen in the ears, eyes, or forehead leads to death in five days.</p>
<p>When there is difficulty in urination, bitter dizziness, headaches, and lumbar pain, if the foot&#39;s jueyin and shaoyang Qi are reversed, it results in headache, deafness, and facial swelling.</p>
<p>If the disease initially affects the liver, it presents as dizziness, pain in the hypochondria, and fullness. The liver pulse is deep and rapid, whether floating or sinking, alongside bitter pain beneath the ribs, with bloating and pain in the lower abdomen. When there&#39;s a wind in the liver, there is a quivering sensation in the head, pain in both sides, leading to a stooped posture, causing an abnormal craving for sweets akin to that of a blocked woman.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis (by Wang Shuhe from Jin Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headache that comes suddenly should be treated urgently; if it&#39;s due to wind and phlegm, it can easily be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions (by Sun Simiao from Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dizziness from Wind</strong></p>
<p>Xu Sibai said: The disease of dizziness from wind arises from unstable heart qi and accumulation of filth in the chest, which causes the sensation of a high wind and heat on the face. The interaction of phlegm and heat stirs the wind; when the wind and heart are in disarray, it results in confusion and dizziness, thus termed dizziness from wind. In adults, it is called mania, while in children it is termed epilepsy; essentially, they are the same. This prescription is sure to cure, but the concern is that if the symptoms are not properly assessed, it might lead to adverse outcomes. Generally, one should avoid eating all types of meat. Particularly, the consumption of pork may cause problems, leading to excessive gas and urgent respiratory difficulties, which can be fatal. Therefore, this decoction is suitable for both light and heavy conditions, and should not be dismissed hastily as non-serious. The prescribed remedies, including decoctions, powders, or pills can total ten varieties. For initial onset, it is advisable to administer the Sustained Life Decoction urgently. During an acute phase, one should promptly perform moxibustion on the acupoints and apply fire needles; there is no case of failure in recovery. Immediate needling should be followed by moxibustion for best results. The moxibustion methods will be listed afterward. Over the course of my thirty-plus years in practice, I have saved and revived countless patients, and all recovered. Future practitioners should understand this formula and avoid mixing it with my other techniques.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Jisheng Fang</strong><br><strong>[Song Dynasty - Yan Yonghe]</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of dizziness must be understood from both internal and external causes.</p>
<p>The <em>Suwen</em> states: All winds causing dizziness relate to the liver. Thus, it is known that liver wind attacking upwards must lead to dizziness. Dizziness is characterized by blurred vision and a sensation of spinning; when one rises, they feel faint. From this perspective, external six evils and internal seven emotions can both cause such conditions, and differentiation must be made between external signs and pulse. If affected by wind, the pulse is floating with sweating, and there is stiffness in the neck without sensation; if cold, the pulse is tight with no sweating, and there is cramping and pain in the muscles; if heat, the pulse is weak and there is restlessness; if dampness, the pulse is thin and heavy, with nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p>When affected by the seven emotions, it causes disharmony in the zàng organs, leading to phlegm production, which obstructs and causes rebellious qi, resulting in dizziness. This is accompanied by pain in the brow ridge and inability to open the eyes, along with a predominantly deep pulse, which indicates a different condition. </p>
<p>Moreover, excessive fatigue, deficiency in the lower regions and fullness in the upper, wounds leading to bleeding, or women experiencing blood loss during menstruation all result in dizziness. Each should be treated according to its cause; this is the effective method.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p>
<h3>Headache Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>The head is where all the yang energies converge, while all the yin meridians reach the neck and return. Only the yang meridians ascend to the head, indicating that the head and face belong to the yang region. In ordinary individuals, when yang flows upwards without obstruction, there will be no headache. However, if yang flows upwards against the natural order, it congests in the head, resulting in headaches. </p>
<p>Headaches can arise from wind and cold in the brain, evil heat attacking upwards, phlegm or kidney blockage, and deficiencies or aggressive qi, all of which lead to pain. The methods for treatment have already been discussed. Yet, in cases of qi deficiency or aggressive qi, headaches may improve momentarily only to return after a period of time. </p>
<p>For skewed or intense headaches, women with abundant qi but deficient blood, especially after significant blood loss during childbirth, may suffer from headaches as there is insufficient qi to govern. The &quot;Scorpio Appendage Pill&quot; effectively treats headaches caused by qi deficiency and aggressive qi, marvelously fitting the principles of transformation and creation. </p>
<p>Among the ingredients used, Aconite is included to bolster yang and support deficiency, while the use of rosin helps to replenish yang and stabilize. The whole scorpion signifies the penetrating nature necessary for treatment, and the use of scallion juice promotes the smooth flow of qi. </p>
<p>In soups, the addition of pepper and salt serves a purpose: pepper aids in penetrating downwards, and salt helps draw the deficient qi downwards—applying these based on the symptoms leads to effective results.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment of Headache</h3>
<p>Headaches are associated with the upper, where the yang meridians converge. Typically, headaches indicate a deficiency of blood and qi. External pathogens like wind, cold, heat, and dampness can injure the yang channels, leading to what is called &quot;obstructive headache.&quot; Obstruction signifies something reversed; it congests and pressures the head. Severe pain that radiates to the crown and causes coldness in the hands and feet is termed &quot;true headache,&quot; which cannot be cured by medicine. There are also conditions of wind-heat phlegm obstruction, qi deficiency kidney obstruction, and exposure to wind after bathing, all of which can lead to headaches. The treatment method should focus on identifying the source and adjusting accordingly, with no possibility of missing the mark.</p>
<h3>Scalp Abscess</h3>
<p>Scalp abscesses occur when yang is trapped and toxins rise to obstruct. They may appear at the end of the occipital bone or at the Fengchi point. The size and severity can vary, appearing as hard swellings that can eventually break down and spread through the hair, producing pain as if cut by a knife, with redness and swelling but no pus. If it is stubborn, yellow fluid may emerge; if it flows well, white pus may form. Treatments include Angelica, Chuanxiong, ginseng, red peony, Forsythia, Platycodon, Tianhuafen, Cimicifuga, wine-fried Scutellaria, gardenia, honeysuckle, astragalus, and dried kudzu root, among others, to create a harmonious treatment. Topically, use Zijingting water for application. For larger abscesses, apply a plaster three times daily and consider taking wax alum pills.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>This affliction appears at the back of the head. If it resembles a beehive, urgent measures should be taken to rescue the patient. If redness, swelling, and pain arise, treatment is possible; if phlegm develops, it will be difficult to treat, so prompt regulation is essential. If it flows to both shoulders, do not attempt treatment. The method of treatment is the same as for scalp ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Zhenju (Phlegm Abscess)</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from wind-heat attacking the interior, causing this abscess disease. The remedy should be adjusted according to the patient&#39;s age. Those over fifty find it hard to treat, while the young and strong can be treated. It is advisable to take internal Huanglian Decoction with ten or so doses, plus Qianghuo, Jin Yinhua, and Jingjie; alternatively, one could use Qianjin Tuo Li San. Additionally, one should take Huangfan Pills and apply Jin Si Ointment externally. The treatment method is the same as for oral ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This poison results from kidney deficiency, with excessive heat blocking the brain&#39;s orifices and forming hidden toxicity. In the initial three days, shave the hair and use moxa the size of a bean for five treatments, applying surrounding medicines externally to help dispel it. Use Sanxiang Neituo San and Dingtong Xiaodu Yin for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Oral Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from deficient Yang attacking upwards, causing heat to infiltrate the brain, leading to the formation of this abscess. It is located near the throat, a gathering place of Yang, and requires appropriate regulation. For initial treatment, use Qianjin Neituo San, adding Qianghuo, Duhuo, Chaihu, and Tianhuafen for decoction to help disperse the excess heat; then take Jingfang Baidu San and apply Jin Si Ointment externally. Furthermore, take Neituo Shixuan San with Bai Shao, Qianghuo, and Jin Yinhua for decoction, and utilize more Datuo Huangfan Pills and Huxin San.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Fringe Hair Issues</strong></p>
<p>This condition manifests on both sides of the nape, where the hair is affected. It arises suddenly and requires immediate treatment. If the hair is hard and brittle, it is urgent to address the root cause of the illness. If there is inflammation around the scalp, it indicates that heat has ascended, causing redness, swelling, and hardness extending to the ears and neck, accompanied by cold and hot pain. If not treated promptly, the toxicity will penetrate the blood and flesh, leading to putrefaction and pus. Cases involving bleeding from the head, breathlessness, or phlegm are difficult to treat. The treatment method remains the same, but adjustments with guiding herbs should be made.</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Head Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>This carbuncle relates to the six organs and arises from imbalances in Yin and Yang, leading to heat stagnating upwards and forming a fistula, which damages the brain&#39;s meridians. Therefore, the symptoms of toxicity should not be taken lightly; first, a remedy to dispel toxins and promote flow should be administered, followed by an internal remedy to promote flow and treat the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Hairline Poison</strong></p>
<p>This toxicity affects the Yangming meridian of the hand, resulting from deficiency of Qi and the upward obstruction of wind-heat, leading to sores. A remedy to clear the heart and promote flow should be used first, followed by an internal remedy to promote flow. This condition manifests before the gathering is complete; it starts from behind the joints, resembling grains of rice, gradually turning red and swollen, with a pervasive sensation of heat throughout the body.</p>
<p><strong>Sideburn Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This abscess affects the spleen, stomach, heart, and lungs, caused by the accumulation of heat. Remedies to dispel toxins and promote flow, along with those to clear the liver and promote flow, should be administered. If treatment is delayed, survival becomes difficult. Be cautious!<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong> (Song, Cui Zixu)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse for Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headache with a floating yang pulse indicates wind-cold; if the pulse is tight, it suggests wind-heat with a rapid count, and dampness is thin yet firm. A deficiency in qi will lead to headache, and even with a string-like pulse, it will be unclear; if phlegm obstructs, the pulse will be slippery, while kidney stagnation feels firm. Wind, cold, heat, and dampness may cause qi to stagnate, resulting in saliva; if there is deficiency below and fullness above, the patient may experience dizziness. A floating, tight pulse with cold suggests damp heat, and with a stringy, slippery pulse, there is no deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Methods</strong> (Song, Xu Shuwei)</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>A reverse sensation in the brain causes headaches, as does pain in the teeth, indicative of inverted headache due to disturbance. Pathogenic qi rises against the yang channels, causing pain, and if severe, leads to reversal symptoms. For headache accompanied by tooth pain, White Aconite Powder is recommended. If the headache is of kidney origin and manifests at the vertex with intolerable pain, Jade True Pill should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Book for the Living</strong> (Song, Zhu Gong)</p>
<p><strong>Headaches Associated with External Cold Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Headaches are generally yang manifestations. With a taiyang pattern, headaches are accompanied by fever, chills, and (if there is no sweating) Ma Huang Decoction; if sweating occurs, use Gui Zhi Decoction. If sweating has occurred and the headache feels like it&#39;s splitting, use Scallion White Decoction; if it persists, apply Kudzu and Scallion White Decoction. For a yangming pattern headache, if cold is not feared but heat is, this suggests stomach fullness, and Chéng Qì Decoction should be used. For a shaoyang headache, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate. In the case of taiyin and shaoyin with absence of headache, only the jueyin pattern is noted, treated with Wu Zhu Yu Decoction.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>On Head Disorders</strong>  </p>
<p>Hair issues related to the throat, tongue, head, neck, shoulders, back, chest, abdomen, and large joints of the limbs, especially in women with excessive breast tenderness, are considered severe; other areas are less critical. All five types of hair can cause headaches, nausea, chills, fever, shortness of breath, and cramps, which should be treated with Five Spice Powder or Five Spice Soup.  </p>
<p><strong>Brain Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>When energy rises to the head and leads to brain wind, there is a tendency for the neck and back to feel cold, and the brain to feel extremely cold. This condition is treated with Shen Sheng Powder.  </p>
<p><strong>Thunder Head Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>For treating thunder head wind, if various medicines are ineffective, it may be due to a mismatch with the condition. Thunder heads correspond to the thunder hexagram, hence I include lotus leaves in my prescription to symbolize the shape of thunder, and their blue color reflects this association. One should prepare and brew the formula based on &quot;Jufang&quot; using Sheng Ma Soup.  </p>
<p><strong>Head Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>Regarding head wind pains, it is stated that if saliva is not expelled, prolonged cases may lead to blindness and become untreatable. Use Melon Seed Powder to induce vomiting; after three expulsions, the condition will improve. If head wind results in eye problems, and there is partial vision recovery, use Fang Feng Powder to induce vomiting. Wind occurring after a fresh haircut is referred to as head wind, characterized by excessive sweating on the face and intolerance to wind. It is best addressed promptly; if severe on one day, it will improve little by the day of wind. Da Chuan Qiong Pills are effective for this.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p>
<h3>Kidney Deficiency Invoked by Cold Headaches</h3>
<p>When kidney deficiency is affected by great cold, it leads to headaches and also tooth pain. If the pain is severe and persists, it is treated with Tian Nan Xing Pills.</p>
<h3>Head Dizziness</h3>
<p>Dizziness caused by various winds is associated with the liver&#39;s wood element. If the wind qi is excessive, making the head and eyes dizzy, it indicates that the vigorous wood element is overwhelming the diminishing metal element, which would normally control wood. Wood then generates fire, and both wind and fire belong to the yang principle, often resulting in coalescing effects. Yang primarily governs movement, and when two movements collide, it causes rotation. </p>
<p>As the spring equinox approaches the minor fullness period, there are two essential energies indicative of the fire element. From the great cold to the spring equinox, there are seventy-three days representing the initial wind wood energy. Therefore, after the spring equinox, the clash of wind and fire often brings about swirls of wind, commonly referred to as whirlwinds. This phenomenon occurs throughout the seasons, influenced by the five movements and six energies, constantly varying and interacting in infinite ways. It is incorrect to simply state there are no effects outside of particular times, as it merely varies in intensity. </p>
<p>If a person experiences dizziness while riding in a cart, on a horse, or on a boat due to erratic movements and curving left and right, it is said that these movements embody the influence of wind. Dizziness accompanied by vomiting occurs due to excessive wind heat.</p>
<h3>Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety 【Yuan – Zhang Congzheng】</h3>
<h3>Headache and Vomiting Treatment<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></h3>
<p>Zhongjing said: In spring, the method of inducing vomiting is suitable. This is because during spring, yang energy is prominent, and both human energy and pathogenic energy rise, hence the need to induce vomiting. The medicines for this purpose can be in the form of pills or powders; when the illness is serious, one should stop without needing to take the full dose, as too much can harm a person. However, for urgent cases requiring vomiting throughout the four seasons, one does not need to wait for spring. For instance, in Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; there is the scallion root and fermented soybeans soup for vomiting in cases of headaches. In the &quot;Comprehensive Formulas,&quot; there is the Turmeric Powder for inducing vomiting in cases of headaches and vertigo. I often use vomiting formulas, all derived from Zhongjing, like the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting for headache due to cold damage, and the scallion and fermented soybeans soup for vomiting in various cases of headache. The method of inducing upward movement is termed as &#39;stirring phlegm&#39;, where the term &#39;stir&#39; implies controlling the movement, whether it contracts or expands. One case involved inducing vomiting for a man; a woman could not stop vomiting for half a month, with saliva accumulating to several buckets, her life hanging by a thread, frantic and at a loss, she sought my help. I prescribed a musk soup, which she swallowed, and it immediately stopped. It is said that when a gourd seedling smells musk, it dies; hence, inducing vomiting functions like gourd seeds. For those who cannot stop vomiting using cocklebur, I utilize scallion white soup to relieve. For those using stone medicine who cannot stop, I use licorice and Guanzhong to relieve. Various herbs and plants can be resolved with musk. My method of stirring phlegm involves probing with chicken feathers; if it does not come out, I throw in a mixture; if that does not induce vomiting, I will keep probing and throwing until it all comes out. If vomiting leads to dizziness, be cautious and do not panic. If there is dizziness when the headache starts, drinking cold water can quickly relieve; if there is no ice, fresh spring water will also do. The strong may manage to vomit once and be at ease; the weak may need to vomit three times to avoid any harm.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p>
<h3>Head</h3>
<p>Headaches that persist are the result of illness affecting the three Yang channels. The three Yang channels correspond to different parts of the body. When there is pain in the head and neck, it relates to the foot Taiyang bladder channel. Pain in the area of the eyebrows, commonly referred to as &quot;eyebrow pain,&quot; is related to this. Pain at the temples, commonly termed as &quot;migraine,&quot; is associated with the Shaoyang channel. If the pain continues for a long time, it may lead to loss of vision, due to illness in the three Yang channels being caused by phlegm retained in the chest. First, use tea to induce vomiting to expel the phlegm, then administer Xiangru powder or Baihu decoction, which will alleviate the condition. However, if headaches persist, a concoction of scallion whites and fermented soybeans can be used to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one can take Chuanxiong and peppermint to cool and clear the upper body, as well as concoctions like Soufeng pill or Xiangqiang powder. Zhang Zhongjing states that scallion roots and fermented soybeans can also induce vomiting for headaches due to cold damage. Shuhe mentions that a rapid pulse at the wrist indicates headache. Furthermore, for headaches that do not resolve, one may boil a soup of scallion whites and fermented soybeans and take it repeatedly, after which vomiting may be induced for efficacy. Following this, one can take Chuanxiong and peppermint soup, which are cooling remedies, as well as Soufeng pills or powders. Zhang Zhongjing notes that headaches from cold damage correlate with a rapid pulse at the wrist. Years of suffering from red eyes without resolution indicates the influence of head wind causing headaches, for which Dusheng powder or Bazheng powder may be used. With the heat stagnating in the three Yang channels, headaches may make one averse to sunlight; applying ice to the crown and inducing sweating and vomiting is advisable.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness, with symptoms such as head wind, numbness in the limbs, and stomach pain, all result from the combined influence of wind, cold, and dampness leading to obstruction. For this condition, if drinking is stagnant, one can use Duxing San to induce vomiting. After vomiting, take cooling and mildly spicy medicine. In cases of longstanding dizziness accompanied by phlegm stagnation in the chest, a strong presence of qi and blood can be effectively treated with vomiting. </p>
<p>For women experiencing dizziness when getting into vehicles or boats, accompanied by dry eyes, numb hands, hair loss, forgetfulness, and fluctuations in mood, this is often caused by phlegm accumulation in the chest; Duxing San can be used to induce vomiting here as well. After vomiting, one can take a decoction of Changshui Liushu combined with Wuling San, along with half a dose of Ren Shen and Ban Xia Wan, while regularly consuming wind-relieving cakes for recovery. </p>
<p>In cases of dizziness, Duxing San can be used to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one should take medicines that cool and lower internal heat, such as Fang Feng Tong Sheng San, adding Ban Xia and Nan Xing. </p>
<p><strong>Thunderhead</strong><a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The term &quot;thunderhead laziness&quot; is a mistaken name commonly used. This ailment stems from an accumulation of cold phlegm in the chest, often resulting from excessive washing of the hair. It can be treated by using tea to induce vomiting, thereby expelling two to three liters of cold phlegm; then, one should take three to five doses of Shenxiong pills; finally, taking Yufeng cakes will lead to recovery. &quot;Thunderhead&quot; refers to red, swollen nodules on the head, resembling slices of ginger or sour jujube. These can be pricked with a needle to draw out blood, which will permanently eliminate the root cause.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said that generally, those suffering from &quot;thunderhead laziness,&quot; a commonly misnamed ailment, experience headaches and dizziness due to hair washing, which is indeed a form of head wind. This is caused by the malevolent wind residing in the chest, which, when heated, transforms into phlegm—arising from the effects of wind. Tea can also be used to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one should take Zangyong pills followed by Wujing pills. If it’s a thunderhead condition, typically, there will be prominent red, swollen nodules on the upper body, or facial heat without sweating. The classics say this is because of stagnant fire. To relieve it, one can use a needle to draw blood, leading to recovery. The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states, &quot;When blood is depleted, there is no sweat; when sweat is depleted, there is no blood.&quot; Isn’t it remarkable when both blood and sweat are balanced? For the elderly, treatments can include cooling the diaphragm, detoxifying, and dispelling wind to clear heat. For the young, it is advisable to remove accumulated heat, using rhubarb and bindweed to promote the circulation of qi and blood, thus eliminating stagnation and achieving recovery.</p>
<p>In severe cases of head wind, prolonged suffering may lead to dizziness and unilateral headaches, which relate to the lesser yang fire; if prolonged, it may cause self-binding, with constipation in both small and large intestines. It is advisable to draw blood and use the Da Chengqi Decoction to induce a powerful laxative effect.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Headache Diagnosis and Treatment Principles</strong></p>
<p>Internal headaches come and go, while external headaches are often present; hence, one must focus on internal treatment. This distinguishes between internal and external conditions. The &quot;Golden Chamber True Words&quot; states: in spring, the east wind arises, which causes illnesses in the liver, particularly located in the head and neck, thus the spring warmth leads to headaches. Additionally, the Yang channels converge in the head and face; for instance, the pathway of the Foot Taiyang Bladder begins at the inner canthus of the eye, runs upward to the forehead and vertex, then enters the brain and exits downwards; disorders here cause headaches. The pathway of the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder starts at the outer canthus of the eye, reaches the temples, resulting in pain in the temples and forehead. Wind is received from above; when wind and cold invade from the outside and become lodged in the meridians, it can cause cold-induced headaches, a heavy sensation in the body, and aversion to cold. Treatment should focus on the Fengchi and Fengfu points, balancing yin and yang: if deficient, tonify it; if excessive, drain it. Sweating can lead to recovery, which characterizes cold-induced headaches. Persistent headaches accompanied by tinnitus and functional impairments in the nine orifices arise from gastrointestinal issues, indicating a headache due to qi deficiency.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>For those suffering from headaches and irritability, the illness is located in the diaphragm, related to excessive yang of the hand and lesser yin, indicating a damp-heat headache. If the qi does not descend but rises, and the headache feels severe at the top of the head, this indicates an upper full and lower empty condition, connected to excessive cold and damp of the foot&#39;s lesser yin and greater yang, potentially leading to kidney-related cold-damp headaches. For headaches that occur on one side, first address the lesser yang and yangming of the hand, then the lesser yang and yangming of the foot; this is categorized as a migraine. True headaches can be severe, resulting in intense pain in the brain, with cold hands and feet, leading to a fatal condition if untreated. Conversely, headaches due to reversed qi arise from extreme cold penetrating to the marrow, as the marrow is governed by the brain, causing the headache and tooth pain. All headaches are generally treated with wind-related medicines; fundamentally, the principle remains. At the highest point, only wind can reach, so those with a lighter flavor, representing the yang within the yin, rise from the earth to the heavens. However, distinctions between the three yin and three yang do exist. For taiyang headaches, there is aversion to wind, with a floating and tight pulse; primary herbs include Chuanxiong, Qianghuo, Duhuo, and Mahuang. For shaoyang headaches, the pulse is wiry and thin, alternating between cold and heat, with Chaihu as the main herb. For yangming headaches, presenting with spontaneous sweating, fever, and aversion to cold, the pulse is floating, slow, and full; primary herbs include Shengma, Gegen, Shigao, and Baizhi.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In cases of headache from the Taiyin, there must be phlegm, with a heavy body or abdominal pain, indicating phlegm accumulation. The pulse is deep and slow, with Cangzhu, Banxia, and Nanshen as primary treatments. For headache in the Shaoyin meridian, when the three Yin and three Yang meridians are not circulating and cold energy is rising, it is a case of cold blockage. The pulse is deep and thin, with Mahuang, Fuzhi, and Xixin as primary treatments. For headaches in the Jueyin, there may be vomiting of phlegm and cold, and the pulse is superficial and slow, with Wuzhuyu Decoction as the main remedy. For headaches due to blood deficiency, Danggui and Chuanxiong are the main treatments. For headaches due to qi deficiency, Renshen and Huangqi are the main remedies. For headaches due to both qi and blood deficiency, the Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction is effective, with slight additions of Chuanxiong, Manjiziz, and Xixin, showing remarkable results. Baizhu Banxia Tianma Decoction is used for treating phlegm blockage headaches. Qingkong Gao is a remedy for headaches caused by wind, dampness, and heat. Qianghuo Fuzhi Decoction is used for treating Jueyin headaches. If dampness is present in the head, one should expel it with bitterness; it should not be treated by fixed formulas. My esteemed teacher once suffered from headaches, with his cheeks turning bluish-yellow during attacks, dizziness, unwillingness to open his eyes, lethargy, and a heavy body, with a tendency to vomit. Jiego said: This is a combined illness of the Jueyin and Taiyin, called wind-phlegm. It was treated with the prescribed Yuhu Pill, and moxibustion was applied at the Xiaxi point, resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>To know the principle is the essence, and the method is its application. Merely holding on to the essence without understanding the application leads to error. If the essence and application are both preserved, one can be considered a master.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by the three yang channels, use Qianghuo, Fangfeng, Jingjiao, Shengma, Gegeng, Baizhi, Chaihu, Chuanxiong, Shaoyao, Xixin, and scallions with their roots, combined in two rotations. For headaches of a yin nature, simply using warming herbs is sufficient, akin to ginger in warming remedies.</p>
<p>When wind and cold injure the upper body, the pathogen enters from the outside and settles in the meridians, causing chills and headaches; or the wind-cold pathogen may remain in the yang channels, leading to unilateral headaches, for which the formulas Sanwuqi, Qiongxin Decoction, Qiongzhizhong Herbal Formula, and Shengbingzi should be used.</p>
<p>For headaches accompanied by irritability, the illness resides in the diaphragm, indicating damp-heat headache. It is advisable to use Qingkong ointment and Xiaoqingkong ointment, along with methods to induce vomiting.</p>
<p>Headaches due to qi reversal should arise from exposure to severe cold, penetrating deep to the bone marrow. Since the marrow is central to the brain, if the brain is reversed, it leads to both headache and toothache; this is termed a headache due to qi reversal. Use the Qianghuo Fuzhi Decoction.</p>
<p>Reversal refers to the upward movement of pathogenic qi causing pain in the yang channels, and in severe cases, can lead to syncope, which also causes headache and toothache. It is advisable to use the Baifuzhi Powder.</p>
<p>When there is deficiency of qi and blood, and the pathogenic qi reverses upward, it results in headaches.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Headache and tinnitus, with all nine orifices not functioning properly, and severe pain in the two temples, indicate a deficiency of qi leading to headache. One should use the Suanqi Hezhong Decoction or Huangqi Yiqi Decoction. </p>
<p>A blood deficiency headache arises when the pain attacks from the tail of the fish upward. The appropriate treatment is Danggui Bubai Decoction or modified Siwu Decoction. The term &quot;fish tail&quot; refers to just behind the eyebrows, near the hairline.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by both qi and blood deficiency, one should use the modified Tiaozhong Yiqi Decoction or Anshen Decoction.</p>
<p>After a major illness, if there is qi deficiency headache, use Sijuzan and add a pinch of tea to decoct and consume.</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding severe headaches, they may exist above the body, but heat pathogens lurk within, influenced by unseasonable weather and pestilential qi, leading to this illness. If there is suppuration and pus discharge, the risk of infecting others arises, which is why it is termed an epidemic disease. Generally, excessive yangming heat with insufficient shaoyang results in an intense fire from the heart, often located in shaoyang or yangming, and if severe, it may reverse to disturb taiyang. </p>
<p>The extent of swelling indicates where to target treatment based on the pathways involved. Damp heat causes swelling, while excessive wood provokes pain. When this affliction arises at the head, it often affects the front and back of the ears, with the initial visible symptoms becoming the primary and fundamental concerns. Early treatment is critical; however, medications should not be overly hastened to avoid exacerbating the condition. If upper heat has not been eliminated and blockages have occurred, it could be life-threatening. This ailment arises from the inside out, classifying it as a blood disease. Notably, since the head is affected by hidden evils in profound areas, treatment should initially be gentle before progressing to urgency.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The initial treatment should be gentle, as it is understood that the pathogenic qi resides above, manifesting in formless distinctions. Once it takes on formlessness, its transmission becomes indeterminate. If harsh remedies are applied forcefully, the pathogen will not be eliminated but instead aggravate the condition. Although gentle medicines are used, if administered abruptly—whether taken before meals or in a hurry—the essence of gentleness is lost, and the medicine cannot rise to dispel the formless pathogen. Additionally, if the properties, tastes, and forms of the medicinals mimic food, they must remain in harmony with gentleness; this includes cold medicines that are either fried or steeped in alcohol.</p>
<p>The subsequent urgent treatment refers to cases where the prior gentle remedies have already alleviated the pathogen by expelling it, allowing the qi to enter the interior, reaching the yin region, and affecting the internal, tangible quality. If the medicine does not act swiftly, it could damage the yin aspects; thus, urgent treatment is required in this context, specifically directed towards the pathogenic factor. Gentle treatment is appropriate for the fundamental condition, while urgent treatment is for the secondary pathogenic factor.</p>
<p>Yin pathogens reside below while yang pathogens are above, indicating their respective origins. The progression of illness does not adhere strictly to this sequence; misaligning gentleness with urgency not only fails to resolve the complications but may further disrupt the condition.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>This is the reason why the treatment for the host should be slow, while the treatment for the guest should be urgent. Those that receive yang evils and yin evils are regarded as the host; those that receive yin evils and yang evils are regarded as the guest. Generally speaking, what is considered urgent should be swiftly removed; this is the treatment for the guest with urgency. </p>
<p>For example, if there is illness in the Lesser Yang and the Yang Brightness, the Lesser Yang refers to the evil that emerges from the front and back of the ears, while the Yang Brightness refers to significant swelling of the head and face. First, prepare a decoction with Huangqin (Scutellaria), Huanglian (Coptis), and Gancao (Licorice) lightly roasted and finely ground, and have the patient consume it gradually. </p>
<p>If one dose is completed, then use Da Huang (Rhubarb) either soaked in wine or prepared by stewing. Additionally, take mouse glue and roast it on a new tile. Grind it finely, remove the residue, and combine with Meizhou (Mirabilite) in equal parts; this too should be consumed gradually. It should be taken after meals to gradually produce mild benefits. </p>
<p>If the evil qi has already manifested, only the previous medicine should be taken; if it has not improved, then the latter medicine can be administered. Follow the previous sequence in application, and once the desired benefit is achieved, stop. If there is thirst in the Yang Brightness, add Shigao (Gypsum); if there is thirst in the Lesser Yang, add the root of Kuluo (Trichosanthes fruit).<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>In the Yangming channels, add herbs like Asarum and Kudzu Root, Peony, and select accordingly. In the Taiyang channels, include herbs such as Qiang Huo, Jing Jie, and Fang Feng, and select accordingly. These should be used in combination with the main herbs; they should not be used alone. The dispersing herbs serve to dispel. This section also relates to the patient&#39;s symptoms and the proper management of Qi. Generally, when treating various ailments, one must first regulate Qi, then address the diseases, ensuring that the stomach Qi is not harmed; this is key. If the blood is affected, Qi must also be regulated first, for without regulation of Qi, blood cannot circulate. Qi serves as a guiding principle; if the husband does not sing, the wife does not follow. For women experiencing menstrual issues, one should first use Chai Hu to regulate the external symptoms, followed by Si Wu to clarify internal conditions, thus prioritizing Qi before blood. If one cannot drink and feels thirsty, or cannot eat but has yellow or turbid urine, this is due to weakened stomach Qi causing heat. If tangible substances cannot enter, fire rises, leading to thirst; thus one experiences yellow or reddish urine, akin to jujube juice. The remedy should be restorative, and using Qian Zhongyang&#39;s Baizhu powder, along with dry Kudzu, Saussurea, Agastache, and similar herbs, is indicated for treatment.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> (Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p>Migraines are characterized by pain on one side of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Various Treatments for Headaches</strong></p>
<p>Headaches are often related to phlegm; severe pain indicates excess fire. If it can be expelled, it can be purged. Qi stagnation in the channels also leads to headaches. Qingkong Gao treats all types of headaches, except for those due to blood deficiency. Blood deficiency headaches, originating from the tail of the fish upwards, are treated with Xiong Gui Decoction and ancient saliva-removing medicine. </p>
<p>Wind headaches associated with phlegm often involve heat, wind, and blood deficiency. For left-sided wind, use Jing Jie and Bo He; for blood deficiency, use Chuan Xiong and Dang Gui; for right-sided phlegm, use Cang Zhu and Ban Xia, with wine and Qin as the main treatment for heat. Additionally, for damp phlegm, use Chuan Xiong, Nan Xing, and Cang Zhu. </p>
<p>For left-sided migraines attributed to wind, use Jing Jie and Bo He, which are the main medicines for treatment. There is a hierarchy in the medicinal roles, where the main medicine (jun) should be predominant, followed by the minister (chen) and assistant (zuo) herbs, depending on accompanying symptoms. For phlegm, treat with Er Chen Tang and supplement as needed; the same applies to other presentations. </p>
<p>One must assess the condition holistically; adjustments should be made as needed without rigid adherence to a formula. Headaches generally correlate with phlegm; if severe pain is present, there tends to be excess fire, thus clearing phlegm and lowering fire is necessary, using Er Chen Tang, supplemented with Bai Zhi and Chuan Xiong as the main. </p>
<p>Individuals with a heavier build are often associated with damp phlegm, for which Ban Xia and Cang Bai Zhu are recommended.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Thin individuals suffer from heat and blood deficiency; they should take Siwu Decoction with added wine, Scutellaria, and Angelica. Those who are weak from labor may resemble having a cold, experiencing fever, sweating, and severe pain in both temples. This is due to the fire from below rising up; it&#39;s advisable to use the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Dan Gui; in severe cases, add Anemarrhena, Coptis, Vitex, and Asarum. For headaches that feel like they are splitting, take half a tael of rhubarb stir-fried in wine and decoct with tea. If the headache is accompanied by eye pain, this indicates wind-phlegm attacking upward; one should use Angelica Dahurica to open it. A unilateral headache indicates a condition of hemicrania.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>If the headache is in the front half, it is also a type of migraine.<br>For headaches, one should use Chuanxiong, and if there&#39;s no improvement, add guiding herbs. For Taiyang headaches, use Chuanxiong; for Yangming headaches, use Baizhi; for Shaoyang, use Chaihu; for Taiyin, use Cangzhu; for Shaoyin, use Xixin; and for Jueyin, use Wuzhuyu. If the headache is due to a cold, it is advisable to use Fangfeng, Qianghuo, Gaoben, and Baizhi. If the headache is due to qi deficiency, use Huangqi, Sheng Dihuang washed in wine, and Nxing, along with the Anshen Decoction. If the headache is caused by wind-heat, use Tianma, Manjingzi, Chuanxiong, and Huangqin prepared with wine. For bitter headaches, use Xixin.<br>If a thin and dark person has a headache, it indicates blood deficiency, and the remedy should include Danggui, Chuanxiong, and Jiuqing. If the pain is at the crown of the head, use Gaoben, Fangfeng, and Chaihu. Dongyuan states that for pain at the crown, Gaoben should be used, and Chuanxiong should be avoided. Many use hot medicines for headaches, but if heat is too intense, one should take Xiaofengsan or Chadian San. If the headache is triggered and there is tight pain at the nape and both sides, it might indicate coldness and deficiency, and a dosage of 357 San may be appropriate. The Suwen says that headaches stem from wind and cold that enter the brain marrow. The Benshifang states that among women suffering from headaches, half are affected, possibly because women do not cover their heads against wind and cold. There are also occasional cases among men. If the headache persists for years, one should moxibustion at the Yuhui, Baihui, Qianting, and Shangxing points.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p>
<h3>Headache Pulses</h3>
<p>For kidney-related headaches, the pulse is string-like when raised, and firm when pressed. A headache with a rapid pulse in the left hand indicates heat; a weak pulse suggests stagnant blood. A strong pulse in the right hand points to phlegm accumulation. A large pulse indicates a long-term illness.</p>
<h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Dizziness results from phlegm combined with qi deficiency and fire; the treatment focuses on resolving phlegm, supplemented with qi-replenishing and fire-reducing herbs. Without phlegm, dizziness does not occur; phlegm is stirred up by fire. There are also cases of damp phlegm and fire phlegm. For damp phlegm, Er Chen Tang is often suitable; for fire phlegm, add wine and Scutellaria. If there is a qi deficiency alongside, it corresponds to fire. Treat phlegm first, then combine qi-replenishing herbs to reduce fire. Formulas like Dong Yuan&#39;s Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Tang can be used. For severe dizziness, take Da Huang stir-fried with wine and grind into a powder, then mix with tea to take; alternatively, use Hei Xi Dan to settle the condition, addressing urgent symptoms. For phlegm stirred by fire, use Er Chen Tang with Huang Qin, Cang Zhu, and Qiang Huo to dispel wind and dampness. Dizziness means a dark rotation of vision, characterized by closed eyes, obscured sight, and a sense of unsteadiness like being on a boat. It can arise from extreme deficiency combined with cold; treatment must not take a single repetitive approach.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>When there is wind, there is sweating; when it is cold, there is pain; when it is hot, there is discomfort; when it is humid, there is heaviness. These four environmental factors can invade and cause dizziness. Additionally, when the seven emotions are repressed, phlegm can arise and provoke fire, leading to upward disturbances caused by these emotions. Excessive lust can prevent the kidneys from absorbing qi and returning to their origin, causing all qi to surge upward, leading to qi deficiency and dizziness. Vomiting, nosebleeds, and excessive bleeding can occur when the liver cannot properly regulate the nourishing qi, resulting in a chaotic flow of blood, which leads to blood deficiency and dizziness. </p>
<p>To discover the cause of illness, one must adapt to circumstances and respond accordingly, with the most important actions being the regulation of the rising and falling of qi. One should not hastily induce sweating or purging; an informed person will be cautious of potential misunderstandings. </p>
<p>For early morning dizziness that resolves quickly and becomes a regular occurrence, one should take Zhengyuan drink with Heixi Dan. For headaches caused by dampness, use a decoction with Chuanxiong, known as the Exclude Damp Decoction. To disperse wind, use Chuanxiong in a tea to make a powder.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Having phlegm, use the white pill of Qingzhou. </p>
<p>When experiencing dizziness or vertigo, this is often a sign of a gradual stroke. For the robust and fair-skinned individuals with weak qi and phlegm, use a double dose of the Four Gentlemen Decoction with honey-fried astragalus, adding pinellia and tangerine peel, or with a slight addition of chuanxiong and schizonepeta spikes to clear and benefit the head. For those who are thin and dark, use Er Chen Decoction with a slice of scutellaria and peppermint, combined with bamboo juice, ginger juice, and childhood urine for consumption.</p>
<p>If phlegm is abundant and accompanied by weak qi, add ginseng, white atractylodes, and astragalus to Er Chen Decoction, possibly with a slight addition of prepared aconite, and consume with bamboo juice and ginger juice. In cases of emaciation with blood deficiency and concurrent phlegm-fire dominance, combine Er Chen Decoction with Si Wu Decoction, adding a slice of scutellaria and peppermint, and consume with bamboo juice, ginger juice, and childhood urine.</p>
<p>If dizziness is accompanied by wind, then add drugs like fangfeng, schizonepeta, gastrodia, and gentian thus, for those with heat, add scutellaria, coptis, and gardenia; if cold is present, add dried ginger, cinnamon, and aconite. There should be no unrest. </p>
<p>When phlegm is above and fire is below, the fire will rise and move the phlegm. This condition is largely due to excess phlegm, as one cannot have dizziness without it. Even when caused by wind, there must also be phlegm. Furthermore, since fire can provoke phlegm, use Er Chen Decoction with scutellaria,苍术, and qinghao; if qi deficiency is also present, the treatment should primarily focus on phlegm while also including herbs that tonify qi and reduce phlegm.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p>
<h3>Head Dizziness and Pulse Method</h3>
<p>The pulse in the left hand is rapid and hot, and the pulse is thin with stagnant blood.<br>The pulse in the right hand is solid with phlegm accumulation, and the pulse is large due to a prolonged illness.<br>In those with a long illness, both qi and blood are depleted, resulting in a large pulse, and the turbid phlegm does not subside.</p>
<h3>Big Head Disease</h3>
<p>Big head disease arises from damp heat at the top. Use Qiang Huo and Huang Qin stir-fried in wine, and Da Huang steamed in wine, adjusting as necessary according to the illness. It is crucial not to take purgative medicine.</p>
<h3>Treasure of Health 【Yuan Dynasty, Luo Qianfu】</h3>

<p>Lesser Yang headaches feature a fine, wiry pulse with alternating cold and heat: use Chai Hu.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Yangming headaches, with spontaneous sweating, fever, and aversion to cold: use Bai Zhi.<br>Headaches from deficiency of qi and blood: use Huang Qi.<br>Taiyin headaches usually have phlegm, with heaviness or abdominal pain indicating phlegm accumulation: use Ban Xia.<br>Jueyin headaches present with neck pain, with a pulse that is floating, slightly slow, indicating an entry into the Taiyang disease, and there must be phlegm.<br>Shaoyin headaches, where the three yang meridians in the hands are not circulating and the feet are cold, indicate cold blockage.<br>Taiyang headaches, with aversion to wind and cold, alongside headaches from blood deficiency: use Chuan Xiong.  </p>
<p><strong>Head Wind</strong><br>Head wind pertains to the liver meridian, where strong wind causes the wood element to move on its own, thus wood overcomes earth, while metal comes to overcome it, indicating a reciprocal conflict between child and mother. When combing the hair results in snow-like flakes, this is a sign of lung issues, as the lungs govern the skin and hair. For constipation, use the blue pill; for weakness, use Ren Shen Xiao Feng San.  </p>
<p><strong>Head Swelling</strong><br>A large head indicates that excess heat invades the heart and lungs, attacking from above, causing swelling. It is commonly said: a large head signifies a celestial illness. Symptoms include swelling of the head and face, inability to open the eyes, shortness of breath, and dryness of the throat and tongue. Treat with the &quot;Experimental Efficacy Prescription,&quot; where Ren Shen and Qiang Huo San are added with Ge Gen, Scallion whites, ginger, and Zi Su to induce sweating. For spontaneous sweating and body pain, use Jiu Wei Qiang Huo, Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin, or add Fang Feng, Bo He, Chuan Xiong, and Dang Gui, chewing well or addressing hard stools. Also, add one or two qian of wine-steamed Da Huang to facilitate bowel movement. If the swelling is severe, acupuncture is recommended.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p>
<h3>Efficacious Methods for Headache</h3>
<h4>Headache</h4>
<p>For phlegm-wind headache, it is advisable to use Qingbai Fuzhi Pills, Dingfeng Cakes, or Xiongxin Daotan Decoction. True headaches penetrate from the top into the Fengfu and sink into the Niwan Palace, and cannot be cured by medicine. If the onset is in the morning, death may occur by evening; if in the evening, death may occur by morning. This is because the head is the root of humanity, and when the root energy has first dissipated, recovery is impossible.</p>
<h4>Pulse Diagnosis</h4>
<p>In cases of headache, the pulse is floating and slippery, easily alleviated, but if it is short and weak, it does not heal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Ancient and Modern Medical Canons</h3>
<h4>Headache</h4>
<p>For dampness-related illnesses, symptoms include body aches and fever, a pale face, wheezing, headache, and nasal congestion, with a large pulse. If one can still eat and has a harmonious abdomen, it indicates cold and dampness in the head, hence nasal congestion, and internal medicines will resolve the blockage. If there is fatigue and exhaustion, the vital energy weakens, causing the spleen energy to sink, resulting in headache and fever. There may also be alternating chills and fever, or a steaming, restless heat felt in the muscles. Initially, one may feel heightened energy and wheezing, with body heat and irritation, and the pulse being broad. This can lead to incessant thirst and numbness of the skin; wind and cold can cause alternating chills and fever, resembling typhoid fever. This is illustrated by Li Ming’s principle in the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; regarding labor exhaustion and insufficient energy, as well as the &quot;Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach.&quot; This is due to heat arising from within to the outside. </p>
<p>The Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction treats internal injuries from labor, with vital energy sinking and producing fever, addressing all symptoms of internal deficiency.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>For headaches, combine three parts of flowering vine, and if the pain is severe, add five parts of ligusticum. For vertex and brain pain, add five parts of dry rehmannia and three parts of asarum. These four ingredients are sufficient for treating all headaches. If the headache is accompanied by phlegm, with a heavy and sluggish feeling, it is due to phlegm and cold in the spleen. Add five parts of pinellia and three parts of ginger.</p>
<p>When the sun is afflicted, the evil resides in the skin, resulting in strong pain in the head and neck, and stiffness in the lower back. Generally, diseases of pestilence more frequently arise in the three yang channels as opposed to the three yin channels. A floating pulse with headache and fever indicates an affliction of the sun, which is treated with ginseng and qinghao powder, along with kudzu, scallions, ginger, and perilla for sweating. If there is spontaneous sweating and body pain, use the nine-ingredient qinghao decoction. The major head plague is due to evil qi from heaven, affecting the channels of the sun, yangming, and shaoyang, causing swelling of the head and eyes to become ill. The disease of the sun manifests in the head, particularly in the back of the brain and neck, and redness and swelling in the back of the neck and head. Treatment should employ the wind-dispelling and detoxifying powder, with qinghao and dry rehmannia moving through the channels. If all three yang channels are afflicted and there is involvement in the head, face, ears, and nose, then use the universal detoxifying drink, or the tongsheng powder or detoxifying powder. Externally, apply the cool-saving powder for relief.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Headache: Causes from Within and Without</p>
<p>Headaches that arise from within are caused by disorders of qi, blood, phlegm, and fluids, as well as stagnation of the internal organs, as discussed in Dongyuan&#39;s theories regarding headaches from qi deficiency, blood deficiency, and phlegm obstruction. Those that arise from outside are due to external pathogens such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness, exemplified by Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s discussions on cold damage and Dongyuan&#39;s six meridian classifications. </p>
<p>Wind, cold, heat, and dampness are all external pathogens, while disorders of qi, blood, phlegm, and bodily fluids are internal. Treatments should be tailored according to the condition of qi, blood, phlegm, and internal heat from emotions and differentiate between deficiency and excess, cold and heat, adjusting internal treatments and addressing external causes. For qi and blood deficiencies, it is advisable to use Dongyuan&#39;s methods. However, in cases such as those in the &quot;Three Causes&quot; text, where aconite is used to treat qi deficiency, this approach is based on the notion of yang deficiency, rather than a balanced state of blood and qi. For long-term cases of persistent headaches where there is often a combination of phlegm and phlegmy obstruction along with wind and heat stagnation in the meridians, blood deficiency may also be present, necessitating careful differentiation in treatment.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Methods for Treating Headaches with Herb Formulas</strong></p>

The classics say: “If dampness is above, expel it with bitterness.” Therefore, if the pathogen is within the chest, take medicine and vomit it out; if the pathogen is on the head, expel it through the nose. Zhang Zi’s tears from the eyes and nose flowing are both in line with the principle of expulsion.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Dizziness due to deficient conditions should be carefully examined in three aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p>For obese individuals, dizziness arises from Qi deficiency with phlegm; for thin individuals, it comes from blood deficiency accompanied by heat. After fever and sweating, it must be due to Yang deficiency. Therefore, the &quot;Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states: if there is deficiency above, then dizziness occurs. These three aspects can be attributed to deficiency.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Dizziness and Movement Should Be Carefully Examined by the Four Factors</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness involves wind, leading to sweating; cold results in pulling pain; heat causes oppressive discomfort; humidity brings heaviness and stagnation. These four factors can invade and cause dizziness. Emotional disturbances can generate phlegm and stir up fire, resulting in a surge of qi. The emotional disturbances lead to deficiency and dizziness. Excessive indulgence harms the kidneys, preventing the reception of qi and the return to the origin, causing the qi to rise against its natural course—this is qi deficiency and dizziness. Coughing blood or excessive uterine bleeding indicates that the liver can no longer contain the laboring force, leading to disordered blood—this is blood deficiency and dizziness. It is essential to identify the cause of the illness and adapt accordingly, prioritizing stabilizing the downward movement, and avoiding rashly inducing sweating or purging. </p>
<p>The &quot;Subtle Meaning of the Jade Mechanism&quot; states that dizziness is primarily caused by excess above and deficiency below, but does not clarify the underlying reasons. What is termed deficiency refers to a deficiency of qi and blood; what is referred to as excess includes phlegm, saliva, wind, and fire. For causes of illness, those with qi deficiency cannot elevate the clear qi, or excessive sweating may deplete yang, necessitating the raising of yang and supplementation of qi. In those with blood deficiency, due to excessive loss of blood, yang has no support, thus requiring the nourishment of yin and replenishing of blood; these are signs of insufficiency. If caused by obstructive phlegm, one should resolve phlegm and guide the stagnation; if due to wind-fire disturbance, one should clear the upper and lower the fire; if due to external attack, even if classified by the four factors, all require dispersing the pathogen, indicating conditions of excess.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>On the Treatment of Dizziness with Calming and Sinking Methods, Differentiating Between Symptoms and Root Causes</strong></p>
<p>The world speaks of the qi not returning to its origin, and employs elixirs for calming and sinking, such as using agarwood to lower the qi. Fragrant but drying substances disperse qi; can the qi that does not return thus be restored? When using calming methods, one addresses the symptoms when urgent. However, to suggest that one can make the qi return to its origin is not reasonable. If it is indeed returning to its origin, would one wish for it to arise again? Those who experience dizziness that briefly subsides and then returns have qi that has not returned to its origin and whose root cause has not been treated. To ensure the qi returns to its origin, one must seek to treat the root gently and thoroughly. </p>
<p>The classic states: all diseases arise from the movements and changes caused by wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire. Qibo lists nineteen pathological mechanisms, five of which pertain to fire. Is this not indicative of the pathogenic fire arising from the organs? In the &quot;Internal Canon,&quot; Lesser Yang disease manifests as fever and rheum, Greater Yang disease sees dizziness and sudden falls, and Lesser Yin disease presents with confusion, sudden loss of voice, and fainting, all of which pertain to heat-related dizziness and rheum, showing fireshadowing in the symptoms. Lesser Yin vomiting and qi counterflow; bladder conditions causing headaches; Greater Yang disease with qi rushing upward to the chest and lower abdomen, pulling the testicles and affecting the waist and spine, ascending to the heart; Lesser Yin disease causing qi to rush upward resulting in vomiting; are these not all related to the fiery counterflow upward? </p>
<p>For symptoms of dizziness with darkening vision, as if one is on a swaying boat and feels nauseous, this is phlegm. Those who suffer from frequent thirst and excessive drinking will surely feel dizzy, and if they have coldness in the back and nausea, this is due to a deficiency of the body.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Heavy Head</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Jade Machine&quot; states that a person is born with the essence of central harmony manifested in three forms: original essence, original qi, and original spirit. These three are the true essence, true qi, and true meridians inherent within oneself. Essence refers to the true origins of the organs and is not to be compared to the nutrients and blood, thus it is called heavenly essence. Human essence and blood are often insufficient; combined with various losses of the true essence, this results in a depletion of nutritive qi. When this qi is deficient, the protective qi cannot stabilize, leading to the essence slipping away, the kidney qi being exhausted, and the yin failing to rise with the stomach qi to connect with the clear yang qi. Consequently, many ailments present as a heavy head, or weakness in qi, causing reduced appetite, with original qi sinking and the pulse becoming faint, scattering externally to the point of near collapse or showing a diminished pulse. This is indeed caused by insufficient original essence rather than an invasion of external pathogenic factors.</p>
<p>The classic states: due to dampness, the head feels wrapped, and the voice resembles that of someone speaking from within a room. If damp heat persists, it steams upwards, resulting in a heavy head, yellowing of the eyes, and nasal congestion. Thus, Dongyuan notes: when dampness overwhelms, it aids wind to balance it, which leads to an assault of dampness from above.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Big Head Plague</strong></p>
<p>To treat the Big Head Plague, one should not attack swiftly, as the evil qi will not subside, and it may counterattack from within and harm the person. Furthermore, when the head experiences emptiness, if this emptiness takes hold, it can extend to all areas. Therefore, the treatment method should first be gentle and then become urgent, allowing the evil to lie low. The treatment involves clearing heat and disinfecting; for those who are deficient, it should also help to strengthen vital energy. For those with a weak stomach who eat little, it should additionally assist the stomach&#39;s energy; for those with inner fullness and excessive heat, who experience constipation, it is appropriate to use wine-soaked rhubarb to purge, thus enabling heat to release its toxicity. This is the method of first being gentle and then urgent. If swelling begins at the nose, then progresses to the eyes, followed by swelling at the ears, and finally reaches the head where it knots at the back of the brain, this will halt. If it does not disperse, it must produce pus before healing can occur.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When there is swelling and pain without pus, it&#39;s advisable to eliminate dampness and disinfect with formulas like Huang Lian Xiao Du Yin. In cases of severe pain, whether painful or numb, and especially if the toxin is profound, apply garlic moxibustion, along with detoxifying medicine. If there is swelling, pain, and constipation, it indicates internal blockage, and purging is necessary. </p>
<p>If the pain is not severe or there is no pus formation, it indicates a weakness, and the focus should be on supporting the digestive system. If there is no pus or rupture, it is advisable to support the digestive system. When pus has formed and there is pain, needling should be done along with supporting the digestive system. </p>
<p>If there is a large amount of pus and it does not subside, one must greatly nourish Qi and blood. If there is agitation with cold drinks, a strong pulse with pain, it is best to clear heat.</p>
<p><strong>Red and Swollen Head and Face</strong></p>
<p>The classics state: if swelling is above half the body, it is due to celestial energy; if below half the body, it is earth energy. The pathogen invades between the heart and lungs, ascending to attack the head and face, which is a result of improper seasonal attacks, different from conditions of excess heat from rich food. Laxatives containing salt and sulfur must not be used if there is constipation. If the cause is not clearly identified, and the difference between deficiency and excess is not discerned, then using aggressive treatments indiscriminately will lead to mistakes. </p>
<p>It is commonly seen that during times of famine, those who are hungry often suffer from this, indicating damage to stomach Qi, allowing pathogens to invade—this must not be overlooked. Common treatments for exterior pathogens include Ge Gen Niu Bang Zi Tang, Ren Shen Bai Du San, or Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin; if the pathogen is internal, formulas like Wu Li Da Huang Tang or Zhi Zi Ren Tang are used; if neither exterior nor interior issues resolve, Fang Feng Tong Sheng San should be considered; if both exterior and interior are resolved but swelling persists, use Xi Jiao Sheng Ma Tang.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>If there is severe swelling, use a lancet to extract the foul blood from the affected area to relieve the poison, and it will heal within ten days. If one expels pus and blood, they will recover; for promoting pus formation, use the Tori Disinfection Powder; for astringency, use the Tori Powder, as this method is the most reliable. If the throat is blocked for five to seven days, speech is absent, the head and face are not swollen, and food lacks flavor, it is not treatable. The present poison is the influence of the four malignancies on a person. Its symptoms manifest in the nose, face, ears, neck, and throat, with redness, swelling without a head, or a lump with a root, causing aversion to cold, fever, headache, body aches, confusion, and throat blockage. If a person does not recognize these, it may be typhoid; they should take an antidote immediately, and if swelling increases after one or two days, they will realize and begin to seek a sore doctor. This ailment has no ancient prescription; it is commonly referred to as danlu (red tumor) in popular folklore, and the afflicted often speak cruelly of the present poison, fearing contagion. The classics state that when a person suddenly develops red skin, resembling a dye, it is called dan poison.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>This wind-heat pestilence is malicious and different from seasonal poisons. At first, it resembles typhoid, and it can be fatal in five to seven days, so practitioners must be discerning. First, examine the pulse: slippery, rapid, floating, surging, sinking, tight, cord-like, and uneven are all its signs. The floating and rapid pulse indicates evil in the surface, while the sinking and uneven pulse suggests deep sickness. For those with strong vital energy, they should urgently take detoxifying elixirs to combat it; treating heat is problematic, so a dose of Da Huang Decoction is needed. For symptoms on the surface, the antidote Shen Ma Decoction should be administered to release it. For older individuals with weakened vitality, use the Wu Xiang Lian Qiao Decoction. Additionally, using nasal inhalation (or oral inhalation) to disperse air and inducing sneezing should be done until ten sneezes are achieved. If the medicine does not induce sneezing, treatment is not possible. If pus is expelled in the sneezing, the treatment will surely be effective. People around the patient should use sneezing medicine daily to prevent contagion. The patient themselves should also use the sneezing medicine three to five times daily to release the heat and toxins; this is a good method for treating this seasonal poison.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>If after three or four days there is no resolution, do not aggressively purge, but rather focus on harmonization, using remedies such as Rhinoceros Horn and Forsythia Powder. If after seven or eight days there is a beneficial passage of stool, but the head and face are swollen and red, one may take Tori San or Astragalus Powder, and it is advisable to use needles to draw blood to release the toxic gas. If after ten days there is no treatment, it may heal on its own. </p>
<p>In cases where symptoms manifest before five days, with confusion, a sensation of obstruction in the throat, inability to speak, no swelling of the head and face, and food lacking taste, it is likely fatal. It is crucial to understand that diseases have both yin and yang aspects, and may require sweating or purging, with varying degrees of severity and response. One must be discerning: if the interior is solid but not responsive, administer a purgative; if the exterior is solid but not dispersing, employ a resolving remedy. </p>
<p>If both the exterior and interior are solid and unyielding, harmonize the exterior and attack the interior; if both are resolved but not eliminated, harmonize them. For severe swelling and pain, use acupuncture to expel stagnant blood and then apply detoxifying agents. If there is no pus or no lesion present, use Tori. In an epidemic year, patients should not be treated too harshly and should be assessed with care.</p>
<p>For abscesses, there are those that cannot be treated. The points on the head where yang converges are located one inch and three-tenths of an inch behind the right jaw; a severe poison here cannot be treated. If the temples are more than an inch deep, it is also untreatable.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Medical Transmission</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Yu Tuan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All winds that cause dizziness are associated with the liver wood. It further states: When the wood of the year is excessive and the wind qi flows, the spleen earth becomes afflicted, causing the people to suffer from food stagnation and diarrhea, and in severe cases, sudden irritability and dizziness. Although this is caused by the transformation of qi, it is often due to the deficiency and decline of qi. Those with qi deficiency and a plump physique tend to have damp phlegm obstructing the upper regions, with yin fire rising from below. Thus, phlegm accompanied by deficient fire rushes up to the head, overwhelming genuine qi, leading to sudden darkness before the eyes and the sensation of spinning, akin to being in a moving boat or vehicle, and in extreme cases, there can be fainting with no awareness. What Danxi referred to as &quot;dizziness cannot occur without phlegm&quot; precisely refers to this. </p>
<p>Conversely, in lean and dark individuals, whose bodies are weak, true water is inadequate, or if they overexert themselves, the fiery yang may flare up, they can also experience dizziness from time to time, regardless of damp phlegm. Generally, for those who are plump and experience dizziness, the treatment should primarily focus on clearing phlegm and reducing fire, while also incorporating medicinals to replenish qi. For those who are lean and experience dizziness, the treatment should emphasize nourishing yin and reducing fire, along with herbs that suppress the liver. </p>
<p>Moreover, when examined in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it states: When the wind prevails, the ground shakes. In years where wood is excessively strong, there can also be external wind pathogens causing dizziness due to qi transformation. The treatment method should aim to expel wind and harmonize qi, pacifying the liver and reducing fire, which is a good strategy. Additionally, dizziness may occur due to external trauma; in such cases, there may be obstruction in the heart vessels due to stagnant blood. Therefore, blood circulation should be promoted to disperse the accumulated blockages. By applying appropriate treatments for various types, there is nothing that cannot be cured.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Migraine</p>
<p>For migraines on the right side, use Erchen Decoction, adding Chuanxiong, Baizhi, Fangfeng, Jingjie, Bohe, and Shengma. For migraines on the left side, combine Erchen Decoction with Siwu Decoction, adding Fangfeng, Jingjie, Bohe, Xixin, Manjingzi, Chaihu, and Jiuqin.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Febrile Disease: Headache and Mortality Indicators</strong></p>
<p>In febrile illness lasting two to three days, if there is body heat, abdominal fullness, headache, and normal appetite, with a rapid pulse, death occurs on the eighth day. In febrile illness lasting four to five days, accompanied by headache, abdominal fullness, and vomiting, with a fine and strong pulse, death occurs on the twelfth day.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming - Dai Sigong】</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headaches can arise from various causes, including Qi, phlegm, deficiency, external pathogenic factors, or as a result of food and drink indulgence or labor-related exhaustion. Regardless of the symptoms, during the suspicious period, one may use prescriptions such as Sheng Bingzi or Wu Qiong Tang. For headaches caused by foul and toxic factors, one may take a fried Xiang Fu remedy to heal. In &quot;Jing Gong’s&quot; explanation of pain, he describes it as something that should flow; blockage results in pain. </p>
<p>In cases of unilateral headaches due to wind, if taking Chuan Wu and Xiang Fu does not yield results, using Lian Zi with Cao Wu may lead to recovery. This approach involves using poison to counteract poison, which should not be overlooked. For headaches from heat in the upper body, a remedy such as Bai Du San with Chai Hu and adding Gan Ju Hua is appropriate. </p>
<p>If there is a history of headaches with dizziness, one should not claim the absence of pain to disregard the possibility of wind; careful examination is essential, and one should not hastily resort to treatments aimed at deficiency. If tonic treatments worsen the condition, and there are no issues such as blood loss or similar disorders, this is a case of wind dizziness requiring Xiao Xu Ming Tang and adding three to four whole scorpions.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>Headaches caused by external wind are painful, often extending to the brain, feeling like being pulled. When this occurs, one cannot open their eyes, and dizziness prevents lifting the head. It is advisable to use Xiongxin Decoction, adding five whole scorpions each time, with intervals of taking Taiyang Dan and Ru Sheng Bingzi, or using Da Cha to mix with powders like Ba Sheng San, Zhui Feng San, and Da San Wu Qi San. If there is heat in the upper diaphragm, use Da Cha to mix with powders, along with Yi Zi San. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by phlegm, especially in those who vomit excessive phlegm, Xiongxin Decoction is suitable, or Xiongxin Decoction without tea buds, and Phlegm-Draining Decoction with half a cash of Xiong, and Ba Sheng San is also applicable. If the condition occurs at any time, commonly known as phlegm-drinking headache, it is due to Qi stagnation and phlegm rising to attack, causing headaches. The best approach is to smooth Qi with Er Chen Tang or Phlegm-Draining Decoction, which can include modifications.</p>
<p>Headaches with heat and a painful lump in the neck can be treated with Du Liang Wan. For itchy and painful headaches due to rotten wind, use external medicines along with grinding black vinegar with iron rust for application, or ginger juice can also be rubbed on.</p>
<p>Anger injures the liver and disrupts lung Qi, which rises to the brain, causing headaches. It is appropriate to use Chen Xiang Jiang Qi Decoction and Suzi Jiang Qi Decoction, with the nourishing Zheng Dan or Xiongfu Drink. </p>
<p>When headaches result from deficiency, known as kidney-induced headaches, use Zheng Yuan San or Da San Wu Qi San, prepared with salt decoction. Alternatively, you can add fifteen pieces of roasted pepper to Zheng Yuan San and follow with Fu Dan and intersperse with He Xi Dan. If these medications are ineffective and the pain worsens, use Rong Zhu Dan, as deer antler grows on the head; thus, treating head ailments with deer antler is due to the principle of like curing like.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p>
<h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Phlegm and fluid retention, head wind, the seven emotions, loss of blood, intoxication, and other diseases can all cause dizziness. Each has been explained in its respective context; now I will specifically discuss dizziness not accompanied by other ailments, which is due to deficiency. However, there are cases of recurrent dizziness; some patients experience it upon waking, which soon resolves and becomes habitual. For treatment, one can take Zhengyuan Decoction with Heixi Dan.</p>
<p>There are instances where dizziness is caused by deficiency, where during periods of dizziness, the patient tends to seek warmth by wanting to be near fire to warm their hands. This is because the head and face are the convergence of the Yang energies, which are insufficient. </p>
<p>There are also cases of head wind characterized by a constant ringing in the ears, coupled with sounds resembling chirping birds above the head. One must not hastily conclude that ear ringing is purely a deficiency; it is instead caused by wind affecting the head and brain. </p>
<p>In severe instances of dizziness, when tilting the head, the surroundings appear to spin, and one may constantly see black spots or feel as if objects are moving or doubling in vision. For treatment, small doses of Sanwuqisan, or Qiangfu Decoction can be used, or one may add a coin of deer antler to Zhengyuan Decoction, along with Ling Sha Dan, or use Zhengyuan Decoction simmered with fifteen grains of ChuanJiao, followed by Rongesan Wan. If these treatments are ineffective, one might try using only deer antler, taking half a tael at a time with three cups of unsalted wine, simmering it down to one cup, straining, and adding a small amount of musk to take. There was a case where persistent head pain that wouldn’t go away was effectively treated with Rangzhu Dan.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br><strong>Medical Overview by Lou Ying (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Head Heaviness and Pain</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is active and there is a feeling of heaviness and pain in the head, accompanied by a sensation of heat, this is related to the stomach. It is advisable to adjust the stomach by administering the Chengqi Decoction, which will lead to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Head Shaking</strong></p>
<p>If the head rotates with the wind and there are no other painful symptoms, and one is often unaware yet the head shakes on its own, this is the condition described. If the liver wind is strong, it causes the head to shake. The treatment is the same as for head wind.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p>
<h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Cheng Wujin says: Dizziness is not truly dizziness but rather to see one’s own dizziness, referred to as dark vision. &quot;Yun&quot; refers to the movement of rotation; in the world, this is known as &quot;head spinning.&quot;</p>
<h3>Headache Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>If the illness involves headache and eye pain, with a pulse that is rapid, short, and thin, it is fatal.</p>
<h3>Brain Abscesses and Sores</h3>
<p>When an abscess occurs in a specific area of the brain, it can result in brain abscesses, brain sores, or brain inflammation. These can manifest at the point above the large spine bone, entering the hairline and causing brain abscesses. The skin here is thin and easily punctured, so it should be punctured to release pus without harm. Brain sores, however, have thick skin, making it difficult to puncture. Internal toxins need to be expelled urgently before a puncture can be made.</p>
<p>When red sores appear on the left or right temples, regardless of size, they resemble peaches or plums. It is advisable to apply medication and puncture them to see pus without harm. A toxic sore or malignant sore located at the right temple corner, near the temple, can lead to swelling that drains energy and becomes difficult to manage. If it is punctured after experiencing external wind or water conditions, it may harm the individual; therefore, medication is also required to manage pus post-puncture and quickly close the wound. If this persists into the winter months, it may result in a cold sore. Areas near the temple and up to the forehead corner are considered hazardous.</p>
<p>On the left and right temples, if abscesses, sores, or boils develop that do not rupture for five to seven days, toxic energy can flow into the eye socket, causing the eyes to clamp shut. Apply medication to rupture it, and afterward, be cautious about external wind and water. If wind or water enters, it may damage the vision and cause significant eye disorders.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>For chronic headaches, they tend to arise with a slight exposure to wind and cold. In cold months, it is necessary to wrap the head in thick cotton cloth. This condition is one of accumulated heat, with the underlying heat presenting as a superficial cold. People often do not recognize this and typically use pungent and warming medicines to disperse it, experiencing temporary relief and mistakenly identifying it as a cold. They are unaware that due to the underlying heat, the pores are frequently open, allowing wind and cold to invade. The external cold constricts the internal heat, leading to pain. Although pungent and warming medications can open these blockages and dispel the superficial cold pathogens, they also aggravate the underlying heat, worsening the chill. </p>
<p>The primary treatment should be aimed at draining fire and cooling the blood, supplemented by mild pungent and warming agents to address the superficial symptoms. This method is effective for curing the illness and eliminating its root cause. </p>
<p>(Note: Most prior cases focus on phlegm; when the pain is severe, it may signify an attack from wind and toxins. Other causes may include blood deficiency, Qi stagnation in various channels, Qi deficiency, external damage from six excesses, injuries from overexertion, or conditions suitable for purging or vomiting; treatment should be tailored to address both deficiency and excess, along with adjustments for cold and heat. In cases of unilateral headaches that do not improve over time, there may be an internal mixture of phlegm and wind-fire obstructing the channels and stifling the flow of Qi and blood. Severe cases can lead to symptoms like visual disturbances and constipation, which would require blood-letting to relieve the obstruction and address the superficial symptoms. I once treated Liu Yizhai, who experienced pain in both temples when angered. I first used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Poria and Gardenia, followed by Liuwu Decoction to nourish kidney water, which successfully resolved the issue without recurrence.)<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> by Li Zhan</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>The brain is the sea of marrow, and all the marrows belong to the brain. Therefore, from the brain above to the tailbone below, it is the pathway for the rise and fall of essence and marrow. A heavy and painful head, entering the &quot;mud pill&quot; (the brain), with cold hands and feet and blue nails, is called true headache; if accompanied by severe tooth pain, it belongs to the Lesser Yin and Absolute Yin syndrome, and should not be treated. </p>
<p>Chronic migraines, with dry stools, red eyes, and dizziness, are due to the lung&#39;s upward attack on the stagnant liver qi and obstructed blood. It is advisable to use the Major Purging Decoction. For external application, grind rhubarb and mirabilite into a powder, mix with well water mud, and apply to both temples for recovery. </p>
<p>For migraines, remedies include Chuanxiong Tea Tonic, Yizhi Qingjin Powder, Chuanxiong Powder, and Xiongxi Pills. If damp phlegm causes tight and constant pain, use San Sheng Pills or Er Chen Decoction with Nanshing, Cangzhu, Chuanxiong, and Xixin. </p>
<p>If qi rises and does not descend, leading to pain, use Xiongwu Powder. For dampness caused by exposure to rain resulting in heavy-headache and dizziness, which worsens in wet weather, use Chuanxin Decoction or Xiongzhuzhi Xuan Tonic.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br><strong>Head Wind Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The syndrome of head wind often involves phlegm and fluid. It may occur from exposure to coolness during bathing or prolonged lying in the wind, causing the evil wind to enter the brain and neck. Above the neck, areas between the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and eyebrow ridge may experience numbness or lack of sensation. Symptoms may include heaviness in the head, a feeling of movement in the head, or a thick scalp with no awareness. There may be a loss of sensation in the mouth and tongue, making it difficult to taste food, deafness, eye pain, or aching above and below the eyebrow ridge. One may experience extreme scents or extreme foul odors in the nose, or merely yawn and have symptoms of dizziness. For heat symptoms, dispersing wind is effective; for cold symptoms, pursuing wind is helpful. Common formulas include Chuanxiong Chafiaoshan and Qu Feng Tongqi San. </p>
<p>When head wind is accompanied by pressure and pain, wrapping with a soft cloth is often necessary, indicative of heat stagnation. A modified Erchen Decoction with jujube honey, schisandra, chuanxiong, mint, gypsum, and asarum may also be effective. For head wind, Bai Zhi San, Tianxiang San, or modified Xiangxun Decoction, or chrysanthemum tea decoction are recommended. For women suffering from head wind, nourishing blood and dispelling wind soup is advisable.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p>
<h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Dizziness, also referred to as &quot;faintness,&quot; describes the feeling of darkness (dizziness), the act of rotation (spinning), and the sense of confusion (faintness). These all convey a similar meaning. Generally, if dizziness indicates disarray, excessive sweating, and diarrhea occurring intermittently, such conditions may indicate a severe deficiency that is difficult to treat.</p>
<h3>Heaviness of the Head</h3>
<p>In cases of typhoid, heaviness of the head that cannot be lifted presents two signs: if the yang disease is deep, one cannot lift the head; if the balance of yin and yang is disturbed, one also cannot lift the head; both indicate a critical condition.</p>
<h3>Head Shaking</h3>
<p>In typhoid, if the yang pulse is unbalanced, it causes the head to shake. Those with cardiac cessation may also shake their heads, and if wind is prevalent in convulsive diseases, it will cause head shaking; all of these are ominous signs. Additionally, if there is an internal illness accompanied by head shaking, it also signifies a severe condition.</p>
<h3>Flaking of the Scalp</h3>
<p>The presence of white flakes on the scalp indicates a lung condition. The lungs govern the skin and hair, hence when affected by wind-heat, the scalp becomes dry and itchy, resulting in white flakes. It is advisable to disperse the wind and resolve it.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Dizziness and Pulses</h3>
<p>If the liver pulse is excessive, it is likely to cause dizziness; precautions should be taken.</p>
<h3>Cerebral Abscess</h3>
<p>When there are signs of pain and swelling of the scalp with thirst and a preference for cold, it is recommended to use formulas such as Huanglian Disinfectant Powder, Danggui Qianghuo Decoction, or Clear Heat and Disinfectant Beverage. If there is swelling and pain accompanied by thirst with a liking for hot soup, this may indicate kidney deficiency with excessive yang fire; for this, formulas like Toli Disinfectant Powder, Toli Qi-Boosting Decoction, or Kidney Qi Pill are recommended.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>According to the classics, headaches may result from wind, cold, or deficiency. In discussions of headaches, there are ten types based on environmental factors. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; mentions one type of headache associated with the Taiyang (Greater Yang) stage. All these conditions arise from the invasion of the six external pathogenic influences and the depletion of vital energy, causing the qi to reverse and obstruct the clear pathways, which leads to stagnation and pain. </p>
<p>The head is the manifestation of heavenly phenomena; the clear yang qi from the six fu organs and the essence blood from the five zang organs converge here. Therefore, the six external evils of nature and the five internal changes of human qi can harm each other. This can either obscure the clarity or obstruct the meridians, leading to an accumulation of qi that transforms into heat, with a full pulse resulting in pain. </p>
<p>If the pathogenic qi lingers, it causes a full pulse and chaotic qi and blood, which intensifies the pain; this is true pain. If invaded by dampness and cold, with weakened true qi, although there may not be an accumulation leading to heat, the external factors can affect the pulse; externally, the blood flows cold and constricted, leading to localized pain that ceases with warmth; this is considered deficient pain.</p>
<p>Headaches caused by wind result in sudden, gripping pain. Those caused by heat lead to irritability and a sense of heat. Pain due to dampness results in a heavy head with worsening symptoms when it’s cloudy. Phlegm-induced pain results in a feeling of heaviness and a continual urge to vomit. Cold-induced pain leads to tightness and a shivering response to cold. Pain from qi deficiency is often worsened by exertion, presenting with a wide pulse. Pain from blood deficiency is characterized by heightened anxiety, with a thin pulse.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>Headaches have many causes, and ancient remedies often use wind-related treatments; why is that? At the heights, only the wind can reach, and those with a light flavor, arising from the yin within the yang, ascend from the earth to the sky. In cases of wind, cold, and dampness, these are indeed the proper applications, while those that are deficient or heated also rely on references from the classics. One must understand that new and sudden conditions are merely called headaches; deep and prolonged ones are termed &quot;head wind.&quot; Head wind must harm the eyes; as the classics say, the east wind arises in spring, affecting the liver. The eyes are the orifices of the liver. When liver wind moves, it harms the empty orifices. By examining internal and external causes and distinguishing between deficiency and repletion, if one&#39;s chest feels clear, the ailment will resolve instantly. </p>
<p>Wind-damp with heat leads to headaches that obstruct above, harming the eyes and causing brain pain, whether it be unilateral or bilateral. If it persists for years without cure, one should focus on clearing and uplifting the essence, using fine herbs for intense pain. </p>
<p>For phlegm obstruction headaches, where the taiyin pulse is weak, one should use the clearing essence, adding Ban Xia and Tian Ma to Qiang Huo and Fang Feng. </p>
<p>For headaches from yangming pathology, characterized by fever, aversion to heat, and thirst, Bai Hu Decoction should be used, with an increased dose of Bai Zhi. </p>
<p>For headaches associated with kidney obstruction, as referenced in the classics where there is lower deficiency and upper repletion, when the pulse rises, it feels string-like; when pressed it feels hard, thus use Yu Zhen Wan or Lai Fu Dan. </p>
<p>For food-stagnation headaches, characterized by fullness in the chest, sour taste in the throat, bad breath, aversion to food, even with fever yet without body pain, one should use Xiang Sha Zhi Zhu Wan. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by alcohol consumption, Ge Hua Jie Cheng Decoction should be administered.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>Anger injures the liver, causing headaches; use incense to reduce qi or Suzi Decoction to lower qi. For headaches with blocked orifices due to qi deficiency, use the Qi-Boosting Decoction combined with peony, Chuanxiong, and Xixin. The area just behind the eyebrows and near the hairline is called the &quot;fish tail.&quot; Headaches from this area belong to blood deficiency; use Four Substances Decoction with mint. If labor or physical activity induces headaches, it suggests stomach heat; take five qian of wine-fried Dahuang and brew with strong tea. For irritability and headaches, use Qingkong Ointment with Mai Men Dong and Danshen. If there&#39;s upper heat causing headaches, with red eyes and lower cold (in the feet), especially if there’s slight constipation, use the Jiji Detoxification Decoction. A unilateral headache is termed &quot;side wind&quot;; the left side signifies blood deficiency, while the right indicates qi heat; the Xiongxi Pill is very effective. True headaches can cause a bluish tint to the hands and feet up to the joints, with morning onset leading to evening death, and evening onset leading to morning death. The brain is the sea of marrow; when affected by evil, it may lead to death. Moxibustion at the Baihui point and taking high doses of ginseng and fish essence can sometimes save lives.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Thunder Head Wind</strong></p>
<p>Thunder head wind causes headaches with lumps, or the sensation of thunder in the head. The body shakes like thunder, resembling the shape and color of a green lotus leaf. The Qing Zhen Decoction is used for this condition. If caused by phlegm-fire, which has a thunder-like sound in the ears, use one tael of cooked Ban Xia, two taels of prepared Da Huang, six qian each of Tian Ma and Huang Qin, three qian of mint leaves, and three qian of licorice. Combine with water to form pills the size of a mung bean. Take two qian with tea before lying down, adjusting the dosage according to the phlegm condition.</p>
<p><strong>Great Head Wind</strong></p>
<p>Great headache manifests as an enlarged head. This is caused by the inauspicious qi of heaven and earth, leading to pus formation in severe cases. This evil affects the upper part of the body and is treated with the Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin. In mild cases, this is called &quot;facial swelling,&quot; found in front of and behind both ears. A combination of Gan Zhi Decoction with added mint, Jing Jie, Mu Zuan Zi, Lian Qiao, and Huang Qin is recommended.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p>
<h3>Headache Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The pulse at the cun position is tight and urgent, whether it is short, string-like, or floating, all indicate headache. A floating and slippery pulse suggests wind phlegm, which is easy to treat. A short and thin pulse indicates deficiency, which is difficult to treat. A floating and string-like pulse indicates wind, while a floating and flooding pulse indicates fire; a thin or slow pulse indicates dampness.<br>— <em>Ancient and Modern Medical Insights</em> (Ming - Gong Xin)</p>
<h3>Headache Diagnosis</h3>
<p>For headaches characterized by yang excess, the pulse is floating, with wind causing tension and cold; a wind-heat pulse is flooding and rapid, while a damp pulse is fine and firm. For qi deficiency headaches, even if the pulse is string-like, it must be thin. In phlegm and qi headaches, the pulse is firm in the region of the kidneys. Additionally, a pulse that is tight and urgent, whether short, floating, or string-like, indicates a primary headache condition.<br>— <em>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</em> (Ming - Xue Ji)</p>
<h3>Headache</h3>
<p>For chronic headaches, they may arise with slight exposure to wind and cold; in the case of cold months, thick cotton wraps should be used. This indicates a condition of accumulated heat with a base of heat but presenting cold symptoms. If warm, pungent medications are used to dispel the exterior, temporary relief might occur, misleading one into thinking it is merely cold. However, due to inherent accumulated heat and persistent openings, wind and cold easily invade. External cold restricts internal heat, leading to pain; though warm, pungent remedies can disperse the cold evil on the surface, they exacerbate the original heat condition, worsening the chill. Hence, the primary approach should be to drain fire and cool the blood, supporting this with warm, dispersing remedies for the exterior. This method can lead to resolution, eliminating the root of the issue. If recovery from a cold occurs, it is also advisable to regulate the righteous qi, nourishing it according to the underlying mechanism of the ailment to prevent recurrence.<br><a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>Head Dizziness</p>
<p>When experiencing dizziness, if the pulse at the right wrist is floating and weak, it indicates spleen and lung qi deficiency; use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If the left pulse at the guan (bar) and chi (cubit) is rapid and weak, it indicates liver and kidney qi deficiency; use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the right pulse at the cun (inch) and chi is either large and floating or very thin, it indicates yang qi deficiency; use the Ba Wei Di Huang Wan. For blood deficiency, use Si Wu Decoction with additional ginseng, poria, and astragalus. For qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Decoction with additional angelica and astragalus. For excess heat in the liver channel, use Chai Hu Qing Gan San. For deficient heat in the liver channel, use Liu Wei Di Huang Tang. For weak spleen qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. For spleen deficiency with phlegm, use Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Decoction. For excessive bleeding from external conditions, use Xiong Gui Decoction. For symptoms of fever and aversion to cold, use Sheng Yu Decoction. Generally, when there is fever, it indicates injury to the true qi, so one should not use bitter, cold medicines, for fear of further damaging the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain but no pus, it is advisable to eliminate dampness and disinfect. If the pain is severe, or if there is no pain or numbness, the toxicity is significant. Apply garlic and cauterize it, and additionally use detoxifying medicine. If there is swelling, pain, and constipation, the evil is internal, and it should be released. If the pain is not severe or there is no pus, it indicates deficiency, with a focus on supporting the middle. If pus has formed and there is swelling and pain, perform acupuncture on it, and continue to support the middle. If the pulse in the upper body is rapid, firm, and painful, it is advisable to lower the fire. If the upper pulse is rapid, weak, and painful, it is advisable to nourish the yin and lower the fire as the main treatment. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid and thirst is present, nourish yin and lower fire. If there is no pus or no abscess formation, support the middle medicine is the main treatment. If pus is clear or does not congeal or is abundant, greatly nourish qi and blood. If there is agitation and drinking cold water, and the pulse is firm and painful, it is advisable to drain fire. Brain abscess belongs to the bladder meridian, associated with accumulated heat, or damp toxin rising, or yin deficiency with fiery excess, or kidney water depletion leading to the exhaustion of yin essence.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>At first, the swelling is red and very painful, with a troubling thirst for cold drinks. The pulse is strong, rapid, and flooding, indicating a rise of damp-heat. One should use the Huanglian Xiaodu Decoction and apply garlic moxibustion to eliminate damp-heat. If the swelling is mild with slight pain, thirst is absent, and the pulse is strong, rapid, and weak, it indicates a deficiency of Yin and a flare of fire. One should use the Liuwei Dihuang Pill and the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If the mouth and tongue are dry, urination is frequent, or there is painful dripping, this indicates a deficiency of kidney water. One should urgently use the modified Bawei Pill and the anterior decoction to reinforce the foundation and redirect fire back into the channels. If there is no pus or necrosis, it indicates Yang deficiency, in which case the Si Junzi Decoction with Guizhi should be added. If flesh does not form and healing does not occur, this signifies a deficiency of Spleen Qi, indicating a need for the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. If the color is dark and there is no resolution, or if it ruptures but does not heal, this implies a depletion of Yin essence, termed &quot;Nao Shuo,&quot; and is considered untreatable. When attacking and tonifying are properly indicated, there is still a possibility of recovery, and the practitioner should observe closely.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br><strong>Nail Abscess Cauterization Method</strong></p>
<p>Li says: For brain abscesses and jaundice in the neck, do not use garlic isolation cauterization, as it may cause the poison to rise and attack. It is advisable to cauterize the Zusanli point five times, the Qihai point three times, and to also take medicines that cool the blood and detoxify, or to use the bamboo horseback method for cauterization. In cases where abscesses appear in the head, neck, or throat, traditional methods have generally been ineffective; however, using this method has led to many recoveries. Preparations such as Five-Spice Lianqiao, Luo-Gu Decoction, Guo Lao Ointment, and Wan Jin Powder can all be selected.</p>
<p>Note: When the condition pertains to the Bladder channel, damp-heat obstructs upward, or Yin fire inflames upward. If due to damp-heat, then the pathogenic qi is excessive while the original qi is insufficient; one should use Huanglian Disinfectant Powder to eliminate damp poison and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If due to Yin fire, then both the original and pathogenic qi are insufficient; in this case, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pill to nourish the kidney water. Should the kidney water dry up, leading to terminal symptoms, urgently apply the modified Eight-Flavored Pill along with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to strengthen the foundation and draw fire back to its source. If the abscess appears dark and does not rupture, or if it ruptures but does not heal, it is termed &#39;Nail Erosion&#39;, which is untreatable. Generally, if swelling and pain are severe, it is advisable to use a life-saving drink and garlic isolation cauterization to dissolve stagnant blood and draw out the repressed poison, although the moxa sticks should be small and few. If there is a desire for it to form pus and decay, leading to muscle regeneration and closure, then the main method should be to use Tori.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Bing Ju (Temple Sores)</strong></p>
<p>Bing Ju relates to the liver and gallbladder channels, caused by anger, heat, or blood deficiency. If there is fever and thirst, use Chai Hu Qing Gan San; for severe swelling and pain, use Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin. If the acute condition has subsided but residual toxins remain, use a base of Ren Shen, Qi, Gui, and Shu, supplemented with Chuan Xiong, Bai Zhi, and Jin Yin Hua to expedite the formation of pus. Once the pus has formed, continue with Ren Shen and Qi to assist in draining it. If you want to promote healing and contraction, use Liu Wei Wan for kidney deficiency, and Si Wu Decoction with Ren Shen and Qi for blood deficiency. For blood dryness or if water cannot nourish the wood element, use Si Wu Tang or Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For qi deficiency, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which should nourish the source of transformation effectively. If there is swelling and pain or fever, expel wind and clear heat. If there is both swelling and alternating cold and heat, or tension, disperse the exterior pathogens. For suppurating sores with swelling and pain, drain and detoxify. If pus has formed and pain persists, use a needle. If pus does not form, or if it does but does not drain, it is advisable to continue detoxification. If there is no contraction or pus is clear, a strong supplement is recommended.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Effects of Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong>  </p>
<p>Danxi discussed that dizziness can be classified into two types, both stemming from phlegm-heat disorders. Although dizziness is associated with phlegm-heat, it is also often caused by kidney deficiency combined with wind evil. Phlegm, being a flowing substance, is further aggravated by the movement of fire. The nature of fire is to rise; when wind is present, it intensifies, and thus the interaction of wind and fire increases the production of phlegm. The texts state: &quot;All dizzy spells caused by wind belong to the liver.&quot; The &quot;Original Definitions of Illness&quot; mentions that both wind and fire belong to Yang, which often causes mixed transformations. Yang governs movement; therefore, when both move and clash, it results in rotation. If a person suffers from dizziness and sudden nausea with a desire to vomit, experiencing blurred vision as though the room is spinning, and upon rising feels unsteady, one must ponder the underlying cause. It is said: tranquility leads to clarity, akin to the transformation of water. Turbulence and disturbance indicate the application of fire. The brain is born of the earthly essence, hence it harbors Yin upon the eyes, forming the connection of the pupils. The kidney water, which governs extreme Yin, values stillness and abhors disturbance. When tranquil, it maintains clarity within; when disturbed, it causes dizziness and disarray. This is what is meant by brain rotation leading to visual dizziness. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot Classic&quot; states: &quot;The essential Qi of the five organs and six bowels all ascends to the eyes as their essence.&quot;<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>The essence of muscles, bones, and vital energy, associated with the vessels, is linked to the eyes; it ascends to the brain and exits from the nape. Therefore, when evil resides in the nape, it seizes the body like a tiger. If it penetrates deeply, it follows the connection of the eyes to enter the brain. Once it enters the brain, the brain stirs; as the brain stirs, the connection of the eyes becomes tense; when the eyes become tense, it leads to dizziness. This is because the heart and kidneys do not harmonize, causing a combination of wind and fire. Wind has both internal and external distinctions; wind entering from the outside is combined with transformation, while that arising from within is fire giving rise to wind. Physicians examine the causes of internal injuries and external affections: a floating pulse with sweating indicates wind injury; a tight pulse without sweating, accompanied by muscle spasms and pain, indicates cold reception; a weak, fretful pulse indicates heat; a deep, sluggish pulse causing vomiting and reversal indicates dampness, while a consistently deep pulse signifies something different. As for emotional injuries (the seven emotions), they disrupt the balance of the organs and generate phlegm, which accumulates to form fluids, pushing upward with the qi, causing dizziness, pain in the brow, and inability to open the eyes. This condition can occur in women, as they are often inclined to anger. The classics say: the qi of heaven is called wind, and the qi of humans is called anger. Anger injures the liver&#39;s wood, which in turn generates wind, leading to a spinning sensation in the head and eyes, all stemming from this. Women, primarily reliant on yin blood, may suffer from dizziness due to loss from childbirth or dysfunctional bleeding that weakens their yang qi. Men may experience this condition due to losses from wounds, excessive vomiting, or the effects of alcohol and sexual activity, which exhausts their essence and blood, preventing the qi from returning to its origin and causing all qi to rise, resulting in dizziness. Students of medicine should differentiate between root and branch, separate their severity, and apply medication and treatment accordingly, like responding to the sound of a drum; everything will surely be effective.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br><strong>Headache and Wind-Related Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headache is a disease. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: &quot;Chest headache, attributed to the foot six meridians, and the hand lesser yin.&quot; True headache causes pain throughout the brain, accompanied by cold in the hands and feet to the joints, leading to death if untreated. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: &quot;When the three yang meridians of the hand are affected by wind and cold, remaining without relief, it is called chest headache. If it penetrates into the brain, it is termed true headache.&quot; The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: &quot;If the pulse at the cun (wrist) is weak, it is labeled as headache.&quot; The &quot;Pulse Classics&quot; states: &quot;When the yang (pulse) is taut, it results in headache.&quot; Furthermore, it states: &quot;If the cun pulse is floating, with headache caused by wind and heat; if the pulse is tight, the headache results from cold damage. Tight pulse at the cun indicates headache due to wind.&quot; The &quot;Pulse Treatise&quot; notes: &quot;Short and severe headaches may indicate imminent death; floating and slippery pulse suggest easy resolution of wind phlegm.&quot; The &quot;Neijing&quot; mentions: &quot;East wind arises in spring, affecting the liver, with the corresponding area at the head and neck, thus springtime ailments manifest as headaches. Furthermore, the various yang channels converge in the head and face, such as the foot taiyang bladder meridian, which emerges from the inner canthus of the eye, ascends to the top of the head, intermingles at the apex, enters and connects at the brain, and exits lower at the neck, resulting in tumultuous headaches.&quot;<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>The foot Shaoyang gallbladder meridian begins at the outer canthus of the eye, extending to the head and corner of the forehead, causing pain in these areas. If wind enters from above, wind-cold can injure the upper body; this external pathogen becomes a guest in the meridians, resulting in chills, headache, heaviness in the body, and aversion to cold. Treatment should be applied at Fengchi and Fengfu points to adjust yin and yang; if there is deficiency, it should be supplemented, and if there is excess sweating, it will resolve. This is a case of headache caused by exogenous cold.</p>
<p>For headache with ear ringing and blockage of the nine orifices, this arises from the intestines and stomach, indicating a deficiency in qi leading to headache. If headaches are accompanied by irritability, the issue lies within the diaphragm and involves the hand Taiyang and Shaoyin meridians, indicative of damp-heat headache. When qi rises but does not descend, resulting in vertex headaches, this points to deficiency below and excess above, related to the foot Shaoyin and Taiyang meridians, and in severe cases affecting the kidneys, leading to cold damp headache.</p>
<p>If there is pain on one side of the head, first treat the hand Shaoyang and Yangming meridians, then the foot Shaoyang and Yangming meridians; this is referred to as migraine. True headache, if severe, can connect to the brain; if the hands and feet become cold to the joints, it can cause sudden death in the morning or evening. Reverse headache indicates a severe cold invading, reaching the marrow; since the marrow is subordinate to the brain, this causes the headache and similar pain in the teeth.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>East Garden says: All head pains commonly treat with wind medicine, summarily saying this. At the high peaks, only wind can reach; the thinness of the soothing medicine, the yang in the yin, rises from the earth to the sky. However, there are also three yin and three yang diseases. For taiyang head pain, with aversion to wind, the pulse is floating and tight; commonly used are Chuanxiong, Qianghuo, Duhuo, and Mahuang. For shaoyang head pain, the pulse is wiry and weak, with alternating chills and fever; commonly used is Chaihu. For yangming head pain, with spontaneous sweating, fever, aversion to cold, and a pulse that is floating, relaxed, and long; commonly used are Shengma, Gegeng, Shigao, and Baizhi. For taiyin head pain, there must be phlegm; heavy body and abdominal pain indicate phlegm accumulation, with a pulse that is deep and relaxed; commonly used are Cangzhu, Banxia, and Nanzi. For shaoyin head pain, in which the three yin and three yang channels do not circulate in the two feet, with cold qi, reversing to form cold counterflow, the pulse is deep and thin; commonly used are Mahuang, Fuzi, and Xixin. For jueyin head pain, with neck pain and vomiting phlegm, or vomiting foamy saliva and feeling cold, the pulse is floating and relaxed; Wuzhuyu decoction is the main remedy for this.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>For headaches caused by blood deficiency, the main herbs are Angelica and Chuanxiong. For headaches due to Qi deficiency, the main herbs are Ginseng and Astragalus. The primary herbs are those that treat the condition effectively. If there are accompanying symptoms, they should be addressed with auxiliary herbs; this is the essential method for establishing a formula. For headaches that involve both Qi and blood deficiency, use the Decoction to Regulate the Center and Tonify Qi, with a slight addition of Chuanxiong, Vitex fruit, and Asarum, which has effects that are extensive. Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction is used for headaches caused by phlegm obstruction. Qingkong Ointment treats headaches caused by wind, dampness, and heat. Qianghuo Fuzhu Decoction addresses headaches with reversal of flow. If dampness is located in the head, it should be expelled with bitterness; one must not rigidly adhere to formulas for treatment. The principles for treating headaches are thoroughly detailed. In discussions of headaches in scholarly texts, why are these principles not explicitly stated? I will summarize. As for headaches caused by pathogenic factors, there is a singular pathogenic influence, differing only in terms of duration and retention. Those that are shallow and recent are termed headaches; their onset is sudden, and they easily dissipate. Those that are deep and chronic are called headaches due to wind, characterized by recurring pain that does not last consistently and may relapse upon exposure after recovery. All these should be verified based on the source of the pathogenic factor for proper treatment.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>In the &quot;Trial Efficacy Form,&quot; it is recorded that the elderly Jiegu suffered from headaches in his youth. Whenever the headaches struck, his cheeks would turn bluish-yellow, he would feel dizzy, his eyes would not want to open, he was lazy in speech, and his body felt heavy, as if he were about to vomit. This condition would last several days before passing. He said this was a disease caused by the combination of the Taiyin and Jueyin, named &quot;wind-phlegm.&quot; He used water to prepare the Jinhua pill and applied moxibustion to the two points of Xiexi, each for 27 times, and he recovered in not more than ten days. From this, one can observe that this is indeed a case of head wind. To not mention &quot;wind&quot; here refers to the essence of the meridian; what the world calls &quot;wind&quot; refers to the symptom. Why not clarify that headaches from Shaoyang and Jueyin make one experience unilateral headaches, where the evil arises from the liver and gallbladder with the wind-wood? Later generations thus named it &quot;head wind,&quot; which can be seen as not seeking its origin. Jiagu stated that the primary condition of major head wind signifies excessive邪热 (evil heat) of the Yangming, supported by the solid fire of Shaoyang. It often appears in Shaoyang, or in Yangming, or transmits from Taiyang. The treatment depends on where the swelling is located, following the corresponding meridian for healing.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>Humidity and heat cause swelling, while an excess of water leads to pain. This affliction manifests as headaches, specifically in the area before the ears, indicating its source. It is advisable not to use strong drugs hastily for treatment; doing so may exacerbate the condition. This means that if the heat at the top is not resolved, and cold re-emerges in the middle, it will surely jeopardize one&#39;s life. </p>
<p>This ailment, arising from external influences, is essentially a blood-related illness. Particularly, when the head is affected, where the affliction is intangible, treatment should start gently and gradually escalate. The initial gentle approach refers to the evils residing above, affecting the intangible parts. Since they are formless, they can infiltrate anywhere; if harsh medications are used too quickly, it becomes difficult to manage the condition. Even if gentle remedies are employed, taking them hastily—either before meals or in one go—will misalign the gentle approach, rendering the medicine ineffective against the ailment. Therefore, it is necessary to slowly and thoroughly address the intangible evils.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the nature and flavor of the medicine do not deviate from the gentle approach. Moreover, urgent treatment is to be administered when gentle remedies have already purged, allowing the evil influences to enter more deeply into the body, affecting the tangible qualities. If they are not swiftly eliminated, it will damage the yin. This urgent treatment pertains to the guest evils that need to be expelled quickly. </p>
<p>When treating the root illness, gentler remedies are suggested; this refers to the yang evils above and the yin evils below—your primary illness. If treated hastily, it can disrupt the balance and increase confusion.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>To treat guests with urgency means to expel the evil of yin when it is received by yang, and the evil of yang when it is received by yin. This is the guest qi, which should be urgently eliminated. For example, if the lesser yang and yangming are the evils manifesting before and after the ears, when yangming is the evil, it presents as significant swelling. One should first use the formula of Huangqin, Huanglian, and Gancao decoction, prepared by lightly frying, and take it continuously in small amounts; if there is no improvement after finishing, use freshly roasted rat glue on a new tile, wait until fragrant, and combine with Dahuang for decoction, removing the residue, then add Mangxiao, all in equal portions, and sip it from time to time, avoiding food beforehand. With slight benefits, the evil qi will dissipate. For the remedies that follow the yangming channel, herbs like Shengma, Gegeng, Shaoyao, and Gancao are used; for the greater yang channel, Qianghuo and Fangfeng are among them. Additionally, Dongyuan&#39;s treatments are evidenced by his established formulas. </p>
<p>In the four seasons, when many people are afflicted with epidemics, they first feel the onset of cold and heaviness in their bodies, followed by swelling of the head and face, making it hard to open their eyes, leading to wheezing and difficulty in the throat, with a dry tongue and parched mouth. It is commonly said that &quot;big head disease&quot; arises from seasonal changes. Relatives avoid visiting each other due to concerns about transmission. Those who fall ill with this condition for five to six days, are treated with Chengqi Decoction plus Lankeng, which offers slight respite; on the following day, however, the illness returns as usual, and even with another dose, there is only temporary alleviation, ultimately failing to achieve a cure.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>In ancient wisdom, it is said: The upper half of the body contains the energy of heaven; the lower half contains the energy of the earth. When disruptive heat resides between the heart and lungs, it causes swelling in the head, eyes, neck, and shoulders. The remedy is to drain this heat from the stomach, which is justified and necessary, though one may not understand the reason for it. </p>
<p>Thus, a prescription is formulated: Huangqin and Huanglian, both bitter and cold, are used to drain heat from the heart as the sovereign; Juhong, bitter and neutral, Yuanshen, bitter and cold, Shenggancao, sweet and cold, and Renshen, sweet and warm, are used for draining fire and tonifying qi as the ministers; Lianqiao, Shuzhizi, and Bohe, all spicy and neutral, Banlangen, bitter and cold, Mabo and Bai Jiangcan, both bitter and neutral, are used for dispersing swelling and disinfecting as assistants; Shengma and Chaihu, which are neutral, are not to be neglected in the Shaoyang and Yangming channels, while Jiegeng, spicy and warm, serves as the vessel to prevent downward movement.</p>
<p>All these ingredients are ground into a fine powder. Half is mixed with boiling white water to drink at intervals; the other half is made into pills with honey to be dissolved in the mouth. When consumed fully, it leads to improvement. If the stool is hard, one should add a qian or two of wine-cooked Dahuang to aid it; if swelling is severe, it may warrant lancing. These methods deeply understand the path of the illness, detailing a complete argument, and are intended as guidance for future generations.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles: Six Essentials</strong><br><em>Ming Dynasty - Zhang Sanyao</em><br><strong>Headache</strong>  </p>
<p>For headache due to cold damage, the pulse is floating and tight, the body feels rigid and cold, the back is strong with chills, and there is high fever. This corresponds to a cold damage headache. In winter, use Mahuang Decoction; in other months, use Qianghuo Conghui Decoction. </p>
<p>For headache due to wind damage, the pulse is slow and floating, or the left pulse is slightly rapid, accompanied by nasal congestion, swollen eyes, and red eyes, this corresponds to a wind damage headache. It is advisable to relieve the muscles; in winter, use Guizhi Decoction; in other months, use Shiwwei Qiang Su Drink.</p>
<p>For fire headache, the pulse at Inch position is surging and large, accompanied by dryness of the mouth and red eyes, indicating excess fire in the upper jiao. It is advisable to clear and disperse while also descending; use Chuanxiong Chaodao Powder, adding wine, Qinjiao, Lianhua, Ziziphus, and gypsum. If the condition is severe and the pulse is solid, use cooked rhubarb to drain fire. Danxi&#39;s method suggests using half a tael of wine and rhubarb, decocting and taking it as a medicine.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Food stagnation headache: The pulse at the right guan position is slippery and full, accompanied by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, a feeling of oppression in the chest, or alternating chills and fever, indicating a food stagnation headache. The treatment should use Erchen Decoction, adding hawthorn, magnolia bark, bitter orange, and medicated leaven.</p>
<p>Phlegm blockage headache: The pulse at the two cun positions is slippery and taut, often with symptoms of nausea and vomiting clear mucus, and a feeling of heaviness, indicating a phlegm blockage headache. Use Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction.</p>
<p>Damp-heat headache: The pulse is rapid and soft, or at the two cun positions is deep and rapid, with a heavy body and joint heaviness, or swelling in the limbs and face, indicating a damp-heat headache. This is often seen in drinkers; it is advisable to dispel dampness and resolve heat with Erchen, Erzhutong, Jiuqin, Qianghuo, and Fengfeng. If it persists, use the nasal method.</p>
<p>For those with widespread body pain, fever, a yellow complexion, wheezing, nasal congestion, restlessness, and headache, this indicates dampness above. Use Guati San to expel it through the nose.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>Qi deficiency headache presents with a strong but weak pulse on the right side; it may feel faint or weak, or be taut. The pulse may be robust at both wrists. Accompanying symptoms include lethargy in the limbs, loss of appetite, and a bland, tasteless mouth. This indicates a headache due to qi deficiency. The treatment is Sijunzi Decoction with added Astragalus and Vitex. Alternatively, you can adjust the Zhongyiyiqi Decoction with Vitex, and for severe cases, add Asarum.</p>
<p>Blood deficiency headache shows a weak and large pulse on the left, which may be thin and rapid. It manifests as an attack from the tail of the fish ascending to the head, indicating a headache due to blood deficiency. The treatment is a strengthened Siwu Decoction with a greater amount of Chuanxiong and some wine-infused Scutellaria.</p>
<p>Gout-related headache features a fine and slow or thin pulse, along with pain in the joints and limbs, constipation, possible vomiting, and weakness in the knees, suggesting a gout condition; it should be treated accordingly.</p>
<p>Yangming syndrome presents with headache at the forehead and possibly accompanied by nasal congestion, with a floating and long pulse, indicating a condition affecting Yangming. The treatment includes Licorice, scallion whites, and Angelica dahurica as the main herbs.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>Sweating, a surging pulse, and thirst belong to the interior pattern of Yangming. The treatments include Baihu Decoction, Jiedu Decoction, and Chengqi Decoction. The three Yin pulses reach the neck and chest but do not follow to the head, only the Jueyin pulses travel behind the throat, connecting to the eyes and the top of the head; hence, there is headache, often accompanied by vomiting of saliva and phlegm, coldness in the limbs, and a generally deep and hidden pulse, which is managed by Wuzhuyu Decoction.</p>
<p>A pulse that is deep and thin, with coldness in the feet and perhaps slight heat in the body along with headache, indicates interior deficiency receiving cold; this resembles the Taiyang pulse appearing like the Shaoyin one, treated with Mahuang Fuzi Xixin Decoction. Fuzi warms the interior, Mahuang disperses cold, and adding Xixin makes it a strong diaphoretic.</p>
<p>If a headache persists, it is either due to fire or wind, or there is phlegm above the diaphragm. A strong brew of tea, one bowl, can provoke the expulsion of bitter water and should stop when done; it does not harm the person and awaits thirst to cease. For common people, headaches often result from fire and phlegm.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>When wind-heat is present above, and the pulse is floating and rapid with pain, one should use Tianma, Jingzi, Taixiong, and Jiuqin. For Shaoyang headache with constipation, one may consider a purgative. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by sore poison, with a wiry and rapid pulse, if there has been a history of plum pit syndrome and the pain persists, or there is pain in the throat or one area of the arm, this is related to sore poison. Few doses of Yudu decoction can help alleviate it. </p>
<p>The great principle states: &quot;Only wind can reach the heights.&quot; For all headaches resulting from phlegm, fire, qi, and blood, wind-dispelling herbs are necessary, such as Jingjie, Chuanxiong, mint, Qianghuo, Baizhi, and the like, along with guiding herbs. The three yang channels of the hands and feet all connect upwards to the head, hence the saying, &quot;Six yang converge at the head.&quot; The six yin channels circulate around the neck and return, but only the Jueyin channel ascends to the throat, connecting to the eyes and emerging at the forehead, indicating that headaches should be distinguished according to the seven channels. </p>
<p>Due to pathogens affecting the primary channels, there may be fire or phlegm present, with an obstructed pulse pathway causing pain. Each case should be considered in its location: Taiyang at the back, Yangming at the forehead, encircling the nose and teeth, Shaoyang at both temples, and Jueyin associated with the crown, often leading to excessive salivation. Seek out wind and fire, whether in qi or blood, differentiate between deficiency and excess, and ascertain the nature of the illness.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br><strong>Head Shaking</strong></p>
<p>Head shaking is attributed to wind and fire, often seen in elderly individuals suffering after illness, mostly due to deficiency. This is caused by the deficiency of vital energy and blood, which allows fire to rise and stir.</p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness is primarily associated with phlegm and fire, but treatment should vary based on the degree of deficiency or excess. In overweight individuals with a soft and slippery pulse, it is due to damp phlegm, and a formula of Atractylodes, Pinellia, and Gastrodia is effective. In lean individuals with a tense and rapid pulse, it indicates Yin deficiency and rising internal fire, thus nourishing Yin to extinguish the fire is recommended. If the pulses are weak and the complexion is pale and haggard, it points to Qi deficiency leading to phlegm and turbid Qi that rises, causing dizziness. This is often seen in those with depression and among women, so soothing the depression is advised. </p>
<p>Middle-aged individuals experiencing a major illness when their vital energy has not yet recovered may feel dizzy or faint upon rising. Their pulse will be weak and slow, or the pulse of the right wrist may be large yet weak. Strengthening the middle and replenishing Qi with double the amounts of Ginseng and Astragalus, adding Gastrodia, and if there is phlegm, including Er Chen Tang, and if there is fire, adding toasted Coptis is beneficial. </p>
<p>In summer, if dizziness occurs due to overexertion in the heat, the pulse will be weak and fine, accompanied by irritability and thirst, indicating heat injury. First, use Six-One Powder and later apply a large dose of Sheng Mai San with Coptis added. </p>
<p>Dizziness arises from a condition of excess above and deficiency below.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>The so-called lower deficiency refers to blood and qi; the so-called upper excess refers to phlegm and fire rising. When in urgency, treat phlegm and fire; when in a more relaxed state, nourish the original qi. </p>
<p>A pulse that is string-like, strong, and accompanied by thirst and restlessness indicates an excess of phlegm and fire, possibly due to excessive drinking. It is advisable to reduce fire and transform phlegm using herbs like wine, Scutellaria, Gardenia, the Two Chen herbs, bitter orange, tangerine, mint, Schizonepeta, and another Scutellaria. If there is no nausea, boil two or three qian of rhubarb with wine. </p>
<p>For mid-abdomen damp phlegm that obstructs the clear pathways, leading to dizziness, the pulse must be slow and weak, and it is appropriate to stabilize the stomach and drain dampness. </p>
<p>Wind-phlegm causing dizziness, headache, and nausea with sour vomiting requires a preparation of Banxia, Nanshen, and Bai Fuzhi, ground into powder, and molded into pills the size of a tung seed, coated with raw flour and air-dried. Take ten to twenty pills with ginger soup. </p>
<p>If the head and face prefer warmth and the pulse stabilizes upon pressure, this indicates a yang deficiency, and large doses of ginseng and astragalus are appropriate. </p>
<p>In cases of strong phlegm and weak qi, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added astragalus and a slight amount of fried Fuzhi, decoct together, and mix with bamboo sap and ginger juice.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Tianma, Jingjiesui, and mint are excellent remedies for dispelling wind-heat from the upper body, but they are not fundamental treatments. To treat phlegm with phlegm, to treat fire with fire, or to supplement qi, blood, or nourish yin, it is essential to transform and open the pathways.</p>
<p>For those who have lost blood and experience dizziness, use Xionggui Decoction. For stagnant blood in the chest, drinking leek juice mixed with wine is beneficial.</p>
<p>When wind-heat affects the upper body, presenting with a floating and rapid pulse, along with symptoms of headache and red eyes representing alternating chills and fever, use Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder.</p>
<p>If the pulses in both hands are weak and large, appetite decreases, you feel a slight thirst, and bowel movements occur only every three to four days, then this is a sign of great deficiency due to blood loss. In this case, prepare a strong decoction of ginseng, astragalus, rhubarb, and peony root, and add thirty pills of Lianqiao. Lianqiao should be stir-fried in ginger juice. In winter, add a small amount of dried ginger and further boil the pills in ginger juice until thickened.</p>
<p>In the cold of winter, if you experience dizziness, phlegm and saliva can contribute to this sensation, thus treat with warming methods. </p>
<p>If dizziness arises upon waking, it will stabilize after a short while, indicating that old phlegm in the stomach is the cause; the ancient method involves using Heixidan to remedy it.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>Medicinal herbs such as cinnamon, aconite, agarwood, magnetite, black tin, mugwort, old paper, fennel, yang qi, golden bell, and patchouli are strongly pungent and hot, likely leading to an exacerbation of illness. It is preferable to use the medicine of stone to settle the condition, taking effect gradually. Also, it is best to be careful with diet.</p>
<p>In ancient remedies, five qian of deer antler is used, boiled in wine broth, with a small amount of musk added, to treat the deficiency of yang. This is suitable for dizziness arising from a yang deficiency that shows no heat. Dizziness is fundamentally associated with the rising of false fire, stirring phlegm upwards, affecting the eyes, which is why there is tinnitus; when the eyes move, it feels as if the house is also moving. The brain is the sea of marrow; if it is full of vitality, fire cannot ascend, which is why young people do not suffer from this condition. There are also those with inherent weakness who experience this, which cannot always be explained by common theory. Danxi said: dizziness is a gradual onset of wind stroke. After middle age and following major illness, it is essential to nourish and supplement the body, abstaining from alcohol and lust, to ensure there are no worries. </p>
<p>Postpartum blood circulation also tends to be deficient. Those who are fat and pale should supplement qi, while those who are dark should supplement blood, each with the addition of childhood urine, ginger juice, and bamboo juice to lower the excessive false fire. Avoid cool remedies.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p>
<h3>Thunder-Head Wind</h3>
<p>Headaches are characterized by a swollen lump, which may be red and inflamed, or accompanied by chills and feverish urgency, all caused by wind-heat combined with fire attacking upward. &quot;Thunder&quot; pertains to the fire of the phase, hence the name. Ancient prescriptions use Shengma and Cangzhu, adding lotus leaves, called Shengma Decoction. However, the Jingfang Baidu Powder is more convenient.</p>
<h3>Headache</h3>
<p>For headaches, the cold pathogen enters the Foot Taiyang channel, attacking the head from above; this is a surface pattern. In headaches, there is a floating and tight pulse, with no sweating and aversion to cold, which allows for the use of sweating methods; if the pulse is floating and relaxed, with sweating and aversion to cold, one should resolve the muscles. Use medications in accordance with the proper season. In Yangming disease, there is no aversion to cold, instead there is aversion to heat, with constipation lasting five or six days, along with full stomach thirst, heat rising to the head and eyes, and a solid pulse; one should regulate the stomach with Chengqi Decoction. For Shaoyang headaches, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction to harmonize them. For heavy-headedness and nasal congestion from dampness, use Guati Powder (to clear the nose); if yellow discharge comes out, it is cured. In cases of phlegm and mucus headaches, accompanied by chest fullness and chills or heat, use Guati Powder to induce vomiting. For Jueyin dry vomiting and foamy saliva headaches, Wu Zhu Yu Decoction should be the main remedy. Though the three Yang types may have headaches, the Taiyang is the primary one. The three Yin types do not have headaches, and only the Jueyin experiences headaches, as the pulse is connected at the apex. If the pain extends to the brain, with both hands and feet appearing blue, it indicates true headache, and death is certain. Generally speaking, headaches belonging to the three Yang types are caused by evil qi attacking upward. The Taiyang primarily governs headaches, but Yangming and Shaoyang may also experience them.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>In the Three Yin channels, the paths do not ascend above the head; only the Jueyin follows the throat and connects to the apex of the forehead, which is why symptoms such as headache, dry heaving, and the expectoration of saliva occur, yet without a fever, differing from Yang symptoms. However, wind-dampness resides in the Shaoyin, and damp warmth in the Taiyin, with their channels extending from the feet to the chest and back, so if a headache is excessively toxic, it should not be strictly limited. If both are influenced by cold, with the Taiyang and Shaoyin affected, symptoms include headache, dry mouth, and a feeling of fullness with thirst; if the headache is especially severe, extending to the chest with cold hands and feet, this is true headache and cannot be treated.</p>
<p>In Taiyang conditions with headache, fever, and chills but no sweat, the prescription is Ma Huang Tang; if there is sweat, use Gui Zhi Tang. If sweating has occurred but the headache still feels like it is splitting, use Ge Gen Cong Bai Tang. </p>
<p>In Taiyang conditions with a fine, rapid pulse and persistent headache, continue with Cong Bai Tang. </p>
<p>In Yangming headache, there is no aversion to cold but an aversion to heat, accompanied by no bowel movement for six or seven days due to food stagnation pressing upwards, so give a small dose of Xiao Wei Cheng Qi Tang.</p>
<p>In Shaoyang headache, the pulse is wiry and feverish; use Xiao Chai Hu Tang.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>Headache and fever, irritability, use Gardenia and Scutellaria Decoction.<br>If there is exhaustion due to movement, headache, and limb pain, use Scallion Soup.  </p>
<p>Regarding dizziness:  </p>
<p>Dizziness indicates a condition between the Lesser Yang and half-exterior and half-interior. The exterior pathogen has transmitted to the interior while the yang in the exterior is deficient, which causes dizziness. Additionally, if dizziness occurs after sweating and purging, it is also due to yang deficiency. In cases of Lesser Yin diarrhea, when it stops, dizziness occurs; if it happens frequently, this indicates extreme deficiency and collapse. In cases of Greater Yang disease, if purged, and sweating is induced again, both the interior and exterior become deficient, leading to dizziness. Those prone to dizziness sweat profusely and may recover. In Greater Yang disease accompanied by dizziness, without aversion to cold, able to eat yet coughs, use Licorice, Dried Ginger, Poria, and Atractylodes Decoction. For Lesser Yang syndrome with blurred vision, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. In Greater Yang disease, if sweating is induced and yet the sweating does not resolve, symptoms such as palpitations in the chest, dizziness, trembling of the body, and the tendons twitching as if wanting to strike the ground, use Zhen Wu Decoction. If after vomiting and sweating the pulse is deep and rapid, presenting with fullness in the chest, Qi moving under the ribs affecting the throat, causing difficulty in breathing, body shaking, and muscle twitching, prolonged cases may lead to weakness; in such cases, use Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes, and Licorice Decoction.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>In the realm of wind, there are also those who experience dizziness, as wind governs movement. If one sweats excessively, especially if one is weak and only sweats slightly, or if they catch a cold and sweat, using the major Qinglong Decoction indiscriminately can lead to symptoms of extreme reversals and muscle tremors, which relate to the Zhenwu Decoction. For the weakened, the peony should be omitted, and for those with heat, the Aconite should be excluded. If it is necessary to induce sweating, but there is moving qi in the abdomen, one should not sweat, as doing so will cause muscle tremors. If one experiences dizziness and continuous sweating from the head, the most counterproductive response is to first prevent with the Feng, Baizhu, and Muli Decoction, and then follow up with the Xiao Jianzhong Decoction, which can save one from dire circumstances. After vomiting and purging, if there is fullness below the heart and upward-pressing qi, causing dizziness upon standing, with a pulse that is deep, tight, and causing the body to shake, one should use the Fuling, Guizhi, Baizhu, and Gan Cao Decoction, which is effective over time. For a feeling of fullness and oppression below the heart, one should use the Zhi Juzi Decoction, adding Fuling and Gan Cao. </p>
<p><strong>From the Comprehensive Medical Collection, Volume 124, by Wang Kentang.</strong><a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion on Headaches</strong></p>
<p>Medical texts often differentiate between headaches and wind headaches as two categories; however, they are fundamentally the same condition, differing only in their timing and persistence. Those that are shallow and recent are called headaches, characterized by sudden onset, easily dispersed, and quick to resolve. In contrast, those that are deep and longstanding are classified as wind headaches, with pain that appears intermittently and can recur after recovery when triggered. It is essential to examine the source of the illness for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>In popular practice, headaches are treated by either addressing wind or cold, yet it is unclear if there are other underlying causes. To clarify, let us refer to the discussion in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding the causes of headaches. When wind enters from the outside, causing chills and sweating, it results in headaches. If one is newly washed and catches wind, the pain usually manifests on the following day, and one should avoid going out. When extreme cold penetrates deeply to the marrow, affecting the brain, this results in headache and toothache due to brain disturbance. </p>
<p>The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; at first, wind overwhelms, leading to shaking and warmth, accompanied by headache from the pathogenic forces accumulating above. The second force, fire, becomes repressed, and when dust rises, the disease is heat and stagnation above, leading again to headache. Under the governance of Lesser Yang, when heat overcomes, people suffer headaches with fever and chills akin to malaria. When the year&#39;s metal is insufficient, fiery heat prevails, leading to the reversal of yin and yang; headaches spread across the head and top, causing a sensation of heat. In the case of the Greater Yang&#39;s dominance, heat ascends, creating pain at the back of the head, neck, and brain, along with visual disturbances. When the Greater Yang retreats, cardiac pain and fullness occur alongside headaches. The Greater Yin governs dampness; when dampness overcomes, pain may be felt in the waist, spine, and head, often accompanied by dizziness. When the Greater Yin rises in the springs, if dampness prevails, it leads to headache, with the sensation of eyes bulging and neck feeling pulled.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>The return of the moon brings a headache, heavy and particularly severe. The return of Yangming causes coughing and distress in the heart, with illness in the diaphragm and headache. From a cold damage, if influenced by great Yang for a day, there is pain in the head and neck, and a stiffness in the lower back and spine. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that wind-dampness causes pain in the thighs and shins, feeling as if walking on ice, and sometimes like entering hot water. It causes distress, headache, dizziness at times, and feelings of sorrow or fear with shortness of breath, leading to death within three years. All these ailments are due to the six qi invading and dampening the true qi of clear Yang, causing pain. When headaches are very severe, there is intense pain in the brain, and the hands and feet become cold to the joints. Severe headaches indicate a deficiency below and fullness above, caused by kidney deficiency which fails to guide the qi of the bladder. Heart distress and headache and tinnitus occur when the nine orifices are obstructed, originating from the intestines and stomach. In cases of heart heat, there is sudden pain and agitation, with headache and facial redness, needing to needle the hand&#39;s Shaoyin and Taiyang. In cases of lung heat, the headache is unbearable, with sweating and chills, needing to needle the hand&#39;s Taiyin and Yangming. In cases of kidney heat, there is a dull pain in the neck, needing to needle the foot&#39;s Shaoyin and Taiyang. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that for Yangming headache, the face appears swollen, rising with heart distress, needing to needle the foot&#39;s Yangming and Taiyin. For an obstructed headache with painful head pulses, the heart feels sorrowful, needing to draw blood and treat with Jueyin. For an obstructed headache with a heavy and painful head, needling the hand and foot&#39;s Shaoyin is necessary. If the headache is associated with forgetfulness and is not alleviated by pressing, the left and right carotid arteries should be pressed, and then needle the foot&#39;s Taiyin. For a Yangming headache with preceding neck pain, and corresponding pain in the lower back and spine, first needle the Tianzhu and then the foot&#39;s Taiyang. For an obstructed headache with intense pain and hot pulsations in the front and back of the ears, bleed out the blood and then needle the foot&#39;s Shaoyang.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>Headaches cannot be treated through superficial points; when struck down, there is evil blood within. If there is pain from injury that has not yet resolved, one should select points on the side rather than from a distance. Headaches should not be punctured; great wind is harmful, and those afflicted daily may recover slowly, thus they must not despair. If there is cold pain in the head, first choose the hand’s Shao Yang and Yang Ming points, followed by the foot’s Shao Yang and Yang Ming points. The bladder, arising from the foot’s Tai Yang, causes pain in the top of the head. The gallbladder, arising from the foot’s Shao Yang, also causes headaches. All these conditions arise from the qi of the organs and meridians being reversed, disturbing the clear pathways of the head, leading to blockages in the meridians which result in pain. The head represents the heavens, where the clear yang qi of the three yangs and the six organs converge. Likewise, the refined essence and blood of the three yin and five organs also gather here. Thus, the six perverse influences from the weather and the five thieves of human qi can harm each other, either obscuring clarity or obstructing the meridians, resulting in an overwhelming condition that induces pain. When hot, the pulse is full; when full, there is pain. If the evil qi lingers, the pulse remains full and the qi and blood become chaotic, thus the pain is severe, and this pain is all substantive. If invaded by cold and damp, although the true qi is deficient, it does not combine to create heat. Yet the evil disrupts the pulse; externally there is blood clots and a cold pulse. When cold, the pulse tightens and contracts rapidly, leading to pain pulling on the small channels; apply warmth to relieve this pain, which is then considered empty. If the pain arises from wind and wood, there may be a pulling sensation from the evil wind, sometimes accompanied by sweating. If the pain is due to summer heat, there may be sweating or not, but it is all due to harmful heat causing pain. If the pain arises from dampness, there is a feeling of heaviness in the head, especially exacerbated by cloudy weather.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>Those who experience pain due to phlegm and fluids also suffer from dizziness and a heavy sensation in the head accompanied by a desire to vomit. Those who have pain caused by cold feel intense cold and discomfort. The pain is associated with the wind, cold, damp, and heat corresponding to the internal organs. Additionally, there is pain from Qi deficiency, which worsens with exertion, and the pulse feels large. In cases of blood deficiency leading to pain, the person feels easily startled, and the pulse is hollow. Based on these symptoms, along with careful examination, no case is overlooked.</p>
<p>For headache related to the three Yang channels: use Qiánghuó, Fángfēng, Jīngjiè, Shēngmá, Gègēn, Báizhǐ, Chái-hú, Chuānxiōng, Sháoyào, Xìxīn, and the white part of scallions.</p>
<p>For headaches of a Yin pattern, only warming tonics should be used, such as Lǐzhōng Decoction or Jiāng Fù.</p>
<p>For headaches due to wind, damp, and heat that obstruct the eyes and brain and cause lingering pains, it&#39;s crucial to clear the upper organs. For bitter headaches, add two qian of Xìxīn to the mixture; if the Taiyin pulse is slow with phlegm, known as phlegm obstruction headache, remove Qiánghuó, Fángfēng, Chuānxiōng, and Gāncǎo, adding one and a half liang of Bāxiàn; if migraines do not improve, reduce Qiánghuó, Fángfēng, and Chuānxiōng by half and double the amount of Chái-hú. </p>
<p>For headaches with fever, aversion to heat, and thirst, this is Yangming headache, and it should be treated with Bái Hǔ Tāng plus Báizhǐ.</p>
<p>For headaches that cause dizziness, blackened vision, and pain, use Ānshén Sǎn or Chuānxiōng Sǎn.</p>
<p>For heat-induced headaches, even in severe cold, there is a desire for a light breeze; warmth or smoke may provoke a recurrence of pain. In such cases, use Qīngshàng Xièhuǒ Tāng followed by a Qi-replenishing decoction.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by wind and heat, use Shígāo Sǎn or Jīngjiè Sǎn.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>In the winter month of great cold, the cold affects the brain, causing headaches and toothaches, known as &quot;Jue Ni.&quot; According to the discussion of strange diseases, it is advisable to use the Qiang Huo and Fu Zi Decoction. </p>
<p>For headaches, chest pain, reduced appetite, difficulty swallowing, coldness, and a rapid left cun pulse, it is suitable to use the Ma Huang and Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is damp heat in the head causing headaches, one must expel it with bitter herbs. For mild cases, use the Tuo Ding San (Top-Dissolving Powder), and swallow saliva through the nose. </p>
<p>Newly washed and then struck by wind is called &quot;first wind.&quot; If the head and face sweat excessively and are sensitive to wind, it is best to take care of the wind for one day, as more wind will lead to severe illness, and on the day of the wind, recovery will be slight. The Da Chuan Qiong Wan (Great Chuan Qiong Pill) is the treatment for this. </p>
<p>When wind energy travels through the wind palace upwards, it results in &quot;brain wind.&quot; There may be coldness in the back of the neck and extreme cold in the brain; the Shen Sheng San (Divine Holy Powder) is the treatment for this. </p>
<p>In general, when treating headaches, one should use acrid and warming herbs such as Qiong, Zhi, Qiang, and Feng, which elevate and disperse. This is because a deficiency in wood (the liver) fails to elevate and disperse, and when earth is scarce, it leads to blockages and pain. Thus, these herbs assist the liver&#39;s wood energy to disperse the blockage. However, if the wind is too excessive and dispersing too much leads to worsening pain, it is advisable to use sour, astringent herbs to descend it back to normal; similar remedies include Frankincense powder. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by blood deficiency, particularly those that ascend from the tail of the fish (the lumbar region), it is recommended to use Dang Gui and Chuan Qiong.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>One tael of angelica, one liter of wine, boil together until reduced to six parts, drink until intoxicated for effect.  </p>
<p>Two qian each of angelica, Chuanxiong, Forsythia, and prepared digitaria, decoct with water, strain out the dregs, add two qian of dracontium and mint powder, steep in boiling water, inhale its vapor, wait until warm to take, then lie down for effect.  </p>
<p>For headaches due to both qi and blood deficiencies, add Chuanxiong, Viticis, and Asarum to the Qi-tonifying Soup, its effect is remarkable.  </p>
<p>For phlegm and stroke headaches, black vision, head spinning, nausea, and agitation, the Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction is indicated. Phlegm stroke headaches are not treatable without Banxia. Black vision and head spinning indicate internal wind; Tianma alone can remedy this. Tianma seedlings are known as “calming wind herb,” unshaken by wind, a miraculous medicine to treat internal wind. Internal wind refers to deficient wind.  </p>
<p>Huangqi (astragalus) is sweet and warm, dispels fire and supplements vital qi, strengthens the exterior and stops spontaneous sweat.  </p>
<p>Ginseng is sweet and warm, regulates, supplements qi, and drains fire.  </p>
<p>Both Baizhu (white atractylodes) are sweet and warm, eliminate dampness and benefit the middle while enhancing qi.  </p>
<p>Zexie (alisma) and Fuling (poria) promote urination to drain dampness.  </p>
<p>Tangerine peel is bitter and warm, benefits qi, regulates the middle, and raises yang.  </p>
<p>Fried wheat (malt) aids in digestion and releases stagnation in the stomach.  </p>
<p>Dried ginger is spicy and hot, dispels middle cold.  </p>
<p>Huanglian (yellow-bitter) is bitter and cold, washed with wine to treat restlessness arising from low fire in winter.  </p>
<p>Nasal congestion, abdominal swelling, and headaches indicate a stomach-related illness.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>The Classic says: When the Yangming channel experiences guest and grandson pulses, there will be headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal swelling. This is because Yangming is associated with the upper body; thus, the grandson channel corresponds with Taiyin, leading to headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal swelling. For cases of heavy head, pain, and hot tidal sensations, they are related to the stomach. Dan Xi states: When headaches feel like they are splitting, take half a tael of dry-fried rhubarb and brew it with tea. Lou Quanshan asserts: If the headache is due to stomach issues, purgation is necessary for recovery. For example, Sun Zhao used the Li Ge medication to alleviate Zhang Xueshi&#39;s headache caused by food stagnation; Guo Maoxun used the He Long Dan to treat his sister-in-law&#39;s postnatal residual blood headache, and immediate purgation led to relief. </p>
<p>When there is agitation and headaches, the issue lies in the diaphragm. The problem resides in the hand&#39;s major Yang and minor Yin channels, treated with methods like Qing Kong Gao from Dong Yuan. Headaches that are severe at the top and accompanied by lower vacuity and upper fullness stem from the foot&#39;s minor Yin and major Yang. In severe cases, it even pertains to the kidneys; Xu Xueshi referred to this as kidney deviation headache. When the pulse is raised, it causes dizziness; when pressed, it feels stiff. Treat this with Yu Zhen Wan. Dai Fu’an used Zheng Yuan San or Da San Wu Qi San, to be taken with salt. Alternatively, add fifteen fried peppers into Zheng Yuan San, then take it after boiling with Fu Dan, sometimes incorporating He Xi Dan. If various medications are ineffective and pain intensifies, Ru Zhu Dan should be considered. </p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Headaches that are severe at the top, with lower vacuity and upper fullness, are related to the foot&#39;s minor Yin and major Yang and can severely involve the kidneys.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>In cases of dizziness and deafness, there is a deficiency below and excess above, leading to issues in the Shao Yang and Jue Yin channels, which may even affect the liver. A deficiency below indicates a deficiency in the kidneys, hence kidney deficiency leads to headaches. A deficiency above indicates a deficiency in the liver, thus a liver deficiency causes head dizziness. Dizziness is likened to having something covering the head, resulting in instability. Dizziness and deafness are manifestations of this condition. Therefore, liver deficiency leads to head dizziness, while kidney deficiency causes vertex pain—these are different. For liver deficiency, Gui Tou Decoction is recommended.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by food stagnation, symptoms include chest fullness, sour taste in the throat, aversion to food, and although there may be fever, the body does not ache; it is advisable to use the Middle-Jiao Decoction with a gram of sand ginger, or a red pill.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by alcohol, with nausea and vomiting of residual alcohol, dizziness, and unsteady sensations, it is best to use the Ge Hua Detoxification Decoction.</p>
<p>Anger injures the liver and causes liver qi to ascend to the brain, leading to headaches; thus, use the Chen Xiang Jiang Qi Powder along with Su Zi Jiang Qi Decoction, and the Yang Zheng Pill.</p>
<p>In cases of upward heat causing redness, swelling, and pain in the head and eyes, along with chest discomfort, inability to lie down comfortably, coldness from the waist down, and mild constipation, it is advisable to use the Ji Ji Detoxification Decoction.</p>
<p>For headaches with external foul smell and toxicity, taking a single herb, fried cyperus, cures the condition.</p>
<p>For headaches accompanied by eye pain, combine gypsum and mouse glue, fry them into a powder, and mix with clear tea before eating.</p>
<p>For head wind (wind headache), sneezing, use Bai Zhi Powder, Chuan Xiong Powder, Ru Jin Powder, Gourd Stalk Mystical Powder, Huo Tong Powder, and Yu Jin Powder.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br><strong>Thunderhead Wind</strong></p>
<p>This condition refers to a headache accompanied by lumps. Some say it feels like the sound of thunder. It arises from the invasion of wind pathogens; when the wind moves, it produces sound. Zhang Zi He used tea to adjust the powder and induce vomiting, then followed with Shen Xiong pills to purge it, after which he took Wu Jing pills and similar remedies to eliminate wind. </p>
<p>For severe cases, Cooling Barrier Powder and Disperse Wind, Clear Heat remedy are employed. If there are red, swollen lumps on the head, resembling sour jujubes, using a fine needle to draw blood may cure it. There are also cases caused by phlegm and fire; phlegm generates heat, and heat generates wind. When phlegm ascends and blocks the airways, compounded by wind, it naturally produces sound—light like a cicada&#39;s chirp, heavy like the rumble of thunder—hence the name Thunderhead Wind. </p>
<p>The remedy includes half summer (banxia), tooth soap, and ginger juice, boiled in one or two parts; soak in yellow rice wine until fully absorbed, then wrap in damp paper and simmer, repeating this soaking and simmering three times, using two parts. Additionally, include five qian each of white silkworms, forsythia, tangerine peel, platycodon, and gastrodia; seven qian of fried scutellaria with wine; and three qian of mint leaves; one qian each of white angelica, blue mineral stone, and powdered grass. Grind these into a powder, moisten with water, and form into pills the size of laburnum seeds. After eating, lie down and swallow two qian with tea, regulating the expulsion of phlegm, then use clear phlegm and fire-reducing decoctions for further treatment.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br><strong>True Headache</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly Gate hurts truly, pulling up to the brain, causing death at dusk and awakening at dawn; death at dawn and awakening at dusk. The brain is where the essence of marrow gathers, and it is intolerant of evils; if it suffers from evil, death is inevitable and untreatable. An ancient formula states that with black tin pills, moxibustion at Baihui, and the vigorous addition of ginseng, sandalwood, black, and attached (herbs), one may have a chance of recovery. However, if the heavenly pillar is broken, it is also difficult to exert power.</p>
<p><strong>Large Head Disease</strong></p>
<p>When the head swells large like a bowl, this is indeed a seasonal epidemic of the heavens. In the East, during the supervision of Ji Yuan taxes, there are many epidemics in the prolonged summer. Initially, there is a dislike of cold and a heavy body, followed by swelling of the face and eyes. One cannot open their eyes, breathes with difficulty, the throat feels obstructed, the tongue is dry, and the mouth parched; it is commonly called the large-headed disease invoked by the heavens. Thus, I prescribe a formula using Huanglian and Huangsuo, bitter and cold, to drain heat from the heart and lungs as the monarch; Juhong (tangerine peel) and Yuanshen (scrophularia), also bitter and cold, combined with sweet licorice to drain fire and replenish qi as the minister; Lianqiao (forsythia), Shuzi (rubus), and Bohe (mint), bitter and spicy yet neutral, Banlan Gen (isatis) with a sweet and cold flavor; Mapi Bo (a type of herb), and Baijiang Can (silkworm) are bitter and neutral, dispersing swelling and detoxifying to quell cough as assistants; Shengma (cimicifuga) and Chaihu (bupleurum), bitter and neutral, guide the qi of the Shaoyang and Yangming channels; and Jiegeng (platycodon) with a spicy and warming flavor serves as a vessel to prevent downward movement. </p>
<p>Grind all to a fine powder, mix with decoction, and take regularly; mold into pills with honey and dissolve in the mouth for complete recovery. Thus, the complete formula has helped many, named the Universal Detox Drink. Other variations include Black and White Powder, Sweet Tangerine Decoction, adding Shuzi, Lianqiao, Dahuang (rhubarb), Yuanming Powder, Baijiang Can, and Jing Jie (schizonepeta).<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br><strong>Head Winds and Dandruff</strong></p>
<p>Luo Qianfu said: When the liver channel is strong with wind, the wood naturally shakes. The Book of Documents states: &quot;Fulfillment invites loss.&quot; The Tao Te Ching states: &quot;When things grow strong, they grow old.&quot; Therefore, when wood overcomes earth, metal comes to counter it; this is the child taking (revenge) on the mother. If combing your hair reveals white flakes, it points to lung conditions, as the lungs govern the skin and hair. If the stool is hard, use the Qingwan pills; if weak, use Ren Shen Xiao Feng San. The Wàn Bìng Zǐ Yuàn Pills treat excessive dandruff; take three to seven pills with ginger soup. Note that the above treatment must be used when there are symptoms of wind-heat attacking the head, causing dizziness and pain. If there are merely white flakes, it is best to use external treatments like Bai Zhi or Ling Ling Xiang.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Head</strong></p>
<p>What causes a heavy head? It is due to the external dampness of the heavens and the internal phlegm from the body rising up. It can also result from the inversion of the yin energy from below, all leading to a heavy head. How do we know this? The head resembles the heavens, and its energy is extremely clear. The energy of the earth, however, is heavy and turbid; the earth represents yin and humidity. When external dampness combines with internal steam, it must obstruct the clear pathways, leading to poor circulation of qi and blood, causing heaviness. The Inner Classic states: &quot;Yang energy is affected by dampness, causing the head to feel wrapped, indicating external dampness covering it.&quot; It also states: &quot;For those with spleen heat, the initial symptom is a heavy head, as the stomach channel brings the heat upward to the head.&quot;<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br><strong>Nod</strong> </p>
<p>Nod, it is both wind and a person. Both act actively, meeting at the peak, thus it is called a nod. The Inner Canon says: &quot;Fluctuating, obscured and beckoning, eyes closed and ears deaf, fullness below and emptiness above, with issues in the lesser yang and the jueyin.&quot; The commentary explains: &quot;Fluctuating&quot; refers to a disease. &quot;Obscured&quot; means unclear vision. &quot;Beckoning&quot; indicates an unsteady sway. &quot;Severe&quot; means significant. When vision is unclear and the head sways severely. Moreover, when the Taiyin recurs, it causes heavy pain in the head and neck, with severe swaying and shaking. The commentary states this arises from internal dampness reversing, lingering in the chest from the sun and causing a swaying illness. The Spiritual Pivot mentions that in the governing channel’s divergence, if it is deficient, the head might feel heavy and sway high. Thus, the pathologies referred to as dizziness and swaying are all related to the liver and wood. The top of the head is where the foot taiyang passes, where the governing channel meets the jueyin, hence the fire reversed from the three channels gathers here, and all swaying arises from wind and wood. Zhang Zhongjing also stated that when the heart is extinguished, it directly corresponds to nodding the head.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br><strong>Headache Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Floating and tight indicates the Taiyang; string-like and thin suggests the Shaoyang; floating and relaxed points to the Yangming; sinking and relaxed signifies the Taiyin; sinking and thin reflects the Shaoyin; floating and relaxed indicates the Jueyin; floating and string-like denotes wind; floating and surging indicates fire. A strong or forceful right cun pulse could be either slippery or string-like, indicative of phlegm-fire accumulation; a thin or relaxed pulse with a heavy body suggests dampness. A left pulse that is insufficient indicates blood deficiency; a right pulse that is insufficient signals qi deficiency; both sides weak represent a deficiency of both qi and blood. A tight and exuberant right cun indicates food accumulation; a large surging right guan indicates stomach heat attacking upwards. A thin string-like pulse at the inch indicates wind and cold phlegm above the diaphragm, possibly leading to vomiting; a sinking thin pulse suggests hidden toxins from a cold-induced illness, where headaches occur without high fever, resulting in severe headache and ocular pain; a rapid and short pulse signifies impending death.</p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness refers to blackening of vision. Movement, as in rotation, is commonly referred to as a spinning head. According to the Inner Canon, dizziness is related to the liver and wood element, corresponding to deficiencies above. Danxi emphasizes replenishing deficiencies and treating phlegm to lower fire. Zhongjing also prioritizes phlegm and fluids in treating dizziness. Zhao Yide states that Danxi speaks of fire, and the Dao is everywhere. What is the Dao? It embodies yin and yang, water and fire. The clear and tranquil aspects represent the transformation of water; the disturbing and chaotic aspects typify the function of fire. The brain is born of earthly qi, thus it is housed in yin. The pupils of the eyes are also governed by the kidney&#39;s water element. Therefore, both are inclined toward tranquility and dislike disturbance. Tranquility leads to clarity, while disturbance results in disorder; thus, when the brain turns and vision is dizzy, it is due to fire.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: The essence and energy of the five organs and six fu are all directed upwards towards the eyes, and the essence of muscles, bones, blood, and qi, as well as the vessels, are related to the eyes and ascend to the back of the brain, emerging from the neck. Therefore, when evil enters through the neck, if it encounters a deficiency in the body, it goes deep and follows the connection to the eyes into the brain. Once it enters the brain, the brain moves; when the brain moves, it causes the eyes to become urgent. When the connection of the eyes is frantic, it leads to dizziness and rotation. The so-called evils refer to various external and internal pathogens of wind, cold, dampness, and heat. However, these evils are all attributed to the effects of fire. What is dizziness? The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that all winds that cause dizziness belong to the wood element of the liver, specifically referring to wind evils. The &quot;Yuan Bing Shi&quot; explains this: Wind and fire are both yang, and often transform together; yang governs movement. When two movements clash, the head and eyes become dizzy and spin. Fire is inherently dynamic; when flames are combined with wind, they naturally rotate, resulting in dizziness and swaying. Dizziness refers to confusion and chaotic rotation. Is this not caused by wind evils initiated by fire? However, wind can originate both internally and externally; the external ones are combined with fire transformations, while internal outbreaks are particularly due to wind generated from fire.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>In the examination of various texts, it is said that the Qi of the Jueyin governs the heavens. When there is victory in Jueyin, symptoms like tinnitus and dizziness appear, which correspond to the dominance of Jueyin. This Qi governing the heavens enters from above. Additionally, when the annual wood Qi is excessive, it leads to symptoms of dizziness, irritability, and an overflowing of the liver and lungs, often causing forgetfulness and sudden dizzy spells. Furthermore, when the lesser yang and Jueyin are excessive, it affects vision, causing flickering and obscurity. The Chao family also notes that pain under the ribs and headaches indicate a full liver. This may arise from the liver responding to the weather or from the internal movements of Qi, termed as &quot;wind&quot; rather than flames of fire, which cannot ascend to the head. As for the excessive wood Qi, it can severely result in tinnitus, dizziness, inability to recognize others, and a tendency to faint or collapse, particularly when the fire within the liver wood is intense. This internal response of weather Qi in the organs, associated with the liver&#39;s state of excess or deficiency, is likewise referred to as internal wind.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>It is said that when the Taiyang (greater Yang) is prevailing, heat rises, causing pain in the head, neck, and brain, as well as eyes appearing to protrude. The commentary states that this is due to cold qi oppressing and overwhelming the Yang, which cannot resist. The qi of Taiyang is located at the summit, and its entry into the brain is why this disease manifests in this manner. It is said that Taiyang governs the heavens and is associated with sadness and vertigo.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says that when evil resides in the heart, the illness is similar. In both cases, the evil presses down on the heart, causing the spirit to feel unsettled, leading to sorrow, while the fire of the heart fails to circulate, resulting in an upward disturbance. When it comes to Taiyin (greater Yin) recovery, the Yin qi rises, inducing internal fluid accumulation that leads to pain in the head, neck, and chest, with especially severe symptoms of dizziness. The commentary points out that internal dampness is rebellious, and cold qi fails to circulate, causing Taiyang to remain above, resulting in this illness.</p>
<p>It is noted that Taiyin governs the springs, and when this is the case, pain in the head and neck occurs with dizziness, which the commentary declares is also a disease of the Foot Taiyang. It is said that Taiyin governs the heavens; thus, there will be head and neck pain with noted dizziness. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; explains that when the evil resides in the kidneys or neck, dizziness may occur at times, all stemming from dampness harming the kidneys and pressuring the qi of Taiyang, which becomes retained above, leading to such results. Furthermore, the &quot;Jin Kui Yao Lue&quot; states that when there is a fluid accumulation below the heart, those who suffer from dizziness are also experiencing an upward surge due to the heart fire not moving properly.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>It is said that a floating pulse at the yuan indicates damage to the kidneys, while a tight pulse at the fu-yang indicates damage to the spleen. When wind and cold clash, consuming grains leads to dizziness; a slow yangming pulse indicates difficulty in achieving fullness after eating. When one feels full, it causes agitation and dizziness. Both of these arise from a deficiency in the spleen and stomach and insufficient yang energy, showing as slow and tight pulses externally, while internally stagnation from dampness causes a slight deficiency of yang to clash with the heat of the stagnation and rise to the head and eyes. By comparing these conditions, dizziness is not caused by a single pathogen. As for the Taiyi, the true primordial qi is nourished by the yang of the stomach, which circulates throughout the body, distributing the six meridians of the three yin and three yang, with the six qi responding to the heavenly yin and yang, running on the surface, which is called the six transformations; the five elements are distributed to the five organs, corresponding to the qi, and the yin and yang of the earth running internally is called the five yang.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>Although the external and internal aspects are distinctly divided, when the channels are harmonized and the internal organs resonate with one another, the external and internal must seem like two yet are one; one and two coexist. This is akin to the natural world having both virtue and transformation, utility and variability, embodied in the form of the body. The text states: success and failure hinge on movement. When movement is tranquil and clear, it nurtures and organizes; when movement is restless and chaotic, it gives rise to harsh diseases. From this perspective, dizziness caused by the energy of a person is surely not limited to what the &quot;Jin Gui&quot; states about dampness from drinks. If the five Yangs and six transformations act wantonly, can the resulting ailments be easily counted? Moreover, any excess or depletion may arise according to the movements of the energies within the channels and organs, which is referred to as the fire of the Yang Qi. The fire of the Yang Qi has five varieties, called the five evils. The transformations of these five evils lead to the onset of diseases. It may happen that kidney water is insufficient, or essence and blood are depleted, unable to control the solitary brightness of the five Yang fires, or that the central energy is weak, unable to resist the rebellious energy below, allowing the fire of dragon and thunder to stir at the summit. Various fires reaching the head may cause pain or, if light, lead to dizziness and vertigo. Such analogies are found within the text.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>In treating various illnesses, one must follow regulations and guidelines, drawing comparisons and analogies to understand the situation deeply, examining both the upper and lower aspects, thus there&#39;s no need to strictly adhere to the classics. Failure to make comparisons shows a lack of understanding. Is this not what it means? </p>
<p>Someone may ask: How should one treat various evils? The answer is: Fire arises from movement; thus, treat according to the cause of that movement: if it is due to real heat, address the heat; if it is caused by external disturbance, address the disturbance. If it manifests as a reversal pressing upward, then treat the disturbance below that causes the reversal. If it arises from a deficiency in Yin, replenish the Yin and restrain the Yang to stabilize it. If it is due to Yang deficiency causing the Qi to float upward, then replenish the Yang and gather the drifting Qi. If the movement is due to the five emotions, stabilize the related organ&#39;s Qi to bring balance. If it arises from stagnation, treat the underlying cause of the stagnation to release and resolve it. If it is caused by deficiency in essence and blood, continuously replenish it, then address its associated factors to mitigate it. If it arises from dominance and conflict, supplement or drain according to the prevailing Qi. If there is a deficiency and weakness in the central Qi, replenish the Earth element to stabilize it.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>When the clear and bright energy of the upper burner is deficient and cannot be activated, one should also supplement the vitality of the middle burner by pushing and lifting it. If the essence and energy from the five zang organs and six fu organs are insufficiently nourished and activated, one should investigate which part is deficient and replenish it. In this way, even without specifically treating the fire, the fire will naturally subside. This principle applies to all diseases arising from fire, not just dizziness. Yan states that external influences from the six extremes and internal injuries from the seven emotions can both lead to dizziness, and one should distinguish these through pulse and signs.</p>
<p>For wind, the pulse is floating with sweats, there is stiffness in the neck and numbness; formulas like Xiaofeng San, Benshi Chuanxiong San, Lingyang Jiao San, Duliang Wan, and Qingzhou Baizhaizi should be used. </p>
<p>For cold, the pulse is tight with no sweat, accompanied by muscle cramps and pulling pain; one can use Jinhua Zhengqi San with added Chuanxiong, Zhizi, and Bai Shao, or even Ginger-Fu Decoction and Jisheng Sanwuqi San. </p>
<p>For summer heat, the pulse is large and weak, with spontaneous sweating and irritability; use Huanglian Xiangru Yin, Shiwei Xiangru Yin, and Xiaoshu Wan. </p>
<p>For dampness, the pulse is fine and heavy, with nausea and drool; use Shenzhu Tang with added Chuanxiong as well as Ming Chushi Tang, Shenshi Tang, and Jisheng Qiongju San. </p>
<p>For wind-heat, use Qianghuo Tang and Gouteng San.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>Cold dampness; use Xiong Dui Zhu Chu Zhuang Tang or Li Zhong Tang, and continue taking Lai Fu Dan, and in severe cases, Yang Zheng Dan. </p>
<p>When emotions are disturbed, causing dizziness and a reversal of qi, use Shi Si You Wan and An Shen Wan together. Additionally, take He Ji Qi Qi Tang to harmonize and intermittently use Ru Xiang Pao Tang. </p>
<p>For those with qi deficiency, this is due to failure of clear qi to rise, or excessive sweating leading to loss of yang. It is necessary to raise yang and tonify qi with herbs such as Huang Qi, Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chuan Xiong, Dang Gui, Gan Ju Hua, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma. As stated in the &quot;Zhi Zhi Fang,&quot; excessive lust leads to the kidney&#39;s inability to draw in qi and return to the source, causing qi to rebel upwards. This dizziness arises from qi deficiency and should be treated with Yi Qi Bu Shen Tang.</p>
<p>For those with blood deficiency, this results from excessive blood loss, leaving yang without support. It is necessary to tonify qi and nourish blood with formulas like Xiong Gui Tang. </p>
<p>For phlegm accumulation in the middle and symptoms of vomiting and dizziness, use Xuan Fu Hua Tang. According to the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; for sudden vomiting, feeling distended below the heart, and having water in the diaphragm leading to dizziness and palpitations, use Ban Xia Jia Fu Ling Tang. If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel, vomiting frothy saliva, and dizziness, this indicates water retention, and Wu Ling San should be used.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>It is also said: When there is a sipped drink in the heart area, the person suffers from dizziness and lightheadedness; the prescription is Ze Xie Bai Zhu Decoction. Use five taels of Ze Xie, two taels of Bai Zhu, and two sheng of water, boil down to one sheng, and divide it into two warm doses. Symptoms of sipped drink include shortness of breath, leaning for support, and a swollen appearance. If phlegm is stuck and not expelled, it should be vomited. </p>
<p>Qing Dai Powder helps treat dizziness effectively by collecting saliva through the nose. For head wind and dizziness, one can use Du Sheng Powder to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one can take cooling and spicy medicines, such as Feng Tong Sheng Powder, adding Ban Xia and similar ingredients. Zhong Jing states: This is caused by phlegm obstructing the chest. </p>
<p>For constipation of both large and small intestines, a mild purgative like He Jian Sou Feng Pill can be used. If the body is weak and cold, it should be warmed. Zhong Jing says: for wind deficiency causing a heavy head and dizziness, where one feels extreme bitterness and cannot taste food, warming the flesh and tonifying the center helps to enhance vital energy; Bai Zhu Fu Zi Decoction is indicated. </p>
<p>For liver convulsion, resembling epilepsy, with unresponsiveness and vomiting, after consciousness returns and the head feels heavy with increased temperature, use a coarse powder of Ma Huang, Gou Teng Pi, Shi Gao, Gan Ge, Ban Xia Qu, Chai Hu, Gan Cao, Zhi Ke, and Gan Ju. Each dose is four qian, using one and a half bowls of water, three slices of ginger, one red date, cook down to eight parts, strain, and take warm.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Baihui Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about the formation of an abscess at the Baihui point. It was said: This is called the &quot;Jade Crown Disease,&quot; initially resembling millet or rice, then suddenly increasing in pain, with significant cold and heat due to the floating of the deficient Yang. It is advisable to take a saline solution with Eight Flavor Pill to direct the fire back to its source, and in severe cases, use Black Lead Pill. If one&#39;s vital energy is originally abundant and the six Yang channels have been afflicted by wind evils, where wind and fire fan each other, causing heat and toxins to rise in the organs, it is recommended to use the Huanglian Xiadotang, along with Yushudan and Shengjindan; additionally, slice Fuzi and place it at the Yongquan point, moxibustion five times to purge the toxins. If there is no pus after seven days, death may occur.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br><strong>Top of the Head Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about a carbuncle forming at the top of the head, it is said: This is caused by wind-heat affecting the sun meridian, also known as Buddha&#39;s top carbuncle, with the acupoint named &quot;Upper Star.&quot; It arises from the imbalance of internal organs&#39; yin and yang, with heat and toxins blocking upward. One should take the Reviving Life Decoction, adding Scutellaria, Lian Qiao, Gardenia, and other cooling herbal agents, along with Zijing Dan, Wujin San, and Duoming Dan to induce sweating. If weak, one should take the Great Supplement Decoction, adding Qianghuo. If it progresses to decay, becoming black and depressed with severe symptoms, along with a rapid pulse and constipation, do not treat.</p>
<p><strong>Forehead Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about a carbuncle forming on the forehead, it is said: This pertains to accumulation of heat in the stomach from the yangming meridian. One should take the Reviving Life Decoction, adding Cimicifuga, Platycodon, and Qianghuo, decocted in water or wine. For strong individuals, administer a gold pill. For the elderly or weak, the Great Supplement Decoction, or ten Xuan San or Huang Qi Nei Tuo San should be administered. If it is delayed and decays, leading to brain tissue exposure, it is fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Great Yang Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about a carbuncle forming at the two great yang areas, it is said: This is called &quot;Brave Carbuncle,&quot; also known as &quot;Brain Growth Carbuncle,&quot; pertaining to the foot yangming stomach meridian, appearing like a lying rat, with simultaneous cold and heat, causing facial swelling. One should take the Reviving Life Decoction, adding Cimicifuga, Platycodon, and Wujin San. If yellow-white pus is obtained by incision after eleven days, one survives; if only thin black blood is present, or if it decays to expose the brain, it is fatal.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br><strong>Hair Follicle Sores</strong></p>
<p>If one inquires about sores on the head resembling grapes, painful for a long time without pus, what should be done? It is called hair follicle sores, with treatment similar to that of scabbed heads. It is essential to examine the sores in detail; if they are depressed in the center and raised around the edges with a color like yellow wax, it is a wide sore.</p>
<p><strong>Red Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ghost&#39;s Legacy&quot; states: Red carbuncles occur on the head, forehead, and in front of the brain, as well as in the palms. If not treated within ten days, it can be fatal. On the seventh day, one can puncture to bleed red blood. If there is no pus by the seventh day, it cannot be treated. Do not create a hole and attack indiscriminately.</p>
<p><strong>Boil and Carbuncle Headache and Dizziness with Detoxifying Powder Modification</strong></p>
<p>Initially, with swollen heads, headaches, and fever, the pathogenic factor is on the surface; add Chuanxiong and Qianghuo. If the external pathogen is on the surface but the vital energy is strong, temporarily use Ren Shen Bai Du San. If there is a headache with chills, it indicates a weak exterior; remove honeysuckle and forsythia, adding ginseng and astragalus. If there is fatigue and headache, or dizziness, it indicates deficiency of the middle energy; remove three ingredients, adding Bupleurum and Cimicifuga; if not effective, temporarily use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Vitex. If there is a headache in the afternoon or dizziness, it indicates deficiency of yin and blood; remove three ingredients, adding cooked rehmannia; if not effective, support with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If there is dream-induced nocturnal emission, headache, or phlegm and shortness of breath, it indicates kidney deficiency unable to contain qi; remove three ingredients and Chuanxiong, supporting with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan; if not effective, it indicates severe deficiency and cold, use Ba Wei Wan.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headaches can be caused by wind, fire, dampness, or phlegm. Additionally, the poisonous effects of wild bayberry can attack from above, resulting in similar symptoms. Moreover, if a woman bathes or combs her hair too early after giving birth while exposed to the wind, this can also lead to headaches, which is referred to as &quot;head wind.&quot; The recommended treatments are Tianma cakes and San Sheng powder. Regardless of whether the condition is new or old, as long as the symptoms are similar, these remedies should work effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>A brain abscess is commonly referred to as &quot;dui kou.&quot; However, there are different causes: it can arise from damp heat accumulation, which is a lighter external cause; or from internal congestion of the five organs, which is a more severe internal cause. Why is this so? The disease of damp heat is influenced by the weather; imbalances between cold and heat, seasonal shifts, and disruptions in yin and yang can make individuals with weak constitutions more susceptible. Although the back of the neck is associated with the governing vessel, it also governs the path of the taiyang cold water energy. Any incursions will cause qi and blood to congeal. Once congealed, swelling will arise, as seen in external infections. The initial symptoms may include headaches, with many appearing at key points. Within three to four days, there are thickening pains, initial fever and chills, dry mouth, red complexion, firm sores that gradually increase in size, intermittent pain, easy development of pus or decay, normal appetite, and typical sitting and standing. Although the external signs may seem fearsome, there are no serious internal symptoms involved, which indicates a yang condition originating externally; thus, many cases may resolve without treatment.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>All formations of the five organs are heavy, and their sources are fivefold: First, the heart governs blood, thus when the heart is disturbed, it causes agitation and unrest, leading to an increase in internal heat that results in swelling when interacting with cold water in the neck. Second, the liver governs the tendons, hence anger injures the liver; the neck is where the three Yang meridians converge. When the liver is injured, the blood vessels are not nourished, and the tendons lose their sustenance, leading to a swelling that causes tightness and pain in the neck, and the patient cannot turn or lean. Before the condition ruptures, the meat appears purplish and dark, hard and swollen; when it does rupture, there is blood and watery discharge, pain without pus. Such signs indicate an injury to the liver&#39;s qi. Third, the spleen governs the muscles, thus overthinking injures the spleen. If spleen qi diminishes, or if rich foods harm the stomach, leading to dryness of the gastric juices, this can cause obstruction in the middle jiao, preventing the flow of qi, which then results in swelling beneath the flesh. The external skin may rot, but the interior remains hard and does not rupture; the mouth is dry, the tongue parched, and there is an aversion to food, leading to a breakdown of transport, with pus discolored and corrupt. Such manifestations indicate injury to the spleen&#39;s qi. Fourth, the lungs govern the skin and hair; hence, grief injures the lungs. When the lungs are injured, the pores are blocked, channels do not communicate, and qi cannot flow smoothly, leading to accumulated swelling.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>The lesions are mostly flat and sunken, with a pale and dull color, skin rotting and greasy fluid flowing, resembling spilled soup. The breath is coarse and short, the face is pale and the nose is dry, producing phlegm and frequent coughing. These symptoms indicate damage to lung qi, which is the fourth category. The kidneys govern the bones and marrow; hence, indulging desires harms the kidneys. When the kidneys are damaged, the true yin energy is compromised. Once the true yin fails, primal fire arises. This fire can rise and fall on its own, either moving or still, scorching the organs, consuming fluids, altering form and sound, with lesions appearing purple-black, the pulse quick and irregular, restlessness and dry mouth, drinking in response to thirst. These symptoms indicate damage to kidney qi, which is the fifth category. </p>
<p>In treating these conditions, one must differentiate between deficiency and excess internally, discern yin and yang externally, align with the natural seasons, and analyze the pathology. If the lesions have not yet formed within seven days, one should open the orifices and induce sweating; if the disease has set in after seven days, treatment should include supplementation. This prevents poison from attacking internally and ensures no transformation of symptoms occurs. If medicinal purging is excessive, original qi may be harmed, making it difficult for toxins to be expelled.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>Additionally, apply cooling medicine; if the qi and blood become frozen, then the muscles can die in abundance, making it difficult for them to decay and corrode. I often treat this condition, especially when boils begin to form but have not yet matured, using a &quot;Pi needle&quot; as described in the &quot;Lingshu&quot; on the nine needles, where the Pi needle is essential for major boils and pus. When inserted at the apex, one can identify the painful area and extract the harmful blood, opening the sore channels. Follow by inserting a toad venom stick straight to the bottom of the sore, apply an external ointment, and internally take the &quot;Wanling Dan&quot; or &quot;Toad Venom Pill&quot; to induce a great sweat and disperse the toxins accumulated inside. The next day, the affected area may be swollen or not, painful or not; continue the insertion and application until the swelling is prominent, the base is raised, and there are cracks with pus around it, at which point treatment can cease. If the insertion is gentle, after nine days, the hardened, unresolvable roots of the disease may be expelled. For severe toxins that cannot drop off suddenly, they may gradually corrode into pus, thus transforming the condition from severe to mild through this effective method. Externally, use the &quot;Yuhong Ointment&quot; to promote growth, and internally take supplements to consolidate the area; the condition will soon heal by itself. For light Yang syndromes, allow for natural decay. There is no need for needle puncture if there is no swelling or pain; even moxibustion does not cause pain. For Yin syndromes, especially, one should promptly act without delay; this is a major method for changing deep conditions to superficial ones.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br><strong>Views on Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When it first appears, it has a high, living root, with a red color and thin skin, causing pain and heat; those that swell without opening are favorable. Once it has developed, whether uneven or symmetrical, the lesion presents rising forms, with pain, fever, and a tendency to rot and produce pus, which is also favorable. When it has burst, with thick pus and red, living flesh, easily bruised and ulcerated, and the swelling gradually decreases with pain subsiding, this is favorable. After it has burst and rotted away, new flesh begins to grow, the wound gradually closes, and coagulated pus produces itching, which is favorable. A small yellow blister appears initially, resembling a bump, not swollen or painful, causing no awareness; this is unfavorable. Once it is formed, not elevated or swollen, neither hot nor painful, with a soft, sunken top and flat, spread base, this is unfavorable. If pus is thin after bursting and the flesh appears purple-black, with the outer skin intact but foul-smelling inside that is not eaten, this is unfavorable. Even if the rotten flesh is gone, if new flesh does not grow, and the wound is enlarged, soft, sunken without vitality, and discolored, this is unfavorable.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Brain Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>At the onset, whether there is a head or not, with great pain or no pain, apply garlic moxibustion and take detoxifying medicine. Once it has developed, if it is hard, hot, and painful, accompanied by dry mouth and constipation, the evil is within and should be expelled; if it is hard, swollen, painless, with fever and aversion to cold, and headache with tense limbs, then it should be released to the exterior and attacked internally. If the swelling is hard and dark purple with no skin necrosis and no internal pus, it is advisable to employ the expulsion method. If the swelling is strong and the head and face are hot, along with dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting, the evil is above, and it should be cleared. If hot, swollen, and painful, bright red, with intermittent pain and internal pus causing swelling, it must be urgently opened. If it is about to rupture but shows slight heat and redness without necrosis, it indicates spleen and stomach deficiency, and should be reinforced. After rupture, if the necrotic tissue does not detach, and the pus is clear and thin while swelling and pain continue, one should greatly nourish qi and blood. If there is much loose stool, short and frequent urination, spontaneous sweating, reduced appetite, and thin rapid pulse with a cool body, warm the interior and strengthen the spleen.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br><strong>On Scalp Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>The scalp carbuncle arises from the hand&#39;s lesser yang triple burner, where the fire moves erratically, compounded by the kidney&#39;s water failing to restrain the fire, or from an external influence of wind-heat. This channel possesses a lot of qi but little blood, and the muscles are thin; hence, when afflicted, it is most difficult to ulcerate. All of this stems from an urgent and violent emotional state, sexual desire, blood deficiency, and the liver&#39;s fire stirring the qi, leading to congestion and formation. </p>
<p>In the initial stages of the carbuncle, there is an interplay of cold and heat, with dizziness, intense pain in the temples, and in severe cases, swelling that connects the ears and eyes to the temples. Treatment should not involve reckless acupuncture; one must differentiate between yin and yang, exterior and interior, as well as between pathogenic and normal conditions to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when the sore is first observed, it tends to be more cold than hot, with dry mouth and thirst, a preference for drinking hot soup, weak and rapid pulse without strength, alongside the condition of hardness with little pain, no ulceration, and no pus, with the root of the sore spreading. These signs indicate a deficiency of righteous qi while the pathogenic qi is strong.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>Treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen, while using detoxification as an aid. Formulas such as Qing Gan Yang Xue Tang and Tuo Li Xiao Du San are examples. Observing the signs, there is more heat and less cold; the head feels dizzy and painful, the mouth is dry and the tongue parched, thirst urges for cold drinks, and there are difficulties with urination. The six pulses are strong and solid, and there are sores that are swollen, painful, and hot, prone to corruption and pus, with roots that are not open, and external swelling. This indicates that the vital energy is strong while the pathogenic energy is weak. Treatment should primarily focus on detoxification, while using strengthening the spleen as an aid, with formulas such as Zhi Zi Qing Gan Tang and Shu Nian Zi Tang as examples. Generally, when the vital energy is strong, it is solid, and when the pathogenic energy is strong, it is weak. One side must prevail, while the other weakens; the pathogenic and vital energies cannot coexist. If one seeks to become weak without sustaining damage, it will naturally lead to weakness. </p>
<p>There are also cases where sores have not yet appeared but initial thirst symptoms occur, which may last for a year or a year and a half, worsening over time before developing into a type of sore known as bin ju. Its form tends to be purplish-black, the sores are often flat and depressed, hard without pus, with poisonous flow around the ears and neck, accompanied by improper tastes and smells, a lackluster complexion, unclear spirit, and an aversion to food; all these indicate that treatment is not viable.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br><strong>Bingju Observation</strong></p>
<p>Initially, there is no dryness in the mouth, cold or heat; the appetite is normal, and movements are typical; those who develop sores are following the proper course. If the sore has developed, swollen at the root, its color vibrant red, and it hurts and oozes pus, this is also following the proper course. Once the pus has erupted and is thick, the color is bright red, swelling has decreased, pain has subsided, there is lightness in the head and neck, and the mouth feels comfortable, this is following the proper course. After rupture, if the necrotic flesh easily decays, new flesh readily grows, the sore heals easily, and appetite is intact, this is following the proper course. </p>
<p>At the onset, if the sore appears like millet, soft on top, not high, with a purple color and scattered roots, accompanied by pain and reduced appetite, this is contrary to the proper course. If the sore&#39;s form is purple-black, soft and sunken without pus, with cold feet and cool body, and thin pulse, this is also contrary. If after rupture, the pus is watery and thin, with foul odor, and rotten flesh does not decay while new flesh does not grow, this is contrary. After rupture, if there is aversion to food, fever, dryness of the mouth, insomnia, and the flesh is thin with rough skin, this is contrary.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods for Scalp Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When it first appears, there is hard swelling and internal heat with dry mouth, and the pulse is rapid and strong, indicating that the pathogen is substantial; it should be purged. When, however, it has advanced, with aversion to cold and strong heat, tightness in the limbs, and a floating pulse, the pathogen is at the surface and should be dispersed. If there is red swelling with pain, this indicates blood stagnation; dispersing blood and clearing the liver is appropriate. If the color is dark and there is diffuse swelling, uplifting yang to support the stomach is advised. </p>
<p>Once it has ruptured, if the hardness and swelling do not subside, with a thin and rapid pulse and evening fever, nourishing yin and strengthening the spleen is necessary. If there are signs of liver and gallbladder fire rising, causing irritability and flushed cheeks, it is advisable to suppress yin and lower the fire. Following rupture, if pus is clear but there is still considerable swelling and pain, with fatigue and poor appetite, nourishing qi and blood and strengthening the spleen and stomach is essential. After rupture, if both qi and blood are deficient, the body feels cool, the pulse is thin, and there is frequent loose stool, it is important to robustly replenish and warm the middle. If healing is delayed, with new flesh growing slowly, the wound edges pale, and continuous pus, strengthening the spleen is necessary.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br><strong>Shan Gong Tou</strong></p>
<p>Shan Gong Tou, commonly known as &quot;Nerve Pig,&quot; is an ailment that occurs from a young age and is inherited from a distant lineage, characterized by toxins accumulated from both paternal and maternal sides. After birth, those affected only have one onset; the swelling is high, and when it bursts, it swells again. This is because it retains the original membranous covering, so even if the poison is expelled, the membrane remains, leading to recurrence. If the swelling is severe and has developed pus, it should be pierced with a needle, and a three-pronged instrument should be inserted into the opening to dissolve the internal membrane for self-healing. There are also cases where there is no pus and the wound does not close; this is likely due to wind attacking the mouth, for which it is advisable to apply a powder of degraded copper and to avoid certain flavors for self-healing.</p>
<p><strong>Tou Nao Jun</strong></p>
<p>Tou Nao Jun occurs on the forehead between the hairline and is often associated with chills and fever, causing a headache that feels like being chopped; it is unbearable. First, use a universal pill to induce sweating to disperse the wind evil, then it should be treated with a clearing agent.</p>
<p><strong>Yu Zhen Jun</strong></p>
<p>Yu Zhen Jun develops in the occipital bone at the back of the head, is firm and difficult to rupture, causing pain that radiates to the shoulders and neck, with nasal congestion and heavy breathing. This is caused by damp heat stagnating in the Taiyang bladder. When it first appears with exterior symptoms, it is appropriate to release the exterior; if there are interior symptoms, then it should be treated for thorough passage. After it ruptures, it should be replenished; if it persists for too long, it should be treated for contraction. This is a fixed method of treatment, and one must not confuse it or carelessly administer remedies, as this could lead to critical situations.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br><strong>White Baldness</strong></p>
<p>White baldness occurs due to shaving; when the pores open, external winds invade and congeal without dispersing, leading to an imbalance of qi and blood, causing the skin and flesh to dry out, resulting in white bald patches. If prolonged, hair will fall out, as the roots lack nourishment, resembling smooth, shiny bald spots that do not itch. If the internal blood has been restored, using ginger to moisten the skin with ointment regularly will gradually promote hair growth. If the bald patches are dry and itchy, there must be internal parasites; it is advisable to apply wheat powder. When the parasites die and the wind disperses, recovery is possible. Afterward, avoid windy products that stimulate hair.</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Treating Excess Damp Heat in the Head</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; the treatment of excess damp in the upper jiao relates to the notion in the &quot;Neijing&quot; that excessive damp leads to heat, and distinguishes between light and heavy conditions. In light cases, there is merely fever, reddened face, shortness of breath, head pain, nasal congestion, and restlessness, indicating the pathogen is in the upper jiao with no other internal illness. One should use internal medicines via the nose to remove the damp heat causing yellow fluid. As the nasal passages serve as the gateway to the brain, using methods that act through the nose is the most effective approach. In heavy cases, there is fever with cold feet, occasional hot head and reddened face, all clear signs of excess damp turning into heat. The excess damp upwards leads to heat, causing heat in the head, redness of the face, and red eyes. The abundance of damp heat obstructs yang qi upwards, preventing it from descending to the yin, resulting in cold feet. The &quot;Neijing&quot; indeed contains methods for directing what is above to go below; as the pathogen ascends from below, it must be driven downwards, which is a certain principle.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>For those with mild symptoms, there are no other ailments in the interior, but they experience yellow fluid from the mouth, which flows down through the nasal passages. In contrast, those with severe internal issues and dangerous symptoms must expel the yellow fluid through the openings at the front and back. This should be understood. In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; under this text, there are an additional twenty-four characters that serve as a warning against inducing sweating. Initially, this was not regarded as a warning, which also requires understanding. However, the difficulty of using purgatives lies in not recognizing the reasons against sweating; thus, the authority to use purgatives is lost. When Zhongjing observed symptoms such as head shaking, mouth shutting, and a rigid back, it indicated a near loss of Yang; if sweating were to be induced at this point, the already weak exterior Yang would worsen, and the chills would become severe. If sweating has already been induced, the pulse feels like a snake, indicating that true Yang is lost, which could lead to death in a moment. Therefore, it is inferred that if excessive dampness leads to severe heat, purgatives are not advisable for recovery. Moreover, if purgatives are used, they must be combined with warming herbs, so that dampness can be expelled without losing Yang along with it. This is not unsubstantiated. Zhongjing emphasizes in this chapter that if purgatives are used and sweat appears on the forehead, slight panting, and small urination occurs, it is a sure sign of death. Is this not a significant warning against losing Yang due to purging?<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>All winds that cause dizziness belong to the liver. If wood predominates, the limbs become stiff and lead to dizziness; if the wind moves upwards, it causes dizziness. The spleen, being deficient, reflects the condition of the liver. If wood weakens, then blood cannot nourish the tendons, leading to dizziness; if Qi is deficient above, it also results in dizziness, and evil Qi from metal invades wood, causing liver deficiency.</p>
<p>If one mistakenly sweats and experiences palpitations with dizziness, and their body shakes without remedy, the formula True Warrior Soup can be used as a treatment. Although sweat may emerge, if the heat does not recede, then the evil has not yet been expelled while the vital essence is greatly harmed. Moreover, internal deficiency leads to palpitations, upward deficiency results in dizziness, and channel deficiency causes tremors, with the body shaking, symbolizing the loss of Yang. Therefore, the practice of True Warrior is employed to guard and stabilize.</p>
<p>In cases of lesser Yin disease where diarrhea ceases but dizziness continues, and symptoms repeatedly arise, the prognosis is dire. This is because if Yang recovers and diarrhea stops, it signifies life; however, if cessation of diarrhea is accompanied by further dizziness, it indicates that Yin has already been lost. Hence, Yang lacks support and floats upwards, leading to a disordered spirit and Qi, causing the symptoms to recur.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>Darkness on the Forehead</p>
<p>Women laboring excessively develop dark spots on their foreheads, which suggests that the body&#39;s yellowness is accompanied by this darkness. Black represents the subtle and obscure color of the north, added to the brightness of the south, indicating that there must first be a mixture of stomach heat and spleen coldness that flows downward into the kidneys. This, combined with women&#39;s excessive labor, leads to its development; its origins are not established in a single day. The &quot;Zhou Hou&quot; text states that this is caused by interfacing with water, which may sometimes be observed. However, when fire consumes fuel, the color of the forehead turns dark; even if one does not come into contact with water, can one escape this fate? Thus, the turbid energy in the spleen descends into the kidneys, and the colors of water and earth manifest mutually, showing merely a black stagnation within the yellow. If the fire rising from the water combines with the royal fire of the heart, its momentum can scorch the fields, and the color of the smoke and flames first penetrates the forehead, leading to even slight sweating, which follows the fire outward, causing the heart&#39;s essence to be lost externally.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br><strong>Jingyue&#39;s Complete Works</strong> (Ming Dynasty, by Zhang Jieben)</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>When diagnosing headaches, one should first assess their duration, then distinguish between external and internal causes. Temporary headaches are usually due to external邪气 (evil influences); chronic headaches are often associated with the decline of the body&#39;s essential energy (元气). For temporary illnesses, if there is an external邪, it is caused by wind and cold invading the channels, and treatment should focus on dispersing the邪, while avoiding methods that clear and descend. If there is an internal邪, it relates to the fire of the three Yang channels being intense within, and treatment should aim to clear and descend, avoiding methods that ascend and disperse. This is the method for treating邪.</p>
<p>For chronic illnesses, the headache may alternatively worsen or improve. It may arise from slight sensations due to a deficiency in the exterior, mild heat from a predominance of Yang, or diminished fluids below allowing虚火 (false fire) to rise, or from a deficiency of Yang above resulting in the dominance of Yin cold. Therefore, for temporary illnesses, one should focus on the邪气; for chronic illnesses, emphasis should be on the元气. This is the foundational principle.</p>
<p>However, there may also be cases of temporary illnesses that are虚 (deficient) or chronic ones that are实 (excess). These should be treated in consideration of the pulse and symptoms, rather than adhering rigidly to a single approach.</p>
<p>Headaches can be further distinguished by the respective channels. When diagnosing headaches caused by external factors, one should observe the three Yang channels and the Jueyin channel, as the three Yang脉 (meridians) all run to the head, and the Jueyin channel also converges at the crown. Thus, in Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; it is indicated that only the three Yang channels have headaches, while the Taiyin and Shaoyin channels do not.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>Regarding the methods of diagnosis, even though the head and brain can experience pain, regardless of whether the three Yang channels are involved, it is important to differentiate them. The Taiyang is located at the back, the Yangming at the front, and the Shaoyang at the side; each has its own governing element and should be distinguished in terms of external pathogenic factors. As for internal injuries causing headaches, one should not be constrained by the three Yang channels. As mentioned in the foundational text, when there is deficiency below and excess above, it pertains to the Lesser Yin and Greater Yang; the discussion in the chapter on syncope states that both the six channels in the legs and the lesser Yin and lesser Yang in the arms can be involved. The Treatise on Odd Diseases states: &quot;The brain is Yin. The marrow is the filling of the bones.&quot; Therefore, any pain in the brain could not be other than a disease of the Lesser Yin. This distinction between internal and external should not be overlooked. </p>
<p>For externally contracted headaches, observable exterior signs must be noted, such as chills and fever, a tight and rapid pulse, a runny nose, coughing, soreness in the back, or a stiff neck that prevents turning; all of these indicate the presence of cold evil in the channels. By dispersing the cold evil, the pain will naturally subside. Herbs such as Chuanxiong, Xixin, Vitex, and Chaihu are particularly suitable. If the cold is severe, one should use Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Sheng Jiang, Cong Bai, Zi Su, and Bai Zhi, adjusting the dosage according to the patient&#39;s condition.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>Headaches caused by fire evil, although each meridian has its own fire symptoms, are most pronounced in the Yangming, primarily due to the strong stomach fire that ascends to the head and directly affects the head region, resulting in severe pain, a strong pulse, and numerous internal heat signs. If there is throbbing pain in the head without exterior evil, it is certainly fire evil. To treat the fire of Yangming, there is nothing better than Bai Hu Tang, supplemented with Ze Xie, Mu Tong, Sheng Di, and Mai Dong to suppress its high momentum, as this provides the quickest effect. </p>
<p>As for fire in other meridians, one may choose remedies like Shao Yao, Tian Hua Fen, Qin, Lian, Zhi, Yao, Long Dan, and Zhi Zi. However, in treating fire, it is not advisable to use dispersing methods. This is because exterior evil fire can be dispersed, but internal stagnated fire will flare up if allowed to rise, which is to be avoided. </p>
<p>Yin deficiency headaches are also a type related to blood deficiency and are often found in chronic illnesses. The symptoms are usually due to a depletion of water, making it easy for虚火 (xu huo, &quot;false fire&quot;) to arise, leading to pain coupled with heat and other internal heat symptoms. The treatment should primarily focus on tonifying water, employing formulas like Zhi Yin Ba Wei Jian, Jian Jian Yi Yin Jian, or Yu Nu Jian. For mild fire, prescriptions such as Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, Si Wu Tang, San Yin Jian, or Zuo Gui Yin are suitable.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>Yin deficiency headache corresponds to qi deficiency and can occur in those with a long-standing illness. Symptoms typically include a feeling of heaviness and discomfort, sensitivity to light, aversion to cold, fatigue, and a lack of appetite. The pulse is often weak and fine, and there is a heavy sensation in the head. Pain is exacerbated by cold and dampness, indicating a predominance of yin over yang. Treatment should focus on tonifying yang, using formulas such as Li Yin Decoction, Middle Strength Decoction, Complete Tonifying Decoction, and Qi Tonifying Decoction as options. Alternatively, Wufu Drink or Five Gentlemen Decoction can be used, combined with Chuanxiong, Xixin, and Viburnum, to help elevate yang qi, which is among the best treatments.</p>
<p>Phlegm obstruction headache is mentioned in various classical texts, yet according to my analysis, there must be other accompanying causes. Headache combined with phlegm can occur, but it isn’t necessarily caused by phlegm. Therefore, if phlegm is present, it must be treated as such, observing symptoms like nausea, a sensation of fullness in the chest, and cough with copious phlegm. In these cases, Erchen Decoction, Liu&#39;an Decoction, Harmonizing Stomach Drink, and Pingwei Powder, along with Chuanxiong, Xixin, and Viburnum, should be used primarily. If there is phlegm combined with heat, Qingge Decoction is recommended, or alternatively, Erchen Decoction or Liu&#39;an Decoction with Huangqin and Tianhuafen. If the heat is severe, adding gypsum is also acceptable. For headaches caused by phlegm combined with deficiency, Jinshui Liu Jun Decoction or Liu Junzi Decoction with Chuanxiong and Xixin should be used judiciously.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness can be classified into several causes; those who are deficient account for eight or nine out of ten cases, while those affected by both heat and phlegm represent only one or two. The reasons for this condition include excessive fatigue, irregular eating and drinking times, vomiting that injures the upper organs, diarrhea affecting the lower organs, excessive sweating that depletes energy, disturbances of the mind from fright, persistent worry, mental strain from being insulted or assaulted, and extreme grief or pain manifesting in loud cries; all of these injuries affect the vital essence of yang. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are cases of vomiting blood, nosebleeds, or bloody stools, as well as infections with severe pus, serious injuries from sharp objects causing blood loss, excessive sexual indulgence in men leading to energy depleting with semen, and women experiencing bleeding after childbirth or during abnormal menstruation; these injuries impact the yin that supports yang. </p>
<p>Additionally, excessive drunkenness that combines dampness and heat affects the yin. Extreme anger can drive up the energy of the wood element, causing distress to the qi. Mucus improperly retained in the body, affecting digestion, indicates weakness of the spleen, representing an excess in some areas coupled with a deficiency in others. </p>
<p>Finally, elderly individuals with weakened essence and accumulated fatigue may suddenly suffer insomnia or dizziness, which results from the dual deficiency of the nutritive and defensive energy. From this analysis, one can distinguish between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>Just as the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states, the essence is about emptiness, yet why do later scholars often indulge in their own conjectures? Do their understandings of conditions and the underlying principles of illness truly align? If we follow this guidance, can later students avoid errors? Thus, I have extracted the main points as follows.</p>
<p>The discussion by Hejian on dizziness emphasizes a key statement: all dizziness belongs to the liver wood. This is caused by the wind&#39;s activity. The so-called severe wind leading to dizziness in the head and eyes arises when wood is abundant and metal is weak, unable to restrain wood. Consequently, wood generates fire, and both wind and fire relate to yang, which is inherently active. When these two forms of activity clash, they lead to rotation. Thus, fire is fundamentally active; when flames encounter wind, they naturally swirl. This explains the meaning of wind and wood, which seems plausible.</p>
<p>However, it is not recognized that the essence of the &quot;Key Treatise&quot; discusses the principles related to the movement of qi and organ energy, not solely the condition of dizziness. Only in discussions like the &quot;Oral Inquiry,&quot; &quot;Guarding Qi,&quot; &quot;Decisive Qi,&quot; &quot;Meridian,&quot; and &quot;Sea Treatise&quot; can we find the most relevant arguments. How can Hejian reference none of these, speaking only of wind and fire to support his claim about dizziness? Isn’t this a mistake?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Danxi&#39;s discussion on dizziness states: phlegm is above, and fire is below; the fire rises and moves the phlegm. This indicates that the presence of phlegm is significant; without phlegm, dizziness cannot occur. Even if wind is involved, there must also be phlegm. Those with involved qi deficiency should primarily address phlegm, along with using herbs to tonify qi and reduce fire.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>If we discuss this argument, then all cases of dizziness must pertain to phlegm syndrome. Why do Xuan and Qi claim it does not involve phlegm and only state that it is due to insufficient upper Qi, causing suffering in the head and dizziness in the eyes? They say that if there is upper deficiency, there is dizziness; if the governor vessel is deficient, the head feels heavy and sways; if the sea of marrow is insufficient, there is turning of the brain and tinnitus leading to dizziness. Are all these not related to phlegm syndrome? Moreover, if the various conditions I listed in the previous chapter are all due to dizziness, can they all be categorized as phlegm syndrome as well? Therefore, Danxi states that without phlegm, dizziness cannot occur, so treatment of phlegm should be prioritized, while also using other medications. I, on the other hand, say that without deficiency, dizziness cannot occur, so treatment of deficiency should be the main focus, while also considering associated signs. Who is correct and who is wrong, I cannot say for certain; I will wait for the wise to clarify. Headache, in this case, is a condition of excessive presence.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The condition of dizziness is attributed to an upper deficiency syndrome. Therefore, the Inner Canon clearly stipulates: headache at the crown indicates excess above and deficiency below. It also states that excess above and deficiency below leads to vertex headache. This is because the pathogenic qi resides above, causing the pain, hence it is termed excess above. In contrast, when discussing dizziness, it mentions that there is insufficient qi above. It also states that an upper deficiency leads to dizziness; it does not speak of excess above. However, subsequent scholars, such as Yan Yonghe and Yang Renzhai, have posited interpretations that include phlegm rising and obstructing the flow of qi, suggesting fatigue from overexertion resulting in upper excess but lower deficiency, and that the kidneys are unable to receive qi, causing qi to rise up disorderly. Zhu Danxi similarly stated there is phlegm above and fire below. All these interpretations speak to the notion of excess above. How could they contradict the Inner Canon so? Alas! This represents the failure of later generations to understand the text.</p>
<p>Regarding dizziness, it can manifest as a heavy head, blackened vision, or a sensation of the brain spinning uncontrollably. The reasoning behind these symptoms simply points to the heavy head being seen as excess above, without realizing that the head is not heavier than in previous times, but rather that one cannot endure its weight more than before. The inability to withstand the burden indicates a deficiency in yang; it is not truly an excess above. What then accounts for the failure of qi to return to its source or for the chaotic ascent of qi? Excess above should subside and be restrained, while deficiency above should not be subjected to further depletion of vitality. This distinction between excess and deficiency is vital and misunderstanding it can lead to harm. </p>
<p>In examining dizziness, whether minor or significant, one can discern the true nature of excess and deficiency.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>How can it be explained? Nowadays, people with weak constitutions, regardless of age, whether young or old, after fatigue or indulging in wine and pleasure, often experience ringing in the ears like a bell, or dizziness with blurred vision, which quickly subsides; this is a common occurrence. Beyond middle age, one often observes symptoms such as fainting and collapse, which are also quite common. However, when these symptoms appear and disappear suddenly, people generally call it &quot;head disturbance with blurred vision&quot;; if someone collapses and does not regain consciousness, it is often attributed to &quot;stroke or phlegm.&quot; They fail to realize that the temporary cessation is due to the qi and blood not being completely depleted, hence it appears and disappears quickly, which is a mild form of stroke; but a severe collapse indicates a fundamental deficiency, resulting in sudden illness that is hard to recover from, which is a serious form of dizziness. Moreover, such symptoms are typically seen in those beyond middle age, and compared to the young, the severity is even more evident. Observing this, one can discern whether it is truly wind or not, whether it is phlegm or not, and understand the dynamics of deficiency and excess. Why do people nowadays not recognize the underlying mechanisms of these ailments, and merely see dizziness and collapse without speaking of them, attributing it all to wind and phlegm without considering that it may be dissipative or dispersive? I fear that the slightest decline in qi may be subjected to further burdens. It is deeply lamentable.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>Dizziness, though related to an upper deficiency, cannot be entirely separated from the lower. The upper deficiency refers to the ultimate yang weakness; the lower deficiency pertains to the yang weakness within yin. For ultimate yang weakness, one should treat the qi, using formulas like the Four Gentlemen Decoction, the Five Gentlemen Brew, the Gui Pi Decoction, or the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. In cases with accompanying vomiting, the Sheng Jiang Decoction with an increase in ginseng and similar ingredients should be applied.</p>
<p>For the yang weakness within yin, one should supplement the essence, using formulas like the Five Blessings Drink, the Seven Blessings Drink, the Left Return Drink, the Right Return Drink, or the Four Substance Decoction. It is essential to understand that depleting the lower will inevitably harm the upper, and nourishing the sprouts must involve watering the roots. Therefore, in treating upper deficiency, it is still crucial to also supplement qi and blood, using formulas like the Major Tonifying Yuan Decoction, the Ten Perfect Tonifying Soup, and various formulas for replenishing yin and yang, all should be used judiciously.</p>
<p>For cases of dizziness, any underlying sources of illness as mentioned in the previous discussion should be treated according to their specific symptoms.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>If there is fire, one should also clear the fire; if there is phlegm, one should clear the phlegm; if there is qi, one should regulate the qi. This depends on the situation and must adapt accordingly. However, it is always important to prioritize treating deficiency and complement this with addressing other issues.</p>
<p>In the ancient methods for treating dizziness and vertigo, careful observation is necessary. Danxi stated that for those with damp phlegm, the Erchen decoction should be used, and for fire, it should be combined with wine and Huangqin. Those with both qi deficiency and fire require first treating the phlegm while using qi-regulating herbs to reduce fire, such as the Dongyuan Banxia Baizhu Tianma decoction.</p>
<p>For dizziness that cannot be resisted, prepare a powder of Dahuang stir-fried in wine and take it with tea infusion. When fire stirs phlegm, use Erchen decoction and add Huangqin, Cangzhu, and Qianghuo to dispel wind and eliminate dampness. </p>
<p>It is noted that if there is early morning dizziness that stabilizes shortly and occurs as a daily routine, one should use Zhengyuan powder and Xiaheixidan. </p>
<p>For food injury causing dizziness, add Chuanxiong to the Shen Zhuo decoction, named Chushi decoction. Those with phlegm should use Qingzhou Baowanzi.</p>
<p>I believe the ancient method for treating dizziness, such as the Banxia Baizhu Tianma decoction, treats spleen phlegm. The Erchen decoction with Huangqin treats heat phlegm. The Qingzhou Baowan treats wind phlegm and cold phlegm. The Shen Zhuo decoction treats kidney phlegm. Additionally, the use of Dahuang powder for dizziness is suitable only for phlegm-fire obstruction. The heavy fall from Heixidan is suitable only when qi is abundant above. However, one should be cautious, as cases of dizziness may involve substantial phlegm and fire, but are not solely due to excessive conditions above. It is essential to carefully assess whether these ancient formulas are appropriate for use.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br><strong>Secret Manuscript of the Stone Chamber: Treatment for Headaches</strong></p>
<p>The common method of treatment is to address the condition according to established practices. For example, if a person suffers from a headache, one should use the typical treatments for headaches. There is no need to treat it by addressing the feet, even if there are cases where treating the feet may lead to relief; however, one must generally use established methods first before attempting alternative treatments. Therefore, when a headache arises, take five qian of Chuanxiong, one qian each of Baizhi, Manjingzi, Licorice, Banxia, and Xixin, and the ailment will be dispelled instantly.</p>
<p>For upper treatments, which address issues with the upper burner, such as headaches caused by wind invading the Taiyang channel, use one qian each of Chuanxiong, Xixin, Baizhi, Chaihu, Banxia, and Licorice, along with three qian of Shaoyao. Although wind affects the Taiyang, the treatment need not entirely focus on it; the key is to clear the evil. Thus, Baizhi, Chuanxiong, and Xixin are used to disperse the wind, while Baishao, Licorice, and Chaihu help clear the fire from the liver and gallbladder, as these channels connect to the head. Additionally, Banxia is included to eliminate phlegm, and Licorice harmonizes the ingredients together to achieve efficacy. </p>
<p>As another remedy for headaches, use one liang of Chuanxiong and two qian of Manjingzi, decoct in water and drink to achieve immediate relief.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>Chuanxiong nourishes the blood, and Manjingzi dispels wind. For those who treat ailments, such as headaches, there is no need to resort to drastic measures. For headache relief, use one liter of yellow wine, add one tael of Xixin and one tael of Bai Zhi, and brew it to intoxication for a cure. </p>
<p>These treatment methods are unknown to most, and few dare to use them; hence I provide guidance today. When headaches persist for years, the evil is deeply rooted in the brain. How can a few cents&#39; worth of powdered medicine reach the crown and penetrate into the brain? You must use ample Xixin, Chuanxiong, and Bai Zhi to disperse it effectively. Some may fear that using too many herbs will deplete genuine qi, worried that the headache won&#39;t go away before the genuine qi runs out. But little do they know, the wind evil resides in the head; to successfully eradicate it, one must use ample wind-dispelling herbs. If there is illness, one must bear it; what is there to fear? A single bout of intoxication can cure it. This remedy is trustworthy and not to be doubted. </p>
<p>However, after recovery, it is essential to take five qian each of Shudi, Shaoyao, and Danggui, one qian of Chuanxiong, and three qian each of Shanzhuyu and Maidong, decocted in water and taken in four doses for optimal effect. When someone suffers from a headache, they often believe it to be wind in the head, not recognizing it could also be due to insufficient kidney water, allowing evil fire to surge into the brain, causing what seems like a headache but is not truly one.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>Treating only the wind will exacerbate the pain. The method should primarily strengthen the kidney water, and the headache will naturally resolve. The formula includes one tael each of cooked rehmannia and astragalus, four qian of cornelian cherry, two qian each of northen five-flavor fruit and ophiopogon, and three qian each of radix scrophulariae, ligusticum, angelica, and yam; just two doses will cure it. This formula is remarkable because it treats the kidney while not directly addressing the wind, and even more so because it simultaneously treats the liver. If the liver wood is unbalanced, then the lung metal loses its transformative power, resulting in diminished kidney water. Now, by nourishing both the liver and the kidney, they support each other, naturally clearing the head and eyes. Moreover, with the addition of ophiopogon and five-flavor fruit to nourish the lung metal&#39;s clarity and purging function, the throat is thus soothed.</p>
<p>For headaches with a divine formula, use one tael each of ligusticum and glehnia, two qian of vine-growing plant, and five qian of asarum, with two bowls of water. Boil until two-thirds remains, add half a bowl of yellow wine, mix well, and take each morning; one dose will ensure the pain never returns. This formula is exceptional due to the inclusion of glehnia, which nourishes the yin and typically does not enter the brain. However, when added to ligusticum, and combined with vine-growing plant and asarum, it directly targets the crown of the head. Since glehnia cannot descend, it must cooperate with the others to enter the brain. Head pain is due to wind caused by the deficiency of yin in the brain, resulting in it being trapped and unable to leave.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>Now, if you apply this remedy to the brain, the wind will not be able to remain, and the pain in the brain will heal on its own, and the headache will also be relieved. This method not only treats headaches but also addresses brain pain, with no exception of efficacy. </p>
<p>For headache symptoms, simply crush one seed of castor bean, mix it with a little jujube flesh, and make it into a ball the size of a yellow bean. Wrap it in fine silk and insert it into the nostril. In a short while, clear mucus will flow out; then remove the ball, and do not leave it inside for long. The headache will then be cured and will never recur. However, if left too long, it will inevitably cause the brain&#39;s essence to flow out, leading to an incurable condition. Remember, remember!</p>
<p>If a person has a headache, the method should be to use a light and clear mouth for slight dispersion, which will be effective. For instance, the method of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is such. However, many are unaware of the principle of lightness and heaviness in this decoction. I will further refine it to be a lasting model. The ingredients are: Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, and Gan Cao, each one penny, and Ren Shen five fen, for this is the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. I suggest adding another five fen of Ren Shen and two qian of Fu Ling for even more miraculous effects, as sufficient Qi makes it easier for evils to exit and sweat to be produced. </p>
<p>Many see the use of ginseng and lose color, not only doctors dare not use it, but also patients do not dare to take it. This misunderstanding has become a widespread issue. How can I announce to all physicians to carefully examine the source of ailments and use it appropriately!<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment for Head Pain</h3>
<p>For head pain, use one liter of yellow wine, three taels of white spoon (a type of herb), three qian each of magnolia flower and platycodon, five qian each of (wood) plum pits, dwarf lilyturf, and bupleurum, one qian of licorice, and three bowls of water. Prepare it as a decoction, then add the yellow wine and drink it; one bout of drunkenness will cure it. If the dosage is correct, drink again with wine, ensuring it leads to drunkenness.</p>
<p>Head pain arises from wind entering the gallbladder meridian. Since the gallbladder is connected to the brain, that is why there is head pain. Some believe that using too much bupleurum is overly dispersive, not realizing that white peony can harmonize it, preventing the Qi from dispersing while still allowing the dispelling of pathogens. Magnolia flower and (wood) plum pits are excellent for the gallbladder, while platycodon and licorice are wonderful medicines for the lungs. How can gallbladder issues also treat the lungs? It is not understood that the nose connects to the brain; when the brain is hot, it must lead to a flow of clear fluids, which if prolonged, will lead to nasal congestion. By treating the lungs simultaneously, the lung Qi becomes clear and orderly, allowing the excess energy of the gallbladder to stabilize, thus preventing clear fluids from flowing downward. This is the marvelous efficacy of this prescription.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Head and Face</strong></p>
<p>Some individuals suddenly experience swelling of the head and face as large as a bucket, seeing others as small as three inches. They lose their appetite and groan as if in sleep. This is phlegm; use Ground Melon Seed Powder to expel it, and the swelling of the head and eyes will diminish. After expelling it, they will see others as before. Later, use three qian each of ginseng, white atractylodes, poria, and pinellia, with one qian of licorice and five fen of dried tangerine peel, decocted in water and taken as medicine; two doses will suffice for a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Scabby Head Sores</strong></p>
<p>There is a treatment for scabby heads using dozens of snails. Wash the scabby head with them, and after two applications, it will surely heal; this is also a miraculous remedy. Three bowls of water are sufficient to boil thirty snails.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br><strong>Head and Horn Sores</strong></p>
<p>If a person has sores on the head and horns, on that day the head feels heavy like a mountain; on the second day, it will turn blue and purple; by the third day, if the blue spreads to the body, death will occur. This is caused by toxic gas attacking the heart. This illness is often caused by the excessive consumption of spring medicines. Indeed, preparations like spring medicines are merely pills that, when taken, strengthen yang energy and increase vitality. Without using hot medicines, how can this arise? The most potent hot medicines in the world are no other than Aconite and Alpinia Galanga. Both are extremely toxic, and Alpinia Galanga must be calcined before entering a formula, as it is extremely drying, naturally depleting bodily fluids. Moreover, those who excessively indulge to please women will have their sinews, bones, and blood all stirred up. After prolonged indulgence, it will surely lead to significant depletion of essence; as fluids diminish, fire energy becomes more intense. Over time, such indulgence inevitably results in great toxicity, causing fire energy to rise, which is why it frequently manifests in the head and solar region. </p>
<p>At the onset, if the head feels heavy like a mountain, it indicates this serious condition. There is no time to hesitate; quickly take one pound of honeysuckle and boil it into a decoction, drinking dozens of bowls, which can partially alleviate the poison and preserve life. Yet one cannot escape the ulceration of the sores. Then, use three taels each of honeysuckle and Scrophularia, two taels of Angelica, and one tael of raw licorice to make a decoction, taking one dose per day for seven days, after which the sores will begin to converge and heal. This kind of illness is quite prevalent in the world, yet people are most unwilling to refrain from consuming spring medicines—how lamentable!<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Complete Record of Medical Volume 125</strong></p>

<p>Mix and add refined honey to knead into pills the size of phoenix seeds. Whether taken on an empty stomach or before noon, swallow with hot white soup or light salt soup for over a hundred pills.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a><br><strong>Li Yin Decoction</strong>: This is a modified formula of the Li Zhong Tang. Whenever there is a deficiency in the spleen and kidneys leading to symptoms such as dizziness and circulatory issues, if it is suitable for a strong, dry treatment, one should use formulas similar to Li Zhong’s Six Jun herbs; if it requires warmth and moisture, one should use formulas similar to Li Yin Da Ying. To understand how to properly bolster, one must first observe this.</p>
<p>This formula is effective in treating true yin deficiency, fullness and distention, nausea and vomiting, phlegm and water retention, vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain, and symptoms of women such as delayed menstruation and blood stasis.</p>
<p>Moreover, for those with insufficient true yin, or those who are generally overworked and fatigued, and suddenly catch a cold evil that cannot be dispelled, or experience fever, body aches, facial redness and a scorched tongue, or feel thirsty yet do not desire hot drinks, or have a sensitivity to cold in the back, heart, and limbs, while the pulse appears weak—these are all indications of false heat. If one were to attack with cold and cool treatments, it would be fatal. One should promptly use this formula, making adjustments thereafter to warm and tonify the yin, disperse the exterior evil, taking several doses to gradually nourish the yin qi; thus, the sweat will emerge from the yin, and the cold evil will disperse on its own. This is essential for timely application, with divine effects that cannot be fully described.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooked Rehmannia, 3, 5, or 7 qian (about 9-21 grams) or 1-2 liang (about 30-60 grams)</li>
<li>Angelica sinensis, 2-3 qian (about 6-9 grams) or 5-7 qian (about 15-21 grams)</li>
<li>Dry ginger, roasted until yellow, 1-2-3 qian (about 3-9 grams)</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice, 1-2 qian (about 3-6 grams)</li>
<li>Water, 2 zhong (about 400 ml), decocted to 7-8 portions, taken hot. Optionally, add cinnamon 1-2 qian (about 3-6 grams).</li>
</ul>
<p>If this formula increases with Aconite, it is then called Aconite Li Yin Decoction; if it adds Ginseng, it is referred to as Six Flavor Regain Yang Drink, treating conditions of declining Ming Men fire and lack of yang in the yin.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a><br>If one is first exposed to the cold wind and feels symptoms without deep invasion of pathogens, such as fever and body aches, with a pulse that is rapid but not forceful, and there are no signs of internal fire, those who are generally deficient should take this decoction. Add one and a half or two qian of Chaihu, and take one or two doses; its effect is remarkable. If cold has condensed and yin is abundant, and the pathogen is difficult to resolve, one must certainly add one or two qian of Mahuang, and use it confidently; or it may be taken without Chaihu, lest it be too purging. This is the first formula to warm and disperse the cold pathogen, known only to Zhongjing. His warming and dispersing methods primarily use Mahuang and Guizhi decoctions. Others use variations with the Li Yin decoction or the Da Wen Zhong drink for adjustments. Although these target different aspects—one focusing on yang and the other on yin—their effects are interconnected, acting outwardly and inwardly, and use of warmth is fundamental. Students should adjust according to the needs at hand.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a><br>When Yin predominates and there is an external invasion of cold pathogens, with a fine pulse that disdains the cold, or when there is a fear of cold in the back, this indicates a condition of Taiyang and Shaoyin. One should add 1-2 qian of xiaoyao (Asarum), and in severe cases, add 1-2 qian of fuzi (Aconite) as a true divine remedy. Alternatively, one may also add chaihu (Bupleurum) to assist. If there is Yin deficiency with excess heat, characterized by internal heat, it is inappropriate to use warming remedies. If both Qi and blood are deficient and the pathogen cannot be dispelled, one should avoid ginger and cinnamon and instead adjust the two ingredients alone, or simply add ginseng. </p>
<p>If treating a deficiency of both the spleen and limbs, with water accumulation leading to phlegm, causing either vomiting or bloating, one should add 1.5 qian of fuling (Poria) to the previous formula, or add 0.5 qian of baijieshi (White mustard seed) to promote its movement. </p>
<p>For persistent diarrhea or kidney issues, use a small amount of danggui (Angelica), or remove it entirely, adding ingredients such as shanyao (Chinese yam), biandong (Hyacinth bean), wuzhuyu (Evodia), poguzhi (Plantago), roudoukou (Nutmeg), and fuzi (Aconite). If there is pain in the waist and abdomen, add duzhong (Eucommia) and gouqi (Wolfberry). If there is abdominal bloating and pain, add chenpi (Aged tangerine peel), muxiang (Aucklandia), and sharen (Cardamom).<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a><br><strong>Five Gentlemen Decoction</strong>: For treating weakness and coldness of the spleen and stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, heavy head and dizziness combined with dampness.

Excluding Betel Nut and Mu Xiang, all should be ground into a fine powder. Each dose is 1 liang, with 1.5 sheng of water, decocted to 1 sheng. Take 1-2 doses initially; then for the next doses, add 1 qian of Da Huang, then increase by 1 qian each time until it is sufficiently relieved. If there is a heat syndrome, only take Huanglian Decoction; if there is constipation, add Da Huang; if there is no heat syndrome, slightly decoct and take the internal powder repeatedly. If there is no heat and regular bowel movements, stop taking the repeated decoction; if there is slight heat, take Huanglian Decoction; if constipated, add Da Huang. This way, both internal and external will be unblocked, the Ying and Wei will be harmonized, and the meridians will not be obstructed.<a id="trans-276p" href="#orig-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a><br>Internal Decoction for Reinfusion Powder treats external brain abscesses and swellings. The root causes are not deep, and the symptoms are on the surface, with the pulse often floating, and pain in the skin and flesh. When pathogenic energy is strong, it will inevitably invade internally, so urgent internal reinfusion is needed to save the interior.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Yellow Qi, Peony, Baical Skullcap, White Atractylodes (stir-fried), Poria, Ginseng, Licorice, Cinnamon, Earth Bone Skin, Stephania, and Angelica, each 1 tael; and 2 taels of Siler. </p>
<p>Preparation: Grind the ingredients and first decoct 1 jin of Atractylodes in 5 sheng of water, until reduced to 3 sheng. Remove the Atractylodes dregs, then add the aforementioned 12 ingredients and further decoct until yielding 3 to 4 cups of clear liquid. This should be divided into 3 or 4 doses to be taken throughout the day. Additionally, another decoction can be made from the Atractylodes dregs, straining it to follow the same decoction method with the remaining 12 ingredients. This formula clears away dampness and stagnant heat, balancing the stomach qi. </p>
<p>If symptoms persist, a half-dose may be used. In cases of constipation or irritability, a small amount of Huanglian Decoction can be taken. If there is slight diarrhea and the irritability has passed, a half-dose of the internal reinfusion powder can be taken. This method ensures both nourishing and protective energies operate effectively, preventing the invasion of pathogenic energy.<a id="trans-277p" href="#orig-277p" class="marker">[277p]</a><br><strong>Danggui Huangqi Decoction</strong>: Used for treating sores and ulcers on the head and neck, where the internal organs have already been affected, with unbearable pain.

To prepare, finely chop the ingredients and take one tael with one bowl of water, decocting until reduced to five portions, then strain and take warm. If there is fever, add Huangqin; if there is restlessness preventing sleep, add Zhizi. If vomiting occurs, it indicates dampness invading the stomach.</p>

If pain decreases with moxibustion, then continue until it is numb; if it is numb, then increase moxibustion until it causes pain. The toxin will disperse with the fire, allowing for the smooth removal of stagnant toxins. This is a method for treatment and has the power to revive. </p>
<p>Peel the garlic, slice it about the thickness of three coins, and place it on the sore. Use strong moxa on the garlic and perform moxibustion three times, then replace the garlic and continue moxibustion. If the sore has not yet fully formed, it will disperse; if it is fully formed, it will still weaken its force and cause no harm. For larger sores, pound the garlic into a paste and apply it to the affected area, then place moxa on top and burn it. Replace the garlic when it becomes scorched. If there is no pain or pus doesn’t form, or if it is a Yin sore, it is especially advisable to perform moxibustion more frequently. If moxibustion still does not bring pain, pus, or any sign of formation, it indicates a severe deficiency of Qi and blood and should not be treated.</p>

Stop the fire momentarily and use a cloth bag to filter out the dregs, measuring the oil to the precise amount needed. Clean the pot thoroughly, then use fine silk to filter the oil back into the pot, ensuring cleanliness for the best results. </p>
<p>Add any leftover blood and simmer slowly until it rises to the surface. Use a willow stick to stir; when it appears to have a melting paste-like consistency, it is considered properly cooked. For every pound of clean oil, add six and a half ounces of yellow lead oxide gradually, increasing the heat slightly. In the heat of summer and autumn, add five more ounces of lead for every pound of oil. </p>
<p>Continue stirring without pause and wait for the pot to first emit green smoke, followed by successive rising clouds of white smoke with a fragrant aroma. At this point, the paste is finished, and you can stop the fire. </p>
<p>Drop a bit of the paste into water to test its softness and firmness, adjusting with more cooked oil if it seems too hard or with more lead if it&#39;s too soft, each in small amounts. Gradually increase the heat, ensuring suitable texture for both winter and summer. </p>
<p>Once the smoke dissipates, remove the pot from the heat and add asafoetida, cutting it into thin slices and spreading it over the surface of the paste to fully dissolve; then add a light powder of myrrh and mix well. Pour this into water, using the willow stick to form it into a block. Then switch to cold water for soaking. At a warm temperature, take half a pound of the paste, stretch and twist it until it forms a block. Once again, switch to cold water for soaking. Whenever you need to use it, take a piece, melt it in a copper ladle as needed, and spread it out as desired for optimal results.<a id="trans-297p" href="#orig-297p" class="marker">[297p]</a><br>Tianma Cakes</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 taels of rhizoma</li>
<li>Whole scorpion</li>
<li>Dendrobium</li>
<li>Clear gastrodia</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice</li>
<li>Angelica</li>

<li>Qianghuo</li>
<li>Schizonepeta</li>
<li>Wind-breaking</li>
<li>Northern xixin</li>
<li>Ephedra</li>
<li>Sichuan blackfinger bathed in broth, skin and tip removed</li>
<li>1 tael each of He Shou Wu</li>
<li>6 qian of realgar</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind the right ingredients into a fine powder, refine with honey into pills the size of a marbles. Each medicine weighed 1 tael is divided into four pills, 1 tael into six pills, and 1 tael into nine pills, prepared in three amounts for aging and acute conditions. Pre-prepare 6 qian of cinnabar, grind finely to use as a coating, and store in a ceramic jar.</p>
<p>If sores appear within two to three days or if boils have formed within ten days but have not yet produced pus, they may present as typhoid with symptoms of headache, thirst, rigidity, aversion to cold, pain in the limbs, nausea and vomiting, heaviness in the body, and confusion, leading to restlessness in sitting and lying with warm skin. It is also effective for typhoid and seasonal colds, for epidemic symptoms where there is aversion to cold and heat, but the exterior symptoms are not yet fully resolved, should be taken accordingly.<a id="trans-299p" href="#orig-299p" class="marker">[299p]</a><br>Use nine stalks of green onions, including the white part, and boil them in a tea kettle to make a broth. Take a pill of the medicine, dissolve it in the hot broth, and take it all at once. Cover up to induce sweating for effect. If sweating is delayed after taking the medicine, use the green onion broth again to promote it. Sweating will then occur profusely, gradually leading to the removal of covering garments, and the sweat will naturally subside. The patient will feel refreshed and the illness will dissipate. However, if the illness has not fully developed, it will fade immediately; if it has developed, there will be swelling and purulence. </p>
<p>For conditions lacking external symptoms and not requiring dispersal, simply use hot wine to dissolve the medicine. This formula is originally recorded in the Treatise on Wind and Abscesses, and I have always used it to disperse snake poison, with very quick results, hence it is transcribed here. </p>
<p>Upon careful examination of this formula, it is notably effective in treating swellings and abscesses because all sores arise from the imbalance of the defensive and nourishing qi, causing stagnation of qi and blood, which leads to boils and swellings. This medicine&#39;s nature is to specifically disperse and can also regulate qi, dispel wind, and clear the meridians, effectively resolving blockages. Moreover, since sores and toxins accumulate over time, they can only be resolved by gentle warmth and spicy heat to induce sweating and relief, achieving the intended outcome. </p>
<p>After taking the medicine, avoid wind and consume light porridge. Avoid cold foods and sexual activity. Pregnant women should not take this.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a><br>Chaihu Qinggan Decoction is used to treat the early stages of scalp furuncle before it has fully developed, regardless of whether it is due to excess heat or deficiency.

The skin is the pathway.<br>The Yellow Emperor asks: I have heard that wind is the onset of a hundred diseases. How should it be treated with needles? Qibo responds: Wind enters from the outside, causing chills, sweating, headache, body heaviness, and aversion to cold; it should be treated at the Fengfu point, adjusting Yin and Yang. If deficient, it should be supplemented; if excessive, it should be drained.<br>Evil Qi attacking the foot&#39;s taiyang channel causes pain in the head, neck, and shoulders. Acupuncture is then done at the small toe nail, targeting each point to prompt immediate relief. If it persists, puncture beneath the outer ankle at three points, alternating sides; relief will come as soon as you eat.<br>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: For diseases in the upper part, one should treat from below; for diseases in the lower part, one should treat from above. For head ailments, treat from the foot; for waist issues, treat at the knee pit.<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a><br>The center of the palm governs the distinctions, known as Neiguan, located two inches from the wrist, between the two tendons, following the channel above, connecting to the heart&#39;s pericardium. When the heart is full, it causes heart pain; when empty, it results in head heaviness, taken between the two tendons.</p>
<p>The distinction of the Governing Vessel is called Changqiang, located along the spine up to the nape, spreading through the head above and below, around the shoulders to the left and right, branching into the Taiyang channel that connects to the spine. When full, it results in stiffness in the spine; when empty, it leads to a heavy head. To alleviate it, one should locate the branches.</p>

The Taiyang point on the foot, which connects to the brain, rightly pertains to the eyes and is called Yanjie. For severe head and eye pain, treat it between the two tendons at the nape, entering the brain.</p>
<p>In the case of fever with a pale face and head pain, accompanied by restlessness in the hands and feet, treat between the tendons with the fourth needle at the four extremes, taking care of tendons and eyes.

For headaches that cannot be needled, severe arthralgia presents as a malignancy; daily occurrences may lead to slight improvement, but it must not be disregarded. </p>

If needling is required, one should needle to tonify or reduce. If needling is not appropriate, moxibustion should be used instead.

The related points are: Liyuan, Neiting, Xiangu, Chongyang, and Jiexi. When the issue emanates from the brain, the person initially feels an unbearable headache, often as if it would develop into an ulcer. The brain is the sea of marrow; therefore, moxibustion and acupuncture should be employed to dispel the pathogenic qi. The brain, being a dwelling, indicates that if the pulse is floating, it comes from the Taiyang channel; if it is long, it derives from the Yangming channel; if it is wiry, it originates from the Shaoyang channel. </p>
<p>It is said: Each channel has its respective Jing, Ying, Yu, and He points. Jing points are related to fullness under the heart and ulcers of a dark color; Ying points relate to heat in the body and red ulcers; Yu points pertain to heaviness in the body and painful joints, with yellow ulcers; the Jing points are connected to coughs, chills, and fevers, and white ulcers; He points involve counterflow qi and black ulcers. If there are signs corresponding to the channels&#39; diseases, moxibustion or acupuncture may be indicated to dispel the pathogenic qi. </p>
<p>The text states that when pathogenic qi accumulates internally, it causes swelling and heat, and it should be treated with stone needles. The Inner Canon states: For stagnant qi that obstructs breathing, it is best to open it with needles; if qi overwhelms blood and results in accumulation, stones should be used to release it.

For sores that have already begun to swell and harden slightly, with unchanged skin color and a deep pulse that is not painful, one should perform external moxibustion to draw out the evil qi and alleviate the condition. If there is pus, moxibustion should not be used; rather, one should prick it. If it is superficial, moxibustion is also not advisable. The Classics say: For concave areas, perform moxibustion. If there is slight hardness that does not cause pain, urgent moxibustion should be applied, as the evil qi is deeply embedded. Do not perform moxibustion on superficial issues; proceed with caution. </p>

<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: For headache guidance and manipulation techniques: at the Baihui point, dig in 64 degrees, rubbing as counted, and also perform the posterior exercises. </p>
<p>For the exercises: if the pain is on the left, envision a large tendon below the left breast and pull it over to the right breast; if the pain is on the right, pull it over to the left breast, performing each for twelve degrees. For headaches: focus on the navel and push down to the Yongquan point. </p>
<p>For a heavy head and blurry vision, the guidance is: observe emptiness, sit still and hold your breath, using both palms to cover the ears and beat a heavenly drum; next, rub the Yongquan point; then press the knees with the hands and sit upright, exhaling nine breaths, establishing focused intention. </p>
<p>For the exercises: focus on a tranquil state, tongue against the upper palate, wait for saliva to gradually accumulate, swallow it frequently, and return the focus to the navel, rolling the eyes, which will lead to a light head and clear vision. </p>
<p>For headaches, brain pain, and phlegm stagnation guidance: sit with a single knee raised, placing two fingers to block the ears and the seven orifices (mouth, eyes, nose); bend forward slightly with gentle force to allow true qi to rise, dispersing brain evil. </p>
<p>For the exercises: focus on the navel, envision the pain on the head, dividing it to circulate to the heart and opening downward; visualize rotating the navel wheel to open the pathways, tightening your intent to move through the phlegm-stagnated area, circulating energy throughout the abdomen while focusing on the navel.<a id="trans-363p" href="#orig-363p" class="marker">[363p]</a><br>The method of guiding the spirit and energy: This condition is caused by emotional desires harming the body, leading to weakened qi and diminished blood, with heart fire attacking upwards, phlegm and fluids obstructing the lungs.

At the shoulder well point, perform the manipulation 99 times, with similar rubbing, combined with later methods for self-healing.</p>
<p>For energy manipulation: Close the lower orifices tightly, calm the spirit and repress qi, pressing on the head and ears. The practitioner should be seated firmly, with bent legs and feet uncrossed, allowing the spirit and qi to return naturally, leading to the secretion of fluids, and swallowing will stabilize the mind.</p>
<p>For recovery from dizziness: Work on the shoulder well and hip ring points, performing the manipulation 99 times each, with reliance on natural healing.</p>
<p>For energy work: Press urgently on the ear gates and the forehead, while also restricting the crown point to stabilize the spirit. If the qi turns back, the heart will feel refreshed; care should be taken to delay speaking to secure the vital essence.</p>
<p>For vertigo: Close the mouth, stabilize the spirit, suppress qi, and press on the forehead and ear openings. Practitioners of significant skill should keep their feet bent and not allow them to stretch out, for fear that the qi may become difficult to regulate. This allows swallowing of fluids, opening the major orifices, ensuring the spirit remains present, allowing one to quickly regain awareness of worldly matters.</p>
<p>For the method of releasing the fetus, press on the crown point to send qi down to the elixir field. There are also those who lose consciousness; in such cases, one should press on the crown point.</p>
<p>For pear skin sores: Take water from the Yongquan point, washing up from the foot ribs to the sore on the top of the head; it can be cleared in a month. Additionally, guide downwards from the face to the toes, performing this 24 times each session.

<p>The &quot;Moxuan Manlu&quot; states: Wang Wengong, serving as a minister, was presenting matters in the hall when he suddenly felt an unbearable pain in his temples. He urgently submitted a request to return for treatment. The magistrate of Yuling was resting in the central office at that time. After a while, a small attendant brought a small golden cup with a little medicine and said: &quot;If the pain is on the left, pour it into the right nostril; if it is on the right, do the reverse; if both sides are painful, pour it into both nostrils.&quot; Immediately, the pain was relieved. The next day, upon expressing gratitude, the emperor said: &quot;Since the time of Taizu, there have been several such remedies kept within the palace, not to be transmitted outside; this is one of them.&quot; Consequently, he also presented this remedy. Su Shi, returning from Huangzhou, passed by Jinling, where Anshi shared this remedy, using it with miraculous effect. However, when the eyes turned red for a brief moment, the headache was also cured. The method involves using fresh radish, extracting the natural juice, adding a little raw dragon’s brain, and mixing it well; then tilting the head back and having someone drip it into the nostrils.<a id="trans-365p" href="#orig-365p" class="marker">[365p]</a><br>In &quot;Truncated Farming Records,&quot; it is said: Ren Zizao mentioned that while living in the capital, the son of a neighbor suffered from unbearable headaches. A returning Muslim physician used a knife to cut open his forehead, extracting a small crab that was as hard as stone but still able to move. Shortly thereafter, it died, and the pain subsided. They managed to obtain the crab, which is still kept to this day. Xia Xue Suo remarked: I once saw a guest&#39;s horse at the Changmen of Pingjiang with a swollen belly collapsed on the ground. An old Muslim happened to be present in the inn and cut a small piece from inside its left leg without knowing what it was. The horse then promptly got up and rode away.

<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Filial Piety,&quot; it is stated: A monk from Danxia suffered from headaches, often staying in a dark room, afraid to see the light. His head was hot and painful, so he wrapped a cloth around it and placed ice inside, changing it several times a day, but the heat could not be quelled. Various doctors failed to diagnose the condition, so he sought the help of a Dai person. The Dai said: This is because the Triple Yang Meridians are retaining heat. He then set charcoal fire in a warm room to induce sweating and vomiting, employing all three methods. Only after seven days did he recover.

He had been taking purgatives for a month and was additionally affected by the heat. His organs were weakened due to age, leading to his collapse outside in the sunlight, leaving him unaware of his surroundings. His family was alarmed and wanted to shake him awake. The doctor advised against disturbing him, saying, “This would be a grave mistake.” Instead, he provided him with cool watermelon and honeyed water, and shortly after, the man recovered. It is likely that, due to his old age and purging, his pulse was easily disturbed, and his body was overheated while also exposed to the sun, resulting in his fainting. Disturbing him would worsen the situation. The key was to calm his spirit, using cool water to treat him, allowing time for rest. With tranquility, he would naturally get better. If treated hastily by other doctors, this would lead to confusion, clearly demonstrating the doctor&#39;s expertise.</p>
<p>There was a woman over forty who suffered from pain above her forehead and around her ears, experiencing migraines for five to seven years. Each episode caused her bowels to dry and become impacted, her eyes turning red, dizzy, and unable to see far. She had taken many so-called headache treatments like “head wind pills and white dragon pills,” which only slightly alleviated her pain while causing her constipation and worsening her vision. She had undergone numerous acupuncture treatments over the years, and her sight was now in jeopardy due to the illness, leading to infertility. One day, she consulted the doctor again, who examined her pulse. It was rapid and strong, indicating a severe presence of wind and heat. Having observed numerous patients over the past forty or fifty years, I recognized that in both men and women suffering from migraines, there was always significant constipation and hard stools connected with the ailment.<a id="trans-367p" href="#orig-367p" class="marker">[367p]</a><br>This is nothing other than headaches or pain at the temples, which are due to the relationship of the Sanjiao&#39;s fire and the Yangming dryness of metal. The dryness of metal, when it overcomes the liver, causes liver qi to stagnate. When liver qi stagnates, the flow of qi and blood becomes obstructed; when qi and blood are obstructed, there is no communication between upper and lower, leading to internal dryness and ultimately resulting in loss of vision. </p>
<p>To treat this, use the Dà Chéng Qì Tāng (Major Order the Qi Decoction), prepare it with three taels of river water, add one tael of brine, boil it until ready, allow it to cool slightly, and then divide it into three to five doses. Take all doses continuously to wash away the accumulated dryness and heat in the intestines, resulting in very liquid bowel movements, over twenty times. </p>
<p>Next, take Qī Xuān Wán (Seven Heralding Pill) and Shén Gōng Wán (Divine Efficacy Pill) to nourish and moisten.

After five to ten days, if the weather is clear and bright, take one dose of Dà Chéng Qì Tāng at night, and this will reduce the pain as the bowel movements become more frequent. After three doses, the eyes will clear and the heavy feeling will lift, leading to recovery.

It felt as if he were caught in a storm, suffering severe headaches, a heavy body like a mountain, with cold extremities and unable to find a comfortable position to rest.

<p>In a memory by Yuan Haowen, he recounts that he often drank alcohol, and in mid-September, developed small sores at the back of his head and neck. After several days, his brain and neck became numb, and the swelling became pronounced.

On the eighteenth day, he finally expelled pus, after which he underwent treatment with either medicine or acupuncture. It took three months for healing to begin, yet by April, it had returned to an unfavorable state. He recalled a medical text indicating that when pus appears in a sore, the chances of survival are slim. Taking the physician&#39;s words to heart, he sought out Li Ming for a diagnosis, who suggested that due to the changes from rich foods, it was inappropriate to use the Five Spice, and that he should adopt a fire attack strategy first before proceeding with medications.<a id="trans-370p" href="#orig-370p" class="marker">[370p]</a><br>Using a large moxa stick like a peach pit, one attacks until reaching a hundred strong strokes, then one feels pain.

The beginning is the same, but the end is different; it can break accumulations and dissolve hard masses. It can harmonize the qi and ensure the outcome, but first consider the seasonal qi, without disturbing the natural harmony. When speaking of timing, one can collect but must not sweat. Both the meridian and the disease are to be prevented from descending. Treatments that should condense must be dispersed, and all should be softened.<a id="trans-371p" href="#orig-371p" class="marker">[371p]</a><br>When affected by cold pathogens, one must avoid salty foods; the main treatment consists of bitter cold substances, with sweet cold as an assistant. Hot alcohol serves as a medium to warm the Qi and blood. The use of strong warm spices helps to resolve blockages, employing three strong and three sweet agents to enhance original Qi and harmonize the blood vessels, facilitating the expulsion of dampness from alcohol.</p>
<p>To support the autumn season, we enhance Qi and dispel fire, incorporating the medicines from the classic text to harmonize the blood, using main herbs such as Huang Qin, Huang Lian, Huang Bo, Sheng Di Huang, and Zhi Mu processed with wine. From the classic text, Qiang Huo, Du Huo, Gao Ben, Fang Feng, Fang Ji, Dang Gui, and Lian Qiao are used to resolve blockages. Astragalus, ginseng, and licorice complement the bitter cold herbs at a ratio of one third; exceeding this nourishes the Qi and replenishes the body. </p>
<p>Raw licorice clears kidney fire and replenishes the lower jiao source Qi, while ginseng and orange peel nourish the stomach. Sappan wood and Dang Gui help remove stagnant blood; Sheng Di Huang replenishes blood, while Fang Ji processed with wine eliminates retained heat in the bladder. Ze Xie assists in autumn by dispelling damp heat from alcohol.</p>
<p>All these herbs must include Jie Geng as a vehicle to prevent sinking. After administration, no pain should occur from sores, and bodily health remains intact. If taken as advised, one may fall into a deep sleep, waking only at dawn. Upon examination, swelling decreases by seventy to eighty percent, and the sores should scab over completely within fourteen days. </p>
<p>While traditional medicine employs techniques with tangible results, beyond mere efficacy, it can also navigate the unspoken mysteries of the body. In my lifetime, I have only encountered one person of clear understanding. This prescription is named Huang Lian Xie Du Yin.<a id="trans-372p" href="#orig-372p" class="marker">[372p]</a><br>Bai Canmou, whose name is De and courtesy name is Zhong Shi, was sixty-one years old. In the second month of the Renzi year, he suffered from unbearable headaches, unable to sleep day or night. He was invited by the physician Cao Tongfu to be examined. The patient said: Recently, while in Yanqing, he initially experienced dizziness and slight pain. The doctors treated him for typhus, and after sweating, the pain worsened. After further sweating, his condition deteriorated, and his headaches intensified, leading him to return home. Whenever he visited local areas, he called for physicians and took medicine, but the pain was severe, and he could not lie down comfortably. He was sensitive to wind and cold, and he did not want to eat. Upon examining his six pulses, they were thin and weak, with short and rapid breathing, and he spoke with fatigue. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In spring, illness manifests in the head. Due to age and weakness, the clear energy cannot rise to the head and face, causing dizziness and gloom. This illness originally had no exterior pathogen; excessive sweating caused a further depletion of clear yang energy, which could not spring up to nourish, and therefore he suffered from headaches and sensitivity to wind and cold, with shortness of breath and aversion to food. It is appropriate to use warm and pungent herbs. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Yang energy protects the exterior and provides firmness.<a id="trans-373p" href="#orig-373p" class="marker">[373p]</a><br>This year, the Qi is high but weak, coupled with excessive sweating, resulting in a further depletion of the defensive Qi. Therefore, Astragalus, sweet and warm, is the ruler to tonify the Wei and strengthen the exterior; Ginseng, sweet and warm, and Angelica, spicy and warm, are used to nourish the blood and Qi and serve as the minister; Atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and roasted licorice, bitter and sweet, warm the stomach Qi, generate Yang Qi, and support the exterior and skin as assistants; Bupleurum and Cimicifuga, bitter and neutral, elevate the lesser Yang and Yangming Qi, open the hundred vessels, and nourish the entire body. Chuanxiong, Vitex, and Asarum, spicy and warm, are light and clear to open the orifices, serving as envoys. In the spring of next year, when summoned to Liupan Mountain, Dr. Cao generously offered an ancient poem; Li Ming of Dongyuan, early known for his medical skills, found profound insights in the waters of the Yi River, exhausting the golden treasures. A lamp in a quiet room reveals profound truths, as the Yellow Emperor in the Inner Canon praises Qibo in awe. Days accumulate and are not easily sold, is half a lifetime merely to break an arm three times? The medicine I excel in has its own liveliness, yet old prescriptions are piled high like raw fish. I do not hear of Li Yan dwelling with the same illness; upon sweating together, clarity comes by morning. Thus, I know the ancients had one prescription for one syndrome, while later generations matched prescriptions to symptoms, a principle yet to be clarified. Those who discern this with public-mindedness are often criticized by ordinary folk. The teacher, regretting to sleep beneath the yellow earth, leaves his students relying on your brilliance. The mission of saving lives will be shared, and one&#39;s authority is not trivial. For years summoned by the Tian Ce Bureau, the humble grass and trees all thrive exuberantly. It is best to treasure the rich and vibrant leaves, lest Fan He alone monopolizes fame.<a id="trans-374p" href="#orig-374p" class="marker">[374p]</a><br>&quot;The Heart Method of Danxi&quot; states: An old woman suffered from red and white vaginal discharge for a year and a half. She experienced dizziness that made it impossible to sit, but she could rest when lying down; focused treatment on the discharge led to an improvement in both the discharge and her dizziness.</p>
<p>A man, seventy-nine years old, experienced heavy dizziness and weakness in his hands and feet, continuous phlegm production, a weak and large pulse in his left hand, a slow and large pulse in his right hand which was weaker than the left, with no response upon heavy pressing, reduced appetite and mild thirst, and had bowel movements once every three to four days. Everyone administered wind-dispersing herbs, predicting he would surely die by late spring. I said this was a case of great deficiency and should be treated with a strong tonic. The crowd was angered and left. I recommended using ginseng, angelica, astragalus, peony, and white atractylodes, boiled into a concentrated broth, supplemented with thirty pills of a particular remedy. After a year and a half of such treatment, his vitality returned to that of a young man. During winter, the remedy was enhanced with a bit of dry ginger; for the rest of the seasons, the same method was followed. The remedy was made into fine powder by stir-frying with ginger juice, and further formed into pills by cooking with ginger juice to create a paste.<a id="trans-375p" href="#orig-375p" class="marker">[375p]</a><br>&quot;The Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: A woman suddenly experienced dizziness and was unable to move. Upon examining her pulse, it was found to be large and floating, indicating that she had phlegm-dampness exacerbated by heat. After administering Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction and one hundred rolling phlegm pills, she recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;The Medical Guidelines&quot; states: A child had been shaking his head for seven years and had been experiencing blood in his stools for three years, with no treatment effective. Reflecting on this, I determined that there was an abundance of liver blood and external wind-heat disturbing him. The liver belongs to wood; when wood is strong, it overcomes the earth, resulting in the spleen being affected, and both the spleen and lungs, as mother and child, are overcome by the liver, leading to blood seeping into the stools, hence the persistent bloody stools. I then prescribed a remedy that would drain the liver, dispel wind, and nourish the spleen. After just a few doses, he was cured. Within ten days, the bleeding stopped, and white pus was expelled, allowing him to stabilize. </p>
<p>The prescription included three taels of Fangfeng, five qian of Guo Lao root, honey-fried Huangqi, Qianghuo, and Bai Shao, each five qian, two and a half qian of powdered rhinoceros horn and licorice, and one qian each of snake skin, Gouteng fruit, and Ma Huang. These were ground into a powder, combined with date flesh to form pills the size of a walnut, to be taken with peppermint tea after meals, five to seventy pills per dose. After just two doses, the head shaking stopped, and the bloody stools subsequently healed.<a id="trans-376p" href="#orig-376p" class="marker">[376p]</a><br>Scholar Zhang Juyin, a librarian and a bachelor, had a fondness for wine and was carefree, unconcerned with fame or profit. He suddenly developed a fever and headache, and the physicians from the Hanlin Academy treated him for ten days, but his condition worsened. The other scholars collectively decided to summon Sun. Upon his arrival, Sun examined his pulse and said: &quot;Others all claim this is due to a cold attack, hence this illness. However, Scholar Zhang is fond of wine and has much phlegm; this is caused by what he has consumed. The illness is not due to a cold, as the pulse in his right hand is rapid while the left hand is steady. This must be a headache caused by overindulgence in food and drink. He should take five to seven pills of dietary medicine.&quot; After half a day of waiting, a resolution was reached. Sun then administered the dietary medicine, and gradually, as he digested, his chest became more comfortable, and the headache lessened. After further doses of digestives, he found relief. Generally speaking, when a yang pathogen causes a headache, it would not fail to result in fever and confusion after ten days. Thus, it is clear that this is not a cold, but rather an ailment caused by food.<a id="trans-377p" href="#orig-377p" class="marker">[377p]</a><br>An elderly woman suffered from a persistent headache for many years. Upon examining her limbs, all her blood vessels were purple-black. She then used a three-edged needle to extract several cups of blood that resembled ink. After observing the meridians affected by her illness, she used moxibustion and acupuncture, resulting in complete recovery. This aligns with the idea that severe blockage causes ailments, and persistent headaches can obstruct the body; the extraction of her blood was a result of this treatment.</p>
<p>A man, due to worries and fatigue, experienced dizziness, dim vision, tinnitus, a flushed face, dry mouth, fevers, and difficulty breathing, with sweat but no appetite. His six pulses were rapid and strong. He was treated with a modified formula of the Ten Comprehensive Tonics Decoction, omitting cassia and adding raw rehmannia, ginger-fried coptis, ophiopogon, schisandra, aged tangerine peel, wine-fried berberine, and anemarrhena, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>According to the medical case of Xue Ji: The esteemed elder Liang Houzhai had shortness of breath with phlegm, dark and turbid urine, and heel pain. His pulse was floating and large; pressing it felt weakened, indicating kidney deficiency with phlegm. He was treated with the Four Substances Decoction combined with the Six Flavors Pill, and in less than a month he recovered. Master Zhongjing stated: When there is deficiency of qi with fluid retention, kidney qi pills should be used to tonify and eliminate it. This truly enlightens the understanding of future scholars and benefits countless individuals. The kidney qi pills refer to the Six Flavors Pill.<a id="trans-378p" href="#orig-378p" class="marker">[378p]</a><br>Du Xian Meng had a shortness of breath and phlegm retention, and after taking a pungent remedy, he experienced excessive phlegm and a two-foot floating pulse that felt hollow upon pressing. I believed the kidneys could not gather the qi and return it to its source, and the excess of aromatic dryness was the main issue. I prescribed the Eight Flavor Pill, and he recovered in three doses. </p>
<p>Sun Du Xian had a robust physique but was mentally exhausted due to joy and anger. He had a bright complexion, was thirsty, and coughed up phlegm. At times, he experienced dizziness or heat rising from his abdomen. His left three pulses were strong and forceful, while the right three pulses were strong yet without power. I concluded that there was a deficiency in the three yin pathways of his legs, so I used a formula to tonify the center and enhance qi, adding wheat kernel and five flavors and modifying the Eight Flavor Pill, after which he recovered. Should a person display signs of aging, be intolerant to cold and heat, or be unable to withstand work, and fall ill with changing seasonal ailments, it is often due to insufficient blood and qi during youth, along with mental strain, or possibly a deficiency in essence and blood due to excessive indulgence in sexual activity, thus making it hard to ascertain the full symptom picture. This insufficient essence and qi can be restored by nourishing the source of transformation, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if one&#39;s diet and exertion are excessive, accompanied by inappropriate emotions leading to various symptoms, the previous methods of treatment should apply. If the six pathogenic factors invade and cause illness, it is often due to true qi being weak and external pathogens invading; thus, reinforcing the stomach qi is paramount. The stomach is the foundation of the five organs, hence the caution against lightly using yellow brew and Anemarrhena, as they may further damage the stomach qi. Generally, mixed conditions belonging to internal causes indicate that both the vital and pathogenic energies are lacking, so treatment should focus on tonifying rather than purging. Lastly, though typhoid falls under external causes, it is also necessary to differentiate between interior and exterior, as well as between deficiency and excess, for appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a><br>Changping guard Wang Tiancheng was affected by severe cold, feeling weak and fatigued. He improved slightly with food, but his condition worsened with exertion. His pulse was floating and large, indicating weakness in the spleen and lungs. He was treated with a formula of &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; with added Vitex fruit and recovered. Later, due to overwork, he experienced fever, chills, delirium, and insomnia, but found relief with the same decoction and fully recovered.<a id="trans-380p" href="#orig-380p" class="marker">[380p]</a><br>The great official Zhu Zhi-shan, due to anger, experienced headaches and muscular spasms, sometimes accompanied by chills and fever, with particularly severe heat in the afternoons. This was attributed to liver fire causing muscle spasms and deficient qi, for which he used over twenty doses of the Eight Treasures Decoction with additions of Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Mu Dan Pi, and subsequently recovered.</p>
<p>At the residence of the upper class, Gu Tong-shi was drinking with others when he asked me: &quot;Both Xiang Meng You-ya and Chen Dong-gu had no heirs and took concubines. Later, both fell ill, experiencing headaches and phlegmatic vomiting. They used Su He Xiang pills, but only You-ya survived; why is that?&quot; I replied: &quot;Both cases were due to kidney deficiency, which prevented the retention of qi, leading to headaches and inability to control water, resulting in phlegm. Dong-gu specialized in treating phlegm and promoting qi, while You-ya focused on nourishing fire and replenishing qi, hence the difference in outcomes.&quot; Later, responding to a request from a Hangzhou person, Tong-shi overworked himself and developed similar symptoms. When I advised clearing qi and transforming phlegm, his condition worsened. He said: &quot;My illness stems from kidney deficiency, which fails to return qi to its source. The treating physician did not understand and passed away; what a pity!&quot;</p>
<p>My late elder brother had a robust physique but expected much sputum. His pulse was strong and full, yet he could not endure labor. When affected by wind, he experienced headaches and was nearly fainting, leading to cracks in his mouth and tongue, sometimes becoming severely inflamed. A slight ingestion of ginger and garlic aggravated his mouth sores. He took Ba Wei Wan and the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with the addition of Fu Zi, which led to his recovery. After stopping the medicine for over a month, his symptoms reappeared. This indicated that the fire in the life gate was not returning to its source.<a id="trans-381p" href="#orig-381p" class="marker">[381p]</a><br>A woman suffered from swelling in her head and neck, experiencing unbearable pain, fever, and thirst, with a preference for cold. She took internal herbal remedies to clear heat and applied cold poultices externally. Her complexion was dark and lacking luster, and she felt a lump in her chest. This indicated a deficiency of Yang Qi and an accumulation of phlegm and fire, which did not respond to warming tonics. I used five qian each of ginseng and astragalus, and two qian each of ginger and cinnamon. In one dose, the swelling immediately burst. Afterward, I administered powerful tonics, and she recovered. </p>
<p>For cases of sores and swelling with severe pain and thirst for cold drinks, the condition shows both excess pathogenic and vital Qi. It is advisable to use Qing Re Xiao Du San (Clear Heat and Eliminate Toxins Powder) and Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin (Immortal&#39;s Prescription for Reviving Life) as the primary treatment. If there is severe swelling and pain, with dry mouth and a desire for hot drinks, the condition indicates excess pathogenic Qi and deficiency of vital Qi. The use of Tuo Li Xiao Du San (Discharge the Interior and Eliminate Toxins Powder) and Shan Qi Si Bu San (Four Tonics of Ginseng and Astragalus) should be the focus. If there is generalized swelling and mild pain, with poor appetite and fatigue, it indicates deficiency of both pathogenic and vital Qi, and one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Ingredients Decoction) and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction) to strengthen the spleen and stomach. This will help dissolve unformed swellings, promote drainage of those that have formed, and cause ruptured ones to heal.</p>
<p>One patient suffered from a brain abscess for over ten days, with a swollen face and tightly closed eyes, and a head as hot as a stove. The pulse was rapid and full, and the person was restless and craved cold drinks. This condition resulted from damp-heat in the bladder. I prescribed two doses of Huang Lian Xiao Du Yin (Coptis Elimination of Toxins Decoction) and then administered two bowls of sophora flower wine, which led to immediate improvement. Upon applying pressure with my fingers, the swelling would return, indicating that pus had formed. I then made an incision at the neck, forehead, shoulder, and cheek to allow the pus to drain, after which the mouth and eyes could open again. Further treatment with Tuo Li medicine combined with over thirty doses of honeysuckle and forsythia led to a complete recovery.<a id="trans-382p" href="#orig-382p" class="marker">[382p]</a><br>A person suffered from a severe brain abscess, with a solid abdomen. Treatment with a detoxifying powder of Huanglian was ineffective; instead, two taels of Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle) and two pints of water were boiled down to one pint, followed by taking half a cup of wine. The condition improved slightly after three to four doses, then gradually diminished. Additional doses of Huangbo, Zhimu, Guo Lou, Danggui, and Gan Cao were given, leading to the cessation of the abscess, and finally, Huangqi, Chuanxiong, Baizhi, and Jiegeng were prescribed for recovery.</p>
<p>Another person had a severe brain abscess with multiple headaches that were unbearable. After taking detoxifying medicine without effect, they were given Jin Yin Hua. This caused them to snore in sleep, and upon waking, their condition improved by half; further doses led to complete resolution.</p>
<p>Du Biqing was also a physician. He suffered from a brain abscess and was unable to heal it. Dan Xi visited him and asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t you take Fang Feng Tong Sheng San?&quot; He replied that he had already taken several doses. Dan Xi said, &quot;It should be combined with wine.&quot; Biqing then realized he had misjudged the treatment.</p>
<p>One person had swelling and pain in the head and face and worsened after taking a detoxifying medicine with Xie Huang. Upon diagnosis, the pulse was floating and rapid, indicating the pathogen was external and still unresolved. Two doses of Jing Jie Bai Du San were given, resulting in significant improvement; further treatment with four doses of Ge Gen Niu Bang Zi Tang led to complete recovery. This relied on pulse diagnosis for external releasing medicine.<a id="trans-383p" href="#orig-383p" class="marker">[383p]</a><br>Swelling and pain in the head and face, unresponsive to cooling medicine, require bloodletting with acupuncture. Afterwards, using the original formula will surely be effective. One man, thirty years old, suffered from shoulder toxicity. After taking two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San, he took ten Xuan San without ginseng and cinnamon, adding Jin Yin Hua and Tian Hua Fen for four doses, and it ruptured. Due to anger, liver fire moved, causing wind-heat to obstruct upwards, leading to swollen and painful head and face. Drinking cold water and taking Jing Fang Bai Du San with added Qín, Lián, and mint for two doses proved ineffective; urgently, acupuncture was applied to the afflicted area, releasing dark blood about a cup. After one more dose, the condition greatly improved, and he took four more doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San and completely healed.</p>
<p>In April of the second year of Taihe, there was a widespread epidemic, initially causing chills and fever. Next, symptoms included extreme swelling of the head and eyes, making it impossible to open the eyes, with difficulties in breathing, sore throat, dry tongue, and parched mouth. Commonly said, &quot;A big head brings calamity; relatives are disconnected, and many fall ill.&quot; One person suffered from this for five to six days, treated with Chengqi combined with Lán Gēn to purge, which provided slight relief; the next day, the illness returned to the original state; further purging yielded some relief, but ultimately, he could not recover, gradually worsening to a critical state. Dongyuan stated: &quot;Above half the body, it is Heaven&#39;s Qi; below half, it is Earth&#39;s Qi.&quot; Thus, the evil heat invaded between the heart and lungs, attacking upwards, causing swelling. Purging the stomach of excess heat with Chengqi was punishment without error, yet its effectiveness was not recognized. Therefore, it was decided to create the Puji Xiaodu decoction.<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a><br>A man suffered from a brain abscess, experiencing swelling and pain, with rapid pulse.

<p>Another man had a brain abscess with swelling in both the head and neck. Despite a large drainage, his swelling and pain worsened, accompanied by diarrhea, restlessness, insomnia, and poor appetite, posing a serious condition. Upon checking his pulse, the toxic elements were still present. He received two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Yin, which halved the swelling and pain. Together with Ershen Wan and Liu Junzi Tang, adding Schisandra, Ophiopogon, and Sour Jujube Seed, symptoms slightly improved, but his food intake remained low, and sleep was scarce. After several doses of Shenling Baizhu San, his appetite suddenly increased. He was then given Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with additional Honeysuckle, Angelica Dahurica, and Platycodon, and after a month, he recovered.<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a><br>An elder presented with redness, swelling, and pain, a rapid and strong pulse.

<p>Another woman had mild pain without pus formation. Using Tuo Li Xiaodu San, the abscess formed, was subsequently treated with acupuncture, and supplemented with Tuo Li medicine, resulting in recovery as well.</p>
<p>An elder had a clear abscess along with thirst; his pulse was soft and thin. I diagnosed him with deficiency of both Qi and blood and prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with additional Huangqi and Wumeizi. Initially, he was skeptical and took fire-clearing medicine, which caused him to vomit and eat less, leading him to believe in the treatment. After taking Xiangsha Liu Junzi Tang for four doses, his vomiting stopped, and he resumed eating; he then returned to the previous formula, and within a month, he recovered.</p>
<p>A man had yet to rupture but experienced thirst; his pulse was large yet weak. After administering four doses of Si Wu Tang with additions of Huangbai, Zhimu, Mai Dong, and Huangqi, his thirst decreased. He was then given Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan, which alleviated his thirst and allowed for the ulcer to rupture; further treatment with Tuo Li medicine and the previous formula led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another man experienced swelling and pain with a rapid pulse. After two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San, the pain subsided; further treatment with Tuo Li Xiaodu medicine led to resolution.</p>
<p>A man had burns, swelling, and pain with fever, drinking cold fluids; his pulse was strong and rapid. He was given two doses of Liangge San, which alleviated the symptoms. After four doses of Jinyinhua San, the abscess ruptured, and further treated with Tuo Li medicine led him to recovery.</p>
<p>An elderly woman with established symptoms had ongoing pain from a rupture, a firm pulse, and constipation.

Generally, if the pus is clean and the treatment does not respond or cause pain, or if it is a hard, obstructed condition, it is not treated.</p>
<p>Another man was on the verge of having an abscess, experiencing slight pain and thirst, with a weak and large pulse at the wrist. This was a sign of yin deficiency with heat. He believed the fire toxicity originated from the heart and took cooling herbs to reduce the fire, but it became more intense. Seeking further treatment, he was given the Four Substances Decoction, with additions of Huangbo, Zhimu, Wuweizi, Maidong, and Huangqi, along with a modified version of the Eight Treasure Pill. His thirst subsided and the sore healed; he was further treated with detoxifying medicine combined with the previously mentioned pill and recovered. </p>
<p>The “Zhongzang Jing” states that the formation of sores like carbuncles is due to accumulated toxicity in the five organs and six bowels, not solely from blockages in the defensive and nutritive qi. There are specific places where this occurs, and they correlate with their respective organs. For instance, if it arises in the throat or tongue, it is heart toxicity; in the skin or hair, it is lung toxicity; in the muscles, it is spleen toxicity; in the bones or marrow, it is kidney toxicity; arising below relates to yin toxicity, and above relates to yang toxicity; external issues are related to the six bowels and internal issues to the five organs. Therefore, internally it is termed necrosis, externally it is called ulceration, above is termed symptomatic, and below is termed obstructive. Conditions that arise above manifest quickly, while those that arise below manifest slowly. Affections of the six bowels are easier to treat, whereas those of the five organs are more difficult. From this perspective, if sores appear in the brain, it indicates that the bladder and governor vessel are involved, with insufficient yin energy and excessive yang fire manifesting outward.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a><br>How can one be solely focused on the fire of their heart without nourishing the yin energy? A person who usually neglects their daily routine, eating and drinking, experienced red swelling and pain, with a rapid pulse. They took two doses of Huanglian Xiedu San, which quickly eliminated the damp heat, but the swelling remained hard and painful. Two doses of Xianfang Huoming Yin were given, and both swelling and pain subsided, yet the sore did not heal. They then added Jiu Xuan San with the inclusion of Jin Yinhua, Gao Ben, Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, and Chen Pi to help discharge the pus. They wished for complete healing and self-prepared two doses of Huanglian Jiedu San, but the swelling remained hard without forming pus, which led to an understanding of their condition. They again used Jiu Xuan San with Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Chen Pi, and Ban Xia; the swelling gradually decreased, and they removed the Gui. After four more doses, pus was finally formed, and the swelling began to recede. They followed this with Ba Zhen Tang combined with Huang Qi, Wu Wei Zi, and Mai Men Dong; after about a month, the pus burst, and they recovered.<a id="trans-388p" href="#orig-388p" class="marker">[388p]</a><br>Bitter cold medicines, though they treat yin conditions, must carefully differentiate between the superficial and deep, the viable and the deficient, in accordance with the timing and appropriateness; one cannot simply use them throughout the treatment. However, swelling, redness, pain, and a rapid pulse reveal that damp heat is excessive in the bladder channel. Thus, we use Huang Lian Xiaodu San to detoxify and remove dampness. The swelling and hardness causing pain arise from stagnant qi and blood; therefore, we employ Xianfang Huo Ming Yin to disperse lumps, detoxify, and break up blood stasis. If the sore does not heal, it is likely due to the heat toxin lingering and the stagnation of qi and blood. A warm, sweet remedy should be used to nourish the yang qi and promote decay. Moreover, this condition originates in the governing vessel channel, arising from excessive yang fire. If one does not investigate the root cause and exclusively uses bitter cold medicines, the stomach qi will be harmed, leading to issues with decay and convergence. How can one avoid deterioration? Sore conditions are easily resolved, decay rapidly, and converge readily, all due to the robust qi and blood.<a id="trans-389p" href="#orig-389p" class="marker">[389p]</a><br>A woman, nearly seventy years old, was of an impatient nature and fond of wine. She had a brain abscess for five days, with a tight and rapid pulse. Urgently, a remedy was prepared using Da Huang (rhubarb) wine, mixed with finely chopped wine and stir-fried into a powder. This was additionally prepared with wine and ginseng, combined with ginger and boiled. After taking this for two doses, she could then lie down and, with sweating on the upper half of her body while sleeping, her illness was resolved. This reflects the idea of internal support. This treatment was based on her impatient disposition and fondness for wine, coupled with her pulse condition. The pulse was tight and rapid, which was due to her impatient nature and love for wine damaging her blood. Therefore, Da Huang was used to drain the heat from the wine, while ginseng was utilized to nourish her qi and blood.</p>
<p>Another woman experienced swelling and pain on the left side of her head, with pus draining from her left nostril. Her condition persisted for over a year, with occasional dizziness, as if sitting in a boat or vehicle. Xu Shuwei diagnosed this as liver deficiency with wind evil affecting her. He prescribed one tael of Chuanxiong, three qian of Danggui, and half a tael each of Qianghuo, Xuanfu flower, Xixin, Fangfeng, Manjingzi, Shigao, Gaoben, Jingjiesui, Banxia chut, Gan Di Huang, and Licorice. Each dose was one tael, and she was cured after one course. This case was recognized as liver deficiency with wind evil attack; thus, the treatment aimed to expel wind, clear heat, nourish blood, and eliminate phlegm, considering her dizziness and pain localized to the left. The classics state that all wind-related dizziness belongs to the liver wood. Additionally, the left side is governed by the liver and gallbladder, and it is mentioned that wind affects from above. There is also a saying that without phlegm, dizziness does not occur, and the liver stores blood. It is also said that wind is a yang evil. Therefore, the prescription targeting wind, heat, phlegm, and blood is logically fitting.<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a><br>An elderly man suffered from this ailment, exhibiting redness, swelling, and pain, with a rapid and strong pulse.

<p>A woman suffered from swelling, pain, and heat thirst during winter. I used a cooling and detoxifying remedy to resolve her condition, and she recovered. The following March, her tongue became swollen and large, and her body developed numerous boils resembling grapes, particularly on her hands and feet, indicating that her spleen and stomach had received toxins. I first drew out dark blood from various points, then administered seven pills of Duoming Dan, which resulted in her sweating profusely with a foul odor, and her sores heated up significantly. She experienced constipation for two days, so I prescribed three qian each of Dahuang, Qinshi, and Lianhua, along with two qian each of Shengma, Baizhi, Shanzhizi, Bohe, and Lianqiao, and one qian of ShengganCao, all boiled in water until three to five boils and taken. A large volume of foul blood was expelled with her urine, and slight relief was noted in her lower body. I then ground and mixed in rhino horn juice and continued the treatment. Blood with a foul odor emerged from her tongue and gum crevices, leading to the elimination of all toxins; she further recovered with the use of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction.<a id="trans-391p" href="#orig-391p" class="marker">[391p]</a><br>The cases mentioned above were all caused by the accumulation of heat from the sun, accompanied by wind, dampness, and emptiness. Their progression and retreat could be addressed using the method of Huanglian Disodu San.</p>
<p>Chen Lu, a judge, was over seventy years old. After the winter solstice, he developed an abscess on the back of his head, about the size of a bowl. Various ulcer doctors examined him, waiting for the sore to ripen so they could lance it with a needle to drain the pus. However, after being beaten by his concubine, the sore began to sink in, creating a depression about the size of a garlic leaf. His complexion turned a lackluster yellow, his limbs felt cold, he sweated yet his body felt cool, and he experienced periodic vomiting. His pulse was extremely weak and thin, and slow. This was due to his advanced age, the harshness of winter, and the suffering caused by his illness—he had a bland diet that eliminated the rich humors, leaving only a frail and emaciated form. Additionally, anger exacerbated his spirit&#39;s decline, leading to this cold transformation. His illness mirrored the season, and after consulting with the ulcer doctors, we promptly prepared a dose of Wuxiang Decoction, adding five qian each of clove and Aconite. After the dose was finished, the ulcer again became inflamed, and he was treated accordingly to achieve recovery.<a id="trans-392p" href="#orig-392p" class="marker">[392p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In treating illness, one must examine the underlying conditions. This refers to assessing the appropriateness of treatment based on the current situation. All pain, itching, sores, and ulcers are associated with heart fire, which is its usual state. However, when sores are severe and the body appears emaciated, with pain rising and cold descending, this is abnormal. Therefore, one should carefully consider the timing and appropriateness of treatment to correct this imbalance. Thus, it is said that the &quot;classics&quot; represent the constant, the &quot;laws&quot; are for application, and the &quot;physicians&quot; provide intent. Treatment should be adapted to what is suitable in order to achieve comprehensive effectiveness.</p>
<p>In this case of an elderly person enduring the cold of winter, it is appropriate to warm and tonify. A formula of five spices was used, adding Angelica Daphne (Dingfu) for a dispersive effect; why? Because their anger had been repressed, obstructing the flow of yang energy, leading to stagnation. Moreover, their pulse was extremely deep, thin, and slow, indicating qi stagnation. Thus, five spices were used to open the blockages and Dingfu was added to support yang energy; this would disperse the stagnation and restore yang, thus promoting healing. This also reflects the treatment according to the nature of their pulse.</p>
<p>Lady Ye, dressed in fine clothing, suffered from a brain abscess, presenting with dry mouth and thirsty tongue. Internally, she took cooling herbs and externally applied soothing treatments, appearing dark and lacking vitality. She experienced chest oppression, indicating a deficiency of yang energy combined with cold. They suspected a phlegm-heat condition, which did not respond to warming and tonifying treatments. I prescribed five qian of ginseng and astragalus, two qian each of ginger and cinnamon; in one dose, her swelling subsided dramatically. Further, she received restorative herbs and was cured.</p>
<p>Another individual was on the verge of developing pus, experiencing slight pain along with thirst, with a large but weak pulse; this reflects a condition of yin deficiency with active fire. They believed it was a heat toxicity of the heart, and their self-medication with cooling herbs intensified the issue. After further consultation, the treatment involved a combination of the Four Substance Decoction, adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Wuwei, Maidong, and Huangqi, along with adjustments from the Eight Flavor Pills. Their thirst was alleviated and the sores healed; additionally, resolving agents were used alongside the previous pills, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-393p" href="#orig-393p" class="marker">[393p]</a><br>A man suffering from a brain abscess experienced thirst; though his pulse was rapid, it lacked strength. I provided him with the modified Eight Flavor Pill, but he did not believe it and instead used nourishing yin medicines. Consequently, he suffered severe complications and died. The &quot;Essentials&quot; state that although abscesses are said to involve heat, they arise from deficiency. After recovery, thirst may occur, or it may come before the abscess; it is only the modified Eight Flavor Pill that can treat it.</p>
<p>Another man had a brain abscess, fever, and thirst. The physician used bitter and cold medicines, which increased the pus and intensified his fever. His face turned red, lips and tongue became dry, and he experienced painful urination, neither able to sleep night nor day, leading to a rapid death. When asked to treat him, I used the modified Eight Flavor Pill along with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, ophiopogon, and licorice in decoction. He slept soundly for half a day, and upon waking, all symptoms had subsided. In just a few doses, the abscess healed. I mentioned that although the disease had healed, the fundamental essence must be fortified. He did not heed this warning and failed to observe the necessary prohibitions. The following year, he suffered a stroke and subsequently developed a spinal abscess, leading to his death.</p>
<p>An elderly man had a clear pus accompanied by thirst, with a soft and weak pulse. I believed he had both qi and blood deficiencies and prescribed the Eight Treasure Decoction with added astragalus and five-flavor berry. He did not believe this and instead took fire-reducing medicines, resulting in vomiting and reduced appetite, which made him start to trust me. After taking the Six Gentlemen Decoction with cardamom and four doses, his vomiting ceased, and he was able to eat again. He continued the previous decoction for over a month and made a full recovery.<a id="trans-394p" href="#orig-394p" class="marker">[394p]</a><br>One person experienced pain in the head and neck, and although the severe swelling and pain increased significantly, accompanied by diarrhea, restlessness, and insomnia, with a diminished appetite and thought, the condition appeared dire. Upon examining the pulse, it indicated the presence of toxin. I prescribed two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction, which reduced the swelling and pain by half. Then, I administered Er Shen Wan and Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding Wu Wei, Mai Dong, and Suan Zao Ren in four doses, which led to a slight reduction of symptoms, improved appetite, and some sleep. Next, I prescribed Shen Ling Bai Zhu San for several doses, which further improved their appetite. Finally, after one month of taking Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, with the addition of Jin Yin Hua, Bai Zhi, and Jie Geng, the patient recovered completely.</p>
<p>The scholar Pan Guangfu, over forty years old, suffered from a brain abscess and swelling. His pulse was deep and calm. I indicated that this was a Yang condition with an underlying Yin pulse that could not rise, and it indeed turned out to be so. Although sores and abscesses relate to heart fire, it is particularly important to differentiate between the exterior and interior, and between deficiency and excess. If the vital energy is robust but there is substantial internal fire, then cold remedies might be effective. However, excessive cold could weaken the stomach and spleen, causing a transformation from Yang to Yin, potentially leading to either a closure without rupture or rupture that does not heal. This would result in a discordance between Yin and Yang, conflict between water and fire, leading to certain death.</p>
<p>Attendant Zhu Nangaow suffered from a temporal abscess, with swelling and pain in the throat, worse in the afternoon. This was indicative of blood deficiency and dryness of the liver and gallbladder channels. I treated him with Si Wu Tang, adding Yuan Shen, Chai Hu, Jie Geng, and roasted Licorice, which resulted in recovery. Additionally, due to labor, he developed febrile chills, thirst, and sweating. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, omitting Chai and Sheng, and adding Wu Wei, Mai Dong, and roasted Ginger, which led to his healing.<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a><br>The governor of the province, Hu Tingqi, aged seventy, suffered from swelling and pain in his front, with his head also swollen. This was due to insufficient kidney water, excessive liver and gallbladder fire, and dry blood. He was treated with the Six-Flavor Pill in four doses, and the sores began to drain and healed. Later, due to inappropriate care, he experienced swelling, pain, fever, and thirst, with a pulse that was weak and large. This indicated damage to the spleen and stomach qi. He was treated with the Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi formula to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish the kidney and liver, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man suffered from swelling and pain accompanied by fever. He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, supplemented with Lianqiao (forsythia), Jin Yin Hua (honeysuckle), and Jie Geng (platycodon), in four doses, achieving resolution.</p>
<p>Another man developed swelling and pain on the hairline and had a fever after getting angry. He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Lianqiao, Jin Yin Hua, Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthes root), and Jie Geng in four doses, which resolved the swelling. However, he continued to have pain at the sore sites. He was treated with Xian Fang Huo Ming Decoction in two doses, which stopped the pain and allowed the pus to form. After being needled, he was given a dispersing and detoxifying herbal formula to complete the healing.</p>
<p>A man with swelling and pain in his head and face during mid-winter presented with a taut and tight pulse. He was treated with a warming and channel-opening decoction, which induced sweating and resolved the symptoms.</p>
<p>Another man had swelling and pain with chills and heat, and a rapid floating pulse. The Jing Fang Bai Du Powder was administered in two doses, which completely resolved the surface symptoms. Additional dispersing and detoxifying powder was used to alleviate the condition, resulting in stability.</p>
<p>Yet another man had mature pus that would not drain, causing swelling and pain. He was needled to stop the condition, and a dispersing and detoxifying powder was given, leading to recovery. Generally, when sores have pus that does not drain, this indicates deficiency of qi and blood. If not addressed properly, it can lead to prolonged illness.<a id="trans-396p" href="#orig-396p" class="marker">[396p]</a><br>A man experienced painful pus and vomiting with little appetite. After taking a dose of the Immortal Life-Reviving Decoction, he was relieved; then taking the Six Gentlemen Decoction, combined with Angelica, Platycodon, and Gleditsia Thorns, he resolved the issue and recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had clear pus that would not gather. He took the Tori Powder, along with Schisandra and Ophiopogon, which helped consolidate it.</p>
<p>An elderly man had swelling, pain, and fever, with clear pus causing thirst. His pulse was soft and thin, indicating a deficiency in both blood and qi, which needed to be supplemented. When he felt thirsty and feverish, he resorted to heat-clearing medications, which led to vomiting and reduced appetite. Upon requesting treatment again, he was given the Six Gentlemen Decoction for four doses, which stopped the vomiting and improved his intake. He continued with tonic herbs for over a month until he recovered. </p>
<p>In patients, the qi and blood of the organs fluctuate between deficiency and excess. Moreover, sometimes Yin symptoms resemble Yang, and Yang symptoms resemble Yin; therefore, one cannot categorically apply cooling agents just because of fever and thirst. One should usually treat the patient’s genuine qi deficiency and the pathogenic qi excess, prioritizing relief for obstructions while using detoxifying herbs as an adjunct. If the genuine qi is strong and the pathogenic qi weak, one may focus on detoxification with obstruction relief herbs as support. If the genuine qi is weak and the pathogenic qi strong, focusing solely on detoxifying will first harm stomach qi. It is better to start with the Immortal Life-Reviving Decoction and Tori Detoxification Powder or to apply moxibustion. Once the pathogenic qi retreats and the genuine qi is restored, one can adjust treatment accordingly.</p>
<p>In general, if the genuine qi is depleted, it leads to deficiency; if the pathogenic qi prevails, it results in excess. The genuine and the pathogenic cannot coexist; when one prevails, the other loses. The deficiency does not wait to be harmed; it becomes deficient on its own. For conditions like back or head swellings and pustules, especially when affecting the limbs, moxibustion must be used to draw out the accumulated toxins and relieve the stasis, and one must be cautious not to focus solely on detoxification. One should diagnose through pulse examination and discern accordingly to avoid errors.<a id="trans-397p" href="#orig-397p" class="marker">[397p]</a><br>A man experienced painful swelling and feverish chills; after taking ten Xuan powder, his condition worsened. Upon examination, his pulse was rapid and full, indicating that evil was present both externally and internally. A modified Jing Fang Bai Du powder was prescribed, adding Qinjiao, Lianhua, and Da Huang; he improved slightly. Further treatment with four doses of Jing Fang Bai Du powder resulted in complete resolution. Generally, cases of sores manifest as severe swelling and pain, alternating chills and fever, potential constipation, dark and scanty urination, and symptoms of anxiety and restlessness, all indicating the presence of pathogenic heat; nourishment should not be applied in such cases. </p>
<p>Dong Yuan stated that the onset of sores differentiates between external and internal causes, and treatment varies between cold and warmth. For external causes, warming agents should be used to clear the skin, while using cold medicines would draw the evil from the surface into the marrow. For internal causes, cold agents should be employed to promote elimination, and using warming agents would exacerbate bone marrow diseases that spread to the skin, leading to a combined sore, increasing toxicity and suffering significantly; it may lead to serious danger or even death.</p>
<p>In Yangzhou, Yu Huangmen, over thirty, suffered from a toxic swelling in the winter, with irritability and constipation, his pulse was full, attributed to wind-heat obstructing the gallbladder meridian. Ma Shi suggested for those with sores where heat obstructs the flow, a Da Huang decoction should be administered. One dose relieved his constipation and reduced the sore. Subsequently, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du powder, followed by ten Xuan powder with the addition of Tianhuafen and Jinyinhua, and after several doses, he was cured. </p>
<p>Da Zongbo Luo Gong had a painful swelling at the hairline behind his ear; his pulse was rapid. He was given Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with the addition of Jie Geng, Niubangzi, and Jinyinhua, and he recovered after four doses.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a><br>Zhao Yiren, over seventy years old, suffered from a severe ulcerated condition and painful swelling in her temples. She preferred coolness, had a strong pulse, and was constipated. Dong Yuan stated: those who are restless, drink cold, feel hot, have a strong pulse, and experience mental dullness are indicative of excess in the organs. Therefore, a dose of cooling medicine was given, and the swelling and pain subsided. Moreover, over thirty doses of detoxifying herbs were administered, leading to stabilization. If one were to prescribe tonics at her advanced age after such a condition, disaster would certainly ensue. </p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of Surgery&quot; states: a man with a brain ulcer for over ten days showed severe lesions, connected to both ears, with swelling in the neck, redness and heat, a floating and rapid pulse. Initially, two doses of Huanglian’s detoxifying powder were used to reduce the major issues, stabilizing the root; afterward, several doses of detoxifying powder were administered, and the ulcer was unexpectedly found to be necrotic. Upon checking his pulse, it was found to be floating and weak. When asking the patient, he revealed he was over fifty years old, had long struggled with progeny issues, and had a concubine, leading to excessive worry and overexertion, damaging his vital energy. Additionally, the ulcer presented large, could only erupt and not produce pus; thus, the complete tonifying soup was prescribed, adding Platycodon and Angelica dahurica, with triple doses each of Ginseng and Atractylodes. Furthermore, the mulberry wood moxibustion method was applied, performed twice daily, and the Zixia ointment was applied externally.<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a><br>A few days later, the patient’s head and face became swollen, with both eyes almost shut, and the condition appeared fearsome. Subsequently, it began to fester, producing pus, amounting to several liters by the month, enduring for half a month. Due to the previous medicine being ineffective, accompanied by inner restlessness, vexation in the five hearts, and gradually decreasing appetite, this was because the excessive pus and blood loss were symptoms of false heat due to deficiency, and a change was necessary. Therefore, a dose of Shengyu Decoction was given; when it did not take effect, another dose was given, adding two taels of prepared Aconite. This time it took effect, and all prior symptoms receded. Next, using Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction with added Mai Dong and Wu Wei, each being up to three taels, the patient was nurtured for over a month. Later, the necrosis of the cerebral bone led to pieces of flesh falling off, appearing disheveled and unseemly. Anyone who saw it could not help but nod in astonishment. There was concern that the necrosis was extensive and could not be replenished. Thus, every day in the congee, three taels of Ginseng were added to the meal to nourish the spleen essence. Eventually, the original qi gradually revived, and after regulating for four months, the patient recovered. A year later, he had a son to carry on the lineage. </p>
<p>A man suffered from a pustule for three days, with swelling and chills, and a frequent floating pulse. A dose of Jing Fang Bai Du San was given, which resolved the exterior symptoms. However, the swelling and pain persisted, threatening to fester. Therefore, the medicine Tofu Xiang Du San was used, which resolved the pus. Following that, Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction was used, adding Mai Dong and Wu Wei to consolidate and heal.<a id="trans-400p" href="#orig-400p" class="marker">[400p]</a><br>A man suffered from a swollen temple for five days, the size of a coin, with a red and lively appearance. This was due to damp heat in the liver channel. He was treated with seven strong moxibustions using hemp seeds and two doses of Gardenia Liver Clearing Decoction. The swelling slightly subsided, and a toad venom plaster was applied to the area. Additionally, a Chaihu Liver Clearing Decoction was prescribed, with added Bai Zhi, Huang Qi, and Tian Hua Fen, which was taken multiple times until the pus broke and the swelling disappeared, eventually resolving in half a month.</p>
<p>Another man suffered from thirst for three years and chills and fevers for half a month, believing himself to have malaria. Suddenly, a small sore appeared between his temples, which over three to four days became hard and dark, resembling grains, and was also accompanied by a strong, rapid pulse without force, indicating a depletion of water and excess of fire. The condition was difficult to heal, and he did not have the courage to seek treatment. After asking for medical help again, the doctor thought it was easy to treat. A needle was inserted into the swollen area to draw out some dark blood, and detoxifying medicine was prescribed. The next day, the swelling on the side began to improve. The doctor said the high swelling was a yang condition and easy to treat, which pleased the family. </p>
<p>Three days later, both the jaw and neck were swollen, and he was unable to eat. The doctor inserted the needle again, and his condition worsened with increasing confusion. Upon reviewing the situation again, the doctor stated: &quot;He is on the verge of death.&quot; However, this condition had not appeared until thirst had already set in, indicating kidney water was depleted. The external appearance was like grains, but it could still accommodate food internally. The color was purple-black, with failing energy and weakened blood, and the pulse was strong yet without strength, indicating internal depletion of vital energy. With such intervention, could he possibly survive? The family finally believed the doctor&#39;s words, but it was too late! He passed away after twenty-one days.<a id="trans-401p" href="#orig-401p" class="marker">[401p]</a><br>A man had swelling and pain for five or six days. He wished to resolve it internally and applied a cooling medicine externally while taking large doses of rhubarb to promote purging. After the swelling subsided, he developed chills, fever, nausea, and dry vomiting, with tension in his shoulders. Upon examination, his pulse was rapid and weak, indicating internal deficiency and toxic qi penetrating within, caused by an excess of cooling medicine. </p>
<p>According to Dong Yuan, the onset of sores and abscesses can be differentiated by internal and external causes, and treated with either cold or warm methods. For external causes, one should apply warming methods combined with internal tonification; using cold medicines for purging can damage the spleen and stomach, leading to internal deficiency and allowing external toxins to enter. For internal causes, one should use cooling methods to clear, but using warming medications can mistakenly drive toxins to the skin surface, leading to a combined sore, exacerbating the disease and increasing suffering. Mild cases may worsen, while severe cases can be fatal.</p>
<p>Since the previous condition was indeed due to excessive cooling medicine, two doses of Baizhong Decoction were given, and the vomiting completely stopped. Further doses of the Ten Perfect Tonics added with several doses of Angelica Dahurica gradually brought the sore back. Additionally, taking Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction intermittently helped as the pus was thick and corrosive for over two months, eventually causing the sore to close up.<a id="trans-402p" href="#orig-402p" class="marker">[402p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a hard swelling, cold and hot sensations, dry mouth, and painful heat, with a strong and forceful pulse, indicating a condition of solid interior and exterior. A dose of Fangfeng Tongsan was administered twice, and her symptoms slightly improved; with another dose taken several times, the heat subsided and thirst ceased. However, for the original sore and hard swelling, a silver needle was used to puncture it, and a piece of toad venom was inserted. An internal formula to clear toxic heat was gradually administered until the pus was expelled and she felt at ease.</p>
<p>A man suffered for three or four days; his crown was swollen but there were no exterior or interior symptoms. This was an issue of damp-heat in the liver channel. A needle was used to pierce the sore&#39;s top, with a toad venom cake applied over it. He took an internal remedy of modified Xiao Yao San combined with a few doses of soap fruit. Initially, some pus appeared at the top, and the swelling decreased.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jingyue Quanshu&quot; states: &quot;The late Duke Shoufeng, in his youth, enjoyed drinking a lot, which led to his drinking illness. After he turned forty, he stopped drinking altogether but, at the age of seventy, during New Year&#39;s Eve celebrations, he drank a small cup and subsequently felt dizzy and unable to rise in the morning. The Duke was adept at emesis, as recorded in the section on phlegm and drink. He induced vomiting to expel the clear phlegm, and the dizziness quickly resolved. The underlying issue was that one cup of wine, how could it suddenly cause phlegm? It was merely due to the foul nature of the alcohol, and being affected by the wine fumes disrupted the true yin and pure qi. By expelling the phlegm and drink, the influence of the wine could be negated. Vomiting can elevate qi and restore clear yang. This is not merely treating phlegm but fundamentally correcting the disorder, and that is the intended meaning shared here.&quot;<a id="trans-403p" href="#orig-403p" class="marker">[403p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　头重何因得之？曰：因天之湿淫外着也，因人之湿痰上蒸也。因在下之阴气逆于上也，皆得而头重。何以言之？头象于天，其气极清。地气重浊，地者阴也，土湿也。若外着内蒸，必壅蔽清道，致气血不利，沉滞于经隧脉络，故重。《内经》曰：阳气者，因于湿，首如裹，是外湿蔽著者也。又曰：脾热病者，先头重，是胃脉引其热上于头也。<a id="orig-131p" href="#trans-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>　　　　　头摇</p>

<p>　　眩，谓眼黑眩也。运，如运转之运，世谓之头旋是也。　　《内经》论眩，皆属肝木，属上虚。丹溪论眩，主于补虚，治痰降火。仲景治眩，亦以痰饮为先也。　　赵以德曰：丹溪先生主火而言者，道也。然道无所之而不在。道之谓何？阴阳水火是也。其顺净清谧者，水之化；动扰挠乱者，火之用也。脑者，地气之所生，故藏于阴。目之瞳子，亦肾水至阴所主。所以二者皆喜静谧而恶动扰。静谧则清明内持，动扰则掉扰散乱，是故脑转目眩者，皆由火也。<a id="orig-133p" href="#trans-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>《灵枢》曰：五脏六腑之精气，皆上注目而为之精，筋骨血气之精与脉，并为目系，上属于脑后，出于项中。故邪中于项，因逢其身之虚，其入深，则随眼系以入于脑，入于脑则脑转，脑转则引目系急，目系急则目眩以转矣。所谓邪者，风寒湿热内外之诸邪也。然诸邪尽谓以火之所成。眩者何？《内经》谓诸风掉眩，皆属肝木者，是专言风邪矣。《原病式》释之曰：风火皆属阳，多为兼化，阳主乎动。两动相搏，则头目为之眩运而旋转。火本动也，焰得风则自然旋转，于是乎掉眩掉摇也。眩，昏乱旋运也。此非风邪之因火所成者欤？然风有内外，外入者兼火化者则如是。若内发者，尤是因火所生之风也。<a id="orig-134p" href="#trans-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>及诸篇中考之，有谓厥阴司天客胜，耳鸣掉眩，厥阴之胜者亦然。此司天之气，从上受者外入者也。又谓发生之纪，与岁木运太过，皆掉眩巅疾，善怒，肝肺太过，善忘，忽忽冒眩巅疾。又徇蒙招尤，过在足少阳厥阴者，言目瞤动蒙暗也。巢氏亦谓胁下痛头眩者，肝实也。此或得于肝脏应天气者所动，或因本脏虚实之气自动，皆名之为风，非火之烈焰，何能上于巅也？至于木郁之发，甚则耳鸣眩转，目不识人，善暴僵仆者，尤是肝木中火发之甚也。此天气内应于脏，与肝虚实之气动者，是皆名内发之风者也。<a id="orig-135p" href="#trans-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>又谓太阳之胜，热反上行，头项顶脑中痛，目如脱，注文谓寒气凌逼，阳不胜之，太阳之气，标在于巅，入络于脑故病如是。谓太阳司天善悲时眩仆。《灵枢》谓邪在心者，病亦同。二者皆是邪逼于心下，致神忐不安则悲，心火不行则妄动上炎。谓太阴之复，阴气上厥，饮发于中，头项胸痛而掉瘈尤甚，注文谓湿气内逆，寒气不行，太阳上留，故为是病。谓太阴在泉，病冲头痛，目似脱，注文云，亦是足太阳病也。谓太阴司天，头项痛，善眩，《灵枢》谓邪在肾颈项，时眩，此皆湿邪害肾，逼太阳之气，留于上而然也。至于《金匮要略》谓心下有支饮，其人苦冒眩者，亦是格其心火不行而上冲也。<a id="orig-136p" href="#trans-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>谓尺脉浮为伤肾，趺阳脉紧为伤脾，风寒相搏，食谷即眩；谓阳明脉迟，食难用饱。饱则发烦头眩。二者因脾胃虚而阳气不足，所以外见迟紧之脉，内受湿饮之郁，而不足之微阳，始与所郁之热，并而冲上于头目也。用此比类言之。则眩运之病，非一邪而可终。若夫太乙天真元气，皆得胃脘之阳，以行于周身，分三阴三阳之经脉，六气应天之阴阳，运行于表者，谓之六化，布五行于五脏属之气，应地之阴阳，运行于里者，谓之五阳。<a id="orig-137p" href="#trans-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>虽然，表里固分为二，及乎一经合一脏相通气而行，则表里必似二而一，一而二者也，悉如其天之有德有化，有用有变，于气交者，备在身形之中。经曰：成败倚伏，皆生于动。动之清静则生化治，动之躁乱则苛疾起。自此言之，掉眩由人气所动者，岂止如《金匮》所云湿饮而已？若此五阳六化妄动而病者，又可胜数哉？且夫凡有过节，即随其所动经脏之气而妄起，因名曰厥阳之火。厥阳之火有五，谓之五邪。五邪之变遂，胜克之病作。又或肾水不足，或精血伤败，不能制其五阳之火独光，或中土虚衰，不能堤防下气之逆，则龙雷之火，得以震动于巅。诸火上至于头重则搏击为痛，轻则旋转为眩运矣。夫如是比类之道，在经有之。<a id="orig-138p" href="#trans-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>诸治病循法守度，援物比类，化之冥冥，循上及下，何必守经。不引比类，是知不明也。其此之谓欤？或曰：治诸邪当何如？曰：夫火因动而起，但各从其所动之因而治之：因实热而动者，治其热；因邪搏击而动者，治其邪。因厥逆逼上者，下治所厥之邪。因阴虚而起者，补其阴，抑其阳，按而收之。因阳虚而气浮上者，则补其阳，敛其浮游之气。因五志而动者，各安其脏气以平之。因郁而发者，治其所郁之邪，开之发之。因精血不足者，补之不已，则求其属以衰之。因胜克而动者，从胜衰之气而补泻之。中气虚衰而动者，补其土以安之。<a id="orig-139p" href="#trans-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>上焦清明之气虚，不能主持而动者，亦当补中焦之谷气，推而扬之。因五脏六腑上注之精气不足而动者，察其何者之虚而补之。如是虽不专治其火而火自息矣。凡治百病之由火而生者皆然，非唯掉眩而已。严氏云：外感六淫，内伤七情，皆能眩运，当以脉证辨之。　　风则脉浮有汗，项强不仁，局方消风散、本事川芎散、羚羊角散、都梁丸、青州白丸子。　　寒则脉紧无汗，筋挛掣痛，不换金正气散加芎、芷、白芍药，甚贴姜附汤，济生三五七散。　　暑则脉洪大而虚，自汗烦闷，黄连香薷饮、十味香薷饮、消暑丸。湿则脉细沉重，吐逆涎沫，肾着汤加川芎名除湿汤、渗湿汤、济生芎朮散。　　风热，羌活汤、钩藤散。<a id="orig-140p" href="#trans-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>　　寒湿，芎朮除眩汤，或理中汤，仍吞来复丹，甚者养正丹。　　七情相干，眩运欲倒，用十四友丸、安肾丸二药夹和。以和剂七气汤送下，仍间用乳香泡汤下。　　有气虚者，乃清气不能上升，或汗多亡阳所致，当升阳补气，黄芪、人参，白朮、川芎、当归、甘菊花、柴胡、升麻之类。《直指方》云，淫欲过度，肾家不能纳气归元，使诸气逆奔而上，此眩运出于气虚也，宜益气补肾汤。　　有血虚者，乃因亡血过多，阳无所附而然，当益气补血芎归汤之类。　　中脘伏痰，呕逆眩运，旋覆花汤主之。《金匮》方：卒呕吐，心下痞，膈间有水，眩悸者，半夏加茯苓汤主之。假令瘦人脐下有悸，吐涎沫而头眩，此水也，五苓散主之。<a id="orig-141p" href="#trans-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>又云：心下有支饮，其人苦冒眩，泽泻白朮汤主之。泽泻五两，白朮二两，水二升，煮一升，分温再服。支饮之证，短气倚息，形如肿是也。痰闭不出者吐之。　　青黛散，(口畜)鼻取涎，治眩神效。　　头风眩运，可用独圣散吐之。吐讫，可用清上辛凉之药，防风通圣散，加半夏等味。仲景云：此痰结胸中而致也。　　大小便结滞者，微利之，河间搜风丸。　　体虚有寒者温之。仲景云：风虚头重眩，苦极不知食味，暖肌补中益精气，白朮附子汤主之。　　肝厥，状如癎疾，不醒，呕吐，醒后，头虚运发热，用麻黄、钩藤皮、石膏、干葛、半夏曲、柴胡、甘草、枳壳、甘菊为粗末，每服四钱，水一锺半，生姜三片，枣一枚，同煎至八分，去渣温服。<a id="orig-142p" href="#trans-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>　　　　　百会疽</p>

<p>　　常治法者，谓以常法而治之者也。如人病头疼，则以头疼常法治之是也。何必头疼而治之于两足乎？虽头疼实有治之两足而愈者，然彼必常治之而不愈，然后以变法治之，非可以舍常法而先求之于变法也。故一遇头疼，即以川芎五钱，白芷、蔓荆子、甘草、半夏、细辛各一钱治之，病去如扫也。　　上治者，治上焦之证也。如头疼而风入太阳经也。用川芎、细辛、白芷、柴胡、半夏、甘草各一钱，芍药三钱治之。盖风虽犯太阳，治法不可全治太阳，当上清其邪。故用白芷、川芎、细辛三味以散之；又用白芍、甘草、柴胡、以清肝胆之火，胆经与肝经入于头络，故用此数味以散邪去火；又加半夏去痰，甘草和中，相济而有成也。又头痛一方，用川芎一两，蔓荆子二钱，水煎服立愈。<a id="orig-172p" href="#trans-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>盖川芎补血，蔓荆子去风也。　　完治者，如病头疼脑痛，不必支刀破囫囵而治之也。头痛用黄酒一升，入细辛一两，白芷一两，煮酒，一醉而愈。　　此等治法，世人不知，亦不敢用，今为开导之。头痛至终年累月，其邪深入于脑，可知一二钱之散药，安能上至巅顶，而深入于脑中？必多用细辛、川芎、白芷以大散之也。或疑散药太多，必损真气，恐头痛未除而真气先行散尽。谁知风邪在头，非多用风药，必难成功。有病则病受之，何畏哉？一醉而愈。此方信而不必疑者也。惟是既愈之后，必须用熟地、芍药、当归各五钱，川芎一钱，山茱萸、麦门冬各三钱，水煎服四剂为妙。　　如人病头痛者，人以为风在头，不知非风也，亦肾水不足而邪火冲入于脑，终朝头运，似头痛而非头痛也。<a id="orig-173p" href="#trans-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>若只治风，则痛更甚。法当大补肾水，而头痛头运自除。方用熟地、葳蕤各一两，山茱萸四钱，北五味、麦冬各二钱，元参、川芎、当归、山药各三钱，二剂即愈。此方妙在治肾而不治风，尤妙在治肾而兼治肝也。肝木不平，则肺金失化源之令，而肾水愈衰。今补肝又补肾，子母相资，自然上清头目。况又入麦冬、五味，以滋肺金之清肃乎？所以下喉即安然也。　　头痛有神方，用川芎、沙参各一两，蔓荆二钱，细辛五钱，水二碗，煎八分，加黄酒半碗，调匀早晨服之，一剂永不再疼。此方妙在用沙参，盖沙参补阴，原不入脑，今用于川芎之中，而蔓荆、细辛，直走于巅，则沙参不能下行，不得不同群共入于脑中。夫脑痛者，因脑阴之虚风，得留之而不去。<a id="orig-174p" href="#trans-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>今补其脑则风不能存，而脑痛自愈，而头痛亦除矣。此方不特治头痛，兼治脑疼，无不神效。　　头痛之证，止消用蓖麻子一粒捣碎，同枣肉些须同捣匀，丸如黄豆大，外用丝绵裹之，纳入鼻孔，少顷必有清涕流出，即将丸药取出，不可久放其中，头疼即愈，永不再发。倘久留在中，必致脑髓流出，又成不可药救之证，切记切记！　　如人头疼，法当用轻清之口，少少散之，无不立效，如小柴胡汤之方是也。然而小柴胡汤，世人不知轻重之法，予再酌定之，可永为式。方用柴胡、黄芩、半夏、甘草各一钱，人参五分，此小柴胡汤。予更加人参五分，茯苓二钱，更为奇妙，盖气足则邪易出而汗易发。世人见用人参，便加失色，匪独医者不敢用，即病者亦不敢服，相沿而不可救药者，滔滔皆是。安得布告天下医人，详察其病源而善用之也！<a id="orig-175p" href="#trans-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>　　　　　脑痛治法</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>Spring Qi manifests as illness in the head.<br>[<em>Note: The term &quot;Qi&quot; refers to the energies of the four seasons and the five organs, which can lead to illness. The liver&#39;s influence is in the neck, while the spring Qi is in the head, as spring Qi rises and the Yang energy is upward, hence the illness related to Qi manifests in the head.</em>]</p>
<p><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of diagnosis, the Five Decisions serve as a record. To understand the beginning, first establish the source. The so-called Five Decisions refer to the five pulses. Therefore, if there is headache and vertex pain, there is deficiency below and excess above; it pertains to the foot Shaoyin and Taiyang, and if severe, it may go into the kidneys. [<em>Note: The beginning refers to the onset of pathogenic influence in the three Yin and three Yang channels. The Five Decisions involve discerning the Yin and Yang energies of the five organs to determine disease. To know the origin of a disease, first separate the five organs as the foundation, examine the pathogenic effects in relation to specific channels, and the corresponding organ channel. Shaoyin and Taiyang are interrelated; Yang Qi originates in the water organ and water viscera and ascends to the vertex. &quot;Excess&quot; indicates the presence of pathogenic influence, while &quot;deficiency&quot; indicates the correct Qi is weak. Hence, headache and vertex pain arise because pathogenic Qi is strong above and the correct Qi is weak below. Pathogenic influences begin in the superficial layers; if they linger, they transition into the channels, hence affecting the Taiyang and Shaoyin channels. If severe, it involves the kidneys; if the channels are affected, then the internal organs are disturbed.</em>] Heart distress and headache indicate illness in the diaphragm, affecting the hand Taiyang and Shaoyin.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> The heart is affected by external influences; when the fire energy of the heart encounters evil, it becomes disturbed internally. When the sun&#39;s energy is affected by evil, headaches occur in the upper part. The hand&#39;s sun channel runs through the throat and down to the diaphragm, while the hand&#39;s lesser yin channel emerges from the heart and connects to the diaphragm and small intestine. When there is an issue in the diaphragm, it indicates problems in the hand&#39;s sun and lesser yin channels.</p>
<p>When the green pulse is prominent, it is long and bouncy. If there is accumulated energy below the heart, it signifies a condition called liver phlegm. This arises from cold dampness and is treated similarly to hernias. Symptoms include lower back pain, cold feet, and headaches.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pulse is long and bouncy, tight and urgent. A tight pulse indicates a deficiency, while urgency points to cold. This results from cold dampness affecting the yang energy, causing a tight and urgent pulse. The area below the heart corresponds to the diaphragm, while below the ribs corresponds to the sides. When evil is between the diaphragm and the ribs, the pulse shows bounciness to the left and right. For individuals experiencing cold dampness, the treatment must start from the feet. The lesser yin pulse travels from the feet up through the back of the knees into the hair, passing the genital area, reaching the lower abdomen, and spreading across the sides, thus indicating symptoms similar to hernia pain, along with lower back pain and cold feet. The lesser yin and governor vessels meet at the apex, leading to headaches.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>For those suffering from liver disease, pain is felt under the ribs and extends to the lower abdomen, leading to irritability.

When qi is reversed, there are headaches, deafness, and swelling of the cheeks. </p>

The liver meridians run along the sides and connect to the lower abdomen, which is why there is pain under the ribs extending to the lower abdomen. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that when liver qi is excessive, it leads to anger. The liver stores blood and opens to the eyes; therefore, deficiency leads to impaired vision. The Shaoyang meridian enters the ear, hence the inability to hear. For those with gallbladder disease, there is a feeling of emptiness below the heart, as if one is being captured. The Jueyin and Governing Vessel meet at the crown, causing headaches from reversed liver qi, while reversed Shaoyang qi causes deafness and swelling of the cheeks.</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Exposition on the Five Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the five evils disturb the body, if the evil enters the yang, it causes madness; if it enters the yin, it causes stagnation. If it assaults the yang, it results in headaches; if it assaults the yin, it results in muteness.</p>

When the evil enters the yin, it becomes blocked and stagnant, resulting in pain. If the evil qi collides with yang qi above, it causes headaches. The Shaoyin channel connects to the tongue, linking to the coccyx and ending at the epiglottis. If the evil collides with the yin, it obstructs the epiglottis from functioning, causing one to be unable to swallow and thus leading to muteness.</em>]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Theory of Reality and Illusion</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: If the pulse is strong and full, the hands and feet are cold, and the head is hot, what does this indicate? Qi Bo replied: In spring and autumn, life arises; in winter and summer, death occurs. If the pulse is floating and weak, and if it is weak with heat in the body, this indicates death. The Emperor asked: What if the form is entirely full? Qi Bo replied: When the form is entirely full, the pulse is rapid, large, and firm, with a weak Chi at the wrist that does not respond. In such cases, if one follows it, there will be life; if one opposes it, there will be death. The Emperor asked: What does it mean that following brings life and opposing brings death? Qi Bo replied: Following means that the hands and feet are warm. Opposing means that the hands and feet are cold. </p>
<p>[Note: The kidneys govern the origin of vital energy, and the bladder is associated with the sun&#39;s yin. A strong and full pulse indicates that the cold energy of the lesser yin permeates outward. Cold hands and feet suggest that the life force of the lesser yin is deficient within. A hot head indicates an excess of the sun&#39;s energy rising above. The interplay of yin and yang between the kidneys and bladder governs vital energy; when this is abundant externally, it leads to deficiency internally. In spring, yang energy slightly rises while yin energy slightly descends; in autumn, yin energy slightly rises while yang energy slightly descends. These two energies nourish and support each other, hence sustaining life. In winter, the external expression of yin energy is complete; in summer, the internal expression of yang energy is fully weak, hence leading to death. This indicates the essential vitality of yin and yang, which must not be allowed to become depleted.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of liver heat disease, the first sign is yellow urine, with abdominal pain leading to excessive lying down and a feeling of body heat; when the heat conflicts, there are wild words and fright, fullness and pain in the sides, restlessness in the hands and feet, and an inability to lie peacefully. If the heat is severe, there will be significant sweating. If the qi goes against the flow, it can lead to death. Should it reverse, there will be a heavy headache. The pulse rises to the head.</p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the heat originating from internal causes. &quot;First&quot; refers to the initial presence of such internal heat manifested in these symptoms. The liver is responsible for regulation, thus the yellow urine. The liver channel connects to the lower abdomen, hence the abdominal pain. The liver houses the soul, and if the soul is harmed, it leads to excessive lying down; since wood and fire are responsible for qi, there is body heat. This indicates an internal disease starting in the qi level, moving from inside to outside, and being influenced by external pathogens, affecting the five organs and contending with internal heat, leading to harm to the soul and wild words, since the liver houses the soul. The liver, associated with the east and wood, manifests through fright. The liver channel runs through the sides, hence the fullness and pain there. If the wind and heat of wood are strong, it leads to restlessness in the limbs. When a person lies down, blood returns to the liver; if the liver qi is damaged and cannot accept the blood, it results in an inability to lie down.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The metal of Geng and Xin controls the wood of the liver, which is why it is so harsh. Geng and Xin do not perish; they begin with Jia and Yi. When there is great sweating, it indicates a proper defeat of the邪 (pathogenic factor) that is expelled outward. When qi is rebellious, it means the heat is excessive and turns inward, causing repression. The term &quot;yuan yuan&quot; signifies circulation. The heat of the liver manifests outwardly and corresponds with the body&#39;s heat; when the heat is excessive, it reverses upwards to the head, resulting in headaches and circular sensations. Indeed, the three yang channels ascend to the head, where the heat of the liver conflicts with the lesser yang, causing the pulse to force upwards to the head.</p>
<p>In cases of heart heat disease, there is initially a lack of joy, followed by several days of heat. When the heat contends, sudden heart pain arises, along with restlessness, tendency to vomit, headache, reddening of the face, and absence of sweating. When Ren and Gui are severe, and Bing and Ding are in great sweat, if qi rebels, then Ren and Gui perish.</p>
<p>Note: The heart’s will is joy, and fear can overcome it. A lack of initial joy suggests injury from fear. This indicates inner heat affected by external邪, causing internal conflicts. The heat dries out the spirit and the heart, resulting in sudden distress and pain. In cases of lesser yin disease, there is a desire to vomit but little ability to do so, hence the tendency to retch. The heart is the sun among the yang, thereby causing headaches. The radiance of the heart is reflected in the face, hence the reddening. The heart governs blood, which explains the absence of sweating.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: What causes pain when there is heat in the body? Qi Bo replied: Heat in the body is due to the Yang channels, arising from the movement of the Three Yangs. The pulse at the wrist shows a strong Shaoyang, a very strong Taiyang, and a strong Yangming, indicating an entry into Yin. When Yang enters Yin, the illness manifests in the head and abdomen, causing distention in the abdomen and headache.</p>
<p><strong>[Note</strong>: Heat in the body signifies the prevalence of Yang channels. When Yang channels are strong, it is the movement of the Three Yangs that causes illness. When all three Yangs are strong, they dominate the condition of heat and headache. The abdomen is Yin, and within Yin, the most Yin is the spleen. As Yang enters Yin, the illness affects the head and abdomen, thus leading to abdominal distention and headache. The essence is that Yang entering Yin concerns the energy of the Three Yangs, not the meridians of the Three Yangs. If the illness is in the meridians and descends to the inner Yin, there would be pain without distention. In this case, the illness is in the Qi phase, and Yang energy enters the abdomen, resulting in distention without pain.]**<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>When the wind energy ascends from the Wind Palace, it can lead to “brain wind.” If the wind enters and affects the head, this results in “eye wind” causing coldness in the eyes. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The Wind Palace refers to an acupuncture point located at the back of the neck, which connects to the governing vessel, a meeting point of yang energy, thus the wind energy reaching the Wind Palace and following the meridians leads to brain wind. The foot yang channels communicate with the brain, which relates to the eyes; this is called eye connection. Since the foot yang associated with cold water governs energy, this leads to eye coldness.]</strong></p>
<p>When one is freshly bathed and encounters wind, it causes “head wind.” The symptoms of head wind include excessive sweating on the head and face, a dislike of wind; if exposed to wind for one day, the illness worsens, and one suffers from headaches that prevent them from leaving the house. When the day of wind arrives, the illness tends to improve.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: To bathe is to wash the head with water. After a fresh wash, the hair follicles open, so when wind enters the skin of the head, it results in head wind. The head is the meeting place of various yang energies; thus, when freshly bathed, the skin on the head is relaxed, which allows for excessive sweating and a dislike of wind. Wind represents the celestial yang energy and the human yang energy; in response to the heavenly wind, the various yang energies emit from the head. Therefore, if the exposure occurs one day prior, the illness worsens, as the wind is about to manifest and the energy becomes ill. On the day the wind manifests, the energy disperses with the wind, hence the illness improves a little.]</strong><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: If a person suffers from headaches that do not cease for several years, what could be the cause of this? What is the name of this illness? Qi Bo replied: This is due to an offense against great cold, penetrating to the bone marrow. The marrow is primarily associated with the brain; when the brain is affected, it results in headaches and tooth pain. The illness is termed &quot;Jue Ni&quot; (Counterflow).</p>
<p>[This discusses the illness of the brain and marrow. On Earth, it corresponds to water; in the heavens, it corresponds to cold. Cold produces water, water produces salinity, and salinity nourishes the kidneys, which in turn create the bone marrow. Therefore, due to the offense of great cold penetrating to the bone marrow, all marrow is associated with the brain, hence the brain is considered the main organ. When the evil of the marrow rises against the brain, it causes persistent headaches for several years. Teeth are the extensions of the bones, thus they also experience pain. Cold enters from below and rises to the top, hence it is termed &quot;Counterflow.&quot;]</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding the discussion on pulses:</p>
<p>The Yangming so-called &quot;Guest Sun Pulse,&quot; indicates that when headaches, nasal obstruction, and abdominal swelling occur, Yangming is concentrated above. The above pertains to its Sun collateral branch linked to the Taiyin. Hence, there are headaches, nasal obstruction, and abdominal swelling. </p>
<p>[Note: This exemplifies the dynamics of Yin and Yang, as well as the rise and fall of energies, and the internal and external exchanges flowing in the pulse&#39;s external energy level. The energy level refers to the space between the skin and muscles. &quot;Above&quot; refers to the external surface of the skin. All the pulses represented as floating and commonly observed are collateral pulses. The pulse of Foot Taiyin also appears on the skin&#39;s surface without concealment. Therefore, when the Yangming energy converges at the top, it exerts pressure on the collateral of Yangming, linking with the Taiyin meridian. When pressured by Yangming&#39;s Sun collateral, headaches and nasal obstruction occur, and abdominal swelling is due to pressure from the Taiyin meridian.]<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Variations of Qi and Its Effects</strong></p>
<p>When the energy of wood is excessively strong in the year, the wind energy circulates widely, affecting the earth element, causing the people to suffer from symptoms such as diarrhea, reduced appetite, heaviness and discomfort in the body, rumbling intestines, and a full abdomen. This corresponds to the star of the year. In severe cases, there may be sudden anger and symptoms like dizziness and head ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the energy of wood is too strong, it overwhelms the earth element, leading to ailments of the spleen. Symptoms like diarrhea, reduced appetite, abdominal rumbling, and fullness are all indicative of spleen disorders. The spleen governs the muscles and limbs, hence the heaviness and discomfort. This is due to the earth being harmed and unable to control water, causing water energy to rise and affect the heart. The star of the year refers to Jupiter, which influences wood. Excessive wood energy corresponds to the years of the Ren. If too much is in excess, it ultimately harms oneself. Sudden anger indicates a disturbance of the liver’s energy. The Jueyin and the Governor Vessel converge at the crown of the head, hence the symptoms of dizziness and head ailments.</p>
<p>When the energy of metal is insufficient in the year, the fire energy prevails, leading to the stagnation of the yin, causing the yang to become excessive. Symptoms include pain in the head and temples, extending to warmth at the crown, along with mouth sores and, in severe cases, heart pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the years of Liu Yi, the energy of metal is insufficient, allowing the fire energy that it should control to prevail. When metal is weak and fire is excessive, water is consequently restored. During autumn and winter, the yang energy is supposed to be stored in the yin organs. However, due to the reversal of cold energy, the yang becomes stagnant externally, which causes the yang to ascend, resulting in head pain and warmth at the crown. The cold water energy rises and forces the heart fire outward, leading to the people suffering from mouth sores and, in severe cases, heart pain.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: The Five Movements refers to the transformations of the five elements. The years of Chen and Xu govern the emergence of Great Yang energy.

<p>(Note: When the Taiyin is in the springs, it refers to the years of Chen and Xu. It governs the nourishment of plants, hence the early blooming of grass. Yellow represents the color of earth, and black the color of water; since earth overcomes dampness, yellow appears as black.

The bladder is the organ of water’s essence; when the earth qi overwhelms dampness, both the water organs and passages become ill.)</p>
<p>When the Taiyin governs the heavens and dampness prevails, there are symptoms of swelling, bone pain, and yin obstruction. Yin obstruction means that pressure cannot alleviate it, resulting in pain in the lower back, spine, head, and neck, accompanied by dizziness and difficulty in defecation. </p>
<p>(Note: When the Taiyin governs the heavens, it refers to the years of Chou and Wei. Swelling and yin obstruction result from exposure to cold and damp qi. When the illness pertains to yin, it is called obstruction, hence it cannot be alleviated by pressure. The kidneys govern bones and the bladder is their organ; thus, pain occurs in the lower back, spine, and head. The kidneys open to the two yin, which explains the difficulty in defecation.)</p>
<p>When the Shaoyang governs the heavens and fire prevails, the people suffer from headaches, fever, and chills, as well as intermittent fever. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fire of the lesser yang, manifests as heat in the heavens, causing the people to suffer from headaches, chills, fevers, and intermittent fevers. The greater yang controls the heavens; when the cold overcomes, the blood alters internally, resulting in abscesses. People suffer from heart pain, vomiting blood, blood-related disorders, sneezing, nosebleeds, and frequent fainting spells. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How do the six energies interact? Qibo replied: The dominance of the jueyin leads to tinnitus, dizziness, a sensation of wanting to vomit, cold in the stomach, and frequent strong winds.</p>
<p>The three yin and three yang govern the seasonal energies; when an excess leads to illness among the people, it is prudent to balance it with the corresponding flavors. Tinnitus and dizziness relate to the ascending wood energy. Nausea indicates cold in the stomach, hence the stomach&#39;s disturbance. Frequent strong winds indicate an excess below trying to rise.</p>
<p>The dominance of the taiyin results in internal fire stagnation, ulcers developing internally and spreading outward, with ailments in the sides and ribs, leading to severe heart pain, hot sensations, headaches, throat constriction, and stiff neck. Pure domination brings dampness to stagnate internally and cold that presses on the lower body, causing pain that lingers at the crown, drawing tight between the eyebrows, fullness in the stomach, warmth in the feet, heaviness of the head, and swelling of the lower legs. </p>
<p>Fluid accumulation emerges internally, resulting in swelling above. The return of the taiyin transforms dampness leading to heaviness and fullness in the body, leading to indigestion and upward disruption of yin energy.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: When external dampness pervades, internal fire becomes constrained and leads to sores within. When damp-heat spreads outward, it reaches the wind and wood, causing illness in the ribs and flanks. If it worsens, it can result in heart pain as wood overwhelms and transmits to fire. Heat causes headaches, throat constriction, and neck stiffness, as the air of wind and fire mixes with dampness, rising from the neck to the crown. This dominance arises from excessive dampness persisting for a year and a half. </p>
<p>Dampness in the center drives internal pressure downwards, causing pain that lingers at the crown and pulls between the eyebrows, as wind and fire linger at the crown and transmit to the Yangming channel, reaching the stomach and causing fullness. A warm head and heavy body below indicate that the wind and fire are flowing downwards. </p>
<p>Fluids accumulating within and swelling upwards are due to water rising from below through the center to the top. Furthermore, the energies of three Yin and three Yang being influenced by the dominating energies can cause a resurgence of repressed illness. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the Taiyang (greater yang) phase returns, its qi rises upwards. The heart and stomach become cold, the chest and diaphragm are obstructed, leading to heart pain and fullness; headaches accompanied by sadness occur, and at times one may feel dizzy and faint. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The cold water qi of Taiyang prevails, thus causing congestion and arriving at its peak. The heat rising upwards indicates that Taiyang&#39;s qi rises through the meridians to enter the brain and then emerges again from the lower neck. The qi rising upwards signifies stagnated qi that ascends, desiring to revert to the condition before mid-year. The cold in the heart and stomach, obstruction of the chest and diaphragm, heart pain and fullness, headaches with sadness, and occasional dizziness, result from the upward movement of qi that starts from below, moves to the center, and then ascends.</p>
<p>When the Yangming (bright yang) phase returns, the clear qi surges strongly. Illness manifests as pain in the flanks, with qi returning to the left side, often leading to deep sighing; in severe cases, there is heart pain and fullness, abdominal distension and diarrhea, bitterness in vomiting, cough and vexation, with illness in the lower abdomen, accompanied by headaches.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The return of Yangming occurs at the time when its governing forces are in place; thus, illness arises in the flanks, with qi returning to the left, as metal surpasses wood. Heart pain, fullness, abdominal swelling, and diarrhea occur as fire overcomes earth. Those with gallbladder issues tend to sigh deeply. Bitter vomiting occurs when wood bears the punishment of metal, and organs may also be affected. Coughing and vexation indicate the qi of the lungs is in rebellion. The painful cough and mental vexation signify that the illness is within the lower abdomen, while headaches relate to Jueyin (reverting yin) disorders.</p>

<p>When the lesser yang governs the heavens, if the guest energy is dominant, this will lead to rashes on the skin, skin boils, nausea, throat obstruction, and headaches. The initial qi of the lesser yang consists of the two fires of the lord and minister; the second qi is the damp earth of the greater yin. The skin rashes are caused by heat manifesting outwardly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Composure</strong></p>
<p>The Thunder Lord said: Here there are those with headaches, muscle spasms, heavy bones, timorousness, and shortness of breath, who experience belching and abdominal fullness, and are startled at times, showing little desire to sleep. What organ causes this? The pulse is floating and string-like, palpated like stone; one does not understand the cause, and again inquires about the three organs to discern the relationship. The Emperor said: This is called composure. In older years, inquiry should go to the viscera; in youth, it should go to the channels; in adulthood, it should go to the organs. What you describe is all erroneous: the Eight Winds are causing damp heat, the Five Organs are deteriorating, and evil influences interact with each other. A floating and string-like pulse indicates kidney deficiency. A sinking and stone-like pulse indicates internal obstruction of kidney qi. Timorousness and shortness of breath indicate that the water pathway is not functioning well, leading to diminished vital energy. Coughing and vexation indicate the reversal of kidney qi. The essence of an individual’s qi resides in one organ. If one claims that all three organs are affected, it is contrary to the method. </p>
<p>[Note: The Jueyin root arises from the Dadu point, with qi connecting to the governing vessel at the vertex and governing the muscles, hence the headache and muscle spasms result from Jueyin channel pathology. The Shaoyin root arises from the Yongquan point, being the source of life qi and governing the bones, hence the heavy bones and shortness of breath result from Shaoyin channel pathology. The Taiyin root arises from the Yinbai point, linked to the stomach via membranes; thus belching and abdominal fullness, along with edginess and lack of sleep, result from Taiyin channel pathology. The floating pulse is an opening pulse. The string-like pulse is the pivot pulse; the stone-like pulse is the closing pulse. Since the Thunder Lord does not understand the cause, he inquires further about the pulse signs of the three organs to discern their relationships in obscurity.]<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The one who is composed is called &quot;qi,&quot; indicating that the meridians should seek it in qi. The three Yin are the elder female, middle female, and younger female. The太阴 (Great Yin) corresponds to the elder female, thus it should be sought in the Fu (organs), where yang predominates and opens. The少阴 (Lesser Yin) corresponds to the younger female, so it should be sought in the channels, where the qi internally connects to the organs and externally links to the body, governing the mechanisms of entry and exit. The厥阴 (Rebellious Yin) is located at the intersection of the two Yin, corresponding to the middle female, thus it is sought in the organs, where Yin prevails and governs closure. This corresponds to the qi of the three Yin, as seen in symptoms like headaches and muscle spasms. The pulse is floating and string-like, hence one should seek the opening and closing mechanisms of the three Yin qi. If one only discusses pulse symptoms, it does not reflect composure. The eight winds disperse heat, causing a person’s yang qi to circulate above, below, and on all sides. The five organs become consumed, allowing the transmission of pathogenic factors, described as the qi of the five elements, interconnected within the cosmos, with interactions of generation and overcoming. The floating and string-like pulse signifies the deficiency of the kidney qi arising from the liver and spleen. The sinking and stone-like pulse indicates that the qi of the liver and spleen descends to the kidney, marking the internal engagement of kidney qi. The water in the spring flows according to the qi in the heavens, thus those who are timid and low in qi experience blocked waterways, leading to the depletion of qi in the body. Coughing and restlessness indicate the upward reversal of kidney qi towards the heart and lungs. The three Yin of the five organs ultimately unify into one qi, which then connects and permeates through the five organs. Understanding the interplay of heaven&#39;s dao, where qi exchanges between Yin and Yang, is essential for following the composed middle path. If one claims that the liver, spleen, and kidney operate together, it does not conform to the principles of Yin and Yang&#39;s separation and combination.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Sea of Marrow</h3>
<p>The brain is the sea of marrow; its ascendant flow is at its crown, while the descendant flow is at the Wind Pool below. When the sea of marrow is abundant, one is light, vigorous, and strong, surpassing usual limits; when the sea of marrow is insufficient, there are dizzy spells, ringing in the ears, weakness in the legs, blurred vision, and a tendency to be lethargic and prone to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The brain, as the sea of marrow, receives energy that is constrained by it. Thus, its ascendant flow is at the crown, and the descent is at the Wind Pool in the Governing Vessel, connecting the sea of marrow above to the spiritual essence below. The essence nourishes the brain marrow and flows down to the Yin region; hence, when the sea of marrow is abundant, the legs are light and filled with strength. &quot;Limits&quot; refers to the capacity of the bones. Marrow travels from the bone cavities circling the limits upward to the brain; thus, when abundant, it transcends normal limits. If the sea of marrow is deficient, the bodily fluids deplete. The essential fluids are what moisten the openings; thus, the ears ring and vision fails. When liquids are depleted, the bones are impaired in flexibility, resulting in weak legs and a tendency towards fatigue and restfulness.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Five Disturbances</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: The twelve meridians correspond to the five elements and are divided into the four seasons. What leads to disorder? What brings about harmony? Qi Bo replied: The five elements are in order, the four seasons are distinct. When they are harmonized, there is order; when they are contrary, there is disorder. Therefore, if the Qi is disturbed in the heart, it leads to anxiety and silence, causing one to bow their head and remain still; if disturbed in the lungs, it leads to gasping and loud breathing, making one call for help; if disturbed in the intestines and stomach, it results in dysentery; if disturbed in the arms and legs, it causes syncope; if disturbed in the head, it leads to cessation of circulation, causing heaviness and dizziness.  </p>
<p><strong>The Great Delusion Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: I once ascended the cool and tranquil terrace, looking back and crawling forward, then became perplexed. I privately pondered this, secretly wondering about it. Alone in stillness, focusing my mind and calming my Qi, I remained perplexed for a long time. Alone in contemplation, feeling dizzy, with long hair disheveled, I knelt and looked down; afterward, it did not cease. Suddenly, from above, what Qi caused this? Qi Bo answered: The essence and Qi of the five organs and six viscera all ascend to the eyes, forming essence. They gather the essence of muscles, bones, and blood, merging with the meridians, ascending to the brain, and then exiting through the nape. Hence, when evil enters the nape and encounters one&#39;s physical void, if it penetrates deeply, it follows the eye&#39;s connection into the brain; once in the brain, the brain spins, and that causes the eyes to be urgently connected; when the eyes are urgently connected, they become dizzy and turn. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A pulse that beats four times in a breath is the &quot;peaceful pulse.&quot; If it beats three times with one breath and three times with one inhalation, that totals six beats in one breath, which is two beats more than a normal person, hence it is termed a slight illness, not severe.

<p><strong>Headache due to Cold</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse of the three Yang channels captures wind and cold which then lingers and does not disperse, it is called headache due to cold.</p>
<p><strong>True Headache</strong></p>
<p>When the pain is linked to the brain, it is termed true headache. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> True headache results in intense pain, penetrating the brain, leading to blue coloring of the hands and feet reaching the joints, and is fatal if untreated. The brain is considered the sea of marrow, where true Qi is concentrated; if it fails to resist pathogens, it will lead to death.</p>

<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>The teacher said: If the patient speaks in a sharp, fine, and drawn-out voice, there is pain in the head. In cases of Yang diseases, the eighteenth: headache, with pain in the neck, waist, spine, arms, and legs. If the pulse is tight, it indicates headache caused by wind and cold, and stagnation of undigested food in the abdomen. For those who experience dry heaving, vomiting foam, and headaches, the remedy is the Zhuyu Decoction. For those who are thirsty after vomiting, craving water, the remedy is the Wenguo Decoction, which also addresses mild wind pulse headache.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p>All joints and limbs are painful, the body feels weak and frail, the feet are swollen as if dislocated, there is dizziness and shortness of breath, a sensation of warmth that makes one want to vomit. The prescription for this is Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of lung atrophy with phlegm and frothy sputum but no cough, the patient is not thirsty and must urinate frequently. The reason for this is that the weakness above cannot control the excess below. This indicates cold in the lungs, causing excessive salivation and dizziness; use Gancao Ganjiang Decoction to warm it. If upon taking the decoction the patient feels thirsty, it is classified as diabetes.</p>
<p>If there is phlegm and fluid under the heart, fullness in the chest and sides, and dizziness, the prescription is Linggui Zhuyuan Decoction. If there is fluid under the heart and the person suffers from dizziness and a sensation of heaviness, the prescription is Zexie Decoction.</p>

<p>If a thin person experiences palpitations below the navel, vomits frothy saliva, and suffers from dizziness, it is due to water retention; Wuling Powder is the remedy.</p>
<p>A tight pulse at the foot yang point indicates spleen damage caused by the interplay of wind and cold. If food is consumed, dizziness occurs; if the digestive Qi is not dissipated, it remains stagnant in the stomach, causing foul and turbid sensations and obstructed urination.

<p>In cases where the pulse is slow in Yangming disease, it is difficult to eat until full; if full, there will be disturbance and dizziness, and urination will be difficult. This indicates the onset of grain jaundice; even if purged, the abdomen remains distended, because the pulse is slow. </p>
<p>The disease of grain jaundice manifests with cold and heat, loss of appetite, dizziness upon eating, and discomfort in the heart and chest. Prolonged symptoms leading to jaundice require treatment with Yinchenhao Decoction.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p>In a yellow-sick individual, fever appears in the afternoon followed by chills, which can arise from excessive labor in women.

<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headache that comes suddenly should be treated urgently; if it&#39;s due to wind and phlegm, it can easily be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions (by Sun Simiao from Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dizziness from Wind</strong></p>
<p>Xu Sibai said: The disease of dizziness from wind arises from unstable heart qi and accumulation of filth in the chest, which causes the sensation of a high wind and heat on the face. The interaction of phlegm and heat stirs the wind; when the wind and heart are in disarray, it results in confusion and dizziness, thus termed dizziness from wind. In adults, it is called mania, while in children it is termed epilepsy; essentially, they are the same. This prescription is sure to cure, but the concern is that if the symptoms are not properly assessed, it might lead to adverse outcomes. Generally, one should avoid eating all types of meat. Particularly, the consumption of pork may cause problems, leading to excessive gas and urgent respiratory difficulties, which can be fatal. Therefore, this decoction is suitable for both light and heavy conditions, and should not be dismissed hastily as non-serious. The prescribed remedies, including decoctions, powders, or pills can total ten varieties. For initial onset, it is advisable to administer the Sustained Life Decoction urgently. During an acute phase, one should promptly perform moxibustion on the acupoints and apply fire needles; there is no case of failure in recovery. Immediate needling should be followed by moxibustion for best results. The moxibustion methods will be listed afterward. Over the course of my thirty-plus years in practice, I have saved and revived countless patients, and all recovered. Future practitioners should understand this formula and avoid mixing it with my other techniques.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

<p>The symptoms of dizziness must be understood from both internal and external causes.</p>
<p>The <em>Suwen</em> states: All winds causing dizziness relate to the liver. Thus, it is known that liver wind attacking upwards must lead to dizziness. Dizziness is characterized by blurred vision and a sensation of spinning; when one rises, they feel faint. From this perspective, external six evils and internal seven emotions can both cause such conditions, and differentiation must be made between external signs and pulse. If affected by wind, the pulse is floating with sweating, and there is stiffness in the neck without sensation; if cold, the pulse is tight with no sweating, and there is cramping and pain in the muscles; if heat, the pulse is weak and there is restlessness; if dampness, the pulse is thin and heavy, with nausea and vomiting. </p>
<p>When affected by the seven emotions, it causes disharmony in the zàng organs, leading to phlegm production, which obstructs and causes rebellious qi, resulting in dizziness. This is accompanied by pain in the brow ridge and inability to open the eyes, along with a predominantly deep pulse, which indicates a different condition. </p>
<p>Moreover, excessive fatigue, deficiency in the lower regions and fullness in the upper, wounds leading to bleeding, or women experiencing blood loss during menstruation all result in dizziness. Each should be treated according to its cause; this is the effective method.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Headache Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>The head is where all the yang energies converge, while all the yin meridians reach the neck and return. Only the yang meridians ascend to the head, indicating that the head and face belong to the yang region. In ordinary individuals, when yang flows upwards without obstruction, there will be no headache. However, if yang flows upwards against the natural order, it congests in the head, resulting in headaches. </p>
<p>Headaches can arise from wind and cold in the brain, evil heat attacking upwards, phlegm or kidney blockage, and deficiencies or aggressive qi, all of which lead to pain. The methods for treatment have already been discussed. Yet, in cases of qi deficiency or aggressive qi, headaches may improve momentarily only to return after a period of time. </p>
<p>For skewed or intense headaches, women with abundant qi but deficient blood, especially after significant blood loss during childbirth, may suffer from headaches as there is insufficient qi to govern. The &quot;Scorpio Appendage Pill&quot; effectively treats headaches caused by qi deficiency and aggressive qi, marvelously fitting the principles of transformation and creation. </p>
<p>Among the ingredients used, Aconite is included to bolster yang and support deficiency, while the use of rosin helps to replenish yang and stabilize. The whole scorpion signifies the penetrating nature necessary for treatment, and the use of scallion juice promotes the smooth flow of qi. </p>
<p>In soups, the addition of pepper and salt serves a purpose: pepper aids in penetrating downwards, and salt helps draw the deficient qi downwards—applying these based on the symptoms leads to effective results.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment of Headache</h3>
<p>Headaches are associated with the upper, where the yang meridians converge. Typically, headaches indicate a deficiency of blood and qi. External pathogens like wind, cold, heat, and dampness can injure the yang channels, leading to what is called &quot;obstructive headache.&quot; Obstruction signifies something reversed; it congests and pressures the head. Severe pain that radiates to the crown and causes coldness in the hands and feet is termed &quot;true headache,&quot; which cannot be cured by medicine. There are also conditions of wind-heat phlegm obstruction, qi deficiency kidney obstruction, and exposure to wind after bathing, all of which can lead to headaches. The treatment method should focus on identifying the source and adjusting accordingly, with no possibility of missing the mark.</p>
<h3>Scalp Abscess</h3>
<p>Scalp abscesses occur when yang is trapped and toxins rise to obstruct. They may appear at the end of the occipital bone or at the Fengchi point. The size and severity can vary, appearing as hard swellings that can eventually break down and spread through the hair, producing pain as if cut by a knife, with redness and swelling but no pus. If it is stubborn, yellow fluid may emerge; if it flows well, white pus may form. Treatments include Angelica, Chuanxiong, ginseng, red peony, Forsythia, Platycodon, Tianhuafen, Cimicifuga, wine-fried Scutellaria, gardenia, honeysuckle, astragalus, and dried kudzu root, among others, to create a harmonious treatment. Topically, use Zijingting water for application. For larger abscesses, apply a plaster three times daily and consider taking wax alum pills.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This affliction appears at the back of the head. If it resembles a beehive, urgent measures should be taken to rescue the patient.

If it flows to both shoulders, do not attempt treatment. The method of treatment is the same as for scalp ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Zhenju (Phlegm Abscess)</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from wind-heat attacking the interior, causing this abscess disease. The remedy should be adjusted according to the patient&#39;s age.

It is advisable to take internal Huanglian Decoction with ten or so doses, plus Qianghuo, Jin Yinhua, and Jingjie; alternatively, one could use Qianjin Tuo Li San. Additionally, one should take Huangfan Pills and apply Jin Si Ointment externally. The treatment method is the same as for oral ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This poison results from kidney deficiency, with excessive heat blocking the brain&#39;s orifices and forming hidden toxicity. In the initial three days, shave the hair and use moxa the size of a bean for five treatments, applying surrounding medicines externally to help dispel it. Use Sanxiang Neituo San and Dingtong Xiaodu Yin for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Oral Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from deficient Yang attacking upwards, causing heat to infiltrate the brain, leading to the formation of this abscess. It is located near the throat, a gathering place of Yang, and requires appropriate regulation. For initial treatment, use Qianjin Neituo San, adding Qianghuo, Duhuo, Chaihu, and Tianhuafen for decoction to help disperse the excess heat; then take Jingfang Baidu San and apply Jin Si Ointment externally. Furthermore, take Neituo Shixuan San with Bai Shao, Qianghuo, and Jin Yinhua for decoction, and utilize more Datuo Huangfan Pills and Huxin San.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>This condition manifests on both sides of the nape, where the hair is affected. It arises suddenly and requires immediate treatment. If the hair is hard and brittle, it is urgent to address the root cause of the illness. If there is inflammation around the scalp, it indicates that heat has ascended, causing redness, swelling, and hardness extending to the ears and neck, accompanied by cold and hot pain. If not treated promptly, the toxicity will penetrate the blood and flesh, leading to putrefaction and pus. Cases involving bleeding from the head, breathlessness, or phlegm are difficult to treat. The treatment method remains the same, but adjustments with guiding herbs should be made.</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Head Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>This carbuncle relates to the six organs and arises from imbalances in Yin and Yang, leading to heat stagnating upwards and forming a fistula, which damages the brain&#39;s meridians. Therefore, the symptoms of toxicity should not be taken lightly; first, a remedy to dispel toxins and promote flow should be administered, followed by an internal remedy to promote flow and treat the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Hairline Poison</strong></p>
<p>This toxicity affects the Yangming meridian of the hand, resulting from deficiency of Qi and the upward obstruction of wind-heat, leading to sores. A remedy to clear the heart and promote flow should be used first, followed by an internal remedy to promote flow. This condition manifests before the gathering is complete; it starts from behind the joints, resembling grains of rice, gradually turning red and swollen, with a pervasive sensation of heat throughout the body.</p>
<p><strong>Sideburn Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This abscess affects the spleen, stomach, heart, and lungs, caused by the accumulation of heat. Remedies to dispel toxins and promote flow, along with those to clear the liver and promote flow, should be administered. If treatment is delayed, survival becomes difficult.

<p><strong>Pulse for Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headache with a floating yang pulse indicates wind-cold; if the pulse is tight, it suggests wind-heat with a rapid count, and dampness is thin yet firm. A deficiency in qi will lead to headache, and even with a string-like pulse, it will be unclear; if phlegm obstructs, the pulse will be slippery, while kidney stagnation feels firm. Wind, cold, heat, and dampness may cause qi to stagnate, resulting in saliva; if there is deficiency below and fullness above, the patient may experience dizziness. A floating, tight pulse with cold suggests damp heat, and with a stringy, slippery pulse, there is no deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Methods</strong> (Song, Xu Shuwei)</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>A reverse sensation in the brain causes headaches, as does pain in the teeth, indicative of inverted headache due to disturbance. Pathogenic qi rises against the yang channels, causing pain, and if severe, leads to reversal symptoms. For headache accompanied by tooth pain, White Aconite Powder is recommended. If the headache is of kidney origin and manifests at the vertex with intolerable pain, Jade True Pill should be used.</p>

<p><strong>Headaches Associated with External Cold Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Headaches are generally yang manifestations. With a taiyang pattern, headaches are accompanied by fever, chills, and (if there is no sweating) Ma Huang Decoction; if sweating occurs, use Gui Zhi Decoction. If sweating has occurred and the headache feels like it&#39;s splitting, use Scallion White Decoction; if it persists, apply Kudzu and Scallion White Decoction. For a yangming pattern headache, if cold is not feared but heat is, this suggests stomach fullness, and Chéng Qì Decoction should be used. For a shaoyang headache, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate. In the case of taiyin and shaoyin with absence of headache, only the jueyin pattern is noted, treated with Wu Zhu Yu Decoction.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p>When kidney deficiency is affected by great cold, it leads to headaches and also tooth pain. If the pain is severe and persists, it is treated with Tian Nan Xing Pills.</p>
<h3>Head Dizziness</h3>
<p>Dizziness caused by various winds is associated with the liver&#39;s wood element. If the wind qi is excessive, making the head and eyes dizzy, it indicates that the vigorous wood element is overwhelming the diminishing metal element, which would normally control wood. Wood then generates fire, and both wind and fire belong to the yang principle, often resulting in coalescing effects. Yang primarily governs movement, and when two movements collide, it causes rotation. </p>
<p>As the spring equinox approaches the minor fullness period, there are two essential energies indicative of the fire element. From the great cold to the spring equinox, there are seventy-three days representing the initial wind wood energy. Therefore, after the spring equinox, the clash of wind and fire often brings about swirls of wind, commonly referred to as whirlwinds. This phenomenon occurs throughout the seasons, influenced by the five movements and six energies, constantly varying and interacting in infinite ways. It is incorrect to simply state there are no effects outside of particular times, as it merely varies in intensity. </p>
<p>If a person experiences dizziness while riding in a cart, on a horse, or on a boat due to erratic movements and curving left and right, it is said that these movements embody the influence of wind. Dizziness accompanied by vomiting occurs due to excessive wind heat.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhongjing said: In spring, the method of inducing vomiting is suitable. This is because during spring, yang energy is prominent, and both human energy and pathogenic energy rise, hence the need to induce vomiting. The medicines for this purpose can be in the form of pills or powders; when the illness is serious, one should stop without needing to take the full dose, as too much can harm a person. However, for urgent cases requiring vomiting throughout the four seasons, one does not need to wait for spring. For instance, in Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; there is the scallion root and fermented soybeans soup for vomiting in cases of headaches. In the &quot;Comprehensive Formulas,&quot; there is the Turmeric Powder for inducing vomiting in cases of headaches and vertigo. I often use vomiting formulas, all derived from Zhongjing, like the gourd stem powder to induce vomiting for headache due to cold damage, and the scallion and fermented soybeans soup for vomiting in various cases of headache. The method of inducing upward movement is termed as &#39;stirring phlegm&#39;, where the term &#39;stir&#39; implies controlling the movement, whether it contracts or expands. One case involved inducing vomiting for a man; a woman could not stop vomiting for half a month, with saliva accumulating to several buckets, her life hanging by a thread, frantic and at a loss, she sought my help. I prescribed a musk soup, which she swallowed, and it immediately stopped. It is said that when a gourd seedling smells musk, it dies; hence, inducing vomiting functions like gourd seeds. For those who cannot stop vomiting using cocklebur, I utilize scallion white soup to relieve. For those using stone medicine who cannot stop, I use licorice and Guanzhong to relieve. Various herbs and plants can be resolved with musk. My method of stirring phlegm involves probing with chicken feathers; if it does not come out, I throw in a mixture; if that does not induce vomiting, I will keep probing and throwing until it all comes out. If vomiting leads to dizziness, be cautious and do not panic. If there is dizziness when the headache starts, drinking cold water can quickly relieve; if there is no ice, fresh spring water will also do. The strong may manage to vomit once and be at ease; the weak may need to vomit three times to avoid any harm.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Head</h3>
<p>Headaches that persist are the result of illness affecting the three Yang channels. The three Yang channels correspond to different parts of the body. When there is pain in the head and neck, it relates to the foot Taiyang bladder channel. Pain in the area of the eyebrows, commonly referred to as &quot;eyebrow pain,&quot; is related to this. Pain at the temples, commonly termed as &quot;migraine,&quot; is associated with the Shaoyang channel. If the pain continues for a long time, it may lead to loss of vision, due to illness in the three Yang channels being caused by phlegm retained in the chest. First, use tea to induce vomiting to expel the phlegm, then administer Xiangru powder or Baihu decoction, which will alleviate the condition. However, if headaches persist, a concoction of scallion whites and fermented soybeans can be used to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one can take Chuanxiong and peppermint to cool and clear the upper body, as well as concoctions like Soufeng pill or Xiangqiang powder. Zhang Zhongjing states that scallion roots and fermented soybeans can also induce vomiting for headaches due to cold damage. Shuhe mentions that a rapid pulse at the wrist indicates headache. Furthermore, for headaches that do not resolve, one may boil a soup of scallion whites and fermented soybeans and take it repeatedly, after which vomiting may be induced for efficacy. Following this, one can take Chuanxiong and peppermint soup, which are cooling remedies, as well as Soufeng pills or powders. Zhang Zhongjing notes that headaches from cold damage correlate with a rapid pulse at the wrist. Years of suffering from red eyes without resolution indicates the influence of head wind causing headaches, for which Dusheng powder or Bazheng powder may be used. With the heat stagnating in the three Yang channels, headaches may make one averse to sunlight; applying ice to the crown and inducing sweating and vomiting is advisable.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The term &quot;thunderhead laziness&quot; is a mistaken name commonly used. This ailment stems from an accumulation of cold phlegm in the chest, often resulting from excessive washing of the hair. It can be treated by using tea to induce vomiting, thereby expelling two to three liters of cold phlegm; then, one should take three to five doses of Shenxiong pills; finally, taking Yufeng cakes will lead to recovery. &quot;Thunderhead&quot; refers to red, swollen nodules on the head, resembling slices of ginger or sour jujube. These can be pricked with a needle to draw out blood, which will permanently eliminate the root cause.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said that generally, those suffering from &quot;thunderhead laziness,&quot; a commonly misnamed ailment, experience headaches and dizziness due to hair washing, which is indeed a form of head wind. This is caused by the malevolent wind residing in the chest, which, when heated, transforms into phlegm—arising from the effects of wind. Tea can also be used to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one should take Zangyong pills followed by Wujing pills. If it’s a thunderhead condition, typically, there will be prominent red, swollen nodules on the upper body, or facial heat without sweating. The classics say this is because of stagnant fire. To relieve it, one can use a needle to draw blood, leading to recovery. The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states, &quot;When blood is depleted, there is no sweat; when sweat is depleted, there is no blood.&quot; Isn’t it remarkable when both blood and sweat are balanced? For the elderly, treatments can include cooling the diaphragm, detoxifying, and dispelling wind to clear heat. For the young, it is advisable to remove accumulated heat, using rhubarb and bindweed to promote the circulation of qi and blood, thus eliminating stagnation and achieving recovery.</p>
<p>In severe cases of head wind, prolonged suffering may lead to dizziness and unilateral headaches, which relate to the lesser yang fire; if prolonged, it may cause self-binding, with constipation in both small and large intestines. It is advisable to draw blood and use the Da Chengqi Decoction to induce a powerful laxative effect.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Headache Diagnosis and Treatment Principles</strong></p>
<p>Internal headaches come and go, while external headaches are often present; hence, one must focus on internal treatment. This distinguishes between internal and external conditions. The &quot;Golden Chamber True Words&quot; states: in spring, the east wind arises, which causes illnesses in the liver, particularly located in the head and neck, thus the spring warmth leads to headaches. Additionally, the Yang channels converge in the head and face; for instance, the pathway of the Foot Taiyang Bladder begins at the inner canthus of the eye, runs upward to the forehead and vertex, then enters the brain and exits downwards; disorders here cause headaches. The pathway of the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder starts at the outer canthus of the eye, reaches the temples, resulting in pain in the temples and forehead. Wind is received from above; when wind and cold invade from the outside and become lodged in the meridians, it can cause cold-induced headaches, a heavy sensation in the body, and aversion to cold. Treatment should focus on the Fengchi and Fengfu points, balancing yin and yang: if deficient, tonify it; if excessive, drain it. Sweating can lead to recovery, which characterizes cold-induced headaches. Persistent headaches accompanied by tinnitus and functional impairments in the nine orifices arise from gastrointestinal issues, indicating a headache due to qi deficiency.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those suffering from headaches and irritability, the illness is located in the diaphragm, related to excessive yang of the hand and lesser yin, indicating a damp-heat headache. If the qi does not descend but rises, and the headache feels severe at the top of the head, this indicates an upper full and lower empty condition, connected to excessive cold and damp of the foot&#39;s lesser yin and greater yang, potentially leading to kidney-related cold-damp headaches. For headaches that occur on one side, first address the lesser yang and yangming of the hand, then the lesser yang and yangming of the foot; this is categorized as a migraine. True headaches can be severe, resulting in intense pain in the brain, with cold hands and feet, leading to a fatal condition if untreated. Conversely, headaches due to reversed qi arise from extreme cold penetrating to the marrow, as the marrow is governed by the brain, causing the headache and tooth pain. All headaches are generally treated with wind-related medicines; fundamentally, the principle remains. At the highest point, only wind can reach, so those with a lighter flavor, representing the yang within the yin, rise from the earth to the heavens. However, distinctions between the three yin and three yang do exist. For taiyang headaches, there is aversion to wind, with a floating and tight pulse; primary herbs include Chuanxiong, Qianghuo, Duhuo, and Mahuang. For shaoyang headaches, the pulse is wiry and thin, alternating between cold and heat, with Chaihu as the main herb. For yangming headaches, presenting with spontaneous sweating, fever, and aversion to cold, the pulse is floating, slow, and full; primary herbs include Shengma, Gegen, Shigao, and Baizhi.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of headache from the Taiyin, there must be phlegm, with a heavy body or abdominal pain, indicating phlegm accumulation. The pulse is deep and slow, with Cangzhu, Banxia, and Nanshen as primary treatments. For headache in the Shaoyin meridian, when the three Yin and three Yang meridians are not circulating and cold energy is rising, it is a case of cold blockage. The pulse is deep and thin, with Mahuang, Fuzhi, and Xixin as primary treatments. For headaches in the Jueyin, there may be vomiting of phlegm and cold, and the pulse is superficial and slow, with Wuzhuyu Decoction as the main remedy. For headaches due to blood deficiency, Danggui and Chuanxiong are the main treatments. For headaches due to qi deficiency, Renshen and Huangqi are the main remedies. For headaches due to both qi and blood deficiency, the Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction is effective, with slight additions of Chuanxiong, Manjiziz, and Xixin, showing remarkable results. Baizhu Banxia Tianma Decoction is used for treating phlegm blockage headaches. Qingkong Gao is a remedy for headaches caused by wind, dampness, and heat. Qianghuo Fuzhi Decoction is used for treating Jueyin headaches. If dampness is present in the head, one should expel it with bitterness; it should not be treated by fixed formulas. My esteemed teacher once suffered from headaches, with his cheeks turning bluish-yellow during attacks, dizziness, unwillingness to open his eyes, lethargy, and a heavy body, with a tendency to vomit. Jiego said: This is a combined illness of the Jueyin and Taiyin, called wind-phlegm. It was treated with the prescribed Yuhu Pill, and moxibustion was applied at the Xiaxi point, resulting in complete recovery.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<p>For headaches caused by the three yang channels, use Qianghuo, Fangfeng, Jingjiao, Shengma, Gegeng, Baizhi, Chaihu, Chuanxiong, Shaoyao, Xixin, and scallions with their roots, combined in two rotations. For headaches of a yin nature, simply using warming herbs is sufficient, akin to ginger in warming remedies.</p>
<p>When wind and cold injure the upper body, the pathogen enters from the outside and settles in the meridians, causing chills and headaches; or the wind-cold pathogen may remain in the yang channels, leading to unilateral headaches, for which the formulas Sanwuqi, Qiongxin Decoction, Qiongzhizhong Herbal Formula, and Shengbingzi should be used.</p>
<p>For headaches accompanied by irritability, the illness resides in the diaphragm, indicating damp-heat headache. It is advisable to use Qingkong ointment and Xiaoqingkong ointment, along with methods to induce vomiting.</p>
<p>Headaches due to qi reversal should arise from exposure to severe cold, penetrating deep to the bone marrow. Since the marrow is central to the brain, if the brain is reversed, it leads to both headache and toothache; this is termed a headache due to qi reversal. Use the Qianghuo Fuzhi Decoction.</p>
<p>Reversal refers to the upward movement of pathogenic qi causing pain in the yang channels, and in severe cases, can lead to syncope, which also causes headache and toothache. It is advisable to use the Baifuzhi Powder.</p>

<p>A blood deficiency headache arises when the pain attacks from the tail of the fish upward. The appropriate treatment is Danggui Bubai Decoction or modified Siwu Decoction. The term &quot;fish tail&quot; refers to just behind the eyebrows, near the hairline.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by both qi and blood deficiency, one should use the modified Tiaozhong Yiqi Decoction or Anshen Decoction.</p>

<p>Regarding severe headaches, they may exist above the body, but heat pathogens lurk within, influenced by unseasonable weather and pestilential qi, leading to this illness. If there is suppuration and pus discharge, the risk of infecting others arises, which is why it is termed an epidemic disease. Generally, excessive yangming heat with insufficient shaoyang results in an intense fire from the heart, often located in shaoyang or yangming, and if severe, it may reverse to disturb taiyang. </p>
<p>The extent of swelling indicates where to target treatment based on the pathways involved. Damp heat causes swelling, while excessive wood provokes pain. When this affliction arises at the head, it often affects the front and back of the ears, with the initial visible symptoms becoming the primary and fundamental concerns. Early treatment is critical; however, medications should not be overly hastened to avoid exacerbating the condition. If upper heat has not been eliminated and blockages have occurred, it could be life-threatening. This ailment arises from the inside out, classifying it as a blood disease. Notably, since the head is affected by hidden evils in profound areas, treatment should initially be gentle before progressing to urgency.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The initial treatment should be gentle, as it is understood that the pathogenic qi resides above, manifesting in formless distinctions. Once it takes on formlessness, its transmission becomes indeterminate. If harsh remedies are applied forcefully, the pathogen will not be eliminated but instead aggravate the condition. Although gentle medicines are used, if administered abruptly—whether taken before meals or in a hurry—the essence of gentleness is lost, and the medicine cannot rise to dispel the formless pathogen. Additionally, if the properties, tastes, and forms of the medicinals mimic food, they must remain in harmony with gentleness; this includes cold medicines that are either fried or steeped in alcohol.</p>
<p>The subsequent urgent treatment refers to cases where the prior gentle remedies have already alleviated the pathogen by expelling it, allowing the qi to enter the interior, reaching the yin region, and affecting the internal, tangible quality. If the medicine does not act swiftly, it could damage the yin aspects; thus, urgent treatment is required in this context, specifically directed towards the pathogenic factor. Gentle treatment is appropriate for the fundamental condition, while urgent treatment is for the secondary pathogenic factor.</p>
<p>Yin pathogens reside below while yang pathogens are above, indicating their respective origins. The progression of illness does not adhere strictly to this sequence; misaligning gentleness with urgency not only fails to resolve the complications but may further disrupt the condition.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<p>Migraines are characterized by pain on one side of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Various Treatments for Headaches</strong></p>
<p>Headaches are often related to phlegm; severe pain indicates excess fire. If it can be expelled, it can be purged. Qi stagnation in the channels also leads to headaches. Qingkong Gao treats all types of headaches, except for those due to blood deficiency. Blood deficiency headaches, originating from the tail of the fish upwards, are treated with Xiong Gui Decoction and ancient saliva-removing medicine. </p>
<p>Wind headaches associated with phlegm often involve heat, wind, and blood deficiency. For left-sided wind, use Jing Jie and Bo He; for blood deficiency, use Chuan Xiong and Dang Gui; for right-sided phlegm, use Cang Zhu and Ban Xia, with wine and Qin as the main treatment for heat. Additionally, for damp phlegm, use Chuan Xiong, Nan Xing, and Cang Zhu. </p>
<p>For left-sided migraines attributed to wind, use Jing Jie and Bo He, which are the main medicines for treatment. There is a hierarchy in the medicinal roles, where the main medicine (jun) should be predominant, followed by the minister (chen) and assistant (zuo) herbs, depending on accompanying symptoms. For phlegm, treat with Er Chen Tang and supplement as needed; the same applies to other presentations. </p>
<p>One must assess the condition holistically; adjustments should be made as needed without rigid adherence to a formula. Headaches generally correlate with phlegm; if severe pain is present, there tends to be excess fire, thus clearing phlegm and lowering fire is necessary, using Er Chen Tang, supplemented with Bai Zhi and Chuan Xiong as the main. </p>
<p>Individuals with a heavier build are often associated with damp phlegm, for which Ban Xia and Cang Bai Zhu are recommended.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

If the headache is due to a cold, it is advisable to use Fangfeng, Qianghuo, Gaoben, and Baizhi. If the headache is due to qi deficiency, use Huangqi, Sheng Dihuang washed in wine, and Nxing, along with the Anshen Decoction. If the headache is caused by wind-heat, use Tianma, Manjingzi, Chuanxiong, and Huangqin prepared with wine. For bitter headaches, use Xixin.<br>If a thin and dark person has a headache, it indicates blood deficiency, and the remedy should include Danggui, Chuanxiong, and Jiuqing.

If the headache is triggered and there is tight pain at the nape and both sides, it might indicate coldness and deficiency, and a dosage of 357 San may be appropriate. The Suwen says that headaches stem from wind and cold that enter the brain marrow. The Benshifang states that among women suffering from headaches, half are affected, possibly because women do not cover their heads against wind and cold. There are also occasional cases among men.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Headache Pulses</h3>
<p>For kidney-related headaches, the pulse is string-like when raised, and firm when pressed. A headache with a rapid pulse in the left hand indicates heat; a weak pulse suggests stagnant blood. A strong pulse in the right hand points to phlegm accumulation. A large pulse indicates a long-term illness.</p>
<h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Dizziness results from phlegm combined with qi deficiency and fire; the treatment focuses on resolving phlegm, supplemented with qi-replenishing and fire-reducing herbs. Without phlegm, dizziness does not occur; phlegm is stirred up by fire. There are also cases of damp phlegm and fire phlegm. For damp phlegm, Er Chen Tang is often suitable; for fire phlegm, add wine and Scutellaria. If there is a qi deficiency alongside, it corresponds to fire. Treat phlegm first, then combine qi-replenishing herbs to reduce fire. Formulas like Dong Yuan&#39;s Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Tang can be used. For severe dizziness, take Da Huang stir-fried with wine and grind into a powder, then mix with tea to take; alternatively, use Hei Xi Dan to settle the condition, addressing urgent symptoms. For phlegm stirred by fire, use Er Chen Tang with Huang Qin, Cang Zhu, and Qiang Huo to dispel wind and dampness. Dizziness means a dark rotation of vision, characterized by closed eyes, obscured sight, and a sense of unsteadiness like being on a boat. It can arise from extreme deficiency combined with cold; treatment must not take a single repetitive approach.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is wind, there is sweating; when it is cold, there is pain; when it is hot, there is discomfort; when it is humid, there is heaviness. These four environmental factors can invade and cause dizziness. Additionally, when the seven emotions are repressed, phlegm can arise and provoke fire, leading to upward disturbances caused by these emotions. Excessive lust can prevent the kidneys from absorbing qi and returning to their origin, causing all qi to surge upward, leading to qi deficiency and dizziness. Vomiting, nosebleeds, and excessive bleeding can occur when the liver cannot properly regulate the nourishing qi, resulting in a chaotic flow of blood, which leads to blood deficiency and dizziness. </p>
<p>To discover the cause of illness, one must adapt to circumstances and respond accordingly, with the most important actions being the regulation of the rising and falling of qi. One should not hastily induce sweating or purging; an informed person will be cautious of potential misunderstandings. </p>
<p>For early morning dizziness that resolves quickly and becomes a regular occurrence, one should take Zhengyuan drink with Heixi Dan. For headaches caused by dampness, use a decoction with Chuanxiong, known as the Exclude Damp Decoction.

<p>When experiencing dizziness or vertigo, this is often a sign of a gradual stroke. For the robust and fair-skinned individuals with weak qi and phlegm, use a double dose of the Four Gentlemen Decoction with honey-fried astragalus, adding pinellia and tangerine peel, or with a slight addition of chuanxiong and schizonepeta spikes to clear and benefit the head. For those who are thin and dark, use Er Chen Decoction with a slice of scutellaria and peppermint, combined with bamboo juice, ginger juice, and childhood urine for consumption.</p>
<p>If phlegm is abundant and accompanied by weak qi, add ginseng, white atractylodes, and astragalus to Er Chen Decoction, possibly with a slight addition of prepared aconite, and consume with bamboo juice and ginger juice. In cases of emaciation with blood deficiency and concurrent phlegm-fire dominance, combine Er Chen Decoction with Si Wu Decoction, adding a slice of scutellaria and peppermint, and consume with bamboo juice, ginger juice, and childhood urine.</p>
<p>If dizziness is accompanied by wind, then add drugs like fangfeng, schizonepeta, gastrodia, and gentian thus, for those with heat, add scutellaria, coptis, and gardenia; if cold is present, add dried ginger, cinnamon, and aconite. There should be no unrest. </p>
<p>When phlegm is above and fire is below, the fire will rise and move the phlegm. This condition is largely due to excess phlegm, as one cannot have dizziness without it. Even when caused by wind, there must also be phlegm. Furthermore, since fire can provoke phlegm, use Er Chen Decoction with scutellaria,苍术, and qinghao; if qi deficiency is also present, the treatment should primarily focus on phlegm while also including herbs that tonify qi and reduce phlegm.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Efficacious Methods for Headache</h3>
<h4>Headache</h4>
<p>For phlegm-wind headache, it is advisable to use Qingbai Fuzhi Pills, Dingfeng Cakes, or Xiongxin Daotan Decoction. True headaches penetrate from the top into the Fengfu and sink into the Niwan Palace, and cannot be cured by medicine. If the onset is in the morning, death may occur by evening; if in the evening, death may occur by morning. This is because the head is the root of humanity, and when the root energy has first dissipated, recovery is impossible.</p>
<h4>Pulse Diagnosis</h4>
<p>In cases of headache, the pulse is floating and slippery, easily alleviated, but if it is short and weak, it does not heal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Ancient and Modern Medical Canons</h3>
<h4>Headache</h4>
<p>For dampness-related illnesses, symptoms include body aches and fever, a pale face, wheezing, headache, and nasal congestion, with a large pulse. If one can still eat and has a harmonious abdomen, it indicates cold and dampness in the head, hence nasal congestion, and internal medicines will resolve the blockage. If there is fatigue and exhaustion, the vital energy weakens, causing the spleen energy to sink, resulting in headache and fever. There may also be alternating chills and fever, or a steaming, restless heat felt in the muscles. Initially, one may feel heightened energy and wheezing, with body heat and irritation, and the pulse being broad. This can lead to incessant thirst and numbness of the skin; wind and cold can cause alternating chills and fever, resembling typhoid fever. This is illustrated by Li Ming’s principle in the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; regarding labor exhaustion and insufficient energy, as well as the &quot;Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach.&quot; This is due to heat arising from within to the outside. </p>
<p>The Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction treats internal injuries from labor, with vital energy sinking and producing fever, addressing all symptoms of internal deficiency.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For headaches, combine three parts of flowering vine, and if the pain is severe, add five parts of ligusticum. For vertex and brain pain, add five parts of dry rehmannia and three parts of asarum. These four ingredients are sufficient for treating all headaches.

<p>When the sun is afflicted, the evil resides in the skin, resulting in strong pain in the head and neck, and stiffness in the lower back. Generally, diseases of pestilence more frequently arise in the three yang channels as opposed to the three yin channels. A floating pulse with headache and fever indicates an affliction of the sun, which is treated with ginseng and qinghao powder, along with kudzu, scallions, ginger, and perilla for sweating. If there is spontaneous sweating and body pain, use the nine-ingredient qinghao decoction. The major head plague is due to evil qi from heaven, affecting the channels of the sun, yangming, and shaoyang, causing swelling of the head and eyes to become ill. The disease of the sun manifests in the head, particularly in the back of the brain and neck, and redness and swelling in the back of the neck and head. Treatment should employ the wind-dispelling and detoxifying powder, with qinghao and dry rehmannia moving through the channels. If all three yang channels are afflicted and there is involvement in the head, face, ears, and nose, then use the universal detoxifying drink, or the tongsheng powder or detoxifying powder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Headache: Causes from Within and Without</p>
<p>Headaches that arise from within are caused by disorders of qi, blood, phlegm, and fluids, as well as stagnation of the internal organs, as discussed in Dongyuan&#39;s theories regarding headaches from qi deficiency, blood deficiency, and phlegm obstruction. Those that arise from outside are due to external pathogens such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness, exemplified by Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s discussions on cold damage and Dongyuan&#39;s six meridian classifications. </p>
<p>Wind, cold, heat, and dampness are all external pathogens, while disorders of qi, blood, phlegm, and bodily fluids are internal. Treatments should be tailored according to the condition of qi, blood, phlegm, and internal heat from emotions and differentiate between deficiency and excess, cold and heat, adjusting internal treatments and addressing external causes. For qi and blood deficiencies, it is advisable to use Dongyuan&#39;s methods. However, in cases such as those in the &quot;Three Causes&quot; text, where aconite is used to treat qi deficiency, this approach is based on the notion of yang deficiency, rather than a balanced state of blood and qi. For long-term cases of persistent headaches where there is often a combination of phlegm and phlegmy obstruction along with wind and heat stagnation in the meridians, blood deficiency may also be present, necessitating careful differentiation in treatment.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dizziness and Movement Should Be Carefully Examined by the Four Factors</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness involves wind, leading to sweating; cold results in pulling pain; heat causes oppressive discomfort; humidity brings heaviness and stagnation. These four factors can invade and cause dizziness. Emotional disturbances can generate phlegm and stir up fire, resulting in a surge of qi. The emotional disturbances lead to deficiency and dizziness. Excessive indulgence harms the kidneys, preventing the reception of qi and the return to the origin, causing the qi to rise against its natural course—this is qi deficiency and dizziness. Coughing blood or excessive uterine bleeding indicates that the liver can no longer contain the laboring force, leading to disordered blood—this is blood deficiency and dizziness. It is essential to identify the cause of the illness and adapt accordingly, prioritizing stabilizing the downward movement, and avoiding rashly inducing sweating or purging. </p>
<p>The &quot;Subtle Meaning of the Jade Mechanism&quot; states that dizziness is primarily caused by excess above and deficiency below, but does not clarify the underlying reasons. What is termed deficiency refers to a deficiency of qi and blood; what is referred to as excess includes phlegm, saliva, wind, and fire. For causes of illness, those with qi deficiency cannot elevate the clear qi, or excessive sweating may deplete yang, necessitating the raising of yang and supplementation of qi. In those with blood deficiency, due to excessive loss of blood, yang has no support, thus requiring the nourishment of yin and replenishing of blood; these are signs of insufficiency. If caused by obstructive phlegm, one should resolve phlegm and guide the stagnation; if due to wind-fire disturbance, one should clear the upper and lower the fire; if due to external attack, even if classified by the four factors, all require dispersing the pathogen, indicating conditions of excess.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Treatment of Dizziness with Calming and Sinking Methods, Differentiating Between Symptoms and Root Causes</strong></p>
<p>The world speaks of the qi not returning to its origin, and employs elixirs for calming and sinking, such as using agarwood to lower the qi. Fragrant but drying substances disperse qi; can the qi that does not return thus be restored? When using calming methods, one addresses the symptoms when urgent. However, to suggest that one can make the qi return to its origin is not reasonable. If it is indeed returning to its origin, would one wish for it to arise again? Those who experience dizziness that briefly subsides and then returns have qi that has not returned to its origin and whose root cause has not been treated. To ensure the qi returns to its origin, one must seek to treat the root gently and thoroughly. </p>
<p>The classic states: all diseases arise from the movements and changes caused by wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire. Qibo lists nineteen pathological mechanisms, five of which pertain to fire. Is this not indicative of the pathogenic fire arising from the organs? In the &quot;Internal Canon,&quot; Lesser Yang disease manifests as fever and rheum, Greater Yang disease sees dizziness and sudden falls, and Lesser Yin disease presents with confusion, sudden loss of voice, and fainting, all of which pertain to heat-related dizziness and rheum, showing fireshadowing in the symptoms. Lesser Yin vomiting and qi counterflow; bladder conditions causing headaches; Greater Yang disease with qi rushing upward to the chest and lower abdomen, pulling the testicles and affecting the waist and spine, ascending to the heart; Lesser Yin disease causing qi to rush upward resulting in vomiting; are these not all related to the fiery counterflow upward? </p>
<p>For symptoms of dizziness with darkening vision, as if one is on a swaying boat and feels nauseous, this is phlegm. Those who suffer from frequent thirst and excessive drinking will surely feel dizzy, and if they have coldness in the back and nausea, this is due to a deficiency of the body.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heavy Head</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Jade Machine&quot; states that a person is born with the essence of central harmony manifested in three forms: original essence, original qi, and original spirit. These three are the true essence, true qi, and true meridians inherent within oneself. Essence refers to the true origins of the organs and is not to be compared to the nutrients and blood, thus it is called heavenly essence. Human essence and blood are often insufficient; combined with various losses of the true essence, this results in a depletion of nutritive qi. When this qi is deficient, the protective qi cannot stabilize, leading to the essence slipping away, the kidney qi being exhausted, and the yin failing to rise with the stomach qi to connect with the clear yang qi. Consequently, many ailments present as a heavy head, or weakness in qi, causing reduced appetite, with original qi sinking and the pulse becoming faint, scattering externally to the point of near collapse or showing a diminished pulse. This is indeed caused by insufficient original essence rather than an invasion of external pathogenic factors.</p>
<p>The classic states: due to dampness, the head feels wrapped, and the voice resembles that of someone speaking from within a room. If damp heat persists, it steams upwards, resulting in a heavy head, yellowing of the eyes, and nasal congestion. Thus, Dongyuan notes: when dampness overwhelms, it aids wind to balance it, which leads to an assault of dampness from above.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

<p>To treat the Big Head Plague, one should not attack swiftly, as the evil qi will not subside, and it may counterattack from within and harm the person. Furthermore, when the head experiences emptiness, if this emptiness takes hold, it can extend to all areas. Therefore, the treatment method should first be gentle and then become urgent, allowing the evil to lie low. The treatment involves clearing heat and disinfecting; for those who are deficient, it should also help to strengthen vital energy. For those with a weak stomach who eat little, it should additionally assist the stomach&#39;s energy; for those with inner fullness and excessive heat, who experience constipation, it is appropriate to use wine-soaked rhubarb to purge, thus enabling heat to release its toxicity. This is the method of first being gentle and then urgent. If swelling begins at the nose, then progresses to the eyes, followed by swelling at the ears, and finally reaches the head where it knots at the back of the brain, this will halt. If it does not disperse, it must produce pus before healing can occur.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

<p>When there is swelling and pain without pus, it&#39;s advisable to eliminate dampness and disinfect with formulas like Huang Lian Xiao Du Yin. In cases of severe pain, whether painful or numb, and especially if the toxin is profound, apply garlic moxibustion, along with detoxifying medicine. If there is swelling, pain, and constipation, it indicates internal blockage, and purging is necessary. </p>
<p>If the pain is not severe or there is no pus formation, it indicates a weakness, and the focus should be on supporting the digestive system. If there is no pus or rupture, it is advisable to support the digestive system. When pus has formed and there is pain, needling should be done along with supporting the digestive system. </p>

<p><strong>Red and Swollen Head and Face</strong></p>
<p>The classics state: if swelling is above half the body, it is due to celestial energy; if below half the body, it is earth energy. The pathogen invades between the heart and lungs, ascending to attack the head and face, which is a result of improper seasonal attacks, different from conditions of excess heat from rich food. Laxatives containing salt and sulfur must not be used if there is constipation. If the cause is not clearly identified, and the difference between deficiency and excess is not discerned, then using aggressive treatments indiscriminately will lead to mistakes. </p>
<p>It is commonly seen that during times of famine, those who are hungry often suffer from this, indicating damage to stomach Qi, allowing pathogens to invade—this must not be overlooked. Common treatments for exterior pathogens include Ge Gen Niu Bang Zi Tang, Ren Shen Bai Du San, or Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin; if the pathogen is internal, formulas like Wu Li Da Huang Tang or Zhi Zi Ren Tang are used; if neither exterior nor interior issues resolve, Fang Feng Tong Sheng San should be considered; if both exterior and interior are resolved but swelling persists, use Xi Jiao Sheng Ma Tang.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

Additionally, using nasal inhalation (or oral inhalation) to disperse air and inducing sneezing should be done until ten sneezes are achieved. If the medicine does not induce sneezing, treatment is not possible. If pus is expelled in the sneezing, the treatment will surely be effective.

<p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All winds that cause dizziness are associated with the liver wood. It further states: When the wood of the year is excessive and the wind qi flows, the spleen earth becomes afflicted, causing the people to suffer from food stagnation and diarrhea, and in severe cases, sudden irritability and dizziness. Although this is caused by the transformation of qi, it is often due to the deficiency and decline of qi. Those with qi deficiency and a plump physique tend to have damp phlegm obstructing the upper regions, with yin fire rising from below. Thus, phlegm accompanied by deficient fire rushes up to the head, overwhelming genuine qi, leading to sudden darkness before the eyes and the sensation of spinning, akin to being in a moving boat or vehicle, and in extreme cases, there can be fainting with no awareness. What Danxi referred to as &quot;dizziness cannot occur without phlegm&quot; precisely refers to this. </p>
<p>Conversely, in lean and dark individuals, whose bodies are weak, true water is inadequate, or if they overexert themselves, the fiery yang may flare up, they can also experience dizziness from time to time, regardless of damp phlegm. Generally, for those who are plump and experience dizziness, the treatment should primarily focus on clearing phlegm and reducing fire, while also incorporating medicinals to replenish qi. For those who are lean and experience dizziness, the treatment should emphasize nourishing yin and reducing fire, along with herbs that suppress the liver. </p>
<p>Moreover, when examined in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it states: When the wind prevails, the ground shakes. In years where wood is excessively strong, there can also be external wind pathogens causing dizziness due to qi transformation. The treatment method should aim to expel wind and harmonize qi, pacifying the liver and reducing fire, which is a good strategy. Additionally, dizziness may occur due to external trauma; in such cases, there may be obstruction in the heart vessels due to stagnant blood. Therefore, blood circulation should be promoted to disperse the accumulated blockages. By applying appropriate treatments for various types, there is nothing that cannot be cured.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming - Dai Sigong】</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>Headaches can arise from various causes, including Qi, phlegm, deficiency, external pathogenic factors, or as a result of food and drink indulgence or labor-related exhaustion. Regardless of the symptoms, during the suspicious period, one may use prescriptions such as Sheng Bingzi or Wu Qiong Tang. For headaches caused by foul and toxic factors, one may take a fried Xiang Fu remedy to heal. In &quot;Jing Gong’s&quot; explanation of pain, he describes it as something that should flow; blockage results in pain. </p>
<p>In cases of unilateral headaches due to wind, if taking Chuan Wu and Xiang Fu does not yield results, using Lian Zi with Cao Wu may lead to recovery. This approach involves using poison to counteract poison, which should not be overlooked. For headaches from heat in the upper body, a remedy such as Bai Du San with Chai Hu and adding Gan Ju Hua is appropriate. </p>
<p>If there is a history of headaches with dizziness, one should not claim the absence of pain to disregard the possibility of wind; careful examination is essential, and one should not hastily resort to treatments aimed at deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Headaches caused by external wind are painful, often extending to the brain, feeling like being pulled. When this occurs, one cannot open their eyes, and dizziness prevents lifting the head. It is advisable to use Xiongxin Decoction, adding five whole scorpions each time, with intervals of taking Taiyang Dan and Ru Sheng Bingzi, or using Da Cha to mix with powders like Ba Sheng San, Zhui Feng San, and Da San Wu Qi San. If there is heat in the upper diaphragm, use Da Cha to mix with powders, along with Yi Zi San. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by phlegm, especially in those who vomit excessive phlegm, Xiongxin Decoction is suitable, or Xiongxin Decoction without tea buds, and Phlegm-Draining Decoction with half a cash of Xiong, and Ba Sheng San is also applicable. If the condition occurs at any time, commonly known as phlegm-drinking headache, it is due to Qi stagnation and phlegm rising to attack, causing headaches. The best approach is to smooth Qi with Er Chen Tang or Phlegm-Draining Decoction, which can include modifications.</p>
<p>Headaches with heat and a painful lump in the neck can be treated with Du Liang Wan. For itchy and painful headaches due to rotten wind, use external medicines along with grinding black vinegar with iron rust for application, or ginger juice can also be rubbed on.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Phlegm and fluid retention, head wind, the seven emotions, loss of blood, intoxication, and other diseases can all cause dizziness. Each has been explained in its respective context; now I will specifically discuss dizziness not accompanied by other ailments, which is due to deficiency. However, there are cases of recurrent dizziness; some patients experience it upon waking, which soon resolves and becomes habitual. For treatment, one can take Zhengyuan Decoction with Heixi Dan.</p>
<p>There are instances where dizziness is caused by deficiency, where during periods of dizziness, the patient tends to seek warmth by wanting to be near fire to warm their hands. This is because the head and face are the convergence of the Yang energies, which are insufficient. </p>
<p>There are also cases of head wind characterized by a constant ringing in the ears, coupled with sounds resembling chirping birds above the head. One must not hastily conclude that ear ringing is purely a deficiency; it is instead caused by wind affecting the head and brain. </p>
<p>In severe instances of dizziness, when tilting the head, the surroundings appear to spin, and one may constantly see black spots or feel as if objects are moving or doubling in vision. For treatment, small doses of Sanwuqisan, or Qiangfu Decoction can be used, or one may add a coin of deer antler to Zhengyuan Decoction, along with Ling Sha Dan, or use Zhengyuan Decoction simmered with fifteen grains of ChuanJiao, followed by Rongesan Wan. If these treatments are ineffective, one might try using only deer antler, taking half a tael at a time with three cups of unsalted wine, simmering it down to one cup, straining, and adding a small amount of musk to take. There was a case where persistent head pain that wouldn’t go away was effectively treated with Rangzhu Dan.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Cheng Wujin says: Dizziness is not truly dizziness but rather to see one’s own dizziness, referred to as dark vision. &quot;Yun&quot; refers to the movement of rotation; in the world, this is known as &quot;head spinning.&quot;</p>
<h3>Headache Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>If the illness involves headache and eye pain, with a pulse that is rapid, short, and thin, it is fatal.</p>
<h3>Brain Abscesses and Sores</h3>
<p>When an abscess occurs in a specific area of the brain, it can result in brain abscesses, brain sores, or brain inflammation. These can manifest at the point above the large spine bone, entering the hairline and causing brain abscesses. The skin here is thin and easily punctured, so it should be punctured to release pus without harm. Brain sores, however, have thick skin, making it difficult to puncture. Internal toxins need to be expelled urgently before a puncture can be made.</p>
<p>When red sores appear on the left or right temples, regardless of size, they resemble peaches or plums. It is advisable to apply medication and puncture them to see pus without harm. A toxic sore or malignant sore located at the right temple corner, near the temple, can lead to swelling that drains energy and becomes difficult to manage. If it is punctured after experiencing external wind or water conditions, it may harm the individual; therefore, medication is also required to manage pus post-puncture and quickly close the wound. If this persists into the winter months, it may result in a cold sore. Areas near the temple and up to the forehead corner are considered hazardous.</p>
<p>On the left and right temples, if abscesses, sores, or boils develop that do not rupture for five to seven days, toxic energy can flow into the eye socket, causing the eyes to clamp shut. Apply medication to rupture it, and afterward, be cautious about external wind and water. If wind or water enters, it may damage the vision and cause significant eye disorders.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>For chronic headaches, they tend to arise with a slight exposure to wind and cold. In cold months, it is necessary to wrap the head in thick cotton cloth. This condition is one of accumulated heat, with the underlying heat presenting as a superficial cold. People often do not recognize this and typically use pungent and warming medicines to disperse it, experiencing temporary relief and mistakenly identifying it as a cold. They are unaware that due to the underlying heat, the pores are frequently open, allowing wind and cold to invade. The external cold constricts the internal heat, leading to pain. Although pungent and warming medications can open these blockages and dispel the superficial cold pathogens, they also aggravate the underlying heat, worsening the chill. </p>
<p>The primary treatment should be aimed at draining fire and cooling the blood, supplemented by mild pungent and warming agents to address the superficial symptoms. This method is effective for curing the illness and eliminating its root cause. </p>
<p>(Note: Most prior cases focus on phlegm; when the pain is severe, it may signify an attack from wind and toxins. Other causes may include blood deficiency, Qi stagnation in various channels, Qi deficiency, external damage from six excesses, injuries from overexertion, or conditions suitable for purging or vomiting; treatment should be tailored to address both deficiency and excess, along with adjustments for cold and heat. In cases of unilateral headaches that do not improve over time, there may be an internal mixture of phlegm and wind-fire obstructing the channels and stifling the flow of Qi and blood. Severe cases can lead to symptoms like visual disturbances and constipation, which would require blood-letting to relieve the obstruction and address the superficial symptoms. I once treated Liu Yizhai, who experienced pain in both temples when angered. I first used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Poria and Gardenia, followed by Liuwu Decoction to nourish kidney water, which successfully resolved the issue without recurrence.)<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Wind Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The syndrome of head wind often involves phlegm and fluid. It may occur from exposure to coolness during bathing or prolonged lying in the wind, causing the evil wind to enter the brain and neck. Above the neck, areas between the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and eyebrow ridge may experience numbness or lack of sensation. Symptoms may include heaviness in the head, a feeling of movement in the head, or a thick scalp with no awareness. There may be a loss of sensation in the mouth and tongue, making it difficult to taste food, deafness, eye pain, or aching above and below the eyebrow ridge. One may experience extreme scents or extreme foul odors in the nose, or merely yawn and have symptoms of dizziness. For heat symptoms, dispersing wind is effective; for cold symptoms, pursuing wind is helpful. Common formulas include Chuanxiong Chafiaoshan and Qu Feng Tongqi San. </p>
<p>When head wind is accompanied by pressure and pain, wrapping with a soft cloth is often necessary, indicative of heat stagnation. A modified Erchen Decoction with jujube honey, schisandra, chuanxiong, mint, gypsum, and asarum may also be effective. For head wind, Bai Zhi San, Tianxiang San, or modified Xiangxun Decoction, or chrysanthemum tea decoction are recommended.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Dizziness</h3>
<p>Dizziness, also referred to as &quot;faintness,&quot; describes the feeling of darkness (dizziness), the act of rotation (spinning), and the sense of confusion (faintness). These all convey a similar meaning. Generally, if dizziness indicates disarray, excessive sweating, and diarrhea occurring intermittently, such conditions may indicate a severe deficiency that is difficult to treat.</p>
<h3>Heaviness of the Head</h3>
<p>In cases of typhoid, heaviness of the head that cannot be lifted presents two signs: if the yang disease is deep, one cannot lift the head; if the balance of yin and yang is disturbed, one also cannot lift the head; both indicate a critical condition.</p>
<h3>Head Shaking</h3>
<p>In typhoid, if the yang pulse is unbalanced, it causes the head to shake. Those with cardiac cessation may also shake their heads, and if wind is prevalent in convulsive diseases, it will cause head shaking; all of these are ominous signs. Additionally, if there is an internal illness accompanied by head shaking, it also signifies a severe condition.</p>
<h3>Flaking of the Scalp</h3>
<p>The presence of white flakes on the scalp indicates a lung condition. The lungs govern the skin and hair, hence when affected by wind-heat, the scalp becomes dry and itchy, resulting in white flakes. It is advisable to disperse the wind and resolve it.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Dizziness and Pulses</h3>
<p>If the liver pulse is excessive, it is likely to cause dizziness; precautions should be taken.</p>
<h3>Cerebral Abscess</h3>
<p>When there are signs of pain and swelling of the scalp with thirst and a preference for cold, it is recommended to use formulas such as Huanglian Disinfectant Powder, Danggui Qianghuo Decoction, or Clear Heat and Disinfectant Beverage. If there is swelling and pain accompanied by thirst with a liking for hot soup, this may indicate kidney deficiency with excessive yang fire; for this, formulas like Toli Disinfectant Powder, Toli Qi-Boosting Decoction, or Kidney Qi Pill are recommended.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>According to the classics, headaches may result from wind, cold, or deficiency. In discussions of headaches, there are ten types based on environmental factors. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; mentions one type of headache associated with the Taiyang (Greater Yang) stage. All these conditions arise from the invasion of the six external pathogenic influences and the depletion of vital energy, causing the qi to reverse and obstruct the clear pathways, which leads to stagnation and pain. </p>
<p>The head is the manifestation of heavenly phenomena; the clear yang qi from the six fu organs and the essence blood from the five zang organs converge here. Therefore, the six external evils of nature and the five internal changes of human qi can harm each other. This can either obscure the clarity or obstruct the meridians, leading to an accumulation of qi that transforms into heat, with a full pulse resulting in pain. </p>
<p>If the pathogenic qi lingers, it causes a full pulse and chaotic qi and blood, which intensifies the pain; this is true pain. If invaded by dampness and cold, with weakened true qi, although there may not be an accumulation leading to heat, the external factors can affect the pulse; externally, the blood flows cold and constricted, leading to localized pain that ceases with warmth; this is considered deficient pain.</p>
<p>Headaches caused by wind result in sudden, gripping pain. Those caused by heat lead to irritability and a sense of heat. Pain due to dampness results in a heavy head with worsening symptoms when it’s cloudy. Phlegm-induced pain results in a feeling of heaviness and a continual urge to vomit. Cold-induced pain leads to tightness and a shivering response to cold. Pain from qi deficiency is often worsened by exertion, presenting with a wide pulse. Pain from blood deficiency is characterized by heightened anxiety, with a thin pulse.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Headaches have many causes, and ancient remedies often use wind-related treatments; why is that? At the heights, only the wind can reach, and those with a light flavor, arising from the yin within the yang, ascend from the earth to the sky. In cases of wind, cold, and dampness, these are indeed the proper applications, while those that are deficient or heated also rely on references from the classics. One must understand that new and sudden conditions are merely called headaches; deep and prolonged ones are termed &quot;head wind.&quot; Head wind must harm the eyes; as the classics say, the east wind arises in spring, affecting the liver. The eyes are the orifices of the liver. When liver wind moves, it harms the empty orifices. By examining internal and external causes and distinguishing between deficiency and repletion, if one&#39;s chest feels clear, the ailment will resolve instantly. </p>
<p>Wind-damp with heat leads to headaches that obstruct above, harming the eyes and causing brain pain, whether it be unilateral or bilateral. If it persists for years without cure, one should focus on clearing and uplifting the essence, using fine herbs for intense pain. </p>
<p>For phlegm obstruction headaches, where the taiyin pulse is weak, one should use the clearing essence, adding Ban Xia and Tian Ma to Qiang Huo and Fang Feng. </p>
<p>For headaches from yangming pathology, characterized by fever, aversion to heat, and thirst, Bai Hu Decoction should be used, with an increased dose of Bai Zhi. </p>
<p>For headaches associated with kidney obstruction, as referenced in the classics where there is lower deficiency and upper repletion, when the pulse rises, it feels string-like; when pressed it feels hard, thus use Yu Zhen Wan or Lai Fu Dan. </p>
<p>For food-stagnation headaches, characterized by fullness in the chest, sour taste in the throat, bad breath, aversion to food, even with fever yet without body pain, one should use Xiang Sha Zhi Zhu Wan. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by alcohol consumption, Ge Hua Jie Cheng Decoction should be administered.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Anger injures the liver, causing headaches; use incense to reduce qi or Suzi Decoction to lower qi. For headaches with blocked orifices due to qi deficiency, use the Qi-Boosting Decoction combined with peony, Chuanxiong, and Xixin. The area just behind the eyebrows and near the hairline is called the &quot;fish tail.&quot; Headaches from this area belong to blood deficiency; use Four Substances Decoction with mint. If labor or physical activity induces headaches, it suggests stomach heat; take five qian of wine-fried Dahuang and brew with strong tea. For irritability and headaches, use Qingkong Ointment with Mai Men Dong and Danshen. If there&#39;s upper heat causing headaches, with red eyes and lower cold (in the feet), especially if there’s slight constipation, use the Jiji Detoxification Decoction. A unilateral headache is termed &quot;side wind&quot;; the left side signifies blood deficiency, while the right indicates qi heat; the Xiongxi Pill is very effective. True headaches can cause a bluish tint to the hands and feet up to the joints, with morning onset leading to evening death, and evening onset leading to morning death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Headache Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The pulse at the cun position is tight and urgent, whether it is short, string-like, or floating, all indicate headache. A floating and slippery pulse suggests wind phlegm, which is easy to treat. A short and thin pulse indicates deficiency, which is difficult to treat. A floating and string-like pulse indicates wind, while a floating and flooding pulse indicates fire; a thin or slow pulse indicates dampness.<br>— <em>Ancient and Modern Medical Insights</em> (Ming - Gong Xin)</p>
<h3>Headache Diagnosis</h3>
<p>For headaches characterized by yang excess, the pulse is floating, with wind causing tension and cold; a wind-heat pulse is flooding and rapid, while a damp pulse is fine and firm. For qi deficiency headaches, even if the pulse is string-like, it must be thin. In phlegm and qi headaches, the pulse is firm in the region of the kidneys. Additionally, a pulse that is tight and urgent, whether short, floating, or string-like, indicates a primary headache condition.<br>— <em>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</em> (Ming - Xue Ji)</p>
<h3>Headache</h3>
<p>For chronic headaches, they may arise with slight exposure to wind and cold; in the case of cold months, thick cotton wraps should be used. This indicates a condition of accumulated heat with a base of heat but presenting cold symptoms. If warm, pungent medications are used to dispel the exterior, temporary relief might occur, misleading one into thinking it is merely cold. However, due to inherent accumulated heat and persistent openings, wind and cold easily invade. External cold restricts internal heat, leading to pain; though warm, pungent remedies can disperse the cold evil on the surface, they exacerbate the original heat condition, worsening the chill. Hence, the primary approach should be to drain fire and cool the blood, supporting this with warm, dispersing remedies for the exterior. This method can lead to resolution, eliminating the root of the issue. If recovery from a cold occurs, it is also advisable to regulate the righteous qi, nourishing it according to the underlying mechanism of the ailment to prevent recurrence.<br><a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

<p>Li says: For brain abscesses and jaundice in the neck, do not use garlic isolation cauterization, as it may cause the poison to rise and attack. It is advisable to cauterize the Zusanli point five times, the Qihai point three times, and to also take medicines that cool the blood and detoxify, or to use the bamboo horseback method for cauterization. In cases where abscesses appear in the head, neck, or throat, traditional methods have generally been ineffective; however, using this method has led to many recoveries. Preparations such as Five-Spice Lianqiao, Luo-Gu Decoction, Guo Lao Ointment, and Wan Jin Powder can all be selected.</p>
<p>Note: When the condition pertains to the Bladder channel, damp-heat obstructs upward, or Yin fire inflames upward. If due to damp-heat, then the pathogenic qi is excessive while the original qi is insufficient; one should use Huanglian Disinfectant Powder to eliminate damp poison and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If due to Yin fire, then both the original and pathogenic qi are insufficient; in this case, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pill to nourish the kidney water. Should the kidney water dry up, leading to terminal symptoms, urgently apply the modified Eight-Flavored Pill along with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to strengthen the foundation and draw fire back to its source. If the abscess appears dark and does not rupture, or if it ruptures but does not heal, it is termed &#39;Nail Erosion&#39;, which is untreatable. Generally, if swelling and pain are severe, it is advisable to use a life-saving drink and garlic isolation cauterization to dissolve stagnant blood and draw out the repressed poison, although the moxa sticks should be small and few.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable Effects of Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong>  </p>
<p>Danxi discussed that dizziness can be classified into two types, both stemming from phlegm-heat disorders. Although dizziness is associated with phlegm-heat, it is also often caused by kidney deficiency combined with wind evil. Phlegm, being a flowing substance, is further aggravated by the movement of fire. The nature of fire is to rise; when wind is present, it intensifies, and thus the interaction of wind and fire increases the production of phlegm. The texts state: &quot;All dizzy spells caused by wind belong to the liver.&quot; The &quot;Original Definitions of Illness&quot; mentions that both wind and fire belong to Yang, which often causes mixed transformations. Yang governs movement; therefore, when both move and clash, it results in rotation. If a person suffers from dizziness and sudden nausea with a desire to vomit, experiencing blurred vision as though the room is spinning, and upon rising feels unsteady, one must ponder the underlying cause. It is said: tranquility leads to clarity, akin to the transformation of water. Turbulence and disturbance indicate the application of fire. The brain is born of the earthly essence, hence it harbors Yin upon the eyes, forming the connection of the pupils. The kidney water, which governs extreme Yin, values stillness and abhors disturbance. When tranquil, it maintains clarity within; when disturbed, it causes dizziness and disarray. This is what is meant by brain rotation leading to visual dizziness. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot Classic&quot; states: &quot;The essential Qi of the five organs and six bowels all ascends to the eyes as their essence.&quot;<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of muscles, bones, and vital energy, associated with the vessels, is linked to the eyes; it ascends to the brain and exits from the nape. Therefore, when evil resides in the nape, it seizes the body like a tiger. If it penetrates deeply, it follows the connection of the eyes to enter the brain. Once it enters the brain, the brain stirs; as the brain stirs, the connection of the eyes becomes tense; when the eyes become tense, it leads to dizziness. This is because the heart and kidneys do not harmonize, causing a combination of wind and fire. Wind has both internal and external distinctions; wind entering from the outside is combined with transformation, while that arising from within is fire giving rise to wind. Physicians examine the causes of internal injuries and external affections: a floating pulse with sweating indicates wind injury; a tight pulse without sweating, accompanied by muscle spasms and pain, indicates cold reception; a weak, fretful pulse indicates heat; a deep, sluggish pulse causing vomiting and reversal indicates dampness, while a consistently deep pulse signifies something different. As for emotional injuries (the seven emotions), they disrupt the balance of the organs and generate phlegm, which accumulates to form fluids, pushing upward with the qi, causing dizziness, pain in the brow, and inability to open the eyes. This condition can occur in women, as they are often inclined to anger. The classics say: the qi of heaven is called wind, and the qi of humans is called anger. Anger injures the liver&#39;s wood, which in turn generates wind, leading to a spinning sensation in the head and eyes, all stemming from this. Women, primarily reliant on yin blood, may suffer from dizziness due to loss from childbirth or dysfunctional bleeding that weakens their yang qi. Men may experience this condition due to losses from wounds, excessive vomiting, or the effects of alcohol and sexual activity, which exhausts their essence and blood, preventing the qi from returning to its origin and causing all qi to rise, resulting in dizziness. Students of medicine should differentiate between root and branch, separate their severity, and apply medication and treatment accordingly, like responding to the sound of a drum; everything will surely be effective.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

<p>For headache with ear ringing and blockage of the nine orifices, this arises from the intestines and stomach, indicating a deficiency in qi leading to headache. If headaches are accompanied by irritability, the issue lies within the diaphragm and involves the hand Taiyang and Shaoyin meridians, indicative of damp-heat headache. When qi rises but does not descend, resulting in vertex headaches, this points to deficiency below and excess above, related to the foot Shaoyin and Taiyang meridians, and in severe cases affecting the kidneys, leading to cold damp headache.</p>
<p>If there is pain on one side of the head, first treat the hand Shaoyang and Yangming meridians, then the foot Shaoyang and Yangming meridians; this is referred to as migraine. True headache, if severe, can connect to the brain; if the hands and feet become cold to the joints, it can cause sudden death in the morning or evening. Reverse headache indicates a severe cold invading, reaching the marrow; since the marrow is subordinate to the brain, this causes the headache and similar pain in the teeth.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

At the high peaks, only wind can reach; the thinness of the soothing medicine, the yang in the yin, rises from the earth to the sky. However, there are also three yin and three yang diseases. For taiyang head pain, with aversion to wind, the pulse is floating and tight; commonly used are Chuanxiong, Qianghuo, Duhuo, and Mahuang. For shaoyang head pain, the pulse is wiry and weak, with alternating chills and fever; commonly used is Chaihu. For yangming head pain, with spontaneous sweating, fever, aversion to cold, and a pulse that is floating, relaxed, and long; commonly used are Shengma, Gegeng, Shigao, and Baizhi. For taiyin head pain, there must be phlegm; heavy body and abdominal pain indicate phlegm accumulation, with a pulse that is deep and relaxed; commonly used are Cangzhu, Banxia, and Nanzi. For shaoyin head pain, in which the three yin and three yang channels do not circulate in the two feet, with cold qi, reversing to form cold counterflow, the pulse is deep and thin; commonly used are Mahuang, Fuzi, and Xixin. For jueyin head pain, with neck pain and vomiting phlegm, or vomiting foamy saliva and feeling cold, the pulse is floating and relaxed; Wuzhuyu decoction is the main remedy for this.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For headaches caused by blood deficiency, the main herbs are Angelica and Chuanxiong. For headaches due to Qi deficiency, the main herbs are Ginseng and Astragalus. The primary herbs are those that treat the condition effectively. If there are accompanying symptoms, they should be addressed with auxiliary herbs; this is the essential method for establishing a formula. For headaches that involve both Qi and blood deficiency, use the Decoction to Regulate the Center and Tonify Qi, with a slight addition of Chuanxiong, Vitex fruit, and Asarum, which has effects that are extensive. Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction is used for headaches caused by phlegm obstruction. Qingkong Ointment treats headaches caused by wind, dampness, and heat. Qianghuo Fuzhu Decoction addresses headaches with reversal of flow. If dampness is located in the head, it should be expelled with bitterness; one must not rigidly adhere to formulas for treatment. The principles for treating headaches are thoroughly detailed. In discussions of headaches in scholarly texts, why are these principles not explicitly stated? I will summarize. As for headaches caused by pathogenic factors, there is a singular pathogenic influence, differing only in terms of duration and retention. Those that are shallow and recent are termed headaches; their onset is sudden, and they easily dissipate. Those that are deep and chronic are called headaches due to wind, characterized by recurring pain that does not last consistently and may relapse upon exposure after recovery. All these should be verified based on the source of the pathogenic factor for proper treatment.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Trial Efficacy Form,&quot; it is recorded that the elderly Jiegu suffered from headaches in his youth. Whenever the headaches struck, his cheeks would turn bluish-yellow, he would feel dizzy, his eyes would not want to open, he was lazy in speech, and his body felt heavy, as if he were about to vomit. This condition would last several days before passing. He said this was a disease caused by the combination of the Taiyin and Jueyin, named &quot;wind-phlegm.&quot; He used water to prepare the Jinhua pill and applied moxibustion to the two points of Xiexi, each for 27 times, and he recovered in not more than ten days. From this, one can observe that this is indeed a case of head wind. To not mention &quot;wind&quot; here refers to the essence of the meridian; what the world calls &quot;wind&quot; refers to the symptom. Why not clarify that headaches from Shaoyang and Jueyin make one experience unilateral headaches, where the evil arises from the liver and gallbladder with the wind-wood? Later generations thus named it &quot;head wind,&quot; which can be seen as not seeking its origin. Jiagu stated that the primary condition of major head wind signifies excessive邪热 (evil heat) of the Yangming, supported by the solid fire of Shaoyang. It often appears in Shaoyang, or in Yangming, or transmits from Taiyang. The treatment depends on where the swelling is located, following the corresponding meridian for healing.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Humidity and heat cause swelling, while an excess of water leads to pain. This affliction manifests as headaches, specifically in the area before the ears, indicating its source. It is advisable not to use strong drugs hastily for treatment; doing so may exacerbate the condition. This means that if the heat at the top is not resolved, and cold re-emerges in the middle, it will surely jeopardize one&#39;s life. </p>
<p>This ailment, arising from external influences, is essentially a blood-related illness. Particularly, when the head is affected, where the affliction is intangible, treatment should start gently and gradually escalate. The initial gentle approach refers to the evils residing above, affecting the intangible parts. Since they are formless, they can infiltrate anywhere; if harsh medications are used too quickly, it becomes difficult to manage the condition. Even if gentle remedies are employed, taking them hastily—either before meals or in one go—will misalign the gentle approach, rendering the medicine ineffective against the ailment. Therefore, it is necessary to slowly and thoroughly address the intangible evils.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the nature and flavor of the medicine do not deviate from the gentle approach. Moreover, urgent treatment is to be administered when gentle remedies have already purged, allowing the evil influences to enter more deeply into the body, affecting the tangible qualities. If they are not swiftly eliminated, it will damage the yin. This urgent treatment pertains to the guest evils that need to be expelled quickly. </p>
<p>When treating the root illness, gentler remedies are suggested; this refers to the yang evils above and the yin evils below—your primary illness. If treated hastily, it can disrupt the balance and increase confusion.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat guests with urgency means to expel the evil of yin when it is received by yang, and the evil of yang when it is received by yin. This is the guest qi, which should be urgently eliminated. For example, if the lesser yang and yangming are the evils manifesting before and after the ears, when yangming is the evil, it presents as significant swelling. One should first use the formula of Huangqin, Huanglian, and Gancao decoction, prepared by lightly frying, and take it continuously in small amounts; if there is no improvement after finishing, use freshly roasted rat glue on a new tile, wait until fragrant, and combine with Dahuang for decoction, removing the residue, then add Mangxiao, all in equal portions, and sip it from time to time, avoiding food beforehand. With slight benefits, the evil qi will dissipate. For the remedies that follow the yangming channel, herbs like Shengma, Gegeng, Shaoyao, and Gancao are used; for the greater yang channel, Qianghuo and Fangfeng are among them. Additionally, Dongyuan&#39;s treatments are evidenced by his established formulas. </p>
<p>In the four seasons, when many people are afflicted with epidemics, they first feel the onset of cold and heaviness in their bodies, followed by swelling of the head and face, making it hard to open their eyes, leading to wheezing and difficulty in the throat, with a dry tongue and parched mouth. It is commonly said that &quot;big head disease&quot; arises from seasonal changes. Relatives avoid visiting each other due to concerns about transmission. Those who fall ill with this condition for five to six days, are treated with Chengqi Decoction plus Lankeng, which offers slight respite; on the following day, however, the illness returns as usual, and even with another dose, there is only temporary alleviation, ultimately failing to achieve a cure.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient wisdom, it is said: The upper half of the body contains the energy of heaven; the lower half contains the energy of the earth. When disruptive heat resides between the heart and lungs, it causes swelling in the head, eyes, neck, and shoulders. The remedy is to drain this heat from the stomach, which is justified and necessary, though one may not understand the reason for it. </p>
<p>Thus, a prescription is formulated: Huangqin and Huanglian, both bitter and cold, are used to drain heat from the heart as the sovereign; Juhong, bitter and neutral, Yuanshen, bitter and cold, Shenggancao, sweet and cold, and Renshen, sweet and warm, are used for draining fire and tonifying qi as the ministers; Lianqiao, Shuzhizi, and Bohe, all spicy and neutral, Banlangen, bitter and cold, Mabo and Bai Jiangcan, both bitter and neutral, are used for dispersing swelling and disinfecting as assistants; Shengma and Chaihu, which are neutral, are not to be neglected in the Shaoyang and Yangming channels, while Jiegeng, spicy and warm, serves as the vessel to prevent downward movement.</p>
<p>All these ingredients are ground into a fine powder. Half is mixed with boiling white water to drink at intervals; the other half is made into pills with honey to be dissolved in the mouth. When consumed fully, it leads to improvement. If the stool is hard, one should add a qian or two of wine-cooked Dahuang to aid it; if swelling is severe, it may warrant lancing. These methods deeply understand the path of the illness, detailing a complete argument, and are intended as guidance for future generations.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Shaking</strong></p>
<p>Head shaking is attributed to wind and fire, often seen in elderly individuals suffering after illness, mostly due to deficiency. This is caused by the deficiency of vital energy and blood, which allows fire to rise and stir.</p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness is primarily associated with phlegm and fire, but treatment should vary based on the degree of deficiency or excess. In overweight individuals with a soft and slippery pulse, it is due to damp phlegm, and a formula of Atractylodes, Pinellia, and Gastrodia is effective. In lean individuals with a tense and rapid pulse, it indicates Yin deficiency and rising internal fire, thus nourishing Yin to extinguish the fire is recommended. If the pulses are weak and the complexion is pale and haggard, it points to Qi deficiency leading to phlegm and turbid Qi that rises, causing dizziness. This is often seen in those with depression and among women, so soothing the depression is advised. </p>
<p>Middle-aged individuals experiencing a major illness when their vital energy has not yet recovered may feel dizzy or faint upon rising. Their pulse will be weak and slow, or the pulse of the right wrist may be large yet weak. Strengthening the middle and replenishing Qi with double the amounts of Ginseng and Astragalus, adding Gastrodia, and if there is phlegm, including Er Chen Tang, and if there is fire, adding toasted Coptis is beneficial. </p>
<p>In summer, if dizziness occurs due to overexertion in the heat, the pulse will be weak and fine, accompanied by irritability and thirst, indicating heat injury. First, use Six-One Powder and later apply a large dose of Sheng Mai San with Coptis added. </p>
<p>Dizziness arises from a condition of excess above and deficiency below.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The so-called lower deficiency refers to blood and qi; the so-called upper excess refers to phlegm and fire rising. When in urgency, treat phlegm and fire; when in a more relaxed state, nourish the original qi. </p>
<p>A pulse that is string-like, strong, and accompanied by thirst and restlessness indicates an excess of phlegm and fire, possibly due to excessive drinking. It is advisable to reduce fire and transform phlegm using herbs like wine, Scutellaria, Gardenia, the Two Chen herbs, bitter orange, tangerine, mint, Schizonepeta, and another Scutellaria. If there is no nausea, boil two or three qian of rhubarb with wine. </p>
<p>For mid-abdomen damp phlegm that obstructs the clear pathways, leading to dizziness, the pulse must be slow and weak, and it is appropriate to stabilize the stomach and drain dampness. </p>
<p>Wind-phlegm causing dizziness, headache, and nausea with sour vomiting requires a preparation of Banxia, Nanshen, and Bai Fuzhi, ground into powder, and molded into pills the size of a tung seed, coated with raw flour and air-dried. Take ten to twenty pills with ginger soup. </p>
<p>If the head and face prefer warmth and the pulse stabilizes upon pressure, this indicates a yang deficiency, and large doses of ginseng and astragalus are appropriate. </p>
<p>In cases of strong phlegm and weak qi, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added astragalus and a slight amount of fried Fuzhi, decoct together, and mix with bamboo sap and ginger juice.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Tianma, Jingjiesui, and mint are excellent remedies for dispelling wind-heat from the upper body, but they are not fundamental treatments. To treat phlegm with phlegm, to treat fire with fire, or to supplement qi, blood, or nourish yin, it is essential to transform and open the pathways.</p>
<p>For those who have lost blood and experience dizziness, use Xionggui Decoction. For stagnant blood in the chest, drinking leek juice mixed with wine is beneficial.</p>
<p>When wind-heat affects the upper body, presenting with a floating and rapid pulse, along with symptoms of headache and red eyes representing alternating chills and fever, use Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder.</p>
<p>If the pulses in both hands are weak and large, appetite decreases, you feel a slight thirst, and bowel movements occur only every three to four days, then this is a sign of great deficiency due to blood loss. In this case, prepare a strong decoction of ginseng, astragalus, rhubarb, and peony root, and add thirty pills of Lianqiao. Lianqiao should be stir-fried in ginger juice. In winter, add a small amount of dried ginger and further boil the pills in ginger juice until thickened.</p>
<p>In the cold of winter, if you experience dizziness, phlegm and saliva can contribute to this sensation, thus treat with warming methods. </p>
<p>If dizziness arises upon waking, it will stabilize after a short while, indicating that old phlegm in the stomach is the cause; the ancient method involves using Heixidan to remedy it.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

It is preferable to use the medicine of stone to settle the condition, taking effect gradually. Also, it is best to be careful with diet.</p>
<p>In ancient remedies, five qian of deer antler is used, boiled in wine broth, with a small amount of musk added, to treat the deficiency of yang. This is suitable for dizziness arising from a yang deficiency that shows no heat. Dizziness is fundamentally associated with the rising of false fire, stirring phlegm upwards, affecting the eyes, which is why there is tinnitus; when the eyes move, it feels as if the house is also moving. The brain is the sea of marrow; if it is full of vitality, fire cannot ascend, which is why young people do not suffer from this condition. There are also those with inherent weakness who experience this, which cannot always be explained by common theory. Danxi said: dizziness is a gradual onset of wind stroke. After middle age and following major illness, it is essential to nourish and supplement the body, abstaining from alcohol and lust, to ensure there are no worries. </p>
<p>Postpartum blood circulation also tends to be deficient.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Thunder-Head Wind</h3>
<p>Headaches are characterized by a swollen lump, which may be red and inflamed, or accompanied by chills and feverish urgency, all caused by wind-heat combined with fire attacking upward. &quot;Thunder&quot; pertains to the fire of the phase, hence the name. Ancient prescriptions use Shengma and Cangzhu, adding lotus leaves, called Shengma Decoction. However, the Jingfang Baidu Powder is more convenient.</p>
<h3>Headache</h3>
<p>For headaches, the cold pathogen enters the Foot Taiyang channel, attacking the head from above; this is a surface pattern. In headaches, there is a floating and tight pulse, with no sweating and aversion to cold, which allows for the use of sweating methods; if the pulse is floating and relaxed, with sweating and aversion to cold, one should resolve the muscles. Use medications in accordance with the proper season. In Yangming disease, there is no aversion to cold, instead there is aversion to heat, with constipation lasting five or six days, along with full stomach thirst, heat rising to the head and eyes, and a solid pulse; one should regulate the stomach with Chengqi Decoction. For Shaoyang headaches, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction to harmonize them. For heavy-headedness and nasal congestion from dampness, use Guati Powder (to clear the nose); if yellow discharge comes out, it is cured. In cases of phlegm and mucus headaches, accompanied by chest fullness and chills or heat, use Guati Powder to induce vomiting. For Jueyin dry vomiting and foamy saliva headaches, Wu Zhu Yu Decoction should be the main remedy. Though the three Yang types may have headaches, the Taiyang is the primary one. The three Yin types do not have headaches, and only the Jueyin experiences headaches, as the pulse is connected at the apex. If the pain extends to the brain, with both hands and feet appearing blue, it indicates true headache, and death is certain. Generally speaking, headaches belonging to the three Yang types are caused by evil qi attacking upward. The Taiyang primarily governs headaches, but Yangming and Shaoyang may also experience them.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

<p>Regarding dizziness:  </p>
<p>Dizziness indicates a condition between the Lesser Yang and half-exterior and half-interior. The exterior pathogen has transmitted to the interior while the yang in the exterior is deficient, which causes dizziness. Additionally, if dizziness occurs after sweating and purging, it is also due to yang deficiency. In cases of Lesser Yin diarrhea, when it stops, dizziness occurs; if it happens frequently, this indicates extreme deficiency and collapse. In cases of Greater Yang disease, if purged, and sweating is induced again, both the interior and exterior become deficient, leading to dizziness. Those prone to dizziness sweat profusely and may recover. In Greater Yang disease accompanied by dizziness, without aversion to cold, able to eat yet coughs, use Licorice, Dried Ginger, Poria, and Atractylodes Decoction. For Lesser Yang syndrome with blurred vision, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. In Greater Yang disease, if sweating is induced and yet the sweating does not resolve, symptoms such as palpitations in the chest, dizziness, trembling of the body, and the tendons twitching as if wanting to strike the ground, use Zhen Wu Decoction. If after vomiting and sweating the pulse is deep and rapid, presenting with fullness in the chest, Qi moving under the ribs affecting the throat, causing difficulty in breathing, body shaking, and muscle twitching, prolonged cases may lead to weakness; in such cases, use Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes, and Licorice Decoction.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the realm of wind, there are also those who experience dizziness, as wind governs movement. If one sweats excessively, especially if one is weak and only sweats slightly, or if they catch a cold and sweat, using the major Qinglong Decoction indiscriminately can lead to symptoms of extreme reversals and muscle tremors, which relate to the Zhenwu Decoction. For the weakened, the peony should be omitted, and for those with heat, the Aconite should be excluded. If it is necessary to induce sweating, but there is moving qi in the abdomen, one should not sweat, as doing so will cause muscle tremors. If one experiences dizziness and continuous sweating from the head, the most counterproductive response is to first prevent with the Feng, Baizhu, and Muli Decoction, and then follow up with the Xiao Jianzhong Decoction, which can save one from dire circumstances. After vomiting and purging, if there is fullness below the heart and upward-pressing qi, causing dizziness upon standing, with a pulse that is deep, tight, and causing the body to shake, one should use the Fuling, Guizhi, Baizhu, and Gan Cao Decoction, which is effective over time. For a feeling of fullness and oppression below the heart, one should use the Zhi Juzi Decoction, adding Fuling and Gan Cao. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion on Headaches</strong></p>
<p>Medical texts often differentiate between headaches and wind headaches as two categories; however, they are fundamentally the same condition, differing only in their timing and persistence. Those that are shallow and recent are called headaches, characterized by sudden onset, easily dispersed, and quick to resolve. In contrast, those that are deep and longstanding are classified as wind headaches, with pain that appears intermittently and can recur after recovery when triggered. It is essential to examine the source of the illness for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>In popular practice, headaches are treated by either addressing wind or cold, yet it is unclear if there are other underlying causes. To clarify, let us refer to the discussion in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding the causes of headaches. When wind enters from the outside, causing chills and sweating, it results in headaches. If one is newly washed and catches wind, the pain usually manifests on the following day, and one should avoid going out. When extreme cold penetrates deeply to the marrow, affecting the brain, this results in headache and toothache due to brain disturbance. </p>
<p>The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; at first, wind overwhelms, leading to shaking and warmth, accompanied by headache from the pathogenic forces accumulating above. The second force, fire, becomes repressed, and when dust rises, the disease is heat and stagnation above, leading again to headache. Under the governance of Lesser Yang, when heat overcomes, people suffer headaches with fever and chills akin to malaria. When the year&#39;s metal is insufficient, fiery heat prevails, leading to the reversal of yin and yang; headaches spread across the head and top, causing a sensation of heat. In the case of the Greater Yang&#39;s dominance, heat ascends, creating pain at the back of the head, neck, and brain, along with visual disturbances. When the Greater Yang retreats, cardiac pain and fullness occur alongside headaches. The Greater Yin governs dampness; when dampness overcomes, pain may be felt in the waist, spine, and head, often accompanied by dizziness. When the Greater Yin rises in the springs, if dampness prevails, it leads to headache, with the sensation of eyes bulging and neck feeling pulled.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The return of the moon brings a headache, heavy and particularly severe. The return of Yangming causes coughing and distress in the heart, with illness in the diaphragm and headache. From a cold damage, if influenced by great Yang for a day, there is pain in the head and neck, and a stiffness in the lower back and spine. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that wind-dampness causes pain in the thighs and shins, feeling as if walking on ice, and sometimes like entering hot water. It causes distress, headache, dizziness at times, and feelings of sorrow or fear with shortness of breath, leading to death within three years. All these ailments are due to the six qi invading and dampening the true qi of clear Yang, causing pain. When headaches are very severe, there is intense pain in the brain, and the hands and feet become cold to the joints. Severe headaches indicate a deficiency below and fullness above, caused by kidney deficiency which fails to guide the qi of the bladder. Heart distress and headache and tinnitus occur when the nine orifices are obstructed, originating from the intestines and stomach. In cases of heart heat, there is sudden pain and agitation, with headache and facial redness, needing to needle the hand&#39;s Shaoyin and Taiyang. In cases of lung heat, the headache is unbearable, with sweating and chills, needing to needle the hand&#39;s Taiyin and Yangming. In cases of kidney heat, there is a dull pain in the neck, needing to needle the foot&#39;s Shaoyin and Taiyang. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states that for Yangming headache, the face appears swollen, rising with heart distress, needing to needle the foot&#39;s Yangming and Taiyin. For an obstructed headache with painful head pulses, the heart feels sorrowful, needing to draw blood and treat with Jueyin. For an obstructed headache with a heavy and painful head, needling the hand and foot&#39;s Shaoyin is necessary. If the headache is associated with forgetfulness and is not alleviated by pressing, the left and right carotid arteries should be pressed, and then needle the foot&#39;s Taiyin. For a Yangming headache with preceding neck pain, and corresponding pain in the lower back and spine, first needle the Tianzhu and then the foot&#39;s Taiyang. For an obstructed headache with intense pain and hot pulsations in the front and back of the ears, bleed out the blood and then needle the foot&#39;s Shaoyang.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Headaches cannot be treated through superficial points; when struck down, there is evil blood within. If there is pain from injury that has not yet resolved, one should select points on the side rather than from a distance. Headaches should not be punctured; great wind is harmful, and those afflicted daily may recover slowly, thus they must not despair. If there is cold pain in the head, first choose the hand’s Shao Yang and Yang Ming points, followed by the foot’s Shao Yang and Yang Ming points. The bladder, arising from the foot’s Tai Yang, causes pain in the top of the head. The gallbladder, arising from the foot’s Shao Yang, also causes headaches. All these conditions arise from the qi of the organs and meridians being reversed, disturbing the clear pathways of the head, leading to blockages in the meridians which result in pain. The head represents the heavens, where the clear yang qi of the three yangs and the six organs converge. Likewise, the refined essence and blood of the three yin and five organs also gather here. Thus, the six perverse influences from the weather and the five thieves of human qi can harm each other, either obscuring clarity or obstructing the meridians, resulting in an overwhelming condition that induces pain. When hot, the pulse is full; when full, there is pain. If the evil qi lingers, the pulse remains full and the qi and blood become chaotic, thus the pain is severe, and this pain is all substantive. If invaded by cold and damp, although the true qi is deficient, it does not combine to create heat. Yet the evil disrupts the pulse; externally there is blood clots and a cold pulse. When cold, the pulse tightens and contracts rapidly, leading to pain pulling on the small channels; apply warmth to relieve this pain, which is then considered empty. If the pain arises from wind and wood, there may be a pulling sensation from the evil wind, sometimes accompanied by sweating. If the pain is due to summer heat, there may be sweating or not, but it is all due to harmful heat causing pain. If the pain arises from dampness, there is a feeling of heaviness in the head, especially exacerbated by cloudy weather.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who experience pain due to phlegm and fluids also suffer from dizziness and a heavy sensation in the head accompanied by a desire to vomit. Those who have pain caused by cold feel intense cold and discomfort. The pain is associated with the wind, cold, damp, and heat corresponding to the internal organs. Additionally, there is pain from Qi deficiency, which worsens with exertion, and the pulse feels large. In cases of blood deficiency leading to pain, the person feels easily startled, and the pulse is hollow. Based on these symptoms, along with careful examination, no case is overlooked.</p>
<p>For headache related to the three Yang channels: use Qiánghuó, Fángfēng, Jīngjiè, Shēngmá, Gègēn, Báizhǐ, Chái-hú, Chuānxiōng, Sháoyào, Xìxīn, and the white part of scallions.</p>
<p>For headaches of a Yin pattern, only warming tonics should be used, such as Lǐzhōng Decoction or Jiāng Fù.</p>
<p>For headaches due to wind, damp, and heat that obstruct the eyes and brain and cause lingering pains, it&#39;s crucial to clear the upper organs. For bitter headaches, add two qian of Xìxīn to the mixture; if the Taiyin pulse is slow with phlegm, known as phlegm obstruction headache, remove Qiánghuó, Fángfēng, Chuānxiōng, and Gāncǎo, adding one and a half liang of Bāxiàn; if migraines do not improve, reduce Qiánghuó, Fángfēng, and Chuānxiōng by half and double the amount of Chái-hú. </p>
<p>For headaches with fever, aversion to heat, and thirst, this is Yangming headache, and it should be treated with Bái Hǔ Tāng plus Báizhǐ.</p>
<p>For headaches that cause dizziness, blackened vision, and pain, use Ānshén Sǎn or Chuānxiōng Sǎn.</p>
<p>For heat-induced headaches, even in severe cold, there is a desire for a light breeze; warmth or smoke may provoke a recurrence of pain. In such cases, use Qīngshàng Xièhuǒ Tāng followed by a Qi-replenishing decoction.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by wind and heat, use Shígāo Sǎn or Jīngjiè Sǎn.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p></div>

<p>For headaches, chest pain, reduced appetite, difficulty swallowing, coldness, and a rapid left cun pulse, it is suitable to use the Ma Huang and Wu Zhu Yu Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is damp heat in the head causing headaches, one must expel it with bitter herbs. For mild cases, use the Tuo Ding San (Top-Dissolving Powder), and swallow saliva through the nose. </p>
<p>Newly washed and then struck by wind is called &quot;first wind.&quot; If the head and face sweat excessively and are sensitive to wind, it is best to take care of the wind for one day, as more wind will lead to severe illness, and on the day of the wind, recovery will be slight. The Da Chuan Qiong Wan (Great Chuan Qiong Pill) is the treatment for this. </p>
<p>When wind energy travels through the wind palace upwards, it results in &quot;brain wind.&quot; There may be coldness in the back of the neck and extreme cold in the brain; the Shen Sheng San (Divine Holy Powder) is the treatment for this. </p>
<p>In general, when treating headaches, one should use acrid and warming herbs such as Qiong, Zhi, Qiang, and Feng, which elevate and disperse. This is because a deficiency in wood (the liver) fails to elevate and disperse, and when earth is scarce, it leads to blockages and pain. Thus, these herbs assist the liver&#39;s wood energy to disperse the blockage. However, if the wind is too excessive and dispersing too much leads to worsening pain, it is advisable to use sour, astringent herbs to descend it back to normal; similar remedies include Frankincense powder. </p>
<p>For headaches caused by blood deficiency, particularly those that ascend from the tail of the fish (the lumbar region), it is recommended to use Dang Gui and Chuan Qiong.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Classic says: When the Yangming channel experiences guest and grandson pulses, there will be headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal swelling. This is because Yangming is associated with the upper body; thus, the grandson channel corresponds with Taiyin, leading to headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal swelling. For cases of heavy head, pain, and hot tidal sensations, they are related to the stomach. Dan Xi states: When headaches feel like they are splitting, take half a tael of dry-fried rhubarb and brew it with tea. Lou Quanshan asserts: If the headache is due to stomach issues, purgation is necessary for recovery. For example, Sun Zhao used the Li Ge medication to alleviate Zhang Xueshi&#39;s headache caused by food stagnation; Guo Maoxun used the He Long Dan to treat his sister-in-law&#39;s postnatal residual blood headache, and immediate purgation led to relief. </p>
<p>When there is agitation and headaches, the issue lies in the diaphragm. The problem resides in the hand&#39;s major Yang and minor Yin channels, treated with methods like Qing Kong Gao from Dong Yuan. Headaches that are severe at the top and accompanied by lower vacuity and upper fullness stem from the foot&#39;s minor Yin and major Yang. In severe cases, it even pertains to the kidneys; Xu Xueshi referred to this as kidney deviation headache. When the pulse is raised, it causes dizziness; when pressed, it feels stiff. Treat this with Yu Zhen Wan. Dai Fu’an used Zheng Yuan San or Da San Wu Qi San, to be taken with salt. Alternatively, add fifteen fried peppers into Zheng Yuan San, then take it after boiling with Fu Dan, sometimes incorporating He Xi Dan. If various medications are ineffective and pain intensifies, Ru Zhu Dan should be considered. </p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Headaches that are severe at the top, with lower vacuity and upper fullness, are related to the foot&#39;s minor Yin and major Yang and can severely involve the kidneys.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

Dizziness and deafness are manifestations of this condition. Therefore, liver deficiency leads to head dizziness, while kidney deficiency causes vertex pain—these are different. For liver deficiency, Gui Tou Decoction is recommended.</p>
<p>For headaches caused by food stagnation, symptoms include chest fullness, sour taste in the throat, aversion to food, and although there may be fever, the body does not ache; it is advisable to use the Middle-Jiao Decoction with a gram of sand ginger, or a red pill.</p>

<p>This condition refers to a headache accompanied by lumps. Some say it feels like the sound of thunder. It arises from the invasion of wind pathogens; when the wind moves, it produces sound. Zhang Zi He used tea to adjust the powder and induce vomiting, then followed with Shen Xiong pills to purge it, after which he took Wu Jing pills and similar remedies to eliminate wind. </p>
<p>For severe cases, Cooling Barrier Powder and Disperse Wind, Clear Heat remedy are employed. If there are red, swollen lumps on the head, resembling sour jujubes, using a fine needle to draw blood may cure it. There are also cases caused by phlegm and fire; phlegm generates heat, and heat generates wind. When phlegm ascends and blocks the airways, compounded by wind, it naturally produces sound—light like a cicada&#39;s chirp, heavy like the rumble of thunder—hence the name Thunderhead Wind. </p>
<p>The remedy includes half summer (banxia), tooth soap, and ginger juice, boiled in one or two parts; soak in yellow rice wine until fully absorbed, then wrap in damp paper and simmer, repeating this soaking and simmering three times, using two parts. Additionally, include five qian each of white silkworms, forsythia, tangerine peel, platycodon, and gastrodia; seven qian of fried scutellaria with wine; and three qian of mint leaves; one qian each of white angelica, blue mineral stone, and powdered grass.

<p>Heavenly Gate hurts truly, pulling up to the brain, causing death at dusk and awakening at dawn; death at dawn and awakening at dusk. The brain is where the essence of marrow gathers, and it is intolerant of evils; if it suffers from evil, death is inevitable and untreatable. An ancient formula states that with black tin pills, moxibustion at Baihui, and the vigorous addition of ginseng, sandalwood, black, and attached (herbs), one may have a chance of recovery. However, if the heavenly pillar is broken, it is also difficult to exert power.</p>
<p><strong>Large Head Disease</strong></p>
<p>When the head swells large like a bowl, this is indeed a seasonal epidemic of the heavens. In the East, during the supervision of Ji Yuan taxes, there are many epidemics in the prolonged summer. Initially, there is a dislike of cold and a heavy body, followed by swelling of the face and eyes. One cannot open their eyes, breathes with difficulty, the throat feels obstructed, the tongue is dry, and the mouth parched; it is commonly called the large-headed disease invoked by the heavens. Thus, I prescribe a formula using Huanglian and Huangsuo, bitter and cold, to drain heat from the heart and lungs as the monarch; Juhong (tangerine peel) and Yuanshen (scrophularia), also bitter and cold, combined with sweet licorice to drain fire and replenish qi as the minister; Lianqiao (forsythia), Shuzi (rubus), and Bohe (mint), bitter and spicy yet neutral, Banlan Gen (isatis) with a sweet and cold flavor; Mapi Bo (a type of herb), and Baijiang Can (silkworm) are bitter and neutral, dispersing swelling and detoxifying to quell cough as assistants; Shengma (cimicifuga) and Chaihu (bupleurum), bitter and neutral, guide the qi of the Shaoyang and Yangming channels; and Jiegeng (platycodon) with a spicy and warming flavor serves as a vessel to prevent downward movement. </p>
<p>Grind all to a fine powder, mix with decoction, and take regularly; mold into pills with honey and dissolve in the mouth for complete recovery. Thus, the complete formula has helped many, named the Universal Detox Drink. Other variations include Black and White Powder, Sweet Tangerine Decoction, adding Shuzi, Lianqiao, Dahuang (rhubarb), Yuanming Powder, Baijiang Can, and Jing Jie (schizonepeta).<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

Note that the above treatment must be used when there are symptoms of wind-heat attacking the head, causing dizziness and pain. If there are merely white flakes, it is best to use external treatments like Bai Zhi or Ling Ling Xiang.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Head</strong></p>
<p>What causes a heavy head? It is due to the external dampness of the heavens and the internal phlegm from the body rising up. It can also result from the inversion of the yin energy from below, all leading to a heavy head. How do we know this? The head resembles the heavens, and its energy is extremely clear. The energy of the earth, however, is heavy and turbid; the earth represents yin and humidity. When external dampness combines with internal steam, it must obstruct the clear pathways, leading to poor circulation of qi and blood, causing heaviness. The Inner Classic states: &quot;Yang energy is affected by dampness, causing the head to feel wrapped, indicating external dampness covering it.&quot; It also states: &quot;For those with spleen heat, the initial symptom is a heavy head, as the stomach channel brings the heat upward to the head.&quot;<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nod</strong> </p>
<p>Nod, it is both wind and a person. Both act actively, meeting at the peak, thus it is called a nod. The Inner Canon says: &quot;Fluctuating, obscured and beckoning, eyes closed and ears deaf, fullness below and emptiness above, with issues in the lesser yang and the jueyin.&quot; The commentary explains: &quot;Fluctuating&quot; refers to a disease. &quot;Obscured&quot; means unclear vision. &quot;Beckoning&quot; indicates an unsteady sway. &quot;Severe&quot; means significant. When vision is unclear and the head sways severely. Moreover, when the Taiyin recurs, it causes heavy pain in the head and neck, with severe swaying and shaking. The commentary states this arises from internal dampness reversing, lingering in the chest from the sun and causing a swaying illness. The Spiritual Pivot mentions that in the governing channel’s divergence, if it is deficient, the head might feel heavy and sway high. Thus, the pathologies referred to as dizziness and swaying are all related to the liver and wood. The top of the head is where the foot taiyang passes, where the governing channel meets the jueyin, hence the fire reversed from the three channels gathers here, and all swaying arises from wind and wood. Zhang Zhongjing also stated that when the heart is extinguished, it directly corresponds to nodding the head.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

A strong or forceful right cun pulse could be either slippery or string-like, indicative of phlegm-fire accumulation; a thin or relaxed pulse with a heavy body suggests dampness. A left pulse that is insufficient indicates blood deficiency; a right pulse that is insufficient signals qi deficiency; both sides weak represent a deficiency of both qi and blood. A tight and exuberant right cun indicates food accumulation; a large surging right guan indicates stomach heat attacking upwards. A thin string-like pulse at the inch indicates wind and cold phlegm above the diaphragm, possibly leading to vomiting; a sinking thin pulse suggests hidden toxins from a cold-induced illness, where headaches occur without high fever, resulting in severe headache and ocular pain; a rapid and short pulse signifies impending death.</p>
<p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness refers to blackening of vision. Movement, as in rotation, is commonly referred to as a spinning head. According to the Inner Canon, dizziness is related to the liver and wood element, corresponding to deficiencies above. Danxi emphasizes replenishing deficiencies and treating phlegm to lower fire. Zhongjing also prioritizes phlegm and fluids in treating dizziness. Zhao Yide states that Danxi speaks of fire, and the Dao is everywhere. What is the Dao? It embodies yin and yang, water and fire. The clear and tranquil aspects represent the transformation of water; the disturbing and chaotic aspects typify the function of fire. The brain is born of earthly qi, thus it is housed in yin. The pupils of the eyes are also governed by the kidney&#39;s water element. Therefore, both are inclined toward tranquility and dislike disturbance. Tranquility leads to clarity, while disturbance results in disorder; thus, when the brain turns and vision is dizzy, it is due to fire.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a></p></div>

Therefore, when evil enters through the neck, if it encounters a deficiency in the body, it goes deep and follows the connection to the eyes into the brain. Once it enters the brain, the brain moves; when the brain moves, it causes the eyes to become urgent. When the connection of the eyes is frantic, it leads to dizziness and rotation. The so-called evils refer to various external and internal pathogens of wind, cold, dampness, and heat. However, these evils are all attributed to the effects of fire. What is dizziness? The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that all winds that cause dizziness belong to the wood element of the liver, specifically referring to wind evils. The &quot;Yuan Bing Shi&quot; explains this: Wind and fire are both yang, and often transform together; yang governs movement. When two movements clash, the head and eyes become dizzy and spin. Fire is inherently dynamic; when flames are combined with wind, they naturally rotate, resulting in dizziness and swaying. Dizziness refers to confusion and chaotic rotation. Is this not caused by wind evils initiated by fire? However, wind can originate both internally and externally; the external ones are combined with fire transformations, while internal outbreaks are particularly due to wind generated from fire.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the examination of various texts, it is said that the Qi of the Jueyin governs the heavens. When there is victory in Jueyin, symptoms like tinnitus and dizziness appear, which correspond to the dominance of Jueyin. This Qi governing the heavens enters from above. Additionally, when the annual wood Qi is excessive, it leads to symptoms of dizziness, irritability, and an overflowing of the liver and lungs, often causing forgetfulness and sudden dizzy spells. Furthermore, when the lesser yang and Jueyin are excessive, it affects vision, causing flickering and obscurity. The Chao family also notes that pain under the ribs and headaches indicate a full liver. This may arise from the liver responding to the weather or from the internal movements of Qi, termed as &quot;wind&quot; rather than flames of fire, which cannot ascend to the head. As for the excessive wood Qi, it can severely result in tinnitus, dizziness, inability to recognize others, and a tendency to faint or collapse, particularly when the fire within the liver wood is intense. This internal response of weather Qi in the organs, associated with the liver&#39;s state of excess or deficiency, is likewise referred to as internal wind.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that when the Taiyang (greater Yang) is prevailing, heat rises, causing pain in the head, neck, and brain, as well as eyes appearing to protrude. The commentary states that this is due to cold qi oppressing and overwhelming the Yang, which cannot resist. The qi of Taiyang is located at the summit, and its entry into the brain is why this disease manifests in this manner. It is said that Taiyang governs the heavens and is associated with sadness and vertigo.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says that when evil resides in the heart, the illness is similar. In both cases, the evil presses down on the heart, causing the spirit to feel unsettled, leading to sorrow, while the fire of the heart fails to circulate, resulting in an upward disturbance. When it comes to Taiyin (greater Yin) recovery, the Yin qi rises, inducing internal fluid accumulation that leads to pain in the head, neck, and chest, with especially severe symptoms of dizziness. The commentary points out that internal dampness is rebellious, and cold qi fails to circulate, causing Taiyang to remain above, resulting in this illness.</p>
<p>It is noted that Taiyin governs the springs, and when this is the case, pain in the head and neck occurs with dizziness, which the commentary declares is also a disease of the Foot Taiyang. It is said that Taiyin governs the heavens; thus, there will be head and neck pain with noted dizziness. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; explains that when the evil resides in the kidneys or neck, dizziness may occur at times, all stemming from dampness harming the kidneys and pressuring the qi of Taiyang, which becomes retained above, leading to such results. Furthermore, the &quot;Jin Kui Yao Lue&quot; states that when there is a fluid accumulation below the heart, those who suffer from dizziness are also experiencing an upward surge due to the heart fire not moving properly.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that a floating pulse at the yuan indicates damage to the kidneys, while a tight pulse at the fu-yang indicates damage to the spleen. When wind and cold clash, consuming grains leads to dizziness; a slow yangming pulse indicates difficulty in achieving fullness after eating. When one feels full, it causes agitation and dizziness. Both of these arise from a deficiency in the spleen and stomach and insufficient yang energy, showing as slow and tight pulses externally, while internally stagnation from dampness causes a slight deficiency of yang to clash with the heat of the stagnation and rise to the head and eyes. By comparing these conditions, dizziness is not caused by a single pathogen. As for the Taiyi, the true primordial qi is nourished by the yang of the stomach, which circulates throughout the body, distributing the six meridians of the three yin and three yang, with the six qi responding to the heavenly yin and yang, running on the surface, which is called the six transformations; the five elements are distributed to the five organs, corresponding to the qi, and the yin and yang of the earth running internally is called the five yang.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the external and internal aspects are distinctly divided, when the channels are harmonized and the internal organs resonate with one another, the external and internal must seem like two yet are one; one and two coexist. This is akin to the natural world having both virtue and transformation, utility and variability, embodied in the form of the body. The text states: success and failure hinge on movement. When movement is tranquil and clear, it nurtures and organizes; when movement is restless and chaotic, it gives rise to harsh diseases. From this perspective, dizziness caused by the energy of a person is surely not limited to what the &quot;Jin Gui&quot; states about dampness from drinks. If the five Yangs and six transformations act wantonly, can the resulting ailments be easily counted? Moreover, any excess or depletion may arise according to the movements of the energies within the channels and organs, which is referred to as the fire of the Yang Qi. The fire of the Yang Qi has five varieties, called the five evils. The transformations of these five evils lead to the onset of diseases. It may happen that kidney water is insufficient, or essence and blood are depleted, unable to control the solitary brightness of the five Yang fires, or that the central energy is weak, unable to resist the rebellious energy below, allowing the fire of dragon and thunder to stir at the summit. Various fires reaching the head may cause pain or, if light, lead to dizziness and vertigo.

<p>Someone may ask: How should one treat various evils?

If it manifests as a reversal pressing upward, then treat the disturbance below that causes the reversal. If it arises from a deficiency in Yin, replenish the Yin and restrain the Yang to stabilize it. If it is due to Yang deficiency causing the Qi to float upward, then replenish the Yang and gather the drifting Qi. If the movement is due to the five emotions, stabilize the related organ&#39;s Qi to bring balance. If it arises from stagnation, treat the underlying cause of the stagnation to release and resolve it. If it is caused by deficiency in essence and blood, continuously replenish it, then address its associated factors to mitigate it.

<p>Headaches can be caused by wind, fire, dampness, or phlegm. Additionally, the poisonous effects of wild bayberry can attack from above, resulting in similar symptoms. Moreover, if a woman bathes or combs her hair too early after giving birth while exposed to the wind, this can also lead to headaches, which is referred to as &quot;head wind.&quot; The recommended treatments are Tianma cakes and San Sheng powder.

<p><strong>Discussion on Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>A brain abscess is commonly referred to as &quot;dui kou.&quot; However, there are different causes: it can arise from damp heat accumulation, which is a lighter external cause; or from internal congestion of the five organs, which is a more severe internal cause. Why is this so? The disease of damp heat is influenced by the weather; imbalances between cold and heat, seasonal shifts, and disruptions in yin and yang can make individuals with weak constitutions more susceptible. Although the back of the neck is associated with the governing vessel, it also governs the path of the taiyang cold water energy. Any incursions will cause qi and blood to congeal. Once congealed, swelling will arise, as seen in external infections. The initial symptoms may include headaches, with many appearing at key points. Within three to four days, there are thickening pains, initial fever and chills, dry mouth, red complexion, firm sores that gradually increase in size, intermittent pain, easy development of pus or decay, normal appetite, and typical sitting and standing. Although the external signs may seem fearsome, there are no serious internal symptoms involved, which indicates a yang condition originating externally; thus, many cases may resolve without treatment.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All formations of the five organs are heavy, and their sources are fivefold: First, the heart governs blood, thus when the heart is disturbed, it causes agitation and unrest, leading to an increase in internal heat that results in swelling when interacting with cold water in the neck. Second, the liver governs the tendons, hence anger injures the liver; the neck is where the three Yang meridians converge. When the liver is injured, the blood vessels are not nourished, and the tendons lose their sustenance, leading to a swelling that causes tightness and pain in the neck, and the patient cannot turn or lean. Before the condition ruptures, the meat appears purplish and dark, hard and swollen; when it does rupture, there is blood and watery discharge, pain without pus. Such signs indicate an injury to the liver&#39;s qi. Third, the spleen governs the muscles, thus overthinking injures the spleen. If spleen qi diminishes, or if rich foods harm the stomach, leading to dryness of the gastric juices, this can cause obstruction in the middle jiao, preventing the flow of qi, which then results in swelling beneath the flesh. The external skin may rot, but the interior remains hard and does not rupture; the mouth is dry, the tongue parched, and there is an aversion to food, leading to a breakdown of transport, with pus discolored and corrupt. Such manifestations indicate injury to the spleen&#39;s qi. Fourth, the lungs govern the skin and hair; hence, grief injures the lungs. When the lungs are injured, the pores are blocked, channels do not communicate, and qi cannot flow smoothly, leading to accumulated swelling.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

The breath is coarse and short, the face is pale and the nose is dry, producing phlegm and frequent coughing. These symptoms indicate damage to lung qi, which is the fourth category. The kidneys govern the bones and marrow; hence, indulging desires harms the kidneys. When the kidneys are damaged, the true yin energy is compromised. Once the true yin fails, primal fire arises. This fire can rise and fall on its own, either moving or still, scorching the organs, consuming fluids, altering form and sound, with lesions appearing purple-black, the pulse quick and irregular, restlessness and dry mouth, drinking in response to thirst.

<p>In treating these conditions, one must differentiate between deficiency and excess internally, discern yin and yang externally, align with the natural seasons, and analyze the pathology. If the lesions have not yet formed within seven days, one should open the orifices and induce sweating; if the disease has set in after seven days, treatment should include supplementation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Additionally, apply cooling medicine; if the qi and blood become frozen, then the muscles can die in abundance, making it difficult for them to decay and corrode. I often treat this condition, especially when boils begin to form but have not yet matured, using a &quot;Pi needle&quot; as described in the &quot;Lingshu&quot; on the nine needles, where the Pi needle is essential for major boils and pus. When inserted at the apex, one can identify the painful area and extract the harmful blood, opening the sore channels. Follow by inserting a toad venom stick straight to the bottom of the sore, apply an external ointment, and internally take the &quot;Wanling Dan&quot; or &quot;Toad Venom Pill&quot; to induce a great sweat and disperse the toxins accumulated inside. The next day, the affected area may be swollen or not, painful or not; continue the insertion and application until the swelling is prominent, the base is raised, and there are cracks with pus around it, at which point treatment can cease. If the insertion is gentle, after nine days, the hardened, unresolvable roots of the disease may be expelled. For severe toxins that cannot drop off suddenly, they may gradually corrode into pus, thus transforming the condition from severe to mild through this effective method. Externally, use the &quot;Yuhong Ointment&quot; to promote growth, and internally take supplements to consolidate the area; the condition will soon heal by itself. For light Yang syndromes, allow for natural decay. There is no need for needle puncture if there is no swelling or pain; even moxibustion does not cause pain.

<p>The scalp carbuncle arises from the hand&#39;s lesser yang triple burner, where the fire moves erratically, compounded by the kidney&#39;s water failing to restrain the fire, or from an external influence of wind-heat. This channel possesses a lot of qi but little blood, and the muscles are thin; hence, when afflicted, it is most difficult to ulcerate. All of this stems from an urgent and violent emotional state, sexual desire, blood deficiency, and the liver&#39;s fire stirring the qi, leading to congestion and formation. </p>
<p>In the initial stages of the carbuncle, there is an interplay of cold and heat, with dizziness, intense pain in the temples, and in severe cases, swelling that connects the ears and eyes to the temples. Treatment should not involve reckless acupuncture; one must differentiate between yin and yang, exterior and interior, as well as between pathogenic and normal conditions to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, when the sore is first observed, it tends to be more cold than hot, with dry mouth and thirst, a preference for drinking hot soup, weak and rapid pulse without strength, alongside the condition of hardness with little pain, no ulceration, and no pus, with the root of the sore spreading.

This is because it retains the original membranous covering, so even if the poison is expelled, the membrane remains, leading to recurrence. If the swelling is severe and has developed pus, it should be pierced with a needle, and a three-pronged instrument should be inserted into the opening to dissolve the internal membrane for self-healing. There are also cases where there is no pus and the wound does not close; this is likely due to wind attacking the mouth, for which it is advisable to apply a powder of degraded copper and to avoid certain flavors for self-healing.</p>

<p><strong>Methods for Treating Excess Damp Heat in the Head</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; the treatment of excess damp in the upper jiao relates to the notion in the &quot;Neijing&quot; that excessive damp leads to heat, and distinguishes between light and heavy conditions. In light cases, there is merely fever, reddened face, shortness of breath, head pain, nasal congestion, and restlessness, indicating the pathogen is in the upper jiao with no other internal illness. One should use internal medicines via the nose to remove the damp heat causing yellow fluid. As the nasal passages serve as the gateway to the brain, using methods that act through the nose is the most effective approach. In heavy cases, there is fever with cold feet, occasional hot head and reddened face, all clear signs of excess damp turning into heat. The excess damp upwards leads to heat, causing heat in the head, redness of the face, and red eyes. The abundance of damp heat obstructs yang qi upwards, preventing it from descending to the yin, resulting in cold feet. The &quot;Neijing&quot; indeed contains methods for directing what is above to go below; as the pathogen ascends from below, it must be driven downwards, which is a certain principle.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those with mild symptoms, there are no other ailments in the interior, but they experience yellow fluid from the mouth, which flows down through the nasal passages. In contrast, those with severe internal issues and dangerous symptoms must expel the yellow fluid through the openings at the front and back. This should be understood. In the &quot;Jinkui,&quot; under this text, there are an additional twenty-four characters that serve as a warning against inducing sweating. Initially, this was not regarded as a warning, which also requires understanding. However, the difficulty of using purgatives lies in not recognizing the reasons against sweating; thus, the authority to use purgatives is lost. When Zhongjing observed symptoms such as head shaking, mouth shutting, and a rigid back, it indicated a near loss of Yang; if sweating were to be induced at this point, the already weak exterior Yang would worsen, and the chills would become severe. If sweating has already been induced, the pulse feels like a snake, indicating that true Yang is lost, which could lead to death in a moment. Therefore, it is inferred that if excessive dampness leads to severe heat, purgatives are not advisable for recovery. Moreover, if purgatives are used, they must be combined with warming herbs, so that dampness can be expelled without losing Yang along with it. This is not unsubstantiated. Zhongjing emphasizes in this chapter that if purgatives are used and sweat appears on the forehead, slight panting, and small urination occurs, it is a sure sign of death. Is this not a significant warning against losing Yang due to purging?<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

<p>All winds that cause dizziness belong to the liver. If wood predominates, the limbs become stiff and lead to dizziness; if the wind moves upwards, it causes dizziness.

The &quot;Zhou Hou&quot; text states that this is caused by interfacing with water, which may sometimes be observed.

Thus, the turbid energy in the spleen descends into the kidneys, and the colors of water and earth manifest mutually, showing merely a black stagnation within the yellow. If the fire rising from the water combines with the royal fire of the heart, its momentum can scorch the fields, and the color of the smoke and flames first penetrates the forehead, leading to even slight sweating, which follows the fire outward, causing the heart&#39;s essence to be lost externally.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jingyue&#39;s Complete Works</strong> (Ming Dynasty, by Zhang Jieben)</p>
<p><strong>Headache</strong></p>
<p>When diagnosing headaches, one should first assess their duration, then distinguish between external and internal causes. Temporary headaches are usually due to external邪气 (evil influences); chronic headaches are often associated with the decline of the body&#39;s essential energy (元气). For temporary illnesses, if there is an external邪, it is caused by wind and cold invading the channels, and treatment should focus on dispersing the邪, while avoiding methods that clear and descend. If there is an internal邪, it relates to the fire of the three Yang channels being intense within, and treatment should aim to clear and descend, avoiding methods that ascend and disperse. This is the method for treating邪.</p>
<p>For chronic illnesses, the headache may alternatively worsen or improve. It may arise from slight sensations due to a deficiency in the exterior, mild heat from a predominance of Yang, or diminished fluids below allowing虚火 (false fire) to rise, or from a deficiency of Yang above resulting in the dominance of Yin cold. Therefore, for temporary illnesses, one should focus on the邪气; for chronic illnesses, emphasis should be on the元气. This is the foundational principle.</p>
<p>However, there may also be cases of temporary illnesses that are虚 (deficient) or chronic ones that are实 (excess). These should be treated in consideration of the pulse and symptoms, rather than adhering rigidly to a single approach.</p>
<p>Headaches can be further distinguished by the respective channels. When diagnosing headaches caused by external factors, one should observe the three Yang channels and the Jueyin channel, as the three Yang脉 (meridians) all run to the head, and the Jueyin channel also converges at the crown. Thus, in Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; it is indicated that only the three Yang channels have headaches, while the Taiyin and Shaoyin channels do not.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Regarding the methods of diagnosis, even though the head and brain can experience pain, regardless of whether the three Yang channels are involved, it is important to differentiate them. The Taiyang is located at the back, the Yangming at the front, and the Shaoyang at the side; each has its own governing element and should be distinguished in terms of external pathogenic factors. As for internal injuries causing headaches, one should not be constrained by the three Yang channels. As mentioned in the foundational text, when there is deficiency below and excess above, it pertains to the Lesser Yin and Greater Yang; the discussion in the chapter on syncope states that both the six channels in the legs and the lesser Yin and lesser Yang in the arms can be involved. The Treatise on Odd Diseases states: &quot;The brain is Yin. The marrow is the filling of the bones.&quot; Therefore, any pain in the brain could not be other than a disease of the Lesser Yin. This distinction between internal and external should not be overlooked. </p>
<p>For externally contracted headaches, observable exterior signs must be noted, such as chills and fever, a tight and rapid pulse, a runny nose, coughing, soreness in the back, or a stiff neck that prevents turning; all of these indicate the presence of cold evil in the channels. By dispersing the cold evil, the pain will naturally subside. Herbs such as Chuanxiong, Xixin, Vitex, and Chaihu are particularly suitable. If the cold is severe, one should use Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Sheng Jiang, Cong Bai, Zi Su, and Bai Zhi, adjusting the dosage according to the patient&#39;s condition.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Headaches caused by fire evil, although each meridian has its own fire symptoms, are most pronounced in the Yangming, primarily due to the strong stomach fire that ascends to the head and directly affects the head region, resulting in severe pain, a strong pulse, and numerous internal heat signs. If there is throbbing pain in the head without exterior evil, it is certainly fire evil. To treat the fire of Yangming, there is nothing better than Bai Hu Tang, supplemented with Ze Xie, Mu Tong, Sheng Di, and Mai Dong to suppress its high momentum, as this provides the quickest effect. </p>
<p>As for fire in other meridians, one may choose remedies like Shao Yao, Tian Hua Fen, Qin, Lian, Zhi, Yao, Long Dan, and Zhi Zi. However, in treating fire, it is not advisable to use dispersing methods. This is because exterior evil fire can be dispersed, but internal stagnated fire will flare up if allowed to rise, which is to be avoided. </p>
<p>Yin deficiency headaches are also a type related to blood deficiency and are often found in chronic illnesses. The symptoms are usually due to a depletion of water, making it easy for虚火 (xu huo, &quot;false fire&quot;) to arise, leading to pain coupled with heat and other internal heat symptoms. The treatment should primarily focus on tonifying water, employing formulas like Zhi Yin Ba Wei Jian, Jian Jian Yi Yin Jian, or Yu Nu Jian. For mild fire, prescriptions such as Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, Si Wu Tang, San Yin Jian, or Zuo Gui Yin are suitable.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yin deficiency headache corresponds to qi deficiency and can occur in those with a long-standing illness. Symptoms typically include a feeling of heaviness and discomfort, sensitivity to light, aversion to cold, fatigue, and a lack of appetite. The pulse is often weak and fine, and there is a heavy sensation in the head. Pain is exacerbated by cold and dampness, indicating a predominance of yin over yang. Treatment should focus on tonifying yang, using formulas such as Li Yin Decoction, Middle Strength Decoction, Complete Tonifying Decoction, and Qi Tonifying Decoction as options. Alternatively, Wufu Drink or Five Gentlemen Decoction can be used, combined with Chuanxiong, Xixin, and Viburnum, to help elevate yang qi, which is among the best treatments.</p>
<p>Phlegm obstruction headache is mentioned in various classical texts, yet according to my analysis, there must be other accompanying causes. Headache combined with phlegm can occur, but it isn’t necessarily caused by phlegm. Therefore, if phlegm is present, it must be treated as such, observing symptoms like nausea, a sensation of fullness in the chest, and cough with copious phlegm. In these cases, Erchen Decoction, Liu&#39;an Decoction, Harmonizing Stomach Drink, and Pingwei Powder, along with Chuanxiong, Xixin, and Viburnum, should be used primarily. If there is phlegm combined with heat, Qingge Decoction is recommended, or alternatively, Erchen Decoction or Liu&#39;an Decoction with Huangqin and Tianhuafen. If the heat is severe, adding gypsum is also acceptable. For headaches caused by phlegm combined with deficiency, Jinshui Liu Jun Decoction or Liu Junzi Decoction with Chuanxiong and Xixin should be used judiciously.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dizziness</strong></p>
<p>Dizziness can be classified into several causes; those who are deficient account for eight or nine out of ten cases, while those affected by both heat and phlegm represent only one or two. The reasons for this condition include excessive fatigue, irregular eating and drinking times, vomiting that injures the upper organs, diarrhea affecting the lower organs, excessive sweating that depletes energy, disturbances of the mind from fright, persistent worry, mental strain from being insulted or assaulted, and extreme grief or pain manifesting in loud cries; all of these injuries affect the vital essence of yang. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are cases of vomiting blood, nosebleeds, or bloody stools, as well as infections with severe pus, serious injuries from sharp objects causing blood loss, excessive sexual indulgence in men leading to energy depleting with semen, and women experiencing bleeding after childbirth or during abnormal menstruation; these injuries impact the yin that supports yang. </p>
<p>Additionally, excessive drunkenness that combines dampness and heat affects the yin. Extreme anger can drive up the energy of the wood element, causing distress to the qi. Mucus improperly retained in the body, affecting digestion, indicates weakness of the spleen, representing an excess in some areas coupled with a deficiency in others. </p>
<p>Finally, elderly individuals with weakened essence and accumulated fatigue may suddenly suffer insomnia or dizziness, which results from the dual deficiency of the nutritive and defensive energy. From this analysis, one can distinguish between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states, the essence is about emptiness, yet why do later scholars often indulge in their own conjectures? Do their understandings of conditions and the underlying principles of illness truly align? If we follow this guidance, can later students avoid errors? Thus, I have extracted the main points as follows.</p>
<p>The discussion by Hejian on dizziness emphasizes a key statement: all dizziness belongs to the liver wood. This is caused by the wind&#39;s activity. The so-called severe wind leading to dizziness in the head and eyes arises when wood is abundant and metal is weak, unable to restrain wood. Consequently, wood generates fire, and both wind and fire relate to yang, which is inherently active. When these two forms of activity clash, they lead to rotation. Thus, fire is fundamentally active; when flames encounter wind, they naturally swirl. This explains the meaning of wind and wood, which seems plausible.</p>
<p>However, it is not recognized that the essence of the &quot;Key Treatise&quot; discusses the principles related to the movement of qi and organ energy, not solely the condition of dizziness. Only in discussions like the &quot;Oral Inquiry,&quot; &quot;Guarding Qi,&quot; &quot;Decisive Qi,&quot; &quot;Meridian,&quot; and &quot;Sea Treatise&quot; can we find the most relevant arguments. How can Hejian reference none of these, speaking only of wind and fire to support his claim about dizziness? Isn’t this a mistake?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Danxi&#39;s discussion on dizziness states: phlegm is above, and fire is below; the fire rises and moves the phlegm. This indicates that the presence of phlegm is significant; without phlegm, dizziness cannot occur. Even if wind is involved, there must also be phlegm. Those with involved qi deficiency should primarily address phlegm, along with using herbs to tonify qi and reduce fire.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we discuss this argument, then all cases of dizziness must pertain to phlegm syndrome. Why do Xuan and Qi claim it does not involve phlegm and only state that it is due to insufficient upper Qi, causing suffering in the head and dizziness in the eyes? They say that if there is upper deficiency, there is dizziness; if the governor vessel is deficient, the head feels heavy and sways; if the sea of marrow is insufficient, there is turning of the brain and tinnitus leading to dizziness. Are all these not related to phlegm syndrome? Moreover, if the various conditions I listed in the previous chapter are all due to dizziness, can they all be categorized as phlegm syndrome as well? Therefore, Danxi states that without phlegm, dizziness cannot occur, so treatment of phlegm should be prioritized, while also using other medications. I, on the other hand, say that without deficiency, dizziness cannot occur, so treatment of deficiency should be the main focus, while also considering associated signs. Who is correct and who is wrong, I cannot say for certain; I will wait for the wise to clarify. Headache, in this case, is a condition of excessive presence.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of dizziness is attributed to an upper deficiency syndrome. Therefore, the Inner Canon clearly stipulates: headache at the crown indicates excess above and deficiency below. It also states that excess above and deficiency below leads to vertex headache. This is because the pathogenic qi resides above, causing the pain, hence it is termed excess above. In contrast, when discussing dizziness, it mentions that there is insufficient qi above. It also states that an upper deficiency leads to dizziness; it does not speak of excess above. However, subsequent scholars, such as Yan Yonghe and Yang Renzhai, have posited interpretations that include phlegm rising and obstructing the flow of qi, suggesting fatigue from overexertion resulting in upper excess but lower deficiency, and that the kidneys are unable to receive qi, causing qi to rise up disorderly. Zhu Danxi similarly stated there is phlegm above and fire below. All these interpretations speak to the notion of excess above. How could they contradict the Inner Canon so? Alas! This represents the failure of later generations to understand the text.</p>
<p>Regarding dizziness, it can manifest as a heavy head, blackened vision, or a sensation of the brain spinning uncontrollably. The reasoning behind these symptoms simply points to the heavy head being seen as excess above, without realizing that the head is not heavier than in previous times, but rather that one cannot endure its weight more than before. The inability to withstand the burden indicates a deficiency in yang; it is not truly an excess above. What then accounts for the failure of qi to return to its source or for the chaotic ascent of qi? Excess above should subside and be restrained, while deficiency above should not be subjected to further depletion of vitality. This distinction between excess and deficiency is vital and misunderstanding it can lead to harm. </p>
<p>In examining dizziness, whether minor or significant, one can discern the true nature of excess and deficiency.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can it be explained? Nowadays, people with weak constitutions, regardless of age, whether young or old, after fatigue or indulging in wine and pleasure, often experience ringing in the ears like a bell, or dizziness with blurred vision, which quickly subsides; this is a common occurrence. Beyond middle age, one often observes symptoms such as fainting and collapse, which are also quite common. However, when these symptoms appear and disappear suddenly, people generally call it &quot;head disturbance with blurred vision&quot;; if someone collapses and does not regain consciousness, it is often attributed to &quot;stroke or phlegm.&quot; They fail to realize that the temporary cessation is due to the qi and blood not being completely depleted, hence it appears and disappears quickly, which is a mild form of stroke; but a severe collapse indicates a fundamental deficiency, resulting in sudden illness that is hard to recover from, which is a serious form of dizziness. Moreover, such symptoms are typically seen in those beyond middle age, and compared to the young, the severity is even more evident. Observing this, one can discern whether it is truly wind or not, whether it is phlegm or not, and understand the dynamics of deficiency and excess. Why do people nowadays not recognize the underlying mechanisms of these ailments, and merely see dizziness and collapse without speaking of them, attributing it all to wind and phlegm without considering that it may be dissipative or dispersive? I fear that the slightest decline in qi may be subjected to further burdens. It is deeply lamentable.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Treatment</h3>
<p>Dizziness, though related to an upper deficiency, cannot be entirely separated from the lower. The upper deficiency refers to the ultimate yang weakness; the lower deficiency pertains to the yang weakness within yin. For ultimate yang weakness, one should treat the qi, using formulas like the Four Gentlemen Decoction, the Five Gentlemen Brew, the Gui Pi Decoction, or the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. In cases with accompanying vomiting, the Sheng Jiang Decoction with an increase in ginseng and similar ingredients should be applied.</p>
<p>For the yang weakness within yin, one should supplement the essence, using formulas like the Five Blessings Drink, the Seven Blessings Drink, the Left Return Drink, the Right Return Drink, or the Four Substance Decoction. It is essential to understand that depleting the lower will inevitably harm the upper, and nourishing the sprouts must involve watering the roots. Therefore, in treating upper deficiency, it is still crucial to also supplement qi and blood, using formulas like the Major Tonifying Yuan Decoction, the Ten Perfect Tonifying Soup, and various formulas for replenishing yin and yang, all should be used judiciously.</p>
<p>For cases of dizziness, any underlying sources of illness as mentioned in the previous discussion should be treated according to their specific symptoms.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is fire, one should also clear the fire; if there is phlegm, one should clear the phlegm; if there is qi, one should regulate the qi. This depends on the situation and must adapt accordingly. However, it is always important to prioritize treating deficiency and complement this with addressing other issues.</p>
<p>In the ancient methods for treating dizziness and vertigo, careful observation is necessary. Danxi stated that for those with damp phlegm, the Erchen decoction should be used, and for fire, it should be combined with wine and Huangqin. Those with both qi deficiency and fire require first treating the phlegm while using qi-regulating herbs to reduce fire, such as the Dongyuan Banxia Baizhu Tianma decoction.</p>
<p>For dizziness that cannot be resisted, prepare a powder of Dahuang stir-fried in wine and take it with tea infusion. When fire stirs phlegm, use Erchen decoction and add Huangqin, Cangzhu, and Qianghuo to dispel wind and eliminate dampness. </p>
<p>It is noted that if there is early morning dizziness that stabilizes shortly and occurs as a daily routine, one should use Zhengyuan powder and Xiaheixidan. </p>
<p>For food injury causing dizziness, add Chuanxiong to the Shen Zhuo decoction, named Chushi decoction. Those with phlegm should use Qingzhou Baowanzi.</p>
<p>I believe the ancient method for treating dizziness, such as the Banxia Baizhu Tianma decoction, treats spleen phlegm. The Erchen decoction with Huangqin treats heat phlegm. The Qingzhou Baowan treats wind phlegm and cold phlegm. The Shen Zhuo decoction treats kidney phlegm. Additionally, the use of Dahuang powder for dizziness is suitable only for phlegm-fire obstruction. The heavy fall from Heixidan is suitable only when qi is abundant above. However, one should be cautious, as cases of dizziness may involve substantial phlegm and fire, but are not solely due to excessive conditions above. It is essential to carefully assess whether these ancient formulas are appropriate for use.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Manuscript of the Stone Chamber: Treatment for Headaches</strong></p>
<p>The common method of treatment is to address the condition according to established practices. For example, if a person suffers from a headache, one should use the typical treatments for headaches. There is no need to treat it by addressing the feet, even if there are cases where treating the feet may lead to relief; however, one must generally use established methods first before attempting alternative treatments. Therefore, when a headache arises, take five qian of Chuanxiong, one qian each of Baizhi, Manjingzi, Licorice, Banxia, and Xixin, and the ailment will be dispelled instantly.</p>
<p>For upper treatments, which address issues with the upper burner, such as headaches caused by wind invading the Taiyang channel, use one qian each of Chuanxiong, Xixin, Baizhi, Chaihu, Banxia, and Licorice, along with three qian of Shaoyao. Although wind affects the Taiyang, the treatment need not entirely focus on it; the key is to clear the evil. Thus, Baizhi, Chuanxiong, and Xixin are used to disperse the wind, while Baishao, Licorice, and Chaihu help clear the fire from the liver and gallbladder, as these channels connect to the head. Additionally, Banxia is included to eliminate phlegm, and Licorice harmonizes the ingredients together to achieve efficacy. </p>
<p>As another remedy for headaches, use one liang of Chuanxiong and two qian of Manjingzi, decoct in water and drink to achieve immediate relief.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chuanxiong nourishes the blood, and Manjingzi dispels wind. For those who treat ailments, such as headaches, there is no need to resort to drastic measures. For headache relief, use one liter of yellow wine, add one tael of Xixin and one tael of Bai Zhi, and brew it to intoxication for a cure. </p>
<p>These treatment methods are unknown to most, and few dare to use them; hence I provide guidance today. When headaches persist for years, the evil is deeply rooted in the brain. How can a few cents&#39; worth of powdered medicine reach the crown and penetrate into the brain? You must use ample Xixin, Chuanxiong, and Bai Zhi to disperse it effectively. Some may fear that using too many herbs will deplete genuine qi, worried that the headache won&#39;t go away before the genuine qi runs out. But little do they know, the wind evil resides in the head; to successfully eradicate it, one must use ample wind-dispelling herbs. If there is illness, one must bear it; what is there to fear? A single bout of intoxication can cure it. This remedy is trustworthy and not to be doubted. </p>
<p>However, after recovery, it is essential to take five qian each of Shudi, Shaoyao, and Danggui, one qian of Chuanxiong, and three qian each of Shanzhuyu and Maidong, decocted in water and taken in four doses for optimal effect. When someone suffers from a headache, they often believe it to be wind in the head, not recognizing it could also be due to insufficient kidney water, allowing evil fire to surge into the brain, causing what seems like a headache but is not truly one.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Treating only the wind will exacerbate the pain. The method should primarily strengthen the kidney water, and the headache will naturally resolve. The formula includes one tael each of cooked rehmannia and astragalus, four qian of cornelian cherry, two qian each of northen five-flavor fruit and ophiopogon, and three qian each of radix scrophulariae, ligusticum, angelica, and yam; just two doses will cure it. This formula is remarkable because it treats the kidney while not directly addressing the wind, and even more so because it simultaneously treats the liver. If the liver wood is unbalanced, then the lung metal loses its transformative power, resulting in diminished kidney water. Now, by nourishing both the liver and the kidney, they support each other, naturally clearing the head and eyes. Moreover, with the addition of ophiopogon and five-flavor fruit to nourish the lung metal&#39;s clarity and purging function, the throat is thus soothed.</p>
<p>For headaches with a divine formula, use one tael each of ligusticum and glehnia, two qian of vine-growing plant, and five qian of asarum, with two bowls of water. Boil until two-thirds remains, add half a bowl of yellow wine, mix well, and take each morning; one dose will ensure the pain never returns. This formula is exceptional due to the inclusion of glehnia, which nourishes the yin and typically does not enter the brain. However, when added to ligusticum, and combined with vine-growing plant and asarum, it directly targets the crown of the head. Since glehnia cannot descend, it must cooperate with the others to enter the brain. Head pain is due to wind caused by the deficiency of yin in the brain, resulting in it being trapped and unable to leave.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now, if you apply this remedy to the brain, the wind will not be able to remain, and the pain in the brain will heal on its own, and the headache will also be relieved. This method not only treats headaches but also addresses brain pain, with no exception of efficacy. </p>
<p>For headache symptoms, simply crush one seed of castor bean, mix it with a little jujube flesh, and make it into a ball the size of a yellow bean. Wrap it in fine silk and insert it into the nostril. In a short while, clear mucus will flow out; then remove the ball, and do not leave it inside for long. The headache will then be cured and will never recur. However, if left too long, it will inevitably cause the brain&#39;s essence to flow out, leading to an incurable condition. Remember, remember!</p>
<p>If a person has a headache, the method should be to use a light and clear mouth for slight dispersion, which will be effective. For instance, the method of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is such. However, many are unaware of the principle of lightness and heaviness in this decoction. I will further refine it to be a lasting model. The ingredients are: Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, and Gan Cao, each one penny, and Ren Shen five fen, for this is the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. I suggest adding another five fen of Ren Shen and two qian of Fu Ling for even more miraculous effects, as sufficient Qi makes it easier for evils to exit and sweat to be produced. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment for Head Pain</h3>
<p>For head pain, use one liter of yellow wine, three taels of white spoon (a type of herb), three qian each of magnolia flower and platycodon, five qian each of (wood) plum pits, dwarf lilyturf, and bupleurum, one qian of licorice, and three bowls of water. Prepare it as a decoction, then add the yellow wine and drink it; one bout of drunkenness will cure it. If the dosage is correct, drink again with wine, ensuring it leads to drunkenness.</p>
<p>Head pain arises from wind entering the gallbladder meridian. Since the gallbladder is connected to the brain, that is why there is head pain. Some believe that using too much bupleurum is overly dispersive, not realizing that white peony can harmonize it, preventing the Qi from dispersing while still allowing the dispelling of pathogens. Magnolia flower and (wood) plum pits are excellent for the gallbladder, while platycodon and licorice are wonderful medicines for the lungs. How can gallbladder issues also treat the lungs? It is not understood that the nose connects to the brain; when the brain is hot, it must lead to a flow of clear fluids, which if prolonged, will lead to nasal congestion. By treating the lungs simultaneously, the lung Qi becomes clear and orderly, allowing the excess energy of the gallbladder to stabilize, thus preventing clear fluids from flowing downward. This is the marvelous efficacy of this prescription.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head and Horn Sores</strong></p>
<p>If a person has sores on the head and horns, on that day the head feels heavy like a mountain; on the second day, it will turn blue and purple; by the third day, if the blue spreads to the body, death will occur. This is caused by toxic gas attacking the heart. This illness is often caused by the excessive consumption of spring medicines. Indeed, preparations like spring medicines are merely pills that, when taken, strengthen yang energy and increase vitality. Without using hot medicines, how can this arise? The most potent hot medicines in the world are no other than Aconite and Alpinia Galanga. Both are extremely toxic, and Alpinia Galanga must be calcined before entering a formula, as it is extremely drying, naturally depleting bodily fluids. Moreover, those who excessively indulge to please women will have their sinews, bones, and blood all stirred up. After prolonged indulgence, it will surely lead to significant depletion of essence; as fluids diminish, fire energy becomes more intense. Over time, such indulgence inevitably results in great toxicity, causing fire energy to rise, which is why it frequently manifests in the head and solar region. </p>
<p>At the onset, if the head feels heavy like a mountain, it indicates this serious condition. There is no time to hesitate; quickly take one pound of honeysuckle and boil it into a decoction, drinking dozens of bowls, which can partially alleviate the poison and preserve life. Yet one cannot escape the ulceration of the sores. Then, use three taels each of honeysuckle and Scrophularia, two taels of Angelica, and one tael of raw licorice to make a decoction, taking one dose per day for seven days, after which the sores will begin to converge and heal. This kind of illness is quite prevalent in the world, yet people are most unwilling to refrain from consuming spring medicines—how lamentable!<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Li Yin Decoction</strong>: This is a modified formula of the Li Zhong Tang. Whenever there is a deficiency in the spleen and kidneys leading to symptoms such as dizziness and circulatory issues, if it is suitable for a strong, dry treatment, one should use formulas similar to Li Zhong’s Six Jun herbs; if it requires warmth and moisture, one should use formulas similar to Li Yin Da Ying. To understand how to properly bolster, one must first observe this.</p>
<p>This formula is effective in treating true yin deficiency, fullness and distention, nausea and vomiting, phlegm and water retention, vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain, and symptoms of women such as delayed menstruation and blood stasis.</p>
<p>Moreover, for those with insufficient true yin, or those who are generally overworked and fatigued, and suddenly catch a cold evil that cannot be dispelled, or experience fever, body aches, facial redness and a scorched tongue, or feel thirsty yet do not desire hot drinks, or have a sensitivity to cold in the back, heart, and limbs, while the pulse appears weak—these are all indications of false heat. If one were to attack with cold and cool treatments, it would be fatal. One should promptly use this formula, making adjustments thereafter to warm and tonify the yin, disperse the exterior evil, taking several doses to gradually nourish the yin qi; thus, the sweat will emerge from the yin, and the cold evil will disperse on its own. This is essential for timely application, with divine effects that cannot be fully described.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooked Rehmannia, 3, 5, or 7 qian (about 9-21 grams) or 1-2 liang (about 30-60 grams)</li>
<li>Angelica sinensis, 2-3 qian (about 6-9 grams) or 5-7 qian (about 15-21 grams)</li>
<li>Dry ginger, roasted until yellow, 1-2-3 qian (about 3-9 grams)</li>
<li>Honey-fried licorice, 1-2 qian (about 3-6 grams)</li>
<li>Water, 2 zhong (about 400 ml), decocted to 7-8 portions, taken hot. Optionally, add cinnamon 1-2 qian (about 3-6 grams).</li>
</ul>
<p>If this formula increases with Aconite, it is then called Aconite Li Yin Decoction; if it adds Ginseng, it is referred to as Six Flavor Regain Yang Drink, treating conditions of declining Ming Men fire and lack of yang in the yin.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is first exposed to the cold wind and feels symptoms without deep invasion of pathogens, such as fever and body aches, with a pulse that is rapid but not forceful, and there are no signs of internal fire, those who are generally deficient should take this decoction. Add one and a half or two qian of Chaihu, and take one or two doses; its effect is remarkable. If cold has condensed and yin is abundant, and the pathogen is difficult to resolve, one must certainly add one or two qian of Mahuang, and use it confidently; or it may be taken without Chaihu, lest it be too purging. This is the first formula to warm and disperse the cold pathogen, known only to Zhongjing. His warming and dispersing methods primarily use Mahuang and Guizhi decoctions. Others use variations with the Li Yin decoction or the Da Wen Zhong drink for adjustments. Although these target different aspects—one focusing on yang and the other on yin—their effects are interconnected, acting outwardly and inwardly, and use of warmth is fundamental. Students should adjust according to the needs at hand.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a></p></div>

If there is Yin deficiency with excess heat, characterized by internal heat, it is inappropriate to use warming remedies. If both Qi and blood are deficient and the pathogen cannot be dispelled, one should avoid ginger and cinnamon and instead adjust the two ingredients alone, or simply add ginseng. </p>
<p>If treating a deficiency of both the spleen and limbs, with water accumulation leading to phlegm, causing either vomiting or bloating, one should add 1.5 qian of fuling (Poria) to the previous formula, or add 0.5 qian of baijieshi (White mustard seed) to promote its movement. </p>
<p>For persistent diarrhea or kidney issues, use a small amount of danggui (Angelica), or remove it entirely, adding ingredients such as shanyao (Chinese yam), biandong (Hyacinth bean), wuzhuyu (Evodia), poguzhi (Plantago), roudoukou (Nutmeg), and fuzi (Aconite).

The root causes are not deep, and the symptoms are on the surface, with the pulse often floating, and pain in the skin and flesh.

<p>Preparation: Grind the ingredients and first decoct 1 jin of Atractylodes in 5 sheng of water, until reduced to 3 sheng. Remove the Atractylodes dregs, then add the aforementioned 12 ingredients and further decoct until yielding 3 to 4 cups of clear liquid. This should be divided into 3 or 4 doses to be taken throughout the day. Additionally, another decoction can be made from the Atractylodes dregs, straining it to follow the same decoction method with the remaining 12 ingredients. This formula clears away dampness and stagnant heat, balancing the stomach qi. </p>
<p>If symptoms persist, a half-dose may be used. In cases of constipation or irritability, a small amount of Huanglian Decoction can be taken. If there is slight diarrhea and the irritability has passed, a half-dose of the internal reinfusion powder can be taken.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Garlic Moxibustion Method</strong>: Treats all kinds of sores and toxins, whether they cause great pain or no pain at all, or even numbness. If pain decreases with moxibustion, then continue until it is numb; if it is numb, then increase moxibustion until it causes pain. The toxin will disperse with the fire, allowing for the smooth removal of stagnant toxins. This is a method for treatment and has the power to revive. </p>
<p>Peel the garlic, slice it about the thickness of three coins, and place it on the sore. Use strong moxa on the garlic and perform moxibustion three times, then replace the garlic and continue moxibustion. If the sore has not yet fully formed, it will disperse; if it is fully formed, it will still weaken its force and cause no harm. For larger sores, pound the garlic into a paste and apply it to the affected area, then place moxa on top and burn it. Replace the garlic when it becomes scorched. If there is no pain or pus doesn’t form, or if it is a Yin sore, it is especially advisable to perform moxibustion more frequently. If moxibustion still does not bring pain, pus, or any sign of formation, it indicates a severe deficiency of Qi and blood and should not be treated.</p>

<p>For the upper grade, it removes eighteen types of hemorrhoids; for the middle grade, it addresses five leaks, transforming flower tumors and gas cores; for the lower grade, it treats numbness, leaking sores, and back abscesses, among other conditions. This is the ancient method of the three-grade pill, with the same medicinal ingredients divided into two distinct uses, hence the differentiation in treatment. </p>
<p>Now, regarding the method for a single lance in this formula: it can be used for ailments of the three grades or higher, as they all correspond to it. Furthermore, the medicinal ingredients are simple and not cumbersome, which is what is termed the saying of the three-grade single lance.</p>

<li>Xinshi (trust stone) 1.5 liang </li>

</ul>
<p>Middle grade: </p>

<li>Realgar 1 qian </li>
<li>Frankincense 2.5 qian </li>
<li>Myrrh 2.5 qian</li>
</ul>
<p>The alumen and Xinshi are ground into a fine powder, placed in a small container, and baked over charcoal until red-hot. Once the blue smoke dissipates, white smoke rises. After a brief period, when it turns red throughout, the fire is extinguished, and the container is taken out and left to settle overnight. About 1 liang of the purified powder of alumen and Xinshi is then mixed with 2.4 qian of realgar and 1.2 qian of frankincense, and ground very finely. </p>
<p>This is then mixed into a thick paste, rolled into thin strips, and dried in the shade. When using it for cases with holes, insert it into the holes. For those without holes, first prick the area with a needle. Apply the medicine twice a day, morning and evening, for three days. For larger holes, apply about ten strips each time, continuing for seven days until the medicine fills the hole adequately. </p>
<p>Afterward, the surrounding area will naturally open up significantly, around fourteen days later. The cores of the sores, lumps, and hemorrhoids will naturally fall off. Wash with medicinal broth and apply a jade-red ointment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After the appropriate number of days have passed, place the mixture into a clean large pot and simmer it over a low fire until the medicinal residue floats to the surface, indicating that it has thickened. Stop the fire momentarily and use a cloth bag to filter out the dregs, measuring the oil to the precise amount needed. Clean the pot thoroughly, then use fine silk to filter the oil back into the pot, ensuring cleanliness for the best results. </p>
<p>Add any leftover blood and simmer slowly until it rises to the surface. Use a willow stick to stir; when it appears to have a melting paste-like consistency, it is considered properly cooked. For every pound of clean oil, add six and a half ounces of yellow lead oxide gradually, increasing the heat slightly. In the heat of summer and autumn, add five more ounces of lead for every pound of oil. </p>
<p>Continue stirring without pause and wait for the pot to first emit green smoke, followed by successive rising clouds of white smoke with a fragrant aroma. At this point, the paste is finished, and you can stop the fire. </p>
<p>Drop a bit of the paste into water to test its softness and firmness, adjusting with more cooked oil if it seems too hard or with more lead if it&#39;s too soft, each in small amounts. Gradually increase the heat, ensuring suitable texture for both winter and summer. </p>
<p>Once the smoke dissipates, remove the pot from the heat and add asafoetida, cutting it into thin slices and spreading it over the surface of the paste to fully dissolve; then add a light powder of myrrh and mix well. Pour this into water, using the willow stick to form it into a block. Then switch to cold water for soaking. At a warm temperature, take half a pound of the paste, stretch and twist it until it forms a block. Once again, switch to cold water for soaking. Whenever you need to use it, take a piece, melt it in a copper ladle as needed, and spread it out as desired for optimal results.<a id="trans-297p" href="#orig-297p" class="marker">[297p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Use nine stalks of green onions, including the white part, and boil them in a tea kettle to make a broth. Take a pill of the medicine, dissolve it in the hot broth, and take it all at once. Cover up to induce sweating for effect. If sweating is delayed after taking the medicine, use the green onion broth again to promote it. Sweating will then occur profusely, gradually leading to the removal of covering garments, and the sweat will naturally subside. The patient will feel refreshed and the illness will dissipate. However, if the illness has not fully developed, it will fade immediately; if it has developed, there will be swelling and purulence. </p>
<p>For conditions lacking external symptoms and not requiring dispersal, simply use hot wine to dissolve the medicine. This formula is originally recorded in the Treatise on Wind and Abscesses, and I have always used it to disperse snake poison, with very quick results, hence it is transcribed here. </p>
<p>Upon careful examination of this formula, it is notably effective in treating swellings and abscesses because all sores arise from the imbalance of the defensive and nourishing qi, causing stagnation of qi and blood, which leads to boils and swellings. This medicine&#39;s nature is to specifically disperse and can also regulate qi, dispel wind, and clear the meridians, effectively resolving blockages. Moreover, since sores and toxins accumulate over time, they can only be resolved by gentle warmth and spicy heat to induce sweating and relief, achieving the intended outcome. </p>
<p>After taking the medicine, avoid wind and consume light porridge. Avoid cold foods and sexual activity. Pregnant women should not take this.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a></p></div>

<p>Mint treats headaches from wind and also those from wind-heat. It is a crucial herb for clearing the upper parts of the body, and both decocting and consuming it in powder form are equally good. Gypsum treats headaches from heat and Yangming-type headaches effectively. Mixing gypsum, chuanxiong, and baizhi in equal parts into a powder, each three qian, and adjusting with tea to take, is called Gypsum Powder. </p>

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: In the case of febrile diseases starting from the head, acupuncture at the occiput and taiyang point can stop sweating.<br>For stabbing the head, one should target the middle of the brain; piercing into the brain causes death.<br>Practitioners do not diagnose by listening to patients talk about head ailments; any pain in the head is treated with acupuncture to the stored points, avoiding harm to bones, flesh, or skin. The skin is the pathway.<br>The Yellow Emperor asks: I have heard that wind is the onset of a hundred diseases. How should it be treated with needles? Qibo responds: Wind enters from the outside, causing chills, sweating, headache, body heaviness, and aversion to cold; it should be treated at the Fengfu point, adjusting Yin and Yang. If deficient, it should be supplemented; if excessive, it should be drained.<br>Evil Qi attacking the foot&#39;s taiyang channel causes pain in the head, neck, and shoulders. Acupuncture is then done at the small toe nail, targeting each point to prompt immediate relief. If it persists, puncture beneath the outer ankle at three points, alternating sides; relief will come as soon as you eat.<br>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: For diseases in the upper part, one should treat from below; for diseases in the lower part, one should treat from above. For head ailments, treat from the foot; for waist issues, treat at the knee pit.<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Severe headache, intense pain in the head, the brain aches completely, hands and feet cold to the joints, and death if untreated. Headaches should not be relieved by acupuncture at specific points; if there has been an impact causing bruising, there is stagnant blood within. If there is pain from a flesh injury that hasn&#39;t resolved, one may use needles, but it should not be done from a distance. For headaches that cannot be needled, severe arthralgia presents as a malignancy; daily occurrences may lead to slight improvement, but it must not be disregarded. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, the Yangming is characterized by a surplus of blood and a deficiency of qi. The related points are: Liyuan, Neiting, Xiangu, Chongyang, and Jiexi. When the issue emanates from the brain, the person initially feels an unbearable headache, often as if it would develop into an ulcer. The brain is the sea of marrow; therefore, moxibustion and acupuncture should be employed to dispel the pathogenic qi. The brain, being a dwelling, indicates that if the pulse is floating, it comes from the Taiyang channel; if it is long, it derives from the Yangming channel; if it is wiry, it originates from the Shaoyang channel. </p>
<p>It is said: Each channel has its respective Jing, Ying, Yu, and He points. Jing points are related to fullness under the heart and ulcers of a dark color; Ying points relate to heat in the body and red ulcers; Yu points pertain to heaviness in the body and painful joints, with yellow ulcers; the Jing points are connected to coughs, chills, and fevers, and white ulcers; He points involve counterflow qi and black ulcers. If there are signs corresponding to the channels&#39; diseases, moxibustion or acupuncture may be indicated to dispel the pathogenic qi. </p>
<p>The text states that when pathogenic qi accumulates internally, it causes swelling and heat, and it should be treated with stone needles. The Inner Canon states: For stagnant qi that obstructs breathing, it is best to open it with needles; if qi overwhelms blood and results in accumulation, stones should be used to release it. Wang&#39;s commentary adds that &#39;stones&#39; refer to needles, which can break up large abscesses and expel pus.<a id="trans-358p" href="#orig-358p" class="marker">[358p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now use (Jinfei) needles instead. For sores that have already begun to swell and harden slightly, with unchanged skin color and a deep pulse that is not painful, one should perform external moxibustion to draw out the evil qi and alleviate the condition. If there is pus, moxibustion should not be used; rather, one should prick it. If it is superficial, moxibustion is also not advisable. The Classics say: For concave areas, perform moxibustion. If there is slight hardness that does not cause pain, urgent moxibustion should be applied, as the evil qi is deeply embedded. Do not perform moxibustion on superficial issues; proceed with caution. </p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shipin&quot; states: For large head ailments, use a stone needle to prick the swollen area to draw out blood, and it will be effective. </p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: For head wind and headaches, pricking Baihui will bring immediate relief. Additionally, apply moxibustion to Shenting, Qianting, Shangxing, and Baihui. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The note explains that the previous reference pertains to the bladder meridian, indicating either damp-heat blockage or upward fire of yin. If due to damp-heat, there is excess pathogenic energy and insufficient source energy; the prescription would be Huanglian Jiedu San to eliminate damp toxins and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to nourish the source. If due to yin fire, both source and pathogenic energies are inadequate; the prescription would be Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If kidney water is depleted, and the condition is severe, urgently use Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to consolidate the foundation and guide fire back to its source. If discoloration is dark without suppuration, or if there is suppuration without healing, this is termed &quot;Neurophlogosis&quot; and is untreatable. Generally, if there is severe swelling and pain, it is advisable to use Huoming Drink and perform garlic moxibustion to break up stagnant blood and draw out toxic accumulations, though the moxa should be small and few. If one wishes for it to form pus and ulcerate, and to regenerate flesh and promote healing, use Tuo Li as the primary approach.

<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: For headache guidance and manipulation techniques: at the Baihui point, dig in 64 degrees, rubbing as counted, and also perform the posterior exercises. </p>
<p>For the exercises: if the pain is on the left, envision a large tendon below the left breast and pull it over to the right breast; if the pain is on the right, pull it over to the left breast, performing each for twelve degrees. For headaches: focus on the navel and push down to the Yongquan point. </p>
<p>For a heavy head and blurry vision, the guidance is: observe emptiness, sit still and hold your breath, using both palms to cover the ears and beat a heavenly drum; next, rub the Yongquan point; then press the knees with the hands and sit upright, exhaling nine breaths, establishing focused intention. </p>
<p>For the exercises: focus on a tranquil state, tongue against the upper palate, wait for saliva to gradually accumulate, swallow it frequently, and return the focus to the navel, rolling the eyes, which will lead to a light head and clear vision. </p>
<p>For headaches, brain pain, and phlegm stagnation guidance: sit with a single knee raised, placing two fingers to block the ears and the seven orifices (mouth, eyes, nose); bend forward slightly with gentle force to allow true qi to rise, dispersing brain evil. </p>
<p>For the exercises: focus on the navel, envision the pain on the head, dividing it to circulate to the heart and opening downward; visualize rotating the navel wheel to open the pathways, tightening your intent to move through the phlegm-stagnated area, circulating energy throughout the abdomen while focusing on the navel.<a id="trans-363p" href="#orig-363p" class="marker">[363p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of guiding the spirit and energy: This condition is caused by emotional desires harming the body, leading to weakened qi and diminished blood, with heart fire attacking upwards, phlegm and fluids obstructing the lungs. When this condition persists over time, it may develop into consumption. At the shoulder well point, perform the manipulation 99 times, with similar rubbing, combined with later methods for self-healing.</p>
<p>For energy manipulation: Close the lower orifices tightly, calm the spirit and repress qi, pressing on the head and ears. The practitioner should be seated firmly, with bent legs and feet uncrossed, allowing the spirit and qi to return naturally, leading to the secretion of fluids, and swallowing will stabilize the mind.</p>
<p>For recovery from dizziness: Work on the shoulder well and hip ring points, performing the manipulation 99 times each, with reliance on natural healing.</p>
<p>For energy work: Press urgently on the ear gates and the forehead, while also restricting the crown point to stabilize the spirit. If the qi turns back, the heart will feel refreshed; care should be taken to delay speaking to secure the vital essence.</p>
<p>For vertigo: Close the mouth, stabilize the spirit, suppress qi, and press on the forehead and ear openings. Practitioners of significant skill should keep their feet bent and not allow them to stretch out, for fear that the qi may become difficult to regulate. This allows swallowing of fluids, opening the major orifices, ensuring the spirit remains present, allowing one to quickly regain awareness of worldly matters.</p>
<p>For the method of releasing the fetus, press on the crown point to send qi down to the elixir field. There are also those who lose consciousness; in such cases, one should press on the crown point.</p>
<p>For pear skin sores: Take water from the Yongquan point, washing up from the foot ribs to the sore on the top of the head; it can be cleared in a month. Additionally, guide downwards from the face to the toes, performing this 24 times each session. Young practitioners can recite the four characters &quot;Three Teachings Masters;&quot; this method is also applicable for adults who appear flushed.<a id="trans-364p" href="#orig-364p" class="marker">[364p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Moxuan Manlu&quot; states: Wang Wengong, serving as a minister, was presenting matters in the hall when he suddenly felt an unbearable pain in his temples. He urgently submitted a request to return for treatment. The magistrate of Yuling was resting in the central office at that time. After a while, a small attendant brought a small golden cup with a little medicine and said: &quot;If the pain is on the left, pour it into the right nostril; if it is on the right, do the reverse; if both sides are painful, pour it into both nostrils.&quot; Immediately, the pain was relieved. The next day, upon expressing gratitude, the emperor said: &quot;Since the time of Taizu, there have been several such remedies kept within the palace, not to be transmitted outside; this is one of them.&quot; Consequently, he also presented this remedy. Su Shi, returning from Huangzhou, passed by Jinling, where Anshi shared this remedy, using it with miraculous effect. However, when the eyes turned red for a brief moment, the headache was also cured. The method involves using fresh radish, extracting the natural juice, adding a little raw dragon’s brain, and mixing it well; then tilting the head back and having someone drip it into the nostrils.<a id="trans-365p" href="#orig-365p" class="marker">[365p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In &quot;Truncated Farming Records,&quot; it is said: Ren Zizao mentioned that while living in the capital, the son of a neighbor suffered from unbearable headaches. A returning Muslim physician used a knife to cut open his forehead, extracting a small crab that was as hard as stone but still able to move. Shortly thereafter, it died, and the pain subsided. They managed to obtain the crab, which is still kept to this day. Xia Xue Suo remarked: I once saw a guest&#39;s horse at the Changmen of Pingjiang with a swollen belly collapsed on the ground. An old Muslim happened to be present in the inn and cut a small piece from inside its left leg without knowing what it was. The horse then promptly got up and rode away.

<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Filial Piety,&quot; it is stated: A monk from Danxia suffered from headaches, often staying in a dark room, afraid to see the light. His head was hot and painful, so he wrapped a cloth around it and placed ice inside, changing it several times a day, but the heat could not be quelled. Various doctors failed to diagnose the condition, so he sought the help of a Dai person. The Dai said: This is because the Triple Yang Meridians are retaining heat. He then set charcoal fire in a warm room to induce sweating and vomiting, employing all three methods. Only after seven days did he recover. The monk remarked to his followers: This is indeed the hand of a celestial being.<a id="trans-366p" href="#orig-366p" class="marker">[366p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Peng Wu Zhang, an elderly man over sixty, suffered from heat and fainting spells accompanied by headaches. He had been taking purgatives for a month and was additionally affected by the heat. His organs were weakened due to age, leading to his collapse outside in the sunlight, leaving him unaware of his surroundings. His family was alarmed and wanted to shake him awake. The doctor advised against disturbing him, saying, “This would be a grave mistake.” Instead, he provided him with cool watermelon and honeyed water, and shortly after, the man recovered. It is likely that, due to his old age and purging, his pulse was easily disturbed, and his body was overheated while also exposed to the sun, resulting in his fainting. Disturbing him would worsen the situation. The key was to calm his spirit, using cool water to treat him, allowing time for rest. With tranquility, he would naturally get better. If treated hastily by other doctors, this would lead to confusion, clearly demonstrating the doctor&#39;s expertise.</p>
<p>There was a woman over forty who suffered from pain above her forehead and around her ears, experiencing migraines for five to seven years. Each episode caused her bowels to dry and become impacted, her eyes turning red, dizzy, and unable to see far. She had taken many so-called headache treatments like “head wind pills and white dragon pills,” which only slightly alleviated her pain while causing her constipation and worsening her vision. She had undergone numerous acupuncture treatments over the years, and her sight was now in jeopardy due to the illness, leading to infertility. One day, she consulted the doctor again, who examined her pulse. It was rapid and strong, indicating a severe presence of wind and heat. Having observed numerous patients over the past forty or fifty years, I recognized that in both men and women suffering from migraines, there was always significant constipation and hard stools connected with the ailment.<a id="trans-367p" href="#orig-367p" class="marker">[367p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is nothing other than headaches or pain at the temples, which are due to the relationship of the Sanjiao&#39;s fire and the Yangming dryness of metal. The dryness of metal, when it overcomes the liver, causes liver qi to stagnate. When liver qi stagnates, the flow of qi and blood becomes obstructed; when qi and blood are obstructed, there is no communication between upper and lower, leading to internal dryness and ultimately resulting in loss of vision. </p>
<p>To treat this, use the Dà Chéng Qì Tāng (Major Order the Qi Decoction), prepare it with three taels of river water, add one tael of brine, boil it until ready, allow it to cool slightly, and then divide it into three to five doses. Take all doses continuously to wash away the accumulated dryness and heat in the intestines, resulting in very liquid bowel movements, over twenty times. </p>
<p>Next, take Qī Xuān Wán (Seven Heralding Pill) and Shén Gōng Wán (Divine Efficacy Pill) to nourish and moisten. Prepare a soup with spinach, arrowhead, sunflower sprouts, and pig or sheep blood to lubricate. After five to ten days, if the weather is clear and bright, take one dose of Dà Chéng Qì Tāng at night, and this will reduce the pain as the bowel movements become more frequent. After three doses, the eyes will clear and the heavy feeling will lift, leading to recovery. Later, three sons were born.<a id="trans-368p" href="#orig-368p" class="marker">[368p]</a></p></div>

On the eighteenth day, he finally expelled pus, after which he underwent treatment with either medicine or acupuncture. It took three months for healing to begin, yet by April, it had returned to an unfavorable state. He recalled a medical text indicating that when pus appears in a sore, the chances of survival are slim. Taking the physician&#39;s words to heart, he sought out Li Ming for a diagnosis, who suggested that due to the changes from rich foods, it was inappropriate to use the Five Spice, and that he should adopt a fire attack strategy first before proceeding with medications.<a id="trans-370p" href="#orig-370p" class="marker">[370p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When affected by cold pathogens, one must avoid salty foods; the main treatment consists of bitter cold substances, with sweet cold as an assistant. Hot alcohol serves as a medium to warm the Qi and blood. The use of strong warm spices helps to resolve blockages, employing three strong and three sweet agents to enhance original Qi and harmonize the blood vessels, facilitating the expulsion of dampness from alcohol.</p>
<p>To support the autumn season, we enhance Qi and dispel fire, incorporating the medicines from the classic text to harmonize the blood, using main herbs such as Huang Qin, Huang Lian, Huang Bo, Sheng Di Huang, and Zhi Mu processed with wine. From the classic text, Qiang Huo, Du Huo, Gao Ben, Fang Feng, Fang Ji, Dang Gui, and Lian Qiao are used to resolve blockages. Astragalus, ginseng, and licorice complement the bitter cold herbs at a ratio of one third; exceeding this nourishes the Qi and replenishes the body. </p>
<p>Raw licorice clears kidney fire and replenishes the lower jiao source Qi, while ginseng and orange peel nourish the stomach. Sappan wood and Dang Gui help remove stagnant blood; Sheng Di Huang replenishes blood, while Fang Ji processed with wine eliminates retained heat in the bladder. Ze Xie assists in autumn by dispelling damp heat from alcohol.</p>
<p>All these herbs must include Jie Geng as a vehicle to prevent sinking. After administration, no pain should occur from sores, and bodily health remains intact. If taken as advised, one may fall into a deep sleep, waking only at dawn. Upon examination, swelling decreases by seventy to eighty percent, and the sores should scab over completely within fourteen days. </p>
<p>While traditional medicine employs techniques with tangible results, beyond mere efficacy, it can also navigate the unspoken mysteries of the body.

After further sweating, his condition deteriorated, and his headaches intensified, leading him to return home. Whenever he visited local areas, he called for physicians and took medicine, but the pain was severe, and he could not lie down comfortably. He was sensitive to wind and cold, and he did not want to eat. Upon examining his six pulses, they were thin and weak, with short and rapid breathing, and he spoke with fatigue. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In spring, illness manifests in the head. Due to age and weakness, the clear energy cannot rise to the head and face, causing dizziness and gloom. This illness originally had no exterior pathogen; excessive sweating caused a further depletion of clear yang energy, which could not spring up to nourish, and therefore he suffered from headaches and sensitivity to wind and cold, with shortness of breath and aversion to food. It is appropriate to use warm and pungent herbs.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This year, the Qi is high but weak, coupled with excessive sweating, resulting in a further depletion of the defensive Qi. Therefore, Astragalus, sweet and warm, is the ruler to tonify the Wei and strengthen the exterior; Ginseng, sweet and warm, and Angelica, spicy and warm, are used to nourish the blood and Qi and serve as the minister; Atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and roasted licorice, bitter and sweet, warm the stomach Qi, generate Yang Qi, and support the exterior and skin as assistants; Bupleurum and Cimicifuga, bitter and neutral, elevate the lesser Yang and Yangming Qi, open the hundred vessels, and nourish the entire body. Chuanxiong, Vitex, and Asarum, spicy and warm, are light and clear to open the orifices, serving as envoys. In the spring of next year, when summoned to Liupan Mountain, Dr. Cao generously offered an ancient poem; Li Ming of Dongyuan, early known for his medical skills, found profound insights in the waters of the Yi River, exhausting the golden treasures. A lamp in a quiet room reveals profound truths, as the Yellow Emperor in the Inner Canon praises Qibo in awe. Days accumulate and are not easily sold, is half a lifetime merely to break an arm three times? The medicine I excel in has its own liveliness, yet old prescriptions are piled high like raw fish. I do not hear of Li Yan dwelling with the same illness; upon sweating together, clarity comes by morning. Thus, I know the ancients had one prescription for one syndrome, while later generations matched prescriptions to symptoms, a principle yet to be clarified. Those who discern this with public-mindedness are often criticized by ordinary folk. The teacher, regretting to sleep beneath the yellow earth, leaves his students relying on your brilliance. The mission of saving lives will be shared, and one&#39;s authority is not trivial. For years summoned by the Tian Ce Bureau, the humble grass and trees all thrive exuberantly. It is best to treasure the rich and vibrant leaves, lest Fan He alone monopolizes fame.<a id="trans-374p" href="#orig-374p" class="marker">[374p]</a></p></div>

She experienced dizziness that made it impossible to sit, but she could rest when lying down; focused treatment on the discharge led to an improvement in both the discharge and her dizziness.</p>
<p>A man, seventy-nine years old, experienced heavy dizziness and weakness in his hands and feet, continuous phlegm production, a weak and large pulse in his left hand, a slow and large pulse in his right hand which was weaker than the left, with no response upon heavy pressing, reduced appetite and mild thirst, and had bowel movements once every three to four days. Everyone administered wind-dispersing herbs, predicting he would surely die by late spring. I said this was a case of great deficiency and should be treated with a strong tonic. The crowd was angered and left. I recommended using ginseng, angelica, astragalus, peony, and white atractylodes, boiled into a concentrated broth, supplemented with thirty pills of a particular remedy. After a year and a half of such treatment, his vitality returned to that of a young man. During winter, the remedy was enhanced with a bit of dry ginger; for the rest of the seasons, the same method was followed. The remedy was made into fine powder by stir-frying with ginger juice, and further formed into pills by cooking with ginger juice to create a paste.<a id="trans-375p" href="#orig-375p" class="marker">[375p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: A woman suddenly experienced dizziness and was unable to move. Upon examining her pulse, it was found to be large and floating, indicating that she had phlegm-dampness exacerbated by heat. After administering Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction and one hundred rolling phlegm pills, she recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;The Medical Guidelines&quot; states: A child had been shaking his head for seven years and had been experiencing blood in his stools for three years, with no treatment effective. Reflecting on this, I determined that there was an abundance of liver blood and external wind-heat disturbing him. The liver belongs to wood; when wood is strong, it overcomes the earth, resulting in the spleen being affected, and both the spleen and lungs, as mother and child, are overcome by the liver, leading to blood seeping into the stools, hence the persistent bloody stools. I then prescribed a remedy that would drain the liver, dispel wind, and nourish the spleen. After just a few doses, he was cured. Within ten days, the bleeding stopped, and white pus was expelled, allowing him to stabilize. </p>
<p>The prescription included three taels of Fangfeng, five qian of Guo Lao root, honey-fried Huangqi, Qianghuo, and Bai Shao, each five qian, two and a half qian of powdered rhinoceros horn and licorice, and one qian each of snake skin, Gouteng fruit, and Ma Huang. These were ground into a powder, combined with date flesh to form pills the size of a walnut, to be taken with peppermint tea after meals, five to seventy pills per dose. After just two doses, the head shaking stopped, and the bloody stools subsequently healed.<a id="trans-376p" href="#orig-376p" class="marker">[376p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Scholar Zhang Juyin, a librarian and a bachelor, had a fondness for wine and was carefree, unconcerned with fame or profit. He suddenly developed a fever and headache, and the physicians from the Hanlin Academy treated him for ten days, but his condition worsened. The other scholars collectively decided to summon Sun. Upon his arrival, Sun examined his pulse and said: &quot;Others all claim this is due to a cold attack, hence this illness. However, Scholar Zhang is fond of wine and has much phlegm; this is caused by what he has consumed. The illness is not due to a cold, as the pulse in his right hand is rapid while the left hand is steady. This must be a headache caused by overindulgence in food and drink. He should take five to seven pills of dietary medicine.&quot; After half a day of waiting, a resolution was reached. Sun then administered the dietary medicine, and gradually, as he digested, his chest became more comfortable, and the headache lessened. After further doses of digestives, he found relief. Generally speaking, when a yang pathogen causes a headache, it would not fail to result in fever and confusion after ten days. Thus, it is clear that this is not a cold, but rather an ailment caused by food.<a id="trans-377p" href="#orig-377p" class="marker">[377p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>An elderly woman suffered from a persistent headache for many years. Upon examining her limbs, all her blood vessels were purple-black. She then used a three-edged needle to extract several cups of blood that resembled ink.

This aligns with the idea that severe blockage causes ailments, and persistent headaches can obstruct the body; the extraction of her blood was a result of this treatment.</p>
<p>A man, due to worries and fatigue, experienced dizziness, dim vision, tinnitus, a flushed face, dry mouth, fevers, and difficulty breathing, with sweat but no appetite. His six pulses were rapid and strong.

<p>According to the medical case of Xue Ji: The esteemed elder Liang Houzhai had shortness of breath with phlegm, dark and turbid urine, and heel pain.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Du Xian Meng had a shortness of breath and phlegm retention, and after taking a pungent remedy, he experienced excessive phlegm and a two-foot floating pulse that felt hollow upon pressing. I believed the kidneys could not gather the qi and return it to its source, and the excess of aromatic dryness was the main issue. I prescribed the Eight Flavor Pill, and he recovered in three doses. </p>
<p>Sun Du Xian had a robust physique but was mentally exhausted due to joy and anger. He had a bright complexion, was thirsty, and coughed up phlegm. At times, he experienced dizziness or heat rising from his abdomen. His left three pulses were strong and forceful, while the right three pulses were strong yet without power. I concluded that there was a deficiency in the three yin pathways of his legs, so I used a formula to tonify the center and enhance qi, adding wheat kernel and five flavors and modifying the Eight Flavor Pill, after which he recovered. Should a person display signs of aging, be intolerant to cold and heat, or be unable to withstand work, and fall ill with changing seasonal ailments, it is often due to insufficient blood and qi during youth, along with mental strain, or possibly a deficiency in essence and blood due to excessive indulgence in sexual activity, thus making it hard to ascertain the full symptom picture. This insufficient essence and qi can be restored by nourishing the source of transformation, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if one&#39;s diet and exertion are excessive, accompanied by inappropriate emotions leading to various symptoms, the previous methods of treatment should apply. If the six pathogenic factors invade and cause illness, it is often due to true qi being weak and external pathogens invading; thus, reinforcing the stomach qi is paramount. The stomach is the foundation of the five organs, hence the caution against lightly using yellow brew and Anemarrhena, as they may further damage the stomach qi. Generally, mixed conditions belonging to internal causes indicate that both the vital and pathogenic energies are lacking, so treatment should focus on tonifying rather than purging. Lastly, though typhoid falls under external causes, it is also necessary to differentiate between interior and exterior, as well as between deficiency and excess, for appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered from swelling in her head and neck, experiencing unbearable pain, fever, and thirst, with a preference for cold. She took internal herbal remedies to clear heat and applied cold poultices externally. Her complexion was dark and lacking luster, and she felt a lump in her chest. This indicated a deficiency of Yang Qi and an accumulation of phlegm and fire, which did not respond to warming tonics. I used five qian each of ginseng and astragalus, and two qian each of ginger and cinnamon. In one dose, the swelling immediately burst. Afterward, I administered powerful tonics, and she recovered. </p>
<p>For cases of sores and swelling with severe pain and thirst for cold drinks, the condition shows both excess pathogenic and vital Qi. It is advisable to use Qing Re Xiao Du San (Clear Heat and Eliminate Toxins Powder) and Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin (Immortal&#39;s Prescription for Reviving Life) as the primary treatment. If there is severe swelling and pain, with dry mouth and a desire for hot drinks, the condition indicates excess pathogenic Qi and deficiency of vital Qi. The use of Tuo Li Xiao Du San (Discharge the Interior and Eliminate Toxins Powder) and Shan Qi Si Bu San (Four Tonics of Ginseng and Astragalus) should be the focus. If there is generalized swelling and mild pain, with poor appetite and fatigue, it indicates deficiency of both pathogenic and vital Qi, and one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Ingredients Decoction) and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Tonifying the Middle and Boosting Qi Decoction) to strengthen the spleen and stomach. This will help dissolve unformed swellings, promote drainage of those that have formed, and cause ruptured ones to heal.</p>
<p>One patient suffered from a brain abscess for over ten days, with a swollen face and tightly closed eyes, and a head as hot as a stove. The pulse was rapid and full, and the person was restless and craved cold drinks. This condition resulted from damp-heat in the bladder. I prescribed two doses of Huang Lian Xiao Du Yin (Coptis Elimination of Toxins Decoction) and then administered two bowls of sophora flower wine, which led to immediate improvement. Upon applying pressure with my fingers, the swelling would return, indicating that pus had formed. I then made an incision at the neck, forehead, shoulder, and cheek to allow the pus to drain, after which the mouth and eyes could open again.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Swelling and pain in the head and face, unresponsive to cooling medicine, require bloodletting with acupuncture. Afterwards, using the original formula will surely be effective. One man, thirty years old, suffered from shoulder toxicity. After taking two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San, he took ten Xuan San without ginseng and cinnamon, adding Jin Yin Hua and Tian Hua Fen for four doses, and it ruptured. Due to anger, liver fire moved, causing wind-heat to obstruct upwards, leading to swollen and painful head and face. Drinking cold water and taking Jing Fang Bai Du San with added Qín, Lián, and mint for two doses proved ineffective; urgently, acupuncture was applied to the afflicted area, releasing dark blood about a cup. After one more dose, the condition greatly improved, and he took four more doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San and completely healed.</p>
<p>In April of the second year of Taihe, there was a widespread epidemic, initially causing chills and fever. Next, symptoms included extreme swelling of the head and eyes, making it impossible to open the eyes, with difficulties in breathing, sore throat, dry tongue, and parched mouth. Commonly said, &quot;A big head brings calamity; relatives are disconnected, and many fall ill.&quot; One person suffered from this for five to six days, treated with Chengqi combined with Lán Gēn to purge, which provided slight relief; the next day, the illness returned to the original state; further purging yielded some relief, but ultimately, he could not recover, gradually worsening to a critical state. Dongyuan stated: &quot;Above half the body, it is Heaven&#39;s Qi; below half, it is Earth&#39;s Qi.&quot; Thus, the evil heat invaded between the heart and lungs, attacking upwards, causing swelling. Purging the stomach of excess heat with Chengqi was punishment without error, yet its effectiveness was not recognized.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a swelling that was hard and did not produce pus, only some fluid seeping from the sore, causing severe pain. After taking two doses of the Xianfang Huoming Decoction, the pain stopped and pus formed. He was then treated with needles, followed by a detoxifying medicine, and he recovered. Generally, if the pus is clean and the treatment does not respond or cause pain, or if it is a hard, obstructed condition, it is not treated.</p>
<p>Another man was on the verge of having an abscess, experiencing slight pain and thirst, with a weak and large pulse at the wrist. This was a sign of yin deficiency with heat. He believed the fire toxicity originated from the heart and took cooling herbs to reduce the fire, but it became more intense. Seeking further treatment, he was given the Four Substances Decoction, with additions of Huangbo, Zhimu, Wuweizi, Maidong, and Huangqi, along with a modified version of the Eight Treasure Pill. His thirst subsided and the sore healed; he was further treated with detoxifying medicine combined with the previously mentioned pill and recovered. </p>
<p>The “Zhongzang Jing” states that the formation of sores like carbuncles is due to accumulated toxicity in the five organs and six bowels, not solely from blockages in the defensive and nutritive qi. There are specific places where this occurs, and they correlate with their respective organs. For instance, if it arises in the throat or tongue, it is heart toxicity; in the skin or hair, it is lung toxicity; in the muscles, it is spleen toxicity; in the bones or marrow, it is kidney toxicity; arising below relates to yin toxicity, and above relates to yang toxicity; external issues are related to the six bowels and internal issues to the five organs. Therefore, internally it is termed necrosis, externally it is called ulceration, above is termed symptomatic, and below is termed obstructive. Conditions that arise above manifest quickly, while those that arise below manifest slowly. Affections of the six bowels are easier to treat, whereas those of the five organs are more difficult. From this perspective, if sores appear in the brain, it indicates that the bladder and governor vessel are involved, with insufficient yin energy and excessive yang fire manifesting outward.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Bitter cold medicines, though they treat yin conditions, must carefully differentiate between the superficial and deep, the viable and the deficient, in accordance with the timing and appropriateness; one cannot simply use them throughout the treatment. However, swelling, redness, pain, and a rapid pulse reveal that damp heat is excessive in the bladder channel. Thus, we use Huang Lian Xiaodu San to detoxify and remove dampness. The swelling and hardness causing pain arise from stagnant qi and blood; therefore, we employ Xianfang Huo Ming Yin to disperse lumps, detoxify, and break up blood stasis. If the sore does not heal, it is likely due to the heat toxin lingering and the stagnation of qi and blood. A warm, sweet remedy should be used to nourish the yang qi and promote decay. Moreover, this condition originates in the governing vessel channel, arising from excessive yang fire. If one does not investigate the root cause and exclusively uses bitter cold medicines, the stomach qi will be harmed, leading to issues with decay and convergence. How can one avoid deterioration? Sore conditions are easily resolved, decay rapidly, and converge readily, all due to the robust qi and blood.<a id="trans-389p" href="#orig-389p" class="marker">[389p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, nearly seventy years old, was of an impatient nature and fond of wine. She had a brain abscess for five days, with a tight and rapid pulse. Urgently, a remedy was prepared using Da Huang (rhubarb) wine, mixed with finely chopped wine and stir-fried into a powder. This was additionally prepared with wine and ginseng, combined with ginger and boiled. After taking this for two doses, she could then lie down and, with sweating on the upper half of her body while sleeping, her illness was resolved. This reflects the idea of internal support. This treatment was based on her impatient disposition and fondness for wine, coupled with her pulse condition. The pulse was tight and rapid, which was due to her impatient nature and love for wine damaging her blood. Therefore, Da Huang was used to drain the heat from the wine, while ginseng was utilized to nourish her qi and blood.</p>
<p>Another woman experienced swelling and pain on the left side of her head, with pus draining from her left nostril. Her condition persisted for over a year, with occasional dizziness, as if sitting in a boat or vehicle. Xu Shuwei diagnosed this as liver deficiency with wind evil affecting her. He prescribed one tael of Chuanxiong, three qian of Danggui, and half a tael each of Qianghuo, Xuanfu flower, Xixin, Fangfeng, Manjingzi, Shigao, Gaoben, Jingjiesui, Banxia chut, Gan Di Huang, and Licorice. Each dose was one tael, and she was cured after one course. This case was recognized as liver deficiency with wind evil attack; thus, the treatment aimed to expel wind, clear heat, nourish blood, and eliminate phlegm, considering her dizziness and pain localized to the left. The classics state that all wind-related dizziness belongs to the liver wood. Additionally, the left side is governed by the liver and gallbladder, and it is mentioned that wind affects from above. There is also a saying that without phlegm, dizziness does not occur, and the liver stores blood. It is also said that wind is a yang evil. Therefore, the prescription targeting wind, heat, phlegm, and blood is logically fitting.<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a></p></div>

Various ulcer doctors examined him, waiting for the sore to ripen so they could lance it with a needle to drain the pus.

His complexion turned a lackluster yellow, his limbs felt cold, he sweated yet his body felt cool, and he experienced periodic vomiting. His pulse was extremely weak and thin, and slow. This was due to his advanced age, the harshness of winter, and the suffering caused by his illness—he had a bland diet that eliminated the rich humors, leaving only a frail and emaciated form. Additionally, anger exacerbated his spirit&#39;s decline, leading to this cold transformation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In treating illness, one must examine the underlying conditions. This refers to assessing the appropriateness of treatment based on the current situation. All pain, itching, sores, and ulcers are associated with heart fire, which is its usual state. However, when sores are severe and the body appears emaciated, with pain rising and cold descending, this is abnormal. Therefore, one should carefully consider the timing and appropriateness of treatment to correct this imbalance. Thus, it is said that the &quot;classics&quot; represent the constant, the &quot;laws&quot; are for application, and the &quot;physicians&quot; provide intent. Treatment should be adapted to what is suitable in order to achieve comprehensive effectiveness.</p>
<p>In this case of an elderly person enduring the cold of winter, it is appropriate to warm and tonify. A formula of five spices was used, adding Angelica Daphne (Dingfu) for a dispersive effect; why? Because their anger had been repressed, obstructing the flow of yang energy, leading to stagnation. Moreover, their pulse was extremely deep, thin, and slow, indicating qi stagnation. Thus, five spices were used to open the blockages and Dingfu was added to support yang energy; this would disperse the stagnation and restore yang, thus promoting healing. This also reflects the treatment according to the nature of their pulse.</p>
<p>Lady Ye, dressed in fine clothing, suffered from a brain abscess, presenting with dry mouth and thirsty tongue. Internally, she took cooling herbs and externally applied soothing treatments, appearing dark and lacking vitality. She experienced chest oppression, indicating a deficiency of yang energy combined with cold. They suspected a phlegm-heat condition, which did not respond to warming and tonifying treatments. I prescribed five qian of ginseng and astragalus, two qian each of ginger and cinnamon; in one dose, her swelling subsided dramatically. Further, she received restorative herbs and was cured.</p>
<p>Another individual was on the verge of developing pus, experiencing slight pain along with thirst, with a large but weak pulse; this reflects a condition of yin deficiency with active fire. They believed it was a heat toxicity of the heart, and their self-medication with cooling herbs intensified the issue. After further consultation, the treatment involved a combination of the Four Substance Decoction, adding Huangbo, Zhimu, Wuwei, Maidong, and Huangqi, along with adjustments from the Eight Flavor Pills. Their thirst was alleviated and the sores healed; additionally, resolving agents were used alongside the previous pills, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-393p" href="#orig-393p" class="marker">[393p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One person experienced pain in the head and neck, and although the severe swelling and pain increased significantly, accompanied by diarrhea, restlessness, and insomnia, with a diminished appetite and thought, the condition appeared dire. Upon examining the pulse, it indicated the presence of toxin. I prescribed two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction, which reduced the swelling and pain by half. Then, I administered Er Shen Wan and Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding Wu Wei, Mai Dong, and Suan Zao Ren in four doses, which led to a slight reduction of symptoms, improved appetite, and some sleep. Next, I prescribed Shen Ling Bai Zhu San for several doses, which further improved their appetite. Finally, after one month of taking Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, with the addition of Jin Yin Hua, Bai Zhi, and Jie Geng, the patient recovered completely.</p>
<p>The scholar Pan Guangfu, over forty years old, suffered from a brain abscess and swelling. His pulse was deep and calm. I indicated that this was a Yang condition with an underlying Yin pulse that could not rise, and it indeed turned out to be so. Although sores and abscesses relate to heart fire, it is particularly important to differentiate between the exterior and interior, and between deficiency and excess. If the vital energy is robust but there is substantial internal fire, then cold remedies might be effective. However, excessive cold could weaken the stomach and spleen, causing a transformation from Yang to Yin, potentially leading to either a closure without rupture or rupture that does not heal. This would result in a discordance between Yin and Yang, conflict between water and fire, leading to certain death.</p>
<p>Attendant Zhu Nangaow suffered from a temporal abscess, with swelling and pain in the throat, worse in the afternoon. This was indicative of blood deficiency and dryness of the liver and gallbladder channels. I treated him with Si Wu Tang, adding Yuan Shen, Chai Hu, Jie Geng, and roasted Licorice, which resulted in recovery. Additionally, due to labor, he developed febrile chills, thirst, and sweating. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, omitting Chai and Sheng, and adding Wu Wei, Mai Dong, and roasted Ginger, which led to his healing.<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a></p></div>

This was due to insufficient kidney water, excessive liver and gallbladder fire, and dry blood. He was treated with the Six-Flavor Pill in four doses, and the sores began to drain and healed. Later, due to inappropriate care, he experienced swelling, pain, fever, and thirst, with a pulse that was weak and large. This indicated damage to the spleen and stomach qi. He was treated with the Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi formula to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish the kidney and liver, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man suffered from swelling and pain accompanied by fever. He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, supplemented with Lianqiao (forsythia), Jin Yin Hua (honeysuckle), and Jie Geng (platycodon), in four doses, achieving resolution.</p>

He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Lianqiao, Jin Yin Hua, Tian Hua Fen (trichosanthes root), and Jie Geng in four doses, which resolved the swelling.

<p>A man with swelling and pain in his head and face during mid-winter presented with a taut and tight pulse. He was treated with a warming and channel-opening decoction, which induced sweating and resolved the symptoms.</p>
<p>Another man had swelling and pain with chills and heat, and a rapid floating pulse. The Jing Fang Bai Du Powder was administered in two doses, which completely resolved the surface symptoms. Additional dispersing and detoxifying powder was used to alleviate the condition, resulting in stability.</p>
<p>Yet another man had mature pus that would not drain, causing swelling and pain. He was needled to stop the condition, and a dispersing and detoxifying powder was given, leading to recovery.

After taking a dose of the Immortal Life-Reviving Decoction, he was relieved; then taking the Six Gentlemen Decoction, combined with Angelica, Platycodon, and Gleditsia Thorns, he resolved the issue and recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had clear pus that would not gather. He took the Tori Powder, along with Schisandra and Ophiopogon, which helped consolidate it.</p>
<p>An elderly man had swelling, pain, and fever, with clear pus causing thirst. His pulse was soft and thin, indicating a deficiency in both blood and qi, which needed to be supplemented. When he felt thirsty and feverish, he resorted to heat-clearing medications, which led to vomiting and reduced appetite. Upon requesting treatment again, he was given the Six Gentlemen Decoction for four doses, which stopped the vomiting and improved his intake. He continued with tonic herbs for over a month until he recovered. </p>
<p>In patients, the qi and blood of the organs fluctuate between deficiency and excess. Moreover, sometimes Yin symptoms resemble Yang, and Yang symptoms resemble Yin; therefore, one cannot categorically apply cooling agents just because of fever and thirst. One should usually treat the patient’s genuine qi deficiency and the pathogenic qi excess, prioritizing relief for obstructions while using detoxifying herbs as an adjunct. If the genuine qi is strong and the pathogenic qi weak, one may focus on detoxification with obstruction relief herbs as support. If the genuine qi is weak and the pathogenic qi strong, focusing solely on detoxifying will first harm stomach qi. It is better to start with the Immortal Life-Reviving Decoction and Tori Detoxification Powder or to apply moxibustion. Once the pathogenic qi retreats and the genuine qi is restored, one can adjust treatment accordingly.</p>
<p>In general, if the genuine qi is depleted, it leads to deficiency; if the pathogenic qi prevails, it results in excess. The genuine and the pathogenic cannot coexist; when one prevails, the other loses. The deficiency does not wait to be harmed; it becomes deficient on its own. For conditions like back or head swellings and pustules, especially when affecting the limbs, moxibustion must be used to draw out the accumulated toxins and relieve the stasis, and one must be cautious not to focus solely on detoxification. One should diagnose through pulse examination and discern accordingly to avoid errors.<a id="trans-397p" href="#orig-397p" class="marker">[397p]</a></p></div>

A modified Jing Fang Bai Du powder was prescribed, adding Qinjiao, Lianhua, and Da Huang; he improved slightly. Further treatment with four doses of Jing Fang Bai Du powder resulted in complete resolution.

<p>Dong Yuan stated that the onset of sores differentiates between external and internal causes, and treatment varies between cold and warmth. For external causes, warming agents should be used to clear the skin, while using cold medicines would draw the evil from the surface into the marrow. For internal causes, cold agents should be employed to promote elimination, and using warming agents would exacerbate bone marrow diseases that spread to the skin, leading to a combined sore, increasing toxicity and suffering significantly; it may lead to serious danger or even death.</p>

<p>The &quot;Classic of Surgery&quot; states: a man with a brain ulcer for over ten days showed severe lesions, connected to both ears, with swelling in the neck, redness and heat, a floating and rapid pulse.

Subsequently, it began to fester, producing pus, amounting to several liters by the month, enduring for half a month. Due to the previous medicine being ineffective, accompanied by inner restlessness, vexation in the five hearts, and gradually decreasing appetite, this was because the excessive pus and blood loss were symptoms of false heat due to deficiency, and a change was necessary. Therefore, a dose of Shengyu Decoction was given; when it did not take effect, another dose was given, adding two taels of prepared Aconite. This time it took effect, and all prior symptoms receded. Next, using Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction with added Mai Dong and Wu Wei, each being up to three taels, the patient was nurtured for over a month. Later, the necrosis of the cerebral bone led to pieces of flesh falling off, appearing disheveled and unseemly. Anyone who saw it could not help but nod in astonishment. There was concern that the necrosis was extensive and could not be replenished. Thus, every day in the congee, three taels of Ginseng were added to the meal to nourish the spleen essence.

<p>Another man suffered from thirst for three years and chills and fevers for half a month, believing himself to have malaria.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had swelling and pain for five or six days. He wished to resolve it internally and applied a cooling medicine externally while taking large doses of rhubarb to promote purging. After the swelling subsided, he developed chills, fever, nausea, and dry vomiting, with tension in his shoulders. Upon examination, his pulse was rapid and weak, indicating internal deficiency and toxic qi penetrating within, caused by an excess of cooling medicine. </p>
<p>According to Dong Yuan, the onset of sores and abscesses can be differentiated by internal and external causes, and treated with either cold or warm methods. For external causes, one should apply warming methods combined with internal tonification; using cold medicines for purging can damage the spleen and stomach, leading to internal deficiency and allowing external toxins to enter. For internal causes, one should use cooling methods to clear, but using warming medications can mistakenly drive toxins to the skin surface, leading to a combined sore, exacerbating the disease and increasing suffering. Mild cases may worsen, while severe cases can be fatal.</p>
<p>Since the previous condition was indeed due to excessive cooling medicine, two doses of Baizhong Decoction were given, and the vomiting completely stopped.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered from a hard swelling, cold and hot sensations, dry mouth, and painful heat, with a strong and forceful pulse, indicating a condition of solid interior and exterior. A dose of Fangfeng Tongsan was administered twice, and her symptoms slightly improved; with another dose taken several times, the heat subsided and thirst ceased. However, for the original sore and hard swelling, a silver needle was used to puncture it, and a piece of toad venom was inserted. An internal formula to clear toxic heat was gradually administered until the pus was expelled and she felt at ease.</p>
<p>A man suffered for three or four days; his crown was swollen but there were no exterior or interior symptoms. This was an issue of damp-heat in the liver channel.

Initially, some pus appeared at the top, and the swelling decreased.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jingyue Quanshu&quot; states: &quot;The late Duke Shoufeng, in his youth, enjoyed drinking a lot, which led to his drinking illness. After he turned forty, he stopped drinking altogether but, at the age of seventy, during New Year&#39;s Eve celebrations, he drank a small cup and subsequently felt dizzy and unable to rise in the morning. The Duke was adept at emesis, as recorded in the section on phlegm and drink. He induced vomiting to expel the clear phlegm, and the dizziness quickly resolved. The underlying issue was that one cup of wine, how could it suddenly cause phlegm? It was merely due to the foul nature of the alcohol, and being affected by the wine fumes disrupted the true yin and pure qi. By expelling the phlegm and drink, the influence of the wine could be negated. Vomiting can elevate qi and restore clear yang. This is not merely treating phlegm but fundamentally correcting the disorder, and that is the intended meaning shared here.&quot;<a id="trans-403p" href="#orig-403p" class="marker">[403p]</a></p></div>
