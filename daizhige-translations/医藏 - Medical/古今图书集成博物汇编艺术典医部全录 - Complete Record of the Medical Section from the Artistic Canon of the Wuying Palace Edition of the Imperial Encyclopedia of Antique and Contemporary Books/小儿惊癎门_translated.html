<p><strong>On Childhood Seizures</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic of Medicine)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Unusual Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: When a person is born with epilepsy, what is the name of this condition? How does one come by it? Qibo replied: It is called &quot;fetal disease.&quot; This occurs when the mother experiences a significant shock during pregnancy; her qi rises and does not descend, causing the essential energy to reside together, hence the child develops epilepsy. </p>
<p>[The illness of the female fetus results from a great shock, leading to an upward surge of qi that does not descend. Essential energy nourishes the fetus, but when this energy resides together, the mother&#39;s shock causes an upward movement of qi, thus the child&#39;s essential energy is also reversed, leading to the manifestation of seizures. It is my humble opinion that &quot;epilepsy&quot; should often be written as &quot;dizziness.&quot; It is noted that infantile epilepsy often arises from the mother experiencing shock during pregnancy. Hence, epilepsy is born from reversed qi, manifesting due to the upward reversal of qi.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Condition of Surprise Seizures</strong></p>
<p>It is said: The reason children experience surprise seizures (癎病) and cramps (痉病) is due to imbalances in the internal energies. If a newborn exhibits surprise seizures, it is because the five organs are not properly contained, the blood and energy are not gathering, the five organs are not functioning smoothly, and the bones are weak, often leading to incomplete growth. If seizures occur after the child is more than forty days old and continue until the first year, it is also due to improper nursing, disharmony in the blood and energy, or being affected by external wind pathogens. </p>
<p>Initially, if the child’s body feels hot, accompanied by sudden startles and crying, followed by pain, a floating pulse indicates a yang seizure, which affects the six bowels and the skin, and is relatively easy to treat. Conversely, if the body feels cold, with no startles or crying, and the pulse is deep when the condition manifests, it indicates a yin seizure, affecting the five organs and the inner bones, making it very difficult to treat. When the body softens and regains consciousness during an episode, it is called a seizure. If the body stiffens and arches like a bow, and does not regain consciousness, it is termed a cramp.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>In cases of severe convulsions, if an adult&#39;s back can accommodate a sideways hand, and a child&#39;s arm can fit three fingers, it is no longer treatable. The distinction between superficial and deep pulse reflects whether the illness lies in Yin or Yang. Superficial and deep pulses can further exhibit variations such as large, slippery, thin, firm, sluggish, or rapid, each requiring treatment based on the pulse&#39;s characteristics. The &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot; states that childhood convulsions have one hundred twenty types, with symptoms subtly differing from the norm; these are indicative of convulsions. When a child first emerges, their blood vessels are not yet consolidated, and their internal organs are not yet fully developed; if nurturing is not appropriately managed, illness will ensue. If unfortified, diseases may arise from changes and steaming. Other symptoms may be mild, but middle wind (stroke) is the most sudden and dangerous. If a child&#39;s limbs are prone to spasms and their breathing is slightly different, and they show signs of a convulsion and experience steaming with no resolution, Longdan decoction should be administered. There are three types of convulsions in children: wind convulsions, fright convulsions, and food-related convulsions.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When it comes to convulsions caused by wind, they occur from time to time; among ten children, there are rarely one or two who experience wind convulsions. Generally, those that occur following cold and then heat are due to food-related convulsions. For wind convulsions, one should apply moxibustion according to the diagram; for food convulsions, one should administer the appropriate treatment to recover, with the purple pill being excellent. The reason why children acquire wind convulsions is that they sweat from being too warmly dressed, and then the wind enters. A wind convulsion manifests first with the fingers curling as if counting; this indicates a wind condition. A surprise convulsion arises from fright or loud crying; this is known as a startled convulsion. For mild startled convulsions, one should hold the child firmly and avoid further frightening them, or it may resolve on its own. If it begins without breastfeeding, followed by vomiting and then heat leading to convulsions, this is a food-related convulsion. Treating promptly leads to recovery; the four-flavor purple pill and the expelling drink are most effective, quickly dispelling illness without exhausting the child. The red pill works quickly; for severe cases, it should be used.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The text does not have a specific formula for the red pill, and all the doctors&#39; prescriptions do not include it. If the four-flavored purple pill cannot be administered, then one should use the red pill. The red pill acts quickly, and it should be used for severe cases. The first prescription mentioned for post-illness distension is the eight-flavored, named the purple double pill, which uses vermilion color instead of red, along with croton seeds and euphorbia, suggesting it acts faster than the purple pill, and this might indeed be the red pill.</p>
<p>For infants who cannot breastfeed, they should be given the purple pill. When a child is newly born, their vitality is strong, so even slight discomfort requires treatment, and it should not cause harm. Once recovery begins, it will lead to substantial benefits. If treatment is not administered in a timely manner, it can lead to severe illness, which becomes difficult to treat. Among treatments, the four-flavored purple pill is the most effective; although it can be purgative, it does not harm the individual and is sufficient to alleviate sickness. If the four-flavored purple pill cannot be used, then one should resort to the red pill; if the red pill cannot be given, then the dosage should be doubled.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If there remains residual heat after treatment, one should prepare Longdan Decoction and take it in small doses, and also apply red ointment. For wind-induced seizures, one should address it with pig heart soup. For fright-induced seizures, one should apply moxibustion according to the prescribed method and also use the nourishing ointment, but it is important not to over-treat. Why? Because fright-induced seizures cause instability in the heart&#39;s qi; if treated too aggressively, it can create further deficiency within, worsening the condition. Those with severe fright-induced seizures are particularly difficult to treat. Therefore, when caring for children, one must be cautious about startling them, avoiding loud noises; when holding them, do so gently and calmly, preventing fright. Also, during thunderstorms, one should protect the child&#39;s ears and minimize disturbing sounds. In general, when nurturing children, some minor shocks are acceptable to promote blood circulation, but one should avoid severe shocks. Severe shocks should be treated with moxibustion on the fright meridian. Moxibustion performed within 50 to 60 days may worsen the fright. After 100 days of life, moxibustion on the fright meridian is beneficial.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If a child has a fever, refuses to nurse, cannot rest while sleeping, and is easily startled, this is the beginning of convulsions. Administer the purple pill, and they will recover. If not, give it again. If the child is startled lightly while asleep, do this once a month with the purple pill to reduce the excessive energy; the child will not suffer from convulsions. </p>
<p>After the beginning of summer, if the child becomes ill, treat them cautiously without excessive cauterization. Do not induce vomiting or diarrhea; instead, bathe them with heat-clearing decoctions and apply heat-clearing powders and red ointments. Also, apply an ointment to the navel, keep the child in a cool place, do not restrict their intake of water or gruels, and always provide fresh water for drinking. </p>
<p>If the child is dressed too lightly, their milk and food will not digest. If digestion is impaired, their stools will have a sour smell; this is a sign of a potential obstruction. In this case, use the purple pill to gradually alleviate the condition. Begin with a small dose, ensuring that their stools remain soft; avoid severe purging. Once the stools are softer and no longer have a sour smell, then stop the medication. Generally, children do not fear purging in winter, while it is difficult to recover from purging in summer.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If there is illness, it is essential to induce a bowel movement. After this, the lower abdomen should feel slightly distended. Therefore, breastfeeding should be regulated for several days and not taken lightly. Moreover, when nursing a child, the amount should be consistent; as the child grows, it can be gradually increased. If it is decreased, there is likely a minor imbalance in the abdomen; one should take a small amount of medicine and refrain from breastfeeding. Instead, provide milk exclusively; in severe cases, for about ten days, and in milder cases, for five or six days, then breastfeeding can resume as usual. If the child refuses all food and only desires milk, this indicates a more serious condition that requires intervention. It is critical to induce a bowel movement; failure to do so may lead to cold, fever, vomiting, spasms, or even diarrhea. These complications arise from delaying treatment of a serious condition, which can be more difficult to treat later. However, if we address lighter symptoms first, the child will not suffer as much and will recover more quickly. In general, if a child&#39;s stool is yellow and foul-smelling, it suggests hidden heat in the abdomen, warranting a mild treatment with Longdan Decoction.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If the surface is white and sour, it indicates residual food that has not been digested; one should take the purple pill. For mild cases, administer a little medicine mixed internally to aid digestion; for severe cases, slightly increase the medicine to induce a gentle purge, while ensuring the child is nursed in moderation for several days to restore the stomach&#39;s balance. If nursing is not restricted, the illness is likely to recur, and if purged again, it will harm the stomach&#39;s qi, leading to abdominal bloating. It is acceptable to purge two or three times, but exceeding that will cause harm. </p>
<p>For children with a buildup, if the pulse is strong, it often leads to convulsions; this is due to food-induced convulsions, and purging will bring recovery. One must carefully observe the pulse in the palm and the three fingers, and should not delay purging, as it may provoke convulsions which are hard to treat. If purged early, the pulse will not rise again. If the pulse is still in the palm, it can be treated early; but if it reaches the fingers, the illness worsens. </p>
<p>In general, if a child has disease in the abdomen, they will experience cold and heat, leading to disturbances in the blood and pulse. When the pulse is disturbed, the heart becomes unsettled, leading to increased susceptibility to fright, and fright can hasten the onset of convulsions.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>The Method for Diagnosing Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy is a grave illness in children. Some may suffer without seeking medical help, yet the energy rises from within, and there must first be indications. One should carefully observe the child&#39;s spirit and take note of the symptoms. </p>
<p>If the pulse at the base of the hand is white and the flesh is black, this is a sign of epilepsy; if the flesh is red, it indicates heat. A dark blue and large pulse signifies cold, while a thin blue pulse indicates a normal state. </p>
<p>Dryness of the nose and mouth, along with difficulty in urination and defecation, suggests epilepsy. If the eyes lack clarity and the child looks upwards with a preference for sunlight, this signifies epilepsy. </p>
<p>A prominent blue vein behind the ear and an inability to lie still indicate epilepsy. A blue pulse, when pricked, causes blood to flow. </p>
<p>If a child exhibits reversed hair growth, weeps and laughs with a darkened face, and shows no change in complexion, these are signs of epilepsy. A blue nose and mouth, along with occasional fright, indicate epilepsy. </p>
<p>Closed eyes with a blue tint and moments of fright signal epilepsy. If the body is hot and the head sweats profusely, these are also signs of epilepsy. A hot body accompanied by vomiting and wheezing indicates epilepsy. A hot body with moments of direct gaze signifies epilepsy. </p>
<p>If the child shows a tendency toyawn and gazes upwards, this indicates epilepsy.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>High body temperature and poor vision indicate a convulsive condition. Enlarged pupils that are darker than usual also indicate this condition. Restlessness while lying down and trembling of the hands and feet are symptoms. Laughing in dreams and moving hands and feet indicate the same condition. Sudden anger with a sinking spirit is a sign. Difficulty in swallowing milk also points to this condition. Having a high body temperature with difficulty in urination indicates a convulsive state. Continuous vomiting and diarrhea, with intermittent pain, are further signs. Playing with the tongue and shaking the head are also indicative. The above symptoms, more than twenty in total, all point to the early stages of convulsions. When these signs appear, one should promptly apply moxibustion to the corresponding yang meridian. Apply pressure firmly, which may cause the child to cry suddenly, and when the pulse in the feet is absent, treat according to the prescribed formula and decoction. If the pupil is moving directly, accompanied by abdominal fullness, blood in the stool, high body temperature, inability to swallow milk, arching of the back, excessive sweating and fever, unresponsiveness while lying down, and jerking of hands and feet with exhilaration or fright, these eight signs indicate extreme convulsions. Should these occur, they cannot be salvaged with decoctions and pressure; immediate moxibustion is necessary. </p>

<h3>Treatment of Acute Convulsions in Children</h3>
<p>Acute convulsions in children can occur due to loud noises or fright, resulting in spasms that may subside. This condition arises from heat in the heart, indicated by a heated body and a flushed face, thirst, hot breath, and yellowish urine. In severe cases, convulsions may ensue, as excessive heat generates wind, overwhelming Yang and depleting Yin. It is advisable to use the Li Jing Wan to eradicate phlegm and heat, but avoid using medicine containing Dadou.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: According to the &quot;Bao Ying Ji,&quot; symptoms of acute convulsions include tight jaws, high fever, excessive drooling, unusual eye movements, spasms, hot breath, red cheeks, and rapid, strong pulse. This is due to blood deficiency in the liver, where fire moves to generate wind. When wind arises, Yin and blood dissipate, causing Yin fire to escalate; as fire moves, the lung’s metal is depleted, and the liver’s wood becomes excessive. It is beneficial to nourish liver blood and strengthen spleen Qi. If one frequently takes remedies to dispel wind, transform phlegm, and drain fire, it indicates spleen deficiency and blood loss, requiring immediate replenishment of spleen earth. If wind and fire clash, leading to fever and convulsions, eye twitching, and muscular spasms with abundant phlegm, use Si Wu and Diao Teng Gou to nourish liver blood and clear liver fire, along with Si Jun Zi plus Dang Gui to replenish spleen earth and strengthen lung metal. If liver blood is dry and overheated, causing convulsions, eyelid twitching, and abundant phlegm, use Liu Wei Wan to nourish kidney water and Si Jun Zi to supplement spleen earth. </p>
<p>If the lung metal overcomes liver wood, use Liu Jun Zi Tang to strengthen spleen earth, adding Bai Shao and Mu Xiang to balance lung metal. If one has frequently taken convulsion medicines and exhibits deficiency and coldness in spleen and stomach, it is necessary to use Liu Jun Zi Tang to bolster the spleen and stomach, with Ding Xiang and Mu Xiang to support Yang Qi; otherwise, the condition may develop into chronic seizures.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Chronic Shock in Children</strong></p>
<p>Chronic shock in children occurs after illness or from vomiting and diarrhea, or due to the harm caused by medications, leading to cold limbs, weak breath from the mouth and nose, twitching in the hands and feet, and a drowsy state with exposed eyes. This is a condition of deficiency in the spleen, producing wind without yang, and should be treated with Wenyuan Pills. </p>
<p>[Note: According to the &quot;Baoying Ji,&quot; when acute shock frequently recurs and leads to chronic shock due to spleen damage and the depletion of yin, one should replenish the spleen and nourish the blood, assisted by calming and clearing the lungs with proper herbal combinations. I believe that the underlying cause is often due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, where the liver wood overcomes it. Therefore, it is effective to use a variation of Wuwei Yigong Powder supplemented with Angelica and paired with a herbal decoction to replenish the spleen and balance the liver. If this does not work, one should use Liu Jun Decoction with roasted ginger and cardamom to warm and support the spleen; if this also fails, one must urgently add Aconite to restore yang. Using herbs to expel wind and drive out phlegm may dangerously worsen the condition. It is frequently observed that children with weak spleen and stomach conditions develop chronic shock immediately after an illness; one should not mistakenly attribute this to prolonged illness or improper medication leading to chronic conditions. The &quot;Neijing&quot; describes chronic splenic wind, indicating that the spleen is vulnerable to disease, which is evident.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Convulsions caused by fright manifest differently in males and females: males will gaze silently to the left and make sounds while looking to the right, while females will be silent when looking to the right and vocal when looking to the left, as they are opposing each other. Hence, there are signs related to the convulsive episodes. </p>
<p>Note: Most cases arise from issues during the fetal stage, from a nursing mother’s anger affecting the child, or from the child’s own ailments affecting nursing. The signs include vomiting milk and a pale face; if there is phlegm accumulation, the face will be red with heat. It is important to also treat the mother carefully to avoid depleting her vital energy. To determine if the condition is reversed or normal, for males, a fist with the thumb inside the index finger indicates normal; outward indicates reversed. For females, placing the thumb inside the index indicates reversed; outward indicates normal. Additionally, nursing should not resemble treatment for the mother. Follow this procedure accordingly.</p>
<p>If, during the Yin and Yang hours (around early morning), the body exhibits extreme heat, the eyes gaze upwards, the limbs tremble, and there is hot saliva, this indicates a strong liver. At this point, reinforce the kidneys and treat the liver using Di Huang Wan (Rehmannia Pill) and Xie Qing Wan (Clear Green Pill) as the main remedy.</p>
<p>Note: If the patient feels thirsty due to irritation and drinks cold water leading to constipation, Xie Qing Wan is appropriate. If there is fever but they drink warm water and do not experience constipation, Chai Shao Shen Ling San (Bupleurum, Peony, Ginseng, and Poria Powder) should be used. If there is sweating or night sweats due to kidney deficiency causing fluids not to return to their source, Di Huang Wan is the remedy. If strong medicines have been taken or if there is long-term salivation, leading to spleen deficiency causing fluids not to return, Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentleman Decoction) should be employed. The term “strong liver” refers to a deficiency in the liver wood while the pathogenic Qi is excessive; therefore, one should first nourish the mother and then reduce the excess from the child.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>If there are convulsions at the hours of Si (10 AM to 12 PM), Wu (12 PM to 2 PM), or Wei (2 PM to 4 PM), and the heart is alarmed with agitation, the eyes are red, the jaw is tightly closed, saliva is flowing from the mouth, and the limbs shake, this indicates an excess of heart energy. One should use Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver, Dao Chi San, and Liang Jing Wan to treat the heart. </p>
<p>(Note: It is noted that the previous symptoms are due to an excess of pathogenic qi and a deficiency of true qi, hence the use of Di Huang Wan. If the excessive salivation does not stop, it indicates deficiency of heart fire and weakness of the spleen, and should be supplemented with Liu Jun Zi Tang.)</p>
<p>If there are slight convulsions and panting at the hours of Shen (3 PM to 5 PM), You (5 PM to 7 PM), or Xu (7 PM to 9 PM), with the eyes slightly squinting, the body feeling hot, and the eyes open during sleep, while the hands and feet feel cold, and the stool is light yellow, this indicates excess lung energy. One should use Yi Huang San to nourish the spleen, Dao Chi San to treat the heart, and Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>According to the note, the previous condition indicates true cold from the spleen&#39;s soil, which cannot generate lung qi and instead mimics heat. Therefore, it is advisable to use Yihuang San to nourish the mother of lung metal, especially with the addition of Liu Jun Zi and roasted ginger for better effect. If the hands and feet are not cold, indicating weakness, Wuwei Yigong San with added Mu Xiang should be used. For the formulas Daoshi San and Xie Qing Wan, they should be used with caution if the original qi is not yet depleted. However, if there is a long-standing illness with depleted original qi, it is essential to use Liu Jun Zi Tang, focusing on calming the spirit, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to address this.</p>
<p>If during the periods of Hai, Zi, or Chou, one experiences slight spasms, body heat, eyes straining and tilted, phlegm in the throat, and white stools with excessive sleepiness, Yihuang San should be used to nourish the spleen. Additionally, Daoshi San and Liang Jing Wan can be used to treat the heart.</p>
<p>According to the note, the previous condition indicates a deficiency and coldness of the body. It is advisable to use Liu Jun Zi with roasted ginger to warm and nourish the spleen. The Qing Xin An Shen Wan and Liu Wei Wan can be used to balance and nourish heart blood. Mr. Jie Gu Zhang mentions that these conditions arise due to the depletion of the spleen and stomach after a major illness, which is quite clear.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>If it were not for the treatment of the Six Gentlemen Decoction to strengthen the foundation, the condition of slow spleen wind would surely change. If harm from wind leads to convulsions, with heat in the mouth, yawning and restlessness, and trembling of the hands and feet, one should use Da Qing Gao to disperse it.</p>
<p>According to the notes, if the wind injury causes convulsions, one must distinguish whether there is sweating or not, using Da Qing Gao and Xiao Xu Ming Decoction. If the heat in the mouth is strong and the convulsions are vigorous, it indicates a condition that is solid and should use Da Qing Gao to disperse the wind evil. If the mouth is not hot and the convulsions are weak, it indicates a deficiency, and one should use Yi Gong San to tonify the spleen and Liu Wei Wan to nourish the kidney water, and Diao Teng Yin to clear the liver heat. If wind evil and accumulated heat manifest various symptoms, one should treat the lung meridian and clear the wind evil. If the external evil has been eliminated but the symptoms do not improve, one should strengthen the spleen and tonify the lung. If one only treats the lung directly, it risks harming the spleen qi, and various symptoms will arise.</p>
<p>If convulsions occur after eating, accompanied by a warm body and excessive sleep, or if there is vomiting and loss of appetite, one should first stabilize the convulsions. To stop the convulsions, administer Bai Bing Zi, followed by An Shen Wan as the main treatment.</p>
<p>According to the notes, if there is stagnation from food, vomiting with loss of appetite, abdominal distension, and constipation, it indicates solid heat, and Bai Bing Zi should be used. If the convulsions worsen after treatment and there is still vomiting with loss of appetite, it indicates deficient heat, so Yi Gong San should be used to replenish it. If the spleen and stomach are already harmed and the liver wood prevails, then Liu Jun Jia Diao Teng Gou should be used to strengthen the spleen qi and balance the liver wood. Generally, if the condition does not improve after consuming foods, simply adjusting and tonifying the stomach will cause all evils to retreat.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Within a hundred days, convulsions may occur. In true cases, there are only two or three episodes, and the person is certain to die; in false cases, the convulsions happen frequently without death. The true condition comes from internal fright and epilepsy, while the false condition arises from external cold and wind. If the blood and qi are not sufficient, they cannot endure, hence the convulsions occur. With heat in the mouth, one should apply common blue ointment to the crown and use bathing or other methods.</p>
<p>(Note: Many antecedent cases are caused by in utero afflictions, or by the mother’s suppressed anger being transmitted to the child, or by the child&#39;s own spleen being damaged. One should primarily focus on restoring the original qi while also addressing the mother’s condition. The child’s nursing cannot be treated similarly. Henceforth, follow this method.)</p>
<p>When a child is newly born, with strong heat and vomiting, the body becomes rigid, hands and feet convulse, and eyes glance up and stare straight. This is referred to as the condition of wind seizure originating from the fetus.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>[Note: Many instances of these conditions arise from pregnant women experiencing anger, fear, or shock, which disrupts their normal balance, or from external disturbances harming the fetus internally. When the mother is affected, the fetus will certainly feel it. One should use pig&#39;s milk cream to wipe the child&#39;s mouth; alternatively, one can use &quot;Xingxing San&quot; combined with &quot;Luo Lu,&quot; allowing the mother to decoct and ingest it, ensuring the medicine enters the milk, and the child will recover on their own.]</p>
<p>For cases of startling cries, where evil qi occupies the heart, one should use &quot;An Shen Wan&quot; (Calm Spirit Pill) as the remedy. Dou Hanqing&#39;s &quot;Complete Book on Sores and Ulcers&quot; states: When startling and crying are accompanied by tears, it indicates abdominal pain, and &quot;Su He Xiang Wan&quot; (Compound Musk Pill) is effective when taken with wine.</p>
<p>[Note: Crying without loud wails but with many tears indicates fright and anxiety; wailing without tears suggests pain. For insufficient heart blood, use &quot;Mi Zhi An Shen Wan&quot; (Secret Formula Calm Spirit Pill); for excessive heart fire, use &quot;Dao Chi San&quot; (Guide Out Red Powder); for water and fire conflicting, use &quot;Chai Hu Zhi Zi San&quot; (Bupleurum and Gardenia Powder); for insufficient liver blood, use &quot;Liu Wei Wan&quot; (Six-Flavor Pill). The reference to ten types of wails implies similar variations among them.] </p>
<p>Diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>In treating the five types of epilepsy, one must follow the ailments of the organs. Each organ corresponds to an animal shape, and the use of five-colored pills is for treating minor illnesses. If the condition worsens, it can be fatal, as can severe illnesses. If a patient arches their back and makes a sound like a dog, it indicates liver involvement. If their eyes bulge and they stick out their tongue with a sound like a sheep, it indicates heart involvement. If they have a straight gaze and abdominal pain with a sound like a cow, it indicates spleen involvement. If they jump and extend their hands while making a sound like a chicken, it indicates lung involvement. If the limbs are stiff like a corpse and they foam at the mouth while making a sound like a pig, it indicates kidney involvement.</p>
<p>Commentary: According to traditional beliefs, if a pregnant woman experiences shock or fear, there will be an internal effect on the fetus. The first month affects the Liver, the second month affects the Gallbladder, the third affects the Heart, the fourth month is termed &quot;leaving the path,&quot; the fifth affects the Spleen, the sixth affects the Stomach, the seventh affects the Lungs, the eighth affects the Large Intestine, and the ninth affects the Kidneys. The organs gather energy in the lower abdomen, nourishing from the Liver to the Kidneys through the ten channels. This results from conditions affecting the fetus. After birth, various factors can cause issues such as shocks, irregular milk feeding, or imbalances in the diet and lifestyle of the nursing mother. It&#39;s crucial to determine which channel is affected and to differentiate between Yin and Yang, deficiency and excess, cold and heat, and urgent and mild conditions, primarily to regulate and support the Spleen and Stomach; otherwise, timely intervention may not happen, potentially leading to dire consequences.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Six Diseases in Hejian by Liu Wanshu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infantile Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>When an infant experiences convulsions, their hands and feet may twitch and contract. In such cases, one can use diagnostic methods and formulas to expel the illness. Symptoms include high fever accompanied by aversion to cold, shivering, and confusion, which are all indicative of heat-related conditions associated with the Heart&#39;s Yin deficiency. If the infant displays rigidity, weakness in limbs, restlessness, and muscle spasms, these are related to wind disorders characterized by the Liver&#39;s Yang. </p>
<p>Infants are considered to be children up to the age of six and youths from eighteen onwards. Those under six have no established treatments in the classics. Thus, infants often suffer from ailments that are hard to treat and cannot be definitively diagnosed. Nevertheless, the treatments for children and adults differ significantly. </p>
<p>After birth, infants have fragile bones and soft flesh, and their digestive systems are delicate. They rely on milk and food to nourish their organs, which provides safety and tranquility. However, if they develop stagnation and internal heat affecting the heart, this can lead to convulsions. Continuous convulsions can result in illness. Generally, children are predominantly Yang, possessing more heat than cold. </p>
<p>Infantile convulsions stem from excessive heart fire, which impairs the Metal element, disrupting the Wood element, causing a clash between wind and fire, leading to symptoms such as confusion and convulsions. These signs are indicative of severe heat giving rise to wind.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng)</strong><br><strong>Startling Wind</strong></p>
<p>It is often said that children experience convulsions caused by wind and heat, which is a common ailment. During convulsions, one must strictly avoid grabbing their hands and feet too forcefully, as this can lead to paralysis on one side. If the energy and blood are excessively strong, it may cause numbness in one arm, gradually leading to frailty that becomes difficult to treat in old age. When convulsions occur, place a bamboo mat on the cool ground for the child to lie on, allowing the convulsive energy to circulate through the meridians and stop naturally without causing harm.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Chill and Contraction</strong></p>
<p>Children aged three to five, or those seven to eight, up to more than ten years old, may have fits with frothy salivation, losing consciousness, their eyes wide and breathing rapidly, as though they are on the verge of death. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; these episodes stem from the fear and fright acquired while in the womb, leading to mild shock in some and severe epilepsy and convulsions, along with internal heat accumulation and umbilical wind in others. For the above symptoms, one may use treatments to expel the saliva and medicinal remedies to induce vomiting. Once the vomiting is complete, it is advisable to use cooling medicine such as ruby rhinoceros horn, musk, and other remedies to calm the saliva. If the child is still nursing, the mother should also take medicine to soothe the spirit and stabilize the mind, such as calming pills. If a woman becomes pregnant and experiences fright, worry, or grief, even if she bears a child, it is certain that there will be various ailments.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences internal diarrhea, it may transition into slow shock. If the child stares straight ahead and breathes through a fish-like mouth, it is not advisable to administer purgatives. Instead, it is suitable to focus on nurturing and warming to harmonize.</p>
<p><strong>Acute and Chronic Shock</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, there was no specific differentiation between acute and chronic shock in children, but it was referred to as &quot;Yin-Yang Convulsion.&quot; The terms acute and chronic shock were later coined, similar to the classification of red and white dysentery. Acute shock is associated with Yang energy, which is swift in motion; thus, it is termed acute. In contrast, chronic shock pertains to Yin energy, which is calm and slow, hence its designation as chronic. This distinction highlights the differences in Yin and Yang, deficiency and fullness, cold and heat, and must not be neglected in treatment.</p>
<p>Acute shock stems from heat, which generates wind. It may also arise from fright, manifesting as drooling from the eyes, spasms in the body, and warm breath. Once the onset stabilizes, or when the child awakens, they may return to normal. This indicates acute shock. </p>
<p>As the spasms diminish, one should apply calming medicine to address the heat. After stabilizing the shock, swift action to dispel phlegm-heat and restore the mind to tranquility is crucial for recovery. </p>
<p>Chronic shock often follows a major illness, after vomiting and diarrhea, or due to exhaustion, leading to weakness in the spleen and stomach. Wind evades the body, manifesting as spasms that are not severe. This condition is known as &quot;Epilepsy,&quot; often appearing as lethargy with an unresponsive demeanor, coolness in the limbs and breath. The child may keep their eyes partially open during sleep or cry in pain similar to a crow&#39;s voice, indicating a serious condition likely due to weakness of the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treating Children’s Frights</strong> </p>
<p>External disturbances should be calmed with Huanglian Anshen Pills. If fright is caused by Qi movement, use Hanshuishi Anshen Pills. One must avoid using Fangfeng Pills for wind; warming and spicy medications can certainly be fatal. Why is this? Warming and dispersing herbs are yang; heat is fire, which can harm the mother (Earth) and support the excessive Qi of the child (Wood), leading to death. If fright leads to a bluish color and diarrhea, one should first calm the liver with substances like vermillion. Do not use cold or cooling substances; avoid using cold fright pills. If wind and Wood are strong, they will counter the spleen and stomach, so it is necessary to first bolster the Earth, and then drain the Wood. Yan Xiaozhong compiled the Qian family&#39;s formulas to benefit the yellow and replenish the Earth. These remedies contain clove, which is spicy and warming, enhancing fire, thus causing the Earth to become even more deficient. The green tangerine peel drains the Lung and Metal; clove, being spicy and warming, severely drains the Lung and Large Intestine. When the spleen is plentiful, one can drain the child; but if the spleen and stomach are deficient, to further drain the child and increase fire is to severely weaken the Earth, which without a doubt leads to death. In cases of strong wind and Wood, the right pulse is rapid and strong, the palms are hot, and the belly skin is warm—how can one assist fire to drain Metal? If cold water invades the spleen and Earth, the symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, and bluish-white diarrhea, for which Yihuang San is the sacred remedy. Now we prepare Huangqi Decoction, to first drain fire and replenish Metal, greatly strengthening the Earth, which is the method for divine healing.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Ping Zhi Hui Cui</strong> [Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p><strong>Sudden and Chronic Inward Wind</strong></p>
<p>For feverish mouth sores, palms feeling hot, phlegm heat, phlegm wheezing, and phlegm cough: use purging methods. If severe, use Gua Di San; if mild, use Ku Shen and Chi Xiao Dou powder, mixed with sour juice to induce vomiting; then take Tong Sheng San honey pills. </p>
<p>There are two types of shock: one due to phlegm heat, which is acute shock and should be purged directly; the other due to spleen deficiency, which is chronic shock and often leads to death, requiring nourishment of the spleen. Dongyuan states that for chronic shock one must first strengthen the spleen’s soil, then disperse wind pathogens. </p>
<p>For acute cases, just focus on lowering fire, reducing phlegm, and nourishing blood. For chronic cases, simply use Zhu Sha An Shen Wan, and search for solutions in blood tonics.</p>
<p><strong>Pediatric Comprehensive Manual</strong> [Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng]</p>
<p><strong>Inward Wind</strong></p>
<p>Shock is shock, wind is wind; it is crucial to differentiate clearly and not mix treatments. Shock occurs from seeing abnormal forms or strange objects, disputes, falls, or encounters with water, fire, or beasts, leading to startled spirits and qi stagnation that produces phlegm. Phlegm obstructs qi, causing spasms, crooked mouth and eyes, and drooling. One may suddenly return to normal as if nothing happened. It can recur daily or several times a day, or every few days, month, or half-year. If not treated urgently, it may transform into a chronic seizure disorder, becoming a lifelong ailment. Treatment should first focus on expelling phlegm and unblocking qi, followed by clearing the heart and calming the spirit.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The wind affliction can arise from external exposure to wind and cold, or from internal injuries due to improper diet, leading to internal heat. This heat generates phlegm, which in turn causes convulsions. The signs include a crooked mouth and eyes, convulsions of the hands and feet, wheezing, excessive salivation, foaming at the mouth, transient awakening, persistent tidal fever, and relapse shortly after. The treatment should first drain heat and resolve phlegm, and then use methods to clear heat and calm the spirits.</p>
<p>There are two types of convulsions: acute and chronic. Acute convulsions are due to excess and heat, and should be treated with cooling methods; chronic convulsions are due to deficiency and cold, and should be treated with warming and tonifying methods. They should not be treated the same way, as this could lead to adverse results. Acute convulsions in children occur when their vital energy is typically strong, potentially triggered by fear, exposure to wind and cold, or improper diet. Careful examination is required to diagnose accurately before applying treatment. </p>
<p>If the convulsions were previously triggered by fear, the symptoms should return to normal once there are no other illnesses present. Initially, use a phlegm-dissolving pill to ease the flow of qi and resolve phlegm, and then use a calming pill to adjust the condition.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If the wind arises from wind and cold, its symptoms will manifest as a brief awakening, soon followed by a relapse. In mild cases, a single dose of Da Chi San will stop the wind, followed by Liang Jing Wan and Bao Long Wan to regulate. In severe cases, phlegm and fluid accumulation occur; first, take Da Chi San with Wu Se Wan to reduce fire and expel phlegm. Next, take Da Chi San with Xie Qing Wan to clear the heart and liver fire; finally, use Bao Long Wan to address phlegm and Bao Ming Dan to treat the wind, gradually adjusting as needed.</p>
<p>If the wind arises from previous dietary injuries, symptoms will manifest as a brief awakening, often leading to crying, followed by relapse with a lack of desire for milk or food. First, use the decoction of Chen Pi and Mai Ya and take Wu Se Wan to eliminate food, causing phlegm to descend on its own; then treat with Chen Sha Wu Ling San. </p>
<p>In all treatments for sudden fright, except for dietary injury cases, one must not hastily use purgatives.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>First, one must ask about the condition of urination and defecation. If the urine is clear and the stool is regular, the邪 (pathogenic factor) is on the surface; one can use导赤散 (Daohong San) with防风 (Fangfeng) to treat it or use 泻青丸 (Xieqing Wan) with less rhubarb and add 全蝎 (Quanxie) to make a soup to resolve the cold邪 on the surface, allowing the wind to recede. Then, adjust with辰砂五苓散 (Chen-zhusha Wuling San); avoid musk, for it may draw邪 inside.</p>
<p>If the urine is red and thin, and the stool is hard and constipated, this邪 is internal, and五色丸 (Wuse Wan) can be used to purge it, followed by 牛黄清心丸 (Niuhuang Qingxin Wan) and抱龙保命丹 (Baolong Baoming Dan) adjusted to treat it.</p>
<p>For urgent cases of shock with wheezing and phlegm, 定喘汤 (Dingchuan Tang) with bamboo juice is appropriate. For urgent cases of wind phlegm causing obstruction and a lack of release, one may use emetic methods.</p>
<p>For sickness with a returning fever after the initial fever has subsided, this indicates deficiency-heat of the spleen; treat with 四君子汤 (Si Junzi Tang) with roasted dry ginger. If urine is red, stool hard, the cheeks swollen, and the legs warm, this indicates residual邪; do not treat as deficiency. Use 凉惊丸 (Liangjing Wan) along with牛黄清心丸, combined with薄荷灯心汤 (Bohe Dengxin Tang) for adjustment.</p>
<p>If heat has subsided but there remains unconsciousness and inability to awaken, this indicates residual邪 affecting both the heart and spleen channels; treat with 安神丸 (Anshen Wan) combined with 鬼神丹 (Guishen Dan).<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>For any child with a slight fever, when observing their cheeks as red and their eyes looking upward, they are likely to have a convulsion. One should first use a cooling powder with lampwick and mint to reduce the heat, and then give Baolong pills to calm the spirit, which will prevent the onset of convulsions.</p>
<p>During a convulsion, if the hands are scattered, the eyes are closed, the mouth is gaping, there is a fish-like gasp, drooling, incoherence, not speaking or crying, and a complete refusal of food and drink, with involuntary urination and defecation, and a red face as if painted, none can be treated at that moment.</p>
<p>For children with lingering convulsions, their constitution may be weak, often with multiple illnesses. They may have severe vomiting and diarrhea, chronic malaria or dysentery, or have had adverse reactions to medications that induce vomiting or diarrhea, all leading to a weakening of the spirit, gradually resulting in spasms, with a recovery rate of only one in ten. This is due to the weakness of the vital energy, further exacerbated by fear.</p>
<p>The symptoms appear normal once passed, but there may be excessive crying, restlessness during sleep. One should not recklessly use phlegm-dissolving medications. First use Qingzhou white pills combined with Qinglong stone to eliminate phlegm, and then administer calming pills with Si Junzi Decoction to regulate accordingly. If after severe vomiting or diarrhea the hands and feet turn cold, and the child sleeps deeply with eyes partially open but no spasms, this indicates the potential onset of chronic convulsions. One should urgently warm and nourish, using Si Junzi Decoction with pan roasted sour jujube seed, dry ginger, and large dates as guides, boiled in water and administered frequently, regulating based on the warmth in hands and feet. In severe cases, add a slice of cooked Aconite. After recovery, use Jisheng pills to adjust.</p>
<p>In treating chronic convulsions, one must avoid recklessly using spicy or aromatic medicines, as they can drive away the vital energy, and cold medications can harm the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea followed by coldness in the hands and feet, persistent vomiting and diarrhea, sores in the mouth and tongue, closed eyes lacking consciousness, the mouth gaping without closure, head shaking with rigidity, sweating profusely, lethargy with urgent breathing, phlegm in the throat, crying like a crow, incontinence of bowel and bladder, bulging eyes, bowing back of the body, limp head, and being pulled on one side of the hands and feet, these are all untreatable conditions. </p>
<p>For those who have a persistent cough, closed eyes, fatigue, pale face, and shaking hands, they are also untreatable. </p>
<p>If there are healing sores and scabies, accompanied by abdominal distension, gas, and chaotic discomfort, these cases are likewise untreatable. </p>
<p>If a child cries a lot at night, with eyes rolled up, but appears somewhat calm during the day, this is due to internal fright. This may be caused by cold air leading to abdominal pain, resulting in extreme pain and fixed gaze. The treatment involves burning lamp wick ash and mixing it with boiling white water to form a pill that, once ingested, eases the pain and alleviates the condition. </p>
<p>If a child cries both day and night, with eyes fixed and unable to turn to the side, and lying backward, this is due to external fright.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Due to the accumulation of food causing pain, the body becomes rigid, the face turns red, and the eyes are fixed. The treatment involves using earth from the stove, boiling it in white water, and taking it with Dingxiang Piji Pill, resulting in the cessation of pain and the retreat of the disease. </p>
<p>If a child has lung congestion with wheezing and fullness, tightness in the chest, and the ribs are heaving, with depressions formed, wide-open nasal passages, chaotic coughing, a dry, hoarse voice, and phlegm obstructing, with both urination and defecation blocked, this is termed spleen wind. If not treated urgently or treated without recognizing the symptoms, there is a risk of death within days. It is advisable to first use Niuhuang Duoming Powder for treatment, followed by Baihu Decoction for adjustment.</p>
<p>If a child suddenly experiences breathlessness with phlegm, while their mouth and eyes are normal, the hands and feet are not twitching, and there is no fever present, this indicates an invasion of wind-cold into the lung meridian. Using Qiongxie Powder will provide immediate relief.</p>
<p>If a child shows alternating movement of the fingers, and the eyes are somewhat fixed in gaze, this indicates Baihu syndrome. However, there is no fever, and the hands and feet are not cold. The treatment should involve taking soil from the  White Tiger formula of this year, boiling it in white broth, and swallowing Suhexiang Wan Powder.</p>
<p>If a child develops convulsions from measles, only use Daohong San with mercury powder. This will take effect in one dose. It is crucial not to recklessly use cooling, calming, or life-preserving medicines.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>In cases of children&#39;s convulsions, it is essential to distinguish between acute and chronic causes. Acute involves real heat resulting in coldness seeking relief, while chronic pertains to deficiency and cold requiring warming tonics. Acute occurs from wind, cold, or food accumulation, while chronic arises from prolonged illness. Accurately distinguishing these conditions reveals exceptional skill.</p>
<p>Acute convulsions emerge suddenly with great heat, which can lead to wind. Phlegm and fluids block the throat, causing facial and oral distortion and heaviness. First, use the Sneezing Marvel Powder, followed by the Guide Red method to clear blockages. Moxa should be applied to the Lesser Shang and Middle Chong points, using the cooling methods for heat and convulsions.</p>
<p>Chronic convulsions are often a result of severe illness, with a sudden decline in spirit and spleen deficiency. The affected child may appear lethargic, sighing heavily, with an open mouth and distorted face. There may be moments of twitching, with limbs becoming cold. The method of warming and expelling should be applied urgently to the interior, and if not healed, moxibustion should be performed on the left breast.</p>
<p>If the condition is due to external cold, sweating should be induced first. A decoction of cooling pills can be supplemented with scorpion and silkworm. If it is indeed due to internal injury from food, it must be accompanied by purging. Use the Three Yellow and Five Colors as necessary to eliminate heat and stop convulsions.</p>
<p>To recognize alarming signs of convulsions, the face may appear reddened like it is painted. The mouth may be open, with saliva flowing and teeth clenched, breathing rapidly and voice hoarse. The throat may feel as though it is being pulled by a saw, and sweat may appear like beads. The eyes may bulge and twitch, and loud cries may arise from fear.</p>
<p>The condition might see sudden onset and cessation of convulsions, with phlegm and qi in constant turmoil. In a faint, stuporous state, there may be no awareness of eating or swallowing. Urine and feces may be expelled without perception, and the limbs may be rigid and difficult to retract. The cry is urgent, with hot sweat resembling oil; even potent elixirs may offer no salvation.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable and Effective Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian]</strong></p>

<h3>On Treating Fright-Induced Illness</h3>
<p>According to various books, sudden fright is easy to treat, while chronic fright is difficult to treat; this has been a common understanding through the ages. The insights derived from wise individuals suggest that there is a unique methodology behind this, with recorded treatments embodying the subtle essences of true immortals. Similar to when a child suffers from illness due to fright, cold, heat, phlegm, or food, each has its origin. The methods of treatment are exceptionally different from common knowledge. For instance, cold pertains to the bladder, fright heat to the heart, wind to the liver, and phlegm and food to the spleen and stomach. According to the teachings of the Tang family on the young, fright and phlegm commonly follow each other, and it is crucial to observe the location and color of the pulse to uncover the underlying causes of the illness for effective treatment.</p>
<h3>Fright</h3>
<p>The pulse can be found at three points: the temples, the forehead, and the area between the eyebrows.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Red and tender indicates an initial shock and heat.<br>Purple veins suggest a greater shock and heat.<br>The temples are related to the kidneys; the hairline is tied to the bladder; the glabella pertains to the heart.<br>If the temples are red and the glabella is blue, this indicates a subtle deviation of heart from excessive sexual energy.<br>If both temples and glabella are purple-red, it signifies light illness as before.<br>If the temples are blue and the glabella is red, it indicates that the kidney&#39;s correct and incorrect energies are overcoming heart fire, which must be perilous.<br>If both temples and glabella are blue, it indicates serious illness as previously mentioned.<br>If there is added redness above the left temple, it suggests wind and internal heat.<br>If the corner of the eye is red up to the brows, it transforms into two forms of heat, causing shock.<br>Left temple redness suggests harm from wind and mother’s milk.<br>Right temple red and blue indicates harm from cold in mother’s milk.  </p>
<p><strong>Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>Pulse examination focuses on the left temple and wind pool.<br>If the left temple and wind pool are red, the wind evil is light; if blue, it means a heavy wind evil.<br>The left temple is linked to the bladder; the left taiyin relates to the kidneys; the left wind pool corresponds to the liver; the right wind pool is associated with the mingmen (gate of life).<br>If the left temple is red, it indicates an initial injury from wind heat.<br>If the left taiyin is red, it shows initial cold sensitivity.<br>If the left wentai is red and hot for five to seven days, it means the transmission has occurred.<br>If the left temple is purple, it indicates repeated injuries from wind.<br>If the left taiyin is purple, it indicates repeated occurrences of cold.<br>If the left wentai is purple, it suggests two to four occurrences of heat.<br>If the right wentai is purple, it implies persistent heat that does not recede.<br>If the left temple is blue, the wind transforms into steam.<br>If the left taiyin is blue, it leads to shock.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Left Wen Tai is blue, yet the transmission of the classics remains unresolved in heat.<br>The center of the forehead turns red with the wind, heat gives rise to surprise.</p>
<p>Phlegm</p>
<p>Right Taiyang pertains to the Sanjiao. Right Taiyin pertains to the Spleen. Right Wen Tai pertains to the Lungs. Right Wu Tai pertains to the Stomach. Right Taiyang appears red and blue, consuming maternal formula, catching a cold and heat from milk.<br>A blue forehead center, blue right Taiyin, and blue right Wen Tai indicate phlegm and food issues. A red forehead center signifies heart heat generating phlegm.<br>A black-blue forehead center indicates fetal phlegm and drinks causing surprise.<br>A purple forehead center indicates hot phlegm.<br>A blue-yellow forehead center indicates windy phlegm.<br>Blue-purple right Taiyin indicates injuries from cold and wind in milk.<br>Blue left Taiyin indicates injuries from cold in milk.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Blue right Taiyin alongside blue Wen Tai and blue Wu Tai all relate to food. If there is food injury due to overeating, either from cold hard items or greasy foods, resulting in headache and fever, vomiting undigested food, and stomach pain as if injured, the treatment is to use Li Lu Powder to induce vomiting; if food stagnates in the stomach, causing vomiting and pain, one should use San Wu Decoction to purge it.<br>For food stagnation due to a weak stomach unable to digest, with fullness and tightness in the chest, and stomach pain, use Hua Tie Wan to digest food and Er Chen Decoction for unblocking. If there is central food stagnation caused by a child&#39;s weak Spleen and Stomach, often resulting in retained liquid or overeating along with drinking leading to undigested food and blockage in the Sanjiao, manifesting as convulsions like fright, or confusion as if dreaming or drunk, with disturbed thoughts and fever, Jin Xing Wan is indicated for treatment.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Wu Xian</strong></p>
<p>Wu Xian is a disease that causes the limbs to become incapacitated, affecting either one hand and one foot or both hands and both feet, leading to a state resembling paralysis and lack of response. It may involve drooping eyes, drooping mouth, or a crooked mouth, pulling at the cheek muscles.</p>
<p>Shi Xian is a disease caused by consuming meat that harms the body, resulting in twitching of the limbs. There may be arching of the back, or convulsions, or loud barking like a dog, often accompanied by vomiting of food. The consumed food is completely enveloped in phlegm and saliva.</p>
<p>Jing Xian is a disease that affects the head and eyes, resulting in drooping of the mouth and eyes. This may happen in one eye or both eyes, leading to confusion or blindness, cross-eyed vision, or a drooping head, as well as nodding or trembling of the head.</p>
<p>Tan Xian is characterized by an erratic condition that may not frequently occur, sometimes manifesting every six months, every year, every month, or even once or three times a day. The entire body may convulse without affecting the limbs or head, causing the person to appear confused, as if in a dream or half-drunk, unaware of their surroundings under the light, all resulting from dreams, explaining its irregularity. Suddenly, hearing may be lost, or vision may be impaired, resembling madness.</p>
<p>Yin Xian is a disease in which the individual fails to recognize fullness when eating, suddenly not desiring food for several days, with twitching limbs occurring mostly in a dreamy state. Overeating can also trigger an episode.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The disease known as &quot;痓&quot; (zhì) resembles an invasion by cold pathogens. If a patient is afflicted, there is a ninety percent mortality rate. Moreover, in cases of febrile diseases caused by heat and those resulting from heatstroke, the survival rate is nearly nonexistent. Symptoms include headache, fever, and stiffness in the neck, preventing the individual from turning their head. They may shake their head and keep their mouth shut, responding to questions with complete silence. Gradually, the body might exhibit a bowing posture as mucus obstructs the throat, leading to death. Treatments include various formulas: Zhang Zhongjing’s Guo Lou Ge Gen Decoction, Xiao Xu Ming Decoction with musk, and the large-scale Fang Feng Decoction. Additionally, there are over a hundred recorded formulas by different practitioners, each boasting its strengths, yet the Qian family’s pulse diagnosis is superior to others.

<p><strong>Fright</strong></p>
<p>Acute fright, a result of excessive liver wind with accompanying heart fire. Wood generates fire; if it arises from a prior condition, it should be expelled. The remedy Qingwan pills should be used to clear the liver wind, and Daochi powder to reduce heart fire. Chronic fright, as described by Qian, occurs when spleen deficiency causes phlegm and wind; this is due to weakened spleen earth allowing liver wood to dominate. The liver belongs to wood and the spleen to earth, thus the invading evil is difficult to combat, making chronic fright hard to treat. For spleen deficiency causing wind, one should supplement. Dongyuan recommends the Tiaoyuan decoction with added white peony to remedy this; it uses astragalus and ginseng to nourish spleen deficiency, while white peony and licorice drain excess from the liver. This is indeed an ancient and rarely transmitted secret method. I add cinnamon to make it the Huangqi Jianzhong decoction; wood with cinnamon becomes wilted. Traditional methods for treating chronic fright include Jingpi powder and Xian gao powder, both effective remedies.</p>
<p>Someone asked: How should a skilled practitioner treat acute and chronic fright before they occur? The answer: When the heat is extreme, with flushed cheeks, a red face, and eyes fixed and unblinking, these are signs of fright. One should take Hekian Danggui Longhui pills to clear liver and gallbladder fire, preventing the onset of acute fright. When there is persistent vomiting or diarrhea, with cold hands and feet, sleepy eyes, and cool breath from the mouth and nose, these symptoms indicate a tendency toward chronic fright. One should urgently use Shenling Baizhu powder to nourish the spleen and the Hupo Baolong pills, removing bitter orange peel and adding astragalus to pacify the liver, preventing the development of chronic fright. This is my family’s secret method.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>After the shock, if the qi does not disperse, it becomes stagnant and produces phlegm. This phlegm generates heat, and the heat causes wind, leading to convulsions. This is what Chen describes as qi reversing and causing convulsions, which brings about shock. This is different from the term &quot;sudden wind.&quot;</p>
<p>For those who convulse due to shock, it indicates that the heart fire is strong and the liver wood is overpowering it. First, we should stop the convulsions and administer a decoction made with Zhikang San, swallowing it along with Hejian Danggui Longhui Wan; then calm the spirit using Qian&#39;s Anshen Wan. For those with phlegm and fluid obstruction, first reduce the phlegm using Chen Sha Gao, then stop the convulsions, and finally calm the spirit.</p>
<p>Acute shock wind belongs to yang, and conditions in the six fu organs are easier to treat with cooling and purging methods. Chronic shock wind belongs to yin, and conditions in the five zang organs are harder to treat and require warming and tonifying methods.</p>
<p>Someone might ask: Why are there both acute and chronic, yin and yang conditions? I would say: The liver governs wind, which is wood. No movement is as sudden and rapid as wind. The heart governs shock, which is fire. Nothing is as violent and soaring as fire. Thus, both wood and fire are yang; therefore, when the condition affects the heart and liver, it is considered acute and belongs to yang. The spleen and stomach represent earth, which is heavy and slow, more so than earth itself. The spleen belongs to the extreme yin, so when the condition affects the spleen, it is considered chronic and belongs to yin. The liver is generally in excess; when in excess, it can spill over and damage itself. The spleen is generally insufficient; when insufficient, it needs to be supplemented and benefited. While the heart governs shock and the liver governs wind, they should rightly be discussed together. Fire contributes to the force of wind, and wind aids the power of fire, thus they can induce convulsions together, so they should not be treated separately. There are overlapping manifestations and similar symptoms of shock wind that should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Causes of Sudden Fever</strong></p>
<p>There are three causes of sudden fever:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>External Causes</strong>: Such as contracting wind, cold, or dampness leading to fever. In this case, it is advisable to expel and harmonize to eliminate the heat. If this is neglected and left untreated, severe heat can lead to convulsions. For illnesses caused by this, the use of Daohong San (Peach Blossom Powder) and Xieqing Wan (Clear Green Pill) is appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Internal Causes</strong>: Such as fever from overeating or poor digestion. It is necessary to eliminate and guide downwards, using medications like Baohuan Wan or Sanhuang Zhizhu Wan to clear the heat. If neglected and untreated, severe heat can lead to convulsions. One should observe the condition of bowel movements. If there is constipation, one should first eliminate retained food, using Wuxiang Binglang Wan or bile-guiding methods. If the stool is loose, the appropriate remedies are Chensha Wuling San or Hupo Baolong Wan.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Neither Internal Nor External Causes</strong>: Occurs due to shock or fright. The heart houses the spirit, and fright can harm the spirit; the kidneys contain will and essence, and fear can damage the kidneys. The classics say: the movement of the spirit is called the soul, and the entry and exit of essence is called the po. Thus, if the spirit is harmed, the soul departs; if the essence is harmed, the po disperses. Children are typically timid and weak in spirit, so sudden fright can disrupt their mental state, causing the soul and po to scatter, with reversed qi and phlegm accumulation leading to convulsions. If fright occurs unexpectedly, even adults can be startled, let alone children. It is advisable to first clear the phlegm using Chensha Gao (Cinnabar Ointment) and then calm the spirit using Hupo Baolong Wan. For cases of heat, use Dongyuan Anshen Wan (Calm the Shen Pill). When using medications to clear phlegm, one should be cautious not to use harsh substances like light powder or Ba Dou, as they may harm the vital energy, damage the spleen and stomach, and endanger the child’s life.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>After a fright</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For those who develop abscesses and paralysis after a fright, the Left School suggests it is due to the wind&#39;s disturbance causing later illness. The liver governs the tendons; if the liver is hot, the tendons become elongated and weak, preventing the hands and feet from bending. If the liver is cold, the tendons contract and shorten, preventing the hands and feet from extending. In both cases, the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill is recommended. For contraction, add aconite and cinnamon; for weakness, add goldthread, anemarrhena, angelica, achyranthes, and gentian. These should be taken in honey pills. </p>
<p>After a fright, if one becomes mute and cannot speak, the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill with added chuanxiong, polygala, and sweet rush is indicated.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>The heart stores the spirit; when startled, it injures the spirit. The kidneys store the will; when fearful, it injures the will. Children with weak spirits become frightened; when startled, their spirits lose their guard, resulting in epilepsy. As it is said in texts, when one requests a monk to write a name and the monk performs a blessing, if the child is frightened, this can lead to epilepsy. Later, upon seeing someone in black clothing, the condition may recur. There are also cases where prolonged fright causes epilepsy; if addressed early, it can be treated with specific formulas. If parents neglect it for long, it becomes a lifelong affliction.</p>
<p><strong>Tian Diao (Heavenly Hook) and Nei Diao (Inner Hook)</strong></p>
<p>The Tian Diao corresponds to the foot Jueyin liver channel, beginning at the big toe and ascending around the genital area, crossing left to right and right to left, entering the lower abdomen, connecting with the Governing Vessel, and traveling up the spine to the crown. If wind harms the liver, it causes Tian Diao, characterized by upward-rolling eyes, the head tilted back, and the body bending backward like a bow. Qian says: when the liver is affected by wind, it causes extreme bowing. Tian Diao belongs to wood and should be dispersed; for this, one should use Qingxiao Pill, removing Da Huang, and adding Tianma, Quanxie, Jiangcan, and Diao Teng.</p>
<p>Nei Diao occurs when the liver is cold, presenting as lower abdominal pain, loud crying, and direct gaze, but without ear twitching. It should be urgently warmed internally using Angelica and Cornelian Cherry Decoction and Wood Fragrance Pill. </p>
<p>If asked: Tian Diao and Nei Diao concerning the disease and what organ they belong to, and how to distinguish them, one may refer to the classic: if the affliction is above half of the body, it is governed by heavenly energy; if below that, it is governed by earthly energy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Therefore, the external channels of the Great Hook are located above, born from wind and heat, and should be dispelled; the internal channels of the Inner Hook are located below, born from cold, and should be warmed. Both hooks are connected to the Jueyin meridian, externally following the Du meridian, ascending along the spine to reach the top of the head. When there is illness, the eyes may roll upwards, and the back may arch, resembling a bowstring that has been forcibly pulled. Internally, they follow the yin energy into the lower abdomen, causing pain that may be mistaken for a cyst. Dizziness from wind belongs to the liver’s wood aspect, hence both hooks exhibit symptoms of twitching, as if startled. However, the external hook may cry or laugh, while the internal hook tends to produce weeping sounds. The disease of convulsions belongs to the Yangming bladder meridian, beginning from the eyes, passing over the head, and descending along the back of the hands, following the waist down. This is similar to the downward flow of the Jueyin meridian, hence the symptoms of bowstring tension are also similar. However, while the external hook may twitch, the convulsion disease does not manifest twitching. Pain in the intestines belongs to the Yangming small intestine meridian. Internally, it travels through the lower abdomen, differing from the path of the Jueyin meridian, which can lead to sudden pain in the lower abdomen. However, the internal hook may exhibit spasms, while the pain in the intestines does not display discernible spasms.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Secrets of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heavenly and Internal Seizures</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly seizure resembles epilepsy. The symptoms are intense heat and palpitations, with rolling eyes and seizures in the limbs, alternating between crying and laughing, having fluctuating emotions; in severe cases, the nails turn blue, resembling a demonic affliction. This is related to liver disease but does not involve drowsiness. It is advisable to dispel wind and resolve the evil to achieve recovery, and the remedy is Dai Tong San (a type of herbal formula).</p>
<p>Internal seizure also resembles epilepsy. The symptoms include abdominal pain and frequent crying, blackened lips and cysts, hunched posture, and red streaks or spots in the eyes. This, too, is liver disease but does not cause confusion or lethargy; rather, it is caused by cold air. Initially, there will be spasms of internal organs, leading to extreme pain and frantic cries that can cause diarrhea and leg retraction, along with abdominal pain and crying. After the internal seizure passes, external symptoms such as seizure recur, and with internal and external attacks, it becomes extremely difficult to regulate; treatment requires both internal and external medicine. In severe cases of internal seizures, it is advisable to use a balm of frankincense.</p>
<p>According to the two symptoms of heavenly and internal seizures, many infants suffer from them within a hundred days. Both of these conditions are related to liver disease. The liver meridian, known as Jue Yin, internally connects to the small intestine and externally to the back; therefore, external wind-heat results in heavenly seizures, while internal cold damage leads to internal seizures. Hence, it is said: heavenly seizures are yang, while internal seizures are yin.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Children&#39;s Disorders of Sudden Convulsion</p>
<pre><code>        Infants&#39; Questions [Ming Dynasty, Lu Bosi]

            Convulsions
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of sudden convulsions, first observe the clenched fists. If the fingers are inward, it indicates a passive condition; if outward, it is active. For males, the left side is associated with convulsions; for females, the right side. One must use medications to open the channels thoroughly. It is critical to avoid phlegm entering the lung or reversing into the heart, which can cause an inability to speak. In such cases, one should administer calming heart medicine and phlegm-reducing drugs to stabilize. If the convulsion is reversed, immediate assistance is futile. If the condition arises from vomiting or diarrhea, it will be difficult to treat. Generally, one should observe the nature of the clenched fists; if the convulsion is in order, regulation is easier; if reversed, there may be a recurrence. Start with opening channel medicines like &quot;Sheng Nian Er&quot; and &quot;Bao Ming Dan,&quot; followed by medications to disperse wind, resolve phlegm, and reduce heat, usually ensuring safety.</p>
<p>There are also instances of convulsions due to fright, excessive crying, sudden convulsions with tears from the eyes, and a red face indicating difficulty in recovery. If the child becomes overly emotional with phlegm accumulation in the heart, visible red veins on the face indicate epilepsy. Mismanaged convulsive patterns can lead to further incidences of fright and excessive sinking, where the wind illness does not dissipate and is counter to the qi. The convulsion becomes erratic, thus one should switch to qi-dispelling wind medications, using &quot;Wen Dan Tang&quot; mixed with sour jujube seeds, followed by &quot;Sheng Feng Tang&quot; and &quot;Hua Su Qing Wan.&quot; </p>
<p>In cases of sudden partial convulsions, if the face turns pale and the back feels cold, treatment is acceptable for males on the left and females on the right; but for males on the right and females on the left, it is more challenging. If there is cold sweat in the palms, and the child convulses in the brow and abdomen, is unstable day and night, this is termed true convulsion.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>When both shoulders move, this is a sign of seizure; it not only stabilizes the convulsion but also requires the regulation of Qi. At this moment, one should take soup to settle the stomach Qi; then administer medicines like Chuanwu and Quanxie, alongside Qi-regulating medicines, while ensuring proper circulation. Zhong Yang discusses convulsions that occur after wind. If convulsions arise after catching a cold, with hot breath from the mouth, feelings of drowsiness, and trembling hands and feet, one should disperse the condition, using Da Qing Gao as the primary treatment. </p>
<p>If convulsions ensue after food injury, accompanied by body warmth, excessive sleep, excessive salivation, or reluctance to eat leading to convulsions, one must first stabilize the convulsions, eliminate them, using white cakes, and then take calming pills. Furthermore, if convulsions occur within a hundred days, genuine cases result in death after three or four times, while false cases recur frequently but are not severe. Genuine cases stem from internal excitement, while false cases arise from external cold wind. This signifies that the blood and Qi are not sufficient, leading to convulsions. </p>
<p>To distinguish false cases, observe that hot breath emerges from the mouth; treatment should focus on dispersal using Da Qing Gao, while employing external methods such as pearl pills to eliminate phlegm will stop the convulsions. For those with heat and no bowel movement, using the Seven Treasures Heart Washing Powder for dispersion will be effective. Furthermore, one should employ methods to intercept wind and stabilize convulsions with Tianma Fangfeng pills, Longchi Powder, and Diaoteng Powder for regulation. For cases with heat sores or inability to speak, Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder and Dalianqiao Decoction are both suitable for administration.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Shock</strong></p>
<p>Sudden shock occurs when a child has excessive heat-phlegm affecting the heart and stomach. When they hear an unusual sound, it causes sudden fright and spasms. If the heat is extreme, even without any external stimulus or shock, they may still experience spasms. Symptoms of sudden shock include tightness of the jaw, intense heat with a swelling of saliva, erratic eye movement, spasms and trembling (the fingers open and close), frequent blinking of the lips, mouth, eyebrows, and eyes, hot breath, flushed cheeks and lips, yellowish urine and stools, with a pulse that is floating, rapid, surging, and tense. This is due to internal excess heat combined with wind pathogenic factors; the heart channel is affected by heat leading to accumulation of shock, while the liver channel produces wind causing spasms. </p>
<p>The main treatment involves using medications in an orderly fashion. After opening the channels, one should focus on stopping wind and stabilizing spasms. If phlegm-heat is still present, it should be resolved; once phlegm-heat is discharged, immediate attention should be given to harmonizing the stomach and stabilizing the mind. If spasms are resolved and phlegm-heat is reduced, then lighter medications to eliminate phlegm and heat can be sufficient. It is crucial to act quickly when addressing sudden shock, and one must not excessively use cold and cool agents or harsh substances like silver powder or mirabilite abruptly. Such heavy medications should only be used when absolutely necessary, as they only alleviate the condition temporarily. Incorrect or excessive use can often lead to chronic shock. </p>
<p>This condition can also be treated by opening the nose and clearing the channels, inducing sneezing; once the jaw is relaxed, gentler medications to disperse wind, transform phlegm, and reduce heat, such as Daodi San, Chai Hu, and Tian Ma, can be safely administered. The Amber Powder is a key remedy for various types of shock. The Zhibao Dan can also be taken.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>Slow shock manifests in various ways: it can involve vomiting or diarrhea, phlegm sounds with slight wheezing, eyes wide open but spirit sluggish, keeping the eyes open while sleeping, sudden starts and spasms, alternating between agitation and calmness, body heat and coldness, warm limbs with cool air from the mouth and nose, a pale white or bluish complexion, or blue eyebrows and lips. The pulse is deep, slow, scattered, and weak, usually resulting from sudden fright, excessive use of cold and coolness, or a drastic downward shift leading to changes. There are also cases of persistent vomiting and diarrhea, issues of qi deficiency leading to sudden vomiting and diarrhea, dysfunctions in the organs causing unrestrained leakage, prolonged diarrhea resulting in qi depletion, repercussions from excessive purging of accumulated matter, vomiting or passing blood, effects of wind leading to unresolved cold damage, persistent cough leading to seizures, heart-invading parasites, and hernias causing abdominal pain.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Sometimes one experiences day and night sweating, spleen dysfunction leading to excessive sleep, irritability prompting thirst, swelling of the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, toxic growths, abdominal pain with a sensation of tightness around the waist, rapid onset of ulceration, and a gradual transmission of symptoms. If vomiting and diarrhea lead to a state of deficiency, the condition will worsen quickly. The treatment must be based on careful inquiry into the root causes; one cannot indiscriminately use medication referred to as a gradual transmission.</p>
<p>If the condition arises from vomiting or diarrhea, then administer the Li Zhong Tang (Regulate the Middle Decoction) with the addition of Mu Xiang to warm the interior, or use Wu Ling San (Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria) to guide out excess fluids. If it arises from cold in the organs leading to loose stools, then first administer the Shu Fu Tang (Atractylodes and Aconite Decoction). If it results from accumulated food leading to a downward shift, first use the Tiao Qi San (Regulate Qi Powder) to harmonize the spleen and stomach. If it is an external attack of wind-cold, then formulas such as Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) or Ge Gen Tang (Kudzu Decoction) may be appropriate, and others can be inferred accordingly.</p>
<p>However, though chronic fright belongs to yin, one must still assess the balance of yin and yang in terms of deficiency and excess, shallow and deep conditions. One cannot purely rely on warming medicines or strong, overly hot formulas. Instead, it is vital to add medications that stabilize wind and calm spasms to strengthen the genuine qi of the stomach, such as Quan Xie (Scorpion), Hua She (Snake), Jiang Can (Silkworm), Bai Fu Zi (White Convolvulus), Tian Ma (Gastrodia), and Nan Xing (Arisaema).</p>
<p>For cases of gradual transmission still displaying yang symptoms, there is no need to restore yang, but one should employ strategies to stabilize wind and regulate the stomach, whether cooling or warming, ensuring a balanced approach to yin and yang.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Taiyi Precious Birth Pill, Gathering Treasure Pill, Cicada-Scorpion Powder, Divine Treasure Equilibrium Pill, Recovery Pill, Wang&#39;s Awakening Powder, Awakening Spleen Powder, Great Awakening Spleen Powder, Warm White Pill, may be chosen for use. If Yang is deficient and Yin is excessive, the illness has already progressed, purely due to chronic fright, with no signs of spasms or retreating movements, but only heaviness, then use Star Fragrance Whole Scorpion Powder, Fixed Destiny Decoction, Four Holy Powder, Black Scorpion Four Gentlemen Decoction, Tian Nanxing Powder, Black Sinking Decoction, or Agarwood Powder. If hands and feet are cold, then one may restore Yang with sulfur and Aconite. For chronic fright with phlegm: if the body is relaxed, use Tian Nanxing Pill, Suhe Fragrance Pill, or White Pill; if phlegm is excessive, use Divine Treasure Equilibrium Pill or Stone Powder. If very deficient and unable to expel phlegm, use Lingzhi Pill or Seven Treasures Pill. Avoid using any cold or cooling substances like musk, ivory frost, or similar.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>If there is delayed fright, one must first sleep. Signs include sticking out the tongue and shaking the head, a pale face with hair standing on end, vomiting with a foul smell, and sweating on the forehead. This indicates post-vomiting stomach deficiency resulting in wind. Immediately intercept the wind and awaken the spleen with a decoction, or use Si Jun Zi Decoction with full scorpion and wind-protecting herbs, or Yin Bai San, or Diao Teng Decoction in place of Ma Huang. It is beneficial to prepare various medicines and food early, and one must not take it lightly. </p>
<p>In cases of slow fright about to occur, with diarrhea and vomiting foul milk, cold sweat, eyes closed, red lips and protruding tongue, shaking head with hair standing up, movement in both sides, feeling chest tightness and coarse breathing, along with mouth sores, use Nao Xing powder and apply it to the soles of the feet and regularly take Ren Shen decoction. If there are mouth sores and refusal to take milk or food, known as &#39;locked diaphragm&#39;, recovery is difficult. </p>
<p>For any pediatric illnesses, if the mouth resembles a fish&#39;s mouth making a crowing sound, do not treat. The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; contains medicine such as Amber Pill and Nao Xing Decoction, which can be taken. It is stated: the heart harbors the spirit and dislikes heat. Children naturally possess a lot of heat; if they are affected by wind evils, the wind-heat combines in the organs, causing the qi to become stagnant, which unsettles the heart and disrupts the child&#39;s spirit, thus resulting in fright. If the fright is severe and persists, it leads to palpitations. This is treated with Zi Jin San, Niu Huang San, and Da Dan Sha Wan. For acute fright, there are Long Chi San, Ju Sheng San, and other remedies available for use.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Spleen Wind</strong></p>
<p>In the case of chronic spleen wind, the face is pale, the tongue is short, and the head is lowered. The eyes are closed and cannot be opened; during sleep, the head sways and the tongue is thrust out. There are frequent occurrences of vomiting with a foul odor, the mouth is tightly shut and the teeth are clenched. The hands and feet may twitch slightly but cannot be fully retracted. The body may be cold or warm, but the limbs are cold. The pulse is faint and submerged, indicating an extreme excess of yin energy and a significant deficiency of stomach energy, with a ratio of ten to one or two saved. This condition arises after chronic fright, which damages the spleen through vomiting and diarrhea. The illness manifests fully as a deficiency, primarily affecting the spleen, hence it is referred to as spleen wind. If one tries to expel the wind, there is no wind to chase away; if one attempts to treat fright, there is no fright to treat. Instead, phlegm and fluids stagnate in the spleen due to virtual heat. The inability to open the eyes indicates the spleen is exhausted and energy is lacking, causing a state of confusion and stagnation of phlegm and fluids. What is commonly known as chronic wind difficult to treat pertains to chronic spleen wind. Furthermore, chronic spleen wind is also referred to as virtual wind. Generally, after a child has experienced vomiting or diarrhea, they exhibit a pale yellow complexion and a significant overall deficiency.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>If heat arises from emptiness, it will inevitably lead to a sluggish spleen wind, as seen in symptoms such as head shaking, direct staring, touching others with the hands, drowsiness, excessive sweating on the forehead, and the body being clammy with sweat. The voice will be low, soft, and strained; this indicates a spleen wind condition, which does not necessarily stem from the rapid transmission of wind. </p>
<p>The main treatment principles involve reviving the stomach&#39;s yang. One can use equal parts of He Shou Wu Decoction, Chuan Wu Powder, Golden Liquid Pill, and White Pill, and adjust with Four Noble Herbs Decoction as needed. As the stomach qi gradually recovers, one may then apply warming and balancing remedies such as Scorpion and Attachments Powder, and Yin Xian Powder can also be considered for use. </p>
<p>If the eyes are half-open and half-closed, and the hands and feet are not cold, indicating that the symptoms still exhibit slow shock, then reviving yang is not necessary. If there is already a sluggish spleen condition with yang qi not yet fully depleted, then using Sulfur and Aconite Pills is also inappropriate. </p>
<p>When administering restorative yang decoctions, if the hands and feet gradually warm, continue with dispersing the spleen powder and then adjust treatment accordingly; one should not casually use extreme remedies.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Quick and Slow Spleen Wind and Phlegm: Weight and Lightness</strong></p>
<p>For slow phlegm with light symptoms, use Shenbao Jiji Dan or Baijiangcan Wan; for heavier cases, Shen Sha Gao; and in severe cases, Qi Baomiao Sha Dan. If the moxibustion for slow spleen and wind, along with various medicines for alarming or adverse symptoms, are ineffective, check the Taichong pulse and then moxibust the Baihui point, as this is crucial for treating slow spleen wind. </p>
<p>For acute symptoms, there are three treatments: for light cases, use Dingming Dan, Lijing Wan, Fangfeng Tang, Xuanfeng San, Zhike San, or Xiao Chaihu Tang; for heavier cases, use Qingjin Wan, Tianma Wan, Luye San, Niuhuang Liangge Wan, Qingjin Dan, or Wang Jianjing Mo Wan; and for moderately heavy cases, use Jie Feng Tang, Zhushagao, Shufeng San, or Chaihu Jia Dahuang Tang.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>After the onset, it is advisable to use gentle and calming treatments to support the stomach, such as Shengqi San, Yinbai Wan, Fu Ling Er Chen Tang, Yigong San, Tianma Suhexiang Wan, Shenling Baizhu San, Hezhong San, and Xingpi San, among others. In cases of sudden fright with rolling eyes, bleeding from the mouth, shaking legs, abdominal convulsions, touch sensitivity on skin, difficulty in breathing with coughing, and severe pain in the mouth with loud cries, the condition is difficult to treat. In chronic fright, with cold limbs, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, a dark face with pale lips, a crowing sound in the chest, gas movement in the sides, white sores in the mouth, stiffness and head shaking, unresponsive eyes, drooling and wheezing, or involuntary pulling of one side of the mouth, eyes, hands, and feet, treatment is hard. In chronic cases with coldness, sticky sweat, lying still like a corpse, soft head with difficulty breathing, incontinence of urine and feces, and clenching of the mouth with head shaking are the most challenging. If the fright is severe, administer Zhenxin Wan to calm the heart and resolve phlegm, or Jinbo Zhenxin Wan; one may also use Zhenzhu Wan which is effective in resolving phlegm. If there is severe heat with constipation, one may use Huanshan San to relieve it.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Shock Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy is a severe illness that affects young children. Their immature blood vessels and undeveloped bones are vulnerable to the invasion of wind pathogens, startled by sudden fright, or disrupted due to irregular breastfeeding, which obstructs the meridians leading to this condition. Symptoms include a disturbed spirit, wide-open eyes staring blankly, facial contortions, a clenched mouth with drooling, a bloated abdomen, and spasms in the hands and feet, appearing as if they are alive but often unresponsive. They may alternate between vocalizing and silence, with either arching back or rigidity in the spine, while the limbs remain soft; this is termed epilepsy. If the body is rigid and unresponsive for the entire day, it is termed convulsion. </p>
<p>Epilepsy is classified into five types, each affecting one of the five organs. If the face is red and eyes tense, with tongue protrusion and teeth grinding, along with restlessness in the heart region and shortness of breath, it is called heart epilepsy. If the face and lips turn blue, the eyes roll upwards, and the hands and feet clench and spasm, it is referred to as liver epilepsy. A blackened and dull face, bulging eyes, and the mouth producing clear foam while remaining motionless like a corpse indicates kidney epilepsy. A face resembling dry bones, eyes wide open and staring, sudden jumps, and foaming at the mouth is recognized as lung epilepsy.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>The complexion is pale and yellow, the eyes stare straight ahead, the abdomen is distended and there are spontaneous bowel movements, with the limbs not retracting; this is called spleen convulsion. This is a manifestation of the five internal organs. The method of treatment involves addressing the conditions of fright, food, and wind separately. </p>
<p>For wind convulsion, if sweating occurs, it indicates release, and the wind pathogen takes advantage of weakness; initially, there may be a bending of the fingers with heat producing phlegm. </p>
<p>For fright convulsion, there is shock and terror, leading to a collapse from fright; initially, there may be loud crying, confusion, and loss of the spirit. </p>
<p>For food convulsion, being startled during meals leads to stasis overnight; initially, one may vomit undigested milk, produce foul-smelling stools, or develop milk lumps, with symptoms starting cold and then becoming hot.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between yin and yang, for the initial stage with body heat, there is twitching and loud crying, which is classified as yang convulsion. In yang disease, the pulse is floating, the complexion is radiant, and the illness resides in the six yang organs and skin, making it relatively easy to cure. </p>
<p>For the initial stage with no body heat, the hands and feet are cold, with no twitching or crying, which is classified as yin convulsion. In yin disease, the pulse is deep, the complexion is dark, and the illness resides in the five yin organs and marrow, making it most difficult to cure. </p>
<p>One may also consider that lying on the back belongs to yang, while lying to the side belongs to yin, which can be used for further verification.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Yang syndromes should not be treated with warmth, and yin syndromes should not be treated with cold. For wind-induced epilepsy, first disperse the wind; for shock-induced epilepsy, eliminate the shock; for food-induced epilepsy, first resolve the accumulation, and then use the appropriate calming agents. Generally, blood stasis in the heart or evil qi in the heart, along with accumulated shock leads to epilepsy. It is essential to clear heart shock, harmonize heart blood, regulate qi, and eliminate phlegm. Moreover, when children experience heat and phlegm, show reluctance to breastfeed, have restless sleep, and frequently experience fright and palpitations, these are all early signs of impending epilepsy, and can be addressed with Zisong pill. If the dose of Zisong pill is appropriately reduced, the risk of shock-induced epilepsy will diminish. At the onset of symptoms, if there are blue veins appearing between high bones, and they resemble coins, they must be immediately pricked to allow bloodletting, helping to clear the qi. Children’s clothing must be kept dry at night to avoid contamination from innocuous bird droppings, which can lead to epilepsy. Those with malevolent or strange dispositions may have changing and unstable colors, and will appear shy and fearful in the presence of others.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>For those suffering from convulsions and unable to speak, this is generally due to the throat being the pathway for qi (vital energy). Wind injures this qi, blocking the pathway. It may also be due to blood stagnation in the heart, leading to a failure to open the heart orifices. </p>
<p>To treat this, one can use a small amount of pig bile mixed with the southern star herb, known as Xing Su San, which is effective upon consumption. The Qian family’s Five Convulsion Pills combined with Southern Star Powder, brewed with sweet flag in broth, and mixed with Gan Sui and pig heart broth, or combined with Su He Xiang Pills, are all essential medicines for treating convulsions, thus they are listed.</p>
<p>Xu Shuwei treats children&#39;s convulsions when signs begin to show, such as dark eyes, vocal disturbances, and tongue biting, with the Chi Huang Pill. For wind-related convulsions, it is advisable to take Peppermint Powder; if there is heat, use Xi Xin and Da Huang Decoction. </p>
<p>There are also other effective formulas like She Huang Wan, Vitality Preservation Formula, Break Convulsion Pill, Wind Dispelling Pill, Bao An Pill, Du Huo Decoction, Niu Huang Wan, Bi Jin Gao, Hu Jing Wan, Seven Treasure Calming Heart Pill, Qing Shen Decoction, and Mi Tuo Seng Drink.</p>
<p>For dietary-related convulsions, universally effective remedies include Miao Sheng Dan, Tian Ma Wan, Break Convulsion Pill, Dang Gui and Da Huang Decoction, Scorpion and Tiger Powder, Dai Zhe Shi Powder, Ri Ying Dan, Di Long Powder, Quan Xiao Wu Convulsion Pills, and Xing Zhu San, which can be selectively used. For mild cases, the Hua Feng Dan can also be taken.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Startled Wind</strong></p>
<p>Startled refers to a state of empty anxiety and confusion; the spirit is timid and dispersed, phlegm and saliva come and go. Its outflow is invariably green, gradually producing wind without yet reaching it. When the startled pathogenic influence enters the heart, the face turns red and one experiences restless nighttime weeping. If it enters the liver, the face becomes green, and the eyes dart about. When it affects the kidneys, the face darkens, leading to fierce cries and grinding of teeth. If it afflicts the lungs, the face becomes pale, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue. If it enters the spleen, there is vomiting and inability to eat, excessive sweating during sleep, and a pale yellow complexion. Observing the pulse, if it is weak, it is scattered and moist; if strong, it is rapid and thick. The treatment method involves soothing the startled condition and transforming phlegm, calming the spirit, and stabilizing the will, while also understanding which organ is affected to offer appropriate adjustments. There are said to be warm startling, beneficial startling, and cool startling. The weak ones should be warmed, the strong ones should be benefited, and the hot ones should be cooled; this is called the treatment method.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>In sleep, if one wakes startled, the voice that floats is easy to treat; the one that sinks is difficult to heal. There&#39;s also the condition of accumulated fright, which lingers long and leads to such symptoms: sweating on the forehead, panting and thirstiness, alternating waves of heat, warmth in the abdomen, feeling something jumping within during sleep, and diarrhea resembling white greasy bean paste. The treatment should be adjusted according to severity and involve gentle guiding, in addition to harmonizing the qi and stomach for recovery. Generally, in young children, if the abdomen is hot, bloated, or hard, it indicates internal excess; the approach should be to evacuate and benefit. Use cinnabar paste and Qinglong pill as main treatments. Any laxative remedy can be used according to the symptoms. If there is severe heat disturbing the heart with thirst, Zhibao pill can relieve it. Qiange scatter, Fangfeng Daohong powder, cicada slough and vine drink, and Tianma pill are all applicable. For constipation, Qibao Xixing powder with added cinnabar is effective. For dysuria, Shenxiong pill and Kuanre powder work very well. For those with flowing wind, Huahuandan is also usable, as is Anshen pill.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Induced Convulsion</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly convulsion occurs when excessive consumption of alcohol and meat by the nursing mother causes toxic energies to enter the milk, leading the infant to develop internal heat in the heart and lungs, along with phlegm accumulation and qi stagnation. Additionally, external wind pathogens may contribute to this condition. The treatment principle is to disperse and relieve wind-heat for recovery. </p>
<p>There is also another type of convulsion induced internally, resulting from cold qi blockage coupled with fright. The classics state: when internal convulsions cause elevation of the chest, the symptoms may intermittently stabilize, and the appearance of red veins at the corners of the eyes is indicative. This condition arises from the presence of wind and fright in the womb, hence the symptoms.</p>
<p>Initially, there may be violent jerking in the internal organs accompanied by intense pain, causing the child to scream, or there may be diarrhea and cramping of the legs, and the child will cry out in pain. Once the internal symptoms pass, the external jerks may return, creating a challenging situation of internal and external conflict that is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>It is critical to address both aspects separately. For the internal condition, administer Ju Bao Pills, Diaoteng Paste, and Wei Xiang Powder. For the external jerks, use Diaoteng Decoction and Bao Ming Pill. It is especially important to manage the nursing aspect if possible. In cases where infants experience this illness, Yang&#39;s乳香 Pills and Mu Xiang Pills are essential medicines.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>On Sudden and Chronic Wind Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All winds causing dizziness are related to the liver element. In children under eight years old, they are considered pure Yang; their true water is not yet strong, and the heart fire is already inflamed. Therefore, the lung channel is restrained, unable to balance the wood element, leading to an excess of liver wood and a deficiency of spleen earth. For parents, if they neglect proper care—either by inappropriately adjusting clothing to the weather, allowing external evils to invade, or by mismanaging food intake, causing damage to the middle Qi—this is why conditions of sudden and chronic wind disorders arise.</p>
<p>Sudden wind disorders pertain to an excess of liver wind evil; thus, treatment should involve clearing, cooling, bitter, cold, and Qi-dispelling medicines. Chronic wind disorders relate to a deficiency of spleen earth and middle Qi; hence, treatment should involve harmonizing, sweet, warm, and tonifying medicines.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden wind disorders, these may arise from hearing unusual sounds or encountering the frightening behaviors of animals, resulting in a pale face, clenched mouth, or hoarse voice with syncope. After the episode, the complexion may return to normal, but after a while, symptoms may reappear, with the body heated and the face reddened, leading to thirst, hot sensations in the mouth and nose, yellow or reddish urine, and sleeplessness. If the heat is severe, it generates phlegm; if phlegm becomes severe, it generates wind, which can occasionally lead to seizures. The appropriate treatments include Qian’s Li Jing Pills, Xie Qing Pills, Bao Long Pills, Yi Feng San, and Wu Fu Hua Du Dan, among others.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>The symptoms of chronic fright are often caused by irregular diet, which damages the spleen and stomach, leading to prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in a significant deficiency of vital energy. When spasms occur, they are endless; the body feels cold, the complexion is yellow, there is no thirst, and the breath from the mouth and nose is cold. The urine and stool are pale, there is drowsiness with open eyes, upward gaze of the eyes, and spasms in the hands and feet with muscular rigidity. It is said that a deficiency in the spleen generates wind; when wind is rampant, the muscles become tense. This condition, often referred to as &quot;sky-hanging wind,&quot; corresponds to these signs. Treatment should include Dongyuan&#39;s Astragalus Decoction, Qian&#39;s Diao Teng Pill, Wenbai Pill, and Danxi&#39;s Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoction, combined with Zhu Sha An Shen Pill and similar remedies. Qian&#39;s theory posits that acute fright is an absence of Yin, caused by excess heat in the heart meridian, resulting in an inability of Yin to balance Yang, thus manifesting as excessive Yang and deficient Yin. Conversely, chronic fright is seen as an absence of Yang, due to severe deficiency in the spleen and earth element, leading to an inability of Yang to overcome Yin, thus manifesting as excessive Yin and deficient Yang. </p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the symptoms of acute and chronic fright in children can differ immensely in terms of deficiency and excess, as if they were worlds apart. Therefore, the mortality rate for acute fright is one in ten, whereas the mortality rate for chronic fright is one in ten for survival. Many common practitioners do not understand these principles, treating them indiscriminately, which leads to great harm. Those specializing in pediatrics should strive to understand the child’s heart as their own heart, so that this world may have no premature deaths among young children. How fortunate and fortunate that would be!<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Ming Medical Works</strong><br><strong>Wang Lun, Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Children&#39;s Illnesses Primarily Affect the Liver and Spleen Channels</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s illnesses generally belong to the channels of the spleen (Earth) and liver (Wood). The liver often has an excess, and excess symptoms, while appearing severe, are easier to treat and improve quickly. The spleen, on the other hand, tends to be deficient. Deficiency symptoms may seem mild and gradual, making treatment more difficult, with results taking longer. Among the two channels, the spleen is more frequently affected, and it is crucial to differentiate the treatment based on this. </p>
<p>If the liver (Wood) is overly vigorous, it results in sudden fright, straight gaze, potential shaking, and twitching of the limbs, as well as symptoms of phlegm and wind obstructing upward. This indicates an excess, and treatment should focus on reducing the Wood, draining the liver, and lowering fire to clear the heart. </p>
<p>If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, and the liver (Wood) comes to insult it, symptoms like fright and twitching may also appear but tend to be mild and gradual; this is termed chronic fright. In this case, it is important to nourish the spleen and stomach, avoiding misdiagnosing the spleen channel as the one needing treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For sudden fright due to wind and fire, with the spleen (Earth) being constrained and the liver channel having full heat, one can use Qing Pills to directly drain the liver or Dao Chi Powder to relieve heat. If the liver channel has deficiency heat, using Liu Wei Di Huang Wan can nourish the kidney water, while Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction can strengthen the spleen (Earth), allowing the wind and wood to settle and restoring peace to the spleen.</p>
<p>If due to improper milk and food intake, there is damage to the spleen and stomach, leading the Wood to insult the Earth, it may resemble chronic fright with symptoms such as twitching, head shaking, and teeth grinding; for this, one should use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added Diao Teng (Uncaria). If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, with cold water countering the Earth, causing chronic fright and the previous symptoms, add ginger and cinnamon to the previous remedies. If there is still no response, increase Aconite, as many recover from this method.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>Acute fright is a symptom of excess, related to the liver wood and heart fire. When the yang evil is too strong, it should be directly purged; thus, lowering fire and resolving phlegm is necessary. All five organs have their yin and yang; the liver qi is yang and fire, while the liver blood is yin and water. When the liver qi is abundant, the liver blood will be deficient; when fire moves recklessly, the water will be boiled and disturbed. Strong yang causes weak yin. When wind and fire clash, yin and blood scatter, which is inevitable; therefore, nourishing blood is also necessary. Although acute fright is associated with the liver and heart, if wood and fire are strong, the lung metal will be impaired and unable to control wood, which harms the earth element. Hence, it is also essential to nourish the spleen. Furthermore, the medications for treating fright generally focus on dispelling wind, transforming phlegm, and aggressively lowering fire, with strong scents of musk that easily consume yin blood and harm the spleen and stomach. Therefore, for the treatment of excess acute fright, it is crucial to first lower fire and resolve phlegm; after one or two doses, add blood-nourishing and calming medications. If there is decreased appetite, loose stools, or vomiting and diarrhea, supplementary treatment of the spleen and stomach should be included. If there is an original deficiency of the spleen and stomach, then in the purgative medicine, add spleen tonics.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>If one frequently takes purgative and anti-epileptic medications, it is advisable to recognize this as a deficiency of the spleen and scattered blood. For treating epilepsy, one should add tonifying blood and spleen medications and avoid warm or hot herbs like cloves, for fear they may aid stomach heat. It is better to use ginseng, atractylodes, and peony to replenish the spleen&#39;s qi and blood, while using ophiopogon and coptis to clear the metal&#39;s grasp on wood. </p>
<p>In the case of symptoms related to wind-heat in the liver channel, such as convulsions, eye twitching, tense muscles, and excessive phlegm, one may use the Four Substance Decoction to generate liver blood, alongside the hook of the fishing vine to clear heat from sweat, and then add the Four Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen&#39;s earth. If the liver channel&#39;s blood is dry and heated, leading to fear and convulsions with involuntary eye movements and excessive phlegm, one should use the Six-Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water and generate liver blood, along with the Four Gentlemen Decoction plus peony to support the spleen&#39;s earth and generate lung metal.</p>
<p>If lung metal is overpowering liver wood, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used to strengthen spleen earth, along with peony and sand to balance lung metal. Should one frequently take purgative and anti-epileptic medications while having a cold deficiency in the spleen and stomach, one must use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen and stomach, along with sand and cloves to bolster yang qi. If the spleen earth is deficient and cold kidney water encroaches on it, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor appetite, the Beneficial Yellow Powder should be used to strengthen spleen earth while dispelling cold water, thereby hopefully preventing chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Treatment should be based on a careful examination of deficiency and excess. Symptoms indicating excess relate to pathogenic qi, while those indicating deficiency involve original qi. Thus, what is in excess should be regarded as deficient. By considering potential problems and prevention, one can minimize mistakes.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Excitement and Chronic Excitement</strong></p>
<p>Sudden excitement frequently occurs and frequently requires treatment. When using purgative medicines in excess, it depletes the spleen and consumes the yin, transforming it into chronic excitement. One should primarily tonify the spleen and nourish the blood, supplemented with calming agents to clear the lungs and regulate the liver. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The prior symptoms often arise from vomiting and purging, leading to weakness in the spleen and stomach, with the liver wood overpowering them, or due to the kidney water counteracting the earth. Thus, it appears to convulse without truly convulsing, and one may first use the Diaoteng Decoction. If the spasms lessen slightly, then use the Baojian Tianma Powder. If there are vomiting and lack of appetite, urgently apply the Muxiang Yigong Powder to strengthen the spleen and earth, and the illness will resolve. If it does not respond, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additional Muxiang and toasted ginger to warm and tonify the spleen. If there is still no response, urgently add Fuzi to revive the yang. </p>
<p>Chronic excitement symptoms are characterized by external heat and internal true cold; there is no wind to dispel, no phlegm to expel, but one must prioritize warming and tonifying the spleen and stomach. Generally, convulsions caused by wind exhibit a bluish face, red complexion, and cries of distress; if due to fright, there are shouts and convulsions; if caused by food, there is belching, vomiting, and feelings of oppression. Weakness in the lungs and spleen produces sticky phlegm, causing a sawing sound in the throat. This occurs because the heart fire cannot settle the spleen earth, and the spleen earth cannot support the lung metal, leading to the lungs being unable to control qi and the spleen unable to retain saliva, thus causing saliva and gas to rise. </p>
<p>If one uses medicines to dispel wind, transform phlegm, and regulate qi, it will scatter the qi, deplete the yin, and hasten the danger.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Shock and Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>In cases of a child experiencing shock and convulsions, there must be phlegm involved, either due to shock causing phlegm accumulation or due to phlegm leading to shock. In ancient methods for treating shock, phlegm-relieving medicines are always included; it is essential to address the phlegm first before resolving heat and calming the spirit. If phlegm obstructs the chest and diaphragm, then remedies for clearing heat and calming the spirit will have no effect. For heavy phlegm, use Erchen Decoction with bamboo juice and a small amount of ginger juice for the best stability. For heavy phlegm, use Rolling Phlegm Pills or Bai Bingzi for relieving shock to expel it. Rolling Phlegm Pills eliminate heat phlegm, while Bai Bingzi and the Relieving Shock Pills help expel phlegm accumulation. If phlegm is obstructing the upper body, it should be expelled; if severe, use medication to induce vomiting; if mild, self-induced vomiting may suffice. If vomiting is not necessary, focus on Erchen Decoction as the primary remedy. For cases of spleen deficiency with heat phlegm, add Baizhu, Qinjian, and Lian; for phlegm due to wind, add Nanshing, Beimu, and Zhisun; for stomach deficiency causing phlegm, add Baizhu, malt, and bamboo juice.<br><strong>Note:</strong> If the previous symptoms are due to the heart and liver meridians with excessive wind-heat, showing symptoms like tightly closed eyes and limb convulsions, the liver should be treated to clear the heart. If due to heat retention in the heart meridian, with shouting and trembling, it is advisable to clear heat and calm the spirit. If caused by lung wind-cold invasion, with symptoms like shortness of breath and wheezing, treat phlegm and regulate the lungs. If due to dietary disturbances with vomiting and drowsiness, digestion and strengthening the spleen should be the focus.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>If the weakness of the spleen and lungs leads to an abundance of wind and phlegm, resulting in the previous symptoms, the main approach should be to tonify the middle and enhance the qi. If one insists on using medications to dispel wind, treat phlegm, or regulate qi, then the qi will disperse, the yin will diminish, and this will hasten the danger.</p>
<p>If a child suddenly shows signs of shock, with upward gaze, head shaking, and teeth grinding, the symptoms appear strange. Many in society attribute this to an excess of the liver&#39;s meridian and administer calming medications. However, could it not also be due to dietary stagnation, accumulation of phlegm, and excessive fluids, which resemble shock symptoms? It is essential to investigate whether there are any blockages causing abdominal pain and chest fullness, and if there is vomiting and aversion to food. If mild, one can resolve stagnation and transform phlegm; if severe, one should induce vomiting to remove the accumulated stagnation before proceeding with treatment.</p>
<p>There are also cases where fever arises from a cold combined with vomiting and diarrhea, where the deficiency of qi and blood is forced into a state of heat. Although signs of shock are observed, one should not immediately administer calming medications but instead treat the vomiting, diarrhea, and cold. This will stabilize the qi, reduce the heat, and eliminate the shock.</p>
<p>(Note: If the prior symptoms are due to the liver&#39;s wood overwhelming the spleen&#39;s earth, one can use Six Gentlemen Decoction with peony, agarwood, and bupleurum. If due to the spleen’s deficiency, one should use the Five-Flavored Unique Efficacy Powder. In general, stagnation of food and piling up of phlegm leading to shock symptoms result from the weakness of the spleen&#39;s earth, which cannot transform and transport. Thus, by strengthening the spleen and stomach, food will naturally digest, and phlegm will disperse. If calming or wind-dispelling medications are used lightly, they may actually exacerbate the wind and worsen the condition. Moreover, how could tender and delicate organs endure harsh medications? To treat only the symptoms would be a mistake.)<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Medication for children should not be harsh or severe.</p>
<p>The medicines for children&#39;s convulsions are usually small pills or powders, often harsh and severe, chosen for their high efficacy. While effective for conditions related to excess in the liver and heart, they should not be used continuously, especially for moderate illnesses, where one should promptly stop. For mild conditions, it is advisable to use gentle doses; when the illness improves, one should focus on harmonizing and regulating. </p>
<p>For instance, medicines like Niuhuang Wan contain many ingredients, often chaotic and excessive. Liangjing Wan should not be given unless there is strong liver fire. Baolong Wan frequently shows little effect; moreover, its ingredients like musk and borneol are too pungent, dispersing true vital energy and damaging the spleen and stomach, leading to a deficiency of original qi, which may cause the illness to worsen.</p>
<p>[Note: In pediatric conditions, &quot;excess&quot; pertains to the liver channel, while &quot;deficiency&quot; relates to the spleen channel. Excess refers to pathogenic qi, while deficiency refers to original qi. In cases of excess pathogenic qi and deficiency of original qi, one should supplement rather than purge, especially since delicate organs in children cannot tolerate harsh medicines. The previous discussions on convulsion hold profound meaning!]<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>After being startled, the eyes move slightly and the teeth clench. This indicates liver deficiency, with deficiency accompanied by heat. The deficiency suggests insufficient blood, while the heat indicates excess energy. When water is insufficient, it cannot contain fire, causing it to flare up. The gums belong to the stomach and spleen; when the stomach is deficient and there is heat, slight clenching can also be observed. One should not attribute this solely to liver and kidney issues but should focus on nourishing the spleen, adding Huang Lian, Shao Yao, and Chuan Xiong to drain liver qi and nourish liver blood. Sheng Di Huang cools the heart’s blood, thus the Dao Chi San should be used. Shu Di Huang nourishes kidney blood, hence the Di Huang Wan is appropriate. For any cases of liver and kidney deficiency, one can add Di Huang to spleen and stomach remedies. If one attributes eye clenching and teeth grinding solely to liver and kidney deficiency and exclusively takes Di Huang Wan, won&#39;t that just lead to phlegm accumulation, obstructing the spleen and stomach?</p>
<p>(Note: It’s noted that previous symptoms may also indicate liver heat generating wind that enters the eyes; this can cause them to strain and become tense under heat. If the face is flushed while lying down, shaking the head, and grinding the teeth, this is caused by heart heat. One must also differentiate between deficiency and excess: if the liver is in excess, use Qing Wan; if deficient, use Di Huang Wan; if the heart is in excess, use Dao Chi San; if deficient, use Fen Hong Wan. If the spleen and stomach are deficient with heat, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Shao Yao and San Zhi to stabilize the spleen earth and control the liver wood. For liver and kidney deficiency heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to replenish kidney water and nourish liver wood.)<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>When a child suffers from convulsions due to smallpox, there is no need to treat the convulsions themselves. If the body is hot but the ears and buttocks are cold, and there&#39;s uncertainty about the condition, one should use the traditional remedy of Shengma Gegeng Decoction. Once the pox has appeared or is fully out, one should regulate the qi and blood according to Danxi&#39;s method for smallpox, assessing the qi and blood for deficiency or excess by examining their color—red, purple, pale, or their density—thick or sparse, and adjusting the medicines according to the seasons, usually focusing on the spleen and stomach. For deficient cold, use Chen Wenxiu&#39;s warming and tonifying method, and for excess heat, use detoxification methods, always adapting flexibly to the situation.</p>
<p>(Note: If smallpox has not yet erupted, one should focus on supplementation; once it has appeared or is complete, one should focus on regulation. It is also essential to observe the color and listen to the sounds to differentiate between excess and deficiency inside and out for appropriate treatment, to avoid mistakes. The common consensus among practitioners emphasizes the teachings of Danxi, Qian, and Chen, and it is necessary to understand and integrate them according to the timely appropriateness, avoiding rigidity in practice.)<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>I respectfully suggest that symptoms such as blackened eyelids, cold ears, clenched teeth, and diarrhea indicate a deficiency of the spleen’s earth element, with cold water retaliating against and oppressing the earth, leading to adverse conditions related to the kidneys. To treat this, one should use Baixiang Wan to purge it, and urgently apply the Four Gentlemen, clove, dried tangerine peel, magnolia, thick-skinned and roasted ginger to warm and nourish the spleen’s earth. When the body feels hot, drinking water may cause the blackened symptoms to recur, making recovery difficult. This occurs because of the spleen’s deficiency, and cold water invading it. Thus, Mr. Chen Wenxiu says: if one treats cold water after it has invaded, why not protect the spleen’s earth before it becomes deficient? This reveals what was not previously acknowledged, saving future generations from error. Moreover, when smallpox erupts, forming pus and scars, it indicates the emergence of boils, decaying and regenerating flesh, all resulting from the spleen’s original qi. If one has blackened symptoms, chills, clenched teeth, diarrhea, and breathing issues, this indicates the yang qi of the boils has been lost and cold qi has invaded, representing a yin condition. One should urgently use Yigong Powder, increasing the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, ginger, and ashwagandha to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach. One must not be rigid in timing for detoxification and purging methods. Instead, when weakness appears, it is appropriate to nourish the spleen and stomach to recover the scars. Observing how Mr. Danxi treated an elderly man with fever and fatigue, whose pulse was large and somewhat rapid, he treated him with twenty doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, and major ingredients of dried tangerine peel, leading to the emergence of smallpox; after another twenty doses, the pustules formed, with skin remaining intact; and after sixty doses, he stabilized, revealing the principle behind the treatment.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Errors in Medication for Symptoms of Shock and Convulsion</strong></p>
<p>Children may experience shock or convulsions, may have changes in their conditions, suffer from food accumulation, or experience alternating cold and heat. If they mistakenly take medicines that relieve exterior conditions or clear heat, it can damage the spleen and stomach, making it difficult to generate qi and blood. This leads to a pale complexion, emaciated body, trembling eyes, grinding teeth, thin hair, weak limbs, and an inability to walk. This condition results from spleen deficiency, not liver or kidney issues. It requires gradual nurturing and regulation to restore the stomach&#39;s qi.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Medicinal substances that are overly potent are not suitable for the spleen and stomach, especially in children. Many ailments arise from improper dairy and food intake, imbalances in cold and warmth, which weaken the spleen and stomach, disrupting the foundation of vital energy, allowing pathogens to invade. Some issues may also stem from the nurse&#39;s physiological imbalances or emotional distress, as well as irregularities in diet and lifestyle. If one does not discern the fundamental causes and the urgency of the condition but mistakenly administers harsh medicines, severely harming the life-giving qi of the spleen and stomach, it can lead to various transformations of the disease and hasten death. Whose fault is it? Master Danxi&#39;s compassionate discourse on the care of infants discusses this matter in detail.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Summary of Caring for Infants</strong><br><strong>By Xue Kai (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liver</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang says: The liver governs wind. When it is in excess, there will be shouting with wide eyes, a stiff neck, and sudden oppression; when it is deficient, there will be teeth grinding and yawning. When heat rises, it causes exterior wind; when the air is warm, it generates internal wind, which can be dispersed with Da Qing Gao powder. If the patient can eat, continue to drink water, and use Da Huang Wan to induce slight purging. If the liver is heated, the eyes won’t twitch, and the hands will seek the collar or fidget with objects. Use Xie Qing Wan to treat it. High heat calls for water to relieve wheezing and suffocation, treated with Xie Bai San. Liver conditions manifest in fall; if the lung is weak and unable to overcome the liver, use Yi Huang San to tonify the spleen and Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver. If wind affects the liver, the eyes will blink repeatedly, and if the heart is hot, there will be twitching; treat the liver with Xie Qing Wan and the heart with Dao Chi San. In severe cases, the body may arch backward, the eyes will not twitch, and the heart won’t bear heat; use Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys and Xie Qing Wan for the liver. Those with pale lips should not be treated. Zhang Jiegu also states: The liver governs wind—when afflicted, there will be wind twitching and tightness. If the heart takes advantage of the liver due to excess, the lung takes advantage as a thief, and the kidney takes advantage as a deficiency. Whenever the liver is sick, one must first examine the lungs and kidneys; the kidneys are the mother of the liver, and the lungs are the thief of the liver. Therefore, if the liver is ill, if it is not due to kidney water failing to support it, it is likely due to the lung metal’s ghostly influence. Thus, if the cause lies in the lungs, first treat the lungs to expel the ghost. If the cause is in the kidneys, first nourish the kidneys to rejuvenate the source. Then carefully assess the condition of the main organ regarding deficiency and excess, cold and warmth.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>I suspect that if the previous symptoms indicate true heat in the liver channel with external wind, it is appropriate to use Da Qing Gao San. If, after taking the medicine, the previous symptoms persist or worsen, this indicates that the evil qi has departed but the spleen energy is deficient; it is advisable to use Yi Gong San with added Chuanxiong and Angelica. If there is虚 heat in the liver channel, possibly arising from internal wind due to repression, one should use Yi Gong San combined with Di Huang Wan to nourish. If the wind evil enters the organs, causing difficulties in eating and drinking cold items, along with constipation, this indicates that the evil qi is an internal excess; it is appropriate to use Da Huang Wan to purge it. If, after purging, one has little appetite for food and soup, or experiences abdominal bloating, this signifies internal deficiency of the spleen; it is advisable to use Bai Zhu San for nourishment. If the qi and blood are inherently weak, perhaps due to a previous illness or the use of purgative treatments, and there are signs like hand fumbling with collars, grinding teeth, yawning, and pale bluish eyes, this indicates severe deficiency of the liver channel; urgently use Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys and liver. Symptoms like difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, and irregular breathing indicate severe deficiency in the lung channel; swiftly use Yi Gong San to nourish the spleen and lungs. If, during the late afternoon hours (Shen and You), there are cries, fixed gazes, excessive yawning, restlessness, rapid heartbeat, and hand and foot tremors with fever and thirst, this indicates a clash of wind and fire overcoming the lung metal; use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to treat liver fire and promote liver blood, along with Yi Gong San to nourish the spleen soil to generate lung metal. If the lips appear pale, this indicates critical deficiency of the spleen with no cure. The ailments of infants and young children often arise from the heavy flavors and emotions during pregnancy, or from improper breastfeeding, or from the dietary distress and anger of the nursing mother. When the pathogenic qi manifests and the child’s energy is already weak, one should investigate the causes and use medicine, adding Liu Lu to treat the mother, while the child takes one or two spoonfuls. Proceed with this method afterwards.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Heart</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: The heart governs fright; in truth, it manifests as crying and heat, with convulsions after drinking water. When deficient, it leads to fatigue and a restless state. He also mentions: When there is heat, the breath in sleep is warm, and there may be teeth grinding with a sense of cold while lying face up, indicating heart heat, which can be treated with Daohong San. If one lies on their back, it indicates a full-heartedness, where the energy cannot circulate up and down; in this case, Xiexin San should be used. Heart issues seen in winter indicate fire dominating water, therefore one should tonify the kidney and treat the heart. In mild cases, the ailment may resolve on its own. If there is a descent without speech, this signifies kidney deficiency and fear. Zhang Jiego further states: The heart governs heat; if the lung invades the heart it is a minor pathogen, if the liver invades the heart it is a deficiency pathogen, if the spleen invades the heart it is a real pathogen, and if the kidney invades the heart it is a treacherous pathogen. Whenever the heart is afflicted, one must first consider the liver and kidneys. When liver energy flows freely, heart energy harmonizes; when liver energy is stagnant, heart energy becomes deficient. Hence for heart issues, one should first seek the liver to clear its source.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>When the internal organs are afflicted, the disease will inevitably affect the organ that is conquered. The evil affecting the kidneys will inevitably transmit to the heart; thus, one must first treat the kidneys and eliminate the evil. If the pulses of the liver and kidneys are harmonious, then one should assess the heart&#39;s condition, whether it is deficient or excess, and treat accordingly. I believe those who lie on their backs do so because their chest is full of heat, hence they prefer to face upwards and seek emptiness. Those who lie on their sides do so because their chest is deficient and heated, thus they prefer to lie in a contracted position and seek fullness. In cases of fullness, one should harmonize and treat the heart and liver; in cases of deficiency, one should tonify the spleen and lungs, distinguishing between the two and observing their respective conditions. Symptoms such as jaw clenching may exhibit similarities and do not require rigid adherence. For example, even if the evil is expelled using remedies such as Xie Xin and Dao Chi, the disease may still persist, necessitating the tonification of the original qi; or it may worsen, requiring urgent warming and tonification of the original qi. If the heart qi appears in winter, during the hours of the Pig or Rat, the illness can worsen or present as silent descent, indicating deficiency of kidney water and excess heat of the heart, thus one should use Di Huang Wan. Infants with breast milk must have their mothers take this remedy.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>            Spasms</p>
<p>During the hours of Yin and Mao (1-3 am) and Chen (7-9 am), spasms with fever occur, accompanied by thirst and a desire for cold drinks, leading to constipation. This is attributed to deficiency heat in the liver and gallbladder meridians, and should be treated with Chai Shao Shen Ling San. If there is thirst with a tendency to drink, spontaneous sweating, and night sweats, this indicates blood deficiency in the liver and gallbladder meridians, and can be treated with Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>If there is salivation and a sticky mouth, this indicates the liver wood overpowering the spleen earth, and can be treated with Liu Jun Zi Tang. </p>
<p>During the hours of Si, Wu, and Wei (9 am - 3 pm), if there are spasms along with thirst for water, this indicates a battle between wind and fire. In this case, Di Huang Wan can be used to tonify the liver, while Dao Chi San and Liang Jing Wan can treat the heart. If the thirst is for soup, accompanied by fatigue and a lack of milk, this indicates earth deficiency and wood excess, and Di Huang Wan should be used to tonify the kidneys, along with Liu Jun Zi to strengthen the spleen. </p>
<p>During the hours of Shen, You, and Xu (3-9 pm), if there are mild spasms with shortness of breath, slight eye deviation, a feeling of heating while sleeping with eyes exposed, and light yellow stools, this indicates deficiency heat in the spleen and lungs, and can be treated with Yi Gong San. </p>
<p>If the hands and feet are cold, or if the patient has shortness of breath and diarrhea without appetite, this indicates deficiency cold in the spleen and lungs, and can be treated with Liu Jun Zi, Pao Jiang, and Mu Xiang. In cases of prolonged illness with deficiency of vital energy, Liu Jun Zi and Liu Wei Wan can both be used as the primary treatment.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>At the hours of the pig, rat, and ox, if there are slight convulsions, body heat, eyes tightly slanted, vomiting and diarrhea without nursing, cold extremities, and excessive sleep, this indicates a cold-water affliction humiliating the earth element; one should use Yao Huang San. If this does not help, use Liu Jun Zi, ginger, and cinnamon. If convulsions are caused by wind, with breath not hot and limbs fatigued, use Yi Gong San to tonify the earth element of the spleen and Diao Teng Decoction to clear the liver. If there are internal symptoms resulting from wind evil causing fever and various conditions, one should treat the lung metal to clear the wind evil. If the external evil has been resolved but internal symptoms persist, tonify the lung and spleen. If the lung meridian is deficient leading to convulsions, one should tonify the spleen and lung to balance the liver and heart, at which point the convulsions will cease. If convulsions arise from stagnant food, accompanied by vomiting of milk or food, one should use Xiao Shi Wan. If digestion has taken place but earlier symptoms persist or have changed to other symptoms, this indicates damage to the spleen earth with the liver wood taking over, and one should use Liu Jun Zi with Diao Teng to strengthen the spleen and balance the liver. If there are convulsions within a hundred days, due to the influence of fetal energy or the mother’s excessive rich tastes, treatment must include the mother, prioritizing the strengthening of her stomach, and one must not treat the child directly.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Shock Seizures</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang says: When a child has seizures, it may be due to insufficient blood and energy, a lack of spirit, or harm from wind pathogens, or being startled by strange occurrences. It can also result from fright during pregnancy. If the eyes are straight and drawn, the mouth is locked with saliva flowing, the belly is distended and hands twitch, the back is arched, the spine is stiff, and the body appears as if dead, remaining unconscious all day, this is called &quot;apoplexy&quot;. If the face is flushed, the eyes bulge, the tongue is out and lips bitten, the heart is restless and breath short, and the voice resembles that of a sheep, this is called &quot;heart seizure&quot;. If the face is green, lips are blue, eyes roll upward, hands and feet convulse and bend backwards, and the voice resembles that of a dog, this is called &quot;liver seizure&quot;. If the face is dark, eyes tremble, saliva is foamed, the body appears like a corpse, and the voice resembles that of a pig, this is called &quot;kidney seizure&quot;. If the face is like a withered bone, the eyes are white and looking back, startled jumps and bent limbs occur, with head shaking and foaming at the mouth, and the voice resembles that of a chicken, this is called &quot;lung seizure&quot;. If the complexion is pale yellow, eyes are straight, abdomen is distended with diarrhea, and limbs are unresponsive, with a voice resembling that of a cow, this is called &quot;spleen seizure&quot;. The five seizures are treated with the Five Color Pills as the main remedy, along with additional medicine from various meridians. Heart seizure pertains to blood; for deficiency, use Nourishing Heart Decoction; for real heat due to drinking cold with fever, use Tiger Eye Pills; for false heat from drinking broth with fever, use Myriad Fragrance Powder.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>For those with liver convulsions, use Dihuang Pills for deficiency syndrome; if there are strong convulsions, use Chaihu Qinggan Powder for excess pathogens; if there&#39;s constipation, use Xieqing Pills. For kidney convulsions, use Dihuang Pills or similar kinds like Ziheche Pills. There is no purging method for the kidney, so treatment should focus on deficiency. For lung convulsions, associated with qi deficiency, use Bup肺散; if the complexion is pale yellow, indicating that the earth cannot generate, use Wuwei Yigong Powder; if the complexion is red, suggesting that yin fire is rising to the lung, use Dihuang Pills. For spleen convulsions, use Wuwei Yigong Powder; if the complexion is bluish and there are loose bowels, with little appetite, use Liu Junzi Decoction added with Mu Xiang and Chaihu. If there is fever with twitching while lying on the back, the complexion is bright, and the pulse is superficial, indicating that the illness is in the yang organ and is easier to treat. If the body is cold with no convulsions, lying face down, the complexion is dark, and the pulse is deep, the illness is in the yin organ and is harder to treat. In general, if these symptoms are present, first examine the area between the high bones behind the ears; if there are blue vein markings, breaking it open to let it bleed may alleviate the affliction. These symptoms all indicate insufficient vital energy, so Ziheche Pills should be the main treatment, supplemented with tonics. If there is indiscriminate harm that further injures vital energy, it could lead to recurring attacks and increase danger over time, potentially resulting in a condition that can&#39;t be saved. There are also three types of convulsions caused by fright and food, which should be referred to in subsequent prescriptions, treating them similarly to fright and fetal fright.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Shock</strong></p>
<p>Sudden shock is a Yang condition, where all the internal organs are affected and associated with heat, leading to excess of Shaoyang fire. The classic text states: when there is heat, it generates wind; wind generates phlegm. When phlegm heat resides in the heart and diaphragm, it causes a clash between wind and fire, resulting in convulsions. The text describes that excessive wood leads to this phenomenon, and its movements manifest as dizziness and sudden illness. </p>
<p>It is advisable to use medications such as Lijing Pills, Daohong Powder, and Qingxiao Pills, along with calming agents to stop the convulsions and stabilize the spirit. Lou Quanshan also states: sudden shock belongs to wood, fire, and solid earth. When wood is in excess, it leads to convulsions that are vigorous, along with upward eye movements and frequent blinking; when earth is solid, it results in body heat and a red face without vomiting or diarrhea, often leading to drowsiness and eyes closed. </p>
<p>The treatment principle should be to cool and drain, using calming shock and Lijing pills. Some may experience shock due to tight jaw, severe heat with salivation, unnatural gaze, convulsions, and trembling lips, marked by rapid and tense pulse, red cheeks and lips, with constipation. This indicates internal heat with external wind evil, requiring interruption of wind and stabilization of convulsions. If phlegm heat persists, it should still be lightly purged. After the phlegm heat is drained, it’s urgent to nourish the stomach qi; if convulsions stabilize and phlegm heat decreases, then one should supplement the spleen qi. Dongyuan notes: if the shock comes from external stimuli, Huanglian Anshen Pills are recommended; if the shock is initiated by emotional disturbance, calming pills like Anshen Zhengjing Pills are appropriate, while avoiding Fangfeng Pills. If shock leads to greenish diarrhea, Zhusha Pills are suitable, while cooling shock pills should be avoided.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>Indeed, those who are suddenly startled have an excess of wind and wood. The wind and wood are associated with the liver; when they are abundant, they must transmit their effects to the spleen. To treat the liver, one must first tonify the spleen, and then drain the excess wind and wood. If one uses Yao Huang San, it would be a mistake. The classics say: when pathogenic Qi is strong, it is full; when the righteous Qi is depleted, it is vacuous. The fullness mentioned earlier refers to an excess of pathogenic Qi while the form (or vitality) is lacking. Hence, one should first drain and then tonify. If there is severe vacuity, one should prioritize tonifying the spleen, using mild herbs to attack the pathogens. The vacuity referred to here means both pathogenic Qi and vitality are insufficient, and thus one should focus on purely tonifying the true Qi.</p>
<p>If wind and fire conflict in the liver, causing twitching or eye movement and an excess of phlegm, one should use Si Wu Tang to nourish liver blood, adding Diaoteng and Shan Zhi to clear liver fire, and additionally use Si Jun Zi to tonify the spleen, and Liu Wei Wan to nourish the kidneys. If the lung metal overcomes wood and there are signs of yawning, use Xie Bai San to drain lung pathogens and Di Huang Wan to enrich liver blood. If the pathogen enters the liver, one can use Chai Hu Qing Gan San with added Long Dan Cao. If it enters the heart, use Zhi Zi Qing Gan San with added fried Huang Lian. If it enters the kidneys, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If it enters the lungs, use Di Gu Pi San. If it enters the spleen, use Liu Jun Zi with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi added. This condition is associated with liver and gallbladder blood deficiency, where wind and fire are in conflict, and change is often observed. </p>
<p>If one does not nourish liver blood and does not tonify spleen Qi, but only uses herbs to expel wind and transform phlegm, the spleen will become more vacuous, blood will be further depleted, and the pathogenic Qi will linger, inevitably leading to chronic distress.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>Slow shock refers to a condition involving yin, where both the internal organs are affected by illness leading to deficiency. Due to vomiting and diarrhea, both the spleen and lungs are deficient, allowing the liver&#39;s wood element to invade, resulting in symptoms like spasms and convulsions. As Lou Quanshan stated, &quot;When wood is deficient, there are spasms and weakness,&quot; and the classics say, &quot;When wood is insufficient, it indicates imbalance.&quot; The symptom of head shaking corresponds to this. [Referring to spasms of the hands and feet, diarrhea, and palpitations.] When fire is deficient, the body feels cold and there is a cool sensation in the mouth; when earth is deficient, there is vomiting and diarrhea, and the eyes remain open during sleep. Treatment should focus on warming and nourishing the spleen and stomach, using formulas such as Six Gentlemen Decoction and Five Flavor Unique Function Powder. Xu Yongcheng notes: &quot;Wood belongs to yin, and thus liver diseases are slow and difficult to treat. Additionally, if there are mixed heat, food accumulation, and phlegm, resembling exterior patterns, one should adhere to the prescriptions of the Qian family.&quot; The &quot;Baoying Ji&quot; states: &quot;If acute shock frequently occurs and laxatives are repeatedly used, the yin of the spleen will further deplete, transforming into slow shock.&quot; Generally, symptoms include vomiting, phlegm sounds, wheezing, eyes open with a languid spirit, drowsiness with eyes exposed, spasms and convulsions, sudden onset then calm, possibly fluctuating body temperature, pale complexion, or bluish-red lips and eyebrows. The pulse tends to be slow, deep, and weak. The primary treatment should warm and nourish the spleen qi, supplemented by calming and restraining the liver. Dongyuan also states: &quot;Slow shock wind arises from the deficiency of the spleen and stomach.&quot;<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>Those with a deficiency of the spleen are affected by fire evils that invade its domain. When fire is strong, it can solidify the wood, and when wood is thriving, it attacks the earth. Therefore, in the heart&#39;s center, one should use sweet and warm substances to nourish the source of the earth, while also using sweet and cold remedies to reduce the fire in the spleen and supplement metal with sour and cool elements, leading to a situation where metal thrives and fire diminishes in the spleen, rendering the wind and wood weak. This condition often arises from inadequate constitution, prolonged illness of spleen deficiency, or the frequent use of harmful medications. </p>
<p>If the deficiency of the earth prevents the generation of metal, and metal cannot stabilize wood, causing wood to dishonor the earth, one should use a formula with five distinct flavors and add Angelica and sour jujube seed, complemented by a decoction of Uncaria to nourish the earth and stabilize the wood. If there is cold and deficiency in the spleen, one should administer the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger and cardamom; if that does not work, urgently add Aconite to restore yang energy. </p>
<p>It is important to note that yin blood originates from the earth of the spleen, thus the Four Gentlemen Decoction combined with Angelica and sour jujube seed is suitable. If the primal energy is depleted and leads to confusion, one should promptly moxibust the Baihui point. If one waits until phlegm is persistent before applying moxibustion, the primal energy may disperse beyond recovery. </p>
<p>This reflects the extreme transformation of the internal organs, ultimately leading to deficiency, with the spleen being primarily affected. There is no wind to chase away, nor is there fright that can be treated. The spleen&#39;s inability to control saliva results in the fluid becoming capricious and resembling phlegm; one should follow the previous methods to treat it effectively. If the underlying cause is not addressed and indiscriminate usage of remedies to eliminate wind and resolve phlegm is applied, the spleen&#39;s energy will be further harmed, yin blood will be increasingly depleted, and the pathogenic factors will escalate, resulting in greater danger.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>When a child suddenly exhibits symptoms of astonishment, with eyes wide open and rigid, it is often due to wind-heat affecting the liver. If there is liver deficiency leading to wind, the eyes will not be wide open or rigid, and there may be frequent jaw clenching. If there is an excess of wind in the liver channels, the eyes will be wide open, accompanied by loud cries, yawning, a tense neck, and feelings of oppression. If there is heat in the liver channels, the eyes may be wide open and not rigid, but rigidity can arise from internal heat or external heat, and warmth may manifest internally. Symptoms include reaching for clothes or fidgeting with objects. In this case, it is advisable to use Xieqing Pills. For intense heat causing coughing and tightness, Xie Bai Powder is recommended. Regardless of whether the illness is new or longstanding, it can provoke liver wind. When wind moves internally, it rises to the eyes, causing them to become wide open; if heat affects the eyes and pulls the tendons and veins, both corners of the eyes become tight, preventing them from turning, hence the rigidity of the eyes.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>There are also cases where food stagnation in the middle burner leads to the failure of clear yang to rise and turbid yin to descend, causing the energy of the liver wood to be unable to ascend, which results in the appearance of ineffective wind. This must be examined carefully. If there is fullness in the chest and pain in the abdomen, along with vomiting and aversion to food, mild cases should be treated with methods to digest and resolve phlegm, while severe cases require exploration and purging of stagnant accumulation. One must also investigate whether the cause is due to cold or hot substances. There are instances of catching a cold leading to vomiting and diarrhea, which causes earth to weaken and wood to insult, resulting in ineffective wind. One should not hastily use calming medications but should instead opt for the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Peony, Wood Fragrance, and Bupleurum to nourish the liver and tonify the spleen. If the condition is due to deficiency of the spleen and resulting illness, Five Flavors Decoction should be used. In cases of food stagnation and the presence of phlegm and dampness leading to symptoms of agitation, it is truly due to the weakness of the spleen-earth, which fails to generate metal. If metal is deficient, it cannot pacify wood, and thus wood is allowed to go awry. It is advisable to strengthen the spleen and digest food, and the symptoms will resolve on their own. If one rashly uses medications for agitation, it may worsen the wind and exacerbate the condition. Moreover, since the internal organs are delicate, harsh treatments should not be administered; practitioners should be cautious!<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>When a child shows slight eye movement and grinds their teeth after being startled, it is indicative of a condition in which the body has lost fluids after an illness, unable to nourish their tendons and meridians. There may also be a deficiency of liver qi with internal heat leading to wind; one should carefully assess their qi and blood for excess or deficiency and treat accordingly. If there’s daytime fever with movement after drinking cold beverages, it indicates an excess of qi; in this case, administer the Qingsuan Pills. If there’s night sweats and restless sleep with movement, it signifies a deficiency of blood; use the Rehmannia Pills. Sometimes, manifestations of wind in the liver channel may affect the spleen and kidneys, also causing teeth grinding; start with the Chaihu Qinggan Powder, followed by the Five-Flavor Chengqi Powder and the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills. If the condition is due to deficiency-heat in the spleen and stomach, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added peony and gardenia. If there’s true excess heat, use the Xie Huang Powder, considering that the gums belong to the Yangming channels of the hands and feet. In cases of liver and kidney heat, employ the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Disturbance During Sleep</strong></p>
<p>When a child is startled awake in their sleep, it is due to a deficiency in the heart and kidneys. The heart governs blood and spirit, the liver stores blood and the soul, the lungs govern qi and the corporeal soul, and the kidneys govern essence and fear. Children’s organs are fragile and easily disturbed by fright; fear causes qi to descend, and surprise leaves the heart without support and the spirit without a home. The spirit and qi of a person move through the eyes when awake and reside in the kidneys when asleep. If both the heart and kidneys are deficient, they cannot stabilize the spirit, resulting in disturbances during sleep. </p>
<p>Treatment should focus on calming the heart and tranquilizing the spirit, using a formula of Poria heart-replenishing soup, adding sour jujube seed, Poria, and Five Flavor Fruit. In cases where fright causes disturbance due to liver agitation, the soul is unsettled, and treatment should aim to calm fright and stabilize the soul, using tranquilizing pills. If food is interrupted by fright, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Spirit Qu to promote digestion and Hou Po to regulate. If food is digested but fright is still unsettled, use the Poria heart-replenishing soup. If excessive wood and fire make the heart spirit uneasy, use Guide Red Powder. If wind and heat collide, use Chai Hu and Gardenia Powder. If food stagnation produces phlegm and causes unrest, use the Four Gentlemen to strengthen the spleen, Spirit Qu and Ban Xia to transform phlegm, and Gardenia and Peony to clear heat.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Fishing: Internal Fishing</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly fishing refers to a condition where the child looks up in fear, experiencing shock and heat, with eyes bulging and tears welling but not flowing. The limbs twitch, alternating between sorrow and laughter, as if possessed by a ghost. In severe cases, the fingernails may turn blue, caused by the wet and rich diet of the wet nurse, which accumulates toxins in the stomach, leading to heat and phlegm in the child&#39;s heart and lungs. Additionally, external cold evils may also be a problem. The remedy should focus on expelling these evils, using a decoction made from vine (Diao Teng). For those who exhibit coarse breathing, administer the Four Gentleman Decoction with scorpion (Wu Xie).</p>
<p>Internal fishing is characterized by abdominal pain accompanied by shortness of breath, lips turning dark, and bulging cysts. The child may also be hunched over with eyes turned red at the corners, likely due to wind during pregnancy or an external fright. If the internal organs are seizing and causing painful cries, or if there are diarrhea and curled-up legs, both internal and external symptoms will manifest, making treatment very difficult. For internal conditions, use Jubaodan; for external indications, administer the Diao Teng decoction. If breastfeeding, the child may be treated. For abdominal pain with dark lips and cysts, use Jubaodan. For cases of external fright and internal organ spasms, use Diao Teng decoction. If the wet nurse&#39;s excessive consumption of rich food has built up toxins in the stomach, use a modified Clear Stomach Powder. If the nurse’s anger has accumulated heat in the liver, use modified Xiao Yao San or modified Gui Pi Decoction, both with added reed. Both mother and child should take these remedies.</p>
<p>In general, when wet nurses consume rich and fatty foods, when feeding the child, they should first express any stored milk before nursing.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>Shock from Wind</strong></p>
<p>Shock from wind is characterized by a sense of fear, confusion, and a disbanded spirit. Phlegm and saliva come and go, manifesting as a blue complexion and diarrhea. If the shock penetrates the heart, it leads to a red face and night crying; treat with Gardenia powder to clear the liver, combined with Coptis. If it enters the liver, a greenish face and bulging eyes occur; use Chai Hu powder to clear the liver. If it impacts the spleen, it results in a yellow face, vomiting,虚 (exhaustion), and a tendency to sleep; use Six Gentlemen plus Chai Hu and Mountain Gardenia. If it affects the lungs, a pale face and labored breathing appear; employ Yigong powder combined with Chai Hu and Platycodon. If it influences the kidneys, you observe a dark face, grinding teeth, and nursing; use the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill. </p>
<p>This condition may arise from the nurse&#39;s anger, liver fire, or excessive heat passed on from rich foods, or from the child’s vomiting and diarrhea harming the spleen, causing the clear energy to not rise, and wind-wood descending into the Taiyin. All these factors can lead to such a condition, which must be treated according to the underlying cause; otherwise, it will develop into a chronic spleen issue, requiring careful prevention and goodwill.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>Convulsion Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Convulsion syndrome arises from wind injury and excessive sweating, due to improper sweating treatments or excessive sweating from dampness: if there is stiffness in the neck and back, arched back, shaking of the head, inability to speak, fever, and abdominal pain, the disease is in the Foot Taiyin. If the face is red without sweating, feeling cold, jaws tightly clenched, limbs are stiff, phlegm and saliva are abundant, with restlessness and thirst, and reddish, scanty urine, if it starts with delirium, it’s called “hard convulsion” and should be treated with sweating. If the patient has profuse diarrhea, is silent and lacks thirst, has sweating but does not feel cold, and starts with cold hands and feet, it is referred to as “soft convulsion.” This should be treated with a modified version of the “Small Continuation of Life Decoction.” For hard convulsion, remove the aconite and use ephedra, while for soft convulsion, use aconite and omit ephedra. If there is robust heat, delirium, dry mouth, slightly cold hands and feet, and profuse diarrhea, this indicates a combination of hard and soft convulsion; if there is no sweating, use “Kudzu Decoction,” and if there is sweating, use “Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Kudzu.”<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>If phlegm and cold qi are strong, use Nanking prunella, pinellia, and poria to dispel phlegm, and bitter orange, aged tangerine peel, and perilla to regulate qi. If there is mild heat, use Baidu San, and if there is intense heat, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang. If there is strong heat with sweating, fullness in the chest, and clenched teeth indicating internal heat, use Da Cheng Qi Tang to purge it, then follow with Da Chai Hu Tang to resolve it; if more than three days pass, it becomes difficult to treat. These are all methods to treat the six external evils affecting the original qi, addressing both the physical illness and the real condition. For children, it is often due to fright causing food stagnation, or from the wet and dry conditions of the wet nurse being inappropriate, so it’s essential to examine this and also treat the mother. Generally, due to fright causing direct staring and yawning, stiff neck, and irritability, pertaining to real heat in the liver channel, use Yi Gan San. If there is clenching of teeth and yawning with hands seeking the collar, indicating虚 (deficiency) heat in the liver channel, use Di Huang Wan. If the lung&#39;s metal cannot balance wood, use Yi Gong San. If the spleen cannot nourish the liver, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If water cannot generate wood, use Di Huang Wan.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Nosebleeds from Shaking One&#39;s Head</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: All dizziness caused by winds pertains to the wood of the liver. When wood is influenced by wind, it moves, indicating that the fire in the liver channel is strong, giving rise to deficient wind. The physician Tang treated Zheng Du&#39;s assistant, who had been experiencing nosebleeds from shaking his head for seven years, using medicines to dispel wind and stop bleeding, but all trials proved ineffective. This condition was due to wind-heat affecting the liver channel, where the earth is overwhelmed by the wood, failing to contain the blood, which then spills into the large intestine, resulting in persistent nosebleeds. Thus, a formula was devised: Clear the Liver and Nourish the Stomach Decoction, to soothe the liver and benefit the spleen, dispel wind-heat, and concurrently take the Stomach Wind Decoction. After ten days, all symptoms were resolved. The nosebleeds occur because the shaking wind wood disrupts the earth, preventing it from controlling the blood. Overindulgence in sour flavors, believed to nourish the liver, leads to the formation of yin constraints. The classics say: When yin is constrained, it results in blood loss—one liter at first, then two liters in the second constraint, and three liters in the third.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>If there is a deviation in the five organs, then the yin vessels will be out of harmony. When the yin vessels are not in harmony, blood will be retained. The disease of blood retention is due to the internal accumulation of yin energy, which is unable to flow outward, thus seeping into the intestines, resulting in bloody stools. Blood may also be affected by maternal anger, excessive wind-heat, or damage to the spleen by the liver, preventing the ascent of clear energy. Alternatively, if a wind pathogen invades the large intestine. </p>
<p>The treatment methods are as follows: if due to wind-heat, use Chaihu Qinggan San. If due to angry fire, use Jiawei Xiaochaihu Tang. If clear energy does not ascend, and spleen energy is sinking, use Buzhong Yiqi Tang. If the wind pathogen invades the large intestine, use Qinggan Yiwai Wan. If there is excessive heat in the liver channels causing chaos, use Liuwei Dihuang Wan. If the spleen cannot nourish the liver, use Liu Junzi Tang, Chaihu, and Diaoteng Gou. If liver wood overwhelms spleen earth, use Si Junzi Tang, Shaoyao, and Diaoteng Gou. For blood retention, use Pingwei Diyi Tang.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br><strong>A Treatise on Ancient and Modern Medicine</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Cases of Frightful Wind Not Treated</strong></p>
<p>In cases of sudden fright, the eyes roll back, blood comes from the mouth, the legs jump about, and the stomach contracts. Sometimes, the spirit is calm while the body seeks clothing, or the symptoms are severe and the spirit is dulled with difficulty breathing; medicine cannot be swallowed, and there is no sneezing. If there is sudden intense heat and pain in the heart, along with loud cries, it is untreatable. </p>
<p>In cases of gradual fright, the limbs are cold, there may be vomiting, diarrhea, or coughing. The face becomes dark and the spirit grim, there is pain in the stomach, and both conditions result in agitation. If there are white sores in the mouth, the head shakes violently, the eyes do not turn, there is noisy breathing with a swollen throat, and the head feels soft, with inability to control urination or defecation, or if one side of the hands and feet is drawn, it is also untreatable. </p>
<p>In cases of gradual spleen weakness with cold sticky sweat, lying straight like a corpse, wheezing with a soft head, a straight back, clenched mouth shaking, and phlegm sounding like a saw, with pursed lips and coarse breathing, it is untreatable.</p>
<p><strong>The Eight Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When a child has heat, excessive heat produces phlegm, which leads to fright; excessive fright causes convulsions, and vigorous convulsions result in a tight and urgent jaw, thus producing the eight symptoms. These are convulsions, spasms, pulls, tremors, retraction, stretching, darting, and focused gaze. Convulsions involve the hands stretching and contracting, while spasms refer to the fingers opening and closing. Pulling resembles wrestling, tremors cause the head to tilt awkwardly, retraction results in the body leaning backward, stretching has arms like drawn bows, darting has eyes wide with anger, and focused gaze shows lifeless eyes. These are known as the eight symptoms. The four conditions here refer to frightful wind due to phlegm heat. All can be treated with the Wind Transformation Pill.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br><strong>Medical Essentials [Ming - Lou Ying]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sudden Fright</strong></p>
<p>Sudden fright is a yang condition, where the internal organs are affected, and hot phlegm obstructs the heart and lungs, indicating an excess of the lesser yang fire. The classics state that heat generates wind, which can occur from hearing loud noises. This refers to the east&#39;s Zhen hexagram, which embodies the fiery energy leading to convulsions. Fire itself does not move; it requires wind to be stirred. One should use Li Jia Pill, Dao Chi Powder, Xie Qing Pill, and Di Huang Pill. To stop the convulsions, it is advisable to take An Shen Pill.</p>
<p>If sudden fright is accompanied by heat, it can lead to the generation of wind, possibly triggered by shock. Symptoms may include tightness in the upper body, drooling, and heat in both the body and mouth; during the convulsions or upon waking, the person may appear as before, which signifies sudden fright. As the convulsions gradually lessen, one can take calming and heat-clearing herbs, like She Xiang Pill, Zhen Xin Bao Long Pill, Chen Sha Pill, and Zi Xue varieties. Once the convulsions stabilize, one should promptly use medications to eliminate the phlegm and heat, such as Li Jing Pill, Ruan Jin Dan, and Tao Zhi Pill. By effectively dispelling phlegm heat, the heart and spirit will find peace and recovery will occur.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br><strong>Epilepsy and Convulsions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Categories of Sudden Wind Disorder</strong></p>
<p>In children, if there are unexpected twitching of the eyes, it is due to liver wind. If there is unprovoked laughter during the day, the wind is in the heart. If fingers move during dreams, the wind affects the tendons. If fearful of others, it is related to the spleen. If there are involuntary movements of limbs during dreams, the wind affects the liver and heart. If the complexion changes from red to black unexpectedly, the wind is in the kidneys. If there are unprovoked biting, it is the wind in the bones. If one grasps others unexpectedly with limbs, the wind is in the Sanjiao. If the tongue is protruded in dreams, the wind is in the heart. If there is a sensation of pulling in the throat while sleeping, the wind affects the lungs and stomach. If the complexion is pale and there are unexpected fever and shivers, the wind is in the spleen. If there are unprovoked dark facial expressions and terrible screams, the wind is in the kidneys.<br>—Collection of Medical Works, Volume 427<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br><strong>Children&#39;s Convulsions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang]</p>
<p><strong>Liver</strong></p>
<p>Liver disease is characterized by crying, shouting, direct gaze, yawning, irritability, and a tight neck. When wind invades externally, it leads to irritability and a feeling of heat in the mouth, necessitating dispersion, best treated with Da Qing Gao (Great Blue Ointment). Whether the condition is acute or chronic, all involve liver wind. When the wind ascends to the head and eyes, as the eyes pertain to the liver, the wind&#39;s movement is erratic, causing the child to be unable to control their gaze, leading to a straight look. If heat enters the eyes, it pulls on the tendons and veins, causing both corners to tighten, preventing eye movement, hence the fixed gaze. If there is concurrent wind and heat, it leads to spasms, as both the mother and child have real heat that clashes together with wind and fire. </p>
<p>Jie Gu said: The liver governs strategizing and bravery. When there is heat, one seeks clothing or fiddles with objects; the fixed and straight gaze with inability to turn, or in extreme cases, rigidity of the body—these are all signs of wind and heat. The eyes are the orifice of the liver, belonging to wood, which is by nature hasty, hence the symptoms. </p>
<p><strong>Liver diseases are observed in autumn</strong> [alternative: during the late afternoon]. The liver is stronger than the lungs, and if the lungs are weak and cannot overcome the liver, one must tonify the spleen and lungs. Treating the liver by benefiting the spleen is essential because the mother (spleen) supports the child (liver).<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>To tonify the spleen, use the Yi Huang Powder; to treat the liver, the Xie Qing Pill is indicated. </p>
<p>Liver diseases are seen in spring; [some say in the morning], when the lungs dominate the liver, one should tonify the kidneys and liver while treating the lungs. If the liver is timid, it suffers from illness. To replenish the liver and kidneys, use the Di Huang Pill; to treat the lungs, the Xie Bai Powder is indicated. </p>
<p>With the five organs interacting, when encountering light to severe liver diseases, in autumn, when wood (the liver) flourishes, the liver dominates the lungs, thus it is appropriate to tonify the lungs and drain the liver. In mild cases, liver disease recedes; in severe cases, lips turn pale and death occurs.</p>
<p>Loushi said: The five extremes interact; diseases follow the seasons. This is what Qian&#39;s expansion on the theory of organs and energies in the Inner Canon illustrates, revealing insights not previously articulated. If liver disease appears in spring or early morning, it indicates the liver&#39;s inherent condition. Now, if it appears in autumn or at dusk, it relates to the lungs. Knowing the lungs are severely deficient, the liver then overcomes them; thus, tonifying the spleen and lung while draining the liver is appropriate. I follow this principle.</p>
<p>Jie Gu said: The liver governs wind; when it is diseased, wind causes twitching and constriction. Quickly consume sweet foods to alleviate it, assisted by sour and bitter to disperse the wind. </p>
<p>In fact, the power of wind can be quite strong; the Xie Qing Pill is indicated for this.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>When there is deficiency, wind causes spasms and weakness; this is treated with Dihuang Wan. </p>
<p>When the heart is affected by the liver, and there are strong邪热 (pathogenic heat), leading to spasms, it is treated with Lijing Wan or Liangjing Wan. </p>
<p>When the lung is affected by the liver, if邪气 (pathogenic qi) is rampant causing yawning and slight spasms, one should drain the lung and first tonify the root organ. For tonifying the liver, Dihuang Wan is used; for draining the lung, Xiebai San is used. </p>
<p>When the spleen is affected by the liver, with slight邪 (pathogenic influence) causing excessive sleepiness and heaviness leading to spasms, one should first stabilize the spasms, treated with Xieqing Wan. If the spasms stop, further treatment can be decided. </p>
<p>When the kidney is affected by the liver, with deficiency causing cold, yawning, and spasms, Qianghuo Gao is used.</p>
<p>Liu Shi remarks: Whenever there is liver illness, one must first examine the lung and kidney to discern the origin of the illness. After assessing the deficiency or excess of the liver&#39;s root organ, one can proceed with treatment. The kidney is the mother of the liver, and metal (lung) is the thief of wood (liver). If the liver is ill, and it is not due to the kidney water being unable to support it, it must be the lung&#39;s metal that attacks; thus, it must be carefully examined.</p>
<p>If the issue arises in the lung, treat the lung first to combat this pathogen. If it arises in the kidney, first tonify the kidney to nourish the root. Then assess the deficiency or excess of the liver and its cold or heat condition.</p>
<p>Haizang states: When the liver experiences urgency, sweet foods can ease it; licorice is effective.</p>
<p>The liver can be nourished with sourness; peony root is used.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>To address liver deficiency, supplement with ingredients like ginger and dried tangerine peel. When there is deficiency, nourish its source; the kidney is the mother of the liver, so use cooked rehmannia and angustifolia to nourish the kidney. If there are no other symptoms, Qian&#39;s Rehmannia Pill can be used for supplementation. </p>
<p>For Liver Nourishing Pills, add Fangfeng and Qianghuo to the Four Substance Decoction, grind into a fine powder, and form into pills with honey. </p>
<p>The Tranquil Liver Pill is made by removing gardenia and rhubarb from the Xiao Qing Pill. For treating liver deficiency, use Qian&#39;s Kidney Nourishing Rehmannia Pill. </p>
<p>For liver excess, relieve it with white peony root. If there are no other symptoms, Qian&#39;s Xiao Qing Pill is recommended. When there is excess, relieve the son; the heart is considered the son of the liver, so licorice can be used to clear the heart. </p>
<p>To disperse, immediately consume pungent foods to disperse it, such as Chuanxiong.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>To treat with xīn (a type of medicinal herb), we use xìxīn (Asarum).</p>
<p>Heart</p>
<p>Heart conditions often manifest as crying, panic, trembling of the hands and feet, fever, and thirst. Jie Gu said: The heart governs heat; if the illness is due to great heat, then Xièxīn Decoction is the remedy. If it is due to excessive internal heat, then Huánglián Xièxīn Decoction should be used. If it is a deficiency causing panic, then Shēngxī San is the remedy. If the lungs invade the heart, resulting in slight evil causing wheezing and strong heat, then Xièbái San should be used. If the liver is attacking the heart, resulting in deficiency and wind-heat, then Dàqiānghuó Decoction or Dàqīng Wán should be used. If the spleen is invading the heart, causing excessive evil and heat in the body, then Xièhuáng San is the remedy. If the kidneys are invading the heart, causing fear and the spread of evil cold, then Ānshén Wán is the treatment. </p>
<p>Liu said: If the heart becomes ill, one must first regulate the liver and kidneys. The kidneys are the spirit of the heart; when liver qi is smooth, heart qi is harmonious; when liver qi is stagnant, heart qi is deficient. Thus, treat the liver first to purify its source. When the five organs are ill, the illness must first be conveyed to the organ it overcomes. Water can conquer fire, hence if the kidneys are affected, the illness will certainly transmit to the heart, so treat the kidneys first to eliminate the evil. Therefore, one should restore kidney qi and enhance liver qi with both remedies.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>If the pulse is examined and both the liver and kidneys are harmonious, yet the heart develops an illness, then the condition of the heart&#39;s excess or deficiency should be carefully treated. </p>
<p>If there is crying, fever, thirst with a desire for water, convulsions with strength, and sleeping on the back, this indicates excess heat in the heart, and one should use Xie Xin Decoction and Dao Chi San. </p>
<p>If there is fever, desire for soup, convulsions with weakness, fright, grinding of teeth, and sleeping with the face down, this indicates deficiency heat in the heart, and one should use Bu Xin San.</p>
<p>If there is wheezing, coughing with a flushed face, and strong thirst, this indicates the lungs overpowering the heart, and one should use Xie Bai San. </p>
<p>If there is head shaking, eyes glaring, body heat with convulsions, this indicates the liver overpowering the heart, and one should use Chai Hu Qing Gan San. </p>
<p>If there is closed eyes with deep sleep, diarrhea, and body heat, this indicates the spleen overpowering the heart, and one should use Xie Huang San. </p>
<p>If there are fright, palpitations, grinding of teeth, and hot feet, this indicates the kidneys overpowering the heart, and one should use An Shen Wan.</p>
<p>Hai Zang said: For bitter heart with a slow pulse, urgently consume sour foods to regulate it, such as Schisandra berries. </p>
<p>If the heart desires to be softened, urgently consume salty foods to soften it, such as Glauber’s salt.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>To complement the deficiency, use Xian and Ze Xie.<br>To alleviate with sweetness, use Ren Shen, Huang Qi, and Gan Cao.<br>For a weak heart, supplement with roasted salt. If deficient, strengthen the mother; the liver is the mother of the heart, so use ginger to nourish the liver. If there are no other symptoms, Qian&#39;s An Shen Wan is appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Palpitations</strong></p>
<p>The human body has nine organs. The heart houses the spirit, the liver houses the soul, and both organs are responsible for blood. When blood is insufficient, the spirit and soul become unsettled, resulting in palpitations. It is said: the color of the east is green, corresponding to the liver, and its disorder leads to fright. It is also stated: when two yangs and one yin cause illness, it gives rise to frights. &quot;Fright&quot; refers to the heart suddenly moving and feeling fear; &quot;palpitation&quot; refers to the heart beating rapidly and feeling startled. Both arise from a deficiency of heart qi and blood, leading to forgetfulness, treated with Si Wu and calming herbs. Dan Xi noted that if related to phlegm, use Wen Dan Tang, adding Chen Sha and Yuan Zhi. If thoughts provoke movement, it indicates deficiency; use Yang Xin Tang. If symptoms appear intermittently, it indicates phlegm; use Fu Ling Wan. If easily startled by external events, it indicates weakness and fear of the heart and gallbladder; use Wen Dan Tang. If sleepless with frequent nightmares, it indicates that blood is not returning to the source; use Zhen Zhu Mu Wan. If dreams are unrestful, it indicates the liver’s soul is unguarded; use Ding Zhi Wan. If fearful and unable to be alone, it indicates coldness in gallbladder qi; use Fu Shen Tang. If restless during sleep, it indicates excess heat in gallbladder qi; use Suan Zao Ren Wan.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Dizziness and palpitations arise from internal phlegm due to wind; use the original formula of cinnabar and polygala pills. When thoughts and worries become congested, with a deficiency in the spleen and stagnation in qi, use the Gui Pi Decoction. Although the previous symptoms are attributed to the heart and liver, the blood is actually governed by the spleen. The spleen is associated with thought; excessive thinking depletes blood and fails to nourish the liver. The heart is directed by the spleen; internal agitation of thoughts invariably engages the heart. The heart, being the organ of the sovereign fire, presides over the twelve officials. The virtue of the sovereign is to be commanding without anger and to govern without effort; thus, it should be calmed with tranquility and guarded against impulsiveness. Movement leads to the intertwining of the fire energies, exhausting the essence and blood; when essence and blood are depleted, the fire can manifest alone, giving rise to anxiety and palpitations, the fire of the five emotions that the heart cannot control. Therefore, in treating the spleen, one must understand nourishing the heart; in nourishing the heart, one must know how to calm it and desire less. Yet, who among people is without thought? Proper thought leads to freedom from desires of impulsive action. Zhuzi said: One must ensure that the way of the heart always governs the whole body, and that the human heart must always obey it. This is the essence of nourishing the heart.</p>
<p>Regarding shock, Lou Shi states: Shock and convulsions are one and the same, yet there are distinctions based on morning and evening, and surface and internal differences. Someone with great heat in their body will have acute shock, while someone with cold and weak energy will experience chronic shock. Those who fall and make sounds, or drool when waking, have epilepsy. Those who gaze upward with their heads have a condition known as &quot;tian diao&quot; (heavenly hang), and those whose limbs are arched in spasm are in convulsions, with different treatments for each condition.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br><strong>Supplementing and Draining Method</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: If there is a strong liver condition due to spleen disease, the method should be to supplement the spleen, but there is a fear that the wood element might cause harm. Therefore, it is advisable to first drain the heart and liver to lessen their strength, and only then should one supplement the spleen. In cases of tidal heat and convulsions occurring during the Rat, Ox, or Pig hours, this indicates the kidneys are in action. If there are not severe convulsions but restlessness while sleeping, a strong and warm body, eyes that squint or gaze off, phlegm in the throat, dark brown stools, indigestible food, and excessive sleep leading to no awareness, one should supplement the spleen and treat the heart, as such conditions often arise from the spleen and stomach being weakened after a major illness.</p>
<p><strong>Exterior and Interior</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: Children who are born weak and timid often suffer from wind-induced convulsions. This condition arises from a cold, similar to that which adults experience with wind, cold, and phlegm; once treated, they recover. Convulsions caused by overeating refer to those that do not happen suddenly due to other issues; instead, they arise from excessive food intake damaging the spleen and stomach, resulting in children sleeping excessively and vomiting, showing no interest in food. When the spleen and stomach are weak, it can provoke liver wind, leading to convulsions. First, one should stabilize the convulsions using preparations like Qianghuo and Fangfeng decoctions to drain and expel, then use Bai Bingzi to promote digestion. As the patient’s appetite improves, use Tiaozhong Wan and Yigong San to nourish their energy. Lou Shi said: If the fear is due to external factors and the original qi is not ill, it should be treated with the bitter cold of Huanglian to calm the spirit. If the disturbance is due to internal air movement and not because of external shocks, and the original qi is indeed ill, it should be treated with the sweet cold of Shuilianshi to calm the spirit.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Sudden and Slow Shock</h3>
<p>The sudden and slow shocks experienced by children are historically referred to as yin-yang convulsions. The sudden type belongs to yang, where yang is excessive and yin is deficient; the slow type belongs to yin, where yin is excessive and yang is deficient. Yang is active and can cause agitation, while yin is calm and tends to be slow—all due to the weaknesses of the organs. Weakness can induce heat, and heat can create wind, thus wind arises from the liver, phlegm from the spleen, shock from the heart, and heat from the liver, which also affects the heart.</p>
<p>Combining shock, wind, phlegm, and heat results in four syndromes, while manifestations such as twitching, convulsing, spasms, trembling, reversal, pulling, retreating, and visual disturbances represent eight signs. Eye blinking, head shaking, mouth opening with tongue protrusion, red lips and flushed face, bluish complexion around the eyes and lips, and any bluish diarrhea, along with prominent veins on the temples, all indicate signs of convulsive shock.</p>
<p>Generally, the contention between liver wind and heart fire must involve heart heat to manifest, starting with twitching. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the condition based on deficiency and excess, first identifying the direction of symptoms before treatment, which must be addressed in the correct sequence.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>In essence, real heat corresponds to acute fright, while false heat corresponds to chronic fright; chronic fright should not have heat, as any heat that appears is of a false nature. Acute fright pertains to Yang, treated with cold medicine; chronic fright pertains to Yin, treated with warm medicine. However, one must clearly understand the nuances of severity, weight, progression, retreat, speed, and slowness, thus it is said that the discussion of heat concerns the true and the false. </p>
<p>For men, twitching left looks left; for women, twitching right looks right. Men’s eyes tend to dart upwards, while women’s eyes tend to dart downwards. Men grasp the thumb and point outward, while women grasp the thumb and pull inward. Men pull straight left and curve right, while women pull straight right and curve left. All of this follows a pattern; going against it is considered the reverse. There are cases where one twitches left first and then double twitches. Yet, the correct twitching is silent, while the incorrect twitching is noisy. </p>
<p>The fingerprints that curve inward represent the correct direction, while those that curve outward represent the reverse; if the entrance and exit are half and half, recovery is difficult; thus it is stated, the distinction between reverse and correct direction lies here. Yang diseases affect Yin channels, and Yin diseases affect Yang channels, representing a reversal. In general, excessive heat produces phlegm, abundant phlegm causes fright, intense fright creates wind, and excessive wind causes twitching.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>To treat convulsions, one must first address wind; to treat wind, one must first resolve fright; to treat fright, one must first eliminate phlegm; to treat phlegm, one must first relieve heat. If all four conditions are present, one should apply combined treatments; if one aspect is neglected, it will surely lead to other ailments. Hence, it is said that treatment has its order. This is the guiding principle. </p>
<p>If we differentiate among the three types, the acute convulsion is characterized by violent symptoms, while the heavy symptoms indicate a chronic convulsion. A severe case is linked to liver wind, where wood overcomes the spleen and earth, thus resulting in chronic spleen wind.</p>
<p>Loushi states: Acute convulsion symptoms belong to the excess of wood, fire, and earth. When wood is in excess, it causes major convulsions, with the eyes rolling upwards; the term &quot;wood excessively&quot; means it causes eruptions. Such movement leads to dizziness or seizures. When fire is excessive, there will be heat in the body and face; with excess earth, there will be no vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in a closed-eye state. Therefore, the treatment should involve cooling and purging, utilizing formulas like Cool Fright Pill and Expelling Fright Pill.</p>
<p>Chronic convulsion symptoms pertain to the deficiency of wood, fire, and earth. When wood is deficient, convulsions are slight, resembling shaking but not severe; this is described as &quot;wood insufficient,&quot; leading to an unstable condition. The patient may exhibit shaking and fear.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>It is said that the twitching of the hands and feet, as well as abdominal distress, is due to fear and palpitation of the heart. When fire is deficient, the body and breath are cold; when earth is deficient, one may experience vomiting, diarrhea, and sleep disturbances. Therefore, the treatment should focus on warming and tonifying, using Qianghuo ointment and Yihuang powder. For those with heat, one should use Dongyuan Huangqi Yihuang powder. Dongyuan’s treatment differs from Qian’s Qianghuo ointment, which addresses chronic fright; it is said that earth deficiency leads to diarrhea and the wood rising above it, indicating warmth in both the palm and abdomen. If there is deficiency of fire, wood, and earth, accompanied by shaking and anxiety, with cold hands and abdomen, only Qianghuo ointment can treat it.</p>
<p>Danxi states: There are two types of pediatric convulsions: acute convulsion is related to phlegm-heat and should be treated with cooling and purging; chronic convulsion is due to spleen deficiency, which is often fatal, and should be treated with warming and tonifying measures. For acute convulsion, one should use fire-reducing and phlegm-eliminating pills, along with blood-nourishing herbs prepared as a decoction; for chronic convulsion, the spleen should be supplemented, using Zhu Sha An Shen pills alongside clear rice soup. Additionally, one should seek remedies in blood-nourishing herbs such as Si Wu, Si Jun, and Dongyuan Huangqi Yihuang powder. The idea that a single remedy can universally treat this condition is highly misguided.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p>
<h3>Sudden Shock</h3>
<p>The condition of sudden shock, also known as true convulsion, manifests with tightly clenched jaws, intense fever, copious saliva, and a restlessness of the eyes. There are involuntary spasms and tremors, with frequent blinking of the lips, mouth, eyebrows, and eyes. The breath in the mouth is cold, the face is flushed, and the lips are red. Excretion is yellow and red, and the pulse is floating, rapid, and forceful. This indicates an internal accumulation of heat combined with an external invasion of wind. The heart is affected by heat that accumulates and induces shock, while wind arises in the liver, triggering convulsions. The liver wind and heart fire clash between the two organs, disrupting the blood and qi, leading to an abundance of phlegm and saliva. The blood vessels become rigid and boiling, with blockages in the body&#39;s orifices. Wind qi is prevalent and has no outlet, causing violent episodes. </p>
<p>In another variation, there may be spasms and strabismus without tightly clenched jaws and no phlegm in the mouth, but with heat in the breath. One cannot immediately conclude this as a case of shock; it may instead be due to a cold or wind attack, food-related disturbances, or ailments like rash and pox. This aligns with the theory of pseudo-convulsion posited by the Qian family, with treatment tailored to the specific condition. Additionally, in cases of sudden shock with spasms, one should not try to restrain but rather support; otherwise, wind and epilepsy may invade the meridians, leading to constrained limbs and resulting in debilitation.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>Sudden fright arises from heat generated in the heart, leading to a warm body, flushed face, thirst, and hot breath, with yellow and red urine and stools. In severe cases, convulsions may occur; when heat is intense, wind arises, associated with the liver. This reflects a condition of excessive yang and deficient yin. Therefore, the &quot;Li Jing Wan&quot; is prescribed to dispel phlegm-heat; one must not use Ba Dou or strong purgatives, fearing the convulsions will not resolve due to excessive heat. </p>
<p>In children, heat phlegm may disturb the heart and stomach, so upon hearing a loud sound, they may be startled and convulse. Even in cases of extreme heat, they may convulse without any sound or fright. </p>
<p>Yan&#39;s theory states: When sudden fright has internal heat, it generates wind, and it may also arise from fright. Symptoms include a taut gaze, excessive salivation, and both the body and breath feeling hot; once the convulsions have subsided or they wake up, they may return to normal. This indicates a case of sudden fright. As the convulsive tendencies decrease, administer a dose or two of calming and heat-clearing herbs, such as Shexiang Wan, Zhenxin Wan, Baolong Wan, or Chenshi Wan. Once the fright has stabilized, it is essential to medicate to eliminate phlegm heat, using items like Li Jing Wan, Ruan Jin Dan, or Tao Zhi Wan, to clear phlegm heat and calm the heart and mind, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Jie Gu states: Sudden fright is a yang disorder affecting the organs. Heat phlegm lodges in the heart and lungs, which indicates thriving lesser yang fire. The scriptures say: heat generates wind, occurring from hearing a loud sound. This references the east&#39;s thunder hexagram, inspired by fire energy that induces convulsions; fire itself is immobile but moves with wind. Accordingly, one should use Li Jing Wan, Dao Chi San, Xie Qing Wan, or Di Huang Wan. Once convulsions cease, it is advisable to take tranquilizing pills.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>Danji said: When startled, the wind causes a fiery sensation in the mouth and makes it difficult to speak, the hands and feet feel hot and the heart is also hot. If there is phlegm cough and phlegm asthma, one should use the method of expulsion and prepare powdered dried mulberry leaves and mulberry cowhorn in proper doses to balance the wind. [The mulberry cowhorn is the white and yellow variant compared to the poplar cowhorn.]</p>
<p>Additionally, take one tael each of northern mint leaves and cold water stone, and ten grams each of indigo, white silkworms, and cinnabar, along with two whole scorpions, and half a tael each of pig&#39;s tooth soap pod and locust pods; grind everything into powder and mix it with lampwick soup and milk for administration. When the bow is drawn back and the eyes are straight looking, due to the shock, it is advisable to use Nanxing and Banxia mixed with ginger juice and bamboo sap for administration, followed by moxibustion on Yintang.</p>
<p>For initial fright, use Fengfeng Da Chi Powder: blend equal parts of raw dried rehmannia, Sichuan pueraria, fengfeng, and licorice, and decoct with three qian of bamboo leaves. You must also prepare calming ointment: one tael each of dried lily without heart, bezoar stone, and white mustard, along with one qian of musk; grind them extremely finely, mix with refined honey, and form into small cakes. Take one cake dissolved in mint tea before sleeping, one each night.</p>
<p>Experienced doctors often say that children&#39;s fright and convulsions are mostly due to heat conditions; if you use fright medications like white attached bellflower, whole scorpions, silkworms, and Sichuan black grass first, it will lead to bad conditions. Later, if there are pediatricians, they simply use Da Chi Powder along with dried rehmannia and fengfeng for three doses to remove the evil heat obstructing the heart, and then the convulsions will stop. Following this, taking the calming ointment will produce remarkable effects.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>From a young age, Sun Daorun suffered from severe convulsions. Famous pediatric specialists in Yanjing were consulted, but it only worsened his condition. His elder brother, Yu An, sought a remedy from me, which I provided in two doses, and he was immediately cured. After that, he often used this remedy to help others, and no one failed to benefit from it. Fearing that people might forget this remedy, I decided to document it.</p>
<p>Zeng said: The discourse on acute fright was not recorded in previous writings, only referred to as &quot;yang epilepsy.&quot; Generally, it occurs due to lack of care, either by being held in a draft or near a hot area, consuming too much spicy food during the day, or using excessively thick bedding at night. This leads to the accumulation of oppressive heat in the heart, which spreads to the liver. Upon being startled by people, falling, shouting, thunder, music, or the barking of dogs, any sudden fright before it manifests causes disturbances at night—either laughing or crying during sleep, grinding teeth, sweating on the forehead and nose, shortness of breath, and sudden fainting, with the eyes gazing upwards, jaws tightly clenched, and limbs convulsing. This is due to excessive heat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the face may turn red, and the pulse can be distinguished as rapid. It is evident that there is heat in the heart and wind in the liver; both organs represent the utmost of yang. The heat of the heart and the wind of the liver, corresponding to yang phenomena, when wind governs movement and heat (when fueled by wind) rises like smoke and flames. This creation of the five elements involves the two yangs clashing, with wind and fire contending. The liver stores the soul, while the heart stores the spirit. Due to heat, the spirit can easily be disturbed, resulting in fright. The heart governs the spirit; it does not remain unaffected. When startled, heat arises, leading to the wind, which can result in convulsions, termed acute fright.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>The method of treatment begins with the use of Wuling San combined with Huangqin and licorice, decocted in water, or Baijie San to expel the wind. Next, to relieve the heart&#39;s energy, use Mutong San and Sanjie San; to smooth and cleanse the liver channel, stabilize the spirit, and reduce heat, use Niubang Tang and Fangfeng Tang as main treatments. Once the wind from fright is eliminated, for milder cases, administer Banxia Wan; for severe cases, use Shuijing Dan to eliminate phlegm, thus preventing the formation of dementia, but one must avoid using cold and cooling medicines. When heat dissipates, cold arises; excess leads to harm, hence it must be regulated. If by chance, during an emergency, both fright and wind symptoms occur, use only Wuling San with powdered cinnabar, mixed with mint decoction for relief. Wuling San contains ZeXie, which promotes urination. The heart and small intestine are interrelated; when the small intestine functions well, the heart energy is able to flow, thereby reducing fright symptoms. The presence of cinnamon in the formula allows it to restrain liver energy, thus stopping the wind. Moreover, the addition of cinnabar can calm the spirit, addressing both needs appropriately. In summary, after alleviating heat and cooling the heart and liver, it is advisable to use Pinghe Tang San for regulation; slightly warming agents are difficult to apply. Practitioners should be cautious! I often feel disheartened when witnessing others, upon seeing signs of fright, failing to distinguish between the root and branch, mistakenly treating them as one syndrome, hastily administering cold and harsh treatments such as metal, stone, musk, silkworm, scorpion, and others that search for wind, consuming vital energy and exacerbating symptoms, often leading to irreparable damage.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>Little do they know that shock arises from the heart, wind from the liver, and convulsions from the qi; these are the three proofs. The nature of shock and wind has already been detailed. However, regarding the so-called buildup of qi that leads to convulsions, the arguments of the Chen family are most insightful, though they do not specify the method. In this proof, I use the Wide Qi Decoction primarily based on bitter orange peel and fruit. The essence of qi is that when the four seasons are harmonious, the body is stable; any stagnation of breath leads to illness. Moreover, young children cry intermittently; their qi becomes trapped, unable to rise and fall internally or release externally, which can also lead to convulsions at times. A good physician examines the source of the illness and treats it without fail. Further, one must discern between yin and yang, deficiency and excess, without negligence. If it is an excess of yang, boil Five Harmony Decoction and adjust with Three Resolving Powders; this addresses acute shock with convulsions. If it is a deficiency of yin, boil Firm True Decoction and adjust with Wide Qi Decoction; this addresses chronic shock with convulsions. If there is a sudden onset of this condition without distinguishing between the yin and yang deficiency or excess, first use Five Lin Powder combined with Wide Qi Decoction, adding a little warming drink; the three medicines combined, adjusted with ginger juice in boiling soup, will provide relief. Generally, the method to treat convulsions is to emphasize the importance of wide qi; when qi flows smoothly, convulsions cease, which is the principle of nature. Overall, for children, to ensure they do not frequently experience shock and anxiety, it relies on the health of the kidneys. Hence, Dai says: &quot;To treat shock, it is better to nourish the kidneys.&quot;<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>It is said that the heart belongs to fire, which is inherently dry. When it receives the energy of the liver, smoke and flames arise, leading to palpitations. Nourishing the kidneys causes water to rise and fire to diminish, preventing the invasion of pathogenic heat. Even if there is liver wind, one will not be troubled by fright. The method should be to take a dose of Rehmannia Six Formula at the hour of Shen. Alternatively, one may use Amber-Encased Dragon Pill. The reason for using the hour of Shen is that water arises during this time; when complemented with medicinal herbs, the kidney water becomes balanced, and the heart fire does not inflame, thus avoiding fright.</p>
<p>In treating with the Ling Fang method, the medications should be arranged in a sequence of priority, distinguishing between light and heavy. After unblocking the passages, one should first regulate wind and settle spasms. Once the wind and spasms are addressed, then one can treat phlegm-heat, which is the most appropriate approach. If the issue lies in phlegm-heat without any frightful wind, one can only reduce heat and transform phlegm without carelessly administering remedies for fright. This is because many medications are cold and cooling, which may draw phlegm heat into the meridians. </p>
<p>When the illness lies in heat, one should not rashly treat phlegm but should focus on expelling the external pathogens. If the issue is with fright, one should not carelessly treat wind. Fright arises from phlegm-heat; therefore, it is only necessary to reduce heat and transform phlegm to stop the fright. If phlegm is the problem, one should not hastily treat for fright but should urgently reduce heat and transform phlegm. If the issue is with wind, one should not hastily treat spasms. Wind arises from fright; thus, one should only address the fright and transform phlegm, allowing the wind to disperse. If there are spasms, one must use the methods to intercept wind and stop fright, which is the most excellent approach.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>If the fright is treated but the phlegm does not resolve, and the heat does not recede, how can the fright cease on its own? If the phlegm is transformed but the heat does not retreat, and the wind does not disperse, how can the phlegm be expelled? Thus, it is understood that a treatment that is not treated is, in fact, the treatment that is referred to. In cases of acute fright, if the wind has been restrained, while phlegm and heat are both released, one must urgently use remedies to harmonize the stomach and settle the heart. If the wind has been restrained but the phlegm and heat are not excessive, then using light medicine to resolve phlegm and eliminate heat is adequate. However, in cases of acute fright, though it should be treated immediately, one must not excessively use cold and cool medicines, as well as mercury, light powder, croton seeds, Glauber&#39;s salt, and the like too abruptly. If such actions are taken, they should only be done when necessary, so as to stop the illness as soon as possible. If unsuitable treatments are applied or if appropriate treatments are overused, it may lead to a chronic fright condition. Moreover, simply exhausting phlegm and heat does not require excessive measures; it suffices to carefully consider using only rhubarb. Additionally, the underlying root of acute fright lies in removing liver wind and lowering heart fire, which the early texts regard as crucial. </p>
<p>Xue stated: In cases of acute fright, symptoms include a tight jaw, intense heat with salivation, altered vision, trembling, heat in the mouth, flushed cheeks, red lips, and a rapid floating pulse. This indicates that the blood in the liver is deficient, leading to fire causing wind. When wind arises, it scatters the yin blood further; the yin fire intensifies, resulting in the depletion of lung metal and surplus in liver wood, and therefore one should nourish liver blood and support spleen qi. If one frequently consumes remedies that expel wind, transform phlegm, and clear heat, it is advisable to realize that there is a deficiency in the spleen and a loss of blood, and thus one should urgently replenish spleen energy. When phlegm and heat initially occur without fright or wind condition, one should first release the exterior, expel liver wind, and lower heart fire.</p>
<p>The harmonizing remedy is Xiang Su San, plus Kudzu for muscle relaxation.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>In the case of sudden fright, it can open the meridians, and must stabilize the trembling. Various winds constrict and block the vital points, causing phlegm and saliva to accumulate, thus impeding the flow of qi. First, use Suhexiang pills, soaked in ginger juice and mixed with mint tea, to help descend the qi, which will in turn help phlegm descend, allowing the vital points to open.</p>
<p>In any case of downward treatment, one must first inquire if the previous practitioner has treated it by purging or vomiting; if the patient has been purged or vomited, do not administer additional purging. Instead, focus on expelling wind, transforming phlegm, and clearing heat. Generally, if there is a severe heat from phlegm, about two-thirds can be reduced.</p>
<p>In the downward formula, it is essential to include zhiqiao (bitter orange) and pungent herbs like changpu to ease the heart and promote the flow of qi as supportive ingredients. Acute fright must be treated immediately; delays can lead to a deeper condition. If there is confusion regarding the diagnosis, do not indiscriminately apply remedies.</p>
<p>Once the fright has been transmitted, one must cool and stabilize the wind in a sequence; if the wind has settled, there are three stages in the downward process: first a light purge, then slightly heavier, and finally an even stronger purge. After administering the treatment, harmonize the stomach and support qi; subsequently, calm the mind and settle the spirit, expel wind and quiet fright, preventing recurrence.</p>
<p>If after purging the symptoms still persist and recovery is not easily achievable, do not purge again, but rather treat it as a chronic fright and analyze it thoroughly.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>In cases of slow shock, there may be vomiting or diarrhea, slight wheezing and panting, eyes open with a relaxed spirit, revealing the whites while asleep, sudden jumps and convulsions. There are moments of onset and stillness, sometimes body heat, sometimes body cold, limbs feeling hot, or cool air from the mouth and nose, complexion pale white or bluish, with possible darkening between the eyebrows and lips. The pulse is deep, slow, scattered, and relaxed. This is generally caused by sudden fright, excessive use of cold and cool substances, or a rapidly occurring transformation. There are also instances caused by persistent vomiting and diarrhea, or by sudden weakness leading to violent vomiting and diarrhea. In summer, with heat in the spleen and stomach, significant vomiting and diarrhea are meant to relieve summer heat, not simply to reinforce Yang. There are conditions from organ deficiency leading to leakage, from chronic dysentery causing loss of qi, accumulation causing diarrhea, and from vomiting blood or diarrhea of blood. There are cases where prolonged coughing leads to convulsions, or cases where convulsions continue unabated, or cases where parasitic accumulation attacks the heart.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>If there are symptoms of egg-sized swelling, hernia, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, spleen distress with thirst, swelling in the limbs, constipation, and urgent lingering illnesses, then it is often a case of chronic transmission. However, if vomiting and diarrhea have led to a deficiency causing severe changes in symptoms, then the condition will worsen rapidly. Generally, if one has just experienced vomiting or diarrhea, it is considered a case of chronic shock, and one must use a warming method to support the interior. If there are sudden spasms, it indicates the initial transmission of chronic shock that still exhibits Yang symptoms; one must not mistakenly treat this as acute shock. It is often said that spasms indicate chronic shock, but this is not accurate. If one misunderstands this, they often confuse chronic spleen issues with chronic shock. For men, chronic shock mainly arises from diarrhea; for women, it arises more from vomiting. Additionally, there are five types of vomiting and five types of diarrhea, each with specific causes and treatments. As the ancients said, patients fear shock but do not fear diarrhea, while doctors fear diarrhea but do not fear shock. If diarrhea does not cease, priority should be given to treating the diarrhea. If one instead treats for wind, the shock may worsen. In case of other symptoms, the original treatment approach should be followed. For chronic shock, if it originates from acute shock, one can only balance the wind and adjust the stomach, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang. One must not solely use Yang medications, which could aggravate the condition and lead to acute shock symptoms again.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>When treating with medicine, one must avoid extremes. In cases of sudden fright causing blockage, slightly administering musk can help restore flow; it&#39;s possible to stabilize the convulsions. For slow fright with excessive yin and deficient yang, the channels are already weak, so unblocking is not advisable; instead, cool the organs to prevent the emergence of chronic spleen wind. In the case of slow fright being critical, symptoms include blurred vision with blinking, yet no lateral eye movement, possibly with squinting, cold limbs, profuse sweating, dark complexion, black nails, and limbs that feel heavy. For slow fright symptoms, the eyes may be half open and half closed, resembling a state of wakefulness without being fully awake. The pulse may be either floating or sinking, the body may feel hot or cold, there may be vomiting or diarrhea, or there may be none, with issues involving feeding. This condition is named a combined disease of half yin and half yang, similar to a situation of cold damage affecting both the exterior and interior. The treatment principle is to investigate the source and flow of the symptoms carefully; one must not generalize the diagnosis of slow fright. If it arises from vomiting or diarrhea, using something like the Tang&#39;s Awakening Spleen Powder is appropriate; other symptoms may be referenced accordingly.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>If lingering fright has transmitted into the yin, it is necessary to measure the deficiencies and excesses of yin and yang, considering the shallow and deep aspects. One must not overly use warming and drying medicines. Jie Gu said: Lingering fright is a condition where the internal organs suffer from illness, often caused by infants suffering from long-term vomiting and diarrhea, leading to spleen and stomach deficiency. If not treated early, it can develop into lingering fright, known as &quot;twitching,&quot; which resembles convulsions but is not severe. Due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, the stool does not consolidate. One should first dispel wind from the spleen, starting with Xuan Feng San to guide it out, followed by Yi Huang San and Shi Jun Zi Wan to balance it, which will naturally cease the symptoms. If treatment has been delayed, both the spleen and stomach are deficient, which allows the liver&#39;s wood element to conflict with them, leading to lingering fright. Warming tonics should be used, with Qiang Huo Gao being the main remedy. Yan Xiao Zhong compiled the Qian family&#39;s prescriptions using Yi Huang to nourish the earth, which is effective. This medicine contains clove, which is spicy and heating, promoting fire; with excessive fire, the earth becomes more deficient. Green tangerine peel drains the lung metal, while clove is spicy and heating, significantly draining the lungs and large intestine. The spleen is usually in excess and should be drained, but now with the spleen and stomach being deficient, further draining will only increase the fire and severely weaken the earth, leading to dangerous consequences.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>The wind and wood are strong, and the right pulse is large and vigorous, with heat in the palm and warmth in the abdominal skin. How can one assist fire to drain gold in this condition? If cold water invades the spleen and earth, the symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea with greenish-white stools. The remedy should be the Yi Huang San. Now, I propose a formula to first drain fire and nourish gold while heavily supplementing the earth, which is the method of divine healing. Use two qian of Huang Qi, one qian of Ren Shen, five fen of roasted Gan Cao, and one qian of Bai Shao. All four ingredients are sweet and warm, capable of replenishing the original qi. Sweetness can drain fire. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: heat thrives within, and it is to be drained by sweetness and restrained by sourness. Bai Shao is sour and cold; the cold can drain fire, and its sour flavor can regulate the liver, while greatly nourishing lung metal. This replenishes the position of gold and earth, where metal is strong and fire is deficient—how can wind and wood overcome the earth? Then, drain the wind evil. The Yi Huang San and the Li Zhong Wan are all medicines that nourish the spirit, effective for conditions of excessive cold and dampness in the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>If there are signs of insufficient labor from the lurking fire in the spleen and stomach, and if one takes warm medicines like beans, it must harm life when the stomach is deficient and results in chronic stagnation. Chronic wind convulsions arise from prolonged diarrhea, leading to spleen and stomach deficiency. The Qian clan mistakenly uses Xianghuo ointment to treat chronic wind convulsions. Those with spleen deficiency have fire evil occupying their earth position, thus said to be a deficiency evil that arises later. When fire is strong, it can nourish wood; when wood is strong, it overcomes earth. Therefore, one should warm and sweetly nourish the source of earth in the heart, further drain fire in the spleen with sweet cold, and supplement metal in the spleen with sour coolness, resulting in the metal in the spleen thriving and fire declining, leading to a deficiency in wind and wood.</p>
<p>Haizang said: For startled sobbing with tremors of hands and feet, unstable sleep, use the Four Gentlemen decoction with whole scorpion (tail and sharp toxins removed), Diao Teng, and white Aflatoxin, equally divided and cooked together. </p>
<p>For weakness in the spleen and stomach, which often results in wind and many afflictions, use the Four Gentlemen decoction with stir-fried Banxia Qu and Meshi stone, equally ground into fine powder, added with a little winter melon seeds, and cooked together for consumption.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>Danqi said: Frequent vomiting and diarrhea will result in chronic fright. Use one qian of Qian&#39;s white atractylodes powder, add stir-fried yam and hyacinth bean, and braise with nutmeg. Add a slice of ginger to decoct and take. If chronic fright has already occurred, add one qian each of fine lovage and gastrodia, three whole scorpions (removing the stinger), and eight fen of white peony powder to braise. For fright with diarrhea, use ginseng, poria, and peony sautéed with white atractylodes and ginger decocted. In summer, add coptis, licorice, and bamboo leaves to take.</p>
<p>Zeng said: There are no references in ancient texts for treating chronic fright, only mentions of yin convulsion. Chronic fright belongs to yin, and yin governs stillness, hence it is called &quot;chronic.&quot; The symptoms are mostly due to external wind and cold causing internal vomiting and diarrhea, or residual effects from a major illness, or errors from treatment afterwards, with symptoms like dullness and confusion in the eyes, twitching of hands and feet, drooling from the mouth, slight warmth in the body, upward or skewed gaze, and hand clenching along with twitching, or leg movements. Differentiate between left-side twitching in men and right-side in women as correct, and the opposite as incorrect. The breath is cold and slow, or the fontanel is sunken; this indicates extreme deficiency.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>The pulse is weak and deep; when asleep, the eyes are half-open and half-closed. This indicates a true deficiency of yang and an excess of yin, with the excess of yin giving rise to cold. Cold transforms into water, which supports the liver&#39;s wood element; wood produces wind, which weakens the spleen&#39;s earth element. Since the stomach is governed by the spleen, wind accumulates in the stomach, leading to symptoms of hysteria. </p>
<p>The signs of hysteria include slight elevation of the shoulders and drooping of the hands, with occasional uncontrollable shaking, known as slow fright. It is advisable to use Qingzhou Baiwanzi and Suhexiang Wan mixed with ginger juice and taken with rice drink for ingestion. For extreme deficiency, add Jinye Dan. </p>
<p>Next, use a harmonizing drink combined with Qibao San and decocted ginger for consumption, helping to disperse wind and ease vomiting and diarrhea, while intermittently administering Weiling Tang to support both interior and exterior. If vomiting persists, a fixing formula for vomiting can be employed; if diarrhea continues, Liu Gui San is recommended. </p>
<p>Alternatively, boiling broth can be used to dispel wind from the stomach, stabilize hysteria, and clarify the spirit and qi. Wuling San can guide the reversed flow, regulate the nourishing and protective qi, and harmonize yin and yang. If there is excessive phlegm and the lips are pale, with the limbs feeling cold and the person unresponsive, this indicates extreme deficiency. Use Guzhen Tang for rapid administration to restore stomach qi; once the stomach qi returns, apply Xingpi San or Chenxiang Yin for regulation.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br><strong>Slow Spleen Wind</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of Slow Spleen Wind include a pale face with sweating on the forehead, a short tongue and a lowered head, eyes that are difficult to open, shaking the head and sticking out the tongue while sleeping, frequent vomiting of foul-smelling substances, clenched teeth, and slight spasms of the hands and feet without retraction. The body may feel cold or warm while the limbs are cold, the pulse is deep and weak, Yin energy is extremely abundant, and stomach energy is greatly deficient, with a ratio of ten patients to one or two recoveries. This arises from chronic fright leading to vomiting and diarrhea, which harms the spleen; the disease has progressed to a severe stage, ultimately resulting in deficiency affecting the spleen, hence it is called Spleen Wind. If one tries to expel the wind, there is no wind to chase away; if one attempts to treat fright, there is no fright to treat. However, the phlegm and fluids in the spleen generate virtual heat fluctuating, causing the eyes to close due to the spleen being overburdened and energy being deficient, leading to a muddled spirit with stagnated phlegm. The term Slow Spleen is also referred to as Deficient Wind. After a child has vomited or had diarrhea, their complexion turns pale yellow due to deficiency and heat, often accompanied by head shaking, squinting, lethargy, sweaty forehead, and a weak voice—these are indicative of Spleen Wind. It is not necessary for all cases to originate from acute or chronic wind transmission; one should recognize this condition distinctly. Moreover, in discussing Slow Spleen symptoms, the spleen is mentioned without referring to the stomach. Why is that? It is because the stomach is part of the Yang organs, unlike the spleen which is an Yin organ. Hence, diseases affecting the Yang organs in children often self-resolve, while those affecting the Yin organs must be treated. The pure Yang energy of children flows smoothly in the Yang organs, but can become reversed in the Yin organs. Ancient practitioners focused their healing on the Yin organs, rarely mentioning the treatment of Yang organs.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>The kidneys, as an organ, are primarily associated with deficiency and should not be aggressively treated. If there is an affliction of the kidneys, one should merely clear the heart and lungs, as heart and kidneys are interconnected, representing a state of mutual support. The lungs and kidneys have a child-parent relationship as well. Therefore, one should avoid medicines that directly affect the kidneys or any tonics for them. In cases of chronic spleen diseases, it is usually advisable to address issues with vomiting and diarrhea; when symptoms evolve quickly, the deficiency can also progress rapidly. Treatment must follow a gradual and harmonious approach, without seeking rapid recovery. Medicines should be balanced and moderate to harmonize the spleen and nourish the stomach, avoiding excessive dosages. </p>
<p>The Qian family has a recipe for Huangtu Decoction, which utilizes earth to overcome water; when water is balanced, the wind naturally settles, relying on the spleen&#39;s earth element. </p>
<p>The primary treatment strategy focuses on restoring the stomach&#39;s yang. If the eyes are only partially open and the hands and feet are not cold, while symptoms still exhibit slow astonishment, one should not use yang recovery methods immediately. If one suspects a chronic spleen condition but the yang energy has not severely diminished, one should refrain from using substances like sulfur or aconite; rather, if the hands and feet gradually warm up, one can use formulas like Xingspi Powder to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>The Zeng family uses Qingjindan, Tianmayan Drink, or Liuzhu Powder to stabilize true vital substances. </p>
<p>If children accidentally consume cold medicines or have their mouths wiped with water-soaked cloth, this can harm their spleen and stomach, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal distension, or gurgling sounds in the abdomen. </p>
<p>Pale-faced children often lack joy, not looking up but rather down. </p>
<p>Children with a high and urgent fontanel, exhibiting blue veins, may sometimes pass green stools. </p>
<p>Well-nourished children might have stools resembling thin mucus or frozen juice.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>In childhood, if there are eye-catching symptoms, with greenish-white foam in the stool, sometimes hard and dry, and if the five symptoms emerge suddenly accompanied by vomiting, it is certain to develop into a condition called &quot;yin convulsions,&quot; commonly known as chronic fright. </p>
<p>Although the child&#39;s head is hot and the eyes are blue-white while the feet are cold, this may also be accompanied by abdominal distension with cold feet, or diarrhea with cold feet, or vomiting with cold feet, or thirst with cold feet. A hot head and red eyes, with phlegm blocking the nose and throat, indicate a source of rootless fire rising up. </p>
<p>If the five symptoms suddenly appear with vomiting and convulsions, it is referred to as &quot;chronic spleen wind.&quot; Administer a supplement to strengthen the spleen, with three qian (a measure) in one dose, increasing to include one scorpion. If the convulsion is caused by fright, give a dose of Qian Pi San—a measure of three qian—with additional half a qian each of Fu Zi and Qian Hu boiled together. </p>
<p>The above describes methods for treating chronic fright. The order of treatment forms a unique system, hence it is recorded separately for reference. Previous cases mention Xu Xu San and You Zhu Gao, which have shown consistent effectiveness.</p>
<p>For treating sudden and chronic fright:</p>
<p>Acute fright should be treated with cool purging, while chronic fright with warm tonification is the definitive method. In cases where acute cooling purging fails and transforms into chronic fright, or where chronic tonification fails and turns into acute fright, one should use the integrated medicine for both acute and chronic fright. </p>
<p>For children experiencing acute or chronic fright, with fever, oral ulcers, hot hands and feet, and phlegm heat causing cough and wheezing, the expulsion method should be employed. Strong doses should use Gua Ti San, while lighter doses can use Ku Shen and Chi Xiao Dou powder, mixed with wine and sour juices for ingestion. Afterward, use Tong Shen San in honey pill form. Between doses, mix with powdered dried mulberry cow and take to balance the qi.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br><strong>Eye twitching</strong></p>
<p>The eyes are the openings of the liver. The liver and gallbladder are associated with the wind and wood meridians, and also represent the fire of the organs. The liver stores blood; when blood is insufficient, wind and fire arise internally, causing the eyes to twitch. The classics say: &quot;Bending and straightening, swaying is the sign of wind.&quot; It is advisable to use the Four Substance Decoction to nourish the blood, and Chai Hu and Shan Zhi to cleanse the liver. When the yin blood internally nourishes, the wind will naturally subside. If the condition arises from dryness of the liver&#39;s blood, one should use the Six-Flavor Pill to nourish its source. If the lung metal overcomes the liver wood, the Xie Bai Powder should be used to pacify the metal&#39;s pathogenic influence. If the eye area twitches, it indicates that liver wood is dominating spleen earth, so Bao Long Pill should be employed. If after recovery there is lingering fright and insomnia, or twitching and teeth grinding while asleep, along with eye twitching, it is due to blood deficiency failing to nourish the sinews and vessels. One should use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction with additions of Fu Ling and Wu Wei. Generally, excess indicates pathogenic qi, while deficiency indicates true qi. In cases of excess, one should consider it as a deficiency. This condition involves both liver and spleen, often as a gradual progression of chronic fright, which should be carefully examined. </p>
<p><strong>Lip and mouth twitching</strong><a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>The lips are the flowers of the spleen, and the mouth is the opening of the spleen. Moreover, the Yangming meridian encircles the lips and mouth, intersecting at the philtrum. The Yangming corresponds to the stomach; therefore, those with spleen and stomach deficiency often present this symptom, not only after illness. The spleen governs saliva; if the spleen is weak, it cannot control it, leading to excessive salivation, which may be mistakenly recognized as phlegm. Using medicines to expel it will result in further depletion of fluids and an inability to nourish the muscles and tendons, causing spasms in the limbs and worsening the condition. The treatment method is similar to that for chronic spleen wind; one should employ strengthening medicines for the spleen and stomach, adding Asarum and Bupleurum, while avoiding substances like Qing Pi and Gentian. One should also observe the color: yellow indicates a weak spleen; green suggests a dominant liver; greenish-yellow that lacks luster indicates wood overcoming earth; a combination of green and red suggests wood-fire wind-heat; black represents cold water undermining earth; and white signifies Qi deficiency and loss of Yang. In all these cases, it is advisable to use the Six Gentleman Decoction with an addition of the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the limbs are slightly convulsing, or if there are intermittent sensations of heat, diarrhea, vomiting, or a sallow complexion, these point to damage to the spleen and stomach, for which Bai Zhu, Huang Qi, Chuan Xiong, Dang Gui, Ren Shen, Chen Pi, and Sha Ren should be used to replenish stomach Qi. If there is weakness in the spleen and stomach, the Wu Wei Yi Gong Powder should be used, and for deficiency and cold, one may add Mu Xiang and roasted ginger. If spleen Qi is sinking, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to elevate the Yang. For thirst, use the Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder to generate fluids. If the liver wood overacts on the spleen, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Bai Shao to strengthen the spleen and nourish the liver.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences sudden diarrhea, it is attributed to dispiritedness caused by the liver. The liver, associated with wood, when overactive, will negatively affect the spleen. When the spleen is weakened, food is not properly digested, and the water pathways are unregulated, leading to diarrhea that appears green, sometimes accompanied by convulsions. This is because cultivation relates to the liver’s color, while convulsions are a symptom of liver issues. There are also instances where the wet nurse&#39;s spleen is deficient due to shock, or where anger stirs up liver fire, contributing to this condition. The classics state: anger causes the qi to rebel, which can lead to vomiting blood and severe diarrhea; the appropriate treatment is to calm the liver and nourish the lungs, avoiding harsh purgatives that would further weaken the spleen. If liver disturbances become severe, even leading to convulsions, it signals excessive liver fire and imbalances in the central region. Whenever signs of shock are observed, one should use formulas like the Four Gentlemen or Six Gentlemen Decoctions, combined with white Atractylodes to pacify wind and Chai Hu to soothe the liver, preventing severe diarrhea and ensuring safety. If there are already signs of diarrhea, vomiting, shock, and convulsions, yet one does not know to nourish the spleen and soothe the liver to preserve life, then they have strayed far from the path.</p>
<p><strong>Thirst</strong></p>
<p>Yan states: Symptoms like shock, wind, or diarrhea causing thirst are all due to the consumption of body fluids. Regardless of yin or yang, one should prepare Qian&#39;s White Atractylodes Powder, ensuring ample and satisfying hydration. The more, the better.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br><strong>潮热似疟</strong></p>
<p>Zeng said: After a sudden shock from sky fishing, it may turn into tidal fever, with cold limbs, resembling malaria. This is because after being ill, one does not take proper care, and external wind and evil invade through vulnerabilities in the meridians, remaining unresolved, leading to this. The classics say: &quot;In heavy Yang there must be Yin.&quot; It also states: &quot;Excess causes harm; moderation controls it.&quot; This is its principle. One should take Chaihu decoction with cinnamon and Danggui powder. If the energy is strong, then use Wuxi pills and Shuijing pills, slightly combined with dispersing and harmonizing Qi powder to stop the supplementation, later using Shenling Baizhu powder for regulation, naturally leading to recovery. The medicines used for this condition should incorporate bitter and cold flavors to diminish the excessive Yang fire; overcoming the Lung&#39;s metal helps balance the Liver&#39;s wood, dispersing the wind-yang—thus it is a good method.</p>
<p><strong>杂惊类证</strong></p>
<p>Hai Zang said: If the heart and spirit are unsteady, use Four Gentlemen decoction with half a portion of cinnabar, adjusted with jujube soup. Another case involves wanting to develop sores and rashes, with initial body heat and hysterical jumping, or convulsions; this is not scare-induced wind, and dispersing medicines should be used. Zeng said: The summer wind ailment arises from catching wind and heat too strongly in the summer months, causing the face to darken and lips to redden, pulse to be deep, thin, and rapid, suddenly leading to convulsions and loss of consciousness. Treatment should involve cooling summer and clearing heart drinks, Cinnabar Wuling powder, and Amber Baolong pills for calmness. Avoid using warming agents for tonification.</p>
<p><strong>诊</strong></p>
<p>Qian said: Those who grind their teeth greatly experience shock.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>When the eyes are green and the body is bent, it indicates sudden fright.<br>If the face is green with yawning, it suggests wind fright.<br>If the face is yellow with yawning, it indicates spleen deficiency fright.<br>If the eyes are red and green, it signifies convulsions.<br>In cases of fright-induced convulsions, if a man has convulsions, his left gaze is silent and his right gaze is vocal; for a woman, it is the opposite, hence the difference. There are also timing indicators. Mr. Jie Gu said: Men represent wood, thus the left gaze at the wood position has no sound, while the right gaze at the metal position creates sound. Women represent metal, thus the right gaze at metal position has no sound, while the left gaze at wood creates sound. Furthermore, if the lung is deficient and does not purge, why is that? It is said: If a man&#39;s right gaze is active, wood overcomes metal, the liver is vigorous and overcomes the lung, thus only the liver is purged; if sickness occurs in spring or summer, when metal energy is extremely deficient, one should support the lung and not purge it.<br>Mr. Tang stated: For convulsions, it is easier to treat if a man has left-sided symptoms and a woman has right-sided symptoms; it is harder to treat if a man has right-sided symptoms and a woman has left-sided symptoms.<br>The &quot;Pulse Scripture Enlightenment&quot; states: In children, a rapid pulse signifies fright due to deficiency.<br>The &quot;Direct Reference&quot; says: A floating, rapid, and tense pulse indicates sudden fright; a sinking, slow, scattered, and relaxed pulse indicates chronic fright. A pulse appearing blue-purple at the tiger&#39;s mouth indicates wind fright. A red pulse signifies mild wind heat. A reddish pulse indicates severe wind heat. A purple pulse signifies extreme fright heat. A green pulse denotes accumulated fright. When blue and purple are mixed, it indicates both accumulated fright and wind heat, leading to sudden wind fright. A pale blue coupled with light purple that expands and contracts indicates chronic wind fright. A pulsing appearance with purple and blue threads or a subtle mix of black threads, resembling something emerging but not fully, denotes chronic spleen wind. If the shape and trend bend inward, it is considered harmonious; if it extends outward, it is deemed disharmonious.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br><strong>Untreatable Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>Convulsions that do not cease, paused and then convulsing again, screaming with convulsions, sweating with cold feet, phlegm filling the chest and throat, mouth open and eyes staring. Sudden fright causing eye-rolling, blood in the mouth, legs jumping, abdomen convulsing, or a calm demeanor searching for clothing, or serious symptoms with confusion and shortness of breath, unable to swallow medicine, cannot sneeze, feeling heat and pain in the heart, suddenly shouting—these are untreatable. </p>
<p>Gradually developing fright with limbs turning cold, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, face dark and spirit bleak, stomach pain and pressure in the sides, white sores in the mouth, head shaking, eyes not moving, drooling wheezing, head weak, inability to control bowel movements, hands and feet being pulled to one side—these are also untreatable. </p>
<p>Chronic cold sweat sticking to the skin, lying flat as if dead, wheezing with a soft head, straight back, mouth closed, shaking head, phlegm making a sawing sound, face lacking luster, thin lips with coarse breathing—these are untreatable.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br><strong>Curved Bow and Reflexive Spasm</strong></p>
<p>Qian said: When there is wind in the liver, the body bends backward, becoming rigid and unyielding, and the heart does not feel heat. One should nourish the kidneys and treat the liver. For nourishing the kidneys, use Dihuang Pill; for treating the liver, use Xieqing Pill. Danxi said: Spasms are more a sign of deficiency than convulsions, so one should supplement. Generally, this is associated with qi deficiency having phlegm and heat. Use ginseng and bamboo juice for treatment, avoiding medicinal herbs that are combined with wind. This view is indeed a new insight not previously mentioned by others. Although Tang said that among ten cases of spasms, only one survives, he has never actually applied this method to a patient. Qian Zhongyang stated: Curved bow and reflexive spasm are caused by wind evil invading the Yangming channel. The classics say: Wind enters from above; the Yangming meridians govern the body&#39;s overall qi, with the pulse starting at the inner corner of the eye and spreading to the back. The liver belongs to wood and governs wind, making it susceptible to invasion by wind evil.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>Children’s skin is delicate and easily harmed by external pathogens; the liver corresponds to fire, and anger can easily arise. If the body becomes rigid and hot without convulsions, it is due to wind injuring the sun; in this case, one should use Ren Shen Qiang Huo San or Xiao Xu Ming Tang. If anger causes disturbance in the liver fire, one should use Xie Qing Wan. If taking the previous remedy aggravates the symptoms, it indicates that the pathogenic qi has left but the spleen qi is deficient; one should use Yi Gong San with added Chuanxiong and Angelica for replenishment. If due to liver channel deficiency heat or depletion of true qi causes virtual heat to generate wind, one should use Yi Gong San and Di Huang Wan for supplementation. If there is exhaustion of spleen qi due to diarrhea with abdominal distension, this indicates loss of central qi; one should use Bai Zhu San for supplementation. If there is inherent weakness of qi and blood, or if one has taken purging medicines and is frequently adjusting clothing, grinding teeth, and yawning, this indicates severe deficiency of the liver channel; one should urgently use Di Huang Wan for replenishment.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Fishing</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly Fishing is also an indication of a startling wind; however, when Heavenly Fishing occurs, one looks up, and the startling wind is not present. Tang said: When a child is afflicted with convulsions, their eyes roll back and they gaze upward as if possessed, this is known as Heavenly Fishing. For those suffering from this condition, it is advisable to take Suhexiang Pills, and to cauterize the fleshy part of the thumb on both hands halfway at two points, with boys first cauterizing the left and girls the right. Additionally, cauterize the space between the big toes on both feet three to five times each, and also cauterize the palms of the hands front and back five times each. These methods are effective.</p>
<p>Zhang said: When a child&#39;s heart is obstructed, with phlegm and heat accumulating and unable to be dispelled, it may be due to the wetness and toxic air from the nursing mother consuming alcohol and meat, which flows into the milk and causes the child’s condition to worsen. The evil heat and toxic air affect the spirit, leading to symptoms of fright, rolling eyes, persistent heavy heat, and convulsions in the limbs, this ailment is called Heavenly Fishing. In severe cases, the nails may turn blue, resembling possession. Now, compile the proven methods and names from the classics for treatment.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>Seizures</p>
<p>Loushi said: Sudden seizures are symptoms of both acute and chronic conditions, but when a sudden seizure occurs, the person falls to the ground with a sound and drools upon waking; in acute and chronic cases, there is no sound and no drooling. Renzhai said: Seizures are a serious affliction in children. This is because children&#39;s blood vessels are not yet consolidated, and their vital energy and bones are not well developed. They are affected by wind pathogens, or their feeding schedule is disrupted, leading to stagnation and accumulation, resulting in these seizures. The signs include a disturbed spirit, bulging eyes, fixed gaze, and facial twitching. The mouth is tightly closed with saliva flowing, the abdomen is bloated, there are twitching hands and feet, resembling a state between life and death, sometimes vocal and sometimes mute, with either the neck and back arched, or a rigid spine. However, if the whole body is stiff and does not awaken throughout the day, it is classified as a chronic condition.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br><strong>Yin-Yang Two Types of Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>When yang epilepsy first manifests, the patient experiences body heat, followed by convulsions, fear, crying out, and shouting; a floating pulse indicates yang epilepsy, which is a sudden shock. This condition is rooted in the six hollow organs and is manifest on the skin, making it relatively easy to treat. </p>
<p>If the illness starts with body cold, without fear or seizures or shouting, and has a deep pulse, it indicates yin epilepsy, which is a chronic shock. This condition is internal to the five zang organs and external to the bones and marrow, making it difficult to treat if severe.</p>
<p>According to the Zeng family, yang epilepsy occurs after being startled by wind three times, and if wind and phlegm are not expelled, it will recur. The three occurrences should not be interpreted as three times in one day; rather, it may happen once in a month or a season, but it must occur three times overall, hence the term &quot;three times.&quot; The term &quot;three occurrences of frightful wind&quot; refers to this meaning. </p>
<p>The symptoms of this illness include body heat with sweating, eyes looking upward, grinding of teeth, jerking of limbs, a reddish-purple complexion, and a floating rapid pulse. Treat this with &quot;Bai Jie San&quot; added to &quot;Wu He Tang&quot; decoction for relief; next, expel phlegm using &quot;Shui Jing Dan&quot; or &quot;Ban Xia Wan.&quot;</p>
<p>Yin epilepsy arises from lingering phlegm after a chronic fright, with phlegm entering the pericardium. Symptoms include reversed cold in the limbs, sticking out of the tongue and head shaking, chewing white foam, tightly clenched jaws, but not severe in shock or convulsions. The complexion may appear white or blue, with a subtle deep pulse. Thus, the &quot;Children&#39;s Treasure Book&quot; states: “During sleep, when the tongue is protruded and the head shakes, this is what it refers to.” </p>
<p>Treat this condition with &quot;Gu Zhen Tang&quot; plus &quot;Hui Sheng Tang&quot; cooked together, and adjust with &quot;Kuan Qi Yin&quot; for relief.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>Wind-induced epilepsy (feng xian) has external causes, shock-induced epilepsy (jing xian) has internal causes, and food-induced epilepsy (shi xian) has causes that are neither purely internal nor external. According to &quot;Comprehensive Formulas for Infants,&quot; wind-induced epilepsy arises from improper care leading to disharmony in blood and qi, or from heavy clothing causing sweating, which opens the pores, allowing wind pathogens to enter. This illness affects the liver, which governs wind, and the symptoms include a pale face, red eyes, and convulsions. Treatment involves wind-dispelling ointments, major green ointments, and amber powders to calm shocks; if there is heat, administer the Four Harmonizing Drink followed by calming pills to resolve phlegm.</p>
<p>Shock-induced epilepsy stems from strong blood and qi, internal heat within the organs, or shock and fright that disturb the spirit, allowing external pathogens to enter. This condition affects the heart, which governs shock. Symptoms include sudden cries and convulsions, treated with amber powders, red dragon powders, and heart-soothing pills, again with the Four Harmonizing Drink and calming pills, ensuring it does not lead to other illnesses.</p>
<p>Food-induced epilepsy affects the spleen, which governs the digestion of food. Symptoms include belching with foul odors and convulsions. This may also present with sour-smelling stools that require treatment with purple pills. The three types above are largely similar and fall under the category of yang conditions. If one experiences skewed vision, twitching limbs, or produces strange sounds, recovery tends to occur after a single episode, but this is a critical condition that can lead to death in one out of ten cases.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br><strong>Five Organ Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;San Yin&quot; states: In ancient methods, there are various convulsions, including the five convulsions, five organ convulsions, and six livestock convulsions, each with different symptoms, making comprehensive documentation difficult. The &quot;Bie Lu&quot; records the symptoms of the five convulsions: </p>
<ol>
<li>The horse convulsion, which produces a horse&#39;s neigh, corresponds to the horse in the noon position, associated with the Heart governed by the Hand&#39;s Lesser Yin; thus, the illness pertains to the heart. </li>
<li>The sheep convulsion, producing a sheep&#39;s bleat, corresponds to the sheep in the late morning position, associated with the Spleen governed by the Foot&#39;s Greater Yin; thus, it pertains to the spleen. </li>
<li>The chicken convulsion, producing a chicken&#39;s crow, corresponds to the chicken in the evening position, associated with the Stomach governed by the Foot’s Yang Brightness; thus, it pertains to the stomach. </li>
<li>The pig convulsion, producing a pig&#39;s grunt, corresponds to the pig in the late night position, associated with the Heart Protector governed by the Hand&#39;s Lesser Yang; thus, it pertains to the right kidney. </li>
<li>The cow convulsion, producing a cow&#39;s moo, corresponds to the cow in the early morning position, associated with the Lung governed by the Hand&#39;s Greater Yin; thus, it pertains to the lungs.</li>
</ol>
<p>These five convulsions correspond to the five livestock and the five organs. When they occur, there may be dizziness, confusion, drooping of the mouth and eyes, shaking of the eyes, convulsions in the hands and feet, rigidity of the spine, and recovery shortly after, each treated according to their respective causes. </p>
<p>In treating the five convulsions, severe cases can be fatal, and those with significant illness can also die, while lighter cases can be managed with the Five Colors Pill. According to the &quot;Qian Jin,&quot; speaking of livestock convulsions lacks distinction regarding the five organs; Qian’s family initially made these distinctions but did not include the horse convulsion. Zeng’s family claims that the initial occurrence with sounds of sheep or dogs indicates the throat is obstructed by wind phlegm, leading to such sounds, a theory that is quite clear. </p>
<p>The term &#39;six livestock&#39; simply represents a strong designation. Thus, Dan Xi notes that the classics do not provide a basis for this, and treatment methods do not seem to delineate five distinctions, so it is unnecessary to separate them into five. </p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>Ren Zhai says: Generally, when blood stagnates in the heart&#39;s pathways, evil Qi forms in the heart, and accumulated fear leads to seizures, it is essential to circulate the heart&#39;s functions, regulate the blood vessels, smooth the Qi, and clear phlegm. For instance, if a child has a fever and phlegm, shows no desire for milk, sleeps restlessly, and frequently is startled or anxious, these are early signs of seizures. In such cases, using Zishuang Pill can guide the treatment. By reducing its strong Qi, the risk of seizures can be avoided. When the symptoms of the seizure first appear, there will surely be blue lines like threads between the high bones behind the ears; seeing this indicates the need for bloodletting and crying out to ensure the Qi flows. If there are seizures and the person cannot speak, it is because the throat, being the pathway of Qi, is affected by wind, obstructing the voice&#39;s passage, or it may be caused by blood stasis in the heart that prevents the heart&#39;s pathways from being open. Grinding Nanjing star and mixing it with a little boar&#39;s gallbladder juice can be taken, and it will yield immediate effects.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>As for the Qian family&#39;s Five Convulsions Pill and Nanshing Powder, when combined with calamus decoction to be taken with 甘遂 (Suiren) and pig heart soup, and a single Suhexiang pill, these are all essential medicines for treating convulsions. Liu stated: Children have weak spirits; when startled, their spirit does not guard the house, leaving it empty and allowing phlegm and saliva to return. If there are issues with diet, causing damage to the spleen and stomach, it accumulates as phlegm fluid, leading to phlegm obstructing the heart orifices. The treatment method should clear heat and guide phlegm; however, predecessors often used sedatives to calm the heart. This can treat heat and clear phlegm, but if there is stubborn phlegm that is adhesive, this medicine may not easily eliminate it. In such cases, vomiting must be induced first, and only after that should this medicine be taken. If phlegm is indeed inside, it must also be expelled, adjusted according to the severity of the illness.</p>
<p>Jie Gu stated: If there are external phlegm and fever with a sound, brew a decoction of rhubarb and schizonepeta, and take the Five Colors Pill. </p>
<p>For intermittent heat accumulation, the Peach Branch Pill is the main treatment. If the fever persists, use a decoction of Earth Bone Skin to take the Five Colors Pill. </p>
<p>For wind-heat, use a decoction of Siler and Scutellaria, and then take the large green ointment. </p>
<p>If the body is warm but not hot, use the White Tiger Decoction with Atractylodes, and take the Five Colors Pill.</p>
<p>For wind convulsions, it is stated: First use phlegm-dissolving medicine to clear the chest and open the orifices, calming the spirit, and only then take the medicine for wind convulsions. It is also said: First use the wind-dissolving pill to remove the wind heat, then take the Extinguish Soul Powder to stabilize the convulsions.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br><strong>Seizures</strong></p>
<p>The mouth states: First, harmonize the three Jiao, clear heat to relieve the seizure, calm the spirit and stabilize intention, regulate the internal organs, warm and transform phlegm, and then administer the remedies for seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of the Condition</strong></p>
<p>In children with seizures, the eyes are straight and silent, do not turn, appear cloudy, lips are dark, pupils twitch, there is a bluish-black hue around the eyes, the face is pale and the fingers are dark, saliva foams from the mouth like white pus, the mouth is locked with abdominal distension preventing nursing, the throat emits a sound like a saw. They sleep excessively and cannot nurse, their body feels hot with bleeding, they remain unresponsive, experience hollow rumbling in the abdomen, lips are reversed and painful, vomiting and diarrhea are incessant, profuse sweating accompanies severe heat, they lie down for too long without sleeping, and their body becomes rigid. An adult can fit a hand under their back, a child can fit three fingers, and these conditions are untreatable.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for Clothing and Seizing Empty Space</strong></p>
<p>Searching for clothing and seizing empty space is attributed by Xu Shuwei to liver heat. The liver governs the tendons; when the tendons and vessels are withered and wind is drawn in, the fingers may clasp tightly, thus it is advisable to take Liuwei Dihuang Wan, which has the potential for restoration. Qian Zhongyang uses Xieqing Wan, which treats excess heat in the liver channel, as searching for clothing and seizing empty space are symptoms of failure post-illness. However, if one seeks out true excess heat, there is rarely any to be found, and the practitioner must discern it carefully. Wang Haizang’s treatise addresses blood loss with symptoms of searching for clothing, seizing empty space, touching the bed, hands waving, head shaking, disjointed speech, irregular and floating pulse, internal agitation due to blood loss, extreme heat, and coarse breath with dry nose; this is difficult to treat, and Sheng Dihuang and Huang Lian Decoction should be prescribed.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br><strong>Stunned Paralysis in the Crane&#39;s Knee</strong></p>
<p>The liver corresponds to the eastern green dragon wood; its movement responds to the wind, and when ill, it signifies shock and fright. Various heat conditions can provoke liver wind; if there is wind, phlegm arises, and with phlegm comes convulsions. During a child’s seizure, hands and feet may twitch—one should allow the child to find their own rhythm before intervening to avoid creating other symptoms. If parents, seeing the alarming state of their child, restrain them, they fail to realize that the tendons are linked to the liver. When an illness strikes, if the hands and feet are held down, the tendons cannot relax, leading the meridians to be blocked by wind, ultimately resulting in the child becoming incapacitated. The Inner Classic states that stubborn weakness is called &quot;slow wind,&quot; and heavy pain is known as &quot;damp obstruction.&quot; Additionally, there are instances of paralysis, numbness, and unbearable swelling and pain in the extremities, caused by the noxious energy of wind. Hence, it is said: &quot;Wind corrupting the extremities results in this.&quot; Common signs in children include irregular palpitations and swelling pain throughout the body, or uncoordinated limbs; these are signs of stunned paralysis. If treatment is delayed, lumps may form between the joints of the arms, wrists, knees, and shins, or the knees may swell, with flesh wasting away to reveal bone, resembling a crane&#39;s knee. This condition is termed &quot;crane&#39;s knee syndrome&quot;.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>The above symptoms suggest that it is advisable to first induce sweating, allowing the pores to open, which can eliminate wind-heat and also expel any dampness. One can use Baijiesan (Hundred Resolutions Powder) combined with Wuling San (Five-Dragon Powder), doubling the quantity of Ma Huang (Ephedra), and decoct it with ginger and scallions. If a slight sweating is achieved, that is sufficient. Alternatively, Ma Huang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) for dispersion is even better. The next options include Fangji Tang (Stephania Decoction), Qufeng San (Wind-Dispelling Powder), and Duhuo Tang (Duhuo Decoction), adding Sangjisheng (Mulberry Mistletoe) for intake, along with Fangfeng Tang (Siler Decoction) or Heihudan (Black Tiger Dan) made into small pills taken intermittently, to prevent the generation of wind and phlegm, thus making recovery easier. For severe pain from paralysis or abscesses, use half raw and half stir-fried Qian Niu Zi (Plantago Seeds), slightly crushed and decocted. Mix it with Wuling San using some wine to remove the cold dampness from flowing collaterals, which can reduce swelling and toxins.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>If the major organs are closed and not functioning, it is due to wind-heat accumulated internally. In this case, the right cheek becomes red and purple, and the three pulses in the right hand are floating and solidly slippery. It is advisable to use Wuhuo Decoction or Danggui Powder, or Zhiqiao Pill for treatment. The method of addition and subtraction in prescriptions should be especially based on careful judgment; if one rigidly adheres to one method, he is not a good doctor. It is also recommended to intermittently take Decoction to Disperse Wind.</p>
<p>Xue&#39;s commentary states: The condition known as &quot;crane knee wind&quot; leads to gradually thinner legs and thicker knees, resembling a crane&#39;s knee, hence the name. This is due to insufficient kidney qi, with external pathogens causing the ailment. Initially, there may be pain inside the knee with no change in color outside, and difficulty in bending and stretching. If it develops into swelling, with red color and pus within one or two months, it can be treated; however, if it is hard, white, and does not develop pus, it is difficult to treat. For early onset, use Dafenfeng Decoction as the main treatment, supplemented with Yiqi Yangrong Decoction; for cases with pus, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction as the main treatment, supplemented with Dafenfeng Decoction. Avoid using medicines like Shixuan Liqi, and if symptoms like fever or non-abscessing persist, it&#39;s necessary to adjust and tonify the spleen and stomach appropriately, otherwise, it will surely lead to complications.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Ancient and Modern Texts on Medicine, Volume 428</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section on Children&#39;s Epileptic Seizures</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Pediatric Health [Author Unknown, Song Dynasty]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epileptic Seizures with Teeth Grinding</strong></p>
<p>When children experience seizures, if they grind their teeth without pause, or if they have previously had seizures and still tend to grind their teeth, I once treated a child of a physician named Li who had such symptoms. I consulted several doctors, and some suggested that this was due to &quot;fright entering the kidneys.&quot; This notion derives from a line in a song by the Master Wang of Jiayue, which states, &quot;grinding teeth in sleep fright enters the kidneys.&quot; This implies that teeth are related to bones, and bones are related to the kidneys; hence it was said this way. However, this is often repeated without evidence; there are no records in ancient texts, nor is there any principle that supports &quot;fright entering the kidneys,&quot; and indeed, the use of medications has proven ineffective.</p>
<p>Now, upon careful examination of the symptoms, I clarify that this represents a disease of the Foot Yangming channel. The Foot Yangming is the channel of the stomach, originating at the nose, crossing the cheeks, entering the teeth, and returning to exit around the lips, descending to intersect with the jaw, and finally exiting at the Great Welcome point, following the cheekbones. Moreover, the act of seizing is due to wind; wind is associated with wood, while the stomach is associated with earth. Wood can control earth, thus when teeth are afflicted by wind, they become itchy, and the cheekbone region, affected by external pathogens, becomes tense, causing the child to grind their teeth constantly to alleviate the urgency in the cheek area and relieve the itchiness of the teeth. Therefore, treatment should focus on dispelling wind from the stomach.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br><strong>Dark Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Dark convulsions resemble shocking convulsions and also resemble stroke-related spasms. When an episode occurs, it comes on suddenly, causing the person to collapse, with their mind troubled and spirits confused, thoughts muddled and breath disordered. The hands and feet twitch, and there may be spasms, with a gurgling sound in the throat, sometimes resulting in the expulsion of phlegm or yelling. The pulse exhibits an intensity of both yin and yang. The episodes can last a whole day or half a day if they are distant, and for one or two hours if they are closer. After the attack, the person gets up as if they were not ill, commonly referred to as convulsive disease; those with milder symptoms are called dark wind. The ancients also said: in mild cases, the attack is called shock; in severe cases, it is called convulsion. Mild cases have frail and weak qi and blood, making them easily affected and causing more injuries; severe cases have strong qi and blood, making them more resilient and suffering less.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Symptoms of Shock Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>For children with shocking convulsions, once the attack settles, there may be residual symptoms that do not subside. Although the main condition may have ceased, the underlying issue remains. This can occur due to excessive intake of hot or cold medicine or improper use of purging treatments, causing the convulsions and residual symptoms to persist.</p>
<p><strong>Shock Convulsions Accompanied by Other Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>In children with prolonged convulsions, all five organs become deficient and are impacted by the illness. When an episode occurs, it affects the heart&#39;s blood, the lung&#39;s qi, the liver&#39;s spasms, the spleen&#39;s confusion, and the kidney&#39;s cold. There may also be cases where deficiency causes other illnesses to arise or where other illnesses provoke shocking convulsions; some cases may require a combination of treatments to address both conditions.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br><strong>Immediate and Delayed Shock</strong></p>
<p>Shock can be immediate or delayed, indicating different underlying conditions. Immediate shock may be caused by a cold or fever, improper digestion, sudden sights or sounds, or physical falls. When shocked, the liver becomes affected, leading to internal wind pathogens causing disturbances, with fire fueled by this wind. The interplay of wind and fire results in symptoms such as convulsions, shaking of the head, protrusion of the tongue, and excessive drooling due to blockage. After a while, the person may return to their original state. The pulse becomes rapid, floating, tight, and urgent due to the violent nature of wind and fire.</p>
<p>Qian suggests that there are symptoms without yin involvement. This is because the heart&#39;s heat is excessive, and the yin cannot balance the yang, indicating an excess of yang and insufficiency of yin. In cases of phlegm accumulation, use a diluted saliva powder to clear the phlegm, followed by Qingxian Pills, Lijin Pills, or Zhenjing Pills to dispel liver wind and reduce heart fire. If the mouth is unable to open for swallowing, administer through the nose, loosening the jaw slightly, and use emetic medicines as necessary. For phlegm that cannot be expelled, use bamboo juice or ginger juice to induce vomiting. Alternatively, use Xiaoniuhuang Pills or Gunping Pills to expel the phlegm, while identifying the specific cause for treatment. If the shock is due to overeating, remedy the food stagnation; if from exposure to wind or cold, dispel the pathogen; if caused by fear or shock, calm the heart, avoiding a one-size-fits-all shock treatment.</p>
<p>If the shock persists without awakening, urgently stimulate the nose with a sneezing powder or crumpled paper. If there are no sneezes, or if the person cannot cry out, the mouth is rigid and unresponsive, sweat beads on the forehead, and there is involuntary urination—the signs are indicative of imminent death.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>Slow fright occurs from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, or due to prolonged illness leading to deficiency in both the spleen and lungs. As a result, the liver wood flows unchecked, and the earth is overrun by wind and wood, causing a state of fright. It manifests as convulsions that aren’t severe, resembling sleep but not a stable slumber, with a pale face and a cold body. When in sleep, the eyes may remain open, and the limbs along with the breath in the mouth and nose are all cold. The pulse is deep, slow, weak, and failing, which the Qian family identifies as a sign of yang deficiency. This is primarily due to significant deficiency in the spleen earth, where yang cannot overcome yin, indicating a condition of excess yin and deficiency of yang. The treatment should focus on warming and supplementing the spleen and stomach. The presence of phlegm and fluid is also caused by the spleen and stomach&#39;s inability to transform and transport, and must not be abruptly removed. Even when there are convulsive episodes, they result from the weakness of spleen earth inviting the wood to conquer and must not be treated by stopping wind. Slow fright essentially lacks heat; even if there is an occurrence of fever, it is still virtual heat. One must avoid cooling treatments for fright, and only warm and supplement the spleen and stomach will allow the liver wood to find peace.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>It is like soil being thin yet having a large tree on top; it cannot bear the weight, and thus moves by itself without the wind. If the soil is thickly cultivated, allowing the roots to deepen and the foundation to be solid, then it will naturally be free from harm even in the absence of wind. It is also necessary to compare the subtle balance of yin and yang when using medicine. If the case is a lingering one and there is still a yang sign, there is no need to restore yang; rather, one should use a different formula to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach, slightly adding ingredients like Gastrodia, Scorpion, White Aconite, and Bile Star to counteract wind and stabilize convulsions. If yang is diminished and yin is excessive, with a cool body and a pale face, purely a case of lingering fright, it is advisable to use a modified formula of Atractylodes and White Aconite, or a modified Yang-restoring powder. If the limbs are cold and the two excretions are uncontrollable, with hair standing on end, head shaking, eyes not turning, foaming at the mouth with a crow-like sound, this indicates a fatal condition.</p>
<p>In general, for fright, do not use drugs that tranquilize and dissolve phlegm; instead, one should calm the spirit and nourish the heart. The reason is that fright is due to insufficient heart energy; the more it is forced down, the more it becomes vacuous. If phlegm and fright permeate into the emptiness, then treatment is impossible.</p>
<p>Regarding fetal fright:</p>
<p>In the first hundred days after a child is born, if there is no fright or fear but there are convulsions that occur intermittently, or if the child locks their eyes and mouth, or has excessive drooling and vomiting, or clenches their fists with a strong body, this is termed fetal fright. First, use the Fright-Relieving Pills, and then use the Embracing Dragon Pills.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br><strong>Twitching</strong></p>
<p>Twitching occurs due to heat and phlegm stagnating in the chest and abdomen, with wind and fire alternating, thus causing the limbs to convulse. When twitching occurs, if a man looks left without sound and right with sound, and a woman looks right without sound and left with sound, this is due to the conflict between metal and wood. If there is a “Mu Lian Zha” symptom, it arises from internal liver wind stirring upwards into the eyes. If the eyes are straight and looking, this is due to heat entering the eyes, pulling the muscles and veins, causing tightness in both corners, preventing turning and glancing. If twitching is triggered by sudden fright or wind epilepsy, it is advisable to use “Jing Wan” or “Gun Tan Wan,” both prepared with peppermint, gastrodia, and uncarried vine decoction. </p>
<p>If there are symptoms after vomiting or diarrhea, it indicates a deficiency of the spleen and stomach. When there is no wind to dispel, and no phlegm to eliminate, it is recommended to use “Liu Jun Zi” decoction with added gastrodia, uncarried vine, peony, wood fragrance, and seele, to regulate the liver and tonify the spleen. If yang energy has sunk, the “Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang” with ginger and cinnamon should be added. For a deficiency of yang energy, use “Shen Fu Tang.” </p>
<p>Should twitching occur due to food stagnation and phlegm accumulation, leading to this manifestation, it signifies that the spleen is weak and cannot generate metal, thus metal is deficient and cannot control wood, which causes wood&#39;s disturbances. One should strengthen the spleen and aid digestion; the symptoms will naturally resolve and should not use cooling sedatives and such medications. Generally, if twitching is frequent, it indicates wind on the surface, which is easy to treat and can be dispersed. If twitching is rare, it indicates wind is within the organs and is difficult to treat; thus, spleen tonification is required.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>Heavenly fishing is due to heat accumulation in the heart and lungs, characterized by drooling, convulsions, neck stiffness, phlegm sounds, eyes rolling upwards, and nails turning blue, all caused by phlegm-heat obstructing the upper body. One should first use the &quot;Rolling Phlegm Pill&quot; to eliminate the accumulated heat and phlegm, and then apply &quot;Cooling Diaphragm Powder,&quot; adjusting treatment according to deficiency and excess.</p>
<p>Internal fishing is due to deficiency and cold of the spleen and stomach, where cold constricts. Therefore, it leads to stooping, painful abdomen, frequent crying, and dark lips with cysts. It is advisable to use &quot;Regulating Middle Decoction&quot; combined with Assafoetida, Evodia, and Cinnamon.</p>
<p>Regarding the correspondence of cold-induced fevers with frightful convulsions: A student asked, &quot;Although the condition of frightful convulsions is not found in ancient texts, it has been handed down for thousands of years. While my teacher refutes the errors, the stubborn ones still have doubts. Please clarify this to enlighten the deaf and mute!&quot; The teacher replied: &quot;This question is indeed not insignificant. I aim to break the confusion for the younger generation, thus dispelling the misunderstandings thereafter. Infants and young children, whose muscles, bones, organs, and blood vessels are not yet fully developed, have an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin, unlike a matured body of seven feet where yin and yang are balanced. Therefore, with insufficient yin and excess yang, it is easy for internal heat to arise, and when heat is abundant, phlegm, wind, and fright occur, which is consistent. If there had been a name assigned to it as &#39;heat phlegm wind fright&#39; back in the day, people would not be confused. As it was inconvenient to attach four characters, only two were dropped, leading to &#39;fright&#39; at the beginning and &#39;wind&#39; at the end, and later generations did not understand, thus considering it a peculiar disease.&quot;<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>This illness is said to have eight signs; it is characterized by head shaking and hand movements, which are named &quot;pulling and twitching.&quot; Due to sudden mouth closure and urgent leg spasms, it is referred to as &quot;disturbed sight and chaotic heart.&quot; The stiffness of the spine and backward bending of the back result in the name &quot;curved bow.&quot; As time has passed, this has become a long-standing belief, and upon encountering such symptoms, people invariably find them remarkable. However, they do not realize that children&#39;s pores are not dense, making them susceptible to catching wind and cold. Those affected by wind and cold must first invade the Taiyang channel, whose pathway begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses the forehead, enters the brain, and exits at the nape of the neck, joining the spine and reaching the waist. Therefore, when ill, the tendons and meridians are strained, giving rise to all sorts of names for these &quot;pulling, twitching, and curved bow&quot; symptoms. They mistakenly use harsh drugs to suppress external pathogens, deeply invading the organs, often leading to death in countless instances. Occasionally, those with strong constitutions and light symptoms recover, which is then mistakenly regarded as a miraculous recovery. Consequently, they safeguard their fleeting experiences, unaware that they are harming many children daily without recognizing their guilt. In a hundred years or over vast distances, a few wise individuals may emerge, yet they are ultimately unable to resolve all doubts.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>In certain writings, it is said that children under the age of eight do not suffer from typhoid fever. Such statements are nonsensical and surprisingly come from knowledgeable individuals, serving to support the mistaken belief in &quot;wind disturbances.&quot; It is not considered that children are not resistant to typhoid fever; once they catch a cold with solar influence, they already have strong bodies and sweat a lot, their tendons and pulses are affected, and they become drowsy—by this point they are already suffering from the core illness. Randomly administering herbal remedies can lead to death in quick succession, which prevents any understanding of the transmission of the illness. This is why some claim that children do not experience typhoid fever.</p>
<p>It is not recognized that children are more susceptible to external factors and prone to fevers, with typhoid fever being especially common, mistakenly thought as &quot;wind disturbance&quot; by many. For children, it is crucial to recover from typhoid fever within three days; if one waits until the illness has fully developed, endurance will certainly fail. Additionally, there are differences in symptoms: rigid convulsions occur without sweating, while soft convulsions include sweating. Children more often experience soft convulsions than rigid ones. Physicians, upon noticing excessive sweating and a muddled consciousness, often misdiagnose this as chronic wind disturbance and use herbs like ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes to close the pores, preventing the heat pathogen from exiting, which is also greatly harmful, though somewhat less so than using stronger medicinal substances.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>Therefore, when treating the fevers of young children, one should focus on clearing the exterior and not reinforce the interior. Zhang Zhongjing originally had the Gui Zhi formula; if it is abandoned and alternative treatments from the Dongyuan are pursued, even the smallest error can lead to great deviations and thus requires meticulous attention. Furthermore, postpartum women who lose excessive blood may experience symptoms of yin deficiency and yang excess, presenting with cold and fever, resembling those of young children. Physicians often mistakenly treat this as &quot;postpartum wind,&quot; a notion that is particularly laughable. It is important to understand that my approach to dispelling wind does not imply there is no &quot;wind disease.&quot; Children are timid and weak in spirit; when they encounter strange sights or sounds or suddenly fall, they become frightened. Their faces may turn pale, and they may become overly fussy and cry excessively. This is different from being obstructed by heat evil, where the spirit becomes clouded, and they do not respond to loud noises such as bells or gunshots. A thorough examination will reveal the errors in confusing the symptoms of wind with those of other conditions. </p>
<p>Since the younger generation comes to my door, they are guided by the light of superior principles, invigorating their lungs and intestines. Suddenly, they gain profound understanding, akin to drinking from a deep pool. However, if one only seeks resolution from the text, many important teachings will remain uncommunicated.</p>
<p><strong>Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s bodies are delicate and their spirits timid; they do not withstand external strong heat, which often leads to convulsions. Later generations have recklessly named these &quot;wind&quot; without understanding, creating a confused theory with four signs and eight symptoms. In reality, the head shaking and hand stiffness in convulsions indicate the spasms of &quot;wind,&quot; and the extreme arching of the neck and back signifies the arched response to &quot;wind.&quot; Many pediatricians uniformly accept this diagnosis, but families often passively tolerate external harmful influences. Instead of treating these with appropriate remedies, they resort to harsh medicines like minerals, which cause many deaths without remorse.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: When children have epilepsy, it is due to insufficient blood and qi, and their spirit is not fully formed. It may also be caused by the invasion of pathogenic wind or by shock and fright. There are cases where it arises from emotional disturbances during pregnancy. If the eyes stare straight, the mouth is shut and saliva flows, the abdomen is distended with convulsions, the neck and back arch, the waist and spine are rigid, and the body appears lifeless, remaining unresponsive all day, this is termed &quot;zhen&quot; (a severe type of epilepsy). </p>
<p>In treating the five types of epilepsy, it is essential to follow the principles of the corresponding organs. Each organ is associated with a specific animal form, and the primary treatment involves the use of five-colored pills, supplemented with medicinal herbs from the respective meridians. If the seizures are severe, death may occur. If the patient exhibits a flushed face and bulging eyes, sticks out the tongue, bites the lips, and experiences palpitation and shortness of breath with a voice that sounds like a goat, this is called &quot;xin xian&quot; (heart epilepsy). For blood deficiency, use the Heart Nourishing Decoction; if there is heat caused by drinking cold fluids, use Tiger Eye Pills for real heat; if the heat arises from drinking soup, apply the Pure Cinnabar Fragrance Pill for false heat.</p>
<p>If the face is green, the lips are blue, the eyes protrude, the limbs are stiff and twisted with a voice resembling a dog, this is termed &quot;gan xian&quot; (liver epilepsy). For liver deficiency, use the Rehmannia Pill; if there is strong convulsing, use Chai Hu to clear the liver; if there is constipation, use the Blue Purging Pill. If the face is black, the eyes vibrate, there is drooling, the body appears like a corpse, and the voice resembles a pig, this is called &quot;shen xian&quot; (kidney epilepsy). Use Rehmannia Pills or similar remedies for treatment, as the kidney has no purging methods and should be treated directly for deficiency.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>The face resembles withered bones, the eyes look up in shock, the person jumps and twists, shakes their head and drools, making a sound like a chicken; this is known as lung convulsion. For those with weak lung qi, use the Lung Supplement Powder; if the face is pale and yellow, indicating that the earth cannot produce, use the Five Flavor Distinctive Function Powder; if the face is red, it indicates that yin fire is rising to the lungs, use the Rehmannia Pill. If the face is withered and yellow, the eyes are straight and the abdomen is distended, with involuntary diarrhea and a voice like that of an ox, this is known as spleen convulsion, use the Five Flavor Distinctive Function Powder. If the face is green, with diarrhea and little appetite, use the Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with added Mu Xiang and Chai Hu. If there is fever and convulsions, lying on the back, the face has a glossy sheen, and the pulse is floating, the illness is in the bowels, representing a yang condition, easy to treat. If the body is cold and there are no spasms, lying face down, the face is dark, and the pulse is sinking, the illness is in the organs, representing a yin condition, difficult to treat. For any of these symptoms, it is best first to examine the ears and the area above the cheekbones; if there are blue vein patterns, lance them to draw blood, which can avert suffering. All these indicate a deficiency of vital energy; one should primarily use the Purple River Horse Pill and assist with nourishing medicines. If one recklessly exhausts and injures the vital energy, this will inevitably lead to recurring attacks, and over time to life-threatening conditions, often resulting in inability to be saved. There are also three types of convulsions: fright convulsion, wind convulsion, and food convulsion. For fright convulsion, use Jing Pill, Fuling Pill, Qian&#39;s Heart Nourishing Decoction, Chen Mercury Aromatic Powder, Qing Shen Decoction, or Hu Jing Pill. For wind convulsion, use Qian&#39;s Niu Huang Pill, Xiaofeng Pill, or Xing Su Powder. For food convulsion, use Miaosheng Pill.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br><strong>Astonishing Wind</strong></p>
<p>The key points of astonishing wind comprise two: one is substantive evidence, and the other is insubstantial evidence. For acute astonishment, it is a yang condition, a substantive evidence, where the excess of liver evil generates heat, and heat predominates phlegm. When phlegm-heat invades the heart and diaphragm, wind and fire clash, leading to urgent and violent manifestations and an abundance of phlegm-heat. This is termed acute astonishment, which should first treat the symptoms and then address the root cause. As for chronic astonishment, it pertains to yin, being an insubstantial condition, where both spleen and lungs are deficient, and liver evil is unconstrained, thus undermining the spleen and generating wind. This is without yang symptoms, hence the condition presents with both energy and spirit deficiency, categorized as chronic astonishment. Here, one ought to focus on rescuing the original energy of the spleen and kidneys. </p>
<p>Although both are termed astonishing wind, the differences between substantial and insubstantial are distinct, which is why the names acute and chronic vary. In treating this, one must not overlook the names to understand their meanings. </p>
<p>In children, astonishing wind indicates liver disease but also involves spleen, kidney, heart, and lung diseases. Children have insufficient true yin, and their softness fails to overcome rigidity, making liver evil easy to activate. When liver evil stirs, wood can generate fire, fire can generate wind, and when wind and heat clash, blood becomes deficient. Blood deficiency leads to tight muscles; tight muscles result in symptoms like convulsions, dizziness, and extreme rigidity, all of which root back to the fundamental issues of the liver wood.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>When the elements are displaced, if wood disrupts earth, it causes spleen disease resulting in phlegm, vomiting, and diarrhea; when wood flourishes and metal declines, it leads to lung disease resulting in wheezing and shortness of breath; when wood-fire rises, it causes heart disease manifesting as agitation and restlessness; when wood-fire harms yin, it leads to kidney disease resulting in dry water, blood dryness, liver thirst, inability to sweat, convulsions, and spasms. This is essentially the general concept of wind diseases affecting the five zang organs. </p>
<p>To treat this, there are essential principles. First is wind, second is fire, third is phlegm, fourth is yang deficiency, and fifth is yin deficiency. If one can discern these urgent issues, they can be thoroughly addressed. The term &quot;wind&quot; refers to its strong, rigid, and dizzying effects, all linked to liver wood; hence it is called &quot;startling wind and heat.&quot; This is not an external pathogen, and many today do not understand this meaning, believing that treating wind must always involve dispersants. They do not realize that while external wind can be dispersed, the wind from blood dryness cannot. </p>
<p>Thus, herbs like Fangfeng, Jingjie, Qianghuo, Duhuo, Xixin, Gancao, Chaihu, Zisu, and Bohe should only be used when there are signs of external pathogens causing fever without sweating. If there is no external pathogen, they should be avoided; caution is essential when using dispersants. As for phlegm-fire, phlegm condenses and blocks qi, while excessive fire depletes yin; this is the root of the pathogen. If phlegm arises due to fire, treat the fire first; if fire is retained due to phlegm, then focus on eliminating the phlegm.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>For excess fire, one should favor herbs such as gentian, gardenia, yellow bitter, yellow bracken, gypsum, and rhubarb. For mild fire, one should prefer herbs like scutellaria, anemarrhena, original ginseng, dendrobium, earth bone peel, akebia, and gastrodia. For excessive phlegm, one should use herbs such as cattle gall, gall bladder stone, turmeric, south star, pinellia, and white mustard seed. For mild phlegm, one should choose herbs like dried tangerine peel, radix peucedani, sea stone, fritillaria, and balloon flower powder.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the color of vermilion is red and heavy, it can enter the heart to calm fright; containing mercury, it effectively clears channels and eliminates phlegm while lowering fire. The strong aroma and taste of realgar can break up stagnation and reach obstruction directly. Borneol and musk are essential medicines for opening the orifices. Amber and indigo are merely assistive agents for clearing and benefiting. </p>
<p>Also, worms like silkworms, scorpions, and cicada sloughs are said to treat wind. The silkworm has a salty and spicy flavor, greatly capable of opening phlegm and breaking stagnant energy. Using phlegm-removing medicines effectively eliminates the evil from the liver and spleen; when the evil is gone, the liver regulates, which is indeed the treatment for wind. The scorpion, which originates in the northeast and has a green color associated with wood, is good for treating contrived conditions. Combined with its salty taste, it helps reduce phlegm and is thus also categorized under wind treatment, although it is secondary to the silkworm. </p>
<p>The cicada slough has a light and thin nature, primarily to derive its meaning of clearing and shedding light; without substantial efficacy, it is not something to rely on. In general, for wind disturbances, phlegm-fire is the most substantial, followed by wind.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>The method of treating the real (diseases) stops here. However, diseases of false and real (conditions) are easily controlled, while the principal defeats must be in danger. Indeed, if yang is deficient, then the yin pathogens do not disperse, and the original qi does not recover; if yin is deficient, then the nutritive qi cannot circulate, and where does the essence and blood come from? Thus, the gravitas of wind fright in heavy cases lies significantly in deficiency. Without deficiency, there is no heaviness; without depletion, there is no danger. The original essence and original qi stand in mutual support; one should not prioritize one over the other. Therefore, the method of treating deficiency must differentiate between yin and yang. For yang deficiency, one should use dryness and rigidity; for yin deficiency, one should use warmth and moistening. However, those skilled in using yang find that within the qi there is naturally water; those skilled in using yin find that within the water there is naturally qi. The subtlety of creation requires mutual reliance, thus there are aspects that cannot be confused and aspects that cannot be separated. If someone claims this is not a medicine for children, nor a remedy for wind fright, could it be that the disease of wind fright does not pertain to yin and yang, and that the body of the child does not rely on blood and qi? As for humans, one can see the heart as soon as they open their mouth; how can we not discuss the unity of heaven and earth? </p>
<p>The diseases of wind fright manifest as rigidity, convulsions, and other ailments. In the classic concerning meridians and tendons, it states: &quot;The disease of the foot&#39;s lesser yin tendon involves cramps in the foot, along with painful nodules in the path it takes.&quot; If the disease is here, it presides over epilepsy and spasms. Those afflicted externally cannot bend, while internally they cannot look up. Hence, those suffering from yang illnesses bend backward and cannot bow, while those with yin illnesses cannot look up. Furthermore, it is stated: &quot;The disease of meridians and tendons, when cold, causes them to bend backward and tighten; when hot, causes them to loosen and not contract; in yin atrophy, they do not function.&quot; In yang urgency, they bend backward; in yin urgency, they cannot extend upwards.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br><strong>Acute Wind Shock</strong></p>
<p>In the case of acute wind shock, there is strong heat and phlegm obstruction, with a narrowed gaze and a paralyzed expression, twitching and trembling, tightness of the jaw, heat in the mouth, flushed cheeks and red lips, cold drinks causing constipation, and a deep and rapid pulse. This indicates an invasion of the liver by wind-heat, associated with excess yang and deficiency of yin. </p>
<p>The treatment for this should consider the urgency. For any significant presence of pathogens, it is essential to first address the superficial symptoms. If phlegm is severe and there is urgent wheezing, one should use prescriptions like Baolong Pill, Amber Powder, Qingge Decoction, or Meihua Drink. If there is excessive fire causing agitation and heat, it is advisable to use Lianjie Pill, Yiqing Pill, or Huanglian Anshen Pill, as well as herbs such as Gardenia, Huanglian, or Gentian. </p>
<p>If there is intense heat and dryness leading to severe constipation, one should use Xieqing Pill. Alternatively, one may prepare it as a decoction or use Lijiang Pill as well. If there is external wind-cold accompanying fever and shock, it should be resolved at the surface, using Yihansan with an increased amount of Chaihu, or choosing from Shen Su Decoction, Wujisan, or Xingsu Powder. If the superficial evil has not been resolved but there is also internal heat, one should use Qian’s Huanglong Decoction. If the wind shock starts to recede but fire remains, one should use Anshen Zhengjing Pill.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>Everything mentioned above consists of urgent methods to treat the symptoms, primarily aimed at reducing phlegm and fire. One should then adjust and supplement blood and qi, as outlined in the methods attributed to Xue, or employ gradual treatments for sudden fright to prevent weakness. This is the most essential practice in pediatrics. Previous sages have said: Children are easily affected by deficiency and excess, and the use of aggressive medications should cease as soon as the illness is identified; excessive dosing is indeed a true statement. Generally, these conditions often pertain to the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys, with deficiency in yin and dryness in blood, mixed with wind and fire. If one neglects yin and excessively uses medications to expel wind and transform phlegm, the spleen will become more deficient, and the blood will become drier, allowing pathogenic energy to linger, which will inevitably lead to chronic fright.</p>
<p>Luo Quanshan said: Sudden fright pertains to the fullness of wood, fire, and earth. When wood is full, there are spasms with efficacy, and frequent eye movement with rapid blinking; when earth is full, there is body heat and a red face without vomiting or diarrhea, with the child lying still with eyes closed. The treatment should cool and drain, using cooling and calming pills. There are also cases where fright induces symptoms like clenched jaws and intense heat—here, there is both internal heat and external wind, so one must interrupt the wind and stabilize the spasms. If phlegm heat is still strong, it is advisable to slightly purge it; once the phlegm heat is relieved, one should urgently nourish and support the stomach qi; when spasms are stabilized and phlegm heat has receded, one ought to adjust and supplement spleen qi.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br><strong>Slow Fright</strong></p>
<p>The condition of slow fright is often caused by vomiting and diarrhea, leading to a weak qi and sluggish spirit, drowsiness with eyes half-open, phlegm sounds and quickened breathing, sudden startles and convulsions, either sporadic episodes or alternating between feelings of cold and heat, or having limbs that feel unusually cold, or lips and brows appearing blue or red, with a pale complexion. However, the pulse is slow and weak, or may be thin and rapid. This indicates wind arising from spleen deficiency, without signs of yang. The slow fright condition in children often results from illness or from vomiting and diarrhea, or from the inappropriate use of medicinal herbs which harms the spleen and stomach. Yet, some children may inherently have weak spleen and stomach, or suffer from wind and cold; such conditions do not necessarily arise from past illnesses or inappropriate medication, and are all related to deficiency and cold in the spleen and kidney. </p>
<p>To treat slow fright, one must quickly nurture the essential qi; conditions like wind and phlegm are not actual evils, and one must not recklessly disperse them, as this could further damage the yang qi, leading to irretrievable consequences. In cases of slight spleen deficiency with mild diarrhea, and with no internal cold, one can tonify gently with formulas like Liu Shen San, Si Jun Zi Tang, or Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If both spleen and kidney are deficient yet the organs show no cold, Wu Fu Yin is appropriate. Moreover, since yin blood originates from the spleen, it is advisable to add Dang Gui and Zao Ren to Si Jun Zi Tang. If the spleen qi is weak and slightly cold, warming formulas like Wen Wei Yin, Li Zhong Tang, or Wu Jun Zi Jian should be recommended.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>For individuals with spleen qi deficiency, cold nature, and excessive phlegm, it is advisable to use Liujunzi Decoction or JInshuiliujun Decoction. If both the spleen and kidney are deficient in yin and also cold, the best option is Liyi Decoction. In cases of severe spleen and kidney deficiency with persistent vomiting or diarrhea, one should use Fuzili Yi Decoction; if the situation is even more severe, consider Liuw Wei Huanyang Decoction or Siwei Huanyang Decoction, adjusting the dosage based on the child&#39;s size. For continuous diarrhea due to spleen and kidney deficiency and cold, Weguang Decoction is indicated.</p>
<p>Frequent and sudden fright episodes, and repeated use of purgatives can lead to spleen damage and yin exhaustion, which may transform the condition into chronic fright. It is essential to tonify the spleen, nourish the blood, and supplement with calming herbs to clear the lungs and control the wood element. I suspect that many previous symptoms arise from a deficiency in the spleen and stomach being overcome by the liver&#39;s wood, with external heat manifesting while retaining internal cold. In such cases, using Wuwu Yigong Powder with added Dong Quai, and supporting with Diaoteng Decoction to replenish spleen earth and balance liver wood, also proves effective. If there is no response, add Jiang and Muxiang to warm and tonify the spleen. If that still does not help, promptly include Fuzil to restore yang. However, using drugs to expel wind and resolve phlegm could exacerbate the risk.</p>
<p>I believe Fuzil, known for its warming and yang-restoring properties, is an excellent remedy for chronic fright. If the vital energy is significantly depleted, using it urgently in a processed form is advisable. For severe energy collapse, immediate administration of processed Fuzil is necessary.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>Great Shock and Sudden Fear</p>
<p>A child suddenly experiences great shock, which most severely harms the heart&#39;s spirit. The text states: &quot;Great shock and sudden fear lead to the separation of qi and blood, the disruption of yin and yang, blockage of the meridians, and the obstruction of pulse pathways, causing yin and yang to clash and the meridians to become empty. The blood and qi lose their order and deviate from their norm.&quot; This is how the book &quot;Inner Canon&quot; describes the illness caused by shock. Moreover, the impact on a child is far greater than that on an adult. If a child experiences great shock, their spirit and qi are scattered, resulting in chaos and disorder; how can there be any substantial condition present? At such a time, restoring the proper qi is already a daunting task; how can we expect to clear and disperse? Just like substances such as vermilion and amber, they merely carry the idea of weighty calming effects but are not a fundamental cure.</p>
<p>Currently, various pediatric texts all treat the symptoms of great shock uniformly with urgent shock treatment, which is a significant mistake. They fail to understand that urgent shock and slow shock arise from different causes: one from wind-heat and the other from deficiencies of the spleen and kidneys. These should not necessarily be attributed to shock alone. The suffering caused by shock resulting in exhaustion comes from a true injury to the heart and spirit, which leads to the rapid scattering of the qi; thus, the reasons and conditions differ greatly, and one cannot speak of them in the same way.</p>
<p>To treat the illness of qi scattering due to great shock, the focus should be on recovering the spirit and qi. It is advisable to use calming pills, the Seven Fortune drink, Portulaca decoction, and the Ginseng powder, along with decoctions of substances like gold and silver.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>The symptoms of a child&#39;s frightened crying are different from those of a frightful convulsion, as well as from an intense, sudden fear. This is because a child&#39;s liver energy is yet to be fully developed, and their gallbladder energy is particularly timid. When they hear sudden sounds or see unexpected sights, even if it does not result in intense fear, it can still disturb their spirit and soul. While awake, they may experience this disturbance, and in sleep, they might become startled or restless, sometimes suddenly crying out. These are all symptoms of a timid and unsettled spirit, and the primary treatment should be to calm the spirit and nourish the energy. Suitable remedies include Xiang Shen Decoction, Tuan Shen Powder, Qifu Drink, and Secret Formula An Shen Pill, among others. If there is mild heat present, Sheng Mai Powder is appropriate; if heat is severe, then Zhu Sha An Shen Pill or Dao Chi Powder should be used. Crying with many tears, suddenly starting and stopping, indicates being startled. If crying occurs without tears, with a long but not loud voice, it suggests abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Clonic spasms, known as &quot;chu,&quot; are a form of fright. When they occur violently, they are termed as frightful convulsions; when occurring mildly and slowly, they are called clonic spasms. If clonic spasms are not treated, they can gradually develop into frightful convulsions. Although the writings of Qian and others discuss the seasons and symptoms of the organs for treatment, the unpredictable nature of illness makes it difficult to be constrained by seasonal factors. Instead, it is better to observe the present symptoms and treat according to the condition of the organs. In summary, for a child&#39;s actual symptoms, the causes relate mainly to excess from the east and stagnation in the center. The excess of the east, due to the wood generating fire and wind, leads to heat and fright. The stagnation of the center, due to earth, generates dampness and stagnation, resulting in phlegm and accumulation. Understanding these two aspects provides insight into treating excess conditions. If a child demonstrates deficiency, it can be manifested in the five organs.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>When the heart is deficient, there will be shock and anxiety. When the lungs are deficient, there will be shortness of breath and excessive sweating. When the spleen is deficient, there will be vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, fullness and fatigue in lying down, tightness in the jaw with drooling, and trembling of the hands and feet. When the liver is deficient, there will be tense muscles, dry blood, strong spasms, and squinting eyes. When the kidneys are deficient, there will be incontinence, dryness in the armpits, inability to speak, dizziness, limbs feeling cold and reversed, and fire not returning to its source. Understanding these five conditions allows one to know how to treat deficiency. However, these signs of deficiency and excess can often be confused. By closely observing the physical appearance, voice, pulse, and breath, there will be no situation that cannot be discerned. </p>
<p>For treating excess conditions, one should first address sudden fear; for treating deficiency conditions, one should first address gradual fear. Furthermore, for nighttime crying and other treatment methods, once their essence is fully understood, they should all be examined together. In summary, all that is referred to as excess pertains to pathogenic qi, not to the essence of original qi. Therefore, when treating these conditions, it is crucial not to harm the original qi. If the illness has persisted for a long time, special attention should be paid to the kidney and spleen, ensuring a solid foundation, and thus, there will be nothing that cannot be cured. </p>
<p>If there is bending at the waist and crying without tears, it is often related to abdominal pain, and one should use a formula with musk fragrance, or employ a warm stomach drink with added musk.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>If the spleen and kidneys are very cold, accompanied by pain, one should use Chen&#39;s Twelve Ingredients Formula. If there is excessive consumption of dairy causing stagnation and pain, where there is a real pathogen and no deficiency, one should use Baohe Pill or Harmonizing Stomach Decoction with adjustments; for severe cases, use Digestive Pill. If yin is excessive and yang is depleted, leading to insufficient heart qi and restlessness at night, one should use Sijunzi Decoction or Wuwei Different Function Powder, or Qifuding Decoction, or Mizhiyuan Anshen Pill. If the face is pale and hands are cold, indicating vacuity of yang qi and frightful spirit with crying, one should use Wujunxin Decoction or Liuwuwei Decoction; for severe cases, add roasted ginger and cinnamon to Qifuding Decoction. If there is diarrhea without breastfeeding due to weakness of spleen and kidneys, use Liushen Powder; for more severe conditions, use Yangzhong Decoction or Weiguan Decoction. If there is vomiting, diarrhea, and reduced appetite due to cold weakness of the spleen and stomach, use Wujunxin Decoction, Warming Stomach Decoction, or Liuwuwei Decoction with added roasted cardamom. If bowel movements are undigested, with reduced food intake and abdominal bloating due to weakness of spleen qi, use Wuwei Different Function Powder or Wujunxin Decoction with cardamom.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>If the complexion is white and the eyes are dark with little brightness, and the child cries at midnight during the Yin phase when Yang is weak, this indicates a deficiency of the liver and kidneys. It is advisable to use Liuwei Dihuang Wan, Bamei Wan, or Liyin Decoction. If the child becomes more agitated upon seeing lights or fire, this indicates heat in the heart. The heart belongs to fire; seeing fire can provoke internal heat, leading to a clash of Yang energies, resulting in the child crying while arching their body. Symptoms include a red face, warm hands and abdomen, and a feeling of heat in the mouth. For mild fire, it is appropriate to use Shengmai San or Daohong San; for strong fire, use Zhusha Anshen Wan or Renshen Huanglian San. If there is considerable heat in the liver and gallbladder, leading to a conflict of wood and fire, Chaihu Qinggan San should be used. Generally, this condition may arise from vomiting or diarrhea, leading to a loss of bodily fluids; or from a congenital deficiency of kidney yin unable to nourish the liver wood; or due to the wet nurse experiencing anger, where liver fire affects the metal. In this case, Liu Junzi Tang should be used to tonify the spleen earth to generate lung metal, and Dihuang Wan to strengthen kidney water to nourish liver wood. If the wet nurse feels depressed, Jiawei Guipi Decoction should be used; if she is extremely angry, Jiawei Xiao Chaihu Decoction; if there is a clash of heart and liver heat, Chaihu Qinggan San; and in cases of night crying due to shock, treat according to the previous discussion on shock-induced crying.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br><strong>Eastern Medicine Treasure</strong><br><em>(By Seo Jun, Korea)</em></p>
<p><strong>Convulsion Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Pediatric illnesses, including sudden and chronic convulsions, along with conditions like measles, are among the most severe, as their outcomes may quickly change life and death. A child experiencing convulsions three times is diagnosed with epilepsy, which is a serious condition. Among pediatric concerns, none is more dangerous than the convulsion syndrome. There are three types of convulsions: sudden convulsion, chronic convulsion, and slow spleen wind.</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Signs of Convulsion</strong></p>
<p>When an infant is about to experience a convulsion, signs include an unsettled mind, confusion, fear of others, wide-eyed gazing, looking around nervously, clenching fists, and showing unusual demeanor, all of which are early indicators of convulsion. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes may not exhibit twitching; if there is heat, the eyes may fixate without twitching; if heart heat is present, twitching may occur. This is because both the child and the mother might have excessive heat, causing conflict between wind and fire. Wang states that wood overcomes earth, and heat stirs the heart spirit, leading to convulsions. Qian states that liver wind and heart fire contend, resulting in twitching.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br><strong>Four Symptoms and Eight Signs</strong></p>
<p>The four symptoms are caused by wind, phlegm, and heat. The liver governs wind, the spleen governs phlegm, the lungs produce heat, and the heart experiences fright. When all four symptoms occur together, the most severe one manifests first. </p>
<p>The eight signs are as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First sign</strong>: Arm and elbow retract.</li>
<li><strong>Second sign</strong>: Fingers open and close; if this continues, it forms a fist. For men, when observing the thumb, if the thumb is outside, it is considered normal, while if it is inside, it is considered abnormal. Women observe it inversely.</li>
<li><strong>Third sign</strong>: Shoulder and hips retract, possibly resulting in the body jumping.</li>
<li><strong>Fourth sign</strong>: Various parts of the body, including hands, feet, head, or torso may tremble.</li>
<li><strong>Fifth sign</strong>: The head and body may bend backward.</li>
<li><strong>Sixth sign</strong>: The hand resembles a bow. For men, the left hand is straight and the right hand is bent, indicating normal; if the right is straight and the left is bent, it indicates abnormal. Women observe it inversely.</li>
<li><strong>Seventh sign</strong>: The eyes dart upward. For men, upward movement is considered normal, downward movement is abnormal. Women observe it inversely.</li>
<li><strong>Eighth sign</strong>: Men glance sideways; looking to the left is normal, looking to the right is abnormal. Women observe it inversely.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm Convulsions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In cases of phlegm convulsions, when the qi flows smoothly, the phlegm transforms and the convulsion stops on its own. Start with Su He Xiang Pill, followed by peppermint decoction mixed with ginger juice, or use Xing Xiang San.<br><strong>Five Symptoms of Fright Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Fright convulsion is one, and there are distinctions between morning and evening, as well as between exterior and interior conditions. Those with high body heat and strong force represent acute fright, while those with low body temperature and weak force indicate chronic fright. Those who fall silently and spit upon waking represent seizures, those who tilt their heads upward signify &quot;heavenly hanging,&quot; and those with arched backs represent tetanus; the treatment for each differs.<br><strong>Light and Heavy Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>If there are convulsions with arched backs and skewed vision, but the jaw isn&#39;t clenched and there&#39;s no phlegm or saliva, it is mostly due to external factors or internal injuries combined with fright, known as false convulsions, not arising from internal fright seizures. It is advisable to use Shen Su Decoction or Ren Shen Qiang Huo San. Convulsions involving hands and feet pulling, alternating between stretching and contracting, are referred to as severe tetanus. Yan Xiao Zhong stated: &quot;It resembles a convulsion but isn’t severe; this is named tetanus.&quot; Initially, acute fright causes both convulsions and contractions, but over time, convulsions may stop while contractions persist—some urgent, some slow. If only the shoulders move in tetanus, it indicates a lighter case; if there are strong convulsions, it is severe, and contractions indicate greater severity.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Fright</strong></p>
<p>Sudden fright occurs when one is unexpectedly startled; it causes the heart to be shocked and the liver to control wind, leading to muscle and tendon spasms. The liver also governs the sinews, so it is appropriate to use formulas like Tongxin Drink, Xieqing Pill, Liangjing Pill, and Daqing Ointment. Sudden fright arises from hearing unusual sounds or encountering the roar of beasts, resulting in a tight jaw, fierce heat, excessive saliva, wild eye movements, spasms and shaking, heat in the mouth, flushed cheeks and lips, and yellow or red urine, with a pulse that is floating, rapid, forceful, and tense. This condition is due to internal excessive heat, combined with external wind evil, leading to heat accumulation in the heart and shock, while wind arising from the liver causes spasms. The conflict between liver wind and heart fire creates chaos in the blood and qi, leading to phlegm and saliva obstruction. Hence, all the channels are blocked, and the wind-qi thrives without release, resulting in explosive symptoms. </p>
<p>Treatment: Open the channels to disperse the wind and settle the spasms to eliminate phlegm. If there is still heat present, it must be cleared; after relieving it, it is essential to harmonize the stomach and calm the heart, stopping the wind and settling the spasms.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br>First, administer dispersing and calming herbs for fright, followed by the Wind-Driving Ointment, Heart-Calming Pills, Liver-Calming Pills, Qian’s Spirit-Calming Pills, Tranquilizing Pills, Infant Protective Herbal Pills, and Ling Shen Ointment. If phlegm is abundant, one should use Long Wan and Jie Feng Wan. For calming the heart and spirit, it’s appropriate to use Gold Leaf Heart-Calming Pills and Peaceful Heart Ointment.</p>
<p>The so-called Warm Fright Pills, Beneficial Fright Pills, and Cooling Fright Pills indicate that if the condition is deficiency, then use warming; if it is fullness, then use benefiting; if it is heat, then use cooling. This is known as the method of adaptation.</p>
<p>When the symptoms of fright wind are unclear, if it is said to be a Yin condition, the whole body feels warm; if it is a Yang condition, there might be little twitching. This results from not distinguishing between Yin and Yang. It is advisable to use Fang Feng Wen Dan Decoction, along with the Great Fright Pill and Small Fright Pill.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden fright, one should first stabilize the twitching. Twitching comes from wind, and wind arises from heat. Once twitching has started, then heat can be reduced to calm the fright. If the heat does not dissipate, the fright will not disperse either.</p>
<p>For sudden fright, it is crucial to stop the wind and stabilize twitching. Once the wind and twitching are stabilized, one can then reduce heat, and if the heat leaves, the wind will be gone, allowing the twitching to cease.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>Slow shock occurs after a major illness, following vomiting and diarrhea, or after taking cold and cooling medicines. The symptoms include a slow and sluggish appearance, eyes that are slow to open, trembling in the hands and feet, a pale blue complexion, coldness throughout the body and limbs, silence, and a pulse that is deep and slow. Use Baizhu powder and Yihuang powder, adding Fangfeng and Dongguaren for decoction.</p>
<p>Slow shock is a Yin disorder, whereas acute shock is a Yang disorder. If it follows immediately after vomiting and diarrhea, it is classified as slow shock. For men, the emphasis is on diarrhea; for women, on vomiting. </p>
<p>For pure Yin cases of slow shock, Wu Xie powder is appropriate; if Yang manifestations are still present, use Chan Xie powder. </p>
<p>In cases of lingering Yang manifestations, there is no need to restore Yang but instead alleviate wind and adjust the stomach using Chan Xie powder and Xingpi powder. If the hands and feet are cold, then it is permissible to restore Yang with sulfur and Aconite. Substances such as brain, musk, silver powder, and other similar items are strictly prohibited.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br>It is said in ancient texts: the family of the sick fears being startled but not diarrhea, while the physician fears diarrhea but not being startled. If diarrhea does not stop, one should first treat the diarrhea; if one treats the wind instead, the shock from the wind may worsen.</p>
<p>Diarrhea that is greenish must be treated cautiously for the slow shock, as greenish diarrhea is associated with being startled, where wood overcomes earth. When a child experiences greenish diarrhea, it is due to the spleen being overpowered by the liver, which results in a manifestation of its fundamental essence as a consequence of internal coldness. Thus, the herb astragalus is used to supplement and guide.</p>
<p>For children experiencing slow shock, if there is continuous vomiting and diarrhea transforming into internal wind convulsions, it is not merely wind, but rather a result of the stomach&#39;s energy being nearly exhausted. Use five whole pills of Restore the Essence Dan, crush them into powder, and drink them; the effect will be immediate.</p>
<p>For slow shock, it is advisable to use warming shock pills, miraculous powders, Guanyin powders, whole scorpion Guanyin powders, three-flavor syrup powders, spleen-tonifying decoctions, Baosheng Dan, Yansheng Dan, ginseng and pinellia decoction, Fangfeng pills, and Yinhong powders. When there is abundant saliva, one should use Life-Threatening powders, Double Gold pills, or Nanjing decoction.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Wind from Slow Shock Not Being Treated:</p>
<p>The child may convulse mildly and is sluggish in spirit; the limbs and breath are cold, the eyes remain slightly open during sleep, and there may be stomach pain accompanied by cries resembling crows. This condition is already critical due to weakness in the spleen and stomach. When slow shock appears to be overwhelming, internal phlegm rises and obstructs the throat, causing coarse breathing and a rapid, floating pulse, indicating that yin has become too strong over yang. </p>
<p>One may mistakenly believe that the yang energy has returned and then administer harsh medicines to expel phlegm; as the phlegm descends with the medicine, the medicine along with the phlegm may be eliminated. This leads to blame toward the doctor, as they do not recognize the dangerous signs, and even without administering medicine, there will be no chance of recovery.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a></p>
<h3>Urgent and Slow Wind Treatments</h3>
<p><strong>For Acute and Chronic Wind Issues:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the following remedies: Jiumai Pill, Niu Huang Bao Long Pill, Bao Ming Pill, Zhi Sheng Bao Ming Pill, Qian Jin Powder, Xing Xiang Powder, Zhu Fen Powder, Duo Ming Powder, Tan Sheng Powder.</p>
<p><strong>For Slow Spleen Wind:</strong></p>
<p>If the eyes are half-closed, it indicates spleen wind. Observing slow reactions is crucial; if the eyes are dim, that is serious; if vision is obstructed, that is serious; if the limbs are cold, that is serious; if the eyes do not blink, that is serious; blinking without looking around is also serious; if sweat flows like oil, that is serious; if the face suddenly turns dark, that is severe. When the eyes are half-open and half-closed, it signifies a predominance of Yin energy that has penetrated the organs, leading to a deficiency in Yang energy. The spleen meridian is Yin, which thus affects the spleen, hence the term &quot;slow spleen wind.&quot; </p>
<p>For those with half-open and half-closed eyes, one should prepare for treatment of slow spleen wind. Medications for slow spleen wind should be used only when necessary, as the situation is critical, like a lamp running out of oil, gradually dimming. Qian family recommends mixing Jin Ye Dan and Qingzhou Bai Wanzi in equal parts. Administer with a decoction of mint tea, one qian (3 grams), as this reverses wind and restores Yang. </p>
<p>For children, even with a hot head, if the eyes are pale and the feet are cold; even with a hot head, if there is abdominal distension and cold feet; even with a hot head, if there is diarrhea and cold feet; even with a hot head, if there is vomiting and cold feet; even with a hot head, if there is thirst and cold feet. These five symptoms, when accompanied by spasms, are termed slow spleen wind. Quickly administer Bu Pi Yi Zhen Tang with one whole scorpion added, or use Quan Xia Guanyin Powder.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br><strong>Chronic Spleen Wind Untreated Condition</strong></p>
<p>The body is cold with sticky sweat, lying motionless like a corpse, wheezing with a soft head, a straight back, and closed mouth; head shaking, inability to control bowel movements, lips retracting, and breathing coarse, with phlegm sounding like a saw—this condition is untreatable. If chronic spleen wind is seen with a vital organ failing, medication should not be used. Signs like lack of light in the eyes, black nails, drooping limbs, a cold body, do not require medication.</p>
<p><strong>Heavenly Suspended Sudden Shock</strong></p>
<p>Master Sun said: When traveling far on horseback, one should bathe and change clothes before approaching a baby; otherwise, one may often suffer from sudden illnesses. Qian Zhongyang said: Avoid the foul air of walking in filth near a baby, as it may provoke sudden shock. Heavenly suspension is also a manifestation of sudden shock, but during its onset, the head is tilted back, and there is no sudden shock. This occurs due to the nurse’s excess heat from overfeeding, generating heat in the heart and lungs, compounded by outside wind pathogens; it is advisable to use Nine Dragon Saliva Controlling Powder or Diaoteng Powder. If heat is intense, then the Life-Saving Pill, if phlegm is abundant, use the Baolong Pill. If there’s stooping and tension, swollen external kidneys, urine like rice wash, and red veins or blood spots in the eyes, it indicates blockage by cold; Diaoteng Syrup is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Tremors and Spasms</strong></p>
<p>Tremors and spasms are also types of sudden shock. Tremors are characterized by icy hands and feet, while spasms manifest as rigid body posture. Tremors and spasms are essentially the same condition, differentiated by yang (active) and yin (passive) qualities. The active type has sweat, while the passive type does not. Symptoms include rigid limbs, backward arching of the waist, which are more severe than wind convulsions, and generally not treatable.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>When a person has three sudden seizures due to fright, it is called epilepsy, commonly a serious illness in children. Adults refer to it as &quot;dian&quot; and children as &quot;xian,&quot; though they are essentially the same condition. It is also noted that those over ten years old have &quot;dian&quot; while those under ten have &quot;xian.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sudden epilepsy&quot; manifests as acute fright. During an episode, the person may fall to the ground and make sounds, and upon waking, may drool. In cases of mild or intense fright, they typically do not make sounds or drool. </p>
<p>In an epileptic episode, the person suddenly faints, eyes wide and drooling, showing signs of agitation, limbs convulsing, remaining silent and in a stupor, resembling a state between life and death, sometimes making a harsh cry, but eventually regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>The Qian family&#39;s treatment includes five varieties of epilepsy affecting the five internal organs, using five-colored pills. </p>
<p>The treatment should differentiate between the two main conditions of fright-induced and wind-induced seizures. For fright-related epilepsy, typically arising from accumulated fear, leading to crying and confusion, it is advised to use the Spirit-Settling Pill or the Cenxiang Tianma Decoction. For wind-related seizures, when external pathogens invade and the patient first curls their fingers as if counting before the episode, the Chase-Wind and Eliminate Phlegm Pill is recommended. </p>
<p>For pain related to food, involving interruptions due to fright during dairy consumption causing accumulation, or when there are signs of complications such as foul-smelling stool, the Zisha Pill is advised. </p>
<p>Initially, if there is a hot body, convulsions and crying, it is categorized as yang-type epilepsy, which is easier to treat, suggesting use of the Longnao Anshen Pill or the Clear Heart and Phlegm-Rolling Pill. </p>
<p>Initially, if there is no heat in the body, hands and feet are cool, with no convulsions or crying, it is categorized as yin-type epilepsy, which is more difficult to treat; the five-colored pill should be used to guide the spirit back home. </p>
<p>Due to sudden fright leading to epilepsy, the Five Epilepsy Pill is recommended.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>Due to a fright, one develops seizures. Take the elixir and dissolve one or two pills of mint in soup; recovery follows immediately. There are also cases where a fetus is frightened, leading to seizures, which should be treated with burnt pills.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Sudden rigidity leads to epilepsy. It also says: If evil energy attacks the Yang, it results in epilepsy. The ailment of vertigo arises from insufficient heart qi, with heat accumulating in the chest, and phlegm-heat interacting to stir up wind. The disorder between wind and heart causes confusion and dizziness, hence it is called vertigo. </p>
<p>When phlegm is stagnant in the diaphragm, dizziness is mild and does not lead to fainting. But if phlegm overflows from the diaphragm, dizziness worsens, causing one to fall to the ground and lose awareness, termed epilepsy. Adults refer to it as epilepsy, while children call it seizures, but they are essentially the same. It is said that fainting without awareness is due to evil qi ascending, disrupting the head. </p>
<p>In cases of epilepsy, phlegm and evil qi ascend, causing disorder in the head. A chaotic qi leads to blocked pathways, preventing the openings from functioning properly, resulting in inability to hear sounds or recognize people, leading to confusion and collapse. Since the illness manifests at the crown of the head, it is termed vertex disease.</p>
<p>There are five types of seizures: the liver is associated with the chicken, the heart with the horse, the spleen with the cow, the lungs with the sheep, and the kidneys with the pig, based on the similarity of symptoms. In essence, it is a combination of phlegm, fire, and fright. </p>
<p>Generally, this condition is often caused by phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest; hence, it is necessary to resolve phlegm and calm the spirit. If the spirit is unguarded, leading to nonsensical speech and behavior, persisting for years without recovery, and if the heart gives rise to heat, it is essential to clear the heart and eliminate heat. If phlegm obscures the heart&#39;s orifices, one must remove the phlegm and calm the heart, resorting to significant purging and clearing for recovery.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>In cases of epilepsy, during a seizure, the person makes sounds and drools when they awaken, only to have the seizure return intermittently without rest. In contrast, for conditions like stroke, cold, heat, or corpse-like state, the person is silent during the seizure, does not drool when they awaken, and does not have recurrent episodes. </p>
<p>Epilepsy is characterized by abnormalities; those afflicted may speak normally on ordinary days; whereas with seizures, there is often a lack of speech. During a seizure, the person may groan, and in severe cases, they might stiffen and stare blankly, experiencing a persistent feeling of unhappiness, speaking incoherently, behaving as if drunk or dazed. </p>
<p>Seizures involve sudden loss of consciousness, teeth clenching, making sounds, drooling, and a complete loss of awareness, followed by awakening. For those experiencing petit mal seizures, it is advisable to use pill formulations for treatment. If the pulse is strong and hot (yang), use the Miaoxiang pills; if cool and deep (yin), use the Wusheng pills. For those who are overweight with phlegm, it is best to use the Chasing Wind and Expelling Phlegm pills, the Jiawei Shouxing pills, or the Yinshi Guizhe Dan. For slender individuals with excess heat, use the Qingxin Gun Fan pills or the Longnao Anshen pills. </p>
<p>If phlegm obstructs the heart orifices, employ the Jinfan Zhenxin pills or the Kongyan pills. If both phlegm and fire are strong, use the Gansui San to induce vomiting and purging. If the seizures are due to fright, use the Jingqi pills or the Baolong pills. If caused by anger, use the Ningshen Daotan decoction or the Danggui Longhui pills. For a weak heart with insufficient qi and blood, employ the Ziyin Ningshen decoction, the Qingxin Wendan decoction, or the Guishen Dan. </p>
<p>Women may benefit from Jiawei Xiaoyao San or Zhushagao. For the five types of epilepsy, use the Longnao Anshen pills, Wuxian pills, Liuzhen Dan, Qian&#39;s Five-Color pills, Yuhun Dan, Choubao pills, Chitou pills, Huohu Dan, Bianfu San, or the Fan Dan pills. If seizures recur after recovery, it is recommended to use the Duanxian Dan.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Medical Section, Volume 429</strong></p>

<p>This is for treating infants who have just been born, with excessive blood and qi, experiencing alternating chills and fevers, sudden spasms in their limbs, high fever, and severe vomiting. If the infant is able to breastfeed but is unable to digest, suffering from excessive heat that transforms into steaming and can&#39;t be relieved, along with symptoms of ghostly influences and all types of epilepsy, this formula is fully applicable. All children under ten years old can take this. The Longdan Decoction for infants is the primary formula for newborns. For those who grow according to the sun and moon cycles, follow accordingly as an example. If it is necessary to know about ghostly influences and qi, you can add ginseng and angelica, adjusting the amount of Longdan accordingly: for a baby one hundred days old, add three golds; for two hundred days, six golds; for one year old, half a tael; the rest of the herbs are measured in the same way. </p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Longdan, Diao Teng Pi (Vine bark), Chai Hu (Bupleurum), Huang Qin (Scutellaria), Jie Geng (Platycodon), Shao Yao (Peony), Fu Ling (Poria), Gan Cao (Licorice), each six golds; two scarabs; one tael of Da Huang (Rhubarb). </p>
<p>Preparation: Chop the ten ingredients and boil them with one liter of water, reducing it to five cups as the dosage. The method of administration is as follows: for infants born to seven days old, divide one cup into three doses; for those born between eight and fifteen days, divide one and a half cups into three doses; for those born between sixteen and twenty days, divide two cups into three doses; for those born between twenty and thirty days, divide three cups into three doses; for those born between thirty and forty days, use all five cups divided into three doses. Administer until results are seen and do not continue further.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br><strong>Da Huang Decoction:</strong> Treats childhood wind seizures, abdominal pain from accumulation, and upward reversal in twenty-five seizures.

<p>For treating urgent and chronic convulsions in children, phlegm and saliva obstructing the throat, where life is at stake, this drug descends the phlegm and is a sacred remedy for convulsions due to phlegm.<br>1 tael of genuine limestone, 0.5 taels of nitre.  </p>
<p>Grind them together into a powder. Take half a qian or one qian per dose. For acute phlegm heat related to convulsions, use mint and schizonepeta soup, mixed with raw honey to take. For chronic convulsions due to spleen deficiency, use cardamom soup mixed with cooked honey to take. Although limestone and nitre effectively resolve phlegm, they are not suitable if caused by weak spleen and stomach.  </p>
<p>Wang Keng-Tang says: This medicine has great power to control phlegm and saliva. Regardless of acute or chronic convulsions, with phlegm swelling and blocking the throat, creating a sound like tides, termed &quot;tide saliva,&quot; where no medicine can pass, and life is at stake, first use this medicine to enter the throat, and phlegm will immediately descend, functioning perfectly, seizing the essence of nature.  </p>
<p>He also states: For acute convulsions with phlegm obstructing upwards, and a body temperature like fire, use fresh mint juice mixed with honey to take warm. After a long while, the medicine will wrap the phlegm which will then descend and be expelled like thick mucus, this is the effect of the medicine; then take other heat-dispelling and convulsion-stopping drugs.  </p>

<p>Xieqing Pill treats excess heat in the liver channel and urgent convulsions. Qianghuo and Yinbi both treat the same. Dahuang purges excess heat, Chuanxiong enters the hand and foot jueyin to alleviate liver tension. Gardenia fruit clears heart fire and purges its effects. Gentian is fried to nourish liver and gallbladder energy to stop convulsions. Angelica enters the foot jueyin to nourish the blood. Fangfeng is equally distributed.</p>
<p>Grind it into powder, and make honey pills the size of gorgon nuts. Each dose is half a pill, infused in bamboo leaf soup sweetened with sugar. One variation adds licorice and peony. Another does not include angelica. Xue Ji states: The previous formula for the foot jueyin liver channel disperses muscle pathogens and clears internal heat using bitter-cold medicine. If there is constipation, thirst for cold drinks, and normal appetite, it suggests a tangible illness; this should be treated with laxatives. If the bowel movements are regular, thirst for cold drinks, and the eyes are a light blue color, this indicates a tangible illness with weak vitality; in such a case, use Yiping pills to stabilize.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>If the stools are not solid, one should drink soup for thirst, eat less, and feel fatigue in the limbs, indicating a condition of deficiency. It is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to supplement. If there is wind generated by blood deficiency in the liver channel, first use Si Wu Tang with added Dao Teng Gou to nourish the liver blood, and then use Si Jun Zi Tang to tonify the spleen. If phlegm arises from dryness of the liver blood, use Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water and benefit liver blood. If the earth cannot nourish the wood, use Si Jun Zi Tang with added Dang Gui to supplement the center, and Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys. If the lung metal restrains the liver wood, use Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Shao Yao and Mu Xiang to solidify the spleen earth and balance the lung metal. If the heart is deficient and deprives the mother’s qi, or if kidney water is deficient and cannot generate the liver wood, Di Huang Wan should be used to address it. If one frequently takes harsh medicines resulting in deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, one must use Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Ding Xiang and Mu Xiang to tonify the spleen and stomach to support yang qi. If a nursing mother experiences anger and causes liver fire to act recklessly, affecting the child, add flavor to Xiao Chai Hu Tang for the child. If the nursing mother has liver and spleen blood deficiency with fever, affecting the child, she should take an enhanced Xiao Yao San, and the child should also take a few drops. The formula “De Xiao Fang” states: It is also called Liang Gan Wan. The liver governs wind, so one should first cool the liver to dispel wind.</p>

<p>Xueji states: according to previous symptoms, if there is crying, fever, thirst to drink water, and strong convulsions while sleeping on the back, these fall under excess heat in the heart and should use Xiexin Decoction or Daohong San. If there is fever and drinking soup, weak convulsions, palpitations, and sleeping with face down, these indicate deficiency-heat in the heart, and should use Buxin San. If there is coughing with a red face, high fever, and drinking water, indicating lung controlling heart, use Xiebai San. If there is head shaking, eyes rolling, body heat, and convulsions indicating liver controlling heart, use Chaihu Qinggan San. If there is closed eyes and deep sleep, diarrhea, and body heat indicating spleen controlling heart, use Xiehuang San. If there are running eyes, palpitations, and teeth grinding indicating kidney controlling heart, use Anshen Wan. If caused by the wet nurse, the previous medicines should be used to treat the mother.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>Daohong San treats excess heat in the small intestine, with symptoms of dark, scanty urination.

<p>Prepare this as a powder; take one qian (about 3 grams) with cool bamboo leaves and water to decoct. One variation adds Huangqin, Chishao, Qianghuo, and Dengxin for decoction. Another variation omits Licorice and uses Huangqin instead. </p>
<p>Xue Ji stated that according to the Xiaxin Decoction and Daohong San, these are prescriptions for clearing heart and small intestine excess fire. The heart is the mother of the spleen, and the spleen is the child of the heart. However, if the heart is ill, the spleen is likely to be weak, so practitioners should be cautious. It is advisable to protect the spleen&#39;s earth.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br><strong>Shengxi San</strong> treats the heart&#39;s empty heat.<br><strong>Digu Pi</strong>, <strong>Chi Shao</strong>, <strong>Chai Hu</strong>, and <strong>Gan Ge</strong>, each one and two taels; <strong>Gan Cao</strong>, five qian. Grind these into a powder. Take one to two qian each time, decocted in water. <strong>Xi Jiao</strong>, two qian, is for wind-heat seizure, calming the liver and clearing heart heat. Danxi said: Xi Jiao is used post-pox to disperse residual toxins. However, if there is no toxin but the blood is empty, or if it has mistakenly been used when there is already dryness and heat, calamities will follow. Xue Ji said: The previous prescription states it treats the heart&#39;s empty heat, yet many of the medicines used mainly belong to the categories of draining the heart and liver. The term &quot;empty heat&quot; may likely be a transcription error. If the heart&#39;s disease originates from blood deficiency heat, use <strong>Mi Zhi An Shen Wan</strong>. If the spleen is deficient, seizing the heart&#39;s energy and causing heat, use <strong>Mi Zhi Bu Pi Tang</strong>. If the liver fails to nourish the heart fire, leading to empty heat, use <strong>Di Huang Wan</strong>.</p>

<p>These are slightly stir-fried with honey wine and ground into a powder. The dosage is 1 to 2 qian, decocted in water. Xue Ji stated: If symptoms include thirst for cold drinks, lying down with eyes closed, hot hands and feet, or jaundice, this indicates excess heat in the stomach channel, and Xie Huang San should be used. If there is thirst for soup, lying down with exposed eyes, and cold hands and feet, this indicates deficiency heat in the stomach channel, and Yi Gong San should be used. If the face is green, with a writhing belly and little appetite for dairy, this indicates liver overacting on the spleen; use Mi Zhi Bu Pi Tang. If the face is red with anxiety, body heat, and somnolence, this indicates heart overacting on the spleen; use Mi Zhi An Shen Wan. If there is a pale face with wheezing and fatigue, indicating lung overacting on the spleen, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If there are black lips and diarrhea with cold fingers and toes, indicating kidney overacting on the spleen, use Yi Huang San. After illness, if fluids are insufficient, leading to dry mouth and thirst, use Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. If a nursing mother consumes rich and heavy foods, leading to emotional excess fire, the cause must be identified and treated in the mother.</p>
<p>Gua Lou Tang treats chronic fright.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 qian of melon dung root</li>
<li>1 qian of white sweetwormwood</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be lightly roasted over a slow fire until yellow and then ground into a powder. Each dose is 2-3 fen, taken with a decoction of mint and musk. Xue Ji explains: According to Xu Yongcheng, Qian’s treatment for gradual fright uses melon soup, fearing that there may be transcription errors. This is because fright is primarily due to the wind element, associated with the Yang of wood; acute conditions are easy to treat, while chronic conditions are difficult. Moreover, children’s internal organs are not fully developed, and when they experience gradual fright, it is not a result of post-illness or vomit and diarrhea leading to spleen and stomach deficiency. Thus, be cautious with such harsh remedies.</p>
<p>Wang Keng Tang adds: The melon soup on the right is a method by Qian for treating gradual fright, suitable for those with a strong pulse. This condition is caused by damp phlegm accumulating in the diaphragm, preventing wind and fire from resolving, leading to a cold body; hence the use of melon soup to eliminate damp phlegm allows wind and fire to manifest, warming and halting spasms. If the pulse is weak, it is inappropriate to use this; instead, one should supplement the spleen and apply warming formulas like Warming Fright Pill or similar remedies.</p>
<p><strong>Warming Fright Pill</strong>: Treats symptoms of gradual fright. Also known as Pink Powder Pill.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 liang of dried southern star (Nux vomica) powder, mixed with ox bile and air-dried for 100 days.</li>

<li>1 liang of safflower</li>
<li>0.5 qian of raw lip pigment</li>
<li>5 fen of dragon brain (benzoin), ground separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mixture should be made into pills the size of a chicken head; each dose is one pill, or half a pill for smaller children, taken with sugar water. Xue Ji states: Gradual fright is attributed to deficiency of the spleen and stomach Yang, with cold from the liver, hence Warming Fright Pill is used to warm it. However, the herbs included are primarily spicy and disperse Yang Qi to eliminate phlegm, and the practitioner should assess accordingly.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br>Ren Shen Li Zhong Wan treats the deficiency heat of the middle Jiao.<br>Ingredients: Ginseng, fried Atractylodes, roasted Licorice, all in equal parts.<br>Grind to a powder, form into pills the size of a soybean using ginger juice, take 20 to 30 pills each time, with warm water.

If there are fright and restlessness during sleep, the Secret Formula Anshen Pills should be used. If the mother’s temper is excessive and causes the child to suffer, the Modified Xiaoyao Powder should be used.

<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>4 taels of White Atractylodes (Bai Zhu)</li>
<li>2 taels of roasted Licorice (Gan Cao)</li>
<li>1.5 taels of processed Aconite (Fu Zi), peeled and with the seed removed</li>
</ul>
<p>Method: Grind the above into a fine powder, then add Aconite. For each dose, take 3 qian, along with 5 slices of ginger and 1 jujube, and decoct in water for consumption.</p>
<p>Xue Ji states: &quot;In my humble opinion, Aconite warms the center and restores yang; it is the premier medicine for the spleen&#39;s slow function. If the vital energy is not depleted, its efficacy is guaranteed. Use pieces weighing around 1.5 to 2.4 qian, regular and flat with a shape resembling a lotus flower; otherwise, they resemble poisonous black Aconite.&quot;</p>
<p>Preparation method: Cut off the pointed ends and soak in child&#39;s urine for a specified period—7 days in autumn and winter, and 5 days in spring and summer, changing the urine daily. After soaking, cut into four pieces, wrap them in several layers of damp paper, and gently simmer for half a day. After removal, cut open; if there are no white specks, it is prepared correctly. If needed urgently, process until cracks form, then immediately soak in child’s urine for an extended period, slice once fully soaked, and if the color is white, lightly roast again. For severe depletion of energy, urgent use is effective as well.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br>Taiyi Baosheng Pill is used to treat lingering fright with residual Yang symptoms. </p>

<p>Xue Ji states: According to the previous prescription, it treats the wind-heat in the heart and liver meridians. If the heart and liver are deficient, leading to panic and tidal fever, use the An Shen Wan instead. If the liver&#39;s wood overacts on the spleen, add Chai Hu (Bupleurum) and Diao Teng.

<p>For panicked conditions, it is a symptom of dry fluids.

Xue Ji says: If the condition is already one of interior excess with constipation, the method should focus on purging. If after the initial dose there is no bowel movement but the illness has lessened, do not take more. If there is still no bowel movement and the illness is not alleviated, reduce the number of pills and consume them in a dissolved form, as excessive dosing may harm the vital energy and worsen the condition.</p>

When liver qi is hot, it produces wind; when wind and heat collide, it causes convulsions and inevitably damages liver blood. However, if there is excess, it should be regarded as insufficient. If one frequently uses remedies to dispel wind and calm fright, it may compromise the spleen and stomach, leading to chronic fright. Caution is advised!</p>

<p>Grind these into a powder and form into pills the size of a mung bean using aged rice porridge. Take 2 to 3 pills with peppermint tea. Xue Ji comments: This formulation treats epilepsy, convulsions, and reduces phlegm accumulation. The use of Qian Niu and caster bean is intended to break the firm masses of phlegm and fluids. As the ancient Zhang states, it is like a general who seizes the strategic points in battle; it should be used only when symptoms are substantial, as it indeed has the power to restore life.

<p>These are to be made into a powder, refined with honey into pills the size of a broad bean. Each dose is one or two pills taken with mint decoction or Mai Dong (ophiopogon) decoction. Note that this formula is hot in nature, with strong heat, and should not be given during acute fright. </p>
<p>Xue Ji says: According to the ingredients in this formula, they are quite miscellaneous.

<p>Danxi stated: The Baolong Pills are for the heart, lungs, and liver. &quot;Bao&quot; means to protect; &quot;Long&quot; refers to the liver. The liver is the mother, and the heart is the child; if the mother is at peace, the child is at peace. Moreover, the heart houses the spirit, and the liver houses the soul. Once the spirit and soul are settled, where can fright arise?</p>
<p>Xue Ji noted: The main functions of this pill are to resolve phlegm, expel evil, and clear heat, especially effective for conditions arising from excess heat in the liver and heart. However, if the spleen and lungs are weak, leading to drowsiness and phlegmy cough, then the Baojian Tianma Powder should be used to replenish the vital energy.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>The Wan family said: Strong and healthy children should use it. However, within it contains medicinal substances like male red gold stone that cannot be consumed. For instance, musk consumes true vitality and can draw in the wind evil, much like oil cannot be expelled once it enters the skin. Therefore, everyone forbids it and does not use it lightly. Wang Kengtang said: For the medicine mentioned, for infants of a hundred days, each pill is divided into three or four doses; for five-year-olds, one or two pills; for adults, three to five pills. It also treats white discharge in young girls; for summer heat, chew a small amount of salt with one or two pills and swallow with freshly drawn water. Boiling snow water in the twelfth month, combined with licorice and the medicine, is especially good. One method involves soaking southern star root in rice water or fresh water for three days until it is translucent, then boiling it softly for three to five times, taking it out, cutting off the skin while soft, only taking the white soft part, thinly slicing it, drying it out, and roasting it until yellow. Take eight taels of this powder, with two and a half taels of licorice smashed, use two bowls of water to soak overnight, then slowly boil until half a bowl remains, remove the dregs, and gradually pour the southern star powder into it while slowly grinding, ensuring the licorice water is fully absorbed before adding the remaining medicine.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>Heavenly Energy Powder treats urgent fright with weakness of the spleen and stomach, or transforming into chronic fright. </p>

If using a recipe that includes three scarabs (with heads and feet removed and fried until yellow), add 1 qian of Aconite for cold deficiency.

For those over five years old, use it with Gan Lu San. Xue Ji noted: &quot;It seems that Da Qing Gao is a remedy for superficial dispersal; it should only be applied when external evils have settled in the lungs, and lung energy has not been damaged. Furthermore, the previous symptoms indicate a deficiency in spleen and lung qi, with the evil taking advantage of this.

Another formula uses the previous medicines, wrapped in dough on a cold food day, taken out after seven days, to be consumed with ginger tea. Xue Ji noted: &quot;The previous symptoms are attributed to a deficiency of spleen qi, cold with lack of yang. If there&#39;s no wind to disperse, nor phlegm to expel, it is necessary to also use Liu Jun Zi Tang and Twelve Flavor Yi Gong San, along with Mu Xiang San.&quot;<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>Niu Huang Wan treats excessive heat and dissipates accumulations. </p>

<p>Xue Ji states: This formula is a powerful remedy that can save a life. One must thoroughly assess the condition before administering it, as there is a risk involved. The classic states: where evil gathers, its energy must be weak; if it lingers, the illness becomes real. The real illness is the pathogenic energy being strong while the body&#39;s energy is weak. </p>
<p>Mr. Dong Yuan states that when the body&#39;s condition is fully real, a purging treatment is necessary, not a tonifying one; when the body&#39;s condition is completely weak, tonifying is appropriate, not purging. The practitioner must carefully assess!</p>

Adding white peony root is especially beneficial. These three ingredients are all sweet and warm, capable of replenishing vital energy. Sweetness can clear heat. The Inner Canon states: when heat is excessive within, it should be mitigated with sweetness and contained with sourness. White peony root is sour and cool, which can also clear heat; its sour flavor can drain the liver while greatly nourishing the lungs, thereby enhancing both metal and earth energies. When fire is deficient, how can wind and wood overcome the earth? Thus, expel the邪 of wind. Formulas like Yao Huang San, Li Zhong Wan, and Yang Shen Wan are all excellent remedies for conditions of excessive cold dampness in the spleen and stomach. If heat dynamic is trapped within the spleen and stomach due to insufficient effort and one takes hot medicines like ba dou, it can lead to a weak stomach and chronic shock syndrome, which can be harmful. Chronic shock is always due to a prolonged weakening of the spleen and stomach. Qian&#39;s method using Qiang Huo ointment to treat chronic shock has proven effective. For those with spleen deficiency, fire pathogens take advantage of their earth&#39;s position, which is why this condition is called “virtual邪.” When fire is strong, it can bolster wood, and when wood is abundant, it can attack the earth. Therefore, in heart conditions, one should sweetly and warmly nourish the source of earth, while in the spleen, drain heat with cool sweetness and fortify metal with sour cold, leading to a strong metal and weak fire in the spleen, thus alleviating the wind and wood. Reducing food intake and increasing medicinal consumption will lead to self-recovery; the aforementioned medicines can aid in this.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br><strong>Yi Huang San</strong>: Treats stomach wind-heat.<br>Ingredients: 2 qian of Astragalus, 1 qian each of dried tangerine peel and ginseng, 7 fen of peony root, 5 fen each of raw and cooked licorice, a pinch of Coptis.

<p>Ingredients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genuine amber: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Turmeric: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Finely powdered sandalwood: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Ginseng (peeled): 1.5 taels</li>
<li>White poria (peeled): 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Fresh licorice: 3 taels (cut to remove joints)</li>
<li>Bitter orange peel (roasted): 1 tael</li>
<li>Bitter orange (soaked in water, roasted until slightly yellow): 1 tael</li>
<li>Chinese yam (peeled, cut into small pieces, stir-fried over low heat until thoroughly heated): 1 pound</li>
<li>Noxious star (shredded): 1 tael (fermented with sulfur and cow bile over the summer)</li>
<li>Cinnabar: 5 taels (first use a magnet to remove iron filings, then grind in a mortar to remove floating impurities; clarify in a clean container and drain excess water, following this process to refine it until pure, then dry for use)</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the final powdered medicine (1 tael) with 100 sheets of gold leaf, grind together very finely in a mortar, blend with the previous mixture, then form into pills the size of green peas using fresh well water, and air-dry. Each dose should be taken with mint decoction.</p>
<p>Amber Dragon Ball contains nourishing ingredients that everyone appreciates. However, the two ingredients, bitter orange peel and bitter orange, can disperse stagnant energy. For those without stagnant energy, they may weaken the vital energy in the chest. In cases of chronic fright or weakened vital energy, these two ingredients should be reduced; they can be replaced with 2 taels each of angelica and chuanxiong. Ensure that the amber and turmeric are genuine.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br>Wang Kengtang said: The first twelve ingredients, excluding vermilion and gold leaf which are not ground together, and among the remaining ten, sandalwood is the only one not subjected to heat. Nine of the ingredients are either sun-dried or roasted, ground into a powder, and mixed evenly. Use one tael of vermilion and one tael of gold leaf. Take one tael of fresh well water, slightly pound it in a mortar, and roll it into balls the size of a chicken egg, then dry in the shade. In sunny weather, avoid excessive exposure to sunlight as it may cause cracking. It is advisable to leave them in a windy place to dry naturally. The preparation method also uses scallion broth, to be taken at any time, or mint broth. If phlegm causes severe coughing, take it with light ginger broth. If smallpox appears unexpectedly, take it with warm clean broth. For palpitations and unease, take it with lamp grass broth. In hot weather, if there is fatigue or confusion, take it with water from cooked Ophiopogon. For infants within a hundred days, take three doses of each pill. For those over two years old, limit to one or two pills.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a><br>When preparing the medicinal formula, if one ingredient is missing and it does not follow the established standards, it will surely be ineffective. Always use a ceramic bottle to combine with musk, to prevent the scent from dissipating. Mix in one tael of pearl powder, called &quot;Golden Pearl Powder.&quot; Pearls can calm the heart and soothe the liver, particularly effective for expelling phlegm. The method of preparation is the same as before. Moreover, the meaning of &quot;embracing the dragon&quot; is to protect, with the dragon representing the liver. The liver corresponds to the eastern azure dragon of wood; wood generates fire, which symbolizes the nurturing parents. The liver is the mother, and the heart is the child; if the mother is stable, so shall the child be peaceful. The heart stores the spirit, and the liver stores the soul; if the spirit and soul are settled, where can anxiety arise? Thus, it is said that &quot;Embracing Dragon Pill&quot; treats various disturbances in children, such as seasonal colds from wind and cold, warm epidemic heat causing restlessness, phlegm cough with breathlessness, and prevention of emerging sores and rashes, all suitable for administration. Its medicinal nature is warm and balanced, not harsh or drying. Regular use disperses wind, transforms phlegm, calms the heart, relieves heat, harmonizes the spleen and stomach, and nourishes the spirit.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br><strong>Baolong Pill</strong>: The word &quot;hold&quot; refers to nurturing. The dragon represents pure Yang energy; it corresponds to thunder and is associated with the wood of the east, symbolizing the energy of lesser Yang. When spring arrives, it marks the beginning of the emergence of all things. The character &quot;Yi&quot; represents the liver and wood, with the liver governing wind and embodying the image of a newborn child, which is pure Yang without Yin. The liver is characterized by excess, and the energy of lesser Yang is strong. The liver governs wind; when children are ill, they may experience heat, and heat can give rise to wind. A skilled physician considers this, creating this formula to balance the liver wood and prevent convulsions; hence, the name &quot;hold the dragon.&quot; This medicine is essential for children to nourish their Yin and support them, ensuring balance. Furthermore, the azure dragon corresponds to the liver wood, and as children&#39;s livers often have excess while their spleens are generally deficient, this medicine curbs the liver and strengthens the spleen, thus named &quot;hold the dragon.&quot; It treats conditions of strong heat, drowsiness with coarse breath, or coughs caused by phlegm and convulsions.</p>

<ul>
<li>6 grams of Angelica  </li>
<li>6 grams of Bupleurum  </li>
<li>6 grams of tangerine peel  </li>
<li>6 grams of stir-fried bitter orange  </li>

<li>8 grams of stir-fried white peony  </li>
<li>4 grams of licorice  </li>
<li>4 grams of stir-fried Coptis  </li>
<li>3 grams of mint<br>Take 2 taels of the mixture, boiled with ginger water.<br>Xu Ji states: If the symptoms arise from wind-heat in the liver channel, the above prescription is appropriate. If they arise from blood dryness in the liver channel, the Six-Ingredient Pill should be used. If the liver wood impairs the spleen earth, the Four Gentlemen Decoction with the addition of Cimicifuga and Bupleurum is indicated. If lung metal damages liver wood, use the Xie Bai Powder. If kidney water cannot nourish liver wood, the Six-Ingredient Pill is advised. Should the patient experience palpitations and insomnia after recovery, or exhibit convulsions and teeth grinding during sleep, Gui Pi Decoction supplemented with Poria and Schisandra should be applied. The excess indicates a strong pathogenic factor; the deficiency indicates a weakness in true qi.<a id="trans-243p" href="#orig-243p" class="marker">[243p]</a><br>For any illness characterized by excess, one should consider it as deficiency. The classics say: &quot;Where evil gathers, the vital energy must be weak.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, to treat children with deficiencies in the spleen and stomach, where the Earth is defeated and the Wood dominates, observe if the eyes are slightly moving, the limbs are slightly twitching, or if there are alternating fevers. This indicates injury to the spleen and stomach, with diminished appetite, and possibly diarrhea or vomiting, pale complexion, weak pulse; thus, it is necessary to tonify the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>The prescription includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>1.3 grams of Atractylodes </li>
<li>Honey-fried Astragalus </li>
<li>5 grams of Chuan Xiong </li>
<li>Wine-washed Angelica </li>
<li>5 grams of dried Tangerine Peel </li>
<li>5 grams of Ginseng </li>
<li>5 grams of roasted Nutmeg </li>
<li>5 grams of Massa Fermentata </li>
<li>7 grams of dried Kudzu Root </li>
<li>1 gram of White Peony, stir-fried in wine </li>
<li>4 grams of Coptis </li>
<li>4 grams of Licorice </li>
<li>7 grams of Pinellia </li>
<li>7 grams of White Poria</li>
</ul>
<p>These are to be decocted in ginger water for consumption. Xue Ji states: In my humble opinion, if the condition arises from spleen and stomach weakness, it should be supplemented with the Five Flavor Decoction. If there is cold deficiency, add Wood Fragrance, or further add roasted Ginger to warm it. If it is due to the descent of spleen qi, use the Middle-Established Energy-Boosting Decoction. For thirst, use the Seven Flavor Atractylodes Powder. If it is due to spleen and stomach weakness with cold water dominating the Earth, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Wood Fragrance and roasted Ginger to warm it. If it arises from spleen and stomach weakness with Liver Wood oppressing the Earth, use the Middle-Established Energy-Boosting Decoction plus Poria, Peony, and Pinellia to adjust.<a id="trans-244p" href="#orig-244p" class="marker">[244p]</a><br>If the liver wood is excessive, leading to restriction of the spleen earth, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with roasted gardenia. If due to injury from fish and meat, use Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding hawthorn and cardamom to dispel it. If caused by injury from cold leading to abdominal pain or clear diarrhea, Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used with cardamom, costus, and roasted ginger to warm it. If caused by an injury from pungent heat, resulting in stagnant vomiting of sour fluids or loose stools, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with Huang Lian, Wu Zhu Yu, and costus to harmonize it. If accumulation leads to persistent diarrhea, use Four Gentlemen Decoction with nutmeg, cheesy fruit, costus, and ginger to nourish the spleen and kidneys. If diarrhea stops but appetite diminishes, use Baizhu Powder to strengthen the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Additionally, to treat children with heart and blood deficiency, causing insomnia and fright, focus on clearing the heart, calming the spirit, and resolving phlegm. Ingredients include: one qian each of ginseng, pinellia, and fried sour jujube seeds; seven fen each of angelica wine-washed, citrus peel, and red peony; five grains of five-flavored fruit; three fen of roasted licorice. Prepare with water, adding a little ginger juice and bamboo juice. A half-fen of ox gall can enhance the effectiveness.<a id="trans-245p" href="#orig-245p" class="marker">[245p]</a><br>If experiencing a warm heart with excessive heat in the heart, add five parts of raw Rehmannia and gardenia fruit, seven parts of Ophiopogon, and bamboo leaves. If the condition of food stagnation due to fright occurs, it is necessary to first resolve the food stagnation and then address the fright. Add white atractylodes and malt to the fright remedy to regulate the spleen and stomach. When fright disperses qi, it is essential to gather and replenish the qi; when fright causes phlegm aggregation, it is necessary to resolve the phlegm. Xue Ji stated: In cases with insufficient heart blood and heart spirit agitation, this formula should be used. If excessive wood and fire disturb the heart spirit, use the Dao Chi San. If wood and fire combine with wind-heat causing illness, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San. If the liver and heart are weak, with wood and fire unresolved leading to illness, use the Liu Wei Wan. If phlegm arises from stagnated spleen and stomach due to food, causing agitation, use the Si Jun Zi Tang to strengthen the spleen, along with Shen Qu, Ban Xia, and malt to transform phlegm, and add gardenia and peony to clear heat. If food stagnation leads to abdominal bloating, vomiting, or diarrhea, use the Liu Jun Zi Tang to strengthen the spleen, adding hou po and shen qu to aid digestion. If there&#39;s phlegm causing fright, continue using the original formula for treatment. If symptoms of the liver channel are present, add vine hook and replace red peony with white peony in the formula.<a id="trans-246p" href="#orig-246p" class="marker">[246p]</a><br>Anshen Zhenjing Pill is a remedy for calming the spirit, nourishing the blood after shock, and preventing future disturbances.

<p>This mixture is ground into a powder and made into pills the size of soybeans, to be taken with light ginger tea, three to five pills each time. </p>
<p>Xue Ji states: In my humble opinion, this formula fundamentally aims at treatment and prevention. However, it contains many bitter, cold, and acrid ingredients which may be harmful if used lightly after illness, as they could damage the stomach&#39;s energy and lead to other ailments. If there are symptoms arising from food stagnation, the main focus should be on elimination. If there are symptoms due to damage to the spleen and stomach, the emphasis should be on strengthening the middle energy. Generally speaking, if the vital energy has not yet recovered after illness, or if it has been further harmed by purging remedies, the focus should be on promoting and replenishing the yang energy, allowing symptoms to self-resolve, as targeting the illness directly may lead to errors.<a id="trans-247p" href="#orig-247p" class="marker">[247p]</a><br><strong>Di Huang Wan</strong></p>

For children, take with warm mint juice as preferred, without restriction on time. This is the method from the Yan family and the Zong family of Qian for treating prolonged fright, suitable for those with weak pulses. The method incorporates Qingzhou white pills mixed with different efficacy powders, Qianghuo ointments, warm white pills, and similar formulas, frequently rescuing from death. The Tang family states: in cases of vomiting and diarrhea leading to wind-related weakness of the spleen, first use the Fostering Life Powder, Qingzhou white pills ground into powder, boiled into a thin paste, mixed with honey and taken to control salivation, and then take other medicines to dispel wind and awaken the spleen.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br>Ba Xian San: For those with a strong wind condition.</p>

<p>Directions: Grind the above ingredients, taking one qian (a unit of weight) for each dose, with half a cup of water, two slices of ginger, and half a date.

<p>Directions: Use half the amount of cloves. Grind the ingredients and take four qian per dose, with one bowl of water, ten slices of ginger, ten leaves of perilla, and three dates. Boil down to half a bowl. After the wet nurse eats, she must remove all the milk before taking it. Immediately lie on her back for a moment to let the medicine enter the milk channels, then let the baby suck a few times but do not let it become overly full; this is the correct method. </p>
<p>If vomiting persists for a day, it is urgent to dispel wind by taking Ba Xian San. Two days later, it is advisable to follow with Xiang Pi San. If none of the previous medicines work and there is danger, one must check the Tai Chong pulse to see if it is not completely closed and then should moxibustion on the Baihui point. The point is located at the midpoint between the hairline at the front and the tips of both ears.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a><br>The text states that it only mentions the top of the head with spiral hair, but does not explain the existence of double tops or irregular spirals. Many mediocre physicians, adhering to old texts, often mislead people. After moxibustion, one should control saliva using a powder made from Qingzhou white pills; after simmering it to a thin paste, mix in refined honey and a lethal powder, which will eventually help salivation. Finely grind spirit sand and mix it with rice drink to apply in the mouth, gradually observing the retreat of symptoms. If there&#39;s a strong wind, take Eight Immortals Powder; if feeling drowsy, use Wake the Spleen Powder. Regularly reducing mother’s milk and having the mother take fermented milk medicine, this form of regulation leads to recovery for everyone. However, if there is a deficiency in constitution or if the five elements are imbalanced, even skilled practitioners may not overpower destiny. If the saliva has already left the diaphragm and is stuck in the throat like a saw, medications cannot enter and cannot be controlled; alternative methods must be used to stimulate its release, alongside inducing sneezing through the nose, and then taking the lethal powder to avoid recurrence.<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm-Lifting Formula</strong><br>Seven pieces each of Chuanwu and Baifuxin, peeled and used fresh; seven scorpions; a small amount of stone green.

This is a treatment method by the Tang family for chronic fright. First, use Duoming Powder and Ba Wanzi to control phlegm, wait for the phlegm to descend once, then use Baxian to awaken the spleen again, allowing the wet nurse to use the milk fermentation method. For critical cases, one should apply moxibustion to Baihui and the phlegm-lifting method, but for Duoming, use lunstone. For those with deficient qi, it&#39;s challenging to use; must be combined with Dongyuan&#39;s Yihuang Powder. Chen said: For treating chronic fright wind, first use Xiongxie Powder to manually expel cold phlegm and cold salivation, so that one won&#39;t be delirious; then take Youzhu Ointment; afterward, take Yizhen Decoction to warm and strengthen the original qi; occasionally take the previous Pusa Powder to relieve excess above and deficiency below.<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a><br><strong>Xuanguo San</strong> treats children’s brain and marrow affected by wind, releasing pressure from the skull, and alleviating tightness in the skin, flesh, tendons, and meridians.

<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wei Ling Xian (Some type of herb, 1.5 taels), finely ground and roasted until dry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 3 taels of soap pod, remove the skin and strings, pound it, and then mix with one bowl of warm water. Filter through silk, and simmer over low heat until it becomes a thin paste. </li>
<li>Add half a tael of strong vinegar, simmer for another three to five boils, remove from heat, cool it down, and mix the prepared herbal powder evenly in a mortar, forming pills the size of a chestnut. </li>
<li>First, rub the roots of the teeth with salt and plum meat; then take one or two pills, mix with warm, concentrated white soup, and apply into both sides of the jaws until they open; continue with other medicines.</li>

<p>Note: When boiling, the use of earthenware is preferred; silver is even better. For phlegm stagnation, use light ginger soup for dissolution, administered at any time. For swollen and painful throat, drink warm tea or light lotus leaf soup. </p>
<p>These methods are effective for treating both acute and chronic wind conditions, addressing both deficiency and excess, hence the method for universal treatment.

<p>When it comes down to specifics, substances related to stones help eliminate phlegm, those with indigo relieve wood-related blockages, and cinnabar addresses fire-related issues, all are effective against Qi stagnation. Ginseng and licorice help tonify the earth, while Tianma and whole scorpion nourish wood, and black and Aconite root nourish fire; all serve to remedy Qi deficiency.

For children&#39;s convulsions, needle the Shen and the points at the top of the head, Hui meeting point, and Tianzhu point. If there are backward gazes, needle the Linqi point. </p>
<p>For children with convulsions and urgent spasm of the spine, and forced upward gaze, needle where the muscles are tense. For convulsions in children where the spine is tight and symptoms interact, needle the Changqiang point. </p>

Pressing on it does not alleviate the discomfort, leading to sadness and panting, and this is governed by Kunlun. </p>
<p>In &quot;Qianjin Fang,&quot; Sun Simiao of the Tang dynasty states that a newborn child should never be subjected to reverse acupuncture. If done in reverse, the child will endure pain, disturbing the flow of the five vessels, which may lead to seizures. The land in the He and Luo regions is cold, and children are prone to convulsions; often, reverse acupuncture is used to prevent this. Additionally, moxibustion on the cheeks is used to prevent locking of the jaw. In cases of jaw locking, the pulse under the tongue is rapid, and the muscles in the teeth are tense. The cold conditions of the land lead to bleeding under the tongue and moxibustion on the cheeks to prevent jaw locking. In the warmer regions of Wu and Shu, this condition does not occur. </p>
<p>The ancient methods have been passed down, but modern practitioners do not pay attention to the differences between the north and south, resulting in harm to many children. Therefore, peasant children are allowed to grow naturally without dying prematurely. </p>
<p>When a child is shocked and cries, their limbs may twitch in sleep, and if they have not resolved the prior steam condition, do not perform acupuncture on their claws, as this could disturb the hundred vessels and lead to seizures. Only in cases of yin-type seizures and jaw locking is it acceptable to use acupuncture on the claws. In general, when moxibustion is applied for seizures, it should first be done to induce a state of deficiency in the child, and then the moxibustion is applied when the child is in a state of emptiness.

<p>In total, there are nineteen points on the head; for children who are ten days old, three treatments can be applied; at thirty days, five treatments; and at fifty days, seven treatments. For severe illnesses, all points should be treated; for mild conditions, only the Baihui, Fengchi, and Yuzhen points should be treated. Use moxa that is dried, and apply the roll evenly onto the skin, allowing the heat to reach the afflicted area. If the moxa is wet, the rolls will not be evenly applied and will not contact the skin, leading to excessive burning without any benefits.<a id="trans-363p" href="#orig-363p" class="marker">[363p]</a><br>If there is fullness in the abdomen with shortness of breath and gurgling sounds, moxibustion should be applied to the lung region, specifically on the second rib between the two breasts. Locate this point carefully. Next, perform moxibustion on the middle of the chest, then at the navel, and subsequently at the Xuexi point, which is located in the middle between the two breasts at the first rib. Following that, apply moxibustion at the Jueque point, which is one inch below the tailbone for adults, and six-tenths below the navel for children, also one inch below the tailbone. Apply moxibustion on both sides as well. Then, moxibustion on the stomach conduit, and on the Jinmen point, which is found in front of the valley, located centrally behind the bladder. Measure from below the scrotum to the front of the perineum at the midpoint.</p>
<p>For the twelve points on the right abdomen—the chest area, Jueque, and the stomach conduit—apply moxibustion three times for children under ten days old and five times for those over a month. In the region above the genitals, three times may be suitable, or some say according to age.</p>
<p>If there is a strong curvature in the spine, moxibustion should be applied to the Dazhui point and to the associated organ points along the spine centrally. The Dazhui can be measured down to the base of the spine; from the Dazhui point, continue measuring downwards to perform moxibustion at the top of the spine.</p>
<p>For the twelve points on the right back, children under ten days should receive moxibustion three times, and those over a month can have it five times.</p>
<p>If there are spasms in the hands and feet or if there is shock, perform moxibustion on the Chi Ze point, followed by the Yangming point, then on the Shaoshang, upon the Laoguan, on the Xin Zhu point, at the Hegu point, and lastly on the three Intersections. </p>
<p>For the right hand, there are sixteen important points, particularly Yangming, Shaoshang, Xin Zhu, Chi Ze, Hegu, and Shaoyang, with the number of applications as mentioned above.<a id="trans-364p" href="#orig-364p" class="marker">[364p]</a><br>Again, moxibustion is applied to the rabbit&#39;s back, then to the Sanli point, then to the calf, then to the Luci point, then to the Yangming point, then to the Shaoyang point, and then to the Rangu point. </p>
<p>The fourteen places on the right foot are all essential; they can be treated with moxibustion, and the intensity should be as mentioned above. </p>
<p>The Hand-foot Yangming refers to the four fingers; for all children experiencing fright or convulsions, moxibustion should be applied to these areas. If a severe wind condition causes spasms in the hands and feet, then moxibustion should be applied to all ten fingertips and the joints behind them.</p>
<p>Dou Hanjing in &quot;Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers&quot; states: For chronic fright, use a spoonful of soy sauce and apply it to the Baihui point, with moxibustion using mugwort leaves the size of half a yellow bean, performing moxibustion five times as a standard. Within these five times, the order does not matter. </p>
<p>If an infant cries in a way that is no different from usual, they will live; if their cry is hoarse and unnatural, they will die, as proven repeatedly. The Baihui point is located at the crown of the head, at the heart of where the hair spirals.<a id="trans-365p" href="#orig-365p" class="marker">[365p]</a><br>For infants, even if there are no signs of fright during the month, performing moxibustion according to the method can prevent lifelong fears. Moxibustion for diarrhea is also effective. The &quot;Complete Book of Pediatrics&quot; states: whenever acute convulsions occur with the jaw clenched and unresponsive, immediately use moxa on the middle fingers of both hands, bringing them together to apply the heat, which will awaken the child, after which treatment can be administered. First, bring the thumbs together and burn one or two moxa sticks at the lateral edges of the nails; then, bring the middle fingers together and burn one or two moxa sticks at the center of the nail seams to awaken them. If there is no reaction to the moxibustion, do not administer treatment. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: for acute fright in children, needle the small point. For fright with crying, do moxibustion at the Baihui point, or needle the Shenmen point with three-tenths and do three strong moxibustions. For chronic fright in children, do moxibustion at the Shizhe and Yintang points with three strong applications each: Shizhe is found in the hollow above the elbow crease along the transverse elbow line, where the Taiyin Lung meridian enters, to relieve lung excess.<a id="trans-366p" href="#orig-366p" class="marker">[366p]</a><br>For children with convulsions, needle the Yanggu point for two minutes and moxibustion for three applications. Yanggu is located on the outer side of the wrist, in the hollow beneath the sharp bone, corresponding to the Hand Taiyang Large Intestine channel.</p>
<p>For children with tics and convulsions, needle the Kunlun point for three minutes and moxibustion for three applications. Kunlun is found behind the outer ankle at the hollow above the heel bone, where a fine pulse can be felt; it corresponds to the Foot Taiyang Bladder channel. Alternatively, needle the Zhi pulse for one minute and moxibustion for three applications. The Zhi pulse is also known as the Zi pulse, located at the back of the ear near the chicken-foot-like blue network. One may also needle the front fontanel for one minute and apply moxibustion for three applications; the front fontanel is found between the bones one and a half inches behind the vertex.</p>
<p>For children who vomit and have diarrhea intermittently, exhibit fright and eye irritation, or have sticky phlegm, needle the Zhi pulse for one minute and moxibustion for three applications. The Zhi pulse is known as the Zi pulse, located at the back of the ear near the chicken-foot-like blue network; needle until blood flows like bean juice, taking care not to draw too much.</p>
<p>For children with wind convulsions, where the body is arched backward, apply moxibustion to the Shenque point for three applications; do not needle. The Shenque, also known as the Qi Residence, is located at the center of the navel.</p>
<p>For children who vomit, exhibit convulsions, have body heat and headaches, cannot lie down, have ear swelling and pus, apply moxibustion to the Xu point at the back of the ear for seven applications; do not needle. The Xu point is found in the middle of the ear&#39;s back network.</p>
<p>For children who open their mouths, shake their heads, and arch their bodies, needle the Jinmen point for one minute and apply moxibustion for three applications.<a id="trans-367p" href="#orig-367p" class="marker">[367p]</a><br>In Jinmen, there is a point named Liangguan, located one inch below the outer ankle and one inch below the Shen pulse, corresponding to the foot Taiyang. This point belongs to the Yangwei channel.</p>
<p>For children with epilepsy, use acupuncture at Changqiang point, three-tenths of an inch deep, and moxibustion should be performed five times. Changqiang, also known as Qi&#39;s Yinxi, is located at the end of the sacral bone, three-tenths of an inch deep; you can access it while lying down. This point connects the foot Shaoyin and Shaoyang, which further communicates with the Governing Vessel and diverges to the Conception Vessel.</p>
<p>When children are startled from sleep, perform moxibustion at the tips of the big toe and the second toe, removing the nail like a leaf of chives. Each should be treated five times. </p>
<p>For children with a strong body, who exhibit a bowing posture, moxibustion should be performed three-tenths of an inch above the nose, near the hairline, done five times, followed by five treatments on the lower segment of Dazhui.</p>
<p>For children with sudden fright, moxibustion should be applied at the front top point three times, located one inch before Baihui; if not cured, also moxibustion the center of the eyebrows and the Philtrum below the nose at one spot, each the size of a wheat grain.</p>
<p>For children suffering from persistent fright during sleep, where the eyes don&#39;t align, moxibustion should be done three-tenths of an inch above the crease in the elbow, each treated once. </p>
<p>Epilepsy is a serious disease in children; in moments of breathing difficulty, one often cannot seek help, leading to many fatalities. As the saying goes: &quot;In this world, there are no good doctors; half of the dead have died in vain.&quot; </p>
<p>For various forms of childhood epilepsy, when the child has a foul mouth and foams at the mouth, perform moxibustion at the Jueque point, treated three times, located one inch below the tailbone.<a id="trans-368p" href="#orig-368p" class="marker">[368p]</a><br>Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: For children with epilepsy and symptoms of fright and dizziness, moxibustion should be applied to the Shenting acupoint seven times, located five fen straight up from the nasal bridge to the hairline. For children with chicken epilepsy, who often experience fright and have eye twitching or head shaking, moxibustion should be done on the Shaoyin acupoint two times, located half an inch from the wrist on the back of the hand. For children suffering from fright-induced epilepsy, which begins with a startling shout, moxibustion should be applied three times to the center of the crown and to the vein behind the ear, with each moxa stick being the size of a grain of wheat. For children with food-related epilepsy, which starts with chills and fever, moxibustion should be done three times five fen above the Jiuwei acupoint. For children with cow epilepsy, who have a fixed gaze and abdominal distension, moxibustion should be applied three times to the Jiuwei acupoint, located five fen beneath the chest bone at the midpoint. For children with horse epilepsy, who open their mouths and shake their heads or bend their bodies as if neighing, moxibustion should be administered three times to the Puxin acupoint, located in the depression under the heel bone at the edge of the white flesh, accessed by curving the foot. For children with sheep epilepsy, who have bulging eyes and stick out their tongues in a bleating manner, moxibustion should be applied three to five times at the interval beneath the ninth vertebra. According to the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; it states: Extreme convulsions lead to an inability to stand; one should take action at Tianzhu. The Tianzhu acupoint corresponds to the foot&#39;s sun meridian. It also notes that for epilepsy, the specific affliction is unknown; moxibustion should be applied below the two arches — the male being yang and the female being yin.<a id="trans-369p" href="#orig-369p" class="marker">[369p]</a><br>Jie Gu said: During the day, moxibustion is applied to the Yang qiao, and at night to the Yin qiao, each with two strong applications. The Yang qiao starts at the center of the heel and ascends along the inner ankle to the throat, connecting with the Chong meridian at the Zhuhai point. Li Zhan in &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: For children with convulsions, moxibustion is applied to the Ben Shen point one and a half inches from the lateral tear. For children with epilepsy, moxibustion is done one and a half inches above the Xia Huo point with three needles and three strong applications. The &quot;Body Classics Comprehensive Examination&quot; says: For sudden convulsions in children, moxibustion is applied one inch in front of the Baihui point; if it does not heal, three strong applications on each shoulder and the philtrum with a size of a small wheat grain. The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; says: For a backward arched neck, apply moxibustion three strong applications three points above the hairline on the nose, and three strong applications between the lower segment of the Dazhui. The &quot;Wang Rixin&#39;s Pediatric Formulas&quot; states: For children who cry out and then suddenly die from convulsions, it is called &quot;Old Crow Shock,&quot; using hemp rope to bind the sides and palms of the hands and feet, igniting them with fire; using dried Old Crow garlic and cheqianzi mixed into powder, adjusting with water and applying to the palms. Then, using the wick of the lamp to apply fire to the palms, shoulders, mid-brow, and center of the nose will awaken the child. The &quot;Secret of Pediatric Convulsions&quot; states: For all cases of convulsions in children with confusion, spasms, and viewing troubles, as well as headaches with fullness and pain, apply lamp wick dipped in sesame oil to the temples where the major vessels are prominent. For those who look up and do not lower their eyes, apply fire above and below the navel.<a id="trans-370p" href="#orig-370p" class="marker">[370p]</a><br>For those who lose consciousness, apply heat to the upper and lower parts of their hands and feet. For a fist that cannot open and is directed upwards, apply heat to the crown of the head and the palms of both hands. If they are foaming at the mouth, apply heat to their mouth and the soles and palms. In the case of a child who has a sudden convulsion and their entire body turns black, this condition is called &quot;black gauze fright.&quot; Quickly push down on them, grind a bowl of yellow earth into a fine powder, mix it with a cup of aged vinegar, heat it, and apply it while wrapped up, letting it pull down to the feet, and puncture it for best effect.<a id="trans-371p" href="#orig-371p" class="marker">[371p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The book by Qian on pediatric diagnosis states: &quot;In the residence of the Qian family, regarding the case of the seven-year-old Tawei Fang, who had been suffering from tidal fever for several days and wanted to recover, Qian told his father, the Great King, &#39;The seventh (method) will cure the tidal fever, but the eighth (method) is for preventing convulsions.&#39; The king was angry, saying: &#39;Only let the seventh cure him; do not speak of the eighth causing sickness.&#39; Qian replied: &#39;The eighth method will surely occur tomorrow at noon without suffering.&#39; The next day, before noon, convulsions indeed appeared, leading to an urgent call for Qian to treat him, and he recovered in three days. He foresaw that the child’s eyes were straight and his cheeks were red, indicating that both the liver and heart were overheated. He then sat on a stone stool seeking coolness; this heat was excessive. Also, the skin was plump and firm, and the pulse was rapid, hence the convulsions emerged. He explained that noon refers to the time from the tiger (3 AM) to noon, when the heart and liver are most active; thus, treatment involved draining the heart and liver while tonifying the kidneys, leading to peace.&quot;</p>
<p>In another case, Li Sihu’s grandson experienced convulsions a hundred days after birth, occurring three to five times a day. Treatment was given for fetal fright but did not yield results. Therefore, he used large blue ointment and applied it to the forehead and utilized bathing methods, leading to recovery in three days. This was because the infant&#39;s blood and qi were not yet substantial enough to withstand external evils, resulting in convulsions, thus the necessity of the bathing method. Generally, for frequent convulsions, it is easy to treat if wind is on the surface, and dispersal is recommended; for rare convulsions, it is challenging if wind is internal, hence it is advised to tonify the spleen.</p>
<p>In the case of Zhu Jian&#39;s five-year-old son, who experienced fever at midnight, upon waking, he returned to his usual state. Cooling medicine was given to resolve it, but he ended up producing excessive saliva and enjoyed sleep, with stools being green and white, exhibiting thirst and a desire for drink. The physician said: &quot;This should strengthen the spleen and stomach, allowing the symptoms to recede.&quot; Consequently, a dose of Bai Zhu San (Atractylodes powder) was prepared with one tael of water, and he was allowed to drink two doses. He improved slightly, and after three doses, his thirst ceased and saliva diminished; further doses of Ejiao San were given, and the child settled down.<a id="trans-372p" href="#orig-372p" class="marker">[372p]</a><br>The son of the Xu family, three years old, suffered from tidal fever. Every day at the hour of You (5-7 PM), he experienced convulsions, had a slight fever, and his eyes were slightly turned and showed the whites. His limbs were cold, and he wheezed, with his stool being slightly yellow. The family consulted Qian and Li for treatment. Qian asked Li, “What causes the convulsions?” Li replied, “There is wind.” “Why is there a slight fever?” asked Qian. Li said, “It is due to the condition of the limbs.” “Why are the eyes turned and the whites showing?” asked Qian. Li answered, “Convulsions cause the eyes to turn.” “Why are the limbs cold?” Qian inquired. Li responded, “It is cold contraction with internal heat.” “What about the wheezing?” asked Qian. Li said, “It is due to severe convulsions.” “How shall we treat it?” Qian asked. Li said, “Administer Liangjing pills through the nose; it will certainly stop the convulsions.” </p>
<p>Qian further questioned, “Since you say it is a wind illness, with warmth causing convulsions, eyes turned with whites showing, internal heat with cold limbs, and severe convulsions causing wheezing, what medicine will treat all of these?” Li replied, “It is all treated with this medicine.” Qian insisted, “That can’t be right. The convulsions indicate a strong heart and liver; the slight fever signifies the lung functioning at sunset. The lungs govern warmth; the current warmth indicates lung deficiency. The eyes slightly turned and the whites showing indicate a conflict between the liver and lungs. The cold limbs indicate spleen deficiency. If the lungs are very deficient, then the spleen is also weak. Wood energy overwhelms the spleen, causing the limbs to become cold. To treat it, we must first tonify the spleen and lungs using Yi Huang powder and Ejiao powder, which will reduce the spleen deficiency before addressing the heart and liver with Xie Qing pills and Dao Chi powder. The Liangjing pills will treat it.” After nine days, the child recovered.<a id="trans-373p" href="#orig-373p" class="marker">[373p]</a><br>The prince&#39;s son, five years old, stared straight ahead and did not desire food. Some believed it was a ghostly disturbance and sprayed him with magical water, which only worsened his condition, leading to convulsions. This was a sign of excessive heat in the liver channel, and he was treated with Qingxian pills and recovered.</p>
<p>The son of the Wang family suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, and when medication was given, he slept with his eyes open, and his body felt cold, which indicated chronic fright. Using a bottle gourd soup treated him, and his eyes opened and his body warmed. However, his urination and defecation were not smooth; thus, Ba Zheng powder was administered. If he was still cold and refused food, he was treated with Yihuang powder and Shijunzi pills to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach, and all symptoms resolved. Later, he became mute, and Sheng Di Huang pills were used to tonify the kidneys, and he recovered in half a month.</p>
<p>The son of Li Siling, three years old, had convulsions from the hour of Yin to the hour of Si, looking to the right and crying aloud. Qian Jian said, &quot;This is a reversal.&quot; As a boy represents yang, normally he would look to the left in silence, which signifies a smooth condition; looking to the right with a sound signifies a reversal. This is because the liver belongs to wood on the left and the lungs to metal on the right. A reversal indicates conflict between these organs, resulting in the sound. Treatment should aim to drain the strong and nourish the weak. </p>
<p>For example, if a girl has convulsions and looks to the left, it suggests the lungs are disturbing the liver, which cannot tolerate it, thus causing the crying. In this case, the lung should be drained, and then the heart and liver treated subsequently. If the disease arises in the fall (during a similar time in the west), when the lungs are in a dominant position, the lungs should be strongly drained. If the disease occurs in spring (during the same time in the morning), when the liver is dominant, it cannot subdue the lungs, meaning the lungs are strong and the liver fire weak. Therefore, the liver and kidneys should be nourished while draining the lungs. If a boy has convulsions and looks to the right, it indicates the liver is overpowering the lungs and causing the crying, so the liver and heart should be drained.<a id="trans-374p" href="#orig-374p" class="marker">[374p]</a><br>If the illness occurs in spring or summer, during the morning or midday when the liver and heart are strong, one should greatly purge the liver. If the illness occurs in autumn or winter, during the evening when the lungs are dominant, and cannot bear the strength of the liver, the liver is strong while the lungs are extremely deficient; thus, one should nourish the lungs and greatly purge the liver. Therefore, it is said that the eyes reflecting vision relate to the liver. In general, convulsions indicate internal conflict between wind and heat; since wind pertains to the liver, it manifests outwardly in the eyes. In this case, one should first purge the lungs using a lung-purging decoction. If after two days there is no agitation or confusion, it indicates the illness is receding. Afterwards, use Shudihuang pills to nourish the kidneys, and after three doses, utilize Xieqing pills, each two doses, to purge the heart and liver, and recovery will happen in five days. However, it is said that this condition is more common in males than in females, hence males are easier to treat than females. For example, if a female has convulsions and her eyes look to the left, the power of the lungs suppresses the liver, and if it occurs in autumn, when the lungs dominate and the liver cannot manage, it causes crying and shouting; thus, one should significantly purge the lungs first, then treat the heart and restore the liver. So it is said that if males have their eyes looking to the right, wood offends metal, the liver is strong against the lungs, and one should purge the liver. If the illness occurs again in spring or summer, when metal energy is extremely deficient, one should nourish the lungs, being careful not to purge.<a id="trans-375p" href="#orig-375p" class="marker">[375p]</a><br>In &quot;The Complete Book on Sores and Ulcers&quot; by Dou Hanqing, it is stated: A young boy, seven years old, would faint upon hearing thunder, losing awareness of his surroundings. Using ginseng, goji berries, and Ophiopogon, he was given a small amount mixed with five flavors, consuming a pound of it, and afterwards he was unaffected by thunder.</p>
<p>In &quot;Confucianism and Caring for Parents&quot; by Zhang Congzheng, it is mentioned: A young boy from the Li family had convulsions in his hands and feet, which he demonstrated to a person named Dai. Dai said: &quot;It is due to excess heart fire. Do not hold his hands; you should let the convulsions continue.&quot; This was caused by the wetness from his nurse&#39;s holding while he was in the womb. He was advised to sweep and sprinkle water on the ground, ensuring it was very moist, then lay the child on the ground for a long time, allowing him to roll and turn, getting covered in mud as if washed in water. After a while, he was cured.</p>
<p>Li Dongyuan states: A girl from the Chen family, at eight years old, contracted convulsions. It would worsen in damp weather or if she was startled, producing drool and making sounds like a bleating sheep. Upon examination, I concluded that this was due to fright during pregnancy, and the ailment was deeply rooted. After six months of treatment, the condition improved, but she still required bland flavors to assist the medicine&#39;s efficacy. I provided her with Dan Pill, followed by Si Wu Decoction with added Coptis, adjusting as needed, and after half a year, she was stable.</p>
<p>Danchi&#39;s principles say: A granddaughter suffered from damp-heat during pregnancy, experiencing convulsions at noon, with dark lips and a pale face, having a seizure daily. After less than half a month without effective medication, she was given a concoction with milk made from 0.5 tael each of Atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, Pinellia, peony, and green tangerine peel, along with 0.3 tael each of ginseng and Chengqing, 0.2 tael of Coptis, 0.1 tael of honey-fried licorice, divided into eight doses, with five slices of ginger, to be prepared and consumed by the nurse.<a id="trans-376p" href="#orig-376p" class="marker">[376p]</a><br>Luo Tianyi&#39;s &quot;Treasures of Health&quot; states: Wei Jingfu&#39;s son was four years old, and an elder rubbed his head to give a prophecy. The gathered monks recited incantations, which caused the child to be greatly frightened, leading to spasms, phlegm blockage, excessive white in the eyes, and a tense neck and back, with a phlegm-like voice in the throat. After a while, he seemed better. However, he would become frightened upon seeing people in black clothing, and he frequently took medications with realgar and dragon&#39;s brain for calming. After more than forty days, the symptoms persisted, and he began to walk and act in a dazed manner, so I was ordered to treat him. I diagnosed his pulse as deep, wiry, and rapid. The &quot;Huangdi Needle Classic&quot; states: &quot;A full heart pulse indicates epilepsy and convulsions,&quot; and &quot;The liver pulse is small and rapid, indicating epilepsy and convulsions.&quot; This is because a child&#39;s blood and qi are not yet stable, and their spirit is still weak. Thus, fear and fright arise, causing disturbances in the liver, which governs the tendons, leading to convulsions. After a prolonged illness, the qi weakens; children are more prone to vacuity and repletion. Taking too many calming medications further weakens their qi, hence the dazed walking and actions. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: &quot;Violent spasms during epilepsy—when the feet cannot support the body, one should needle the Tianzhu point.&quot; The Tianzhu point is where the Yang channels of the foot emerge. It further states: &quot;For convulsions and epilepsy that are unclear, the two yang feet are the main points, with male corresponding to yang and female to yin.&quot; The venerable Elder Jie Gu said: &quot;For daytime seizures, needle the Yang qiao in the Shen pulse; for night seizures, needle the Yin qiao in the Zhaohai point. First, moxa both points for two seven times.&quot; The Yang qiao Shen pulse point lies in the depression below the outer ankle, at the junction of the white flesh beneath the toenail, while the Yin qiao Zhaohai point is located in the depression below the inner ankle. Following this, I used a formula of fragrant agarwood and Tianma, and after taking three doses, he was completely cured.<a id="trans-377p" href="#orig-377p" class="marker">[377p]</a><br>Wang&#39;s &quot;Exploration of Pediatric Science&quot; states: In Yingshan County, the chief official Wu Qingxi suffered from convulsions, and various doctors attempted to treat it as a wind disorder, but to no effect. They urgently sent someone to request my help. When I went to see him, I said: &quot;It is not wind; rather, it is caused by fright. Wind is treated through the liver, while fright is treated through the heart. If one does not recognize the root cause of the illness, how can treatment be effective?&quot; I then administered the most revered life-preserving elixir, and the convulsions ceased. The official said: &quot;The name is not in vain; you are indeed an excellent physician.&quot;<a id="trans-378p" href="#orig-378p" class="marker">[378p]</a><br>A young child, after being startled, developed epilepsy. I formulated a prescription: First, take one measure of heavenly water powder and grind it into a fine powder, dividing it into three doses. The first dose comprises 2.3 liang, mixed with 0.5 liang of genuine indigo powder, named &quot;Qinghun San&quot; (Quelling Soul Powder), to be brewed with bamboo leaf soup at the Yin and Mao hours, taking 1 qian to calm the liver fire. The second dose, also 2.3 liang, mixed with 0.5 liang of mercury powder, is named &quot;Anshen San&quot; (Calming Spirit Powder), to be brewed with lamp grass soup at the Si and Wu hours, taken to steady the spirit. The third dose, again 2.3 liang, mixed with 0.2 liang of genuine light powder, is named &quot;Dinghun San&quot; (Settling Soul Powder), to be brewed with light ginger soup at the Shen and You hours, taken to expel phlegm. After ten days, the child became stable.</p>
<p>There was a ten-year-old child who had suffered from epilepsy for a long time. Upon examination, his eyes appeared murky and lacked brightness, he spoke with difficulty, and his actions were dull and distracted. I told his father: &quot;It is not curable.&quot; Later, they sought medical treatment, but ultimately, there was no success. </p>
<p>In our county, there was a child from Wang Qianchuan suffering from shock illness, experiencing two to three episodes in one month. I stated: &quot;If not treated, it will surely develop into epilepsy.&quot; They sought my treatment, so I established a prescription using equal parts of bitter orange, coptis, pinellia, and white poria, halved, along with the mercury powder, halved again, ground together as before, and then made into pills the size of Chinese water chestnuts, coated with mercury powder. Each dose consisted of one pill, inserted into a pig&#39;s heart that had been cut open, secured with string, placed in a clay pot, boiled until cooked, and then the pig&#39;s heart was consumed with the medicine, accompanied by soup. After this treatment, the child did not experience further episodes, and I named it &quot;Duanqian Wan&quot; (Breaking Epilepsy Pill).<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a><br>In the old county, Zhang Yuanshan’s eldest son fell seriously ill with a sudden convulsion and did not awaken for seventeen days. When I was called, his tongue was black.

I said, &quot;He can be treated.&quot; I then prescribed the Xieqing Pill, two qian, brewed as a decoction for him to drink in one go, and his dry throat and thirst ceased. That night, the convulsion stopped, the fever retreated, and he rested peacefully. If this son had not encountered me, he would have nearly died.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanzhen’s youngest son fell ill in July due to eating improperly and contracted a fever, having convulsions for seven days. I observed that although the liver wind was severe, the spleen was not yet exhausted; thus, I needed to clear his liver and then replenish his spleen. I prescribed a liver-clearing powder in three doses, and the convulsions ceased. Later, I used a regulating herbal decoction to replenish his spleen and the Amber Baolong Pill to pacify his liver. He enjoyed sleep, but could not open his eyes. I thought that if he liked to sleep, it was not due to spleen exhaustion, but rather due to a dull spirit. The eyes are related to the liver, and the pupils to the spleen. If he could not open his eyes, it wasn’t that his soul was lost, but rather that his spirit was weary. Now, if he wished to open and close his eyes, it was evident. I used the previous formula again, and after two days, I instructed his family, who usually played with him, to bring small drums and cymbals into his room and sing and dance before his bed to create some noise. Within half a day, his eyes opened, and he gradually recovered. In total, he was stable after ten days.<a id="trans-380p" href="#orig-380p" class="marker">[380p]</a><br>A woman experienced convulsions for five months. I administered Qing Wan pills, but after three or four doses, her convulsions did not stop and became worse. I suspected that phlegm and stagnant qi were causing her convulsions. The pills were somewhat coarse and had become stuck in her throat with the phlegm, leading to blocked qi and exacerbating her condition. I then prepared a soup from bamboo leaves, filtered it through cotton paper to remove the dregs, and gave her the clarified liquid to drink. Her convulsions ceased and she felt at peace. Her father sighed, saying: &quot;The value of a physician lies in their ability to adapt; indeed, it is so!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a boy whose spleen and stomach were inherently weak. One day, he suffered from diarrhea and was given Li Zhong Wan. However, the diarrhea did not stop, and sores arose in his mouth. I assumed that the previous medicine had a warming property that exacerbated the fire, so I prescribed a cooling remedy. He had slight fever and, when asleep, his eyes were wide open. I observed and said: &quot;This is the onset of subtle convulsions.&quot; The boy&#39;s spleen and stomach were originally weak, and the diarrhea further weakened him. The sores in his mouth indicated that the spleen was deficient and hot. The mistaken use of the cooling remedy caused further harm to his vital energy, leading to lethargy and an inability to nurse, resulting in extreme deficiency. I recommended an urgent treatment using Tiao Yuan Soup with twice the amount of ginseng, and after half a month of regulating his condition, he recovered.<a id="trans-381p" href="#orig-381p" class="marker">[381p]</a><br>In Hu Fengya, a child suffered from smallpox, leading to malnutrition and emaciation. A medical apprentice observed that it was not a symptom of malnutrition but rather blood deficiency. The family was confused. Initially, the child experienced a condition resembling epilepsy but was not actually epilepsy; during the day, he was calm, and at night, he had nightmares, clinging to his wet nurse, crying out, &quot;I’m scared, I’m scared,&quot; as if someone were trying to catch him. Inquiring about the cause of the illness, it was found that the child did not take medicine well; any attempt to administer it would involve frightening him with needles or fire, contributing to his condition. This was because the stomach represented the earth element, while the kidneys represented the water element; when combined, they transformed into fire. The kidneys govern fear, and fear harms the kidneys. This was due to the weakness of the spleen and stomach, which could not nourish the lungs, leading to a deficiency in the kidneys. The kidneys house willpower, and if they are deficient, the spirit cannot be settled, resulting in anxiety and fear. When awake, the spirit resides in the heart; when asleep, it resides in the kidneys, with the spleen acting as the gateway for the will. Thus, the primary treatment should be to nourish the spleen, with calming the spirit as a secondary measure. To nourish the spleen, use Fei Er Wan; to calm the spirit, use Qian&#39;s Anshen Wan. After six months of treatment, the child was at peace. </p>
<p>A seven-month-old child experienced convulsions at all times, was in a stupor unresponsive to wakefulness, did not cry or nurse, did not respond to calling or moxibustion, did not react to inhaling substances, and was unable to take medicine. I said: &quot;This is true convulsion; it cannot be treated.&quot; In our county, the magistrate Wu Zisheng, after four months, had a child with shock caused by convulsions, who was left in a stupor and unable to nurse. He would become aware when convulsing, with his eyes deviating, and his right hand twitching. He consulted me. I said: &quot;This is true convulsion; it cannot be treated.&quot; I took my leave.<a id="trans-382p" href="#orig-382p" class="marker">[382p]</a><br>A child had convulsions and phlegm blockage, and a doctor used white pills to treat it without success. After three doses, the child&#39;s condition worsened; the child lay with closed eyes, in a deep sleep, neither crying nor breastfeeding, with a wheezing sound in the throat, gasping for breath, and laxative stools. I said: &quot;The organs are failing; the condition is incurable. The excessive treatment has backfired.&quot; The doctor replied: &quot;The white pills are a miraculous remedy from the Qian family for phlegm.&quot; I said: &quot;To fully trust books is no better than having no books at all. The Qian family&#39;s pediatric techniques stem from the teachings of their disciples. Just as wood has moisture, humans have phlegm. In hot weather, plants exude moisture, which generates phlegm naturally—this is an evident truth. Phlegm is like water; it moves with the air and flows downward when it encounters an obstruction. It is not the nature of water to be stagnant. Forcing it can only exacerbate the issue. Now that phlegm rises with the fire, it is better to reduce the heat and let it descend, rather than damaging the stomach&#39;s vital energy. If the stomach&#39;s energy fails, the five organs will suffer as well. Therefore, when the eyes cannot open, it indicates liver failure; when the child is in a deep sleep and cannot breastfeed, it indicates spleen failure; when there is no crying, it indicates heart failure; when wheezing and phlegm are present, it indicates lung failure; and when there are issues with urination, it indicates kidney failure. Ultimately, it’s beyond healing and leads to death.</p>
<p>In the town, there was a Confucian doctor who treated ailments with remarkable remedies but was overly rigid and unaware of the need for flexibility. Once, a child had convulsions, and I thought it was a case of sudden fright, so I suggested a cooling purge, using Daochi powder and Xieqing pills. He argued that the convulsions were due to accumulated liver fire. When fire accumulates, it triggers convulsions, and he recommended a little life-preserving soup. People could not decide; they followed both approaches. My treatment resulted in safety within a day, while his led to death. Regret for not believing my words was now too late to remedy.<a id="trans-383p" href="#orig-383p" class="marker">[383p]</a><br>A child experienced convulsions. Initially, the method of pushing was used, but it only worsened the situation. I stated that the pushing technique is derived from the principles of acupuncture and massage. The classic says: &quot;Do not stab a person of great deficiency.&quot; The technique of pushing and pinching can only be applied to those who are strong and healthy. In the case of weak individuals, their energy does not circulate; pushing them can lead to sweating and ultimately harm their vital energy. The family did not believe my words. I warned them that if they did not take heed, the child would surely develop epilepsy. Two weeks later, he sadly passed away.</p>
<p>In the second month of the gui-hai year, a child of a certain Wu from Ying County experienced convulsions. Local doctors treated him with Erchen Decoction, ginger juice, and bamboo juice, but there was no improvement. Wu, who had just assumed his position, knew me from a previous encounter, so he sent someone to call me. Upon my arrival, I observed the child: his three places of vital energy were bluish, his cheeks were red, and his eyes had a fixed gaze; his fingers were curled as if in a fire. I concluded that his condition was caused by an external factor that had yet to be released, with heat embedded inside. A physician named Qian observed that heat in the liver causes fixed gaze; heat in the heart leads to convulsions. He also said that red cheeks coupled with a fixed gaze indicated impending wind-styled fits. The child’s liver was constantly in excess, and combined with the time of wood dominance, we needed to purge the liver. The ingredients of Erchen Decoction—aged tangerine peel, pinellia, and ginger—are all items that support the liver. The classics say: &quot;Supplement with acrid,&quot; hence the inefficacy. I then prescribed Qingxie Pills to purge the excess from the liver wood, and Daohong Powder to clear the fire from the heart. After just one dose, the convulsions stopped. </p>
<p>Noticing his innate constitution was weak and his spleen and stomach were also frail, I feared he would later develop convulsions and finally become epileptic. So, I prepared Amber Pills for him to take regularly, which calmed him.<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a><br>In Qishui, on the sandy slope, Xu Shudao&#39;s child was afflicted by convulsions. He first consulted a physician of the Zhang surname, but after several days, there was no improvement. He requested my help; the child was in severe distress with phlegm and wheezing, and frequent convulsions. I first treated the phlegm, then addressed the convulsions, gradually stabilizing the situation. However, the child still had a strong fever. The Zhang physician wanted to use a detoxifying decoction, a bamboo leaf decoction, and a minor Bupleurum decoction, all of which I opposed, saying: &quot;A child&#39;s liver is often excessive, while the spleen is usually deficient. The illness arises from the liver, where wind and wood are essentially vigorous, and the spleen and earth are injured. This is indeed false heat; do not use cold and cool treatments, as they will harm the central qi.&quot; Thus, I prescribed the Four Gunners Decoction, adding roasted astragalus and fried black ginger; after one dose, the child was at peace.<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a><br>A five-year-old child, startled from a dream, cried out in fear while holding onto his mother. This was due to being frightened. I prepared a remedy using equal parts of ginseng, Ophiopogon, Poria, Coptis, sour jujube seed, biota seed, roasted licorice, and realgar. I brewed half in water and mixed the other half with prepared Rehmannia, ground with roasted licorice into a powder, then made pills the size of millet grains. Each dose consisted of twenty-five pills taken with a broth made from lampwick, and before the full dose was finished, he was calm.</p>
<p>When I first practiced medicine, I treated a two-year-old boy who experienced convulsions and died. However, his complexion had not changed, and his hands and feet were still warm. He was not truly dead but suffered from a trapped qi and phlegm obstruction, leading to suffocation. I took mugwort and made small moxibustion sticks, applying them to the Zhongchong acupoints of both hands. When the fire reached the flesh, the boy woke up with a loud cry. I then used a family herbal remedy for fright, giving him fifteen pills of realgar detoxifying pills to expel phlegm and twenty-five pills of cooling fright pills to reduce heat. I combined these and administered them with a peppermint decoction. Shortly thereafter, he expelled yellow phlegm, and the convulsions stopped.</p>
<p>A one-year-old had a fever accompanied by convulsions. After administering Qingpian pills without effect, I inquired about the nature of his convulsions. His mother replied, &quot;After the convulsion, he only wants to sleep, and when he wakes, he plays and makes cat sounds, laughing when he sees others.&quot; I said, &quot;A physician must distinguish signs, and medicines must match those signs.&quot; I gave him Daochi Powder, and after one dose, he was calm. His father asked why this was so. I explained, &quot;The heart is associated with fire, and its sound is laughter. Fire is generated in the Yin hour, associated with the tiger, and the cat is a related creature. Therefore, making cat sounds and laughing indicates it is not a liver issue but rather a heart condition. Hence, I used Daochi Powder to drain the heart&#39;s fire and restore calm.&quot;<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a><br>A child experienced convulsions, and as a result of the method of pushing, there was a temporary retreat. A month later, on schedule, the convulsions recurred. Sometimes it would happen once a month, or even twice in a month. I said: the illness has developed into epilepsy. The method of pushing is meant to express the intention to release; phlegm accumulates in the heart and cannot be expelled. Fortunately, if epilepsy is caught early, it can still be treated; if it lingers, it will become a lifelong affliction that is incurable. Therefore, I prescribed a formula using five qian of huanglian, two and a half qian of zhushā, three fen of fèibái gānsuì, and one qian of dǎnxīng, ground into powder. Mix with glutinous rice paste and pig heart blood, then form into pills the size of qian seeds. Take one pill each time, decocted in a soup of lampwick, taking three at night and one during the day; thus, it was resolved.</p>
<p>Wang Lun in &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot; states: A three-year-old child experienced convulsions due to fright, accompanied by fever and excessive phlegm. Long-term use of medicines like Baolong Pill to clear phlegm instead caused the child’s complexion to turn either red or blue. I reasoned that initially this was due to the liver being obstructed by excess邪, hence the suitable use of the former medicine. Now, the complexion being blue and red indicates a deficiency heat of the liver meridian, which is insufficiently affecting the heart. I first used Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, supplemented with Liu Junzi Tang with a slight addition of Chaihu and Shengma to regulate and support the spleen and stomach, leading to a swift resolution of symptoms and complete recovery.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a><br>A girl from the Xi family, six years old, suddenly experienced fright, her eyes moving and teeth grinding. Sometimes she would have seizures in her sleep, with an abundance of phlegm and saliva. Various medications to dissipate phlegm and expel wind had little effect. I said: Her face is pale, and the symptoms she shows indicate that the liver&#39;s wood is overpowering the spleen&#39;s earth, which cannot control the salivation and causes it to rise. Therefore, nourishing the kidney&#39;s water and generating the liver&#39;s blood will cause the wind to cease and the phlegm to dissipate. I then used the Six-Flavor Pill and she recovered.</p>
<p>A young boy suffered from similar symptoms, with phlegm and saliva flowing freely. The use of medications for fright worsened his condition, and his spleen and stomach became weaker. Examining his complexion, he appeared pale and yellow, with saliva in his mouth. I treated him with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another boy had twitching eyes and spasms in his hands and feet. After taking Tianma Fangfeng Wan and similar medications to expel wind and transform phlegm, his previous symptoms did not improve, and the phlegm worsened. He was able to eat, and gradually his symptoms improved. Upon examining his nose and the color of his left cheek, which was blue and yellow, I said: The spleen governs saliva; this condition is due to the liver&#39;s wood overpowering the spleen&#39;s earth, which cannot manage the saliva; it is not merely phlegm accumulation. I then used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Shengma, Chaihu, and Diaoteng in two doses. His intake of food gradually increased, and all symptoms improved. I also used the Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to stabilize him.</p>
<p>A candidate, while being treated for food-induced scarlet fever, experienced spasms in his hands and feet after taking exterior-releasing medication. He took Baolong Wan and had twitching eyes and shortness of breath with excessive phlegm. I said: This is due to spleen and stomach deficiency leading to sluggish fright; there is no wind to expel and no phlegm to dispel; it is a manifestation of deficiency. I then used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with an added dose of Fuzi, and he became stable. After another dose, he recovered.<a id="trans-388p" href="#orig-388p" class="marker">[388p]</a><br>A young child, after falling ill, would experience a surge of phlegm upon being startled, grinding his teeth and having convulsions, shaking his head as if having diarrhea. After taking ingredients like brain, musk, and vermilion, he developed chronic fright and eventually passed away.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child suffered from a sudden fright, was about to recover, but then developed a fever and restlessness. Some used remedies to dispel wind and transform phlegm, which intensified the fright and convulsions, leading to phlegm cough, abdominal bloating, reduced appetite, and aversion to cold. Others used Baolong pills, which resulted in stools resembling dysentery, alternating chills and fever, resembling a wind syndrome. The late emperor examined him and believed it was due to spleen deficiency, rendering the channels unable to nourish. He prescribed Four Gentlemen Decoction, with a little Shengma and Chaihu to boost Yang qi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>The son of Da Yin Liu Yingchang suffered from scrofula and consistently took phlegm-transforming remedies, resulting in a virtual presentation that resembled convulsions. He also took the Treasure Pill for dispelling wind, experiencing frequent urination, limb convulsions, sometimes with eyes rolling, grinding his teeth and yawning, or feeling nauseous with poor appetite and stools falling into diarrhea. This indicated that the earth was injured and wood was overpowering. He was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and was cured.</p>
<p>In winter, Zhu Xiaoxi’s son had a tubercle in the neck, with a pale yellow complexion, emaciation, grinding teeth, convulsions, shaking his head and rolling his eyes. This reflected the liver wood overacting on the spleen earth, and he was treated with Liu Junzi Decoction and Jiu Wei Lu Hui Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>The grandson of Xianmu Gu Feizhai, Zhou Er, had a tubercle in the neck, arms stretched backward, and sought medicine for removing toxins. I thought that his symptoms were due to wind-heat damaging the liver, causing dryness of blood and spasms of tendons, and did not prescribe any medicine. The next morning, upon request for treatment, it turned out to be the previous diagnosis, so I gave him Liu Wei Wan in one dose, administered early in the morning, and by the afternoon, he was back to normal.<a id="trans-389p" href="#orig-389p" class="marker">[389p]</a><br>The Confucian scholar Wang Wenyuan&#39;s child suffered from tuberculosis with excessive phlegm and convulsions. After taking a formula with gold and stone to dry the phlegm, the child&#39;s hands and feet became rigid. This was due to a renewal of liver blood injury leading to acute convulsions. He then used an enhanced version of Xiaochaihu Decoction, adding Diaolenteng, Shanzhi, Xiong, and Gui to the mixture, and also used a formula combining Liuwei Dihuang Wan with Wuwei, preparing it with Mai Dong for safety.</p>
<p>The &quot;Baoyin Jinjing Lu&quot; states: A child with fever and seizures, or with limbs trembling and the left cheek red, indicates a clash of wind-heat in the heart and liver channels. First, use Chaihu Qinggan San to clear the heat from the heart and liver, followed by Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the blood of the liver and kidneys, resulting in immediate tranquility.</p>
<p>When a child seized and cried out, with cold hands and feet and a blue-black left cheek, it indicated weakness of the liver and spleen, with kidney water counteracting the spleen earth. Liu Junzi Tang was used with ginger and cinnamon, followed by a formula of Si Junzi with Xiong and Gui, and they recovered.</p>
<p>A child experiencing tidal fever and convulsions—phlegm and saliva rising, with cold hands and feet, and a blue cheek until dusk, the hand and foot tensing at times—this indicated a weakness in the liver channel, with the lung metal being overpowering, causing tidal convulsions, and the spleen earth being weak, hence the coldness in hands and feet. Use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to adjust and tonify the spleen and lungs, along with Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys for recovery. Given that excess pathogenic qi was present, one should recognize the deficiency of the original qi; using formulas to purge liver heat and transform phlegm would lead to missteps.<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a><br>A young child had a dark blue-black mark on the forehead and cried out at night in convulsions. I believed it was due to a deficiency of spleen and dampness, and recommended a decoction of Uncaria to calm him. Later, as the convulsions were triggered by fright, I used the same decoction, and the previous symptoms ceased suddenly. I then used Yiqing San, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child exhibited a blue discoloration in the eyes and had convulsions, looking upward and crying incessantly. An attempt to treat him with Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan was unsuccessful; instead, he ground his teeth and experienced discomfort, involuntarily urinating. This was due to a severe deficiency of liver blood and qi. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and he was healed.</p>
<p>A different child experienced convulsions and eye rolling, attributed to wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder channels. Initially, I administered Chai Hu Qing Gan San to clear the liver, then Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys, and he was cured.</p>
<p>Another child presented with fever and thirst, using Xie Huang San, but had heavy, sinking stools and drool at the corners of the mouth while expressing a desire to expel fire. I noted that while the nose was bluish-white with little yellow, this indicated a deficiency of spleen and stomach with coldness being overpowered by liver wood. The drooling was due to the stomach not being able to control fluids. The heavy stools indicated that the spleen qi could not rise. Believing this to be a severe deficiency leading to slow spleen wind, I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang adding Dang Gui, Mu Xiang, Pao Jiang, and two doses of Uncaria, which greatly benefited. I wished to prescribe more, but I cautioned that the strength of the medication had not reached its goal. If the previous medicine did not match the symptoms, disaster would follow. I then added a slice of Fu Zi to the previous formula, and after taking it, he became calm. I subsequently removed the Fu Zi and adjusted his treatment over two more doses until he recovered.<a id="trans-391p" href="#orig-391p" class="marker">[391p]</a><br>A small child is crying out due to a seizure, their forehead dark blue-black; this is caused by wind disturbing the liver and gallbladder affecting the spleen, leading to abdominal pain. First, administer Liu Junzi Decoction with added Mu Xiang, Chai Hu, and Diaoteng, and the crying gradually lessens. Add more Dang Gui, and after two doses, the child is calm.</p>
<p>Another child is vomiting and refusing to eat, with spasms in the hands and feet, phlegm and saliva rising, cold fingers and toes, a dark forehead and blue lips. This is due to kidney water overpowering heart fire. Use Five-Flavor Formula, adding Mu Xiang and Pao Jiang for immediate relief; then remove the Pao Jiang, and after another dose, the child recovers.</p>
<p>A child is restless and anxious, thirsty and drinking cold water, with a red color on the forehead. This is caused by excess heat in the heart. Initially, administer Xiao Xie Xin Decoction to provide some relief, followed by Chai Hu and Zhi Zi Powder, which leads to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child is experiencing sleep disturbances and fright, has a fever with profuse phlegm, and the pulse feels like an outward-bowed bow. This is due to an excess of the wood element from fright, harming the spleen and causing food not to digest. First, use Tian Ma Feng Feng Pill to dispel wind and calm the fright, then apply Five-Flavor Formula to strengthen the spleen and stop spasms, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-392p" href="#orig-392p" class="marker">[392p]</a><br>A child appeared silent and lethargic, with cold limbs and signs of fright; the spasm felt like a bow drawn inward. This indicates deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, coupled with an external invasion of cold evil. First, use the Wake-up Powder to dispel the external evil and regulate the stomach qi, resulting in immediate improvement. However, as the hands and feet remained cold, also employ the Six Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the original qi, leading to stability after several days.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: when liver wind causes head shaking, numerous prescriptions do not address it. Zheng, a bureaucrat&#39;s child, suffered for seven years with head shaking and had three years of bloody stools; having taken over a hundred prescriptions, those aimed at treating head shaking were all &#39;wind&#39; medicines, while blood-stopping remedies either caused dysentery or wind in the intestines, with no effectiveness among a hundred medicines. After observing the condition and understanding the details, it was still unclear what the root of the issue was. Upon reflection, it became evident that the blood in the liver was abundant while being externally attacked by wind-heat. The liver belongs to wood, and when it is excessive, the spleen earth is overrun by wood. The spleen and lungs are interrelated, both being overcome by the liver, leading to blood seepage into stools, resulting in persistent bloody stools. Therefore, I prescribed a formula that reduces liver wind while strengthening the spleen, using one part of rhinoceros horn powder and licorice, half a tael of wild gourd root, one qian of roasted red snake skin, five taels of wind-protecting herb, one qian of twining vine, one qian of麻黄 without joints, half a tael of honey-roasted astragalus, five qian of notopterygium, and five qian of white peony, ground into powder. Make into pills with jujube meat and take with mint tea after meals, only requiring two doses to take effect. The head shaking immediately ceased, and the bloody stools resolved as well. Subsequently, the Stomach Wind Decoction was taken, and after several days, all symptoms disappeared. Shen&#39;s child also found this effective.<a id="trans-393p" href="#orig-393p" class="marker">[393p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Infant Care&quot; states: A young child had a fever with phlegm and convulsions during the Yin and Yang hours. After taking the Baolong and Xieqing pills, they improved. Later, after resting and using the same medicine again, they developed a persistent cough and wheezing, convulsions at times, and a face that was either flushed or pale, sometimes swollen, and drooling. I believe that the cough and wheezing indicate deficiency in the spleen and lungs; the convulsions indicate that wood is overpowering earth; the bluish and yellowish complexion indicates that the liver is supporting heart fire; and the swelling and drooling indicate weak spleen qi. I used Yizhizhi pills to nourish the heart spirit and Zhongyiyiqi decoction to nourish the spleen and lungs, leading to immediate recovery.<a id="trans-394p" href="#orig-394p" class="marker">[394p]</a><br>A youth named Wang Yanghu experienced a fracture of the femur. The orthopedic treatment had been completed, but upon examining his complexion, which was pale and ashen, and noting slight movement at the corners of his mouth, I diagnosed this as a case of the liver wood insulting the spleen. Both qi and blood while musculoskeletal are sustained by the spleen&#39;s earth, and only by strengthening the spleen&#39;s qi can the injured recover. I then administered over thirty doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction, Diao Teng (Uncaria), and Angelica, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>One child suffered from seizures due to heat at noon, showing signs of fatigue, a pale complexion, reluctance to eat, and excessive salivation. I concluded that this was due to a deficiency of heart fire, which could not nourish the spleen&#39;s earth. Despite this, he took cooling heart medication, which led to increased vomiting and diarrhea, and he nearly developed chronic spleen wind. I used Six Gentlemen Decoction, ginger, and cinnamon, combined with the Rehmannia pill, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a seven-year-old had seizures with persistent fever, which worsened around noon. He showed extreme fatigue and heat, but when cooled with soup, the symptoms persisted. This indicated a deficiency of heart and spleen qi. In the morning, I prescribed the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Yi Zhi Ren (Alpinia) and in the evening, I used Six Gentlemen, Angelica, and Diao Teng, leading to recovery. However, after overeating, he vomited and had diarrhea again, and treating with Bao He Pill exacerbated his symptoms of cold and heat with seizures. This was due to the spleen being injured again and insulted by the liver&#39;s wood. I then used Six Gentlemen and Chai Hu, which alleviated the cold and heat, allowing him to eat more, but he still had diarrhea around noon. Finally, I added Fu Ling (Poria), Ban Xia (Pinellia), and Diao Teng to the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he recovered.<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a><br>A young child experienced convulsions within a hundred days, with phlegm and saliva flowing uncontrollably. The use of wind-dispelling medicine greatly worsened the condition. Observing the complexion, it was yellow with a hint of white, indicating spleen deficiency that could not control the saliva. By using the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Supplementing the Middle and Nourishing Qi Decoction, the child recovered. Later, the child suffered again, accompanied by asthma. I suspected the lungs were deficient and unable to retain qi. I used the Five Flavor Different Function Powder, with the addition of Uncaria and Bupleurum, to adjust and nourish the spleen and lungs, clear liver fire, and calm the condition.</p>
<p>A young child showed similar symptoms, with a bluish-black or pale yellow complexion. Upon examining the mother, I discovered she had long-standing frustrations. I treated her with an augmented version of Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Decoction, and the child also recovered.</p>
<p>A young child experienced convulsions and nasal obstruction within a month, which was due to wind-evil harming the body. I prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Platycodon and Asarum, for both mother and child to take. Additionally, seven stems of scallions and a slice of ginger were finely pounded and placed on paper, then warmed in the hand and quickly applied to the child’s Baihui point. After a while, the nasal discharge and convulsions ceased.</p>
<p>A child less than two months old had convulsions and vomited milk, with abdominal distension and diarrhea, indicating damage to the spleen and stomach from milk. I used the Five Flavor Different Function Powder with added Rhizoma Typhonii for the mother to take, and the child took about a spoonful, subsequently recovering.</p>
<p>A young child had sudden fright, excessive phlegm, and undigested milk, which was due to the invasion of wind-evil combined with fright, harming the liver and spleen and causing qi deficiency. Initially, I used Tianma Fángfēng Wan to expel wind and calm fright, then used the Five Flavor Different Function Powder to strengthen the spleen and stop the convulsions, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had a fever with stiffness, and the limbs were rigid, with the left cheek reddened. This indicated wind-heat in both the heart and liver channels. I first used Chai Hu Qing Gan San, followed by the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills, and the child recovered.<a id="trans-396p" href="#orig-396p" class="marker">[396p]</a><br>A small child exhibited convulsions and crying, with cold hands and feet, and a dark blue left cheek.

I administered a dose of Six Gentlemen, ginger, and cinnamon to quickly alleviate the symptoms, followed by Four Gentlemen, angelica, and a liver tonifying formula, which led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another small child had a blue color in the eyes and experienced convulsions, with the gaze directed upwards and continued crying. Administering Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan increased the grinding of teeth and irritability, with involuntary urination. I believed this was due to severe deficiency of the liver and spleen, and treated it with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A small child exhibited convulsions and eye misalignment, associated with liver and gallbladder wind-heat. I first used Chai Hu Qing Gan San to clear the liver, followed by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A small child had feverish chills, with heat starting from the time of Shen and You and stopping only at Zi and Chou. The whole body seemed itchy, experiencing constipation and red, painful urination, along with a thirst for cold drinks. This indicated an excess heat in the spleen and stomach affecting the lungs and large intestine. Initially, I employed Four Cool Drinks to reduce the fever. Subsequently, I used Si Wu San with Chai Hu and Huang Lian for several doses, and the sores gradually healed. The child wanted quicker results, so I tried using similar treatments with Sophora japonica, which worsened the symptoms. Eventually, I referred the case to the hospital director for treatment, who used the same remedies but added peach kernel and red peony, and it took up to a hundred doses for recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, a small child experienced a stagnation of food and took purging medicines, resulting in a pale yellow complexion, general fatigue, decreased appetite, and feverish chills from Shen and You time. I intended to use tonic medicines, but they refused, opting instead for clearing heat and inducing diarrhea, which only aggravated the condition. I utilized several doses of Six Gentlemen, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-397p" href="#orig-397p" class="marker">[397p]</a><br>A young child, experiencing heat at the You and Xu hours with a red face and abdominal pain that worsens upon pressure, was treated with harsh purgatives, resulting in five to seven bowel movements, spasms, vomiting of phlegm, and thirst with abdominal pain. When pressed, the pain subsided. This was a case of damage to the spleen and stomach leading to symptom change. Therefore, a combination of the Seven Flavor Bai Zhu Powder and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was administered for immediate relief.</p>
<p>Another young child had food stagnation and was given digestive medicines. It was noted that this was due to spleen and stomach deficiency leading to food stagnation, necessitating a nourishing approach. Later, during the Shen, You, and Xu hours, the child experienced tidal heat, decreased appetite, and unformed stools. The Four Gentlemen Decoction was given, which allowed for improved diet, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, resolving all symptoms.</p>
<p>The child of Yao Yi experienced a reddening of the body during food stoppage due to internal food stagnation and damp-heat manifesting outward. The Qing Zhong Jie Yu Decoction was administered with success. Later, the child had issues with head shaking and teeth grinding, copious phlegm leading to spasms, with sour-tasting vomit. Care was taken to ensure all was expelled. The next day, a slight dose of the Seven Flavor Bai Zhu Powder was used to regulate the spleen and stomach, leading to no further issues.</p>
<p>Another young child stopping food intake was given a laxative, resulting in vomiting and abdominal distension, indicating further spleen and stomach damage, treated effectively with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>A young child had involuntary eye movement and limb spasms. Several doses of Tian Ma Fang Feng Pill and similar remedies failed to resolve the prior condition but did improve phlegm slightly. Upon examining the child’s pulse and noticing a greenish-yellow complexion on the left cheek, it was concluded that the spleen governs saliva, and liver wood was overpowering spleen earth, disrupting the regulation of phlegm, thus confirming excess phlegm. Subsequently, a combined treatment of Liu Jun and herbs like Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, and Diao Teng was used, allowing for gradual dietary improvement and symptom resolution; further treatment with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction provided stability.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a><br>A treatment for a young child who suffered from fever and diarrhea at the times of Hai, Zi, and Chou used the beneficial Huang powder, resulting in recovery. This condition recurred, and after taking the same medicine, the child became drowsy with open eyes, experienced thirst, had a reduced appetite, and passed yellow stools frequently. I diagnosed it as the liver being dominant and the spleen being deficient, with the vital energy sinking. I administered the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction with a supplement of Rehmannia Pills, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>For an elderly child one year old, who was exposed to sudden cold in early autumn and developed convulsions resembling epilepsy, followed by shallow breathing, it was determined that this was due to weak vital energy. The Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction was given, resulting in tranquility.</p>
<p>One child aged ten and another aged seven each had epilepsy, occurring twice a year. Later, after experiencing smallpox and suffering from food stagnation, the frequency of seizures increased. Both were treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction, resulting in relief.</p>
<p>A six-year-old child suddenly developed convulsions, with eye movements and teeth grinding, and sometimes startled and convulsed in sleep, with drooling of phlegm. Taking medications to resolve phlegm and dispel wind only exacerbated the condition, and the child’s complexion turned blue. This was attributed to liver wood restraining spleen earth, preventing retention of saliva, thus leading to upward movement of phlegm. It was necessary to nourish kidney water and create liver blood, which would allow the wind to cease and phlegm to dissipate. The Six-Flavor Pills were administered, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child suffering from epilepsy would vomit phlegm upon each episode, becoming drowsy and recovering partially. Various medications were ineffective. At the age of thirteen, the episodes increased in frequency. The treatment involved grinding placenta into powder, adding ginseng and angelica root powder, forming pills the size of walnuts. Each dose consisted of thirty to fifty pills, taken three to five times a day. Over a month, the child gradually improved, and the Eight Treasures Decoction was also used to achieve full recovery.<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a><br>A young boy, aged seven, suffered from convulsions. Initially, he was allowed to drink human milk for his condition, which became less severe over time. At fourteen, he had another episode and continued to use human milk. When that didn’t work, I instructed the use of processed purple river caterpillar mixed with human milk until it formed a paste. He took it two to three times a day, and after several days, he recovered. He later regularly took modified Eight Valuable Herbs Pills and stabilized thereafter. </p>
<p>At twenty-three, he had another episode with coldness in his hands and feet, so I returned to the previous method, supplemented with Eight Valuable Herbs Pills and Shiquan Dabu Decoction, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another boy, aged thirteen, had convulsions and was cured after taking a red mercury pill. However, whenever he had another episode, he took the previous pills without success. I thought it was due to the heart and spleen channels being deficient in qi and blood, leading to phlegm accumulation. In the morning, I used a invigorating decoction; in the evening, I gave a calming pill, and he gradually improved. After recovering from chickenpox, his convulsions returned, so I again used the invigorating decoction as the main treatment, combined with Eight Treasures Decoction and chrysalis and vine drink, and he was cured.</p>
<p>A young child caught a cold, had a stuffy nose and runny eyes, and after taking overly strong medicine, developed convulsions along with yawning and restlessness, with sweating and shortness of breath, persisting for a long time without improvement. His mother, due to labor, developed a fever. I used the invigorating decoction, giving him five to seven drops to drink each time, and both mother and son recovered.<a id="trans-400p" href="#orig-400p" class="marker">[400p]</a><br>A young child with a cold developed spasms, excessive phlegm, and a severe cough. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of spleen and lung qi, with the external pathogenic influence taking advantage of it. I prescribed a formula combining Six Gentlemen with Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, Sang Pi, and Xing Ren, which relieved the phlegm and wheezing. After one dose, I removed the Sang Pi and Xing Ren and added Zhao Teng Gou for stabilization, then used Yi Gong San. After several doses, the symptoms did not recur. If the spleen and stomach are not strengthened, and the exterior defense is not secured, but treatment focuses solely on phlegm, there are rarely good outcomes.</p>
<p>A different child experienced food stagnation, vomiting, and diarrhea, and subsequently started clenching teeth with spasms, a pale blue complexion, and cold hands and feet with twitching of the brows and lips. I believed this to be due to a weak spleen and stomach, worsened by the medicine, with the liver wood overpowering it, leading to chronic convulsions. I thus used Six Gentlemen adding Mu Xiang, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma in two doses to stabilize the situation. Generally, in cases of food stagnation, even with spasms and similar symptoms, one should avoid medication and allow the accumulated food to digest completely; as gastric energy strengthens, self-recovery occurs. If one insists on forcing food or misuses herbs, it not only worsens existing issues but also creates new ones.</p>
<p>A scholar&#39;s son, Du Kehong, had a fever with convulsions and a stiff mouth with phlegm surging; this indicated fullness-fire in the liver and gallbladder meridians, an urgent case of sudden convulsions. I first used Xie Qing Wan, followed by two doses of Liu Wei Wan, which caused immediate improvement in symptoms. I then administered Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Chuan Xiong, Gui, Shan Zhi, and Zhao Teng Gou for stabilization, and finally used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for recovery.<a id="trans-401p" href="#orig-401p" class="marker">[401p]</a><br>A young child was tormented by fever, startled fits, and unable to nurse, with a pulse resembling tangled fish bones. This indicated a sudden attack of wind-heat. I first administered a small dose of Baolong Pill to dispel wind and transform phlegm, followed by Liu Junzi Decoction with Chaihu to strengthen the spleen and soothe the liver, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, during the hot months, experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with slight movements of the eyes and lips, a pale blue complexion, and cold hands and feet. I utilized Yulu Powder; I suspected it had developed into slow spleen wind and recommended warming and supplementing the spleen and stomach. They did not believe me, and subsequently, the child died.</p>
<p>A child with tongue playing and fits, whose fingers were not cold, led me to believe there was deficiency-heat in the liver and spleen. I prescribed Yigong Powder with Shengma and Chaihu, leading to recovery. Later, due to abdominal distension from nursing injuries, I administered medications to counteract stagnation, resulting in diarrhea and tongue playing with fits. I examined the mother’s liver fire and treated them both with Xiao Chaihu Decoction plus Shengma and Baizhu, resulting in both recovering.</p>
<p>One child, overindulging in milk and food, suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. I used a large dose of Yigong Powder combined with Chaihu and Shengma, and both mother and child recovered. Later, due to fright, they took medicinal substances similar to Zhibao Pill, which caused tongue playing and fits nearly leading to slow fright. I employed Liu Junzi Decoction with Bai Fuzheng and they recovered.</p>
<p>Another child showed tongue protrusion, fever, and an aversion to cold drinks, with yellow-red forehead and nose, and excessive salivation. I diagnosed it as excess heat in the heart and spleen and prescribed Daohong and Xiehuang powders for recovery. After a relapse, they took other heat-clearing medicines but continued with tongue playing. I then used Yigong Powder with Diaoteng and brought them to stability; I also administered Liu Junzi Decoction for total recovery.<a id="trans-402p" href="#orig-402p" class="marker">[402p]</a><br>A young child, while sleeping at night, suddenly became startled and convulsed, with a foul-smelling and dark-colored stool. This indicates a spleen injury and excessive liver energy. Initially, a modified Yigong powder with Chaihu, Shengma, and Shanzhizi was used, followed by a remedy of four medicinals for children, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, sporadically startled from sleep and convulsing, experienced thirst and drank cold water, with a bluish left cheek and a red forehead. First, a Chaihu Liver Clearing powder combined with four doses of Diaoteng hook was used to treat liver fire, followed by Wuwei Yigong powder to strengthen the spleen, and Dihuang pills to nourish the kidney and liver for calming.</p>
<p>A nine-year-old child developed a fever due to fright, resulting in convulsions and a feeling of heaviness. The child ground their teeth out of thirst for cold drinks and experienced constipation, with a face showing both bluish and red hues, and a notably red area on the left cheek. This is a sign of the heart and liver channels being affected by wind-heat, indicating a condition of substantial illness. Initially, a Xieqing pill and a prepared Huanglian were used, resulting in prompt bowel movement and significant reduction of heat-related convulsions. Subsequently, a Yiqing pill was administered, causing all symptoms to recede. However, the child&#39;s complexion remained pale and sallow, with limb fatigue and decreased appetite; this indicated that the pathogenic qi had departed but the spleen&#39;s energy had not yet recovered. Thus, a tonic of Buzhong Yiqi decoction and Dihuang pills were used for full recovery.</p>
<p>Another child experienced fever and convulsions, with a closed mouth and phlegm flowing; this was caused by excess fire in the gallbladder channel leading to convulsions from fright. Initially, a Xieqing pill was given, followed by two doses of Liuli pills, and the symptoms immediately subsided. Then, a small dose of Chaihu soup combined with Qianghuo, Angelica, Shanzhizi, and Diaoteng hook was used, followed by Buzhong Yiqi decoction, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-403p" href="#orig-403p" class="marker">[403p]</a><br>A small child suddenly developed a fever, with trembling and clenching teeth, accompanied by a profusion of phlegm. Administration of medications for expelling wind and transforming phlegm worsened the condition. The child&#39;s complexion was bluish-yellow, indicating that the liver (wood element) was damaging the spleen (earth element). The spleen&#39;s fluid is saliva; when deficient, it cannot contain, causing it to rise and resemble phlegm. The treatment should focus on nourishing the liver and strengthening the spleen, leading to relief from wind and healing of phlegm. Therefore, six flavor pill and six gentlemen decoction were administered, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old girl, prone to anger, experienced sudden fright during sleep, with whole-body itching and diminished appetite. This was due to liver fire and wind-heat disturbing the spleen. A decoction of ginseng, wormwood, and zizyphus was used to clear liver fire, cool the liver blood, and strengthen the spleen and stomach, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child suffered from sudden convulsions, presenting with a flushed face, fever, and thirst for cold drinks. The previous physician had administered a dose of the blue-purge pill, which reduced the fever significantly. However, the following morning, the child took another dose and immediately experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions, with a bluish-white complexion and cold extremities. I surmised the fever had been alleviated but inappropriate administration further harmed the spleen and stomach. Thus, I prescribed the six gentlemen decoction with ginger, cinnamon, bulbus elevatae, and bupleurum, providing immediate relief. The ancients noted that children easily shift between deficiency and excess; thus, using harsh purgatives can abruptly stop the illness. This principle was followed by my previous mentor.</p>
<p>A small child experienced tidal fever with convulsions, rising phlegm, and cold extremities, with a bluish tint and hidden whiteness on the left cheek at the shen and you times. This indicated deficiency in the heart and liver meridians. The secret-anxiety calming pill and four-herb decoction, along with radix ledebouriella and sour jujube seeds, were administered, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another small child presented with tidal fever and convulsions, with phlegm rising, cold extremities, and a bluish color with hidden white on the left cheek during the evening. A decoction for tonifying and invigorating qi was used to bolster the spleen and lungs. The six flavor pill nourished the liver and kidneys, leading to healing.<a id="trans-404p" href="#orig-404p" class="marker">[404p]</a><br>A young girl from Jiaxing, aged seven, suffered a leg injury from a fall, resulting in swelling and ulceration of her knees, alongside a bluish color on her left cheek and absence of the left wrist pulse. Her fright caused her Qi to disperse, while wind-heat became stagnant in her liver, hence the hidden pulse. I first administered a dose of the Four Gentlemen decoction with added Shengma, Chaihu, and Diaoteng, which stabilized her pulse. Then I used the Four Substances decoction with Chaihu, Fangfeng, and Diaoteng to nourish blood and liver, and she recovered.</p>
<p>A young boy experienced convulsions followed by persistent phlegmy cough and restless sleep with no effect from various medicines. I gave him a small dose of Niuhuang Qingxin Wan, which stopped the symptoms; later, he caught a cold, resulting in phlegm accumulation and urgent wheezing, troubled by inability to eat. I again used a small dose of Niuhuang Wan to calm him; subsequently, I administered Yigong San with added Jiegeng, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another boy exhibited convulsions with drooling phlegm; using the medication for convulsions exacerbated his condition. Observing his pale yellow complexion, I applied the Six Gentlemen decoction and the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction to tonify his spleen and lung, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A child suffering from a cold presented a cough with phlegm. I suspected a deficiency in the spleen and weakness in the lungs, contributing to an invulnerability to external wind. I treated him with the Six Gentlemen decoction, Jiegeng, Sangpi, and Xingren, which resulted in recovery. Later, he faced food stagnation and abdominal distention, leading me to add Hawthorn and Houpu to the Six Gentlemen formula for relief. However, he encountered vomiting with stagnant food; administering medication exacerbated his cough. I determined that both his spleen and lungs were deficient, thus a restorative approach was required. He thought it would suffice to use medicines for dispersal, but his previous symptoms worsened, causing his head to shake. I then prescribed a potent Tian Nanshen powder, significantly increasing Diaoteng and combining it with Yigong San, which ultimately brought about his recovery.<a id="trans-405p" href="#orig-405p" class="marker">[405p]</a><br>A young child has a crooked mouth and eyes, with a face that is sometimes blue and sometimes red; this indicates that the wind-fire of the liver and heart is attacking the spleen. In the morning, a formula called Chaihu Qinggan San is used, and in the evening, a modified Yigong San with added Diaoteng is given, resulting in recovery. At that time, the child had previous symptoms and those who took drugs to dispel wind and guide phlegm could not improve.</p>
<p>Another young child, after suffering from dysentery, exhibited spasm of the anterior symptoms, a withered yellow complexion, and lethargic limbs; this indicated a deficiency of vital energy due to excessive depletion. I used a modified Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with added Diaoteng, and after taking it, the child gradually recovered. Later, due to the wet nurse&#39;s inappropriate emotional state and diet, or perhaps the child overfed, the previous symptoms returned, but it resolved after taking Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Wuwei Yigong San.</p>
<p>Another child, startled by the wet nurse, began to have spasms, presenting with red eyes, a strong fever, abdominal pain, crying and bending forward. I administered Sihua combined with Chaihu and Fangfeng, and then used a modified Xiaoyao San with cooked Dihuang to clear the liver heat. Blood from the liver was generated, and I further used Dihuang Wan to nourish the kidney water to engender the liver wood, resulting in safety for both mother and child.</p>
<p>Another young child cried while bending forward, presenting with a blue face and black lips; this was due to cold air affecting the body, causing internal abdominal pain. I gave a dose of Wuwei Yigong San with added Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, and this was taken by the mother as well, resulting in immediate recovery. Later, due to the mother catching a cold and experiencing abdominal pain while crying, I administered a dose of Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang to the mother, which also calmed down the child.<a id="trans-406p" href="#orig-406p" class="marker">[406p]</a><br>A young child has a high-pitched cry, cold hands and feet. After taking a mixture of Six Gentlemen Decoction with dried ginger and patchouli with no effect, adding cinnamon led to both mother and child feeling at ease.</p>
<p>A young child suddenly cries dryly and has diarrhea, experiencing convulsions while asleep, with cold hands and feet. This indicates a deficiency and cold in the spleen, with the liver&#39;s wood insulting it, causing convulsions. A dose of Yiyang Powder was given, followed by Four Gentlemen Decoction with above-mentioned remedies, gradually allowing proper food intake, resulting in stability.</p>
<p>A young child cries dryly, with a blue or red face and warm hands and feet; even after taking heat-clearing medicines for a long time, there&#39;s no improvement. It’s diagnosed that the lactating mother has stagnant liver fire. Treating the mother with a modified Xiao Yao San and Yue Ju Wan, and giving the child a few drops, both mother and child recover within days.</p>
<p>A young child presented with the earlier symptoms improved after taking Wei Xiang San. However, later symptoms persisted including coughing and wheezing. This signifies deficiency and cold of primal energy. I first used Wu Xie Four Gentlemen Decoction, which slightly improved the condition; however, fatigue was severe, so I utilized Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Five Flavor Yi Gong Powder that led to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child fell ill after the mother frequently drank hot liquor due to cold abdominal pain, showing symptoms such as fever, excessive phlegm, flushed face, and warm hands and feet. This indicated excess heat in the stomach channel; after administering Qing Wei Powder to both mother and child, they both recovered. Later, due to a breast injury resulting in vomiting and diarrhea, the child displayed a pale or white face, cold hands and feet, indicating a deficiency and cold in spleen qi. Administration of Six Gentlemen, patchouli, and dried ginger led to recovery. After three years, due to food injury causing abdominal pain, dark lips, and diarrhea with little to no stools, or dark stools, indicating deficiency and cold of primal energy lowering, treatment with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction led to gradual improvement.<a id="trans-407p" href="#orig-407p" class="marker">[407p]</a><br>A young child cried out, with a swollen scrotum, rolling eyes, and red tears flowing from the eyes. This indicated internal liver heat. I treated it with Chaihu Qinggan San, adding materials to clear heat, and the symptoms gradually improved. I also used Diao Teng Yin, and he recovered completely. When it recurred, I used a remedy to eliminate the root of the illness, which resulted in a decrease in milk intake, abdominal distension and pain, and swelling in the hands and feet. I first applied Liu Jun Zi Tang, along with several doses of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, and the symptoms slightly improved. There were also cases of vomiting and diarrhea due to harm from milk and food, and a single dose of Ping Wei San cured it.</p>
<p>Another child experienced abdominal pain and convulsions due to the emotional distress of being held by the wet nurse; it had not improved for a long time. I used Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang with Liu Lu, and both mother and child took the medicine, gradually improving. After that, the mother became very angry and had a fainting spell, causing the child to resume nursing. However, this led to abdominal pain, diarrhea, a greenish face, and vomiting. I first administered Xiao Chai Hu Tang in two doses for both mother and child, with slight improvement. The mother later experienced acid reflux and abdominal distension, and I used Yue Ju Wan along with Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang, complemented by Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>One young child caught a cold, developing a fever, cough, and clenched teeth. I suspected a deficiency in spleen and lung Qi, but others were skeptical, so I used a dispersing medicine. Ultimately, there was neck stiffness and inability to open the mouth, with continuous sweating and cold hands and feet. I then employed Wu Wei Yi Gong San, adding Chai Hu and Mu Xiang, and he was ashamed to recover. However, he had slight heat in the late afternoon, and upon waking with his eyes open, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to complete recovery.<a id="trans-408p" href="#orig-408p" class="marker">[408p]</a><br>A young child suffered from a sudden fever due to fright, mistakenly treated with exterior dispersing methods, resulting in sweating and a pale face. By afternoon, he developed convulsions. My elder brother believed it to be due to deficiency of the spleen and lungs, with excess of liver and gallbladder. He treated it with a modification of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. The convulsion occurred during the Yin and Mao hours, indicating the liver&#39;s excess. After administering a dose of the modified Xiao Yao San, the fever quickly subsided; then, he used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child had a scrofula that ruptured, causing convulsions, irritability, teeth grinding, and alternating chills and fever. This was attributed to liver wind-heat. Initially, a dose of Chai Hu Zhi Zi San was given, which promptly halted the chills and fever. Subsequently, he used Si Wu Tang, Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Bai Zhu, and Chai Hu, which gradually alleviated the symptoms. He then administered the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding Shao Yao and Fu Ling, resulting in complete recovery.</p>
<p>A child with a scalp wound that had ruptured developed convulsions, accompanied by either chills and fever or cold hands and feet. The pulse was large and floating but weak upon palpation, indicating deficiency of original qi and excess of pathogenic qi. He prescribed several doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, leading to gradual improvement in symptoms and a more restrained pulse. After over ten doses, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A young child experienced convulsions due to fright, after taking Bao Long Wan and Bao Sheng Ding, he had excessive saliva, sweating, and convulsions, and still wanted to expel phlegm. I stated that this was due to deficiency of liver and spleen blood, leading to internal wind. The persistent phlegm retention was due to spleen and lung qi deficiency, unable to control saliva. The sweating and convulsions indicated a loss of yang due to spleen and lung qi deficiency. He used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Pao Jiang and Mu Xiang, which resulted in immediate recovery; he then applied Si Jun Zi Tang with Gui Zhi and Huang Qi for stabilization.<a id="trans-409p" href="#orig-409p" class="marker">[409p]</a><br>A young child suffered from a cold and fever, took herbal medicine for relief, and perspired incessantly. The symptoms of vexation were fully present, with a pulse that was large and rapid, but felt thin upon pressure. This excessive sweating indicated a loss of yang, along with a deficiency of spleen and lung qi. I prescribed Yigong San with added Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Astragalus, which promptly stopped the sweating. Then I administered the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child, having stopped eating, was experiencing abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, and after taking a harsh remedy, continued to vomit and diarrhea, sweating profusely, with cold hands and feet, and unceasing spasms. The pulse was floating and rapid, but felt like silk upon pressing. I used Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Sheng Ma and roasted Ginger, which halted the spasms immediately. However, as the child continued to have alternating chills and fevers, I prescribed Si Jun Zi Tang, along with Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, and they recovered.</p>
<p>A girl, the granddaughter of Shao Can Wang Yanghu, aged eight, experienced spasms. After taking a remedy to reduce heat and relieve stagnation, her pulse was floating and rapid, with chills and fever resembling malaria. I further applied Si Jun Zi Tang with added Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, roasted Ginger, and Gunteng. Gradually, she began to recover; however, she experienced pain beneath her ribs, so I replaced roasted Ginger with Mu Xiang and Cinnamon, which led to her complete recovery.</p>
<p>A young child fell ill due to the great anger of her wet nurse, experiencing fever and pain beneath the ribs, suffering from the aforementioned symptoms, along with sweating and vomiting. Initially, I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang, and both mother and child took it, leading to an immediate recovery. However, in the afternoon, the child experienced tidal fever, so I treated it with Yigong San, adding Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>One child was ill due to the wet nurse’s fever and vomiting, while another had fallen into a stupor after the nurse ate something harmful. Each child was treated by addressing their mother, and they both fully recovered.<a id="trans-410p" href="#orig-410p" class="marker">[410p]</a><br>A young child suddenly arched their back, looking up with a face that was both blue and red. The blue indicates liver wind, while the red is fire from the heart. The combination of wind and fire requires the use of Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder, with an added dose of Diaoteng to calm the situation; if phlegm persists, then Baolong pills are to be used for recovery.</p>
<p>Another child unexpectedly arched their back after taking medicine for fright, later frequently experiencing seizures, with a pale yellow and white complexion, and extreme fatigue in limbs. I used Wuwu Yi Gong powder in over ten doses for recovery. Later, due to fright combined with improper diet, they periodically seized again. Using the previous medicine brought about recovery. I then administered powdered Ren and Atractylodes in doses of five to seven fen, boiled with ginger and jujubes, maintaining this until two liang without seizures. In these two cases, the original energy was deficient while the pathogenic energy was substantial; employing harsh medicines against the evil would be a mistake.</p>
<p>A child who had long suffered from the previous condition had a strong phlegm presence, with a complexion pale yet occasional bluish tint. I concluded that the lung qi could not balance the liver, the liver qi was overwhelming the spleen, and the spleen was deficient leading to phlegm. First, I administered Baolong pills twice to calm the liver, followed by Liu Jun Zi decoction to tonify the spleen and lungs, leading to recovery in over a month. Half a year later, the case relapsed, leading me to believe that the phlegm must be purged for full recovery. Consequently, I administered laxatives; phlegm and saliva were profuse, producing a sawing sound in the throat. I stated: the spleen cannot control the saliva. The noise in the throat indicates severe lung qi deficiency. Thus, I used five qian of ginseng and three fen of ginger, decocted in water, allowing them to awaken. After the fourth dose, I added two jujubes and used several liang of ginseng for recovery. In subsequent episodes, only ginseng soup was effective. Adhering strictly to the usual treatments would often result in mistakes.<a id="trans-411p" href="#orig-411p" class="marker">[411p]</a><br>Wang Kentang in &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: In the Eastern Capital, the son of the Wang family experienced diarrhea. Various doctors treated him with purgatives until he became weak, showing symptoms of a lingering fright, such as drowsiness with exposed eyes, coldness in his limbs, and shivering. Qian noted that this was a lingering fright and prescribed Guo Luo Decoction. If the son had strong stomach qi, he would regain consciousness and warmth. Wang doubted that his son had no bowel movements and ordered the doctors to use medications to induce them. The doctors administered Ba Zheng Powder several times, but it was ineffective and his body became cold again. Wang then instructed Qian to help with urination, but Qian advised against it, saying: &quot;Inducing urination would lead to coldness in the body.&quot; After one or two days, the body did indeed become cold. They then carried him out, and Qian remarked: &quot;He cannot eat and has a weak stomach. If we induce bowel movements, both the spleen and stomach will be exhausted, leading to body coldness and closing of the eyes, which could be fatal. Fortunately, the fetal energy is strong and resilient.&quot; Qian used Yi Huang Powder and Shi Jun Zi Pills for four doses, allowing him to drink and eat a little by noon. The reasoning behind this was that inducing bowel movements while the spleen and stomach were weak and cold could lead to further problems; therefore, the spleen should be strengthened rather than attacked separately. Later, he also became mute, and the doctors attempted to treat his lost voice. Qian suggested that since he was mute, how could he open his eyes and eat? Moreover, his teeth were not tightly closed and his mouth was not locked. The doctors were baffled and recommended using Rehmannia to nourish the kidneys. Qian countered that this was due to cooling medications that induced urination, resulting in weakness of both the spleen and kidneys. Now that the spleen was strong but the kidneys were still weak, it was essential to nourish the kidneys gently. After half a month of treatment, he could speak, and within a month, he was healed.<a id="trans-412p" href="#orig-412p" class="marker">[412p]</a><br>In my youth, I heard my friend Sun Pengshan say: he once saw a young child from his in-laws who suffered from seizures. They sought specialized treatment, and all symptoms subsided, yet he continued to shake his head uncontrollably. Later, an older doctor arrived and added purple river car to the regular medication, and the child was instantly cured. According to the &quot;Shennong Bencao,&quot; purple river car, also known as &quot;Zao Xiu,&quot; is noted in Tang texts as &quot;Jin Xian Chong Lou,&quot; and referred to as &quot;Bai Gan Sui&quot; in the Qian family&#39;s prescriptions, mainly treating seizures, head shaking, and tongue antics. Thus, the main text of the classics indicates that ancient practitioners believed following the writings closely was highly effective, and it is not false.<a id="trans-413p" href="#orig-413p" class="marker">[413p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　帝曰：人生而有病巅疾者，病名曰何？安所得之？岐伯曰：病名为胎病。此得之在母腹中时，其母有所大惊，气上而不下，精气并居，故令子发为巅疾也。　　 【此女子胞之为病也，有所大惊，则气暴上而不下。夫精以养胎，而精气并居者也。母受惊而气上，则子之精气亦逆，故令子发为巅疾也。愚谓巅当作癫。按婴儿癫癎，多因母腹中受惊所致。然癫疾者，逆气之所生也，故因气上逆而发为癫疾。】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　　　千金方 【唐　孙思邈】</p>

<p>　　惊风之要领有二：一曰实证、一曰虚证而尽之矣。盖急惊者，阳证也，实证也，乃肝邪有余而风生热，热主痰，痰热客于心膈间，则风火相搏，故其形证急暴而痰火壮热者，是为急惊，此当先治其标，后治其本。慢惊者，阴谁也，虚证也，此脾肺俱虚，肝邪无制，因而侮脾生风，无阳之证也，故其形气病气俱不足者，是为慢惊，此当专顾脾肾以救元气。虽二者俱名惊风，而虚实之有不同，所以急慢之名亦异。凡治此者，不可不顾其名以思其义。　　小儿惊风，肝病也，亦脾肾心肺病也。盖小儿之真阴未足，柔不济刚，故肝邪易动。肝邪动则木能生火，火能生风，风热相搏则血虚，血虚则筋急，筋急则为掉眩反张、搐搦强直之类，皆肝木之本病也。<a id="orig-166p" href="#trans-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>至其相移，木邪侮土，则脾病而为痰，为吐泻；木盛金衰，则肺病而为喘促，为短气；木火上炎，则心病而为惊叫，为烦热；木火伤阴，则肾病而为水涸，为血燥，为肝渴，为汗不出，为搐为痓，此五脏惊风之大概也。治此之法，有要存焉。盖一曰风，二曰火，三曰痰，四曰阳虚，五曰阴虚，但能察此缓急，则尽之矣。所谓风者，以其强直掉眩，皆属肝木，风木同气，故云惊风而热，非外感之证，今人不明此义，但为治风必须用散，不知外来之风可散，而血燥之风不可散也。故凡如防风、荆芥、羌活、独活、细辛、干葛、柴胡、紫苏、薄荷之类，使果有外邪发热无汗等证，乃可暂用。如无外邪，则最所当忌。此用散之不可不慎也。所谓痰火者，痰凝则气闭，火盛则阴亏，此实邪之病本也。若痰因火动，则治火为先；火以痰留，则去痰为主。<a id="orig-167p" href="#trans-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>火之盛者，宜龙胆草、山栀子、黄连、黄蘗、石膏、大黄之属；火之微者，宜黄芩、知母、元参、石斛、地骨皮、木通、天麻之属。痰之甚者，宜牛黄、胆星、天竺黄、南星、半夏、白芥子之属；痰之微者，宜陈皮、前胡、海石、贝母、天花粉之属。此外如朱砂之色赤体重，故能入心镇惊；内孕水银，故善透经络，坠痰降火。雄黄之气味雄悍，故能破结开滞，直达横行。冰片、麝香乃开窍之要药。琥珀、青黛亦清利之佐助而已。又如僵蚕、全蝎、蝉蜕之属，皆云治风。在僵蚕，味咸而辛，大能开痰涎，破结气。用佐痰药，善去肝脾之邪，邪去则肝平，是即治风之谓也。全蝎生于东北，色青属木，故善走厥阴，加以盐味咸而降痰，是亦同气之属，故云治风，较之僵蚕，此其次矣。蝉蜕性味俱薄，不过取其清虚轻蜕之义，非有实济，不足恃也。凡惊风之实邪，惟痰火为最，而风则次之。<a id="orig-168p" href="#trans-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>治实之法，止于是矣。然邪实者易制，主败者必危。盖阳虚则阴邪不散，而元气不复；阴虚则营气不行，而精血何来？所以惊风之重重在虚证。不虚不重，不竭不危。此元精元气，相为并立，有不容偏置者也。故治虚之法，当辨阴阳。阳虚者宜燥宜刚，阴虚者宜温宜润。然善用阳者，气中自有水；善用阴者，水中自有气。造化相须之妙，既有不可混，又有不可离者如此。设有谓此非小儿之药，此非惊风之药者，岂惊风之病不属阴阳，而小儿之体不由血气乎？若夫人者开口便可见心，又乌足与论乾坤合一之道。　　惊风反张强直转筋等病，在经筋篇曰：足少阴之筋病，足下转筋，及所过而结者皆痛。病在此者，主癎瘈及痉。在外者不能俯，在内者不能仰。故阳病者腰反折不能俯，阴病者不能仰。又曰：经筋之病，寒则反折筋急。热则筋弛纵不收，阴痿不用。阳急则反折，阴急则俯不伸。<a id="orig-169p" href="#trans-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>　　　　　急惊风</p>

<p><strong>On Childhood Seizures</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic of Medicine)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Unusual Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: When a person is born with epilepsy, what is the name of this condition? How does one come by it? Qibo replied: It is called &quot;fetal disease.&quot; This occurs when the mother experiences a significant shock during pregnancy; her qi rises and does not descend, causing the essential energy to reside together, hence the child develops epilepsy. </p>
<p>[The illness of the female fetus results from a great shock, leading to an upward surge of qi that does not descend. Essential energy nourishes the fetus, but when this energy resides together, the mother&#39;s shock causes an upward movement of qi, thus the child&#39;s essential energy is also reversed, leading to the manifestation of seizures. It is my humble opinion that &quot;epilepsy&quot; should often be written as &quot;dizziness.&quot; It is noted that infantile epilepsy often arises from the mother experiencing shock during pregnancy. Hence, epilepsy is born from reversed qi, manifesting due to the upward reversal of qi.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Condition of Surprise Seizures</strong></p>
<p>It is said: The reason children experience surprise seizures (癎病) and cramps (痉病) is due to imbalances in the internal energies. If a newborn exhibits surprise seizures, it is because the five organs are not properly contained, the blood and energy are not gathering, the five organs are not functioning smoothly, and the bones are weak, often leading to incomplete growth. If seizures occur after the child is more than forty days old and continue until the first year, it is also due to improper nursing, disharmony in the blood and energy, or being affected by external wind pathogens. </p>
<p>Initially, if the child’s body feels hot, accompanied by sudden startles and crying, followed by pain, a floating pulse indicates a yang seizure, which affects the six bowels and the skin, and is relatively easy to treat. Conversely, if the body feels cold, with no startles or crying, and the pulse is deep when the condition manifests, it indicates a yin seizure, affecting the five organs and the inner bones, making it very difficult to treat. When the body softens and regains consciousness during an episode, it is called a seizure. If the body stiffens and arches like a bow, and does not regain consciousness, it is termed a cramp.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of severe convulsions, if an adult&#39;s back can accommodate a sideways hand, and a child&#39;s arm can fit three fingers, it is no longer treatable. The distinction between superficial and deep pulse reflects whether the illness lies in Yin or Yang. Superficial and deep pulses can further exhibit variations such as large, slippery, thin, firm, sluggish, or rapid, each requiring treatment based on the pulse&#39;s characteristics. The &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot; states that childhood convulsions have one hundred twenty types, with symptoms subtly differing from the norm; these are indicative of convulsions. When a child first emerges, their blood vessels are not yet consolidated, and their internal organs are not yet fully developed; if nurturing is not appropriately managed, illness will ensue. If unfortified, diseases may arise from changes and steaming. Other symptoms may be mild, but middle wind (stroke) is the most sudden and dangerous. If a child&#39;s limbs are prone to spasms and their breathing is slightly different, and they show signs of a convulsion and experience steaming with no resolution, Longdan decoction should be administered. There are three types of convulsions in children: wind convulsions, fright convulsions, and food-related convulsions.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When it comes to convulsions caused by wind, they occur from time to time; among ten children, there are rarely one or two who experience wind convulsions. Generally, those that occur following cold and then heat are due to food-related convulsions. For wind convulsions, one should apply moxibustion according to the diagram; for food convulsions, one should administer the appropriate treatment to recover, with the purple pill being excellent. The reason why children acquire wind convulsions is that they sweat from being too warmly dressed, and then the wind enters. A wind convulsion manifests first with the fingers curling as if counting; this indicates a wind condition. A surprise convulsion arises from fright or loud crying; this is known as a startled convulsion. For mild startled convulsions, one should hold the child firmly and avoid further frightening them, or it may resolve on its own. If it begins without breastfeeding, followed by vomiting and then heat leading to convulsions, this is a food-related convulsion. Treating promptly leads to recovery; the four-flavor purple pill and the expelling drink are most effective, quickly dispelling illness without exhausting the child. The red pill works quickly; for severe cases, it should be used.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text does not have a specific formula for the red pill, and all the doctors&#39; prescriptions do not include it. If the four-flavored purple pill cannot be administered, then one should use the red pill. The red pill acts quickly, and it should be used for severe cases. The first prescription mentioned for post-illness distension is the eight-flavored, named the purple double pill, which uses vermilion color instead of red, along with croton seeds and euphorbia, suggesting it acts faster than the purple pill, and this might indeed be the red pill.</p>
<p>For infants who cannot breastfeed, they should be given the purple pill. When a child is newly born, their vitality is strong, so even slight discomfort requires treatment, and it should not cause harm. Once recovery begins, it will lead to substantial benefits. If treatment is not administered in a timely manner, it can lead to severe illness, which becomes difficult to treat. Among treatments, the four-flavored purple pill is the most effective; although it can be purgative, it does not harm the individual and is sufficient to alleviate sickness. If the four-flavored purple pill cannot be used, then one should resort to the red pill; if the red pill cannot be given, then the dosage should be doubled.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there remains residual heat after treatment, one should prepare Longdan Decoction and take it in small doses, and also apply red ointment. For wind-induced seizures, one should address it with pig heart soup. For fright-induced seizures, one should apply moxibustion according to the prescribed method and also use the nourishing ointment, but it is important not to over-treat. Why? Because fright-induced seizures cause instability in the heart&#39;s qi; if treated too aggressively, it can create further deficiency within, worsening the condition. Those with severe fright-induced seizures are particularly difficult to treat. Therefore, when caring for children, one must be cautious about startling them, avoiding loud noises; when holding them, do so gently and calmly, preventing fright. Also, during thunderstorms, one should protect the child&#39;s ears and minimize disturbing sounds. In general, when nurturing children, some minor shocks are acceptable to promote blood circulation, but one should avoid severe shocks. Severe shocks should be treated with moxibustion on the fright meridian. Moxibustion performed within 50 to 60 days may worsen the fright. After 100 days of life, moxibustion on the fright meridian is beneficial.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>After the beginning of summer, if the child becomes ill, treat them cautiously without excessive cauterization. Do not induce vomiting or diarrhea; instead, bathe them with heat-clearing decoctions and apply heat-clearing powders and red ointments. Also, apply an ointment to the navel, keep the child in a cool place, do not restrict their intake of water or gruels, and always provide fresh water for drinking. </p>
<p>If the child is dressed too lightly, their milk and food will not digest. If digestion is impaired, their stools will have a sour smell; this is a sign of a potential obstruction. In this case, use the purple pill to gradually alleviate the condition. Begin with a small dose, ensuring that their stools remain soft; avoid severe purging. Once the stools are softer and no longer have a sour smell, then stop the medication. Generally, children do not fear purging in winter, while it is difficult to recover from purging in summer.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is illness, it is essential to induce a bowel movement. After this, the lower abdomen should feel slightly distended. Therefore, breastfeeding should be regulated for several days and not taken lightly. Moreover, when nursing a child, the amount should be consistent; as the child grows, it can be gradually increased. If it is decreased, there is likely a minor imbalance in the abdomen; one should take a small amount of medicine and refrain from breastfeeding. Instead, provide milk exclusively; in severe cases, for about ten days, and in milder cases, for five or six days, then breastfeeding can resume as usual. If the child refuses all food and only desires milk, this indicates a more serious condition that requires intervention. It is critical to induce a bowel movement; failure to do so may lead to cold, fever, vomiting, spasms, or even diarrhea. These complications arise from delaying treatment of a serious condition, which can be more difficult to treat later. However, if we address lighter symptoms first, the child will not suffer as much and will recover more quickly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment of Acute Convulsions in Children</h3>
<p>Acute convulsions in children can occur due to loud noises or fright, resulting in spasms that may subside. This condition arises from heat in the heart, indicated by a heated body and a flushed face, thirst, hot breath, and yellowish urine. In severe cases, convulsions may ensue, as excessive heat generates wind, overwhelming Yang and depleting Yin. It is advisable to use the Li Jing Wan to eradicate phlegm and heat, but avoid using medicine containing Dadou.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: According to the &quot;Bao Ying Ji,&quot; symptoms of acute convulsions include tight jaws, high fever, excessive drooling, unusual eye movements, spasms, hot breath, red cheeks, and rapid, strong pulse. This is due to blood deficiency in the liver, where fire moves to generate wind. When wind arises, Yin and blood dissipate, causing Yin fire to escalate; as fire moves, the lung’s metal is depleted, and the liver’s wood becomes excessive. It is beneficial to nourish liver blood and strengthen spleen Qi. If one frequently takes remedies to dispel wind, transform phlegm, and drain fire, it indicates spleen deficiency and blood loss, requiring immediate replenishment of spleen earth. If wind and fire clash, leading to fever and convulsions, eye twitching, and muscular spasms with abundant phlegm, use Si Wu and Diao Teng Gou to nourish liver blood and clear liver fire, along with Si Jun Zi plus Dang Gui to replenish spleen earth and strengthen lung metal. If liver blood is dry and overheated, causing convulsions, eyelid twitching, and abundant phlegm, use Liu Wei Wan to nourish kidney water and Si Jun Zi to supplement spleen earth. </p>
<p>If the lung metal overcomes liver wood, use Liu Jun Zi Tang to strengthen spleen earth, adding Bai Shao and Mu Xiang to balance lung metal. If one has frequently taken convulsion medicines and exhibits deficiency and coldness in spleen and stomach, it is necessary to use Liu Jun Zi Tang to bolster the spleen and stomach, with Ding Xiang and Mu Xiang to support Yang Qi; otherwise, the condition may develop into chronic seizures.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Chronic Shock in Children</strong></p>
<p>Chronic shock in children occurs after illness or from vomiting and diarrhea, or due to the harm caused by medications, leading to cold limbs, weak breath from the mouth and nose, twitching in the hands and feet, and a drowsy state with exposed eyes. This is a condition of deficiency in the spleen, producing wind without yang, and should be treated with Wenyuan Pills. </p>
<p>[Note: According to the &quot;Baoying Ji,&quot; when acute shock frequently recurs and leads to chronic shock due to spleen damage and the depletion of yin, one should replenish the spleen and nourish the blood, assisted by calming and clearing the lungs with proper herbal combinations. I believe that the underlying cause is often due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, where the liver wood overcomes it. Therefore, it is effective to use a variation of Wuwei Yigong Powder supplemented with Angelica and paired with a herbal decoction to replenish the spleen and balance the liver. If this does not work, one should use Liu Jun Decoction with roasted ginger and cardamom to warm and support the spleen; if this also fails, one must urgently add Aconite to restore yang. Using herbs to expel wind and drive out phlegm may dangerously worsen the condition. It is frequently observed that children with weak spleen and stomach conditions develop chronic shock immediately after an illness; one should not mistakenly attribute this to prolonged illness or improper medication leading to chronic conditions. The &quot;Neijing&quot; describes chronic splenic wind, indicating that the spleen is vulnerable to disease, which is evident.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Convulsions caused by fright manifest differently in males and females: males will gaze silently to the left and make sounds while looking to the right, while females will be silent when looking to the right and vocal when looking to the left, as they are opposing each other. Hence, there are signs related to the convulsive episodes. </p>
<p>Note: Most cases arise from issues during the fetal stage, from a nursing mother’s anger affecting the child, or from the child’s own ailments affecting nursing. The signs include vomiting milk and a pale face; if there is phlegm accumulation, the face will be red with heat. It is important to also treat the mother carefully to avoid depleting her vital energy. To determine if the condition is reversed or normal, for males, a fist with the thumb inside the index finger indicates normal; outward indicates reversed. For females, placing the thumb inside the index indicates reversed; outward indicates normal. Additionally, nursing should not resemble treatment for the mother. Follow this procedure accordingly.</p>
<p>If, during the Yin and Yang hours (around early morning), the body exhibits extreme heat, the eyes gaze upwards, the limbs tremble, and there is hot saliva, this indicates a strong liver. At this point, reinforce the kidneys and treat the liver using Di Huang Wan (Rehmannia Pill) and Xie Qing Wan (Clear Green Pill) as the main remedy.</p>
<p>Note: If the patient feels thirsty due to irritation and drinks cold water leading to constipation, Xie Qing Wan is appropriate. If there is fever but they drink warm water and do not experience constipation, Chai Shao Shen Ling San (Bupleurum, Peony, Ginseng, and Poria Powder) should be used. If there is sweating or night sweats due to kidney deficiency causing fluids not to return to their source, Di Huang Wan is the remedy. If strong medicines have been taken or if there is long-term salivation, leading to spleen deficiency causing fluids not to return, Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentleman Decoction) should be employed. The term “strong liver” refers to a deficiency in the liver wood while the pathogenic Qi is excessive; therefore, one should first nourish the mother and then reduce the excess from the child.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it were not for the treatment of the Six Gentlemen Decoction to strengthen the foundation, the condition of slow spleen wind would surely change. If harm from wind leads to convulsions, with heat in the mouth, yawning and restlessness, and trembling of the hands and feet, one should use Da Qing Gao to disperse it.</p>
<p>According to the notes, if the wind injury causes convulsions, one must distinguish whether there is sweating or not, using Da Qing Gao and Xiao Xu Ming Decoction. If the heat in the mouth is strong and the convulsions are vigorous, it indicates a condition that is solid and should use Da Qing Gao to disperse the wind evil. If the mouth is not hot and the convulsions are weak, it indicates a deficiency, and one should use Yi Gong San to tonify the spleen and Liu Wei Wan to nourish the kidney water, and Diao Teng Yin to clear the liver heat. If wind evil and accumulated heat manifest various symptoms, one should treat the lung meridian and clear the wind evil. If the external evil has been eliminated but the symptoms do not improve, one should strengthen the spleen and tonify the lung. If one only treats the lung directly, it risks harming the spleen qi, and various symptoms will arise.</p>

If the blood and qi are not sufficient, they cannot endure, hence the convulsions occur. With heat in the mouth, one should apply common blue ointment to the crown and use bathing or other methods.</p>
<p>(Note: Many antecedent cases are caused by in utero afflictions, or by the mother’s suppressed anger being transmitted to the child, or by the child&#39;s own spleen being damaged. One should primarily focus on restoring the original qi while also addressing the mother’s condition. The child’s nursing cannot be treated similarly. Henceforth, follow this method.)</p>
<p>When a child is newly born, with strong heat and vomiting, the body becomes rigid, hands and feet convulse, and eyes glance up and stare straight. This is referred to as the condition of wind seizure originating from the fetus.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating the five types of epilepsy, one must follow the ailments of the organs. Each organ corresponds to an animal shape, and the use of five-colored pills is for treating minor illnesses. If the condition worsens, it can be fatal, as can severe illnesses. If a patient arches their back and makes a sound like a dog, it indicates liver involvement. If their eyes bulge and they stick out their tongue with a sound like a sheep, it indicates heart involvement. If they have a straight gaze and abdominal pain with a sound like a cow, it indicates spleen involvement. If they jump and extend their hands while making a sound like a chicken, it indicates lung involvement. If the limbs are stiff like a corpse and they foam at the mouth while making a sound like a pig, it indicates kidney involvement.</p>
<p>Commentary: According to traditional beliefs, if a pregnant woman experiences shock or fear, there will be an internal effect on the fetus. The first month affects the Liver, the second month affects the Gallbladder, the third affects the Heart, the fourth month is termed &quot;leaving the path,&quot; the fifth affects the Spleen, the sixth affects the Stomach, the seventh affects the Lungs, the eighth affects the Large Intestine, and the ninth affects the Kidneys. The organs gather energy in the lower abdomen, nourishing from the Liver to the Kidneys through the ten channels. This results from conditions affecting the fetus. After birth, various factors can cause issues such as shocks, irregular milk feeding, or imbalances in the diet and lifestyle of the nursing mother. It&#39;s crucial to determine which channel is affected and to differentiate between Yin and Yang, deficiency and excess, cold and heat, and urgent and mild conditions, primarily to regulate and support the Spleen and Stomach; otherwise, timely intervention may not happen, potentially leading to dire consequences.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Six Diseases in Hejian by Liu Wanshu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infantile Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>When an infant experiences convulsions, their hands and feet may twitch and contract. In such cases, one can use diagnostic methods and formulas to expel the illness. Symptoms include high fever accompanied by aversion to cold, shivering, and confusion, which are all indicative of heat-related conditions associated with the Heart&#39;s Yin deficiency. If the infant displays rigidity, weakness in limbs, restlessness, and muscle spasms, these are related to wind disorders characterized by the Liver&#39;s Yang. </p>
<p>Infants are considered to be children up to the age of six and youths from eighteen onwards. Those under six have no established treatments in the classics. Thus, infants often suffer from ailments that are hard to treat and cannot be definitively diagnosed. Nevertheless, the treatments for children and adults differ significantly. </p>
<p>After birth, infants have fragile bones and soft flesh, and their digestive systems are delicate. They rely on milk and food to nourish their organs, which provides safety and tranquility. However, if they develop stagnation and internal heat affecting the heart, this can lead to convulsions. Continuous convulsions can result in illness. Generally, children are predominantly Yang, possessing more heat than cold. </p>
<p>Infantile convulsions stem from excessive heart fire, which impairs the Metal element, disrupting the Wood element, causing a clash between wind and fire, leading to symptoms such as confusion and convulsions. These signs are indicative of severe heat giving rise to wind.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng)</strong><br><strong>Startling Wind</strong></p>
<p>It is often said that children experience convulsions caused by wind and heat, which is a common ailment. During convulsions, one must strictly avoid grabbing their hands and feet too forcefully, as this can lead to paralysis on one side. If the energy and blood are excessively strong, it may cause numbness in one arm, gradually leading to frailty that becomes difficult to treat in old age. When convulsions occur, place a bamboo mat on the cool ground for the child to lie on, allowing the convulsive energy to circulate through the meridians and stop naturally without causing harm.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Chill and Contraction</strong></p>
<p>Children aged three to five, or those seven to eight, up to more than ten years old, may have fits with frothy salivation, losing consciousness, their eyes wide and breathing rapidly, as though they are on the verge of death. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; these episodes stem from the fear and fright acquired while in the womb, leading to mild shock in some and severe epilepsy and convulsions, along with internal heat accumulation and umbilical wind in others. For the above symptoms, one may use treatments to expel the saliva and medicinal remedies to induce vomiting. Once the vomiting is complete, it is advisable to use cooling medicine such as ruby rhinoceros horn, musk, and other remedies to calm the saliva. If the child is still nursing, the mother should also take medicine to soothe the spirit and stabilize the mind, such as calming pills. If a woman becomes pregnant and experiences fright, worry, or grief, even if she bears a child, it is certain that there will be various ailments.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences internal diarrhea, it may transition into slow shock. If the child stares straight ahead and breathes through a fish-like mouth, it is not advisable to administer purgatives. Instead, it is suitable to focus on nurturing and warming to harmonize.</p>
<p><strong>Acute and Chronic Shock</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, there was no specific differentiation between acute and chronic shock in children, but it was referred to as &quot;Yin-Yang Convulsion.&quot; The terms acute and chronic shock were later coined, similar to the classification of red and white dysentery. Acute shock is associated with Yang energy, which is swift in motion; thus, it is termed acute. In contrast, chronic shock pertains to Yin energy, which is calm and slow, hence its designation as chronic. This distinction highlights the differences in Yin and Yang, deficiency and fullness, cold and heat, and must not be neglected in treatment.</p>
<p>Acute shock stems from heat, which generates wind. It may also arise from fright, manifesting as drooling from the eyes, spasms in the body, and warm breath. Once the onset stabilizes, or when the child awakens, they may return to normal. This indicates acute shock. </p>
<p>As the spasms diminish, one should apply calming medicine to address the heat. After stabilizing the shock, swift action to dispel phlegm-heat and restore the mind to tranquility is crucial for recovery. </p>
<p>Chronic shock often follows a major illness, after vomiting and diarrhea, or due to exhaustion, leading to weakness in the spleen and stomach. Wind evades the body, manifesting as spasms that are not severe. This condition is known as &quot;Epilepsy,&quot; often appearing as lethargy with an unresponsive demeanor, coolness in the limbs and breath. The child may keep their eyes partially open during sleep or cry in pain similar to a crow&#39;s voice, indicating a serious condition likely due to weakness of the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Treating Children’s Frights</strong> </p>
<p>External disturbances should be calmed with Huanglian Anshen Pills. If fright is caused by Qi movement, use Hanshuishi Anshen Pills. One must avoid using Fangfeng Pills for wind; warming and spicy medications can certainly be fatal. Why is this? Warming and dispersing herbs are yang; heat is fire, which can harm the mother (Earth) and support the excessive Qi of the child (Wood), leading to death. If fright leads to a bluish color and diarrhea, one should first calm the liver with substances like vermillion. Do not use cold or cooling substances; avoid using cold fright pills. If wind and Wood are strong, they will counter the spleen and stomach, so it is necessary to first bolster the Earth, and then drain the Wood. Yan Xiaozhong compiled the Qian family&#39;s formulas to benefit the yellow and replenish the Earth. These remedies contain clove, which is spicy and warming, enhancing fire, thus causing the Earth to become even more deficient. The green tangerine peel drains the Lung and Metal; clove, being spicy and warming, severely drains the Lung and Large Intestine. When the spleen is plentiful, one can drain the child; but if the spleen and stomach are deficient, to further drain the child and increase fire is to severely weaken the Earth, which without a doubt leads to death. In cases of strong wind and Wood, the right pulse is rapid and strong, the palms are hot, and the belly skin is warm—how can one assist fire to drain Metal? If cold water invades the spleen and Earth, the symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, and bluish-white diarrhea, for which Yihuang San is the sacred remedy. Now we prepare Huangqi Decoction, to first drain fire and replenish Metal, greatly strengthening the Earth, which is the method for divine healing.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Inward Wind</strong></p>
<p>Shock is shock, wind is wind; it is crucial to differentiate clearly and not mix treatments. Shock occurs from seeing abnormal forms or strange objects, disputes, falls, or encounters with water, fire, or beasts, leading to startled spirits and qi stagnation that produces phlegm. Phlegm obstructs qi, causing spasms, crooked mouth and eyes, and drooling. One may suddenly return to normal as if nothing happened. It can recur daily or several times a day, or every few days, month, or half-year. If not treated urgently, it may transform into a chronic seizure disorder, becoming a lifelong ailment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The wind affliction can arise from external exposure to wind and cold, or from internal injuries due to improper diet, leading to internal heat. This heat generates phlegm, which in turn causes convulsions.

The treatment should first drain heat and resolve phlegm, and then use methods to clear heat and calm the spirits.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For any child with a slight fever, when observing their cheeks as red and their eyes looking upward, they are likely to have a convulsion. One should first use a cooling powder with lampwick and mint to reduce the heat, and then give Baolong pills to calm the spirit, which will prevent the onset of convulsions.</p>
<p>During a convulsion, if the hands are scattered, the eyes are closed, the mouth is gaping, there is a fish-like gasp, drooling, incoherence, not speaking or crying, and a complete refusal of food and drink, with involuntary urination and defecation, and a red face as if painted, none can be treated at that moment.</p>
<p>For children with lingering convulsions, their constitution may be weak, often with multiple illnesses. They may have severe vomiting and diarrhea, chronic malaria or dysentery, or have had adverse reactions to medications that induce vomiting or diarrhea, all leading to a weakening of the spirit, gradually resulting in spasms, with a recovery rate of only one in ten. This is due to the weakness of the vital energy, further exacerbated by fear.</p>
<p>The symptoms appear normal once passed, but there may be excessive crying, restlessness during sleep. One should not recklessly use phlegm-dissolving medications. First use Qingzhou white pills combined with Qinglong stone to eliminate phlegm, and then administer calming pills with Si Junzi Decoction to regulate accordingly. If after severe vomiting or diarrhea the hands and feet turn cold, and the child sleeps deeply with eyes partially open but no spasms, this indicates the potential onset of chronic convulsions. One should urgently warm and nourish, using Si Junzi Decoction with pan roasted sour jujube seed, dry ginger, and large dates as guides, boiled in water and administered frequently, regulating based on the warmth in hands and feet. In severe cases, add a slice of cooked Aconite. After recovery, use Jisheng pills to adjust.</p>
<p>In treating chronic convulsions, one must avoid recklessly using spicy or aromatic medicines, as they can drive away the vital energy, and cold medications can harm the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of children&#39;s convulsions, it is essential to distinguish between acute and chronic causes. Acute involves real heat resulting in coldness seeking relief, while chronic pertains to deficiency and cold requiring warming tonics. Acute occurs from wind, cold, or food accumulation, while chronic arises from prolonged illness. Accurately distinguishing these conditions reveals exceptional skill.</p>
<p>Acute convulsions emerge suddenly with great heat, which can lead to wind. Phlegm and fluids block the throat, causing facial and oral distortion and heaviness. First, use the Sneezing Marvel Powder, followed by the Guide Red method to clear blockages. Moxa should be applied to the Lesser Shang and Middle Chong points, using the cooling methods for heat and convulsions.</p>
<p>Chronic convulsions are often a result of severe illness, with a sudden decline in spirit and spleen deficiency. The affected child may appear lethargic, sighing heavily, with an open mouth and distorted face. There may be moments of twitching, with limbs becoming cold. The method of warming and expelling should be applied urgently to the interior, and if not healed, moxibustion should be performed on the left breast.</p>
<p>If the condition is due to external cold, sweating should be induced first. A decoction of cooling pills can be supplemented with scorpion and silkworm. If it is indeed due to internal injury from food, it must be accompanied by purging. Use the Three Yellow and Five Colors as necessary to eliminate heat and stop convulsions.</p>
<p>To recognize alarming signs of convulsions, the face may appear reddened like it is painted. The mouth may be open, with saliva flowing and teeth clenched, breathing rapidly and voice hoarse. The throat may feel as though it is being pulled by a saw, and sweat may appear like beads. The eyes may bulge and twitch, and loud cries may arise from fear.</p>
<p>The condition might see sudden onset and cessation of convulsions, with phlegm and qi in constant turmoil. In a faint, stuporous state, there may be no awareness of eating or swallowing. Urine and feces may be expelled without perception, and the limbs may be rigid and difficult to retract. The cry is urgent, with hot sweat resembling oil; even potent elixirs may offer no salvation.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<h3>On Treating Fright-Induced Illness</h3>
<p>According to various books, sudden fright is easy to treat, while chronic fright is difficult to treat; this has been a common understanding through the ages. The insights derived from wise individuals suggest that there is a unique methodology behind this, with recorded treatments embodying the subtle essences of true immortals. Similar to when a child suffers from illness due to fright, cold, heat, phlegm, or food, each has its origin. The methods of treatment are exceptionally different from common knowledge. For instance, cold pertains to the bladder, fright heat to the heart, wind to the liver, and phlegm and food to the spleen and stomach. According to the teachings of the Tang family on the young, fright and phlegm commonly follow each other, and it is crucial to observe the location and color of the pulse to uncover the underlying causes of the illness for effective treatment.</p>
<h3>Fright</h3>
<p>The pulse can be found at three points: the temples, the forehead, and the area between the eyebrows.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

Additionally, there are over a hundred recorded formulas by different practitioners, each boasting its strengths, yet the Qian family’s pulse diagnosis is superior to others.

<p><strong>Fright</strong></p>
<p>Acute fright, a result of excessive liver wind with accompanying heart fire. Wood generates fire; if it arises from a prior condition, it should be expelled. The remedy Qingwan pills should be used to clear the liver wind, and Daochi powder to reduce heart fire. Chronic fright, as described by Qian, occurs when spleen deficiency causes phlegm and wind; this is due to weakened spleen earth allowing liver wood to dominate. The liver belongs to wood and the spleen to earth, thus the invading evil is difficult to combat, making chronic fright hard to treat. For spleen deficiency causing wind, one should supplement. Dongyuan recommends the Tiaoyuan decoction with added white peony to remedy this; it uses astragalus and ginseng to nourish spleen deficiency, while white peony and licorice drain excess from the liver. This is indeed an ancient and rarely transmitted secret method. I add cinnamon to make it the Huangqi Jianzhong decoction; wood with cinnamon becomes wilted. Traditional methods for treating chronic fright include Jingpi powder and Xian gao powder, both effective remedies.</p>
<p>Someone asked: How should a skilled practitioner treat acute and chronic fright before they occur? The answer: When the heat is extreme, with flushed cheeks, a red face, and eyes fixed and unblinking, these are signs of fright. One should take Hekian Danggui Longhui pills to clear liver and gallbladder fire, preventing the onset of acute fright. When there is persistent vomiting or diarrhea, with cold hands and feet, sleepy eyes, and cool breath from the mouth and nose, these symptoms indicate a tendency toward chronic fright. One should urgently use Shenling Baizhu powder to nourish the spleen and the Hupo Baolong pills, removing bitter orange peel and adding astragalus to pacify the liver, preventing the development of chronic fright. This is my family’s secret method.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After the shock, if the qi does not disperse, it becomes stagnant and produces phlegm. This phlegm generates heat, and the heat causes wind, leading to convulsions. This is what Chen describes as qi reversing and causing convulsions, which brings about shock. This is different from the term &quot;sudden wind.&quot;</p>
<p>For those who convulse due to shock, it indicates that the heart fire is strong and the liver wood is overpowering it. First, we should stop the convulsions and administer a decoction made with Zhikang San, swallowing it along with Hejian Danggui Longhui Wan; then calm the spirit using Qian&#39;s Anshen Wan. For those with phlegm and fluid obstruction, first reduce the phlegm using Chen Sha Gao, then stop the convulsions, and finally calm the spirit.</p>
<p>Acute shock wind belongs to yang, and conditions in the six fu organs are easier to treat with cooling and purging methods. Chronic shock wind belongs to yin, and conditions in the five zang organs are harder to treat and require warming and tonifying methods.</p>
<p>Someone might ask: Why are there both acute and chronic, yin and yang conditions? I would say: The liver governs wind, which is wood. No movement is as sudden and rapid as wind. The heart governs shock, which is fire. Nothing is as violent and soaring as fire. Thus, both wood and fire are yang; therefore, when the condition affects the heart and liver, it is considered acute and belongs to yang. The spleen and stomach represent earth, which is heavy and slow, more so than earth itself. The spleen belongs to the extreme yin, so when the condition affects the spleen, it is considered chronic and belongs to yin. The liver is generally in excess; when in excess, it can spill over and damage itself. The spleen is generally insufficient; when insufficient, it needs to be supplemented and benefited. While the heart governs shock and the liver governs wind, they should rightly be discussed together. Fire contributes to the force of wind, and wind aids the power of fire, thus they can induce convulsions together, so they should not be treated separately. There are overlapping manifestations and similar symptoms of shock wind that should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Causes of Sudden Fever</strong></p>
<p>There are three causes of sudden fever:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>External Causes</strong>: Such as contracting wind, cold, or dampness leading to fever. In this case, it is advisable to expel and harmonize to eliminate the heat. If this is neglected and left untreated, severe heat can lead to convulsions. For illnesses caused by this, the use of Daohong San (Peach Blossom Powder) and Xieqing Wan (Clear Green Pill) is appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Internal Causes</strong>: Such as fever from overeating or poor digestion. It is necessary to eliminate and guide downwards, using medications like Baohuan Wan or Sanhuang Zhizhu Wan to clear the heat. If neglected and untreated, severe heat can lead to convulsions. One should observe the condition of bowel movements. If there is constipation, one should first eliminate retained food, using Wuxiang Binglang Wan or bile-guiding methods. If the stool is loose, the appropriate remedies are Chensha Wuling San or Hupo Baolong Wan.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Neither Internal Nor External Causes</strong>: Occurs due to shock or fright. The heart houses the spirit, and fright can harm the spirit; the kidneys contain will and essence, and fear can damage the kidneys. The classics say: the movement of the spirit is called the soul, and the entry and exit of essence is called the po. Thus, if the spirit is harmed, the soul departs; if the essence is harmed, the po disperses. Children are typically timid and weak in spirit, so sudden fright can disrupt their mental state, causing the soul and po to scatter, with reversed qi and phlegm accumulation leading to convulsions. If fright occurs unexpectedly, even adults can be startled, let alone children. It is advisable to first clear the phlegm using Chensha Gao (Cinnabar Ointment) and then calm the spirit using Hupo Baolong Wan. For cases of heat, use Dongyuan Anshen Wan (Calm the Shen Pill). When using medications to clear phlegm, one should be cautious not to use harsh substances like light powder or Ba Dou, as they may harm the vital energy, damage the spleen and stomach, and endanger the child’s life.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After a fright</p>
<p>For those who develop abscesses and paralysis after a fright, the Left School suggests it is due to the wind&#39;s disturbance causing later illness. The liver governs the tendons; if the liver is hot, the tendons become elongated and weak, preventing the hands and feet from bending. If the liver is cold, the tendons contract and shorten, preventing the hands and feet from extending. In both cases, the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill is recommended. For contraction, add aconite and cinnamon; for weakness, add goldthread, anemarrhena, angelica, achyranthes, and gentian. These should be taken in honey pills. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>The heart stores the spirit; when startled, it injures the spirit. The kidneys store the will; when fearful, it injures the will. Children with weak spirits become frightened; when startled, their spirits lose their guard, resulting in epilepsy. As it is said in texts, when one requests a monk to write a name and the monk performs a blessing, if the child is frightened, this can lead to epilepsy. Later, upon seeing someone in black clothing, the condition may recur. There are also cases where prolonged fright causes epilepsy; if addressed early, it can be treated with specific formulas. If parents neglect it for long, it becomes a lifelong affliction.</p>
<p><strong>Tian Diao (Heavenly Hook) and Nei Diao (Inner Hook)</strong></p>
<p>The Tian Diao corresponds to the foot Jueyin liver channel, beginning at the big toe and ascending around the genital area, crossing left to right and right to left, entering the lower abdomen, connecting with the Governing Vessel, and traveling up the spine to the crown. If wind harms the liver, it causes Tian Diao, characterized by upward-rolling eyes, the head tilted back, and the body bending backward like a bow. Qian says: when the liver is affected by wind, it causes extreme bowing. Tian Diao belongs to wood and should be dispersed; for this, one should use Qingxiao Pill, removing Da Huang, and adding Tianma, Quanxie, Jiangcan, and Diao Teng.</p>
<p>Nei Diao occurs when the liver is cold, presenting as lower abdominal pain, loud crying, and direct gaze, but without ear twitching. It should be urgently warmed internally using Angelica and Cornelian Cherry Decoction and Wood Fragrance Pill. </p>
<p>If asked: Tian Diao and Nei Diao concerning the disease and what organ they belong to, and how to distinguish them, one may refer to the classic: if the affliction is above half of the body, it is governed by heavenly energy; if below that, it is governed by earthly energy.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the external channels of the Great Hook are located above, born from wind and heat, and should be dispelled; the internal channels of the Inner Hook are located below, born from cold, and should be warmed. Both hooks are connected to the Jueyin meridian, externally following the Du meridian, ascending along the spine to reach the top of the head. When there is illness, the eyes may roll upwards, and the back may arch, resembling a bowstring that has been forcibly pulled. Internally, they follow the yin energy into the lower abdomen, causing pain that may be mistaken for a cyst. Dizziness from wind belongs to the liver’s wood aspect, hence both hooks exhibit symptoms of twitching, as if startled. However, the external hook may cry or laugh, while the internal hook tends to produce weeping sounds. The disease of convulsions belongs to the Yangming bladder meridian, beginning from the eyes, passing over the head, and descending along the back of the hands, following the waist down. This is similar to the downward flow of the Jueyin meridian, hence the symptoms of bowstring tension are also similar. However, while the external hook may twitch, the convulsion disease does not manifest twitching. Pain in the intestines belongs to the Yangming small intestine meridian. Internally, it travels through the lower abdomen, differing from the path of the Jueyin meridian, which can lead to sudden pain in the lower abdomen. However, the internal hook may exhibit spasms, while the pain in the intestines does not display discernible spasms.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secrets of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heavenly and Internal Seizures</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly seizure resembles epilepsy. The symptoms are intense heat and palpitations, with rolling eyes and seizures in the limbs, alternating between crying and laughing, having fluctuating emotions; in severe cases, the nails turn blue, resembling a demonic affliction. This is related to liver disease but does not involve drowsiness. It is advisable to dispel wind and resolve the evil to achieve recovery, and the remedy is Dai Tong San (a type of herbal formula).</p>
<p>Internal seizure also resembles epilepsy. The symptoms include abdominal pain and frequent crying, blackened lips and cysts, hunched posture, and red streaks or spots in the eyes. This, too, is liver disease but does not cause confusion or lethargy; rather, it is caused by cold air. Initially, there will be spasms of internal organs, leading to extreme pain and frantic cries that can cause diarrhea and leg retraction, along with abdominal pain and crying. After the internal seizure passes, external symptoms such as seizure recur, and with internal and external attacks, it becomes extremely difficult to regulate; treatment requires both internal and external medicine. In severe cases of internal seizures, it is advisable to use a balm of frankincense.</p>
<p>According to the two symptoms of heavenly and internal seizures, many infants suffer from them within a hundred days. Both of these conditions are related to liver disease. The liver meridian, known as Jue Yin, internally connects to the small intestine and externally to the back; therefore, external wind-heat results in heavenly seizures, while internal cold damage leads to internal seizures. Hence, it is said: heavenly seizures are yang, while internal seizures are yin.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Children&#39;s Disorders of Sudden Convulsion</p>
<pre><code>        Infants&#39; Questions [Ming Dynasty, Lu Bosi]

            Convulsions
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of sudden convulsions, first observe the clenched fists. If the fingers are inward, it indicates a passive condition; if outward, it is active. For males, the left side is associated with convulsions; for females, the right side. One must use medications to open the channels thoroughly. It is critical to avoid phlegm entering the lung or reversing into the heart, which can cause an inability to speak. In such cases, one should administer calming heart medicine and phlegm-reducing drugs to stabilize. If the convulsion is reversed, immediate assistance is futile. If the condition arises from vomiting or diarrhea, it will be difficult to treat. Generally, one should observe the nature of the clenched fists; if the convulsion is in order, regulation is easier; if reversed, there may be a recurrence. Start with opening channel medicines like &quot;Sheng Nian Er&quot; and &quot;Bao Ming Dan,&quot; followed by medications to disperse wind, resolve phlegm, and reduce heat, usually ensuring safety.</p>
<p>There are also instances of convulsions due to fright, excessive crying, sudden convulsions with tears from the eyes, and a red face indicating difficulty in recovery. If the child becomes overly emotional with phlegm accumulation in the heart, visible red veins on the face indicate epilepsy. Mismanaged convulsive patterns can lead to further incidences of fright and excessive sinking, where the wind illness does not dissipate and is counter to the qi. The convulsion becomes erratic, thus one should switch to qi-dispelling wind medications, using &quot;Wen Dan Tang&quot; mixed with sour jujube seeds, followed by &quot;Sheng Feng Tang&quot; and &quot;Hua Su Qing Wan.&quot; </p>
<p>In cases of sudden partial convulsions, if the face turns pale and the back feels cold, treatment is acceptable for males on the left and females on the right; but for males on the right and females on the left, it is more challenging. If there is cold sweat in the palms, and the child convulses in the brow and abdomen, is unstable day and night, this is termed true convulsion.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When both shoulders move, this is a sign of seizure; it not only stabilizes the convulsion but also requires the regulation of Qi. At this moment, one should take soup to settle the stomach Qi; then administer medicines like Chuanwu and Quanxie, alongside Qi-regulating medicines, while ensuring proper circulation. Zhong Yang discusses convulsions that occur after wind. If convulsions arise after catching a cold, with hot breath from the mouth, feelings of drowsiness, and trembling hands and feet, one should disperse the condition, using Da Qing Gao as the primary treatment. </p>
<p>If convulsions ensue after food injury, accompanied by body warmth, excessive sleep, excessive salivation, or reluctance to eat leading to convulsions, one must first stabilize the convulsions, eliminate them, using white cakes, and then take calming pills. Furthermore, if convulsions occur within a hundred days, genuine cases result in death after three or four times, while false cases recur frequently but are not severe. Genuine cases stem from internal excitement, while false cases arise from external cold wind. This signifies that the blood and Qi are not sufficient, leading to convulsions. </p>
<p>To distinguish false cases, observe that hot breath emerges from the mouth; treatment should focus on dispersal using Da Qing Gao, while employing external methods such as pearl pills to eliminate phlegm will stop the convulsions. For those with heat and no bowel movement, using the Seven Treasures Heart Washing Powder for dispersion will be effective. Furthermore, one should employ methods to intercept wind and stabilize convulsions with Tianma Fangfeng pills, Longchi Powder, and Diaoteng Powder for regulation. For cases with heat sores or inability to speak, Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder and Dalianqiao Decoction are both suitable for administration.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Shock</strong></p>
<p>Sudden shock occurs when a child has excessive heat-phlegm affecting the heart and stomach. When they hear an unusual sound, it causes sudden fright and spasms. If the heat is extreme, even without any external stimulus or shock, they may still experience spasms. Symptoms of sudden shock include tightness of the jaw, intense heat with a swelling of saliva, erratic eye movement, spasms and trembling (the fingers open and close), frequent blinking of the lips, mouth, eyebrows, and eyes, hot breath, flushed cheeks and lips, yellowish urine and stools, with a pulse that is floating, rapid, surging, and tense. This is due to internal excess heat combined with wind pathogenic factors; the heart channel is affected by heat leading to accumulation of shock, while the liver channel produces wind causing spasms. </p>
<p>The main treatment involves using medications in an orderly fashion. After opening the channels, one should focus on stopping wind and stabilizing spasms. If phlegm-heat is still present, it should be resolved; once phlegm-heat is discharged, immediate attention should be given to harmonizing the stomach and stabilizing the mind. If spasms are resolved and phlegm-heat is reduced, then lighter medications to eliminate phlegm and heat can be sufficient. It is crucial to act quickly when addressing sudden shock, and one must not excessively use cold and cool agents or harsh substances like silver powder or mirabilite abruptly. Such heavy medications should only be used when absolutely necessary, as they only alleviate the condition temporarily. Incorrect or excessive use can often lead to chronic shock. </p>
<p>This condition can also be treated by opening the nose and clearing the channels, inducing sneezing; once the jaw is relaxed, gentler medications to disperse wind, transform phlegm, and reduce heat, such as Daodi San, Chai Hu, and Tian Ma, can be safely administered. The Amber Powder is a key remedy for various types of shock. The Zhibao Dan can also be taken.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sometimes one experiences day and night sweating, spleen dysfunction leading to excessive sleep, irritability prompting thirst, swelling of the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, toxic growths, abdominal pain with a sensation of tightness around the waist, rapid onset of ulceration, and a gradual transmission of symptoms. If vomiting and diarrhea lead to a state of deficiency, the condition will worsen quickly. The treatment must be based on careful inquiry into the root causes; one cannot indiscriminately use medication referred to as a gradual transmission.</p>
<p>If the condition arises from vomiting or diarrhea, then administer the Li Zhong Tang (Regulate the Middle Decoction) with the addition of Mu Xiang to warm the interior, or use Wu Ling San (Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria) to guide out excess fluids. If it arises from cold in the organs leading to loose stools, then first administer the Shu Fu Tang (Atractylodes and Aconite Decoction). If it results from accumulated food leading to a downward shift, first use the Tiao Qi San (Regulate Qi Powder) to harmonize the spleen and stomach. If it is an external attack of wind-cold, then formulas such as Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) or Ge Gen Tang (Kudzu Decoction) may be appropriate, and others can be inferred accordingly.</p>
<p>However, though chronic fright belongs to yin, one must still assess the balance of yin and yang in terms of deficiency and excess, shallow and deep conditions. One cannot purely rely on warming medicines or strong, overly hot formulas. Instead, it is vital to add medications that stabilize wind and calm spasms to strengthen the genuine qi of the stomach, such as Quan Xie (Scorpion), Hua She (Snake), Jiang Can (Silkworm), Bai Fu Zi (White Convolvulus), Tian Ma (Gastrodia), and Nan Xing (Arisaema).</p>
<p>For cases of gradual transmission still displaying yang symptoms, there is no need to restore yang, but one should employ strategies to stabilize wind and regulate the stomach, whether cooling or warming, ensuring a balanced approach to yin and yang.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

Signs include sticking out the tongue and shaking the head, a pale face with hair standing on end, vomiting with a foul smell, and sweating on the forehead.

Immediately intercept the wind and awaken the spleen with a decoction, or use Si Jun Zi Decoction with full scorpion and wind-protecting herbs, or Yin Bai San, or Diao Teng Decoction in place of Ma Huang. It is beneficial to prepare various medicines and food early, and one must not take it lightly. </p>

Children naturally possess a lot of heat; if they are affected by wind evils, the wind-heat combines in the organs, causing the qi to become stagnant, which unsettles the heart and disrupts the child&#39;s spirit, thus resulting in fright. If the fright is severe and persists, it leads to palpitations. This is treated with Zi Jin San, Niu Huang San, and Da Dan Sha Wan.

<p>In the case of chronic spleen wind, the face is pale, the tongue is short, and the head is lowered. The eyes are closed and cannot be opened; during sleep, the head sways and the tongue is thrust out. There are frequent occurrences of vomiting with a foul odor, the mouth is tightly shut and the teeth are clenched. The hands and feet may twitch slightly but cannot be fully retracted. The body may be cold or warm, but the limbs are cold. The pulse is faint and submerged, indicating an extreme excess of yin energy and a significant deficiency of stomach energy, with a ratio of ten to one or two saved. This condition arises after chronic fright, which damages the spleen through vomiting and diarrhea. The illness manifests fully as a deficiency, primarily affecting the spleen, hence it is referred to as spleen wind. If one tries to expel the wind, there is no wind to chase away; if one attempts to treat fright, there is no fright to treat. Instead, phlegm and fluids stagnate in the spleen due to virtual heat. The inability to open the eyes indicates the spleen is exhausted and energy is lacking, causing a state of confusion and stagnation of phlegm and fluids. What is commonly known as chronic wind difficult to treat pertains to chronic spleen wind. Furthermore, chronic spleen wind is also referred to as virtual wind. Generally, after a child has experienced vomiting or diarrhea, they exhibit a pale yellow complexion and a significant overall deficiency.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>Epilepsy is a severe illness that affects young children. Their immature blood vessels and undeveloped bones are vulnerable to the invasion of wind pathogens, startled by sudden fright, or disrupted due to irregular breastfeeding, which obstructs the meridians leading to this condition. Symptoms include a disturbed spirit, wide-open eyes staring blankly, facial contortions, a clenched mouth with drooling, a bloated abdomen, and spasms in the hands and feet, appearing as if they are alive but often unresponsive. They may alternate between vocalizing and silence, with either arching back or rigidity in the spine, while the limbs remain soft; this is termed epilepsy. If the body is rigid and unresponsive for the entire day, it is termed convulsion. </p>
<p>Epilepsy is classified into five types, each affecting one of the five organs. If the face is red and eyes tense, with tongue protrusion and teeth grinding, along with restlessness in the heart region and shortness of breath, it is called heart epilepsy. If the face and lips turn blue, the eyes roll upwards, and the hands and feet clench and spasm, it is referred to as liver epilepsy. A blackened and dull face, bulging eyes, and the mouth producing clear foam while remaining motionless like a corpse indicates kidney epilepsy.

<p>For wind convulsion, if sweating occurs, it indicates release, and the wind pathogen takes advantage of weakness; initially, there may be a bending of the fingers with heat producing phlegm. </p>
<p>For fright convulsion, there is shock and terror, leading to a collapse from fright; initially, there may be loud crying, confusion, and loss of the spirit. </p>

For wind-induced epilepsy, first disperse the wind; for shock-induced epilepsy, eliminate the shock; for food-induced epilepsy, first resolve the accumulation, and then use the appropriate calming agents. Generally, blood stasis in the heart or evil qi in the heart, along with accumulated shock leads to epilepsy. It is essential to clear heart shock, harmonize heart blood, regulate qi, and eliminate phlegm. Moreover, when children experience heat and phlegm, show reluctance to breastfeed, have restless sleep, and frequently experience fright and palpitations, these are all early signs of impending epilepsy, and can be addressed with Zisong pill. If the dose of Zisong pill is appropriately reduced, the risk of shock-induced epilepsy will diminish. At the onset of symptoms, if there are blue veins appearing between high bones, and they resemble coins, they must be immediately pricked to allow bloodletting, helping to clear the qi.

<p>Startled refers to a state of empty anxiety and confusion; the spirit is timid and dispersed, phlegm and saliva come and go. Its outflow is invariably green, gradually producing wind without yet reaching it. When the startled pathogenic influence enters the heart, the face turns red and one experiences restless nighttime weeping. If it enters the liver, the face becomes green, and the eyes dart about. When it affects the kidneys, the face darkens, leading to fierce cries and grinding of teeth. If it afflicts the lungs, the face becomes pale, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue. If it enters the spleen, there is vomiting and inability to eat, excessive sweating during sleep, and a pale yellow complexion. Observing the pulse, if it is weak, it is scattered and moist; if strong, it is rapid and thick. The treatment method involves soothing the startled condition and transforming phlegm, calming the spirit, and stabilizing the will, while also understanding which organ is affected to offer appropriate adjustments.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heavenly Induced Convulsion</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly convulsion occurs when excessive consumption of alcohol and meat by the nursing mother causes toxic energies to enter the milk, leading the infant to develop internal heat in the heart and lungs, along with phlegm accumulation and qi stagnation. Additionally, external wind pathogens may contribute to this condition. The treatment principle is to disperse and relieve wind-heat for recovery. </p>
<p>There is also another type of convulsion induced internally, resulting from cold qi blockage coupled with fright. The classics state: when internal convulsions cause elevation of the chest, the symptoms may intermittently stabilize, and the appearance of red veins at the corners of the eyes is indicative. This condition arises from the presence of wind and fright in the womb, hence the symptoms.</p>
<p>Initially, there may be violent jerking in the internal organs accompanied by intense pain, causing the child to scream, or there may be diarrhea and cramping of the legs, and the child will cry out in pain. Once the internal symptoms pass, the external jerks may return, creating a challenging situation of internal and external conflict that is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>It is critical to address both aspects separately. For the internal condition, administer Ju Bao Pills, Diaoteng Paste, and Wei Xiang Powder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Sudden and Chronic Wind Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: All winds causing dizziness are related to the liver element. In children under eight years old, they are considered pure Yang; their true water is not yet strong, and the heart fire is already inflamed. Therefore, the lung channel is restrained, unable to balance the wood element, leading to an excess of liver wood and a deficiency of spleen earth. For parents, if they neglect proper care—either by inappropriately adjusting clothing to the weather, allowing external evils to invade, or by mismanaging food intake, causing damage to the middle Qi—this is why conditions of sudden and chronic wind disorders arise.</p>
<p>Sudden wind disorders pertain to an excess of liver wind evil; thus, treatment should involve clearing, cooling, bitter, cold, and Qi-dispelling medicines. Chronic wind disorders relate to a deficiency of spleen earth and middle Qi; hence, treatment should involve harmonizing, sweet, warm, and tonifying medicines.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden wind disorders, these may arise from hearing unusual sounds or encountering the frightening behaviors of animals, resulting in a pale face, clenched mouth, or hoarse voice with syncope. After the episode, the complexion may return to normal, but after a while, symptoms may reappear, with the body heated and the face reddened, leading to thirst, hot sensations in the mouth and nose, yellow or reddish urine, and sleeplessness. If the heat is severe, it generates phlegm; if phlegm becomes severe, it generates wind, which can occasionally lead to seizures. The appropriate treatments include Qian’s Li Jing Pills, Xie Qing Pills, Bao Long Pills, Yi Feng San, and Wu Fu Hua Du Dan, among others.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms of chronic fright are often caused by irregular diet, which damages the spleen and stomach, leading to prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in a significant deficiency of vital energy. When spasms occur, they are endless; the body feels cold, the complexion is yellow, there is no thirst, and the breath from the mouth and nose is cold. The urine and stool are pale, there is drowsiness with open eyes, upward gaze of the eyes, and spasms in the hands and feet with muscular rigidity. It is said that a deficiency in the spleen generates wind; when wind is rampant, the muscles become tense. This condition, often referred to as &quot;sky-hanging wind,&quot; corresponds to these signs. Treatment should include Dongyuan&#39;s Astragalus Decoction, Qian&#39;s Diao Teng Pill, Wenbai Pill, and Danxi&#39;s Ginseng and Atractylodes Decoction, combined with Zhu Sha An Shen Pill and similar remedies. Qian&#39;s theory posits that acute fright is an absence of Yin, caused by excess heat in the heart meridian, resulting in an inability of Yin to balance Yang, thus manifesting as excessive Yang and deficient Yin. Conversely, chronic fright is seen as an absence of Yang, due to severe deficiency in the spleen and earth element, leading to an inability of Yang to overcome Yin, thus manifesting as excessive Yin and deficient Yang. </p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the symptoms of acute and chronic fright in children can differ immensely in terms of deficiency and excess, as if they were worlds apart. Therefore, the mortality rate for acute fright is one in ten, whereas the mortality rate for chronic fright is one in ten for survival. Many common practitioners do not understand these principles, treating them indiscriminately, which leads to great harm. Those specializing in pediatrics should strive to understand the child’s heart as their own heart, so that this world may have no premature deaths among young children.

<p><strong>Children&#39;s Illnesses Primarily Affect the Liver and Spleen Channels</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s illnesses generally belong to the channels of the spleen (Earth) and liver (Wood). The liver often has an excess, and excess symptoms, while appearing severe, are easier to treat and improve quickly. The spleen, on the other hand, tends to be deficient. Deficiency symptoms may seem mild and gradual, making treatment more difficult, with results taking longer. Among the two channels, the spleen is more frequently affected, and it is crucial to differentiate the treatment based on this. </p>
<p>If the liver (Wood) is overly vigorous, it results in sudden fright, straight gaze, potential shaking, and twitching of the limbs, as well as symptoms of phlegm and wind obstructing upward. This indicates an excess, and treatment should focus on reducing the Wood, draining the liver, and lowering fire to clear the heart. </p>
<p>If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, and the liver (Wood) comes to insult it, symptoms like fright and twitching may also appear but tend to be mild and gradual; this is termed chronic fright. In this case, it is important to nourish the spleen and stomach, avoiding misdiagnosing the spleen channel as the one needing treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For sudden fright due to wind and fire, with the spleen (Earth) being constrained and the liver channel having full heat, one can use Qing Pills to directly drain the liver or Dao Chi Powder to relieve heat. If the liver channel has deficiency heat, using Liu Wei Di Huang Wan can nourish the kidney water, while Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction can strengthen the spleen (Earth), allowing the wind and wood to settle and restoring peace to the spleen.</p>
<p>If due to improper milk and food intake, there is damage to the spleen and stomach, leading the Wood to insult the Earth, it may resemble chronic fright with symptoms such as twitching, head shaking, and teeth grinding; for this, one should use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added Diao Teng (Uncaria). If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach, with cold water countering the Earth, causing chronic fright and the previous symptoms, add ginger and cinnamon to the previous remedies. If there is still no response, increase Aconite, as many recover from this method.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Acute fright is a symptom of excess, related to the liver wood and heart fire. When the yang evil is too strong, it should be directly purged; thus, lowering fire and resolving phlegm is necessary. All five organs have their yin and yang; the liver qi is yang and fire, while the liver blood is yin and water. When the liver qi is abundant, the liver blood will be deficient; when fire moves recklessly, the water will be boiled and disturbed. Strong yang causes weak yin. When wind and fire clash, yin and blood scatter, which is inevitable; therefore, nourishing blood is also necessary. Although acute fright is associated with the liver and heart, if wood and fire are strong, the lung metal will be impaired and unable to control wood, which harms the earth element. Hence, it is also essential to nourish the spleen. Furthermore, the medications for treating fright generally focus on dispelling wind, transforming phlegm, and aggressively lowering fire, with strong scents of musk that easily consume yin blood and harm the spleen and stomach. Therefore, for the treatment of excess acute fright, it is crucial to first lower fire and resolve phlegm; after one or two doses, add blood-nourishing and calming medications. If there is decreased appetite, loose stools, or vomiting and diarrhea, supplementary treatment of the spleen and stomach should be included. If there is an original deficiency of the spleen and stomach, then in the purgative medicine, add spleen tonics.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one frequently takes purgative and anti-epileptic medications, it is advisable to recognize this as a deficiency of the spleen and scattered blood. For treating epilepsy, one should add tonifying blood and spleen medications and avoid warm or hot herbs like cloves, for fear they may aid stomach heat. It is better to use ginseng, atractylodes, and peony to replenish the spleen&#39;s qi and blood, while using ophiopogon and coptis to clear the metal&#39;s grasp on wood. </p>
<p>In the case of symptoms related to wind-heat in the liver channel, such as convulsions, eye twitching, tense muscles, and excessive phlegm, one may use the Four Substance Decoction to generate liver blood, alongside the hook of the fishing vine to clear heat from sweat, and then add the Four Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen&#39;s earth. If the liver channel&#39;s blood is dry and heated, leading to fear and convulsions with involuntary eye movements and excessive phlegm, one should use the Six-Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water and generate liver blood, along with the Four Gentlemen Decoction plus peony to support the spleen&#39;s earth and generate lung metal.</p>
<p>If lung metal is overpowering liver wood, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used to strengthen spleen earth, along with peony and sand to balance lung metal. Should one frequently take purgative and anti-epileptic medications while having a cold deficiency in the spleen and stomach, one must use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen and stomach, along with sand and cloves to bolster yang qi. If the spleen earth is deficient and cold kidney water encroaches on it, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor appetite, the Beneficial Yellow Powder should be used to strengthen spleen earth while dispelling cold water, thereby hopefully preventing chronic seizures.</p>
<p>Treatment should be based on a careful examination of deficiency and excess. Symptoms indicating excess relate to pathogenic qi, while those indicating deficiency involve original qi. Thus, what is in excess should be regarded as deficient.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Excitement and Chronic Excitement</strong></p>
<p>Sudden excitement frequently occurs and frequently requires treatment. When using purgative medicines in excess, it depletes the spleen and consumes the yin, transforming it into chronic excitement. One should primarily tonify the spleen and nourish the blood, supplemented with calming agents to clear the lungs and regulate the liver. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The prior symptoms often arise from vomiting and purging, leading to weakness in the spleen and stomach, with the liver wood overpowering them, or due to the kidney water counteracting the earth. Thus, it appears to convulse without truly convulsing, and one may first use the Diaoteng Decoction. If the spasms lessen slightly, then use the Baojian Tianma Powder. If there are vomiting and lack of appetite, urgently apply the Muxiang Yigong Powder to strengthen the spleen and earth, and the illness will resolve. If it does not respond, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additional Muxiang and toasted ginger to warm and tonify the spleen. If there is still no response, urgently add Fuzi to revive the yang. </p>
<p>Chronic excitement symptoms are characterized by external heat and internal true cold; there is no wind to dispel, no phlegm to expel, but one must prioritize warming and tonifying the spleen and stomach. Generally, convulsions caused by wind exhibit a bluish face, red complexion, and cries of distress; if due to fright, there are shouts and convulsions; if caused by food, there is belching, vomiting, and feelings of oppression. Weakness in the lungs and spleen produces sticky phlegm, causing a sawing sound in the throat. This occurs because the heart fire cannot settle the spleen earth, and the spleen earth cannot support the lung metal, leading to the lungs being unable to control qi and the spleen unable to retain saliva, thus causing saliva and gas to rise. </p>
<p>If one uses medicines to dispel wind, transform phlegm, and regulate qi, it will scatter the qi, deplete the yin, and hasten the danger.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Shock and Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>In cases of a child experiencing shock and convulsions, there must be phlegm involved, either due to shock causing phlegm accumulation or due to phlegm leading to shock. In ancient methods for treating shock, phlegm-relieving medicines are always included; it is essential to address the phlegm first before resolving heat and calming the spirit. If phlegm obstructs the chest and diaphragm, then remedies for clearing heat and calming the spirit will have no effect. For heavy phlegm, use Erchen Decoction with bamboo juice and a small amount of ginger juice for the best stability. For heavy phlegm, use Rolling Phlegm Pills or Bai Bingzi for relieving shock to expel it. Rolling Phlegm Pills eliminate heat phlegm, while Bai Bingzi and the Relieving Shock Pills help expel phlegm accumulation. If phlegm is obstructing the upper body, it should be expelled; if severe, use medication to induce vomiting; if mild, self-induced vomiting may suffice. If vomiting is not necessary, focus on Erchen Decoction as the primary remedy. For cases of spleen deficiency with heat phlegm, add Baizhu, Qinjian, and Lian; for phlegm due to wind, add Nanshing, Beimu, and Zhisun; for stomach deficiency causing phlegm, add Baizhu, malt, and bamboo juice.<br><strong>Note:</strong> If the previous symptoms are due to the heart and liver meridians with excessive wind-heat, showing symptoms like tightly closed eyes and limb convulsions, the liver should be treated to clear the heart. If due to heat retention in the heart meridian, with shouting and trembling, it is advisable to clear heat and calm the spirit. If caused by lung wind-cold invasion, with symptoms like shortness of breath and wheezing, treat phlegm and regulate the lungs. If due to dietary disturbances with vomiting and drowsiness, digestion and strengthening the spleen should be the focus.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the weakness of the spleen and lungs leads to an abundance of wind and phlegm, resulting in the previous symptoms, the main approach should be to tonify the middle and enhance the qi. If one insists on using medications to dispel wind, treat phlegm, or regulate qi, then the qi will disperse, the yin will diminish, and this will hasten the danger.</p>
<p>If a child suddenly shows signs of shock, with upward gaze, head shaking, and teeth grinding, the symptoms appear strange. Many in society attribute this to an excess of the liver&#39;s meridian and administer calming medications. However, could it not also be due to dietary stagnation, accumulation of phlegm, and excessive fluids, which resemble shock symptoms? It is essential to investigate whether there are any blockages causing abdominal pain and chest fullness, and if there is vomiting and aversion to food. If mild, one can resolve stagnation and transform phlegm; if severe, one should induce vomiting to remove the accumulated stagnation before proceeding with treatment.</p>
<p>There are also cases where fever arises from a cold combined with vomiting and diarrhea, where the deficiency of qi and blood is forced into a state of heat. Although signs of shock are observed, one should not immediately administer calming medications but instead treat the vomiting, diarrhea, and cold. This will stabilize the qi, reduce the heat, and eliminate the shock.</p>
<p>(Note: If the prior symptoms are due to the liver&#39;s wood overwhelming the spleen&#39;s earth, one can use Six Gentlemen Decoction with peony, agarwood, and bupleurum. If due to the spleen’s deficiency, one should use the Five-Flavored Unique Efficacy Powder. In general, stagnation of food and piling up of phlegm leading to shock symptoms result from the weakness of the spleen&#39;s earth, which cannot transform and transport. Thus, by strengthening the spleen and stomach, food will naturally digest, and phlegm will disperse. If calming or wind-dispelling medications are used lightly, they may actually exacerbate the wind and worsen the condition. Moreover, how could tender and delicate organs endure harsh medications? To treat only the symptoms would be a mistake.)<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medication for children should not be harsh or severe.</p>
<p>The medicines for children&#39;s convulsions are usually small pills or powders, often harsh and severe, chosen for their high efficacy. While effective for conditions related to excess in the liver and heart, they should not be used continuously, especially for moderate illnesses, where one should promptly stop. For mild conditions, it is advisable to use gentle doses; when the illness improves, one should focus on harmonizing and regulating. </p>
<p>For instance, medicines like Niuhuang Wan contain many ingredients, often chaotic and excessive. Liangjing Wan should not be given unless there is strong liver fire. Baolong Wan frequently shows little effect; moreover, its ingredients like musk and borneol are too pungent, dispersing true vital energy and damaging the spleen and stomach, leading to a deficiency of original qi, which may cause the illness to worsen.</p>
<p>[Note: In pediatric conditions, &quot;excess&quot; pertains to the liver channel, while &quot;deficiency&quot; relates to the spleen channel. Excess refers to pathogenic qi, while deficiency refers to original qi. In cases of excess pathogenic qi and deficiency of original qi, one should supplement rather than purge, especially since delicate organs in children cannot tolerate harsh medicines.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After being startled, the eyes move slightly and the teeth clench. This indicates liver deficiency, with deficiency accompanied by heat. The deficiency suggests insufficient blood, while the heat indicates excess energy. When water is insufficient, it cannot contain fire, causing it to flare up. The gums belong to the stomach and spleen; when the stomach is deficient and there is heat, slight clenching can also be observed. One should not attribute this solely to liver and kidney issues but should focus on nourishing the spleen, adding Huang Lian, Shao Yao, and Chuan Xiong to drain liver qi and nourish liver blood. Sheng Di Huang cools the heart’s blood, thus the Dao Chi San should be used. Shu Di Huang nourishes kidney blood, hence the Di Huang Wan is appropriate. For any cases of liver and kidney deficiency, one can add Di Huang to spleen and stomach remedies. If one attributes eye clenching and teeth grinding solely to liver and kidney deficiency and exclusively takes Di Huang Wan, won&#39;t that just lead to phlegm accumulation, obstructing the spleen and stomach?</p>
<p>(Note: It’s noted that previous symptoms may also indicate liver heat generating wind that enters the eyes; this can cause them to strain and become tense under heat. If the face is flushed while lying down, shaking the head, and grinding the teeth, this is caused by heart heat. One must also differentiate between deficiency and excess: if the liver is in excess, use Qing Wan; if deficient, use Di Huang Wan; if the heart is in excess, use Dao Chi San; if deficient, use Fen Hong Wan. If the spleen and stomach are deficient with heat, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Shao Yao and San Zhi to stabilize the spleen earth and control the liver wood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I respectfully suggest that symptoms such as blackened eyelids, cold ears, clenched teeth, and diarrhea indicate a deficiency of the spleen’s earth element, with cold water retaliating against and oppressing the earth, leading to adverse conditions related to the kidneys. To treat this, one should use Baixiang Wan to purge it, and urgently apply the Four Gentlemen, clove, dried tangerine peel, magnolia, thick-skinned and roasted ginger to warm and nourish the spleen’s earth. When the body feels hot, drinking water may cause the blackened symptoms to recur, making recovery difficult. This occurs because of the spleen’s deficiency, and cold water invading it. Thus, Mr. Chen Wenxiu says: if one treats cold water after it has invaded, why not protect the spleen’s earth before it becomes deficient? This reveals what was not previously acknowledged, saving future generations from error. Moreover, when smallpox erupts, forming pus and scars, it indicates the emergence of boils, decaying and regenerating flesh, all resulting from the spleen’s original qi. If one has blackened symptoms, chills, clenched teeth, diarrhea, and breathing issues, this indicates the yang qi of the boils has been lost and cold qi has invaded, representing a yin condition. One should urgently use Yigong Powder, increasing the amounts of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, ginger, and ashwagandha to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach. One must not be rigid in timing for detoxification and purging methods. Instead, when weakness appears, it is appropriate to nourish the spleen and stomach to recover the scars. Observing how Mr. Danxi treated an elderly man with fever and fatigue, whose pulse was large and somewhat rapid, he treated him with twenty doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, and major ingredients of dried tangerine peel, leading to the emergence of smallpox; after another twenty doses, the pustules formed, with skin remaining intact; and after sixty doses, he stabilized, revealing the principle behind the treatment.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

<p>Children may experience shock or convulsions, may have changes in their conditions, suffer from food accumulation, or experience alternating cold and heat. If they mistakenly take medicines that relieve exterior conditions or clear heat, it can damage the spleen and stomach, making it difficult to generate qi and blood. This leads to a pale complexion, emaciated body, trembling eyes, grinding teeth, thin hair, weak limbs, and an inability to walk. This condition results from spleen deficiency, not liver or kidney issues. It requires gradual nurturing and regulation to restore the stomach&#39;s qi.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Medicinal substances that are overly potent are not suitable for the spleen and stomach, especially in children. Many ailments arise from improper dairy and food intake, imbalances in cold and warmth, which weaken the spleen and stomach, disrupting the foundation of vital energy, allowing pathogens to invade. Some issues may also stem from the nurse&#39;s physiological imbalances or emotional distress, as well as irregularities in diet and lifestyle. If one does not discern the fundamental causes and the urgency of the condition but mistakenly administers harsh medicines, severely harming the life-giving qi of the spleen and stomach, it can lead to various transformations of the disease and hasten death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Summary of Caring for Infants</strong><br><strong>By Xue Kai (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liver</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang says: The liver governs wind. When it is in excess, there will be shouting with wide eyes, a stiff neck, and sudden oppression; when it is deficient, there will be teeth grinding and yawning. When heat rises, it causes exterior wind; when the air is warm, it generates internal wind, which can be dispersed with Da Qing Gao powder. If the patient can eat, continue to drink water, and use Da Huang Wan to induce slight purging. If the liver is heated, the eyes won’t twitch, and the hands will seek the collar or fidget with objects. Use Xie Qing Wan to treat it. High heat calls for water to relieve wheezing and suffocation, treated with Xie Bai San. Liver conditions manifest in fall; if the lung is weak and unable to overcome the liver, use Yi Huang San to tonify the spleen and Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver. If wind affects the liver, the eyes will blink repeatedly, and if the heart is hot, there will be twitching; treat the liver with Xie Qing Wan and the heart with Dao Chi San. In severe cases, the body may arch backward, the eyes will not twitch, and the heart won’t bear heat; use Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys and Xie Qing Wan for the liver. Those with pale lips should not be treated. Zhang Jiegu also states: The liver governs wind—when afflicted, there will be wind twitching and tightness. If the heart takes advantage of the liver due to excess, the lung takes advantage as a thief, and the kidney takes advantage as a deficiency. Whenever the liver is sick, one must first examine the lungs and kidneys; the kidneys are the mother of the liver, and the lungs are the thief of the liver. Therefore, if the liver is ill, if it is not due to kidney water failing to support it, it is likely due to the lung metal’s ghostly influence. Thus, if the cause lies in the lungs, first treat the lungs to expel the ghost. If the cause is in the kidneys, first nourish the kidneys to rejuvenate the source. Then carefully assess the condition of the main organ regarding deficiency and excess, cold and warmth.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I suspect that if the previous symptoms indicate true heat in the liver channel with external wind, it is appropriate to use Da Qing Gao San. If, after taking the medicine, the previous symptoms persist or worsen, this indicates that the evil qi has departed but the spleen energy is deficient; it is advisable to use Yi Gong San with added Chuanxiong and Angelica. If there is虚 heat in the liver channel, possibly arising from internal wind due to repression, one should use Yi Gong San combined with Di Huang Wan to nourish. If the wind evil enters the organs, causing difficulties in eating and drinking cold items, along with constipation, this indicates that the evil qi is an internal excess; it is appropriate to use Da Huang Wan to purge it. If, after purging, one has little appetite for food and soup, or experiences abdominal bloating, this signifies internal deficiency of the spleen; it is advisable to use Bai Zhu San for nourishment. If the qi and blood are inherently weak, perhaps due to a previous illness or the use of purgative treatments, and there are signs like hand fumbling with collars, grinding teeth, yawning, and pale bluish eyes, this indicates severe deficiency of the liver channel; urgently use Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys and liver. Symptoms like difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, and irregular breathing indicate severe deficiency in the lung channel; swiftly use Yi Gong San to nourish the spleen and lungs. If, during the late afternoon hours (Shen and You), there are cries, fixed gazes, excessive yawning, restlessness, rapid heartbeat, and hand and foot tremors with fever and thirst, this indicates a clash of wind and fire overcoming the lung metal; use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to treat liver fire and promote liver blood, along with Yi Gong San to nourish the spleen soil to generate lung metal. If the lips appear pale, this indicates critical deficiency of the spleen with no cure. The ailments of infants and young children often arise from the heavy flavors and emotions during pregnancy, or from improper breastfeeding, or from the dietary distress and anger of the nursing mother. When the pathogenic qi manifests and the child’s energy is already weak, one should investigate the causes and use medicine, adding Liu Lu to treat the mother, while the child takes one or two spoonfuls.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heart</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: The heart governs fright; in truth, it manifests as crying and heat, with convulsions after drinking water. When deficient, it leads to fatigue and a restless state. He also mentions: When there is heat, the breath in sleep is warm, and there may be teeth grinding with a sense of cold while lying face up, indicating heart heat, which can be treated with Daohong San. If one lies on their back, it indicates a full-heartedness, where the energy cannot circulate up and down; in this case, Xiexin San should be used. Heart issues seen in winter indicate fire dominating water, therefore one should tonify the kidney and treat the heart. In mild cases, the ailment may resolve on its own. If there is a descent without speech, this signifies kidney deficiency and fear. Zhang Jiego further states: The heart governs heat; if the lung invades the heart it is a minor pathogen, if the liver invades the heart it is a deficiency pathogen, if the spleen invades the heart it is a real pathogen, and if the kidney invades the heart it is a treacherous pathogen. Whenever the heart is afflicted, one must first consider the liver and kidneys. When liver energy flows freely, heart energy harmonizes; when liver energy is stagnant, heart energy becomes deficient. Hence for heart issues, one should first seek the liver to clear its source.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the internal organs are afflicted, the disease will inevitably affect the organ that is conquered. The evil affecting the kidneys will inevitably transmit to the heart; thus, one must first treat the kidneys and eliminate the evil. If the pulses of the liver and kidneys are harmonious, then one should assess the heart&#39;s condition, whether it is deficient or excess, and treat accordingly. I believe those who lie on their backs do so because their chest is full of heat, hence they prefer to face upwards and seek emptiness. Those who lie on their sides do so because their chest is deficient and heated, thus they prefer to lie in a contracted position and seek fullness. In cases of fullness, one should harmonize and treat the heart and liver; in cases of deficiency, one should tonify the spleen and lungs, distinguishing between the two and observing their respective conditions. Symptoms such as jaw clenching may exhibit similarities and do not require rigid adherence. For example, even if the evil is expelled using remedies such as Xie Xin and Dao Chi, the disease may still persist, necessitating the tonification of the original qi; or it may worsen, requiring urgent warming and tonification of the original qi. If the heart qi appears in winter, during the hours of the Pig or Rat, the illness can worsen or present as silent descent, indicating deficiency of kidney water and excess heat of the heart, thus one should use Di Huang Wan. Infants with breast milk must have their mothers take this remedy.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

<p>During the hours of Yin and Mao (1-3 am) and Chen (7-9 am), spasms with fever occur, accompanied by thirst and a desire for cold drinks, leading to constipation. This is attributed to deficiency heat in the liver and gallbladder meridians, and should be treated with Chai Shao Shen Ling San. If there is thirst with a tendency to drink, spontaneous sweating, and night sweats, this indicates blood deficiency in the liver and gallbladder meridians, and can be treated with Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>If there is salivation and a sticky mouth, this indicates the liver wood overpowering the spleen earth, and can be treated with Liu Jun Zi Tang. </p>
<p>During the hours of Si, Wu, and Wei (9 am - 3 pm), if there are spasms along with thirst for water, this indicates a battle between wind and fire. In this case, Di Huang Wan can be used to tonify the liver, while Dao Chi San and Liang Jing Wan can treat the heart. If the thirst is for soup, accompanied by fatigue and a lack of milk, this indicates earth deficiency and wood excess, and Di Huang Wan should be used to tonify the kidneys, along with Liu Jun Zi to strengthen the spleen. </p>
<p>During the hours of Shen, You, and Xu (3-9 pm), if there are mild spasms with shortness of breath, slight eye deviation, a feeling of heating while sleeping with eyes exposed, and light yellow stools, this indicates deficiency heat in the spleen and lungs, and can be treated with Yi Gong San. </p>
<p>If the hands and feet are cold, or if the patient has shortness of breath and diarrhea without appetite, this indicates deficiency cold in the spleen and lungs, and can be treated with Liu Jun Zi, Pao Jiang, and Mu Xiang.

It can also result from fright during pregnancy. If the eyes are straight and drawn, the mouth is locked with saliva flowing, the belly is distended and hands twitch, the back is arched, the spine is stiff, and the body appears as if dead, remaining unconscious all day, this is called &quot;apoplexy&quot;. If the face is flushed, the eyes bulge, the tongue is out and lips bitten, the heart is restless and breath short, and the voice resembles that of a sheep, this is called &quot;heart seizure&quot;. If the face is green, lips are blue, eyes roll upward, hands and feet convulse and bend backwards, and the voice resembles that of a dog, this is called &quot;liver seizure&quot;. If the face is dark, eyes tremble, saliva is foamed, the body appears like a corpse, and the voice resembles that of a pig, this is called &quot;kidney seizure&quot;.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Shock</strong></p>
<p>Sudden shock is a Yang condition, where all the internal organs are affected and associated with heat, leading to excess of Shaoyang fire. The classic text states: when there is heat, it generates wind; wind generates phlegm. When phlegm heat resides in the heart and diaphragm, it causes a clash between wind and fire, resulting in convulsions. The text describes that excessive wood leads to this phenomenon, and its movements manifest as dizziness and sudden illness. </p>
<p>It is advisable to use medications such as Lijing Pills, Daohong Powder, and Qingxiao Pills, along with calming agents to stop the convulsions and stabilize the spirit. Lou Quanshan also states: sudden shock belongs to wood, fire, and solid earth. When wood is in excess, it leads to convulsions that are vigorous, along with upward eye movements and frequent blinking; when earth is solid, it results in body heat and a red face without vomiting or diarrhea, often leading to drowsiness and eyes closed. </p>
<p>The treatment principle should be to cool and drain, using calming shock and Lijing pills. Some may experience shock due to tight jaw, severe heat with salivation, unnatural gaze, convulsions, and trembling lips, marked by rapid and tense pulse, red cheeks and lips, with constipation. This indicates internal heat with external wind evil, requiring interruption of wind and stabilization of convulsions. If phlegm heat persists, it should still be lightly purged. After the phlegm heat is drained, it’s urgent to nourish the stomach qi; if convulsions stabilize and phlegm heat decreases, then one should supplement the spleen qi. Dongyuan notes: if the shock comes from external stimuli, Huanglian Anshen Pills are recommended; if the shock is initiated by emotional disturbance, calming pills like Anshen Zhengjing Pills are appropriate, while avoiding Fangfeng Pills. If shock leads to greenish diarrhea, Zhusha Pills are suitable, while cooling shock pills should be avoided.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Indeed, those who are suddenly startled have an excess of wind and wood. The wind and wood are associated with the liver; when they are abundant, they must transmit their effects to the spleen. To treat the liver, one must first tonify the spleen, and then drain the excess wind and wood. If one uses Yao Huang San, it would be a mistake. The classics say: when pathogenic Qi is strong, it is full; when the righteous Qi is depleted, it is vacuous. The fullness mentioned earlier refers to an excess of pathogenic Qi while the form (or vitality) is lacking. Hence, one should first drain and then tonify. If there is severe vacuity, one should prioritize tonifying the spleen, using mild herbs to attack the pathogens. The vacuity referred to here means both pathogenic Qi and vitality are insufficient, and thus one should focus on purely tonifying the true Qi.</p>
<p>If wind and fire conflict in the liver, causing twitching or eye movement and an excess of phlegm, one should use Si Wu Tang to nourish liver blood, adding Diaoteng and Shan Zhi to clear liver fire, and additionally use Si Jun Zi to tonify the spleen, and Liu Wei Wan to nourish the kidneys. If the lung metal overcomes wood and there are signs of yawning, use Xie Bai San to drain lung pathogens and Di Huang Wan to enrich liver blood. If the pathogen enters the liver, one can use Chai Hu Qing Gan San with added Long Dan Cao. If it enters the heart, use Zhi Zi Qing Gan San with added fried Huang Lian. If it enters the kidneys, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If it enters the lungs, use Di Gu Pi San. If it enters the spleen, use Liu Jun Zi with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi added. This condition is associated with liver and gallbladder blood deficiency, where wind and fire are in conflict, and change is often observed. </p>
<p>If one does not nourish liver blood and does not tonify spleen Qi, but only uses herbs to expel wind and transform phlegm, the spleen will become more vacuous, blood will be further depleted, and the pathogenic Qi will linger, inevitably leading to chronic distress.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Slow Shock</strong></p>
<p>Slow shock refers to a condition involving yin, where both the internal organs are affected by illness leading to deficiency. Due to vomiting and diarrhea, both the spleen and lungs are deficient, allowing the liver&#39;s wood element to invade, resulting in symptoms like spasms and convulsions. As Lou Quanshan stated, &quot;When wood is deficient, there are spasms and weakness,&quot; and the classics say, &quot;When wood is insufficient, it indicates imbalance.&quot; The symptom of head shaking corresponds to this. [Referring to spasms of the hands and feet, diarrhea, and palpitations.] When fire is deficient, the body feels cold and there is a cool sensation in the mouth; when earth is deficient, there is vomiting and diarrhea, and the eyes remain open during sleep. Treatment should focus on warming and nourishing the spleen and stomach, using formulas such as Six Gentlemen Decoction and Five Flavor Unique Function Powder. Xu Yongcheng notes: &quot;Wood belongs to yin, and thus liver diseases are slow and difficult to treat. Additionally, if there are mixed heat, food accumulation, and phlegm, resembling exterior patterns, one should adhere to the prescriptions of the Qian family.&quot; The &quot;Baoying Ji&quot; states: &quot;If acute shock frequently occurs and laxatives are repeatedly used, the yin of the spleen will further deplete, transforming into slow shock.&quot; Generally, symptoms include vomiting, phlegm sounds, wheezing, eyes open with a languid spirit, drowsiness with eyes exposed, spasms and convulsions, sudden onset then calm, possibly fluctuating body temperature, pale complexion, or bluish-red lips and eyebrows. The pulse tends to be slow, deep, and weak. The primary treatment should warm and nourish the spleen qi, supplemented by calming and restraining the liver. Dongyuan also states: &quot;Slow shock wind arises from the deficiency of the spleen and stomach.&quot;<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those with a deficiency of the spleen are affected by fire evils that invade its domain. When fire is strong, it can solidify the wood, and when wood is thriving, it attacks the earth. Therefore, in the heart&#39;s center, one should use sweet and warm substances to nourish the source of the earth, while also using sweet and cold remedies to reduce the fire in the spleen and supplement metal with sour and cool elements, leading to a situation where metal thrives and fire diminishes in the spleen, rendering the wind and wood weak. This condition often arises from inadequate constitution, prolonged illness of spleen deficiency, or the frequent use of harmful medications. </p>
<p>If the deficiency of the earth prevents the generation of metal, and metal cannot stabilize wood, causing wood to dishonor the earth, one should use a formula with five distinct flavors and add Angelica and sour jujube seed, complemented by a decoction of Uncaria to nourish the earth and stabilize the wood. If there is cold and deficiency in the spleen, one should administer the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger and cardamom; if that does not work, urgently add Aconite to restore yang energy. </p>
<p>It is important to note that yin blood originates from the earth of the spleen, thus the Four Gentlemen Decoction combined with Angelica and sour jujube seed is suitable. If the primal energy is depleted and leads to confusion, one should promptly moxibust the Baihui point. If one waits until phlegm is persistent before applying moxibustion, the primal energy may disperse beyond recovery. </p>
<p>This reflects the extreme transformation of the internal organs, ultimately leading to deficiency, with the spleen being primarily affected. There is no wind to chase away, nor is there fright that can be treated. The spleen&#39;s inability to control saliva results in the fluid becoming capricious and resembling phlegm; one should follow the previous methods to treat it effectively. If the underlying cause is not addressed and indiscriminate usage of remedies to eliminate wind and resolve phlegm is applied, the spleen&#39;s energy will be further harmed, yin blood will be increasingly depleted, and the pathogenic factors will escalate, resulting in greater danger.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

If there is liver deficiency leading to wind, the eyes will not be wide open or rigid, and there may be frequent jaw clenching. If there is an excess of wind in the liver channels, the eyes will be wide open, accompanied by loud cries, yawning, a tense neck, and feelings of oppression. If there is heat in the liver channels, the eyes may be wide open and not rigid, but rigidity can arise from internal heat or external heat, and warmth may manifest internally. Symptoms include reaching for clothes or fidgeting with objects. In this case, it is advisable to use Xieqing Pills. For intense heat causing coughing and tightness, Xie Bai Powder is recommended. Regardless of whether the illness is new or longstanding, it can provoke liver wind. When wind moves internally, it rises to the eyes, causing them to become wide open; if heat affects the eyes and pulls the tendons and veins, both corners of the eyes become tight, preventing them from turning, hence the rigidity of the eyes.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also cases where food stagnation in the middle burner leads to the failure of clear yang to rise and turbid yin to descend, causing the energy of the liver wood to be unable to ascend, which results in the appearance of ineffective wind. This must be examined carefully. If there is fullness in the chest and pain in the abdomen, along with vomiting and aversion to food, mild cases should be treated with methods to digest and resolve phlegm, while severe cases require exploration and purging of stagnant accumulation. One must also investigate whether the cause is due to cold or hot substances. There are instances of catching a cold leading to vomiting and diarrhea, which causes earth to weaken and wood to insult, resulting in ineffective wind. One should not hastily use calming medications but should instead opt for the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Peony, Wood Fragrance, and Bupleurum to nourish the liver and tonify the spleen. If the condition is due to deficiency of the spleen and resulting illness, Five Flavors Decoction should be used. In cases of food stagnation and the presence of phlegm and dampness leading to symptoms of agitation, it is truly due to the weakness of the spleen-earth, which fails to generate metal. If metal is deficient, it cannot pacify wood, and thus wood is allowed to go awry. It is advisable to strengthen the spleen and digest food, and the symptoms will resolve on their own. If one rashly uses medications for agitation, it may worsen the wind and exacerbate the condition. Moreover, since the internal organs are delicate, harsh treatments should not be administered; practitioners should be cautious!<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Disturbance During Sleep</strong></p>
<p>When a child is startled awake in their sleep, it is due to a deficiency in the heart and kidneys. The heart governs blood and spirit, the liver stores blood and the soul, the lungs govern qi and the corporeal soul, and the kidneys govern essence and fear. Children’s organs are fragile and easily disturbed by fright; fear causes qi to descend, and surprise leaves the heart without support and the spirit without a home. The spirit and qi of a person move through the eyes when awake and reside in the kidneys when asleep. If both the heart and kidneys are deficient, they cannot stabilize the spirit, resulting in disturbances during sleep. </p>
<p>Treatment should focus on calming the heart and tranquilizing the spirit, using a formula of Poria heart-replenishing soup, adding sour jujube seed, Poria, and Five Flavor Fruit. In cases where fright causes disturbance due to liver agitation, the soul is unsettled, and treatment should aim to calm fright and stabilize the soul, using tranquilizing pills. If food is interrupted by fright, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Spirit Qu to promote digestion and Hou Po to regulate. If food is digested but fright is still unsettled, use the Poria heart-replenishing soup. If excessive wood and fire make the heart spirit uneasy, use Guide Red Powder. If wind and heat collide, use Chai Hu and Gardenia Powder. If food stagnation produces phlegm and causes unrest, use the Four Gentlemen to strengthen the spleen, Spirit Qu and Ban Xia to transform phlegm, and Gardenia and Peony to clear heat.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heavenly Fishing: Internal Fishing</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly fishing refers to a condition where the child looks up in fear, experiencing shock and heat, with eyes bulging and tears welling but not flowing. The limbs twitch, alternating between sorrow and laughter, as if possessed by a ghost. In severe cases, the fingernails may turn blue, caused by the wet and rich diet of the wet nurse, which accumulates toxins in the stomach, leading to heat and phlegm in the child&#39;s heart and lungs. Additionally, external cold evils may also be a problem. The remedy should focus on expelling these evils, using a decoction made from vine (Diao Teng). For those who exhibit coarse breathing, administer the Four Gentleman Decoction with scorpion (Wu Xie).</p>
<p>Internal fishing is characterized by abdominal pain accompanied by shortness of breath, lips turning dark, and bulging cysts. The child may also be hunched over with eyes turned red at the corners, likely due to wind during pregnancy or an external fright. If the internal organs are seizing and causing painful cries, or if there are diarrhea and curled-up legs, both internal and external symptoms will manifest, making treatment very difficult. For internal conditions, use Jubaodan; for external indications, administer the Diao Teng decoction. If breastfeeding, the child may be treated. For abdominal pain with dark lips and cysts, use Jubaodan. For cases of external fright and internal organ spasms, use Diao Teng decoction. If the wet nurse&#39;s excessive consumption of rich food has built up toxins in the stomach, use a modified Clear Stomach Powder. If the nurse’s anger has accumulated heat in the liver, use modified Xiao Yao San or modified Gui Pi Decoction, both with added reed. Both mother and child should take these remedies.</p>

<p>Shock from wind is characterized by a sense of fear, confusion, and a disbanded spirit. Phlegm and saliva come and go, manifesting as a blue complexion and diarrhea. If the shock penetrates the heart, it leads to a red face and night crying; treat with Gardenia powder to clear the liver, combined with Coptis. If it enters the liver, a greenish face and bulging eyes occur; use Chai Hu powder to clear the liver. If it impacts the spleen, it results in a yellow face, vomiting,虚 (exhaustion), and a tendency to sleep; use Six Gentlemen plus Chai Hu and Mountain Gardenia.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nosebleeds from Shaking One&#39;s Head</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: All dizziness caused by winds pertains to the wood of the liver. When wood is influenced by wind, it moves, indicating that the fire in the liver channel is strong, giving rise to deficient wind. The physician Tang treated Zheng Du&#39;s assistant, who had been experiencing nosebleeds from shaking his head for seven years, using medicines to dispel wind and stop bleeding, but all trials proved ineffective. This condition was due to wind-heat affecting the liver channel, where the earth is overwhelmed by the wood, failing to contain the blood, which then spills into the large intestine, resulting in persistent nosebleeds. Thus, a formula was devised: Clear the Liver and Nourish the Stomach Decoction, to soothe the liver and benefit the spleen, dispel wind-heat, and concurrently take the Stomach Wind Decoction. After ten days, all symptoms were resolved. The nosebleeds occur because the shaking wind wood disrupts the earth, preventing it from controlling the blood. Overindulgence in sour flavors, believed to nourish the liver, leads to the formation of yin constraints. The classics say: When yin is constrained, it results in blood loss—one liter at first, then two liters in the second constraint, and three liters in the third.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

Sometimes, the spirit is calm while the body seeks clothing, or the symptoms are severe and the spirit is dulled with difficulty breathing; medicine cannot be swallowed, and there is no sneezing. If there is sudden intense heat and pain in the heart, along with loud cries, it is untreatable. </p>
<p>In cases of gradual fright, the limbs are cold, there may be vomiting, diarrhea, or coughing. The face becomes dark and the spirit grim, there is pain in the stomach, and both conditions result in agitation.

<p>When a child has heat, excessive heat produces phlegm, which leads to fright; excessive fright causes convulsions, and vigorous convulsions result in a tight and urgent jaw, thus producing the eight symptoms. These are convulsions, spasms, pulls, tremors, retraction, stretching, darting, and focused gaze. Convulsions involve the hands stretching and contracting, while spasms refer to the fingers opening and closing. Pulling resembles wrestling, tremors cause the head to tilt awkwardly, retraction results in the body leaning backward, stretching has arms like drawn bows, darting has eyes wide with anger, and focused gaze shows lifeless eyes. These are known as the eight symptoms. The four conditions here refer to frightful wind due to phlegm heat.

<p><strong>Sudden Fright</strong></p>
<p>Sudden fright is a yang condition, where the internal organs are affected, and hot phlegm obstructs the heart and lungs, indicating an excess of the lesser yang fire. The classics state that heat generates wind, which can occur from hearing loud noises. This refers to the east&#39;s Zhen hexagram, which embodies the fiery energy leading to convulsions. Fire itself does not move; it requires wind to be stirred. One should use Li Jia Pill, Dao Chi Powder, Xie Qing Pill, and Di Huang Pill. To stop the convulsions, it is advisable to take An Shen Pill.</p>
<p>If sudden fright is accompanied by heat, it can lead to the generation of wind, possibly triggered by shock. Symptoms may include tightness in the upper body, drooling, and heat in both the body and mouth; during the convulsions or upon waking, the person may appear as before, which signifies sudden fright. As the convulsions gradually lessen, one can take calming and heat-clearing herbs, like She Xiang Pill, Zhen Xin Bao Long Pill, Chen Sha Pill, and Zi Xue varieties. Once the convulsions stabilize, one should promptly use medications to eliminate the phlegm and heat, such as Li Jing Pill, Ruan Jin Dan, and Tao Zhi Pill. By effectively dispelling phlegm heat, the heart and spirit will find peace and recovery will occur.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

<p>In children, if there are unexpected twitching of the eyes, it is due to liver wind. If there is unprovoked laughter during the day, the wind is in the heart. If fingers move during dreams, the wind affects the tendons. If fearful of others, it is related to the spleen. If there are involuntary movements of limbs during dreams, the wind affects the liver and heart. If the complexion changes from red to black unexpectedly, the wind is in the kidneys. If there are unprovoked biting, it is the wind in the bones. If one grasps others unexpectedly with limbs, the wind is in the Sanjiao. If the tongue is protruded in dreams, the wind is in the heart. If there is a sensation of pulling in the throat while sleeping, the wind affects the lungs and stomach. If the complexion is pale and there are unexpected fever and shivers, the wind is in the spleen. If there are unprovoked dark facial expressions and terrible screams, the wind is in the kidneys.<br>—Collection of Medical Works, Volume 427<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Children&#39;s Convulsions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang]</p>
<p><strong>Liver</strong></p>
<p>Liver disease is characterized by crying, shouting, direct gaze, yawning, irritability, and a tight neck. When wind invades externally, it leads to irritability and a feeling of heat in the mouth, necessitating dispersion, best treated with Da Qing Gao (Great Blue Ointment). Whether the condition is acute or chronic, all involve liver wind. When the wind ascends to the head and eyes, as the eyes pertain to the liver, the wind&#39;s movement is erratic, causing the child to be unable to control their gaze, leading to a straight look. If heat enters the eyes, it pulls on the tendons and veins, causing both corners to tighten, preventing eye movement, hence the fixed gaze. If there is concurrent wind and heat, it leads to spasms, as both the mother and child have real heat that clashes together with wind and fire. </p>
<p>Jie Gu said: The liver governs strategizing and bravery. When there is heat, one seeks clothing or fiddles with objects; the fixed and straight gaze with inability to turn, or in extreme cases, rigidity of the body—these are all signs of wind and heat. The eyes are the orifice of the liver, belonging to wood, which is by nature hasty, hence the symptoms. </p>
<p><strong>Liver diseases are observed in autumn</strong> [alternative: during the late afternoon]. The liver is stronger than the lungs, and if the lungs are weak and cannot overcome the liver, one must tonify the spleen and lungs. Treating the liver by benefiting the spleen is essential because the mother (spleen) supports the child (liver).<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To tonify the spleen, use the Yi Huang Powder; to treat the liver, the Xie Qing Pill is indicated. </p>
<p>Liver diseases are seen in spring; [some say in the morning], when the lungs dominate the liver, one should tonify the kidneys and liver while treating the lungs. If the liver is timid, it suffers from illness. To replenish the liver and kidneys, use the Di Huang Pill; to treat the lungs, the Xie Bai Powder is indicated. </p>
<p>With the five organs interacting, when encountering light to severe liver diseases, in autumn, when wood (the liver) flourishes, the liver dominates the lungs, thus it is appropriate to tonify the lungs and drain the liver. In mild cases, liver disease recedes; in severe cases, lips turn pale and death occurs.</p>
<p>Loushi said: The five extremes interact; diseases follow the seasons. This is what Qian&#39;s expansion on the theory of organs and energies in the Inner Canon illustrates, revealing insights not previously articulated. If liver disease appears in spring or early morning, it indicates the liver&#39;s inherent condition. Now, if it appears in autumn or at dusk, it relates to the lungs. Knowing the lungs are severely deficient, the liver then overcomes them; thus, tonifying the spleen and lung while draining the liver is appropriate. I follow this principle.</p>
<p>Jie Gu said: The liver governs wind; when it is diseased, wind causes twitching and constriction. Quickly consume sweet foods to alleviate it, assisted by sour and bitter to disperse the wind. </p>
<p>In fact, the power of wind can be quite strong; the Xie Qing Pill is indicated for this.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is deficiency, wind causes spasms and weakness; this is treated with Dihuang Wan. </p>
<p>When the heart is affected by the liver, and there are strong邪热 (pathogenic heat), leading to spasms, it is treated with Lijing Wan or Liangjing Wan. </p>
<p>When the lung is affected by the liver, if邪气 (pathogenic qi) is rampant causing yawning and slight spasms, one should drain the lung and first tonify the root organ. For tonifying the liver, Dihuang Wan is used; for draining the lung, Xiebai San is used. </p>
<p>When the spleen is affected by the liver, with slight邪 (pathogenic influence) causing excessive sleepiness and heaviness leading to spasms, one should first stabilize the spasms, treated with Xieqing Wan. If the spasms stop, further treatment can be decided. </p>
<p>When the kidney is affected by the liver, with deficiency causing cold, yawning, and spasms, Qianghuo Gao is used.</p>
<p>Liu Shi remarks: Whenever there is liver illness, one must first examine the lung and kidney to discern the origin of the illness. After assessing the deficiency or excess of the liver&#39;s root organ, one can proceed with treatment. The kidney is the mother of the liver, and metal (lung) is the thief of wood (liver). If the liver is ill, and it is not due to the kidney water being unable to support it, it must be the lung&#39;s metal that attacks; thus, it must be carefully examined.</p>
<p>If the issue arises in the lung, treat the lung first to combat this pathogen. If it arises in the kidney, first tonify the kidney to nourish the root. Then assess the deficiency or excess of the liver and its cold or heat condition.</p>

<p>Heart</p>
<p>Heart conditions often manifest as crying, panic, trembling of the hands and feet, fever, and thirst. Jie Gu said: The heart governs heat; if the illness is due to great heat, then Xièxīn Decoction is the remedy. If it is due to excessive internal heat, then Huánglián Xièxīn Decoction should be used. If it is a deficiency causing panic, then Shēngxī San is the remedy. If the lungs invade the heart, resulting in slight evil causing wheezing and strong heat, then Xièbái San should be used. If the liver is attacking the heart, resulting in deficiency and wind-heat, then Dàqiānghuó Decoction or Dàqīng Wán should be used. If the spleen is invading the heart, causing excessive evil and heat in the body, then Xièhuáng San is the remedy. If the kidneys are invading the heart, causing fear and the spread of evil cold, then Ānshén Wán is the treatment. </p>
<p>Liu said: If the heart becomes ill, one must first regulate the liver and kidneys. The kidneys are the spirit of the heart; when liver qi is smooth, heart qi is harmonious; when liver qi is stagnant, heart qi is deficient. Thus, treat the liver first to purify its source. When the five organs are ill, the illness must first be conveyed to the organ it overcomes. Water can conquer fire, hence if the kidneys are affected, the illness will certainly transmit to the heart, so treat the kidneys first to eliminate the evil. Therefore, one should restore kidney qi and enhance liver qi with both remedies.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Palpitations</strong></p>
<p>The human body has nine organs. The heart houses the spirit, the liver houses the soul, and both organs are responsible for blood. When blood is insufficient, the spirit and soul become unsettled, resulting in palpitations. It is said: the color of the east is green, corresponding to the liver, and its disorder leads to fright. It is also stated: when two yangs and one yin cause illness, it gives rise to frights. &quot;Fright&quot; refers to the heart suddenly moving and feeling fear; &quot;palpitation&quot; refers to the heart beating rapidly and feeling startled. Both arise from a deficiency of heart qi and blood, leading to forgetfulness, treated with Si Wu and calming herbs. Dan Xi noted that if related to phlegm, use Wen Dan Tang, adding Chen Sha and Yuan Zhi. If thoughts provoke movement, it indicates deficiency; use Yang Xin Tang. If symptoms appear intermittently, it indicates phlegm; use Fu Ling Wan. If easily startled by external events, it indicates weakness and fear of the heart and gallbladder; use Wen Dan Tang. If sleepless with frequent nightmares, it indicates that blood is not returning to the source; use Zhen Zhu Mu Wan. If dreams are unrestful, it indicates the liver’s soul is unguarded; use Ding Zhi Wan. If fearful and unable to be alone, it indicates coldness in gallbladder qi; use Fu Shen Tang. If restless during sleep, it indicates excess heat in gallbladder qi; use Suan Zao Ren Wan.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Dizziness and palpitations arise from internal phlegm due to wind; use the original formula of cinnabar and polygala pills. When thoughts and worries become congested, with a deficiency in the spleen and stagnation in qi, use the Gui Pi Decoction. Although the previous symptoms are attributed to the heart and liver, the blood is actually governed by the spleen. The spleen is associated with thought; excessive thinking depletes blood and fails to nourish the liver. The heart is directed by the spleen; internal agitation of thoughts invariably engages the heart. The heart, being the organ of the sovereign fire, presides over the twelve officials. The virtue of the sovereign is to be commanding without anger and to govern without effort; thus, it should be calmed with tranquility and guarded against impulsiveness. Movement leads to the intertwining of the fire energies, exhausting the essence and blood; when essence and blood are depleted, the fire can manifest alone, giving rise to anxiety and palpitations, the fire of the five emotions that the heart cannot control. Therefore, in treating the spleen, one must understand nourishing the heart; in nourishing the heart, one must know how to calm it and desire less. Yet, who among people is without thought? Proper thought leads to freedom from desires of impulsive action. Zhuzi said: One must ensure that the way of the heart always governs the whole body, and that the human heart must always obey it. This is the essence of nourishing the heart.</p>
<p>Regarding shock, Lou Shi states: Shock and convulsions are one and the same, yet there are distinctions based on morning and evening, and surface and internal differences. Someone with great heat in their body will have acute shock, while someone with cold and weak energy will experience chronic shock. Those who fall and make sounds, or drool when waking, have epilepsy. Those who gaze upward with their heads have a condition known as &quot;tian diao&quot; (heavenly hang), and those whose limbs are arched in spasm are in convulsions, with different treatments for each condition.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Supplementing and Draining Method</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: If there is a strong liver condition due to spleen disease, the method should be to supplement the spleen, but there is a fear that the wood element might cause harm. Therefore, it is advisable to first drain the heart and liver to lessen their strength, and only then should one supplement the spleen. In cases of tidal heat and convulsions occurring during the Rat, Ox, or Pig hours, this indicates the kidneys are in action. If there are not severe convulsions but restlessness while sleeping, a strong and warm body, eyes that squint or gaze off, phlegm in the throat, dark brown stools, indigestible food, and excessive sleep leading to no awareness, one should supplement the spleen and treat the heart, as such conditions often arise from the spleen and stomach being weakened after a major illness.</p>
<p><strong>Exterior and Interior</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: Children who are born weak and timid often suffer from wind-induced convulsions. This condition arises from a cold, similar to that which adults experience with wind, cold, and phlegm; once treated, they recover. Convulsions caused by overeating refer to those that do not happen suddenly due to other issues; instead, they arise from excessive food intake damaging the spleen and stomach, resulting in children sleeping excessively and vomiting, showing no interest in food. When the spleen and stomach are weak, it can provoke liver wind, leading to convulsions. First, one should stabilize the convulsions using preparations like Qianghuo and Fangfeng decoctions to drain and expel, then use Bai Bingzi to promote digestion. As the patient’s appetite improves, use Tiaozhong Wan and Yigong San to nourish their energy. Lou Shi said: If the fear is due to external factors and the original qi is not ill, it should be treated with the bitter cold of Huanglian to calm the spirit. If the disturbance is due to internal air movement and not because of external shocks, and the original qi is indeed ill, it should be treated with the sweet cold of Shuilianshi to calm the spirit.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Sudden and Slow Shock</h3>
<p>The sudden and slow shocks experienced by children are historically referred to as yin-yang convulsions. The sudden type belongs to yang, where yang is excessive and yin is deficient; the slow type belongs to yin, where yin is excessive and yang is deficient. Yang is active and can cause agitation, while yin is calm and tends to be slow—all due to the weaknesses of the organs. Weakness can induce heat, and heat can create wind, thus wind arises from the liver, phlegm from the spleen, shock from the heart, and heat from the liver, which also affects the heart.</p>
<p>Combining shock, wind, phlegm, and heat results in four syndromes, while manifestations such as twitching, convulsing, spasms, trembling, reversal, pulling, retreating, and visual disturbances represent eight signs. Eye blinking, head shaking, mouth opening with tongue protrusion, red lips and flushed face, bluish complexion around the eyes and lips, and any bluish diarrhea, along with prominent veins on the temples, all indicate signs of convulsive shock.</p>
<p>Generally, the contention between liver wind and heart fire must involve heart heat to manifest, starting with twitching. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the condition based on deficiency and excess, first identifying the direction of symptoms before treatment, which must be addressed in the correct sequence.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In essence, real heat corresponds to acute fright, while false heat corresponds to chronic fright; chronic fright should not have heat, as any heat that appears is of a false nature. Acute fright pertains to Yang, treated with cold medicine; chronic fright pertains to Yin, treated with warm medicine. However, one must clearly understand the nuances of severity, weight, progression, retreat, speed, and slowness, thus it is said that the discussion of heat concerns the true and the false. </p>
<p>For men, twitching left looks left; for women, twitching right looks right. Men’s eyes tend to dart upwards, while women’s eyes tend to dart downwards. Men grasp the thumb and point outward, while women grasp the thumb and pull inward. Men pull straight left and curve right, while women pull straight right and curve left. All of this follows a pattern; going against it is considered the reverse. There are cases where one twitches left first and then double twitches. Yet, the correct twitching is silent, while the incorrect twitching is noisy. </p>
<p>The fingerprints that curve inward represent the correct direction, while those that curve outward represent the reverse; if the entrance and exit are half and half, recovery is difficult; thus it is stated, the distinction between reverse and correct direction lies here. Yang diseases affect Yin channels, and Yin diseases affect Yang channels, representing a reversal. In general, excessive heat produces phlegm, abundant phlegm causes fright, intense fright creates wind, and excessive wind causes twitching.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat convulsions, one must first address wind; to treat wind, one must first resolve fright; to treat fright, one must first eliminate phlegm; to treat phlegm, one must first relieve heat. If all four conditions are present, one should apply combined treatments; if one aspect is neglected, it will surely lead to other ailments. Hence, it is said that treatment has its order. This is the guiding principle. </p>
<p>If we differentiate among the three types, the acute convulsion is characterized by violent symptoms, while the heavy symptoms indicate a chronic convulsion. A severe case is linked to liver wind, where wood overcomes the spleen and earth, thus resulting in chronic spleen wind.</p>
<p>Loushi states: Acute convulsion symptoms belong to the excess of wood, fire, and earth. When wood is in excess, it causes major convulsions, with the eyes rolling upwards; the term &quot;wood excessively&quot; means it causes eruptions. Such movement leads to dizziness or seizures. When fire is excessive, there will be heat in the body and face; with excess earth, there will be no vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in a closed-eye state. Therefore, the treatment should involve cooling and purging, utilizing formulas like Cool Fright Pill and Expelling Fright Pill.</p>
<p>Chronic convulsion symptoms pertain to the deficiency of wood, fire, and earth. When wood is deficient, convulsions are slight, resembling shaking but not severe; this is described as &quot;wood insufficient,&quot; leading to an unstable condition. The patient may exhibit shaking and fear.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that the twitching of the hands and feet, as well as abdominal distress, is due to fear and palpitation of the heart. When fire is deficient, the body and breath are cold; when earth is deficient, one may experience vomiting, diarrhea, and sleep disturbances. Therefore, the treatment should focus on warming and tonifying, using Qianghuo ointment and Yihuang powder. For those with heat, one should use Dongyuan Huangqi Yihuang powder. Dongyuan’s treatment differs from Qian’s Qianghuo ointment, which addresses chronic fright; it is said that earth deficiency leads to diarrhea and the wood rising above it, indicating warmth in both the palm and abdomen. If there is deficiency of fire, wood, and earth, accompanied by shaking and anxiety, with cold hands and abdomen, only Qianghuo ointment can treat it.</p>
<p>Danxi states: There are two types of pediatric convulsions: acute convulsion is related to phlegm-heat and should be treated with cooling and purging; chronic convulsion is due to spleen deficiency, which is often fatal, and should be treated with warming and tonifying measures. For acute convulsion, one should use fire-reducing and phlegm-eliminating pills, along with blood-nourishing herbs prepared as a decoction; for chronic convulsion, the spleen should be supplemented, using Zhu Sha An Shen pills alongside clear rice soup. Additionally, one should seek remedies in blood-nourishing herbs such as Si Wu, Si Jun, and Dongyuan Huangqi Yihuang powder. The idea that a single remedy can universally treat this condition is highly misguided.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Sudden Shock</h3>
<p>The condition of sudden shock, also known as true convulsion, manifests with tightly clenched jaws, intense fever, copious saliva, and a restlessness of the eyes. There are involuntary spasms and tremors, with frequent blinking of the lips, mouth, eyebrows, and eyes. The breath in the mouth is cold, the face is flushed, and the lips are red. Excretion is yellow and red, and the pulse is floating, rapid, and forceful. This indicates an internal accumulation of heat combined with an external invasion of wind. The heart is affected by heat that accumulates and induces shock, while wind arises in the liver, triggering convulsions. The liver wind and heart fire clash between the two organs, disrupting the blood and qi, leading to an abundance of phlegm and saliva. The blood vessels become rigid and boiling, with blockages in the body&#39;s orifices. Wind qi is prevalent and has no outlet, causing violent episodes. </p>
<p>In another variation, there may be spasms and strabismus without tightly clenched jaws and no phlegm in the mouth, but with heat in the breath. One cannot immediately conclude this as a case of shock; it may instead be due to a cold or wind attack, food-related disturbances, or ailments like rash and pox. This aligns with the theory of pseudo-convulsion posited by the Qian family, with treatment tailored to the specific condition. Additionally, in cases of sudden shock with spasms, one should not try to restrain but rather support; otherwise, wind and epilepsy may invade the meridians, leading to constrained limbs and resulting in debilitation.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sudden fright arises from heat generated in the heart, leading to a warm body, flushed face, thirst, and hot breath, with yellow and red urine and stools. In severe cases, convulsions may occur; when heat is intense, wind arises, associated with the liver. This reflects a condition of excessive yang and deficient yin. Therefore, the &quot;Li Jing Wan&quot; is prescribed to dispel phlegm-heat; one must not use Ba Dou or strong purgatives, fearing the convulsions will not resolve due to excessive heat. </p>
<p>In children, heat phlegm may disturb the heart and stomach, so upon hearing a loud sound, they may be startled and convulse. Even in cases of extreme heat, they may convulse without any sound or fright. </p>
<p>Yan&#39;s theory states: When sudden fright has internal heat, it generates wind, and it may also arise from fright. Symptoms include a taut gaze, excessive salivation, and both the body and breath feeling hot; once the convulsions have subsided or they wake up, they may return to normal. This indicates a case of sudden fright. As the convulsive tendencies decrease, administer a dose or two of calming and heat-clearing herbs, such as Shexiang Wan, Zhenxin Wan, Baolong Wan, or Chenshi Wan. Once the fright has stabilized, it is essential to medicate to eliminate phlegm heat, using items like Li Jing Wan, Ruan Jin Dan, or Tao Zhi Wan, to clear phlegm heat and calm the heart and mind, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Jie Gu states: Sudden fright is a yang disorder affecting the organs. Heat phlegm lodges in the heart and lungs, which indicates thriving lesser yang fire. The scriptures say: heat generates wind, occurring from hearing a loud sound. This references the east&#39;s thunder hexagram, inspired by fire energy that induces convulsions; fire itself is immobile but moves with wind. Accordingly, one should use Li Jing Wan, Dao Chi San, Xie Qing Wan, or Di Huang Wan. Once convulsions cease, it is advisable to take tranquilizing pills.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Danji said: When startled, the wind causes a fiery sensation in the mouth and makes it difficult to speak, the hands and feet feel hot and the heart is also hot. If there is phlegm cough and phlegm asthma, one should use the method of expulsion and prepare powdered dried mulberry leaves and mulberry cowhorn in proper doses to balance the wind. [The mulberry cowhorn is the white and yellow variant compared to the poplar cowhorn.]</p>
<p>Additionally, take one tael each of northern mint leaves and cold water stone, and ten grams each of indigo, white silkworms, and cinnabar, along with two whole scorpions, and half a tael each of pig&#39;s tooth soap pod and locust pods; grind everything into powder and mix it with lampwick soup and milk for administration. When the bow is drawn back and the eyes are straight looking, due to the shock, it is advisable to use Nanxing and Banxia mixed with ginger juice and bamboo sap for administration, followed by moxibustion on Yintang.</p>
<p>For initial fright, use Fengfeng Da Chi Powder: blend equal parts of raw dried rehmannia, Sichuan pueraria, fengfeng, and licorice, and decoct with three qian of bamboo leaves. You must also prepare calming ointment: one tael each of dried lily without heart, bezoar stone, and white mustard, along with one qian of musk; grind them extremely finely, mix with refined honey, and form into small cakes. Take one cake dissolved in mint tea before sleeping, one each night.</p>
<p>Experienced doctors often say that children&#39;s fright and convulsions are mostly due to heat conditions; if you use fright medications like white attached bellflower, whole scorpions, silkworms, and Sichuan black grass first, it will lead to bad conditions. Later, if there are pediatricians, they simply use Da Chi Powder along with dried rehmannia and fengfeng for three doses to remove the evil heat obstructing the heart, and then the convulsions will stop. Following this, taking the calming ointment will produce remarkable effects.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From a young age, Sun Daorun suffered from severe convulsions. Famous pediatric specialists in Yanjing were consulted, but it only worsened his condition. His elder brother, Yu An, sought a remedy from me, which I provided in two doses, and he was immediately cured. After that, he often used this remedy to help others, and no one failed to benefit from it. Fearing that people might forget this remedy, I decided to document it.</p>
<p>Zeng said: The discourse on acute fright was not recorded in previous writings, only referred to as &quot;yang epilepsy.&quot; Generally, it occurs due to lack of care, either by being held in a draft or near a hot area, consuming too much spicy food during the day, or using excessively thick bedding at night. This leads to the accumulation of oppressive heat in the heart, which spreads to the liver. Upon being startled by people, falling, shouting, thunder, music, or the barking of dogs, any sudden fright before it manifests causes disturbances at night—either laughing or crying during sleep, grinding teeth, sweating on the forehead and nose, shortness of breath, and sudden fainting, with the eyes gazing upwards, jaws tightly clenched, and limbs convulsing. This is due to excessive heat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the face may turn red, and the pulse can be distinguished as rapid. It is evident that there is heat in the heart and wind in the liver; both organs represent the utmost of yang. The heat of the heart and the wind of the liver, corresponding to yang phenomena, when wind governs movement and heat (when fueled by wind) rises like smoke and flames. This creation of the five elements involves the two yangs clashing, with wind and fire contending. The liver stores the soul, while the heart stores the spirit. Due to heat, the spirit can easily be disturbed, resulting in fright. The heart governs the spirit; it does not remain unaffected. When startled, heat arises, leading to the wind, which can result in convulsions, termed acute fright.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of treatment begins with the use of Wuling San combined with Huangqin and licorice, decocted in water, or Baijie San to expel the wind. Next, to relieve the heart&#39;s energy, use Mutong San and Sanjie San; to smooth and cleanse the liver channel, stabilize the spirit, and reduce heat, use Niubang Tang and Fangfeng Tang as main treatments. Once the wind from fright is eliminated, for milder cases, administer Banxia Wan; for severe cases, use Shuijing Dan to eliminate phlegm, thus preventing the formation of dementia, but one must avoid using cold and cooling medicines. When heat dissipates, cold arises; excess leads to harm, hence it must be regulated. If by chance, during an emergency, both fright and wind symptoms occur, use only Wuling San with powdered cinnabar, mixed with mint decoction for relief. Wuling San contains ZeXie, which promotes urination. The heart and small intestine are interrelated; when the small intestine functions well, the heart energy is able to flow, thereby reducing fright symptoms. The presence of cinnamon in the formula allows it to restrain liver energy, thus stopping the wind. Moreover, the addition of cinnabar can calm the spirit, addressing both needs appropriately. In summary, after alleviating heat and cooling the heart and liver, it is advisable to use Pinghe Tang San for regulation; slightly warming agents are difficult to apply. Practitioners should be cautious! I often feel disheartened when witnessing others, upon seeing signs of fright, failing to distinguish between the root and branch, mistakenly treating them as one syndrome, hastily administering cold and harsh treatments such as metal, stone, musk, silkworm, scorpion, and others that search for wind, consuming vital energy and exacerbating symptoms, often leading to irreparable damage.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Little do they know that shock arises from the heart, wind from the liver, and convulsions from the qi; these are the three proofs. The nature of shock and wind has already been detailed. However, regarding the so-called buildup of qi that leads to convulsions, the arguments of the Chen family are most insightful, though they do not specify the method. In this proof, I use the Wide Qi Decoction primarily based on bitter orange peel and fruit. The essence of qi is that when the four seasons are harmonious, the body is stable; any stagnation of breath leads to illness. Moreover, young children cry intermittently; their qi becomes trapped, unable to rise and fall internally or release externally, which can also lead to convulsions at times. A good physician examines the source of the illness and treats it without fail. Further, one must discern between yin and yang, deficiency and excess, without negligence. If it is an excess of yang, boil Five Harmony Decoction and adjust with Three Resolving Powders; this addresses acute shock with convulsions. If it is a deficiency of yin, boil Firm True Decoction and adjust with Wide Qi Decoction; this addresses chronic shock with convulsions. If there is a sudden onset of this condition without distinguishing between the yin and yang deficiency or excess, first use Five Lin Powder combined with Wide Qi Decoction, adding a little warming drink; the three medicines combined, adjusted with ginger juice in boiling soup, will provide relief. Generally, the method to treat convulsions is to emphasize the importance of wide qi; when qi flows smoothly, convulsions cease, which is the principle of nature. Overall, for children, to ensure they do not frequently experience shock and anxiety, it relies on the health of the kidneys. Hence, Dai says: &quot;To treat shock, it is better to nourish the kidneys.&quot;<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that the heart belongs to fire, which is inherently dry. When it receives the energy of the liver, smoke and flames arise, leading to palpitations. Nourishing the kidneys causes water to rise and fire to diminish, preventing the invasion of pathogenic heat. Even if there is liver wind, one will not be troubled by fright. The method should be to take a dose of Rehmannia Six Formula at the hour of Shen. Alternatively, one may use Amber-Encased Dragon Pill. The reason for using the hour of Shen is that water arises during this time; when complemented with medicinal herbs, the kidney water becomes balanced, and the heart fire does not inflame, thus avoiding fright.</p>
<p>In treating with the Ling Fang method, the medications should be arranged in a sequence of priority, distinguishing between light and heavy. After unblocking the passages, one should first regulate wind and settle spasms. Once the wind and spasms are addressed, then one can treat phlegm-heat, which is the most appropriate approach. If the issue lies in phlegm-heat without any frightful wind, one can only reduce heat and transform phlegm without carelessly administering remedies for fright. This is because many medications are cold and cooling, which may draw phlegm heat into the meridians. </p>
<p>When the illness lies in heat, one should not rashly treat phlegm but should focus on expelling the external pathogens. If the issue is with fright, one should not carelessly treat wind. Fright arises from phlegm-heat; therefore, it is only necessary to reduce heat and transform phlegm to stop the fright. If phlegm is the problem, one should not hastily treat for fright but should urgently reduce heat and transform phlegm. If the issue is with wind, one should not hastily treat spasms. Wind arises from fright; thus, one should only address the fright and transform phlegm, allowing the wind to disperse. If there are spasms, one must use the methods to intercept wind and stop fright, which is the most excellent approach.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the fright is treated but the phlegm does not resolve, and the heat does not recede, how can the fright cease on its own? If the phlegm is transformed but the heat does not retreat, and the wind does not disperse, how can the phlegm be expelled? Thus, it is understood that a treatment that is not treated is, in fact, the treatment that is referred to. In cases of acute fright, if the wind has been restrained, while phlegm and heat are both released, one must urgently use remedies to harmonize the stomach and settle the heart. If the wind has been restrained but the phlegm and heat are not excessive, then using light medicine to resolve phlegm and eliminate heat is adequate. However, in cases of acute fright, though it should be treated immediately, one must not excessively use cold and cool medicines, as well as mercury, light powder, croton seeds, Glauber&#39;s salt, and the like too abruptly. If such actions are taken, they should only be done when necessary, so as to stop the illness as soon as possible. If unsuitable treatments are applied or if appropriate treatments are overused, it may lead to a chronic fright condition. Moreover, simply exhausting phlegm and heat does not require excessive measures; it suffices to carefully consider using only rhubarb. Additionally, the underlying root of acute fright lies in removing liver wind and lowering heart fire, which the early texts regard as crucial. </p>
<p>Xue stated: In cases of acute fright, symptoms include a tight jaw, intense heat with salivation, altered vision, trembling, heat in the mouth, flushed cheeks, red lips, and a rapid floating pulse. This indicates that the blood in the liver is deficient, leading to fire causing wind. When wind arises, it scatters the yin blood further; the yin fire intensifies, resulting in the depletion of lung metal and surplus in liver wood, and therefore one should nourish liver blood and support spleen qi. If one frequently consumes remedies that expel wind, transform phlegm, and clear heat, it is advisable to realize that there is a deficiency in the spleen and a loss of blood, and thus one should urgently replenish spleen energy. When phlegm and heat initially occur without fright or wind condition, one should first release the exterior, expel liver wind, and lower heart fire.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of sudden fright, it can open the meridians, and must stabilize the trembling. Various winds constrict and block the vital points, causing phlegm and saliva to accumulate, thus impeding the flow of qi. First, use Suhexiang pills, soaked in ginger juice and mixed with mint tea, to help descend the qi, which will in turn help phlegm descend, allowing the vital points to open.</p>
<p>In any case of downward treatment, one must first inquire if the previous practitioner has treated it by purging or vomiting; if the patient has been purged or vomited, do not administer additional purging. Instead, focus on expelling wind, transforming phlegm, and clearing heat. Generally, if there is a severe heat from phlegm, about two-thirds can be reduced.</p>
<p>In the downward formula, it is essential to include zhiqiao (bitter orange) and pungent herbs like changpu to ease the heart and promote the flow of qi as supportive ingredients. Acute fright must be treated immediately; delays can lead to a deeper condition. If there is confusion regarding the diagnosis, do not indiscriminately apply remedies.</p>
<p>Once the fright has been transmitted, one must cool and stabilize the wind in a sequence; if the wind has settled, there are three stages in the downward process: first a light purge, then slightly heavier, and finally an even stronger purge. After administering the treatment, harmonize the stomach and support qi; subsequently, calm the mind and settle the spirit, expel wind and quiet fright, preventing recurrence.</p>
<p>If after purging the symptoms still persist and recovery is not easily achievable, do not purge again, but rather treat it as a chronic fright and analyze it thoroughly.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are symptoms of egg-sized swelling, hernia, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, spleen distress with thirst, swelling in the limbs, constipation, and urgent lingering illnesses, then it is often a case of chronic transmission. However, if vomiting and diarrhea have led to a deficiency causing severe changes in symptoms, then the condition will worsen rapidly. Generally, if one has just experienced vomiting or diarrhea, it is considered a case of chronic shock, and one must use a warming method to support the interior. If there are sudden spasms, it indicates the initial transmission of chronic shock that still exhibits Yang symptoms; one must not mistakenly treat this as acute shock. It is often said that spasms indicate chronic shock, but this is not accurate. If one misunderstands this, they often confuse chronic spleen issues with chronic shock. For men, chronic shock mainly arises from diarrhea; for women, it arises more from vomiting. Additionally, there are five types of vomiting and five types of diarrhea, each with specific causes and treatments. As the ancients said, patients fear shock but do not fear diarrhea, while doctors fear diarrhea but do not fear shock. If diarrhea does not cease, priority should be given to treating the diarrhea. If one instead treats for wind, the shock may worsen. In case of other symptoms, the original treatment approach should be followed. For chronic shock, if it originates from acute shock, one can only balance the wind and adjust the stomach, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang. One must not solely use Yang medications, which could aggravate the condition and lead to acute shock symptoms again.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If lingering fright has transmitted into the yin, it is necessary to measure the deficiencies and excesses of yin and yang, considering the shallow and deep aspects. One must not overly use warming and drying medicines. Jie Gu said: Lingering fright is a condition where the internal organs suffer from illness, often caused by infants suffering from long-term vomiting and diarrhea, leading to spleen and stomach deficiency. If not treated early, it can develop into lingering fright, known as &quot;twitching,&quot; which resembles convulsions but is not severe. Due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, the stool does not consolidate. One should first dispel wind from the spleen, starting with Xuan Feng San to guide it out, followed by Yi Huang San and Shi Jun Zi Wan to balance it, which will naturally cease the symptoms. If treatment has been delayed, both the spleen and stomach are deficient, which allows the liver&#39;s wood element to conflict with them, leading to lingering fright. Warming tonics should be used, with Qiang Huo Gao being the main remedy. Yan Xiao Zhong compiled the Qian family&#39;s prescriptions using Yi Huang to nourish the earth, which is effective. This medicine contains clove, which is spicy and heating, promoting fire; with excessive fire, the earth becomes more deficient. Green tangerine peel drains the lung metal, while clove is spicy and heating, significantly draining the lungs and large intestine. The spleen is usually in excess and should be drained, but now with the spleen and stomach being deficient, further draining will only increase the fire and severely weaken the earth, leading to dangerous consequences.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

Chronic wind convulsions arise from prolonged diarrhea, leading to spleen and stomach deficiency. The Qian clan mistakenly uses Xianghuo ointment to treat chronic wind convulsions. Those with spleen deficiency have fire evil occupying their earth position, thus said to be a deficiency evil that arises later. When fire is strong, it can nourish wood; when wood is strong, it overcomes earth.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Slow Spleen Wind</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of Slow Spleen Wind include a pale face with sweating on the forehead, a short tongue and a lowered head, eyes that are difficult to open, shaking the head and sticking out the tongue while sleeping, frequent vomiting of foul-smelling substances, clenched teeth, and slight spasms of the hands and feet without retraction. The body may feel cold or warm while the limbs are cold, the pulse is deep and weak, Yin energy is extremely abundant, and stomach energy is greatly deficient, with a ratio of ten patients to one or two recoveries. This arises from chronic fright leading to vomiting and diarrhea, which harms the spleen; the disease has progressed to a severe stage, ultimately resulting in deficiency affecting the spleen, hence it is called Spleen Wind. If one tries to expel the wind, there is no wind to chase away; if one attempts to treat fright, there is no fright to treat. However, the phlegm and fluids in the spleen generate virtual heat fluctuating, causing the eyes to close due to the spleen being overburdened and energy being deficient, leading to a muddled spirit with stagnated phlegm. The term Slow Spleen is also referred to as Deficient Wind. After a child has vomited or had diarrhea, their complexion turns pale yellow due to deficiency and heat, often accompanied by head shaking, squinting, lethargy, sweaty forehead, and a weak voice—these are indicative of Spleen Wind. It is not necessary for all cases to originate from acute or chronic wind transmission; one should recognize this condition distinctly. Moreover, in discussing Slow Spleen symptoms, the spleen is mentioned without referring to the stomach. Why is that? It is because the stomach is part of the Yang organs, unlike the spleen which is an Yin organ. Hence, diseases affecting the Yang organs in children often self-resolve, while those affecting the Yin organs must be treated. The pure Yang energy of children flows smoothly in the Yang organs, but can become reversed in the Yin organs. Ancient practitioners focused their healing on the Yin organs, rarely mentioning the treatment of Yang organs.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The kidneys, as an organ, are primarily associated with deficiency and should not be aggressively treated. If there is an affliction of the kidneys, one should merely clear the heart and lungs, as heart and kidneys are interconnected, representing a state of mutual support. The lungs and kidneys have a child-parent relationship as well. Therefore, one should avoid medicines that directly affect the kidneys or any tonics for them. In cases of chronic spleen diseases, it is usually advisable to address issues with vomiting and diarrhea; when symptoms evolve quickly, the deficiency can also progress rapidly. Treatment must follow a gradual and harmonious approach, without seeking rapid recovery. Medicines should be balanced and moderate to harmonize the spleen and nourish the stomach, avoiding excessive dosages. </p>
<p>The Qian family has a recipe for Huangtu Decoction, which utilizes earth to overcome water; when water is balanced, the wind naturally settles, relying on the spleen&#39;s earth element. </p>
<p>The primary treatment strategy focuses on restoring the stomach&#39;s yang. If the eyes are only partially open and the hands and feet are not cold, while symptoms still exhibit slow astonishment, one should not use yang recovery methods immediately. If one suspects a chronic spleen condition but the yang energy has not severely diminished, one should refrain from using substances like sulfur or aconite; rather, if the hands and feet gradually warm up, one can use formulas like Xingspi Powder to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>The Zeng family uses Qingjindan, Tianmayan Drink, or Liuzhu Powder to stabilize true vital substances. </p>
<p>If children accidentally consume cold medicines or have their mouths wiped with water-soaked cloth, this can harm their spleen and stomach, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal distension, or gurgling sounds in the abdomen. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In childhood, if there are eye-catching symptoms, with greenish-white foam in the stool, sometimes hard and dry, and if the five symptoms emerge suddenly accompanied by vomiting, it is certain to develop into a condition called &quot;yin convulsions,&quot; commonly known as chronic fright. </p>
<p>Although the child&#39;s head is hot and the eyes are blue-white while the feet are cold, this may also be accompanied by abdominal distension with cold feet, or diarrhea with cold feet, or vomiting with cold feet, or thirst with cold feet. A hot head and red eyes, with phlegm blocking the nose and throat, indicate a source of rootless fire rising up. </p>
<p>If the five symptoms suddenly appear with vomiting and convulsions, it is referred to as &quot;chronic spleen wind.&quot; Administer a supplement to strengthen the spleen, with three qian (a measure) in one dose, increasing to include one scorpion. If the convulsion is caused by fright, give a dose of Qian Pi San—a measure of three qian—with additional half a qian each of Fu Zi and Qian Hu boiled together. </p>
<p>The above describes methods for treating chronic fright. The order of treatment forms a unique system, hence it is recorded separately for reference. Previous cases mention Xu Xu San and You Zhu Gao, which have shown consistent effectiveness.</p>
<p>For treating sudden and chronic fright:</p>
<p>Acute fright should be treated with cool purging, while chronic fright with warm tonification is the definitive method. In cases where acute cooling purging fails and transforms into chronic fright, or where chronic tonification fails and turns into acute fright, one should use the integrated medicine for both acute and chronic fright. </p>
<p>For children experiencing acute or chronic fright, with fever, oral ulcers, hot hands and feet, and phlegm heat causing cough and wheezing, the expulsion method should be employed. Strong doses should use Gua Ti San, while lighter doses can use Ku Shen and Chi Xiao Dou powder, mixed with wine and sour juices for ingestion. Afterward, use Tong Shen San in honey pill form. Between doses, mix with powdered dried mulberry cow and take to balance the qi.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Eye twitching</strong></p>
<p>The eyes are the openings of the liver. The liver and gallbladder are associated with the wind and wood meridians, and also represent the fire of the organs. The liver stores blood; when blood is insufficient, wind and fire arise internally, causing the eyes to twitch. The classics say: &quot;Bending and straightening, swaying is the sign of wind.&quot; It is advisable to use the Four Substance Decoction to nourish the blood, and Chai Hu and Shan Zhi to cleanse the liver. When the yin blood internally nourishes, the wind will naturally subside. If the condition arises from dryness of the liver&#39;s blood, one should use the Six-Flavor Pill to nourish its source. If the lung metal overcomes the liver wood, the Xie Bai Powder should be used to pacify the metal&#39;s pathogenic influence. If the eye area twitches, it indicates that liver wood is dominating spleen earth, so Bao Long Pill should be employed. If after recovery there is lingering fright and insomnia, or twitching and teeth grinding while asleep, along with eye twitching, it is due to blood deficiency failing to nourish the sinews and vessels. One should use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction with additions of Fu Ling and Wu Wei. Generally, excess indicates pathogenic qi, while deficiency indicates true qi. In cases of excess, one should consider it as a deficiency. This condition involves both liver and spleen, often as a gradual progression of chronic fright, which should be carefully examined. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lips are the flowers of the spleen, and the mouth is the opening of the spleen. Moreover, the Yangming meridian encircles the lips and mouth, intersecting at the philtrum. The Yangming corresponds to the stomach; therefore, those with spleen and stomach deficiency often present this symptom, not only after illness. The spleen governs saliva; if the spleen is weak, it cannot control it, leading to excessive salivation, which may be mistakenly recognized as phlegm. Using medicines to expel it will result in further depletion of fluids and an inability to nourish the muscles and tendons, causing spasms in the limbs and worsening the condition. The treatment method is similar to that for chronic spleen wind; one should employ strengthening medicines for the spleen and stomach, adding Asarum and Bupleurum, while avoiding substances like Qing Pi and Gentian. One should also observe the color: yellow indicates a weak spleen; green suggests a dominant liver; greenish-yellow that lacks luster indicates wood overcoming earth; a combination of green and red suggests wood-fire wind-heat; black represents cold water undermining earth; and white signifies Qi deficiency and loss of Yang. In all these cases, it is advisable to use the Six Gentleman Decoction with an addition of the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the limbs are slightly convulsing, or if there are intermittent sensations of heat, diarrhea, vomiting, or a sallow complexion, these point to damage to the spleen and stomach, for which Bai Zhu, Huang Qi, Chuan Xiong, Dang Gui, Ren Shen, Chen Pi, and Sha Ren should be used to replenish stomach Qi. If there is weakness in the spleen and stomach, the Wu Wei Yi Gong Powder should be used, and for deficiency and cold, one may add Mu Xiang and roasted ginger. If spleen Qi is sinking, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to elevate the Yang. For thirst, use the Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder to generate fluids. If the liver wood overacts on the spleen, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Bai Shao to strengthen the spleen and nourish the liver.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences sudden diarrhea, it is attributed to dispiritedness caused by the liver. The liver, associated with wood, when overactive, will negatively affect the spleen. When the spleen is weakened, food is not properly digested, and the water pathways are unregulated, leading to diarrhea that appears green, sometimes accompanied by convulsions. This is because cultivation relates to the liver’s color, while convulsions are a symptom of liver issues. There are also instances where the wet nurse&#39;s spleen is deficient due to shock, or where anger stirs up liver fire, contributing to this condition. The classics state: anger causes the qi to rebel, which can lead to vomiting blood and severe diarrhea; the appropriate treatment is to calm the liver and nourish the lungs, avoiding harsh purgatives that would further weaken the spleen. If liver disturbances become severe, even leading to convulsions, it signals excessive liver fire and imbalances in the central region. Whenever signs of shock are observed, one should use formulas like the Four Gentlemen or Six Gentlemen Decoctions, combined with white Atractylodes to pacify wind and Chai Hu to soothe the liver, preventing severe diarrhea and ensuring safety. If there are already signs of diarrhea, vomiting, shock, and convulsions, yet one does not know to nourish the spleen and soothe the liver to preserve life, then they have strayed far from the path.</p>
<p><strong>Thirst</strong></p>
<p>Yan states: Symptoms like shock, wind, or diarrhea causing thirst are all due to the consumption of body fluids. Regardless of yin or yang, one should prepare Qian&#39;s White Atractylodes Powder, ensuring ample and satisfying hydration.

<p>Zeng said: After a sudden shock from sky fishing, it may turn into tidal fever, with cold limbs, resembling malaria. This is because after being ill, one does not take proper care, and external wind and evil invade through vulnerabilities in the meridians, remaining unresolved, leading to this. The classics say: &quot;In heavy Yang there must be Yin.&quot; It also states: &quot;Excess causes harm; moderation controls it.&quot; This is its principle. One should take Chaihu decoction with cinnamon and Danggui powder. If the energy is strong, then use Wuxi pills and Shuijing pills, slightly combined with dispersing and harmonizing Qi powder to stop the supplementation, later using Shenling Baizhu powder for regulation, naturally leading to recovery. The medicines used for this condition should incorporate bitter and cold flavors to diminish the excessive Yang fire; overcoming the Lung&#39;s metal helps balance the Liver&#39;s wood, dispersing the wind-yang—thus it is a good method.</p>

If taking the previous remedy aggravates the symptoms, it indicates that the pathogenic qi has left but the spleen qi is deficient; one should use Yi Gong San with added Chuanxiong and Angelica for replenishment. If due to liver channel deficiency heat or depletion of true qi causes virtual heat to generate wind, one should use Yi Gong San and Di Huang Wan for supplementation. If there is exhaustion of spleen qi due to diarrhea with abdominal distension, this indicates loss of central qi; one should use Bai Zhu San for supplementation. If there is inherent weakness of qi and blood, or if one has taken purging medicines and is frequently adjusting clothing, grinding teeth, and yawning, this indicates severe deficiency of the liver channel; one should urgently use Di Huang Wan for replenishment.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

<p>Heavenly Fishing is also an indication of a startling wind; however, when Heavenly Fishing occurs, one looks up, and the startling wind is not present. Tang said: When a child is afflicted with convulsions, their eyes roll back and they gaze upward as if possessed, this is known as Heavenly Fishing. For those suffering from this condition, it is advisable to take Suhexiang Pills, and to cauterize the fleshy part of the thumb on both hands halfway at two points, with boys first cauterizing the left and girls the right. Additionally, cauterize the space between the big toes on both feet three to five times each, and also cauterize the palms of the hands front and back five times each. These methods are effective.</p>
<p>Zhang said: When a child&#39;s heart is obstructed, with phlegm and heat accumulating and unable to be dispelled, it may be due to the wetness and toxic air from the nursing mother consuming alcohol and meat, which flows into the milk and causes the child’s condition to worsen. The evil heat and toxic air affect the spirit, leading to symptoms of fright, rolling eyes, persistent heavy heat, and convulsions in the limbs, this ailment is called Heavenly Fishing. In severe cases, the nails may turn blue, resembling possession.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yin-Yang Two Types of Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>When yang epilepsy first manifests, the patient experiences body heat, followed by convulsions, fear, crying out, and shouting; a floating pulse indicates yang epilepsy, which is a sudden shock. This condition is rooted in the six hollow organs and is manifest on the skin, making it relatively easy to treat. </p>
<p>If the illness starts with body cold, without fear or seizures or shouting, and has a deep pulse, it indicates yin epilepsy, which is a chronic shock. This condition is internal to the five zang organs and external to the bones and marrow, making it difficult to treat if severe.</p>
<p>According to the Zeng family, yang epilepsy occurs after being startled by wind three times, and if wind and phlegm are not expelled, it will recur. The three occurrences should not be interpreted as three times in one day; rather, it may happen once in a month or a season, but it must occur three times overall, hence the term &quot;three times.&quot; The term &quot;three occurrences of frightful wind&quot; refers to this meaning. </p>
<p>The symptoms of this illness include body heat with sweating, eyes looking upward, grinding of teeth, jerking of limbs, a reddish-purple complexion, and a floating rapid pulse. Treat this with &quot;Bai Jie San&quot; added to &quot;Wu He Tang&quot; decoction for relief; next, expel phlegm using &quot;Shui Jing Dan&quot; or &quot;Ban Xia Wan.&quot;</p>
<p>Yin epilepsy arises from lingering phlegm after a chronic fright, with phlegm entering the pericardium. Symptoms include reversed cold in the limbs, sticking out of the tongue and head shaking, chewing white foam, tightly clenched jaws, but not severe in shock or convulsions. The complexion may appear white or blue, with a subtle deep pulse. Thus, the &quot;Children&#39;s Treasure Book&quot; states: “During sleep, when the tongue is protruded and the head shakes, this is what it refers to.” </p>
<p>Treat this condition with &quot;Gu Zhen Tang&quot; plus &quot;Hui Sheng Tang&quot; cooked together, and adjust with &quot;Kuan Qi Yin&quot; for relief.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

According to &quot;Comprehensive Formulas for Infants,&quot; wind-induced epilepsy arises from improper care leading to disharmony in blood and qi, or from heavy clothing causing sweating, which opens the pores, allowing wind pathogens to enter. This illness affects the liver, which governs wind, and the symptoms include a pale face, red eyes, and convulsions. Treatment involves wind-dispelling ointments, major green ointments, and amber powders to calm shocks; if there is heat, administer the Four Harmonizing Drink followed by calming pills to resolve phlegm.</p>
<p>Shock-induced epilepsy stems from strong blood and qi, internal heat within the organs, or shock and fright that disturb the spirit, allowing external pathogens to enter. This condition affects the heart, which governs shock. Symptoms include sudden cries and convulsions, treated with amber powders, red dragon powders, and heart-soothing pills, again with the Four Harmonizing Drink and calming pills, ensuring it does not lead to other illnesses.</p>
<p>Food-induced epilepsy affects the spleen, which governs the digestion of food. Symptoms include belching with foul odors and convulsions. This may also present with sour-smelling stools that require treatment with purple pills. The three types above are largely similar and fall under the category of yang conditions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Five Organ Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;San Yin&quot; states: In ancient methods, there are various convulsions, including the five convulsions, five organ convulsions, and six livestock convulsions, each with different symptoms, making comprehensive documentation difficult. The &quot;Bie Lu&quot; records the symptoms of the five convulsions: </p>
<ol>
<li>The horse convulsion, which produces a horse&#39;s neigh, corresponds to the horse in the noon position, associated with the Heart governed by the Hand&#39;s Lesser Yin; thus, the illness pertains to the heart. </li>
<li>The sheep convulsion, producing a sheep&#39;s bleat, corresponds to the sheep in the late morning position, associated with the Spleen governed by the Foot&#39;s Greater Yin; thus, it pertains to the spleen. </li>
<li>The chicken convulsion, producing a chicken&#39;s crow, corresponds to the chicken in the evening position, associated with the Stomach governed by the Foot’s Yang Brightness; thus, it pertains to the stomach. </li>
<li>The pig convulsion, producing a pig&#39;s grunt, corresponds to the pig in the late night position, associated with the Heart Protector governed by the Hand&#39;s Lesser Yang; thus, it pertains to the right kidney. </li>
<li>The cow convulsion, producing a cow&#39;s moo, corresponds to the cow in the early morning position, associated with the Lung governed by the Hand&#39;s Greater Yin; thus, it pertains to the lungs.</li>
</ol>
<p>These five convulsions correspond to the five livestock and the five organs. When they occur, there may be dizziness, confusion, drooping of the mouth and eyes, shaking of the eyes, convulsions in the hands and feet, rigidity of the spine, and recovery shortly after, each treated according to their respective causes. </p>
<p>In treating the five convulsions, severe cases can be fatal, and those with significant illness can also die, while lighter cases can be managed with the Five Colors Pill. According to the &quot;Qian Jin,&quot; speaking of livestock convulsions lacks distinction regarding the five organs; Qian’s family initially made these distinctions but did not include the horse convulsion. Zeng’s family claims that the initial occurrence with sounds of sheep or dogs indicates the throat is obstructed by wind phlegm, leading to such sounds, a theory that is quite clear. </p>
<p>The term &#39;six livestock&#39; simply represents a strong designation. Thus, Dan Xi notes that the classics do not provide a basis for this, and treatment methods do not seem to delineate five distinctions, so it is unnecessary to separate them into five. </p>

For instance, if a child has a fever and phlegm, shows no desire for milk, sleeps restlessly, and frequently is startled or anxious, these are early signs of seizures. In such cases, using Zishuang Pill can guide the treatment. By reducing its strong Qi, the risk of seizures can be avoided. When the symptoms of the seizure first appear, there will surely be blue lines like threads between the high bones behind the ears; seeing this indicates the need for bloodletting and crying out to ensure the Qi flows. If there are seizures and the person cannot speak, it is because the throat, being the pathway of Qi, is affected by wind, obstructing the voice&#39;s passage, or it may be caused by blood stasis in the heart that prevents the heart&#39;s pathways from being open.

Liu stated: Children have weak spirits; when startled, their spirit does not guard the house, leaving it empty and allowing phlegm and saliva to return. If there are issues with diet, causing damage to the spleen and stomach, it accumulates as phlegm fluid, leading to phlegm obstructing the heart orifices. The treatment method should clear heat and guide phlegm; however, predecessors often used sedatives to calm the heart. This can treat heat and clear phlegm, but if there is stubborn phlegm that is adhesive, this medicine may not easily eliminate it. In such cases, vomiting must be induced first, and only after that should this medicine be taken. If phlegm is indeed inside, it must also be expelled, adjusted according to the severity of the illness.</p>
<p>Jie Gu stated: If there are external phlegm and fever with a sound, brew a decoction of rhubarb and schizonepeta, and take the Five Colors Pill. </p>
<p>For intermittent heat accumulation, the Peach Branch Pill is the main treatment. If the fever persists, use a decoction of Earth Bone Skin to take the Five Colors Pill. </p>

Qian Zhongyang uses Xieqing Wan, which treats excess heat in the liver channel, as searching for clothing and seizing empty space are symptoms of failure post-illness. However, if one seeks out true excess heat, there is rarely any to be found, and the practitioner must discern it carefully. Wang Haizang’s treatise addresses blood loss with symptoms of searching for clothing, seizing empty space, touching the bed, hands waving, head shaking, disjointed speech, irregular and floating pulse, internal agitation due to blood loss, extreme heat, and coarse breath with dry nose; this is difficult to treat, and Sheng Dihuang and Huang Lian Decoction should be prescribed.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Stunned Paralysis in the Crane&#39;s Knee</strong></p>
<p>The liver corresponds to the eastern green dragon wood; its movement responds to the wind, and when ill, it signifies shock and fright. Various heat conditions can provoke liver wind; if there is wind, phlegm arises, and with phlegm comes convulsions. During a child’s seizure, hands and feet may twitch—one should allow the child to find their own rhythm before intervening to avoid creating other symptoms. If parents, seeing the alarming state of their child, restrain them, they fail to realize that the tendons are linked to the liver. When an illness strikes, if the hands and feet are held down, the tendons cannot relax, leading the meridians to be blocked by wind, ultimately resulting in the child becoming incapacitated. The Inner Classic states that stubborn weakness is called &quot;slow wind,&quot; and heavy pain is known as &quot;damp obstruction.&quot; Additionally, there are instances of paralysis, numbness, and unbearable swelling and pain in the extremities, caused by the noxious energy of wind. Hence, it is said: &quot;Wind corrupting the extremities results in this.&quot; Common signs in children include irregular palpitations and swelling pain throughout the body, or uncoordinated limbs; these are signs of stunned paralysis. If treatment is delayed, lumps may form between the joints of the arms, wrists, knees, and shins, or the knees may swell, with flesh wasting away to reveal bone, resembling a crane&#39;s knee.

The next options include Fangji Tang (Stephania Decoction), Qufeng San (Wind-Dispelling Powder), and Duhuo Tang (Duhuo Decoction), adding Sangjisheng (Mulberry Mistletoe) for intake, along with Fangfeng Tang (Siler Decoction) or Heihudan (Black Tiger Dan) made into small pills taken intermittently, to prevent the generation of wind and phlegm, thus making recovery easier. For severe pain from paralysis or abscesses, use half raw and half stir-fried Qian Niu Zi (Plantago Seeds), slightly crushed and decocted. Mix it with Wuling San using some wine to remove the cold dampness from flowing collaterals, which can reduce swelling and toxins.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a></p></div>

<p>Xue&#39;s commentary states: The condition known as &quot;crane knee wind&quot; leads to gradually thinner legs and thicker knees, resembling a crane&#39;s knee, hence the name. This is due to insufficient kidney qi, with external pathogens causing the ailment. Initially, there may be pain inside the knee with no change in color outside, and difficulty in bending and stretching. If it develops into swelling, with red color and pus within one or two months, it can be treated; however, if it is hard, white, and does not develop pus, it is difficult to treat. For early onset, use Dafenfeng Decoction as the main treatment, supplemented with Yiqi Yangrong Decoction; for cases with pus, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction as the main treatment, supplemented with Dafenfeng Decoction. Avoid using medicines like Shixuan Liqi, and if symptoms like fever or non-abscessing persist, it&#39;s necessary to adjust and tonify the spleen and stomach appropriately, otherwise, it will surely lead to complications.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Section on Children&#39;s Epileptic Seizures</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Pediatric Health [Author Unknown, Song Dynasty]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epileptic Seizures with Teeth Grinding</strong></p>
<p>When children experience seizures, if they grind their teeth without pause, or if they have previously had seizures and still tend to grind their teeth, I once treated a child of a physician named Li who had such symptoms. I consulted several doctors, and some suggested that this was due to &quot;fright entering the kidneys.&quot; This notion derives from a line in a song by the Master Wang of Jiayue, which states, &quot;grinding teeth in sleep fright enters the kidneys.&quot; This implies that teeth are related to bones, and bones are related to the kidneys; hence it was said this way. However, this is often repeated without evidence; there are no records in ancient texts, nor is there any principle that supports &quot;fright entering the kidneys,&quot; and indeed, the use of medications has proven ineffective.</p>
<p>Now, upon careful examination of the symptoms, I clarify that this represents a disease of the Foot Yangming channel. The Foot Yangming is the channel of the stomach, originating at the nose, crossing the cheeks, entering the teeth, and returning to exit around the lips, descending to intersect with the jaw, and finally exiting at the Great Welcome point, following the cheekbones. Moreover, the act of seizing is due to wind; wind is associated with wood, while the stomach is associated with earth. Wood can control earth, thus when teeth are afflicted by wind, they become itchy, and the cheekbone region, affected by external pathogens, becomes tense, causing the child to grind their teeth constantly to alleviate the urgency in the cheek area and relieve the itchiness of the teeth. Therefore, treatment should focus on dispelling wind from the stomach.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dark Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Dark convulsions resemble shocking convulsions and also resemble stroke-related spasms. When an episode occurs, it comes on suddenly, causing the person to collapse, with their mind troubled and spirits confused, thoughts muddled and breath disordered. The hands and feet twitch, and there may be spasms, with a gurgling sound in the throat, sometimes resulting in the expulsion of phlegm or yelling. The pulse exhibits an intensity of both yin and yang. The episodes can last a whole day or half a day if they are distant, and for one or two hours if they are closer. After the attack, the person gets up as if they were not ill, commonly referred to as convulsive disease; those with milder symptoms are called dark wind. The ancients also said: in mild cases, the attack is called shock; in severe cases, it is called convulsion. Mild cases have frail and weak qi and blood, making them easily affected and causing more injuries; severe cases have strong qi and blood, making them more resilient and suffering less.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Symptoms of Shock Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>For children with shocking convulsions, once the attack settles, there may be residual symptoms that do not subside. Although the main condition may have ceased, the underlying issue remains. This can occur due to excessive intake of hot or cold medicine or improper use of purging treatments, causing the convulsions and residual symptoms to persist.</p>
<p><strong>Shock Convulsions Accompanied by Other Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>In children with prolonged convulsions, all five organs become deficient and are impacted by the illness. When an episode occurs, it affects the heart&#39;s blood, the lung&#39;s qi, the liver&#39;s spasms, the spleen&#39;s confusion, and the kidney&#39;s cold. There may also be cases where deficiency causes other illnesses to arise or where other illnesses provoke shocking convulsions; some cases may require a combination of treatments to address both conditions.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Immediate and Delayed Shock</strong></p>
<p>Shock can be immediate or delayed, indicating different underlying conditions. Immediate shock may be caused by a cold or fever, improper digestion, sudden sights or sounds, or physical falls. When shocked, the liver becomes affected, leading to internal wind pathogens causing disturbances, with fire fueled by this wind. The interplay of wind and fire results in symptoms such as convulsions, shaking of the head, protrusion of the tongue, and excessive drooling due to blockage. After a while, the person may return to their original state. The pulse becomes rapid, floating, tight, and urgent due to the violent nature of wind and fire.</p>
<p>Qian suggests that there are symptoms without yin involvement. This is because the heart&#39;s heat is excessive, and the yin cannot balance the yang, indicating an excess of yang and insufficiency of yin. In cases of phlegm accumulation, use a diluted saliva powder to clear the phlegm, followed by Qingxian Pills, Lijin Pills, or Zhenjing Pills to dispel liver wind and reduce heart fire. If the mouth is unable to open for swallowing, administer through the nose, loosening the jaw slightly, and use emetic medicines as necessary. For phlegm that cannot be expelled, use bamboo juice or ginger juice to induce vomiting. Alternatively, use Xiaoniuhuang Pills or Gunping Pills to expel the phlegm, while identifying the specific cause for treatment. If the shock is due to overeating, remedy the food stagnation; if from exposure to wind or cold, dispel the pathogen; if caused by fear or shock, calm the heart, avoiding a one-size-fits-all shock treatment.</p>
<p>If the shock persists without awakening, urgently stimulate the nose with a sneezing powder or crumpled paper. If there are no sneezes, or if the person cannot cry out, the mouth is rigid and unresponsive, sweat beads on the forehead, and there is involuntary urination—the signs are indicative of imminent death.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Slow fright occurs from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, or due to prolonged illness leading to deficiency in both the spleen and lungs. As a result, the liver wood flows unchecked, and the earth is overrun by wind and wood, causing a state of fright. It manifests as convulsions that aren’t severe, resembling sleep but not a stable slumber, with a pale face and a cold body. When in sleep, the eyes may remain open, and the limbs along with the breath in the mouth and nose are all cold. The pulse is deep, slow, weak, and failing, which the Qian family identifies as a sign of yang deficiency. This is primarily due to significant deficiency in the spleen earth, where yang cannot overcome yin, indicating a condition of excess yin and deficiency of yang. The treatment should focus on warming and supplementing the spleen and stomach. The presence of phlegm and fluid is also caused by the spleen and stomach&#39;s inability to transform and transport, and must not be abruptly removed. Even when there are convulsive episodes, they result from the weakness of spleen earth inviting the wood to conquer and must not be treated by stopping wind. Slow fright essentially lacks heat; even if there is an occurrence of fever, it is still virtual heat. One must avoid cooling treatments for fright, and only warm and supplement the spleen and stomach will allow the liver wood to find peace.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is like soil being thin yet having a large tree on top; it cannot bear the weight, and thus moves by itself without the wind. If the soil is thickly cultivated, allowing the roots to deepen and the foundation to be solid, then it will naturally be free from harm even in the absence of wind. It is also necessary to compare the subtle balance of yin and yang when using medicine. If the case is a lingering one and there is still a yang sign, there is no need to restore yang; rather, one should use a different formula to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach, slightly adding ingredients like Gastrodia, Scorpion, White Aconite, and Bile Star to counteract wind and stabilize convulsions. If yang is diminished and yin is excessive, with a cool body and a pale face, purely a case of lingering fright, it is advisable to use a modified formula of Atractylodes and White Aconite, or a modified Yang-restoring powder. If the limbs are cold and the two excretions are uncontrollable, with hair standing on end, head shaking, eyes not turning, foaming at the mouth with a crow-like sound, this indicates a fatal condition.</p>
<p>In general, for fright, do not use drugs that tranquilize and dissolve phlegm; instead, one should calm the spirit and nourish the heart. The reason is that fright is due to insufficient heart energy; the more it is forced down, the more it becomes vacuous. If phlegm and fright permeate into the emptiness, then treatment is impossible.</p>
<p>Regarding fetal fright:</p>
<p>In the first hundred days after a child is born, if there is no fright or fear but there are convulsions that occur intermittently, or if the child locks their eyes and mouth, or has excessive drooling and vomiting, or clenches their fists with a strong body, this is termed fetal fright. First, use the Fright-Relieving Pills, and then use the Embracing Dragon Pills.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Twitching</strong></p>
<p>Twitching occurs due to heat and phlegm stagnating in the chest and abdomen, with wind and fire alternating, thus causing the limbs to convulse. When twitching occurs, if a man looks left without sound and right with sound, and a woman looks right without sound and left with sound, this is due to the conflict between metal and wood. If there is a “Mu Lian Zha” symptom, it arises from internal liver wind stirring upwards into the eyes. If the eyes are straight and looking, this is due to heat entering the eyes, pulling the muscles and veins, causing tightness in both corners, preventing turning and glancing. If twitching is triggered by sudden fright or wind epilepsy, it is advisable to use “Jing Wan” or “Gun Tan Wan,” both prepared with peppermint, gastrodia, and uncarried vine decoction. </p>
<p>If there are symptoms after vomiting or diarrhea, it indicates a deficiency of the spleen and stomach. When there is no wind to dispel, and no phlegm to eliminate, it is recommended to use “Liu Jun Zi” decoction with added gastrodia, uncarried vine, peony, wood fragrance, and seele, to regulate the liver and tonify the spleen. If yang energy has sunk, the “Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang” with ginger and cinnamon should be added. For a deficiency of yang energy, use “Shen Fu Tang.” </p>
<p>Should twitching occur due to food stagnation and phlegm accumulation, leading to this manifestation, it signifies that the spleen is weak and cannot generate metal, thus metal is deficient and cannot control wood, which causes wood&#39;s disturbances. One should strengthen the spleen and aid digestion; the symptoms will naturally resolve and should not use cooling sedatives and such medications. Generally, if twitching is frequent, it indicates wind on the surface, which is easy to treat and can be dispersed. If twitching is rare, it indicates wind is within the organs and is difficult to treat; thus, spleen tonification is required.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a></p></div>

I aim to break the confusion for the younger generation, thus dispelling the misunderstandings thereafter. Infants and young children, whose muscles, bones, organs, and blood vessels are not yet fully developed, have an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin, unlike a matured body of seven feet where yin and yang are balanced. Therefore, with insufficient yin and excess yang, it is easy for internal heat to arise, and when heat is abundant, phlegm, wind, and fright occur, which is consistent. If there had been a name assigned to it as &#39;heat phlegm wind fright&#39; back in the day, people would not be confused. As it was inconvenient to attach four characters, only two were dropped, leading to &#39;fright&#39; at the beginning and &#39;wind&#39; at the end, and later generations did not understand, thus considering it a peculiar disease.&quot;<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

Therefore, when ill, the tendons and meridians are strained, giving rise to all sorts of names for these &quot;pulling, twitching, and curved bow&quot; symptoms.

Such statements are nonsensical and surprisingly come from knowledgeable individuals, serving to support the mistaken belief in &quot;wind disturbances.&quot; It is not considered that children are not resistant to typhoid fever; once they catch a cold with solar influence, they already have strong bodies and sweat a lot, their tendons and pulses are affected, and they become drowsy—by this point they are already suffering from the core illness. Randomly administering herbal remedies can lead to death in quick succession, which prevents any understanding of the transmission of the illness. This is why some claim that children do not experience typhoid fever.</p>
<p>It is not recognized that children are more susceptible to external factors and prone to fevers, with typhoid fever being especially common, mistakenly thought as &quot;wind disturbance&quot; by many. For children, it is crucial to recover from typhoid fever within three days; if one waits until the illness has fully developed, endurance will certainly fail. Additionally, there are differences in symptoms: rigid convulsions occur without sweating, while soft convulsions include sweating. Children more often experience soft convulsions than rigid ones. Physicians, upon noticing excessive sweating and a muddled consciousness, often misdiagnose this as chronic wind disturbance and use herbs like ginseng, astragalus, and atractylodes to close the pores, preventing the heat pathogen from exiting, which is also greatly harmful, though somewhat less so than using stronger medicinal substances.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when treating the fevers of young children, one should focus on clearing the exterior and not reinforce the interior. Zhang Zhongjing originally had the Gui Zhi formula; if it is abandoned and alternative treatments from the Dongyuan are pursued, even the smallest error can lead to great deviations and thus requires meticulous attention. Furthermore, postpartum women who lose excessive blood may experience symptoms of yin deficiency and yang excess, presenting with cold and fever, resembling those of young children. Physicians often mistakenly treat this as &quot;postpartum wind,&quot; a notion that is particularly laughable. It is important to understand that my approach to dispelling wind does not imply there is no &quot;wind disease.&quot; Children are timid and weak in spirit; when they encounter strange sights or sounds or suddenly fall, they become frightened. Their faces may turn pale, and they may become overly fussy and cry excessively. This is different from being obstructed by heat evil, where the spirit becomes clouded, and they do not respond to loud noises such as bells or gunshots. A thorough examination will reveal the errors in confusing the symptoms of wind with those of other conditions. </p>
<p>Since the younger generation comes to my door, they are guided by the light of superior principles, invigorating their lungs and intestines. Suddenly, they gain profound understanding, akin to drinking from a deep pool. However, if one only seeks resolution from the text, many important teachings will remain uncommunicated.</p>
<p><strong>Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s bodies are delicate and their spirits timid; they do not withstand external strong heat, which often leads to convulsions. Later generations have recklessly named these &quot;wind&quot; without understanding, creating a confused theory with four signs and eight symptoms. In reality, the head shaking and hand stiffness in convulsions indicate the spasms of &quot;wind,&quot; and the extreme arching of the neck and back signifies the arched response to &quot;wind.&quot; Many pediatricians uniformly accept this diagnosis, but families often passively tolerate external harmful influences. Instead of treating these with appropriate remedies, they resort to harsh medicines like minerals, which cause many deaths without remorse.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: When children have epilepsy, it is due to insufficient blood and qi, and their spirit is not fully formed. It may also be caused by the invasion of pathogenic wind or by shock and fright. There are cases where it arises from emotional disturbances during pregnancy. If the eyes stare straight, the mouth is shut and saliva flows, the abdomen is distended with convulsions, the neck and back arch, the waist and spine are rigid, and the body appears lifeless, remaining unresponsive all day, this is termed &quot;zhen&quot; (a severe type of epilepsy). </p>
<p>In treating the five types of epilepsy, it is essential to follow the principles of the corresponding organs. Each organ is associated with a specific animal form, and the primary treatment involves the use of five-colored pills, supplemented with medicinal herbs from the respective meridians. If the seizures are severe, death may occur. If the patient exhibits a flushed face and bulging eyes, sticks out the tongue, bites the lips, and experiences palpitation and shortness of breath with a voice that sounds like a goat, this is called &quot;xin xian&quot; (heart epilepsy). For blood deficiency, use the Heart Nourishing Decoction; if there is heat caused by drinking cold fluids, use Tiger Eye Pills for real heat; if the heat arises from drinking soup, apply the Pure Cinnabar Fragrance Pill for false heat.</p>
<p>If the face is green, the lips are blue, the eyes protrude, the limbs are stiff and twisted with a voice resembling a dog, this is termed &quot;gan xian&quot; (liver epilepsy). For liver deficiency, use the Rehmannia Pill; if there is strong convulsing, use Chai Hu to clear the liver; if there is constipation, use the Blue Purging Pill. If the face is black, the eyes vibrate, there is drooling, the body appears like a corpse, and the voice resembles a pig, this is called &quot;shen xian&quot; (kidney epilepsy). Use Rehmannia Pills or similar remedies for treatment, as the kidney has no purging methods and should be treated directly for deficiency.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

For those with weak lung qi, use the Lung Supplement Powder; if the face is pale and yellow, indicating that the earth cannot produce, use the Five Flavor Distinctive Function Powder; if the face is red, it indicates that yin fire is rising to the lungs, use the Rehmannia Pill. If the face is withered and yellow, the eyes are straight and the abdomen is distended, with involuntary diarrhea and a voice like that of an ox, this is known as spleen convulsion, use the Five Flavor Distinctive Function Powder. If the face is green, with diarrhea and little appetite, use the Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with added Mu Xiang and Chai Hu. If there is fever and convulsions, lying on the back, the face has a glossy sheen, and the pulse is floating, the illness is in the bowels, representing a yang condition, easy to treat. If the body is cold and there are no spasms, lying face down, the face is dark, and the pulse is sinking, the illness is in the organs, representing a yin condition, difficult to treat. For any of these symptoms, it is best first to examine the ears and the area above the cheekbones; if there are blue vein patterns, lance them to draw blood, which can avert suffering. All these indicate a deficiency of vital energy; one should primarily use the Purple River Horse Pill and assist with nourishing medicines. If one recklessly exhausts and injures the vital energy, this will inevitably lead to recurring attacks, and over time to life-threatening conditions, often resulting in inability to be saved. There are also three types of convulsions: fright convulsion, wind convulsion, and food convulsion. For fright convulsion, use Jing Pill, Fuling Pill, Qian&#39;s Heart Nourishing Decoction, Chen Mercury Aromatic Powder, Qing Shen Decoction, or Hu Jing Pill. For wind convulsion, use Qian&#39;s Niu Huang Pill, Xiaofeng Pill, or Xing Su Powder. For food convulsion, use Miaosheng Pill.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Astonishing Wind</strong></p>
<p>The key points of astonishing wind comprise two: one is substantive evidence, and the other is insubstantial evidence. For acute astonishment, it is a yang condition, a substantive evidence, where the excess of liver evil generates heat, and heat predominates phlegm. When phlegm-heat invades the heart and diaphragm, wind and fire clash, leading to urgent and violent manifestations and an abundance of phlegm-heat. This is termed acute astonishment, which should first treat the symptoms and then address the root cause. As for chronic astonishment, it pertains to yin, being an insubstantial condition, where both spleen and lungs are deficient, and liver evil is unconstrained, thus undermining the spleen and generating wind. This is without yang symptoms, hence the condition presents with both energy and spirit deficiency, categorized as chronic astonishment. Here, one ought to focus on rescuing the original energy of the spleen and kidneys. </p>
<p>Although both are termed astonishing wind, the differences between substantial and insubstantial are distinct, which is why the names acute and chronic vary. In treating this, one must not overlook the names to understand their meanings. </p>
<p>In children, astonishing wind indicates liver disease but also involves spleen, kidney, heart, and lung diseases. Children have insufficient true yin, and their softness fails to overcome rigidity, making liver evil easy to activate. When liver evil stirs, wood can generate fire, fire can generate wind, and when wind and heat clash, blood becomes deficient. Blood deficiency leads to tight muscles; tight muscles result in symptoms like convulsions, dizziness, and extreme rigidity, all of which root back to the fundamental issues of the liver wood.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the elements are displaced, if wood disrupts earth, it causes spleen disease resulting in phlegm, vomiting, and diarrhea; when wood flourishes and metal declines, it leads to lung disease resulting in wheezing and shortness of breath; when wood-fire rises, it causes heart disease manifesting as agitation and restlessness; when wood-fire harms yin, it leads to kidney disease resulting in dry water, blood dryness, liver thirst, inability to sweat, convulsions, and spasms. This is essentially the general concept of wind diseases affecting the five zang organs. </p>
<p>To treat this, there are essential principles. First is wind, second is fire, third is phlegm, fourth is yang deficiency, and fifth is yin deficiency. If one can discern these urgent issues, they can be thoroughly addressed. The term &quot;wind&quot; refers to its strong, rigid, and dizzying effects, all linked to liver wood; hence it is called &quot;startling wind and heat.&quot; This is not an external pathogen, and many today do not understand this meaning, believing that treating wind must always involve dispersants. They do not realize that while external wind can be dispersed, the wind from blood dryness cannot. </p>
<p>Thus, herbs like Fangfeng, Jingjie, Qianghuo, Duhuo, Xixin, Gancao, Chaihu, Zisu, and Bohe should only be used when there are signs of external pathogens causing fever without sweating. If there is no external pathogen, they should be avoided; caution is essential when using dispersants. As for phlegm-fire, phlegm condenses and blocks qi, while excessive fire depletes yin; this is the root of the pathogen. If phlegm arises due to fire, treat the fire first; if fire is retained due to phlegm, then focus on eliminating the phlegm.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For excess fire, one should favor herbs such as gentian, gardenia, yellow bitter, yellow bracken, gypsum, and rhubarb. For mild fire, one should prefer herbs like scutellaria, anemarrhena, original ginseng, dendrobium, earth bone peel, akebia, and gastrodia. For excessive phlegm, one should use herbs such as cattle gall, gall bladder stone, turmeric, south star, pinellia, and white mustard seed. For mild phlegm, one should choose herbs like dried tangerine peel, radix peucedani, sea stone, fritillaria, and balloon flower powder.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the color of vermilion is red and heavy, it can enter the heart to calm fright; containing mercury, it effectively clears channels and eliminates phlegm while lowering fire. The strong aroma and taste of realgar can break up stagnation and reach obstruction directly. Borneol and musk are essential medicines for opening the orifices. Amber and indigo are merely assistive agents for clearing and benefiting. </p>
<p>Also, worms like silkworms, scorpions, and cicada sloughs are said to treat wind. The silkworm has a salty and spicy flavor, greatly capable of opening phlegm and breaking stagnant energy. Using phlegm-removing medicines effectively eliminates the evil from the liver and spleen; when the evil is gone, the liver regulates, which is indeed the treatment for wind. The scorpion, which originates in the northeast and has a green color associated with wood, is good for treating contrived conditions. Combined with its salty taste, it helps reduce phlegm and is thus also categorized under wind treatment, although it is secondary to the silkworm. </p>
<p>The cicada slough has a light and thin nature, primarily to derive its meaning of clearing and shedding light; without substantial efficacy, it is not something to rely on. In general, for wind disturbances, phlegm-fire is the most substantial, followed by wind.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of treating the real (diseases) stops here. However, diseases of false and real (conditions) are easily controlled, while the principal defeats must be in danger. Indeed, if yang is deficient, then the yin pathogens do not disperse, and the original qi does not recover; if yin is deficient, then the nutritive qi cannot circulate, and where does the essence and blood come from? Thus, the gravitas of wind fright in heavy cases lies significantly in deficiency. Without deficiency, there is no heaviness; without depletion, there is no danger. The original essence and original qi stand in mutual support; one should not prioritize one over the other. Therefore, the method of treating deficiency must differentiate between yin and yang. For yang deficiency, one should use dryness and rigidity; for yin deficiency, one should use warmth and moistening. However, those skilled in using yang find that within the qi there is naturally water; those skilled in using yin find that within the water there is naturally qi. The subtlety of creation requires mutual reliance, thus there are aspects that cannot be confused and aspects that cannot be separated. If someone claims this is not a medicine for children, nor a remedy for wind fright, could it be that the disease of wind fright does not pertain to yin and yang, and that the body of the child does not rely on blood and qi? As for humans, one can see the heart as soon as they open their mouth; how can we not discuss the unity of heaven and earth? </p>
<p>The diseases of wind fright manifest as rigidity, convulsions, and other ailments. In the classic concerning meridians and tendons, it states: &quot;The disease of the foot&#39;s lesser yin tendon involves cramps in the foot, along with painful nodules in the path it takes.&quot; If the disease is here, it presides over epilepsy and spasms. Those afflicted externally cannot bend, while internally they cannot look up. Hence, those suffering from yang illnesses bend backward and cannot bow, while those with yin illnesses cannot look up. Furthermore, it is stated: &quot;The disease of meridians and tendons, when cold, causes them to bend backward and tighten; when hot, causes them to loosen and not contract; in yin atrophy, they do not function.&quot; In yang urgency, they bend backward; in yin urgency, they cannot extend upwards.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Acute Wind Shock</strong></p>
<p>In the case of acute wind shock, there is strong heat and phlegm obstruction, with a narrowed gaze and a paralyzed expression, twitching and trembling, tightness of the jaw, heat in the mouth, flushed cheeks and red lips, cold drinks causing constipation, and a deep and rapid pulse. This indicates an invasion of the liver by wind-heat, associated with excess yang and deficiency of yin. </p>
<p>The treatment for this should consider the urgency. For any significant presence of pathogens, it is essential to first address the superficial symptoms. If phlegm is severe and there is urgent wheezing, one should use prescriptions like Baolong Pill, Amber Powder, Qingge Decoction, or Meihua Drink. If there is excessive fire causing agitation and heat, it is advisable to use Lianjie Pill, Yiqing Pill, or Huanglian Anshen Pill, as well as herbs such as Gardenia, Huanglian, or Gentian. </p>
<p>If there is intense heat and dryness leading to severe constipation, one should use Xieqing Pill. Alternatively, one may prepare it as a decoction or use Lijiang Pill as well. If there is external wind-cold accompanying fever and shock, it should be resolved at the surface, using Yihansan with an increased amount of Chaihu, or choosing from Shen Su Decoction, Wujisan, or Xingsu Powder. If the superficial evil has not been resolved but there is also internal heat, one should use Qian’s Huanglong Decoction. If the wind shock starts to recede but fire remains, one should use Anshen Zhengjing Pill.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Everything mentioned above consists of urgent methods to treat the symptoms, primarily aimed at reducing phlegm and fire. One should then adjust and supplement blood and qi, as outlined in the methods attributed to Xue, or employ gradual treatments for sudden fright to prevent weakness. This is the most essential practice in pediatrics. Previous sages have said: Children are easily affected by deficiency and excess, and the use of aggressive medications should cease as soon as the illness is identified; excessive dosing is indeed a true statement. Generally, these conditions often pertain to the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys, with deficiency in yin and dryness in blood, mixed with wind and fire. If one neglects yin and excessively uses medications to expel wind and transform phlegm, the spleen will become more deficient, and the blood will become drier, allowing pathogenic energy to linger, which will inevitably lead to chronic fright.</p>
<p>Luo Quanshan said: Sudden fright pertains to the fullness of wood, fire, and earth. When wood is full, there are spasms with efficacy, and frequent eye movement with rapid blinking; when earth is full, there is body heat and a red face without vomiting or diarrhea, with the child lying still with eyes closed. The treatment should cool and drain, using cooling and calming pills. There are also cases where fright induces symptoms like clenched jaws and intense heat—here, there is both internal heat and external wind, so one must interrupt the wind and stabilize the spasms. If phlegm heat is still strong, it is advisable to slightly purge it; once the phlegm heat is relieved, one should urgently nourish and support the stomach qi; when spasms are stabilized and phlegm heat has receded, one ought to adjust and supplement spleen qi.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Slow Fright</strong></p>
<p>The condition of slow fright is often caused by vomiting and diarrhea, leading to a weak qi and sluggish spirit, drowsiness with eyes half-open, phlegm sounds and quickened breathing, sudden startles and convulsions, either sporadic episodes or alternating between feelings of cold and heat, or having limbs that feel unusually cold, or lips and brows appearing blue or red, with a pale complexion. However, the pulse is slow and weak, or may be thin and rapid. This indicates wind arising from spleen deficiency, without signs of yang. The slow fright condition in children often results from illness or from vomiting and diarrhea, or from the inappropriate use of medicinal herbs which harms the spleen and stomach. Yet, some children may inherently have weak spleen and stomach, or suffer from wind and cold; such conditions do not necessarily arise from past illnesses or inappropriate medication, and are all related to deficiency and cold in the spleen and kidney. </p>
<p>To treat slow fright, one must quickly nurture the essential qi; conditions like wind and phlegm are not actual evils, and one must not recklessly disperse them, as this could further damage the yang qi, leading to irretrievable consequences. In cases of slight spleen deficiency with mild diarrhea, and with no internal cold, one can tonify gently with formulas like Liu Shen San, Si Jun Zi Tang, or Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If both spleen and kidney are deficient yet the organs show no cold, Wu Fu Yin is appropriate. Moreover, since yin blood originates from the spleen, it is advisable to add Dang Gui and Zao Ren to Si Jun Zi Tang. If the spleen qi is weak and slightly cold, warming formulas like Wen Wei Yin, Li Zhong Tang, or Wu Jun Zi Jian should be recommended.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For individuals with spleen qi deficiency, cold nature, and excessive phlegm, it is advisable to use Liujunzi Decoction or JInshuiliujun Decoction. If both the spleen and kidney are deficient in yin and also cold, the best option is Liyi Decoction. In cases of severe spleen and kidney deficiency with persistent vomiting or diarrhea, one should use Fuzili Yi Decoction; if the situation is even more severe, consider Liuw Wei Huanyang Decoction or Siwei Huanyang Decoction, adjusting the dosage based on the child&#39;s size. For continuous diarrhea due to spleen and kidney deficiency and cold, Weguang Decoction is indicated.</p>
<p>Frequent and sudden fright episodes, and repeated use of purgatives can lead to spleen damage and yin exhaustion, which may transform the condition into chronic fright. It is essential to tonify the spleen, nourish the blood, and supplement with calming herbs to clear the lungs and control the wood element. I suspect that many previous symptoms arise from a deficiency in the spleen and stomach being overcome by the liver&#39;s wood, with external heat manifesting while retaining internal cold. In such cases, using Wuwu Yigong Powder with added Dong Quai, and supporting with Diaoteng Decoction to replenish spleen earth and balance liver wood, also proves effective. If there is no response, add Jiang and Muxiang to warm and tonify the spleen. If that still does not help, promptly include Fuzil to restore yang. However, using drugs to expel wind and resolve phlegm could exacerbate the risk.</p>
<p>I believe Fuzil, known for its warming and yang-restoring properties, is an excellent remedy for chronic fright. If the vital energy is significantly depleted, using it urgently in a processed form is advisable. For severe energy collapse, immediate administration of processed Fuzil is necessary.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Great Shock and Sudden Fear</p>
<p>A child suddenly experiences great shock, which most severely harms the heart&#39;s spirit. The text states: &quot;Great shock and sudden fear lead to the separation of qi and blood, the disruption of yin and yang, blockage of the meridians, and the obstruction of pulse pathways, causing yin and yang to clash and the meridians to become empty. The blood and qi lose their order and deviate from their norm.&quot; This is how the book &quot;Inner Canon&quot; describes the illness caused by shock. Moreover, the impact on a child is far greater than that on an adult. If a child experiences great shock, their spirit and qi are scattered, resulting in chaos and disorder; how can there be any substantial condition present? At such a time, restoring the proper qi is already a daunting task; how can we expect to clear and disperse? Just like substances such as vermilion and amber, they merely carry the idea of weighty calming effects but are not a fundamental cure.</p>
<p>Currently, various pediatric texts all treat the symptoms of great shock uniformly with urgent shock treatment, which is a significant mistake. They fail to understand that urgent shock and slow shock arise from different causes: one from wind-heat and the other from deficiencies of the spleen and kidneys. These should not necessarily be attributed to shock alone. The suffering caused by shock resulting in exhaustion comes from a true injury to the heart and spirit, which leads to the rapid scattering of the qi; thus, the reasons and conditions differ greatly, and one cannot speak of them in the same way.</p>
<p>To treat the illness of qi scattering due to great shock, the focus should be on recovering the spirit and qi. It is advisable to use calming pills, the Seven Fortune drink, Portulaca decoction, and the Ginseng powder, along with decoctions of substances like gold and silver.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms of a child&#39;s frightened crying are different from those of a frightful convulsion, as well as from an intense, sudden fear. This is because a child&#39;s liver energy is yet to be fully developed, and their gallbladder energy is particularly timid. When they hear sudden sounds or see unexpected sights, even if it does not result in intense fear, it can still disturb their spirit and soul. While awake, they may experience this disturbance, and in sleep, they might become startled or restless, sometimes suddenly crying out. These are all symptoms of a timid and unsettled spirit, and the primary treatment should be to calm the spirit and nourish the energy. Suitable remedies include Xiang Shen Decoction, Tuan Shen Powder, Qifu Drink, and Secret Formula An Shen Pill, among others. If there is mild heat present, Sheng Mai Powder is appropriate; if heat is severe, then Zhu Sha An Shen Pill or Dao Chi Powder should be used. Crying with many tears, suddenly starting and stopping, indicates being startled. If crying occurs without tears, with a long but not loud voice, it suggests abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Clonic spasms, known as &quot;chu,&quot; are a form of fright. When they occur violently, they are termed as frightful convulsions; when occurring mildly and slowly, they are called clonic spasms. If clonic spasms are not treated, they can gradually develop into frightful convulsions. Although the writings of Qian and others discuss the seasons and symptoms of the organs for treatment, the unpredictable nature of illness makes it difficult to be constrained by seasonal factors. Instead, it is better to observe the present symptoms and treat according to the condition of the organs. In summary, for a child&#39;s actual symptoms, the causes relate mainly to excess from the east and stagnation in the center. The excess of the east, due to the wood generating fire and wind, leads to heat and fright. The stagnation of the center, due to earth, generates dampness and stagnation, resulting in phlegm and accumulation. Understanding these two aspects provides insight into treating excess conditions. If a child demonstrates deficiency, it can be manifested in the five organs.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

When the liver is deficient, there will be tense muscles, dry blood, strong spasms, and squinting eyes. When the kidneys are deficient, there will be incontinence, dryness in the armpits, inability to speak, dizziness, limbs feeling cold and reversed, and fire not returning to its source.

By closely observing the physical appearance, voice, pulse, and breath, there will be no situation that cannot be discerned. </p>
<p>For treating excess conditions, one should first address sudden fear; for treating deficiency conditions, one should first address gradual fear. Furthermore, for nighttime crying and other treatment methods, once their essence is fully understood, they should all be examined together.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the complexion is white and the eyes are dark with little brightness, and the child cries at midnight during the Yin phase when Yang is weak, this indicates a deficiency of the liver and kidneys. It is advisable to use Liuwei Dihuang Wan, Bamei Wan, or Liyin Decoction. If the child becomes more agitated upon seeing lights or fire, this indicates heat in the heart. The heart belongs to fire; seeing fire can provoke internal heat, leading to a clash of Yang energies, resulting in the child crying while arching their body. Symptoms include a red face, warm hands and abdomen, and a feeling of heat in the mouth. For mild fire, it is appropriate to use Shengmai San or Daohong San; for strong fire, use Zhusha Anshen Wan or Renshen Huanglian San. If there is considerable heat in the liver and gallbladder, leading to a conflict of wood and fire, Chaihu Qinggan San should be used. Generally, this condition may arise from vomiting or diarrhea, leading to a loss of bodily fluids; or from a congenital deficiency of kidney yin unable to nourish the liver wood; or due to the wet nurse experiencing anger, where liver fire affects the metal.

<p><strong>Convulsion Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Pediatric illnesses, including sudden and chronic convulsions, along with conditions like measles, are among the most severe, as their outcomes may quickly change life and death. A child experiencing convulsions three times is diagnosed with epilepsy, which is a serious condition. Among pediatric concerns, none is more dangerous than the convulsion syndrome. There are three types of convulsions: sudden convulsion, chronic convulsion, and slow spleen wind.</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Signs of Convulsion</strong></p>
<p>When an infant is about to experience a convulsion, signs include an unsettled mind, confusion, fear of others, wide-eyed gazing, looking around nervously, clenching fists, and showing unusual demeanor, all of which are early indicators of convulsion. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes may not exhibit twitching; if there is heat, the eyes may fixate without twitching; if heart heat is present, twitching may occur. This is because both the child and the mother might have excessive heat, causing conflict between wind and fire. Wang states that wood overcomes earth, and heat stirs the heart spirit, leading to convulsions. Qian states that liver wind and heart fire contend, resulting in twitching.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of phlegm convulsions, when the qi flows smoothly, the phlegm transforms and the convulsion stops on its own. Start with Su He Xiang Pill, followed by peppermint decoction mixed with ginger juice, or use Xing Xiang San.<br><strong>Five Symptoms of Fright Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>Fright convulsion is one, and there are distinctions between morning and evening, as well as between exterior and interior conditions. Those with high body heat and strong force represent acute fright, while those with low body temperature and weak force indicate chronic fright. Those who fall silently and spit upon waking represent seizures, those who tilt their heads upward signify &quot;heavenly hanging,&quot; and those with arched backs represent tetanus; the treatment for each differs.<br><strong>Light and Heavy Convulsions</strong></p>
<p>If there are convulsions with arched backs and skewed vision, but the jaw isn&#39;t clenched and there&#39;s no phlegm or saliva, it is mostly due to external factors or internal injuries combined with fright, known as false convulsions, not arising from internal fright seizures. It is advisable to use Shen Su Decoction or Ren Shen Qiang Huo San. Convulsions involving hands and feet pulling, alternating between stretching and contracting, are referred to as severe tetanus. Yan Xiao Zhong stated: &quot;It resembles a convulsion but isn’t severe; this is named tetanus.&quot; Initially, acute fright causes both convulsions and contractions, but over time, convulsions may stop while contractions persist—some urgent, some slow. If only the shoulders move in tetanus, it indicates a lighter case; if there are strong convulsions, it is severe, and contractions indicate greater severity.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Fright</strong></p>
<p>Sudden fright occurs when one is unexpectedly startled; it causes the heart to be shocked and the liver to control wind, leading to muscle and tendon spasms. The liver also governs the sinews, so it is appropriate to use formulas like Tongxin Drink, Xieqing Pill, Liangjing Pill, and Daqing Ointment. Sudden fright arises from hearing unusual sounds or encountering the roar of beasts, resulting in a tight jaw, fierce heat, excessive saliva, wild eye movements, spasms and shaking, heat in the mouth, flushed cheeks and lips, and yellow or red urine, with a pulse that is floating, rapid, forceful, and tense. This condition is due to internal excessive heat, combined with external wind evil, leading to heat accumulation in the heart and shock, while wind arising from the liver causes spasms. The conflict between liver wind and heart fire creates chaos in the blood and qi, leading to phlegm and saliva obstruction. Hence, all the channels are blocked, and the wind-qi thrives without release, resulting in explosive symptoms. </p>
<p>Treatment: Open the channels to disperse the wind and settle the spasms to eliminate phlegm. If there is still heat present, it must be cleared; after relieving it, it is essential to harmonize the stomach and calm the heart, stopping the wind and settling the spasms.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a></p></div>

If phlegm is abundant, one should use Long Wan and Jie Feng Wan. For calming the heart and spirit, it’s appropriate to use Gold Leaf Heart-Calming Pills and Peaceful Heart Ointment.</p>
<p>The so-called Warm Fright Pills, Beneficial Fright Pills, and Cooling Fright Pills indicate that if the condition is deficiency, then use warming; if it is fullness, then use benefiting; if it is heat, then use cooling. This is known as the method of adaptation.</p>
<p>When the symptoms of fright wind are unclear, if it is said to be a Yin condition, the whole body feels warm; if it is a Yang condition, there might be little twitching. This results from not distinguishing between Yin and Yang. It is advisable to use Fang Feng Wen Dan Decoction, along with the Great Fright Pill and Small Fright Pill.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden fright, one should first stabilize the twitching. Twitching comes from wind, and wind arises from heat. Once twitching has started, then heat can be reduced to calm the fright. If the heat does not dissipate, the fright will not disperse either.</p>
<p>For sudden fright, it is crucial to stop the wind and stabilize twitching. Once the wind and twitching are stabilized, one can then reduce heat, and if the heat leaves, the wind will be gone, allowing the twitching to cease.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said in ancient texts: the family of the sick fears being startled but not diarrhea, while the physician fears diarrhea but not being startled. If diarrhea does not stop, one should first treat the diarrhea; if one treats the wind instead, the shock from the wind may worsen.</p>
<p>Diarrhea that is greenish must be treated cautiously for the slow shock, as greenish diarrhea is associated with being startled, where wood overcomes earth. When a child experiences greenish diarrhea, it is due to the spleen being overpowered by the liver, which results in a manifestation of its fundamental essence as a consequence of internal coldness. Thus, the herb astragalus is used to supplement and guide.</p>
<p>For children experiencing slow shock, if there is continuous vomiting and diarrhea transforming into internal wind convulsions, it is not merely wind, but rather a result of the stomach&#39;s energy being nearly exhausted. Use five whole pills of Restore the Essence Dan, crush them into powder, and drink them; the effect will be immediate.</p>
<p>For slow shock, it is advisable to use warming shock pills, miraculous powders, Guanyin powders, whole scorpion Guanyin powders, three-flavor syrup powders, spleen-tonifying decoctions, Baosheng Dan, Yansheng Dan, ginseng and pinellia decoction, Fangfeng pills, and Yinhong powders. When there is abundant saliva, one should use Life-Threatening powders, Double Gold pills, or Nanjing decoction.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Wind from Slow Shock Not Being Treated:</p>
<p>The child may convulse mildly and is sluggish in spirit; the limbs and breath are cold, the eyes remain slightly open during sleep, and there may be stomach pain accompanied by cries resembling crows. This condition is already critical due to weakness in the spleen and stomach. When slow shock appears to be overwhelming, internal phlegm rises and obstructs the throat, causing coarse breathing and a rapid, floating pulse, indicating that yin has become too strong over yang. </p>
<p>One may mistakenly believe that the yang energy has returned and then administer harsh medicines to expel phlegm; as the phlegm descends with the medicine, the medicine along with the phlegm may be eliminated. This leads to blame toward the doctor, as they do not recognize the dangerous signs, and even without administering medicine, there will be no chance of recovery.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>For Acute and Chronic Wind Issues:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the following remedies: Jiumai Pill, Niu Huang Bao Long Pill, Bao Ming Pill, Zhi Sheng Bao Ming Pill, Qian Jin Powder, Xing Xiang Powder, Zhu Fen Powder, Duo Ming Powder, Tan Sheng Powder.</p>
<p><strong>For Slow Spleen Wind:</strong></p>
<p>If the eyes are half-closed, it indicates spleen wind. Observing slow reactions is crucial; if the eyes are dim, that is serious; if vision is obstructed, that is serious; if the limbs are cold, that is serious; if the eyes do not blink, that is serious; blinking without looking around is also serious; if sweat flows like oil, that is serious; if the face suddenly turns dark, that is severe. When the eyes are half-open and half-closed, it signifies a predominance of Yin energy that has penetrated the organs, leading to a deficiency in Yang energy. The spleen meridian is Yin, which thus affects the spleen, hence the term &quot;slow spleen wind.&quot; </p>
<p>For those with half-open and half-closed eyes, one should prepare for treatment of slow spleen wind. Medications for slow spleen wind should be used only when necessary, as the situation is critical, like a lamp running out of oil, gradually dimming. Qian family recommends mixing Jin Ye Dan and Qingzhou Bai Wanzi in equal parts. Administer with a decoction of mint tea, one qian (3 grams), as this reverses wind and restores Yang. </p>
<p>For children, even with a hot head, if the eyes are pale and the feet are cold; even with a hot head, if there is abdominal distension and cold feet; even with a hot head, if there is diarrhea and cold feet; even with a hot head, if there is vomiting and cold feet; even with a hot head, if there is thirst and cold feet. These five symptoms, when accompanied by spasms, are termed slow spleen wind. Quickly administer Bu Pi Yi Zhen Tang with one whole scorpion added, or use Quan Xia Guanyin Powder.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a></p></div>

<p>The body is cold with sticky sweat, lying motionless like a corpse, wheezing with a soft head, a straight back, and closed mouth; head shaking, inability to control bowel movements, lips retracting, and breathing coarse, with phlegm sounding like a saw—this condition is untreatable. If chronic spleen wind is seen with a vital organ failing, medication should not be used. Signs like lack of light in the eyes, black nails, drooping limbs, a cold body, do not require medication.</p>
<p><strong>Heavenly Suspended Sudden Shock</strong></p>
<p>Master Sun said: When traveling far on horseback, one should bathe and change clothes before approaching a baby; otherwise, one may often suffer from sudden illnesses. Qian Zhongyang said: Avoid the foul air of walking in filth near a baby, as it may provoke sudden shock. Heavenly suspension is also a manifestation of sudden shock, but during its onset, the head is tilted back, and there is no sudden shock. This occurs due to the nurse’s excess heat from overfeeding, generating heat in the heart and lungs, compounded by outside wind pathogens; it is advisable to use Nine Dragon Saliva Controlling Powder or Diaoteng Powder. If heat is intense, then the Life-Saving Pill, if phlegm is abundant, use the Baolong Pill. If there’s stooping and tension, swollen external kidneys, urine like rice wash, and red veins or blood spots in the eyes, it indicates blockage by cold; Diaoteng Syrup is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Tremors and Spasms</strong></p>
<p>Tremors and spasms are also types of sudden shock. Tremors are characterized by icy hands and feet, while spasms manifest as rigid body posture. Tremors and spasms are essentially the same condition, differentiated by yang (active) and yin (passive) qualities. The active type has sweat, while the passive type does not. Symptoms include rigid limbs, backward arching of the waist, which are more severe than wind convulsions, and generally not treatable.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>When a person has three sudden seizures due to fright, it is called epilepsy, commonly a serious illness in children. Adults refer to it as &quot;dian&quot; and children as &quot;xian,&quot; though they are essentially the same condition. It is also noted that those over ten years old have &quot;dian&quot; while those under ten have &quot;xian.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sudden epilepsy&quot; manifests as acute fright. During an episode, the person may fall to the ground and make sounds, and upon waking, may drool. In cases of mild or intense fright, they typically do not make sounds or drool. </p>
<p>In an epileptic episode, the person suddenly faints, eyes wide and drooling, showing signs of agitation, limbs convulsing, remaining silent and in a stupor, resembling a state between life and death, sometimes making a harsh cry, but eventually regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>The Qian family&#39;s treatment includes five varieties of epilepsy affecting the five internal organs, using five-colored pills. </p>
<p>The treatment should differentiate between the two main conditions of fright-induced and wind-induced seizures. For fright-related epilepsy, typically arising from accumulated fear, leading to crying and confusion, it is advised to use the Spirit-Settling Pill or the Cenxiang Tianma Decoction. For wind-related seizures, when external pathogens invade and the patient first curls their fingers as if counting before the episode, the Chase-Wind and Eliminate Phlegm Pill is recommended. </p>
<p>For pain related to food, involving interruptions due to fright during dairy consumption causing accumulation, or when there are signs of complications such as foul-smelling stool, the Zisha Pill is advised. </p>
<p>Initially, if there is a hot body, convulsions and crying, it is categorized as yang-type epilepsy, which is easier to treat, suggesting use of the Longnao Anshen Pill or the Clear Heart and Phlegm-Rolling Pill. </p>
<p>Initially, if there is no heat in the body, hands and feet are cool, with no convulsions or crying, it is categorized as yin-type epilepsy, which is more difficult to treat; the five-colored pill should be used to guide the spirit back home. </p>
<p>Due to sudden fright leading to epilepsy, the Five Epilepsy Pill is recommended.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to a fright, one develops seizures. Take the elixir and dissolve one or two pills of mint in soup; recovery follows immediately. There are also cases where a fetus is frightened, leading to seizures, which should be treated with burnt pills.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Sudden rigidity leads to epilepsy. It also says: If evil energy attacks the Yang, it results in epilepsy. The ailment of vertigo arises from insufficient heart qi, with heat accumulating in the chest, and phlegm-heat interacting to stir up wind. The disorder between wind and heart causes confusion and dizziness, hence it is called vertigo. </p>
<p>When phlegm is stagnant in the diaphragm, dizziness is mild and does not lead to fainting. But if phlegm overflows from the diaphragm, dizziness worsens, causing one to fall to the ground and lose awareness, termed epilepsy. Adults refer to it as epilepsy, while children call it seizures, but they are essentially the same. It is said that fainting without awareness is due to evil qi ascending, disrupting the head. </p>
<p>In cases of epilepsy, phlegm and evil qi ascend, causing disorder in the head. A chaotic qi leads to blocked pathways, preventing the openings from functioning properly, resulting in inability to hear sounds or recognize people, leading to confusion and collapse. Since the illness manifests at the crown of the head, it is termed vertex disease.</p>
<p>There are five types of seizures: the liver is associated with the chicken, the heart with the horse, the spleen with the cow, the lungs with the sheep, and the kidneys with the pig, based on the similarity of symptoms. In essence, it is a combination of phlegm, fire, and fright. </p>
<p>Generally, this condition is often caused by phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest; hence, it is necessary to resolve phlegm and calm the spirit. If the spirit is unguarded, leading to nonsensical speech and behavior, persisting for years without recovery, and if the heart gives rise to heat, it is essential to clear the heart and eliminate heat. If phlegm obscures the heart&#39;s orifices, one must remove the phlegm and calm the heart, resorting to significant purging and clearing for recovery.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of epilepsy, during a seizure, the person makes sounds and drools when they awaken, only to have the seizure return intermittently without rest. In contrast, for conditions like stroke, cold, heat, or corpse-like state, the person is silent during the seizure, does not drool when they awaken, and does not have recurrent episodes. </p>
<p>Epilepsy is characterized by abnormalities; those afflicted may speak normally on ordinary days; whereas with seizures, there is often a lack of speech. During a seizure, the person may groan, and in severe cases, they might stiffen and stare blankly, experiencing a persistent feeling of unhappiness, speaking incoherently, behaving as if drunk or dazed. </p>
<p>Seizures involve sudden loss of consciousness, teeth clenching, making sounds, drooling, and a complete loss of awareness, followed by awakening. For those experiencing petit mal seizures, it is advisable to use pill formulations for treatment. If the pulse is strong and hot (yang), use the Miaoxiang pills; if cool and deep (yin), use the Wusheng pills. For those who are overweight with phlegm, it is best to use the Chasing Wind and Expelling Phlegm pills, the Jiawei Shouxing pills, or the Yinshi Guizhe Dan. For slender individuals with excess heat, use the Qingxin Gun Fan pills or the Longnao Anshen pills. </p>
<p>If phlegm obstructs the heart orifices, employ the Jinfan Zhenxin pills or the Kongyan pills. If both phlegm and fire are strong, use the Gansui San to induce vomiting and purging. If the seizures are due to fright, use the Jingqi pills or the Baolong pills. If caused by anger, use the Ningshen Daotan decoction or the Danggui Longhui pills. For a weak heart with insufficient qi and blood, employ the Ziyin Ningshen decoction, the Qingxin Wendan decoction, or the Guishen Dan. </p>

<p><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Longdan Decoction</strong> (from &quot;Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold&quot;) </p>
<p>This is for treating infants who have just been born, with excessive blood and qi, experiencing alternating chills and fevers, sudden spasms in their limbs, high fever, and severe vomiting. If the infant is able to breastfeed but is unable to digest, suffering from excessive heat that transforms into steaming and can&#39;t be relieved, along with symptoms of ghostly influences and all types of epilepsy, this formula is fully applicable. All children under ten years old can take this. The Longdan Decoction for infants is the primary formula for newborns. For those who grow according to the sun and moon cycles, follow accordingly as an example. If it is necessary to know about ghostly influences and qi, you can add ginseng and angelica, adjusting the amount of Longdan accordingly: for a baby one hundred days old, add three golds; for two hundred days, six golds; for one year old, half a tael; the rest of the herbs are measured in the same way. </p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Longdan, Diao Teng Pi (Vine bark), Chai Hu (Bupleurum), Huang Qin (Scutellaria), Jie Geng (Platycodon), Shao Yao (Peony), Fu Ling (Poria), Gan Cao (Licorice), each six golds; two scarabs; one tael of Da Huang (Rhubarb). </p>
<p>Preparation: Chop the ten ingredients and boil them with one liter of water, reducing it to five cups as the dosage. The method of administration is as follows: for infants born to seven days old, divide one cup into three doses; for those born between eight and fifteen days, divide one and a half cups into three doses; for those born between sixteen and twenty days, divide two cups into three doses; for those born between twenty and thirty days, divide three cups into three doses; for those born between thirty and forty days, use all five cups divided into three doses. Administer until results are seen and do not continue further.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Mortality Powder</strong><br>From &quot;Tang&#39;s Infants&#39; Treasure Formula&quot;  </p>
<p>For treating urgent and chronic convulsions in children, phlegm and saliva obstructing the throat, where life is at stake, this drug descends the phlegm and is a sacred remedy for convulsions due to phlegm.<br>1 tael of genuine limestone, 0.5 taels of nitre.  </p>
<p>Grind them together into a powder. Take half a qian or one qian per dose. For acute phlegm heat related to convulsions, use mint and schizonepeta soup, mixed with raw honey to take. For chronic convulsions due to spleen deficiency, use cardamom soup mixed with cooked honey to take. Although limestone and nitre effectively resolve phlegm, they are not suitable if caused by weak spleen and stomach.  </p>
<p>Wang Keng-Tang says: This medicine has great power to control phlegm and saliva. Regardless of acute or chronic convulsions, with phlegm swelling and blocking the throat, creating a sound like tides, termed &quot;tide saliva,&quot; where no medicine can pass, and life is at stake, first use this medicine to enter the throat, and phlegm will immediately descend, functioning perfectly, seizing the essence of nature.  </p>
<p>He also states: For acute convulsions with phlegm obstructing upwards, and a body temperature like fire, use fresh mint juice mixed with honey to take warm. After a long while, the medicine will wrap the phlegm which will then descend and be expelled like thick mucus, this is the effect of the medicine; then take other heat-dispelling and convulsion-stopping drugs.  </p>
<p>For chronic convulsions also with phlegm and saliva rising, blocking the throat so that food and medicine cannot enter, doctors are at a loss, waiting for the condition to pass, just use this medicine, grinding white pills from Qingzhou into a powder, boil them into a thin paste, and mix with cooked honey to take, which will cause the saliva to descend into the stomach; subsequently, take medicines like flower snake, chuanwu, whole scorpion, centipede, etc.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a></p></div>

Take twenty balls each time, consuming them with ginseng soup; stone calamus and ophiopogon soup can also be used. According to experience, for children with convulsions, use Zuiyan powder.

If there is constipation, thirst for cold drinks, and normal appetite, it suggests a tangible illness; this should be treated with laxatives. If the bowel movements are regular, thirst for cold drinks, and the eyes are a light blue color, this indicates a tangible illness with weak vitality; in such a case, use Yiping pills to stabilize.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the stools are not solid, one should drink soup for thirst, eat less, and feel fatigue in the limbs, indicating a condition of deficiency. It is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to supplement. If there is wind generated by blood deficiency in the liver channel, first use Si Wu Tang with added Dao Teng Gou to nourish the liver blood, and then use Si Jun Zi Tang to tonify the spleen. If phlegm arises from dryness of the liver blood, use Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water and benefit liver blood. If the earth cannot nourish the wood, use Si Jun Zi Tang with added Dang Gui to supplement the center, and Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys. If the lung metal restrains the liver wood, use Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Shao Yao and Mu Xiang to solidify the spleen earth and balance the lung metal. If the heart is deficient and deprives the mother’s qi, or if kidney water is deficient and cannot generate the liver wood, Di Huang Wan should be used to address it. If one frequently takes harsh medicines resulting in deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach, one must use Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Ding Xiang and Mu Xiang to tonify the spleen and stomach to support yang qi. If a nursing mother experiences anger and causes liver fire to act recklessly, affecting the child, add flavor to Xiao Chai Hu Tang for the child. If the nursing mother has liver and spleen blood deficiency with fever, affecting the child, she should take an enhanced Xiao Yao San, and the child should also take a few drops.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 qian of melon dung root</li>
<li>1 qian of white sweetwormwood</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be lightly roasted over a slow fire until yellow and then ground into a powder. Each dose is 2-3 fen, taken with a decoction of mint and musk. Xue Ji explains: According to Xu Yongcheng, Qian’s treatment for gradual fright uses melon soup, fearing that there may be transcription errors. This is because fright is primarily due to the wind element, associated with the Yang of wood; acute conditions are easy to treat, while chronic conditions are difficult. Moreover, children’s internal organs are not fully developed, and when they experience gradual fright, it is not a result of post-illness or vomit and diarrhea leading to spleen and stomach deficiency. Thus, be cautious with such harsh remedies.</p>
<p>Wang Keng Tang adds: The melon soup on the right is a method by Qian for treating gradual fright, suitable for those with a strong pulse. This condition is caused by damp phlegm accumulating in the diaphragm, preventing wind and fire from resolving, leading to a cold body; hence the use of melon soup to eliminate damp phlegm allows wind and fire to manifest, warming and halting spasms. If the pulse is weak, it is inappropriate to use this; instead, one should supplement the spleen and apply warming formulas like Warming Fright Pill or similar remedies.</p>
<p><strong>Warming Fright Pill</strong>: Treats symptoms of gradual fright. Also known as Pink Powder Pill.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 liang of dried southern star (Nux vomica) powder, mixed with ox bile and air-dried for 100 days.</li>
<li>1.5 qian of cinnabar</li>
<li>1 liang of safflower</li>
<li>0.5 qian of raw lip pigment</li>
<li>5 fen of dragon brain (benzoin), ground separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mixture should be made into pills the size of a chicken head; each dose is one pill, or half a pill for smaller children, taken with sugar water. Xue Ji states: Gradual fright is attributed to deficiency of the spleen and stomach Yang, with cold from the liver, hence Warming Fright Pill is used to warm it. However, the herbs included are primarily spicy and disperse Yang Qi to eliminate phlegm, and the practitioner should assess accordingly.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a></p></div>

<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>4 taels of White Atractylodes (Bai Zhu)</li>
<li>2 taels of roasted Licorice (Gan Cao)</li>
<li>1.5 taels of processed Aconite (Fu Zi), peeled and with the seed removed</li>
</ul>
<p>Method: Grind the above into a fine powder, then add Aconite. For each dose, take 3 qian, along with 5 slices of ginger and 1 jujube, and decoct in water for consumption.</p>
<p>Xue Ji states: &quot;In my humble opinion, Aconite warms the center and restores yang; it is the premier medicine for the spleen&#39;s slow function.

Use pieces weighing around 1.5 to 2.4 qian, regular and flat with a shape resembling a lotus flower; otherwise, they resemble poisonous black Aconite.&quot;</p>
<p>Preparation method: Cut off the pointed ends and soak in child&#39;s urine for a specified period—7 days in autumn and winter, and 5 days in spring and summer, changing the urine daily. After soaking, cut into four pieces, wrap them in several layers of damp paper, and gently simmer for half a day. After removal, cut open; if there are no white specks, it is prepared correctly. If needed urgently, process until cracks form, then immediately soak in child’s urine for an extended period, slice once fully soaked, and if the color is white, lightly roast again.

<p>Grind these into a powder and form into pills the size of a mung bean using aged rice porridge. Take 2 to 3 pills with peppermint tea. Xue Ji comments: This formulation treats epilepsy, convulsions, and reduces phlegm accumulation. The use of Qian Niu and caster bean is intended to break the firm masses of phlegm and fluids. As the ancient Zhang states, it is like a general who seizes the strategic points in battle; it should be used only when symptoms are substantial, as it indeed has the power to restore life. Careful examination is essential; do not act rashly.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

<p>The ingredients are: Qianghuo, Ren Shen (ginseng), Chuanxiong, Bai Fu Ling (white artemisia), and red Fu Ling (poria) each five qian; Ming Tian Ma (gastrodia) one liang; Bai Jiang Can (silkworm) roasted with wine, Gan Xie (scorpion) fried to remove toxins, and Bai Hua She (white flower snake meat) soaked and baked in wine; Xiong Huang (realgar) and Chen Sha (cinnabar) each ground separately, one fen; Fu Zi (prepared aconite) fried; Fang Feng (siler), Ma Huang (ephedra), Rou Dou Kou (nutmeg), Ji She Xiang (chicken tongue fragrant), Huo Xiang (agastache), Chen Xiang (aloeswood), and Mu Xiang (costus) each two qian; Qing Fen (light powder), Zhen Zhu (pearls), and Niu Huang (cattle bile) each one and a half qian; Long Nao (camphor) two fen; and She Xiang (musk) one qian, each ground separately.</p>
<p>These are to be made into a powder, refined with honey into pills the size of a broad bean. Each dose is one or two pills taken with mint decoction or Mai Dong (ophiopogon) decoction. Note that this formula is hot in nature, with strong heat, and should not be given during acute fright. </p>
<p>Xue Ji says: According to the ingredients in this formula, they are quite miscellaneous. If it is indeed due to spleen deficiency causing chronic fright, caution must be exercised in using it, as it may disperse true qi and severely damage yin and blood.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p></div>

<p>Danxi stated: The Baolong Pills are for the heart, lungs, and liver. &quot;Bao&quot; means to protect; &quot;Long&quot; refers to the liver. The liver is the mother, and the heart is the child; if the mother is at peace, the child is at peace. Moreover, the heart houses the spirit, and the liver houses the soul. Once the spirit and soul are settled, where can fright arise?</p>
<p>Xue Ji noted: The main functions of this pill are to resolve phlegm, expel evil, and clear heat, especially effective for conditions arising from excess heat in the liver and heart. However, if the spleen and lungs are weak, leading to drowsiness and phlegmy cough, then the Baojian Tianma Powder should be used to replenish the vital energy.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Wan family said: Strong and healthy children should use it. However, within it contains medicinal substances like male red gold stone that cannot be consumed. For instance, musk consumes true vitality and can draw in the wind evil, much like oil cannot be expelled once it enters the skin. Therefore, everyone forbids it and does not use it lightly. Wang Kengtang said: For the medicine mentioned, for infants of a hundred days, each pill is divided into three or four doses; for five-year-olds, one or two pills; for adults, three to five pills. It also treats white discharge in young girls; for summer heat, chew a small amount of salt with one or two pills and swallow with freshly drawn water. Boiling snow water in the twelfth month, combined with licorice and the medicine, is especially good. One method involves soaking southern star root in rice water or fresh water for three days until it is translucent, then boiling it softly for three to five times, taking it out, cutting off the skin while soft, only taking the white soft part, thinly slicing it, drying it out, and roasting it until yellow. Take eight taels of this powder, with two and a half taels of licorice smashed, use two bowls of water to soak overnight, then slowly boil until half a bowl remains, remove the dregs, and gradually pour the southern star powder into it while slowly grinding, ensuring the licorice water is fully absorbed before adding the remaining medicine.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A brown scorpion is ground finely, mixed with a small amount of realgar and musk, and prepared with peppermint tea to make a dose. This is effective for several years. The reason is that epilepsy is caused by the stagnation of heart blood, and the scorpion helps control the blood. After this, continue with Er Chen Tang. If scorpions are unavailable, use the blood of a male wild boar instead. Adding daizhi stone powder is particularly wonderful.</p>
<p>Daizhi Stone Powder treats both yin and yang epilepsy. The daizhi stone is calcined, rinsed with vinegar, ground into powder, and then water-floated and dried. This becomes the powder, and each dose is taken with half a qian, decocted with gold and silver, mixed with gold foil and silver foil, taken in two doses. If there are red spots on the shins, that indicates the evil qi is releasing, and it can be treated; if there are no red spots, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Huafeng Dan cools wind, dispels phlegm, reduces heat, and calms convulsions. It consists of two qian of cattle gall, Nánxīng, Qianghuo, Duhuo, Fangfeng, Tianma, Ginseng, Chuanxiong, Jingjie, and one qian each of powdered grass, with a whole scorpion. Grind the ingredients into powder, make honey pills the size of a soapberry, and take one qian with peppermint tea. If whole scorpion is unavailable, substitute with licorice and Xixin. If adding, include cinnabar and musk.</p>
<p>Fushen Tang treats deficiency and cold of the gallbladder qi, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and fear, and those who cannot be alone or may have fright-induced epilepsy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Prepare a decoction with one mouthful of the medicine and one large cup of water, simmer until reduced to half a cup, strain, and consume regularly. Adding white peony root is especially beneficial. These three ingredients are all sweet and warm, capable of replenishing vital energy. Sweetness can clear heat. The Inner Canon states: when heat is excessive within, it should be mitigated with sweetness and contained with sourness. White peony root is sour and cool, which can also clear heat; its sour flavor can drain the liver while greatly nourishing the lungs, thereby enhancing both metal and earth energies. When fire is deficient, how can wind and wood overcome the earth? Thus, expel the邪 of wind. Formulas like Yao Huang San, Li Zhong Wan, and Yang Shen Wan are all excellent remedies for conditions of excessive cold dampness in the spleen and stomach. If heat dynamic is trapped within the spleen and stomach due to insufficient effort and one takes hot medicines like ba dou, it can lead to a weak stomach and chronic shock syndrome, which can be harmful. Chronic shock is always due to a prolonged weakening of the spleen and stomach. Qian&#39;s method using Qiang Huo ointment to treat chronic shock has proven effective. For those with spleen deficiency, fire pathogens take advantage of their earth&#39;s position, which is why this condition is called “virtual邪.” When fire is strong, it can bolster wood, and when wood is abundant, it can attack the earth. Therefore, in heart conditions, one should sweetly and warmly nourish the source of earth, while in the spleen, drain heat with cool sweetness and fortify metal with sour cold, leading to a strong metal and weak fire in the spleen, thus alleviating the wind and wood. Reducing food intake and increasing medicinal consumption will lead to self-recovery; the aforementioned medicines can aid in this.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a></p></div>

<p>This remedy is for children experiencing fright, seasonal wind and cold, excessive phlegm and heat, leading to restlessness and agitation, as well as coughing and difficulty breathing, and when rashes are about to erupt. It is also suitable for their treatment.</p>
<p>Ingredients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genuine amber: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Turmeric: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Finely powdered sandalwood: 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Ginseng (peeled): 1.5 taels</li>
<li>White poria (peeled): 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Fresh licorice: 3 taels (cut to remove joints)</li>
<li>Bitter orange peel (roasted): 1 tael</li>
<li>Bitter orange (soaked in water, roasted until slightly yellow): 1 tael</li>
<li>Chinese yam (peeled, cut into small pieces, stir-fried over low heat until thoroughly heated): 1 pound</li>
<li>Noxious star (shredded): 1 tael (fermented with sulfur and cow bile over the summer)</li>
<li>Cinnabar: 5 taels (first use a magnet to remove iron filings, then grind in a mortar to remove floating impurities; clarify in a clean container and drain excess water, following this process to refine it until pure, then dry for use)</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the final powdered medicine (1 tael) with 100 sheets of gold leaf, grind together very finely in a mortar, blend with the previous mixture, then form into pills the size of green peas using fresh well water, and air-dry. Each dose should be taken with mint decoction.</p>
<p>Amber Dragon Ball contains nourishing ingredients that everyone appreciates. However, the two ingredients, bitter orange peel and bitter orange, can disperse stagnant energy. For those without stagnant energy, they may weaken the vital energy in the chest. In cases of chronic fright or weakened vital energy, these two ingredients should be reduced; they can be replaced with 2 taels each of angelica and chuanxiong.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When preparing the medicinal formula, if one ingredient is missing and it does not follow the established standards, it will surely be ineffective. Always use a ceramic bottle to combine with musk, to prevent the scent from dissipating. Mix in one tael of pearl powder, called &quot;Golden Pearl Powder.&quot; Pearls can calm the heart and soothe the liver, particularly effective for expelling phlegm. The method of preparation is the same as before. Moreover, the meaning of &quot;embracing the dragon&quot; is to protect, with the dragon representing the liver. The liver corresponds to the eastern azure dragon of wood; wood generates fire, which symbolizes the nurturing parents. The liver is the mother, and the heart is the child; if the mother is stable, so shall the child be peaceful. The heart stores the spirit, and the liver stores the soul; if the spirit and soul are settled, where can anxiety arise? Thus, it is said that &quot;Embracing Dragon Pill&quot; treats various disturbances in children, such as seasonal colds from wind and cold, warm epidemic heat causing restlessness, phlegm cough with breathlessness, and prevention of emerging sores and rashes, all suitable for administration. Its medicinal nature is warm and balanced, not harsh or drying.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Baolong Pill</strong>: The word &quot;hold&quot; refers to nurturing. The dragon represents pure Yang energy; it corresponds to thunder and is associated with the wood of the east, symbolizing the energy of lesser Yang. When spring arrives, it marks the beginning of the emergence of all things. The character &quot;Yi&quot; represents the liver and wood, with the liver governing wind and embodying the image of a newborn child, which is pure Yang without Yin. The liver is characterized by excess, and the energy of lesser Yang is strong. The liver governs wind; when children are ill, they may experience heat, and heat can give rise to wind. A skilled physician considers this, creating this formula to balance the liver wood and prevent convulsions; hence, the name &quot;hold the dragon.&quot; This medicine is essential for children to nourish their Yin and support them, ensuring balance. Furthermore, the azure dragon corresponds to the liver wood, and as children&#39;s livers often have excess while their spleens are generally deficient, this medicine curbs the liver and strengthens the spleen, thus named &quot;hold the dragon.&quot; It treats conditions of strong heat, drowsiness with coarse breath, or coughs caused by phlegm and convulsions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to treat children with deficiencies in the spleen and stomach, where the Earth is defeated and the Wood dominates, observe if the eyes are slightly moving, the limbs are slightly twitching, or if there are alternating fevers.

</ul>
<p>This mixture is ground into a powder and made into pills the size of soybeans, to be taken with light ginger tea, three to five pills each time. </p>
<p>Xue Ji states: In my humble opinion, this formula fundamentally aims at treatment and prevention. However, it contains many bitter, cold, and acrid ingredients which may be harmful if used lightly after illness, as they could damage the stomach&#39;s energy and lead to other ailments. If there are symptoms arising from food stagnation, the main focus should be on elimination. If there are symptoms due to damage to the spleen and stomach, the emphasis should be on strengthening the middle energy. Generally speaking, if the vital energy has not yet recovered after illness, or if it has been further harmed by purging remedies, the focus should be on promoting and replenishing the yang energy, allowing symptoms to self-resolve, as targeting the illness directly may lead to errors.<a id="trans-247p" href="#orig-247p" class="marker">[247p]</a></p></div>

<p>Wang Kentang said: It treats children&#39;s liver channel deficiency and internal heat, blood dryness, or conditions caused by wind and dampness, resulting in scrofula or tuberculosis, twitching of limbs, eye spasms, and phlegm rising. It also addresses kidney deficiency symptoms like brain heat, body emaciation, cold hands and feet, alternation of cold and heat, diarrhea, abdominal distension, bad breath, dry thirst, gum sores, dark nails, and facial pallor. This may also include sores on the body and ears, ear discharge, fever, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, blood in stools, and loss of voice, among other symptoms, which cannot all be described.</p>

<p>Directions: Grind the above ingredients, taking one qian (a unit of weight) for each dose, with half a cup of water, two slices of ginger, and half a date.

Immediately lie on her back for a moment to let the medicine enter the milk channels, then let the baby suck a few times but do not let it become overly full; this is the correct method. </p>
<p>If vomiting persists for a day, it is urgent to dispel wind by taking Ba Xian San. Two days later, it is advisable to follow with Xiang Pi San. If none of the previous medicines work and there is danger, one must check the Tai Chong pulse to see if it is not completely closed and then should moxibustion on the Baihui point. The point is located at the midpoint between the hairline at the front and the tips of both ears.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states that it only mentions the top of the head with spiral hair, but does not explain the existence of double tops or irregular spirals. Many mediocre physicians, adhering to old texts, often mislead people. After moxibustion, one should control saliva using a powder made from Qingzhou white pills; after simmering it to a thin paste, mix in refined honey and a lethal powder, which will eventually help salivation. Finely grind spirit sand and mix it with rice drink to apply in the mouth, gradually observing the retreat of symptoms. If there&#39;s a strong wind, take Eight Immortals Powder; if feeling drowsy, use Wake the Spleen Powder. Regularly reducing mother’s milk and having the mother take fermented milk medicine, this form of regulation leads to recovery for everyone. However, if there is a deficiency in constitution or if the five elements are imbalanced, even skilled practitioners may not overpower destiny. If the saliva has already left the diaphragm and is stuck in the throat like a saw, medications cannot enter and cannot be controlled; alternative methods must be used to stimulate its release, alongside inducing sneezing through the nose, and then taking the lethal powder to avoid recurrence.<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a></p></div>

Grind them into a powder, mix them uniformly. Use a chicken feather to dab the medicine and insert it into the throat, gradually withdrawing it while frequently using a cloth to wipe.

For critical cases, one should apply moxibustion to Baihui and the phlegm-lifting method, but for Duoming, use lunstone. For those with deficient qi, it&#39;s challenging to use; must be combined with Dongyuan&#39;s Yihuang Powder. Chen said: For treating chronic fright wind, first use Xiongxie Powder to manually expel cold phlegm and cold salivation, so that one won&#39;t be delirious; then take Youzhu Ointment; afterward, take Yizhen Decoction to warm and strengthen the original qi; occasionally take the previous Pusa Powder to relieve excess above and deficiency below.<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a></p></div>

<p>Grind the above into a fine powder. Use a copper coin&#39;s worth for a child, mixed with some boiling water to warm it, or use mint soup, and administer on an empty stomach. If phlegm fills the chest and throat, with the eyeballs cross-eyed, administer quickly. If the eyes are fixed and unresponsive, recovery is difficult. If phlegm and gas are obstructing and ingestion of medicine is impossible, use a finger to probe into the child&#39;s throat and soft palate to remove the phlegm, allowing for slight relief. Next, use the Bushi Yizhen Decoction, or select Oil Pearl Ointment. This formula has saved many lives throughout the ages.</p>

<p>This remedy treats both acute and chronic wind-induced convulsions, umbilical wind that causes mouth spasms, clenched jaws, excessive pain and saliva, and swollen, painful throats. </p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wei Ling Xian (Some type of herb, 1.5 taels), finely ground and roasted until dry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 3 taels of soap pod, remove the skin and strings, pound it, and then mix with one bowl of warm water. Filter through silk, and simmer over low heat until it becomes a thin paste. </li>
<li>Add half a tael of strong vinegar, simmer for another three to five boils, remove from heat, cool it down, and mix the prepared herbal powder evenly in a mortar, forming pills the size of a chestnut. </li>
<li>First, rub the roots of the teeth with salt and plum meat; then take one or two pills, mix with warm, concentrated white soup, and apply into both sides of the jaws until they open; continue with other medicines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: When boiling, the use of earthenware is preferred; silver is even better. For phlegm stagnation, use light ginger soup for dissolution, administered at any time. For swollen and painful throat, drink warm tea or light lotus leaf soup. </p>
<p>These methods are effective for treating both acute and chronic wind conditions, addressing both deficiency and excess, hence the method for universal treatment. In summary, despite the distinctions between acute and chronic, both stem from phlegm, thus remedies related to stones, stars, and half can universally treat the conditions. </p>
<p>When it comes down to specifics, substances related to stones help eliminate phlegm, those with indigo relieve wood-related blockages, and cinnabar addresses fire-related issues, all are effective against Qi stagnation. Ginseng and licorice help tonify the earth, while Tianma and whole scorpion nourish wood, and black and Aconite root nourish fire; all serve to remedy Qi deficiency. Therefore, a combination of reinforcement and draining is effective in treating both deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-310p" href="#orig-310p" class="marker">[310p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the Treatise on Pain: Fear causes qi to descend, leading to weakness of essence and blockage of the upper jiao. It is said: &quot;What ascends from below should be drawn out.&quot; The Qianghuo and Du Huo are slightly warm and bitter, which helps to raise the yang and promote ascending qi, entering the Taiyang meridian. Therefore, they are designated as the monarch herbs. Tianma and Fangfeng are spicy and warm, which disperse, while Angelica and Licorice are spicy, sweet, and warm, replenishing the deficiency of qi and blood, and nourishing the stomach qi, hence they are designated as minister herbs. Black Aconite, Chuanwu, and Job&#39;s Tears are very spicy and warm, promoting yang and expelling yin, also treating cold damage to the stomach, acting as assistants. The kidneys govern fluids and enter the spleen as phlegm, hence fresh ginger and Banxia are used to dry dampness and transform phlegm. The ten doses proposed can remove fear, and Agarwood is spicy and warm, heavy in nature, clearing qi, dispelling fright, thus it is designated as the envoy herb. The harmonious combination of flavors raises the yang and nourishes the stomach, calming the qi of fear, restoring balance.<a id="trans-324p" href="#orig-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wind affects the body from head to toe, causing seizures with the mouth closed tight and the abdomen distended with feces that cannot be expelled. Pressing on it does not alleviate the discomfort, leading to sadness and panting, and this is governed by Kunlun. </p>
<p>In &quot;Qianjin Fang,&quot; Sun Simiao of the Tang dynasty states that a newborn child should never be subjected to reverse acupuncture. If done in reverse, the child will endure pain, disturbing the flow of the five vessels, which may lead to seizures. The land in the He and Luo regions is cold, and children are prone to convulsions; often, reverse acupuncture is used to prevent this. Additionally, moxibustion on the cheeks is used to prevent locking of the jaw. In cases of jaw locking, the pulse under the tongue is rapid, and the muscles in the teeth are tense. The cold conditions of the land lead to bleeding under the tongue and moxibustion on the cheeks to prevent jaw locking. In the warmer regions of Wu and Shu, this condition does not occur. </p>
<p>The ancient methods have been passed down, but modern practitioners do not pay attention to the differences between the north and south, resulting in harm to many children. Therefore, peasant children are allowed to grow naturally without dying prematurely. </p>
<p>When a child is shocked and cries, their limbs may twitch in sleep, and if they have not resolved the prior steam condition, do not perform acupuncture on their claws, as this could disturb the hundred vessels and lead to seizures. Only in cases of yin-type seizures and jaw locking is it acceptable to use acupuncture on the claws. In general, when moxibustion is applied for seizures, it should first be done to induce a state of deficiency in the child, and then the moxibustion is applied when the child is in a state of emptiness. If moxibustion is applied when the child is still solid, it can create a blockage in the qi both front and back, which could be fatal.<a id="trans-359p" href="#orig-359p" class="marker">[359p]</a></p></div>

<p>For the twelve points on the right abdomen—the chest area, Jueque, and the stomach conduit—apply moxibustion three times for children under ten days old and five times for those over a month. In the region above the genitals, three times may be suitable, or some say according to age.</p>
<p>If there is a strong curvature in the spine, moxibustion should be applied to the Dazhui point and to the associated organ points along the spine centrally. The Dazhui can be measured down to the base of the spine; from the Dazhui point, continue measuring downwards to perform moxibustion at the top of the spine.</p>
<p>For the twelve points on the right back, children under ten days should receive moxibustion three times, and those over a month can have it five times.</p>
<p>If there are spasms in the hands and feet or if there is shock, perform moxibustion on the Chi Ze point, followed by the Yangming point, then on the Shaoshang, upon the Laoguan, on the Xin Zhu point, at the Hegu point, and lastly on the three Intersections. </p>

Moxibustion for diarrhea is also effective. The &quot;Complete Book of Pediatrics&quot; states: whenever acute convulsions occur with the jaw clenched and unresponsive, immediately use moxa on the middle fingers of both hands, bringing them together to apply the heat, which will awaken the child, after which treatment can be administered. First, bring the thumbs together and burn one or two moxa sticks at the lateral edges of the nails; then, bring the middle fingers together and burn one or two moxa sticks at the center of the nail seams to awaken them. If there is no reaction to the moxibustion, do not administer treatment. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: for acute fright in children, needle the small point. For fright with crying, do moxibustion at the Baihui point, or needle the Shenmen point with three-tenths and do three strong moxibustions. For chronic fright in children, do moxibustion at the Shizhe and Yintang points with three strong applications each: Shizhe is found in the hollow above the elbow crease along the transverse elbow line, where the Taiyin Lung meridian enters, to relieve lung excess.<a id="trans-366p" href="#orig-366p" class="marker">[366p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The book by Qian on pediatric diagnosis states: &quot;In the residence of the Qian family, regarding the case of the seven-year-old Tawei Fang, who had been suffering from tidal fever for several days and wanted to recover, Qian told his father, the Great King, &#39;The seventh (method) will cure the tidal fever, but the eighth (method) is for preventing convulsions.&#39; The king was angry, saying: &#39;Only let the seventh cure him; do not speak of the eighth causing sickness.&#39; Qian replied: &#39;The eighth method will surely occur tomorrow at noon without suffering.&#39; The next day, before noon, convulsions indeed appeared, leading to an urgent call for Qian to treat him, and he recovered in three days. He foresaw that the child’s eyes were straight and his cheeks were red, indicating that both the liver and heart were overheated. He then sat on a stone stool seeking coolness; this heat was excessive. Also, the skin was plump and firm, and the pulse was rapid, hence the convulsions emerged. He explained that noon refers to the time from the tiger (3 AM) to noon, when the heart and liver are most active; thus, treatment involved draining the heart and liver while tonifying the kidneys, leading to peace.&quot;</p>
<p>In another case, Li Sihu’s grandson experienced convulsions a hundred days after birth, occurring three to five times a day. Treatment was given for fetal fright but did not yield results. Therefore, he used large blue ointment and applied it to the forehead and utilized bathing methods, leading to recovery in three days. This was because the infant&#39;s blood and qi were not yet substantial enough to withstand external evils, resulting in convulsions, thus the necessity of the bathing method. Generally, for frequent convulsions, it is easy to treat if wind is on the surface, and dispersal is recommended; for rare convulsions, it is challenging if wind is internal, hence it is advised to tonify the spleen.</p>
<p>In the case of Zhu Jian&#39;s five-year-old son, who experienced fever at midnight, upon waking, he returned to his usual state. Cooling medicine was given to resolve it, but he ended up producing excessive saliva and enjoyed sleep, with stools being green and white, exhibiting thirst and a desire for drink. The physician said: &quot;This should strengthen the spleen and stomach, allowing the symptoms to recede.&quot; Consequently, a dose of Bai Zhu San (Atractylodes powder) was prepared with one tael of water, and he was allowed to drink two doses. He improved slightly, and after three doses, his thirst ceased and saliva diminished; further doses of Ejiao San were given, and the child settled down.<a id="trans-372p" href="#orig-372p" class="marker">[372p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The son of the Xu family, three years old, suffered from tidal fever. Every day at the hour of You (5-7 PM), he experienced convulsions, had a slight fever, and his eyes were slightly turned and showed the whites. His limbs were cold, and he wheezed, with his stool being slightly yellow. The family consulted Qian and Li for treatment. Qian asked Li, “What causes the convulsions?” Li replied, “There is wind.” “Why is there a slight fever?” asked Qian. Li said, “It is due to the condition of the limbs.” “Why are the eyes turned and the whites showing?” asked Qian. Li answered, “Convulsions cause the eyes to turn.” “Why are the limbs cold?” Qian inquired. Li responded, “It is cold contraction with internal heat.” “What about the wheezing?” asked Qian. Li said, “It is due to severe convulsions.” “How shall we treat it?” Qian asked. Li said, “Administer Liangjing pills through the nose; it will certainly stop the convulsions.” </p>
<p>Qian further questioned, “Since you say it is a wind illness, with warmth causing convulsions, eyes turned with whites showing, internal heat with cold limbs, and severe convulsions causing wheezing, what medicine will treat all of these?” Li replied, “It is all treated with this medicine.” Qian insisted, “That can’t be right. The convulsions indicate a strong heart and liver; the slight fever signifies the lung functioning at sunset. The lungs govern warmth; the current warmth indicates lung deficiency. The eyes slightly turned and the whites showing indicate a conflict between the liver and lungs. The cold limbs indicate spleen deficiency. If the lungs are very deficient, then the spleen is also weak. Wood energy overwhelms the spleen, causing the limbs to become cold. To treat it, we must first tonify the spleen and lungs using Yi Huang powder and Ejiao powder, which will reduce the spleen deficiency before addressing the heart and liver with Xie Qing pills and Dao Chi powder. The Liangjing pills will treat it.” After nine days, the child recovered.<a id="trans-373p" href="#orig-373p" class="marker">[373p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The prince&#39;s son, five years old, stared straight ahead and did not desire food. Some believed it was a ghostly disturbance and sprayed him with magical water, which only worsened his condition, leading to convulsions. This was a sign of excessive heat in the liver channel, and he was treated with Qingxian pills and recovered.</p>
<p>The son of the Wang family suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, and when medication was given, he slept with his eyes open, and his body felt cold, which indicated chronic fright. Using a bottle gourd soup treated him, and his eyes opened and his body warmed. However, his urination and defecation were not smooth; thus, Ba Zheng powder was administered. If he was still cold and refused food, he was treated with Yihuang powder and Shijunzi pills to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach, and all symptoms resolved. Later, he became mute, and Sheng Di Huang pills were used to tonify the kidneys, and he recovered in half a month.</p>
<p>The son of Li Siling, three years old, had convulsions from the hour of Yin to the hour of Si, looking to the right and crying aloud. Qian Jian said, &quot;This is a reversal.&quot; As a boy represents yang, normally he would look to the left in silence, which signifies a smooth condition; looking to the right with a sound signifies a reversal. This is because the liver belongs to wood on the left and the lungs to metal on the right. A reversal indicates conflict between these organs, resulting in the sound. Treatment should aim to drain the strong and nourish the weak. </p>
<p>For example, if a girl has convulsions and looks to the left, it suggests the lungs are disturbing the liver, which cannot tolerate it, thus causing the crying. In this case, the lung should be drained, and then the heart and liver treated subsequently. If the disease arises in the fall (during a similar time in the west), when the lungs are in a dominant position, the lungs should be strongly drained. If the disease occurs in spring (during the same time in the morning), when the liver is dominant, it cannot subdue the lungs, meaning the lungs are strong and the liver fire weak. Therefore, the liver and kidneys should be nourished while draining the lungs. If a boy has convulsions and looks to the right, it indicates the liver is overpowering the lungs and causing the crying, so the liver and heart should be drained.<a id="trans-374p" href="#orig-374p" class="marker">[374p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the illness occurs in spring or summer, during the morning or midday when the liver and heart are strong, one should greatly purge the liver. If the illness occurs in autumn or winter, during the evening when the lungs are dominant, and cannot bear the strength of the liver, the liver is strong while the lungs are extremely deficient; thus, one should nourish the lungs and greatly purge the liver. Therefore, it is said that the eyes reflecting vision relate to the liver. In general, convulsions indicate internal conflict between wind and heat; since wind pertains to the liver, it manifests outwardly in the eyes. In this case, one should first purge the lungs using a lung-purging decoction. If after two days there is no agitation or confusion, it indicates the illness is receding. Afterwards, use Shudihuang pills to nourish the kidneys, and after three doses, utilize Xieqing pills, each two doses, to purge the heart and liver, and recovery will happen in five days. However, it is said that this condition is more common in males than in females, hence males are easier to treat than females. For example, if a female has convulsions and her eyes look to the left, the power of the lungs suppresses the liver, and if it occurs in autumn, when the lungs dominate and the liver cannot manage, it causes crying and shouting; thus, one should significantly purge the lungs first, then treat the heart and restore the liver. So it is said that if males have their eyes looking to the right, wood offends metal, the liver is strong against the lungs, and one should purge the liver. If the illness occurs again in spring or summer, when metal energy is extremely deficient, one should nourish the lungs, being careful not to purge.<a id="trans-375p" href="#orig-375p" class="marker">[375p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In &quot;The Complete Book on Sores and Ulcers&quot; by Dou Hanqing, it is stated: A young boy, seven years old, would faint upon hearing thunder, losing awareness of his surroundings. Using ginseng, goji berries, and Ophiopogon, he was given a small amount mixed with five flavors, consuming a pound of it, and afterwards he was unaffected by thunder.</p>
<p>In &quot;Confucianism and Caring for Parents&quot; by Zhang Congzheng, it is mentioned: A young boy from the Li family had convulsions in his hands and feet, which he demonstrated to a person named Dai. Dai said: &quot;It is due to excess heart fire. Do not hold his hands; you should let the convulsions continue.&quot; This was caused by the wetness from his nurse&#39;s holding while he was in the womb. He was advised to sweep and sprinkle water on the ground, ensuring it was very moist, then lay the child on the ground for a long time, allowing him to roll and turn, getting covered in mud as if washed in water. After a while, he was cured.</p>
<p>Li Dongyuan states: A girl from the Chen family, at eight years old, contracted convulsions. It would worsen in damp weather or if she was startled, producing drool and making sounds like a bleating sheep. Upon examination, I concluded that this was due to fright during pregnancy, and the ailment was deeply rooted. After six months of treatment, the condition improved, but she still required bland flavors to assist the medicine&#39;s efficacy. I provided her with Dan Pill, followed by Si Wu Decoction with added Coptis, adjusting as needed, and after half a year, she was stable.</p>
<p>Danchi&#39;s principles say: A granddaughter suffered from damp-heat during pregnancy, experiencing convulsions at noon, with dark lips and a pale face, having a seizure daily.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Luo Tianyi&#39;s &quot;Treasures of Health&quot; states: Wei Jingfu&#39;s son was four years old, and an elder rubbed his head to give a prophecy. The gathered monks recited incantations, which caused the child to be greatly frightened, leading to spasms, phlegm blockage, excessive white in the eyes, and a tense neck and back, with a phlegm-like voice in the throat. After a while, he seemed better. However, he would become frightened upon seeing people in black clothing, and he frequently took medications with realgar and dragon&#39;s brain for calming. After more than forty days, the symptoms persisted, and he began to walk and act in a dazed manner, so I was ordered to treat him. I diagnosed his pulse as deep, wiry, and rapid. The &quot;Huangdi Needle Classic&quot; states: &quot;A full heart pulse indicates epilepsy and convulsions,&quot; and &quot;The liver pulse is small and rapid, indicating epilepsy and convulsions.&quot; This is because a child&#39;s blood and qi are not yet stable, and their spirit is still weak. Thus, fear and fright arise, causing disturbances in the liver, which governs the tendons, leading to convulsions. After a prolonged illness, the qi weakens; children are more prone to vacuity and repletion. Taking too many calming medications further weakens their qi, hence the dazed walking and actions. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: &quot;Violent spasms during epilepsy—when the feet cannot support the body, one should needle the Tianzhu point.&quot; The Tianzhu point is where the Yang channels of the foot emerge. It further states: &quot;For convulsions and epilepsy that are unclear, the two yang feet are the main points, with male corresponding to yang and female to yin.&quot; The venerable Elder Jie Gu said: &quot;For daytime seizures, needle the Yang qiao in the Shen pulse; for night seizures, needle the Yin qiao in the Zhaohai point. First, moxa both points for two seven times.&quot; The Yang qiao Shen pulse point lies in the depression below the outer ankle, at the junction of the white flesh beneath the toenail, while the Yin qiao Zhaohai point is located in the depression below the inner ankle. Following this, I used a formula of fragrant agarwood and Tianma, and after taking three doses, he was completely cured.<a id="trans-377p" href="#orig-377p" class="marker">[377p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child, after being startled, developed epilepsy. I formulated a prescription: First, take one measure of heavenly water powder and grind it into a fine powder, dividing it into three doses. The first dose comprises 2.3 liang, mixed with 0.5 liang of genuine indigo powder, named &quot;Qinghun San&quot; (Quelling Soul Powder), to be brewed with bamboo leaf soup at the Yin and Mao hours, taking 1 qian to calm the liver fire. The second dose, also 2.3 liang, mixed with 0.5 liang of mercury powder, is named &quot;Anshen San&quot; (Calming Spirit Powder), to be brewed with lamp grass soup at the Si and Wu hours, taken to steady the spirit. The third dose, again 2.3 liang, mixed with 0.2 liang of genuine light powder, is named &quot;Dinghun San&quot; (Settling Soul Powder), to be brewed with light ginger soup at the Shen and You hours, taken to expel phlegm. After ten days, the child became stable.</p>
<p>There was a ten-year-old child who had suffered from epilepsy for a long time. Upon examination, his eyes appeared murky and lacked brightness, he spoke with difficulty, and his actions were dull and distracted. I told his father: &quot;It is not curable.&quot; Later, they sought medical treatment, but ultimately, there was no success. </p>
<p>In our county, there was a child from Wang Qianchuan suffering from shock illness, experiencing two to three episodes in one month. I stated: &quot;If not treated, it will surely develop into epilepsy.&quot; They sought my treatment, so I established a prescription using equal parts of bitter orange, coptis, pinellia, and white poria, halved, along with the mercury powder, halved again, ground together as before, and then made into pills the size of Chinese water chestnuts, coated with mercury powder. Each dose consisted of one pill, inserted into a pig&#39;s heart that had been cut open, secured with string, placed in a clay pot, boiled until cooked, and then the pig&#39;s heart was consumed with the medicine, accompanied by soup. After this treatment, the child did not experience further episodes, and I named it &quot;Duanqian Wan&quot; (Breaking Epilepsy Pill).<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the old county, Zhang Yuanshan’s eldest son fell seriously ill with a sudden convulsion and did not awaken for seventeen days. When I was called, his tongue was black. I once saw my father recite the &quot;Jade Casket Classic&quot;: &quot;In cases of cold damage, if the tongue is black and does not turn red with treatment, the medicine will clearly reveal fortune or misfortune.&quot; I asked, &quot;What medicine should be used to wash it?&quot; My father replied, &quot;Mint decoction.&quot; Following his advice, I urgently prepared the mint decoction to wash his tongue, and it turned red.

<p>Wang Yuanzhen’s youngest son fell ill in July due to eating improperly and contracted a fever, having convulsions for seven days. I observed that although the liver wind was severe, the spleen was not yet exhausted; thus, I needed to clear his liver and then replenish his spleen. I prescribed a liver-clearing powder in three doses, and the convulsions ceased. Later, I used a regulating herbal decoction to replenish his spleen and the Amber Baolong Pill to pacify his liver. He enjoyed sleep, but could not open his eyes. I thought that if he liked to sleep, it was not due to spleen exhaustion, but rather due to a dull spirit. The eyes are related to the liver, and the pupils to the spleen. If he could not open his eyes, it wasn’t that his soul was lost, but rather that his spirit was weary. Now, if he wished to open and close his eyes, it was evident. I used the previous formula again, and after two days, I instructed his family, who usually played with him, to bring small drums and cymbals into his room and sing and dance before his bed to create some noise. Within half a day, his eyes opened, and he gradually recovered. In total, he was stable after ten days.<a id="trans-380p" href="#orig-380p" class="marker">[380p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Hu Fengya, a child suffered from smallpox, leading to malnutrition and emaciation. A medical apprentice observed that it was not a symptom of malnutrition but rather blood deficiency. The family was confused. Initially, the child experienced a condition resembling epilepsy but was not actually epilepsy; during the day, he was calm, and at night, he had nightmares, clinging to his wet nurse, crying out, &quot;I’m scared, I’m scared,&quot; as if someone were trying to catch him. Inquiring about the cause of the illness, it was found that the child did not take medicine well; any attempt to administer it would involve frightening him with needles or fire, contributing to his condition. This was because the stomach represented the earth element, while the kidneys represented the water element; when combined, they transformed into fire. The kidneys govern fear, and fear harms the kidneys. This was due to the weakness of the spleen and stomach, which could not nourish the lungs, leading to a deficiency in the kidneys. The kidneys house willpower, and if they are deficient, the spirit cannot be settled, resulting in anxiety and fear. When awake, the spirit resides in the heart; when asleep, it resides in the kidneys, with the spleen acting as the gateway for the will. Thus, the primary treatment should be to nourish the spleen, with calming the spirit as a secondary measure. To nourish the spleen, use Fei Er Wan; to calm the spirit, use Qian&#39;s Anshen Wan. After six months of treatment, the child was at peace. </p>
<p>A seven-month-old child experienced convulsions at all times, was in a stupor unresponsive to wakefulness, did not cry or nurse, did not respond to calling or moxibustion, did not react to inhaling substances, and was unable to take medicine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child had convulsions and phlegm blockage, and a doctor used white pills to treat it without success. After three doses, the child&#39;s condition worsened; the child lay with closed eyes, in a deep sleep, neither crying nor breastfeeding, with a wheezing sound in the throat, gasping for breath, and laxative stools. I said: &quot;The organs are failing; the condition is incurable. The excessive treatment has backfired.&quot; The doctor replied: &quot;The white pills are a miraculous remedy from the Qian family for phlegm.&quot; I said: &quot;To fully trust books is no better than having no books at all. The Qian family&#39;s pediatric techniques stem from the teachings of their disciples. Just as wood has moisture, humans have phlegm. In hot weather, plants exude moisture, which generates phlegm naturally—this is an evident truth. Phlegm is like water; it moves with the air and flows downward when it encounters an obstruction. It is not the nature of water to be stagnant. Forcing it can only exacerbate the issue. Now that phlegm rises with the fire, it is better to reduce the heat and let it descend, rather than damaging the stomach&#39;s vital energy. If the stomach&#39;s energy fails, the five organs will suffer as well. Therefore, when the eyes cannot open, it indicates liver failure; when the child is in a deep sleep and cannot breastfeed, it indicates spleen failure; when there is no crying, it indicates heart failure; when wheezing and phlegm are present, it indicates lung failure; and when there are issues with urination, it indicates kidney failure. Ultimately, it’s beyond healing and leads to death.</p>
<p>In the town, there was a Confucian doctor who treated ailments with remarkable remedies but was overly rigid and unaware of the need for flexibility. Once, a child had convulsions, and I thought it was a case of sudden fright, so I suggested a cooling purge, using Daochi powder and Xieqing pills. He argued that the convulsions were due to accumulated liver fire. When fire accumulates, it triggers convulsions, and he recommended a little life-preserving soup. People could not decide; they followed both approaches. My treatment resulted in safety within a day, while his led to death. Regret for not believing my words was now too late to remedy.<a id="trans-383p" href="#orig-383p" class="marker">[383p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child experienced convulsions. Initially, the method of pushing was used, but it only worsened the situation. I stated that the pushing technique is derived from the principles of acupuncture and massage. The classic says: &quot;Do not stab a person of great deficiency.&quot; The technique of pushing and pinching can only be applied to those who are strong and healthy. In the case of weak individuals, their energy does not circulate; pushing them can lead to sweating and ultimately harm their vital energy. The family did not believe my words. I warned them that if they did not take heed, the child would surely develop epilepsy. Two weeks later, he sadly passed away.</p>
<p>In the second month of the gui-hai year, a child of a certain Wu from Ying County experienced convulsions. Local doctors treated him with Erchen Decoction, ginger juice, and bamboo juice, but there was no improvement. Wu, who had just assumed his position, knew me from a previous encounter, so he sent someone to call me. Upon my arrival, I observed the child: his three places of vital energy were bluish, his cheeks were red, and his eyes had a fixed gaze; his fingers were curled as if in a fire. I concluded that his condition was caused by an external factor that had yet to be released, with heat embedded inside. A physician named Qian observed that heat in the liver causes fixed gaze; heat in the heart leads to convulsions. He also said that red cheeks coupled with a fixed gaze indicated impending wind-styled fits. The child’s liver was constantly in excess, and combined with the time of wood dominance, we needed to purge the liver. The ingredients of Erchen Decoction—aged tangerine peel, pinellia, and ginger—are all items that support the liver. The classics say: &quot;Supplement with acrid,&quot; hence the inefficacy. I then prescribed Qingxie Pills to purge the excess from the liver wood, and Daohong Powder to clear the fire from the heart. After just one dose, the convulsions stopped. </p>
<p>Noticing his innate constitution was weak and his spleen and stomach were also frail, I feared he would later develop convulsions and finally become epileptic. So, I prepared Amber Pills for him to take regularly, which calmed him.<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Qishui, on the sandy slope, Xu Shudao&#39;s child was afflicted by convulsions. He first consulted a physician of the Zhang surname, but after several days, there was no improvement. He requested my help; the child was in severe distress with phlegm and wheezing, and frequent convulsions. I first treated the phlegm, then addressed the convulsions, gradually stabilizing the situation. However, the child still had a strong fever. The Zhang physician wanted to use a detoxifying decoction, a bamboo leaf decoction, and a minor Bupleurum decoction, all of which I opposed, saying: &quot;A child&#39;s liver is often excessive, while the spleen is usually deficient. The illness arises from the liver, where wind and wood are essentially vigorous, and the spleen and earth are injured. This is indeed false heat; do not use cold and cool treatments, as they will harm the central qi.&quot; Thus, I prescribed the Four Gunners Decoction, adding roasted astragalus and fried black ginger; after one dose, the child was at peace.<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A five-year-old child, startled from a dream, cried out in fear while holding onto his mother. This was due to being frightened. I prepared a remedy using equal parts of ginseng, Ophiopogon, Poria, Coptis, sour jujube seed, biota seed, roasted licorice, and realgar. I brewed half in water and mixed the other half with prepared Rehmannia, ground with roasted licorice into a powder, then made pills the size of millet grains. Each dose consisted of twenty-five pills taken with a broth made from lampwick, and before the full dose was finished, he was calm.</p>
<p>When I first practiced medicine, I treated a two-year-old boy who experienced convulsions and died. However, his complexion had not changed, and his hands and feet were still warm. He was not truly dead but suffered from a trapped qi and phlegm obstruction, leading to suffocation. I took mugwort and made small moxibustion sticks, applying them to the Zhongchong acupoints of both hands. When the fire reached the flesh, the boy woke up with a loud cry. I then used a family herbal remedy for fright, giving him fifteen pills of realgar detoxifying pills to expel phlegm and twenty-five pills of cooling fright pills to reduce heat. I combined these and administered them with a peppermint decoction. Shortly thereafter, he expelled yellow phlegm, and the convulsions stopped.</p>
<p>A one-year-old had a fever accompanied by convulsions. After administering Qingpian pills without effect, I inquired about the nature of his convulsions. His mother replied, &quot;After the convulsion, he only wants to sleep, and when he wakes, he plays and makes cat sounds, laughing when he sees others.&quot; I said, &quot;A physician must distinguish signs, and medicines must match those signs.&quot; I gave him Daochi Powder, and after one dose, he was calm. His father asked why this was so. I explained, &quot;The heart is associated with fire, and its sound is laughter. Fire is generated in the Yin hour, associated with the tiger, and the cat is a related creature. Therefore, making cat sounds and laughing indicates it is not a liver issue but rather a heart condition. Hence, I used Daochi Powder to drain the heart&#39;s fire and restore calm.&quot;<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child experienced convulsions, and as a result of the method of pushing, there was a temporary retreat. A month later, on schedule, the convulsions recurred. Sometimes it would happen once a month, or even twice in a month. I said: the illness has developed into epilepsy. The method of pushing is meant to express the intention to release; phlegm accumulates in the heart and cannot be expelled. Fortunately, if epilepsy is caught early, it can still be treated; if it lingers, it will become a lifelong affliction that is incurable. Therefore, I prescribed a formula using five qian of huanglian, two and a half qian of zhushā, three fen of fèibái gānsuì, and one qian of dǎnxīng, ground into powder. Mix with glutinous rice paste and pig heart blood, then form into pills the size of qian seeds. Take one pill each time, decocted in a soup of lampwick, taking three at night and one during the day; thus, it was resolved.</p>
<p>Wang Lun in &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Physicians&quot; states: A three-year-old child experienced convulsions due to fright, accompanied by fever and excessive phlegm. Long-term use of medicines like Baolong Pill to clear phlegm instead caused the child’s complexion to turn either red or blue. I reasoned that initially this was due to the liver being obstructed by excess邪, hence the suitable use of the former medicine. Now, the complexion being blue and red indicates a deficiency heat of the liver meridian, which is insufficiently affecting the heart. I first used Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, supplemented with Liu Junzi Tang with a slight addition of Chaihu and Shengma to regulate and support the spleen and stomach, leading to a swift resolution of symptoms and complete recovery.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A girl from the Xi family, six years old, suddenly experienced fright, her eyes moving and teeth grinding. Sometimes she would have seizures in her sleep, with an abundance of phlegm and saliva. Various medications to dissipate phlegm and expel wind had little effect. I said: Her face is pale, and the symptoms she shows indicate that the liver&#39;s wood is overpowering the spleen&#39;s earth, which cannot control the salivation and causes it to rise. Therefore, nourishing the kidney&#39;s water and generating the liver&#39;s blood will cause the wind to cease and the phlegm to dissipate. I then used the Six-Flavor Pill and she recovered.</p>
<p>A young boy suffered from similar symptoms, with phlegm and saliva flowing freely. The use of medications for fright worsened his condition, and his spleen and stomach became weaker. Examining his complexion, he appeared pale and yellow, with saliva in his mouth. I treated him with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another boy had twitching eyes and spasms in his hands and feet. After taking Tianma Fangfeng Wan and similar medications to expel wind and transform phlegm, his previous symptoms did not improve, and the phlegm worsened. He was able to eat, and gradually his symptoms improved. Upon examining his nose and the color of his left cheek, which was blue and yellow, I said: The spleen governs saliva; this condition is due to the liver&#39;s wood overpowering the spleen&#39;s earth, which cannot manage the saliva; it is not merely phlegm accumulation. I then used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Shengma, Chaihu, and Diaoteng in two doses. His intake of food gradually increased, and all symptoms improved. I also used the Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to stabilize him.</p>
<p>A candidate, while being treated for food-induced scarlet fever, experienced spasms in his hands and feet after taking exterior-releasing medication. He took Baolong Wan and had twitching eyes and shortness of breath with excessive phlegm. I said: This is due to spleen and stomach deficiency leading to sluggish fright; there is no wind to expel and no phlegm to dispel; it is a manifestation of deficiency. I then used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with an added dose of Fuzi, and he became stable. After another dose, he recovered.<a id="trans-388p" href="#orig-388p" class="marker">[388p]</a></p></div>

After taking ingredients like brain, musk, and vermilion, he developed chronic fright and eventually passed away.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child suffered from a sudden fright, was about to recover, but then developed a fever and restlessness. Some used remedies to dispel wind and transform phlegm, which intensified the fright and convulsions, leading to phlegm cough, abdominal bloating, reduced appetite, and aversion to cold. Others used Baolong pills, which resulted in stools resembling dysentery, alternating chills and fever, resembling a wind syndrome. The late emperor examined him and believed it was due to spleen deficiency, rendering the channels unable to nourish. He prescribed Four Gentlemen Decoction, with a little Shengma and Chaihu to boost Yang qi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>The son of Da Yin Liu Yingchang suffered from scrofula and consistently took phlegm-transforming remedies, resulting in a virtual presentation that resembled convulsions. He also took the Treasure Pill for dispelling wind, experiencing frequent urination, limb convulsions, sometimes with eyes rolling, grinding his teeth and yawning, or feeling nauseous with poor appetite and stools falling into diarrhea. This indicated that the earth was injured and wood was overpowering. He was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and was cured.</p>
<p>In winter, Zhu Xiaoxi’s son had a tubercle in the neck, with a pale yellow complexion, emaciation, grinding teeth, convulsions, shaking his head and rolling his eyes.

<p>The grandson of Xianmu Gu Feizhai, Zhou Er, had a tubercle in the neck, arms stretched backward, and sought medicine for removing toxins.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Confucian scholar Wang Wenyuan&#39;s child suffered from tuberculosis with excessive phlegm and convulsions. After taking a formula with gold and stone to dry the phlegm, the child&#39;s hands and feet became rigid. This was due to a renewal of liver blood injury leading to acute convulsions. He then used an enhanced version of Xiaochaihu Decoction, adding Diaolenteng, Shanzhi, Xiong, and Gui to the mixture, and also used a formula combining Liuwei Dihuang Wan with Wuwei, preparing it with Mai Dong for safety.</p>
<p>The &quot;Baoyin Jinjing Lu&quot; states: A child with fever and seizures, or with limbs trembling and the left cheek red, indicates a clash of wind-heat in the heart and liver channels.

<p>When a child seized and cried out, with cold hands and feet and a blue-black left cheek, it indicated weakness of the liver and spleen, with kidney water counteracting the spleen earth.

<p>A child experiencing tidal fever and convulsions—phlegm and saliva rising, with cold hands and feet, and a blue cheek until dusk, the hand and foot tensing at times—this indicated a weakness in the liver channel, with the lung metal being overpowering, causing tidal convulsions, and the spleen earth being weak, hence the coldness in hands and feet. Use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to adjust and tonify the spleen and lungs, along with Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys for recovery. Given that excess pathogenic qi was present, one should recognize the deficiency of the original qi; using formulas to purge liver heat and transform phlegm would lead to missteps.<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child had a dark blue-black mark on the forehead and cried out at night in convulsions. I believed it was due to a deficiency of spleen and dampness, and recommended a decoction of Uncaria to calm him. Later, as the convulsions were triggered by fright, I used the same decoction, and the previous symptoms ceased suddenly. I then used Yiqing San, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child exhibited a blue discoloration in the eyes and had convulsions, looking upward and crying incessantly. An attempt to treat him with Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan was unsuccessful; instead, he ground his teeth and experienced discomfort, involuntarily urinating. This was due to a severe deficiency of liver blood and qi. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and he was healed.</p>
<p>A different child experienced convulsions and eye rolling, attributed to wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder channels. Initially, I administered Chai Hu Qing Gan San to clear the liver, then Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the kidneys, and he was cured.</p>
<p>Another child presented with fever and thirst, using Xie Huang San, but had heavy, sinking stools and drool at the corners of the mouth while expressing a desire to expel fire. I noted that while the nose was bluish-white with little yellow, this indicated a deficiency of spleen and stomach with coldness being overpowered by liver wood. The drooling was due to the stomach not being able to control fluids. The heavy stools indicated that the spleen qi could not rise. Believing this to be a severe deficiency leading to slow spleen wind, I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang adding Dang Gui, Mu Xiang, Pao Jiang, and two doses of Uncaria, which greatly benefited. I wished to prescribe more, but I cautioned that the strength of the medication had not reached its goal. If the previous medicine did not match the symptoms, disaster would follow. I then added a slice of Fu Zi to the previous formula, and after taking it, he became calm. I subsequently removed the Fu Zi and adjusted his treatment over two more doses until he recovered.<a id="trans-391p" href="#orig-391p" class="marker">[391p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child appeared silent and lethargic, with cold limbs and signs of fright; the spasm felt like a bow drawn inward. This indicates deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, coupled with an external invasion of cold evil. First, use the Wake-up Powder to dispel the external evil and regulate the stomach qi, resulting in immediate improvement. However, as the hands and feet remained cold, also employ the Six Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the original qi, leading to stability after several days.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; states: when liver wind causes head shaking, numerous prescriptions do not address it. Zheng, a bureaucrat&#39;s child, suffered for seven years with head shaking and had three years of bloody stools; having taken over a hundred prescriptions, those aimed at treating head shaking were all &#39;wind&#39; medicines, while blood-stopping remedies either caused dysentery or wind in the intestines, with no effectiveness among a hundred medicines. After observing the condition and understanding the details, it was still unclear what the root of the issue was. Upon reflection, it became evident that the blood in the liver was abundant while being externally attacked by wind-heat. The liver belongs to wood, and when it is excessive, the spleen earth is overrun by wood. The spleen and lungs are interrelated, both being overcome by the liver, leading to blood seepage into stools, resulting in persistent bloody stools. Therefore, I prescribed a formula that reduces liver wind while strengthening the spleen, using one part of rhinoceros horn powder and licorice, half a tael of wild gourd root, one qian of roasted red snake skin, five taels of wind-protecting herb, one qian of twining vine, one qian of麻黄 without joints, half a tael of honey-roasted astragalus, five qian of notopterygium, and five qian of white peony, ground into powder. Make into pills with jujube meat and take with mint tea after meals, only requiring two doses to take effect. The head shaking immediately ceased, and the bloody stools resolved as well. Subsequently, the Stomach Wind Decoction was taken, and after several days, all symptoms disappeared. Shen&#39;s child also found this effective.<a id="trans-393p" href="#orig-393p" class="marker">[393p]</a></p></div>

I believe that the cough and wheezing indicate deficiency in the spleen and lungs; the convulsions indicate that wood is overpowering earth; the bluish and yellowish complexion indicates that the liver is supporting heart fire; and the swelling and drooling indicate weak spleen qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A youth named Wang Yanghu experienced a fracture of the femur. The orthopedic treatment had been completed, but upon examining his complexion, which was pale and ashen, and noting slight movement at the corners of his mouth, I diagnosed this as a case of the liver wood insulting the spleen. Both qi and blood while musculoskeletal are sustained by the spleen&#39;s earth, and only by strengthening the spleen&#39;s qi can the injured recover. I then administered over thirty doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction, Diao Teng (Uncaria), and Angelica, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>One child suffered from seizures due to heat at noon, showing signs of fatigue, a pale complexion, reluctance to eat, and excessive salivation. I concluded that this was due to a deficiency of heart fire, which could not nourish the spleen&#39;s earth. Despite this, he took cooling heart medication, which led to increased vomiting and diarrhea, and he nearly developed chronic spleen wind. I used Six Gentlemen Decoction, ginger, and cinnamon, combined with the Rehmannia pill, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a seven-year-old had seizures with persistent fever, which worsened around noon. He showed extreme fatigue and heat, but when cooled with soup, the symptoms persisted. This indicated a deficiency of heart and spleen qi. In the morning, I prescribed the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Yi Zhi Ren (Alpinia) and in the evening, I used Six Gentlemen, Angelica, and Diao Teng, leading to recovery. However, after overeating, he vomited and had diarrhea again, and treating with Bao He Pill exacerbated his symptoms of cold and heat with seizures. This was due to the spleen being injured again and insulted by the liver&#39;s wood. I then used Six Gentlemen and Chai Hu, which alleviated the cold and heat, allowing him to eat more, but he still had diarrhea around noon. Finally, I added Fu Ling (Poria), Ban Xia (Pinellia), and Diao Teng to the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and he recovered.<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child experienced convulsions within a hundred days, with phlegm and saliva flowing uncontrollably. The use of wind-dispelling medicine greatly worsened the condition. Observing the complexion, it was yellow with a hint of white, indicating spleen deficiency that could not control the saliva. By using the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Supplementing the Middle and Nourishing Qi Decoction, the child recovered. Later, the child suffered again, accompanied by asthma. I suspected the lungs were deficient and unable to retain qi. I used the Five Flavor Different Function Powder, with the addition of Uncaria and Bupleurum, to adjust and nourish the spleen and lungs, clear liver fire, and calm the condition.</p>
<p>A young child showed similar symptoms, with a bluish-black or pale yellow complexion. Upon examining the mother, I discovered she had long-standing frustrations. I treated her with an augmented version of Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Decoction, and the child also recovered.</p>
<p>A young child experienced convulsions and nasal obstruction within a month, which was due to wind-evil harming the body. I prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Platycodon and Asarum, for both mother and child to take.

After a while, the nasal discharge and convulsions ceased.</p>
<p>A child less than two months old had convulsions and vomited milk, with abdominal distension and diarrhea, indicating damage to the spleen and stomach from milk. I used the Five Flavor Different Function Powder with added Rhizoma Typhonii for the mother to take, and the child took about a spoonful, subsequently recovering.</p>
<p>A young child had sudden fright, excessive phlegm, and undigested milk, which was due to the invasion of wind-evil combined with fright, harming the liver and spleen and causing qi deficiency. Initially, I used Tianma Fángfēng Wan to expel wind and calm fright, then used the Five Flavor Different Function Powder to strengthen the spleen and stop the convulsions, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had a fever with stiffness, and the limbs were rigid, with the left cheek reddened. This indicated wind-heat in both the heart and liver channels.

<p>Another small child had a blue color in the eyes and experienced convulsions, with the gaze directed upwards and continued crying.

The child wanted quicker results, so I tried using similar treatments with Sophora japonica, which worsened the symptoms. Eventually, I referred the case to the hospital director for treatment, who used the same remedies but added peach kernel and red peony, and it took up to a hundred doses for recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, a small child experienced a stagnation of food and took purging medicines, resulting in a pale yellow complexion, general fatigue, decreased appetite, and feverish chills from Shen and You time. I intended to use tonic medicines, but they refused, opting instead for clearing heat and inducing diarrhea, which only aggravated the condition.

When pressed, the pain subsided. This was a case of damage to the spleen and stomach leading to symptom change. Therefore, a combination of the Seven Flavor Bai Zhu Powder and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was administered for immediate relief.</p>
<p>Another young child had food stagnation and was given digestive medicines. It was noted that this was due to spleen and stomach deficiency leading to food stagnation, necessitating a nourishing approach.

The Four Gentlemen Decoction was given, which allowed for improved diet, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, resolving all symptoms.</p>
<p>The child of Yao Yi experienced a reddening of the body during food stoppage due to internal food stagnation and damp-heat manifesting outward.

Care was taken to ensure all was expelled. The next day, a slight dose of the Seven Flavor Bai Zhu Powder was used to regulate the spleen and stomach, leading to no further issues.</p>
<p>Another young child stopping food intake was given a laxative, resulting in vomiting and abdominal distension, indicating further spleen and stomach damage, treated effectively with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>A young child had involuntary eye movement and limb spasms. Several doses of Tian Ma Fang Feng Pill and similar remedies failed to resolve the prior condition but did improve phlegm slightly. Upon examining the child’s pulse and noticing a greenish-yellow complexion on the left cheek, it was concluded that the spleen governs saliva, and liver wood was overpowering spleen earth, disrupting the regulation of phlegm, thus confirming excess phlegm. Subsequently, a combined treatment of Liu Jun and herbs like Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, and Diao Teng was used, allowing for gradual dietary improvement and symptom resolution; further treatment with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction provided stability.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A treatment for a young child who suffered from fever and diarrhea at the times of Hai, Zi, and Chou used the beneficial Huang powder, resulting in recovery. This condition recurred, and after taking the same medicine, the child became drowsy with open eyes, experienced thirst, had a reduced appetite, and passed yellow stools frequently. I diagnosed it as the liver being dominant and the spleen being deficient, with the vital energy sinking. I administered the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction with a supplement of Rehmannia Pills, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>For an elderly child one year old, who was exposed to sudden cold in early autumn and developed convulsions resembling epilepsy, followed by shallow breathing, it was determined that this was due to weak vital energy. The Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction was given, resulting in tranquility.</p>
<p>One child aged ten and another aged seven each had epilepsy, occurring twice a year. Later, after experiencing smallpox and suffering from food stagnation, the frequency of seizures increased. Both were treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction, resulting in relief.</p>
<p>A six-year-old child suddenly developed convulsions, with eye movements and teeth grinding, and sometimes startled and convulsed in sleep, with drooling of phlegm. Taking medications to resolve phlegm and dispel wind only exacerbated the condition, and the child’s complexion turned blue. This was attributed to liver wood restraining spleen earth, preventing retention of saliva, thus leading to upward movement of phlegm. It was necessary to nourish kidney water and create liver blood, which would allow the wind to cease and phlegm to dissipate. The Six-Flavor Pills were administered, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child suffering from epilepsy would vomit phlegm upon each episode, becoming drowsy and recovering partially. Various medications were ineffective. At the age of thirteen, the episodes increased in frequency. The treatment involved grinding placenta into powder, adding ginseng and angelica root powder, forming pills the size of walnuts. Each dose consisted of thirty to fifty pills, taken three to five times a day. Over a month, the child gradually improved, and the Eight Treasures Decoction was also used to achieve full recovery.<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child with a cold developed spasms, excessive phlegm, and a severe cough. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of spleen and lung qi, with the external pathogenic influence taking advantage of it. I prescribed a formula combining Six Gentlemen with Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, Sang Pi, and Xing Ren, which relieved the phlegm and wheezing. After one dose, I removed the Sang Pi and Xing Ren and added Zhao Teng Gou for stabilization, then used Yi Gong San. After several doses, the symptoms did not recur. If the spleen and stomach are not strengthened, and the exterior defense is not secured, but treatment focuses solely on phlegm, there are rarely good outcomes.</p>
<p>A different child experienced food stagnation, vomiting, and diarrhea, and subsequently started clenching teeth with spasms, a pale blue complexion, and cold hands and feet with twitching of the brows and lips. I believed this to be due to a weak spleen and stomach, worsened by the medicine, with the liver wood overpowering it, leading to chronic convulsions. I thus used Six Gentlemen adding Mu Xiang, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma in two doses to stabilize the situation. Generally, in cases of food stagnation, even with spasms and similar symptoms, one should avoid medication and allow the accumulated food to digest completely; as gastric energy strengthens, self-recovery occurs. If one insists on forcing food or misuses herbs, it not only worsens existing issues but also creates new ones.</p>
<p>A scholar&#39;s son, Du Kehong, had a fever with convulsions and a stiff mouth with phlegm surging; this indicated fullness-fire in the liver and gallbladder meridians, an urgent case of sudden convulsions. I first used Xie Qing Wan, followed by two doses of Liu Wei Wan, which caused immediate improvement in symptoms. I then administered Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Chuan Xiong, Gui, Shan Zhi, and Zhao Teng Gou for stabilization, and finally used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for recovery.<a id="trans-401p" href="#orig-401p" class="marker">[401p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child was tormented by fever, startled fits, and unable to nurse, with a pulse resembling tangled fish bones. This indicated a sudden attack of wind-heat. I first administered a small dose of Baolong Pill to dispel wind and transform phlegm, followed by Liu Junzi Decoction with Chaihu to strengthen the spleen and soothe the liver, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, during the hot months, experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with slight movements of the eyes and lips, a pale blue complexion, and cold hands and feet. I utilized Yulu Powder; I suspected it had developed into slow spleen wind and recommended warming and supplementing the spleen and stomach. They did not believe me, and subsequently, the child died.</p>
<p>A child with tongue playing and fits, whose fingers were not cold, led me to believe there was deficiency-heat in the liver and spleen. I prescribed Yigong Powder with Shengma and Chaihu, leading to recovery. Later, due to abdominal distension from nursing injuries, I administered medications to counteract stagnation, resulting in diarrhea and tongue playing with fits. I examined the mother’s liver fire and treated them both with Xiao Chaihu Decoction plus Shengma and Baizhu, resulting in both recovering.</p>
<p>One child, overindulging in milk and food, suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. I used a large dose of Yigong Powder combined with Chaihu and Shengma, and both mother and child recovered. Later, due to fright, they took medicinal substances similar to Zhibao Pill, which caused tongue playing and fits nearly leading to slow fright. I employed Liu Junzi Decoction with Bai Fuzheng and they recovered.</p>
<p>Another child showed tongue protrusion, fever, and an aversion to cold drinks, with yellow-red forehead and nose, and excessive salivation. I diagnosed it as excess heat in the heart and spleen and prescribed Daohong and Xiehuang powders for recovery. After a relapse, they took other heat-clearing medicines but continued with tongue playing. I then used Yigong Powder with Diaoteng and brought them to stability; I also administered Liu Junzi Decoction for total recovery.<a id="trans-402p" href="#orig-402p" class="marker">[402p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child, while sleeping at night, suddenly became startled and convulsed, with a foul-smelling and dark-colored stool. This indicates a spleen injury and excessive liver energy. Initially, a modified Yigong powder with Chaihu, Shengma, and Shanzhizi was used, followed by a remedy of four medicinals for children, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child, sporadically startled from sleep and convulsing, experienced thirst and drank cold water, with a bluish left cheek and a red forehead. First, a Chaihu Liver Clearing powder combined with four doses of Diaoteng hook was used to treat liver fire, followed by Wuwei Yigong powder to strengthen the spleen, and Dihuang pills to nourish the kidney and liver for calming.</p>
<p>A nine-year-old child developed a fever due to fright, resulting in convulsions and a feeling of heaviness. The child ground their teeth out of thirst for cold drinks and experienced constipation, with a face showing both bluish and red hues, and a notably red area on the left cheek. This is a sign of the heart and liver channels being affected by wind-heat, indicating a condition of substantial illness. Initially, a Xieqing pill and a prepared Huanglian were used, resulting in prompt bowel movement and significant reduction of heat-related convulsions. Subsequently, a Yiqing pill was administered, causing all symptoms to recede. However, the child&#39;s complexion remained pale and sallow, with limb fatigue and decreased appetite; this indicated that the pathogenic qi had departed but the spleen&#39;s energy had not yet recovered. Thus, a tonic of Buzhong Yiqi decoction and Dihuang pills were used for full recovery.</p>
<p>Another child experienced fever and convulsions, with a closed mouth and phlegm flowing; this was caused by excess fire in the gallbladder channel leading to convulsions from fright. Initially, a Xieqing pill was given, followed by two doses of Liuli pills, and the symptoms immediately subsided. Then, a small dose of Chaihu soup combined with Qianghuo, Angelica, Shanzhizi, and Diaoteng hook was used, followed by Buzhong Yiqi decoction, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-403p" href="#orig-403p" class="marker">[403p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A small child suddenly developed a fever, with trembling and clenching teeth, accompanied by a profusion of phlegm. Administration of medications for expelling wind and transforming phlegm worsened the condition. The child&#39;s complexion was bluish-yellow, indicating that the liver (wood element) was damaging the spleen (earth element). The spleen&#39;s fluid is saliva; when deficient, it cannot contain, causing it to rise and resemble phlegm. The treatment should focus on nourishing the liver and strengthening the spleen, leading to relief from wind and healing of phlegm. Therefore, six flavor pill and six gentlemen decoction were administered, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old girl, prone to anger, experienced sudden fright during sleep, with whole-body itching and diminished appetite. This was due to liver fire and wind-heat disturbing the spleen. A decoction of ginseng, wormwood, and zizyphus was used to clear liver fire, cool the liver blood, and strengthen the spleen and stomach, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child suffered from sudden convulsions, presenting with a flushed face, fever, and thirst for cold drinks. The previous physician had administered a dose of the blue-purge pill, which reduced the fever significantly. However, the following morning, the child took another dose and immediately experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions, with a bluish-white complexion and cold extremities. I surmised the fever had been alleviated but inappropriate administration further harmed the spleen and stomach. Thus, I prescribed the six gentlemen decoction with ginger, cinnamon, bulbus elevatae, and bupleurum, providing immediate relief. The ancients noted that children easily shift between deficiency and excess; thus, using harsh purgatives can abruptly stop the illness. This principle was followed by my previous mentor.</p>
<p>A small child experienced tidal fever with convulsions, rising phlegm, and cold extremities, with a bluish tint and hidden whiteness on the left cheek at the shen and you times. This indicated deficiency in the heart and liver meridians. The secret-anxiety calming pill and four-herb decoction, along with radix ledebouriella and sour jujube seeds, were administered, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another small child presented with tidal fever and convulsions, with phlegm rising, cold extremities, and a bluish color with hidden white on the left cheek during the evening. A decoction for tonifying and invigorating qi was used to bolster the spleen and lungs. The six flavor pill nourished the liver and kidneys, leading to healing.<a id="trans-404p" href="#orig-404p" class="marker">[404p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young girl from Jiaxing, aged seven, suffered a leg injury from a fall, resulting in swelling and ulceration of her knees, alongside a bluish color on her left cheek and absence of the left wrist pulse. Her fright caused her Qi to disperse, while wind-heat became stagnant in her liver, hence the hidden pulse. I first administered a dose of the Four Gentlemen decoction with added Shengma, Chaihu, and Diaoteng, which stabilized her pulse. Then I used the Four Substances decoction with Chaihu, Fangfeng, and Diaoteng to nourish blood and liver, and she recovered.</p>
<p>A young boy experienced convulsions followed by persistent phlegmy cough and restless sleep with no effect from various medicines. I gave him a small dose of Niuhuang Qingxin Wan, which stopped the symptoms; later, he caught a cold, resulting in phlegm accumulation and urgent wheezing, troubled by inability to eat. I again used a small dose of Niuhuang Wan to calm him; subsequently, I administered Yigong San with added Jiegeng, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Another boy exhibited convulsions with drooling phlegm; using the medication for convulsions exacerbated his condition. Observing his pale yellow complexion, I applied the Six Gentlemen decoction and the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction to tonify his spleen and lung, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A child suffering from a cold presented a cough with phlegm. I suspected a deficiency in the spleen and weakness in the lungs, contributing to an invulnerability to external wind. I treated him with the Six Gentlemen decoction, Jiegeng, Sangpi, and Xingren, which resulted in recovery. Later, he faced food stagnation and abdominal distention, leading me to add Hawthorn and Houpu to the Six Gentlemen formula for relief. However, he encountered vomiting with stagnant food; administering medication exacerbated his cough. I determined that both his spleen and lungs were deficient, thus a restorative approach was required. He thought it would suffice to use medicines for dispersal, but his previous symptoms worsened, causing his head to shake. I then prescribed a potent Tian Nanshen powder, significantly increasing Diaoteng and combining it with Yigong San, which ultimately brought about his recovery.<a id="trans-405p" href="#orig-405p" class="marker">[405p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child has a crooked mouth and eyes, with a face that is sometimes blue and sometimes red; this indicates that the wind-fire of the liver and heart is attacking the spleen. In the morning, a formula called Chaihu Qinggan San is used, and in the evening, a modified Yigong San with added Diaoteng is given, resulting in recovery. At that time, the child had previous symptoms and those who took drugs to dispel wind and guide phlegm could not improve.</p>
<p>Another young child, after suffering from dysentery, exhibited spasm of the anterior symptoms, a withered yellow complexion, and lethargic limbs; this indicated a deficiency of vital energy due to excessive depletion. I used a modified Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with added Diaoteng, and after taking it, the child gradually recovered. Later, due to the wet nurse&#39;s inappropriate emotional state and diet, or perhaps the child overfed, the previous symptoms returned, but it resolved after taking Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Wuwei Yigong San.</p>
<p>Another child, startled by the wet nurse, began to have spasms, presenting with red eyes, a strong fever, abdominal pain, crying and bending forward. I administered Sihua combined with Chaihu and Fangfeng, and then used a modified Xiaoyao San with cooked Dihuang to clear the liver heat. Blood from the liver was generated, and I further used Dihuang Wan to nourish the kidney water to engender the liver wood, resulting in safety for both mother and child.</p>
<p>Another young child cried while bending forward, presenting with a blue face and black lips; this was due to cold air affecting the body, causing internal abdominal pain. I gave a dose of Wuwei Yigong San with added Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, and this was taken by the mother as well, resulting in immediate recovery. Later, due to the mother catching a cold and experiencing abdominal pain while crying, I administered a dose of Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang to the mother, which also calmed down the child.<a id="trans-406p" href="#orig-406p" class="marker">[406p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another young child had a scrofula that ruptured, causing convulsions, irritability, teeth grinding, and alternating chills and fever. This was attributed to liver wind-heat. Initially, a dose of Chai Hu Zhi Zi San was given, which promptly halted the chills and fever. Subsequently, he used Si Wu Tang, Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Bai Zhu, and Chai Hu, which gradually alleviated the symptoms. He then administered the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding Shao Yao and Fu Ling, resulting in complete recovery.</p>
<p>A child with a scalp wound that had ruptured developed convulsions, accompanied by either chills and fever or cold hands and feet. The pulse was large and floating but weak upon palpation, indicating deficiency of original qi and excess of pathogenic qi. He prescribed several doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, leading to gradual improvement in symptoms and a more restrained pulse. After over ten doses, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A young child experienced convulsions due to fright, after taking Bao Long Wan and Bao Sheng Ding, he had excessive saliva, sweating, and convulsions, and still wanted to expel phlegm. I stated that this was due to deficiency of liver and spleen blood, leading to internal wind. The persistent phlegm retention was due to spleen and lung qi deficiency, unable to control saliva. The sweating and convulsions indicated a loss of yang due to spleen and lung qi deficiency. He used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Pao Jiang and Mu Xiang, which resulted in immediate recovery; he then applied Si Jun Zi Tang with Gui Zhi and Huang Qi for stabilization.<a id="trans-409p" href="#orig-409p" class="marker">[409p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from a cold and fever, took herbal medicine for relief, and perspired incessantly. The symptoms of vexation were fully present, with a pulse that was large and rapid, but felt thin upon pressure. This excessive sweating indicated a loss of yang, along with a deficiency of spleen and lung qi. I prescribed Yigong San with added Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Astragalus, which promptly stopped the sweating. Then I administered the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child, having stopped eating, was experiencing abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, and after taking a harsh remedy, continued to vomit and diarrhea, sweating profusely, with cold hands and feet, and unceasing spasms. The pulse was floating and rapid, but felt like silk upon pressing. I used Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Sheng Ma and roasted Ginger, which halted the spasms immediately. However, as the child continued to have alternating chills and fevers, I prescribed Si Jun Zi Tang, along with Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, and they recovered.</p>
<p>A girl, the granddaughter of Shao Can Wang Yanghu, aged eight, experienced spasms. After taking a remedy to reduce heat and relieve stagnation, her pulse was floating and rapid, with chills and fever resembling malaria. I further applied Si Jun Zi Tang with added Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, roasted Ginger, and Gunteng. Gradually, she began to recover; however, she experienced pain beneath her ribs, so I replaced roasted Ginger with Mu Xiang and Cinnamon, which led to her complete recovery.</p>
<p>A young child fell ill due to the great anger of her wet nurse, experiencing fever and pain beneath the ribs, suffering from the aforementioned symptoms, along with sweating and vomiting. Initially, I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang, and both mother and child took it, leading to an immediate recovery. However, in the afternoon, the child experienced tidal fever, so I treated it with Yigong San, adding Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>One child was ill due to the wet nurse’s fever and vomiting, while another had fallen into a stupor after the nurse ate something harmful. Each child was treated by addressing their mother, and they both fully recovered.<a id="trans-410p" href="#orig-410p" class="marker">[410p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suddenly arched their back, looking up with a face that was both blue and red. The blue indicates liver wind, while the red is fire from the heart. The combination of wind and fire requires the use of Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder, with an added dose of Diaoteng to calm the situation; if phlegm persists, then Baolong pills are to be used for recovery.</p>
<p>Another child unexpectedly arched their back after taking medicine for fright, later frequently experiencing seizures, with a pale yellow and white complexion, and extreme fatigue in limbs. I used Wuwu Yi Gong powder in over ten doses for recovery. Later, due to fright combined with improper diet, they periodically seized again. Using the previous medicine brought about recovery. I then administered powdered Ren and Atractylodes in doses of five to seven fen, boiled with ginger and jujubes, maintaining this until two liang without seizures. In these two cases, the original energy was deficient while the pathogenic energy was substantial; employing harsh medicines against the evil would be a mistake.</p>
<p>A child who had long suffered from the previous condition had a strong phlegm presence, with a complexion pale yet occasional bluish tint. I concluded that the lung qi could not balance the liver, the liver qi was overwhelming the spleen, and the spleen was deficient leading to phlegm. First, I administered Baolong pills twice to calm the liver, followed by Liu Jun Zi decoction to tonify the spleen and lungs, leading to recovery in over a month. Half a year later, the case relapsed, leading me to believe that the phlegm must be purged for full recovery. Consequently, I administered laxatives; phlegm and saliva were profuse, producing a sawing sound in the throat. I stated: the spleen cannot control the saliva. The noise in the throat indicates severe lung qi deficiency. Thus, I used five qian of ginseng and three fen of ginger, decocted in water, allowing them to awaken. After the fourth dose, I added two jujubes and used several liang of ginseng for recovery. In subsequent episodes, only ginseng soup was effective. Adhering strictly to the usual treatments would often result in mistakes.<a id="trans-411p" href="#orig-411p" class="marker">[411p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wang Kentang in &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: In the Eastern Capital, the son of the Wang family experienced diarrhea. Various doctors treated him with purgatives until he became weak, showing symptoms of a lingering fright, such as drowsiness with exposed eyes, coldness in his limbs, and shivering. Qian noted that this was a lingering fright and prescribed Guo Luo Decoction. If the son had strong stomach qi, he would regain consciousness and warmth. Wang doubted that his son had no bowel movements and ordered the doctors to use medications to induce them. The doctors administered Ba Zheng Powder several times, but it was ineffective and his body became cold again. Wang then instructed Qian to help with urination, but Qian advised against it, saying: &quot;Inducing urination would lead to coldness in the body.&quot; After one or two days, the body did indeed become cold. They then carried him out, and Qian remarked: &quot;He cannot eat and has a weak stomach. If we induce bowel movements, both the spleen and stomach will be exhausted, leading to body coldness and closing of the eyes, which could be fatal. Fortunately, the fetal energy is strong and resilient.&quot; Qian used Yi Huang Powder and Shi Jun Zi Pills for four doses, allowing him to drink and eat a little by noon. The reasoning behind this was that inducing bowel movements while the spleen and stomach were weak and cold could lead to further problems; therefore, the spleen should be strengthened rather than attacked separately. Later, he also became mute, and the doctors attempted to treat his lost voice. Qian suggested that since he was mute, how could he open his eyes and eat? Moreover, his teeth were not tightly closed and his mouth was not locked. The doctors were baffled and recommended using Rehmannia to nourish the kidneys. Qian countered that this was due to cooling medications that induced urination, resulting in weakness of both the spleen and kidneys. Now that the spleen was strong but the kidneys were still weak, it was essential to nourish the kidneys gently. After half a month of treatment, he could speak, and within a month, he was healed.<a id="trans-412p" href="#orig-412p" class="marker">[412p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In my youth, I heard my friend Sun Pengshan say: he once saw a young child from his in-laws who suffered from seizures. They sought specialized treatment, and all symptoms subsided, yet he continued to shake his head uncontrollably. Later, an older doctor arrived and added purple river car to the regular medication, and the child was instantly cured. According to the &quot;Shennong Bencao,&quot; purple river car, also known as &quot;Zao Xiu,&quot; is noted in Tang texts as &quot;Jin Xian Chong Lou,&quot; and referred to as &quot;Bai Gan Sui&quot; in the Qian family&#39;s prescriptions, mainly treating seizures, head shaking, and tongue antics.
