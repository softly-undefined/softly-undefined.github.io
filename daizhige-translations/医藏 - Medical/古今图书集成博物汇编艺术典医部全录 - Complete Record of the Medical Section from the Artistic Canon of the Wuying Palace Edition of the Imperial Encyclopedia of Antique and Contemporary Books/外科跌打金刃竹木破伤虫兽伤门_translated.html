<p><strong>Surgery: External Injuries and Broken Bones</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huang Di&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, but the color is not blue; this indicates the condition is due to a fall or impact. Blood is retained beneath the ribs, causing shortness of breath. <em>(Note: The liver governs blood and color; when the pulse is strong but color is not visible, it indicates blood is stored below. The condition arises from falls or injuries caused by impacts, leading to blood clotted under the ribs, hence the shortness of breath.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jinkui Yaolüe</strong> <em>(Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Pulse Signs of Severe Wounds</strong></p>
<p>The pulse at the inch is slightly floating and weak; it indicates loss of blood, similar to sweating. If there is no sweating, the body has wounds caused by knives or axes, resulting in loss of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Classics</strong> <em>(Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe)</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If one falls from a height and has internal bleeding, with abdominal distension, a firm pulse indicates survival; a weak pulse indicates death. If the bleeding from a severe wound is excessive, a weak and fine pulse suggests survival, while a strong and frequent pulse indicates death. If there is bleeding from a severe wound and the pulse is small and deep, survival is more likely; if it is floating and strong, death is likely. If a cut causes bleeding of one or two sheng (a unit of weight), a strong pulse indicates death within twenty days. For continuous bleeding from cuts, a strong and frequent pulse indicates death within seven days; a smooth and fine pulse indicates survival.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Formula - Sun Simiao</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Treating Injuries from Blows</strong></p>
<p>Whenever one is injured from a blow, if blood stagnates and the heart feels compressed, making it impossible to speak, one can pry open the mouth and let urine run into it to induce revival. Similarly, for those who have fallen from a carriage or horse, or have been crushed under wheels and appear dead, one should place the deceased comfortably and cover the mouth, nose, and eyes with a sleeve for a brief moment. After a short while, they may live again, opening their eyes and producing warm urine. </p>
<p><strong>For Treating Metal Wounds</strong></p>
<p>To treat metal wounds, regardless of size or season, as soon as the injury occurs and blood flows, one should apply a thick layer of lime to stop the pain and promote quick healing. If lime is unavailable, ash may be used instead. If the wound is very deep and should not heal quickly, add a bit of talcum powder to prevent closure. Generally, when metal wounds bleed, the person will feel thirsty and should endure it. Eating dry foods or fatty foods to quench the thirst is advised, while avoiding salty foods. If one consumes too much porridge or gruel, it can cause blood to flow excessively and be lethal. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid anger, loud talking, laughter, speculation on yin and yang, physical labor, excessive consumption of sour or salty foods, hot alcohol, and other similar things. Even after the wound heals, these precautions should be observed for at least a hundred days to half a year before returning to normal activities. </p>
<p><strong>Hexi Six Writings - Liu Wansuo</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>On Tetanus</strong></p>
<p>Wind diseases are the beginning of all ailments. When the body is clear and calm, the pores are closed and protected; thus, even when faced with harsh winds and poisons, they cannot cause harm. Hence, tetanus aligns with both the exterior and interior, differentiating between yin and yang, and is treated similarly to typhoid. In humble villages, there are often those who lack knowledge. They only recognize external manifestations and are unaware of conditions that affect the interior or require harmonization. This includes the methods of sweating, purging, and harmonizing, which also align with typhoid symptoms. There are those with conditions on the surface, those within, and those in between. For internal issues, purging is appropriate; for surface conditions, sweating is suitable; and for those in between, harmonization is best. However, sweating and purging must not exceed their limits. Thus, tetanus arises from outside to inside, with more severe internal symptoms indicating a more serious illness. Consequently, injuries from sudden trauma, alongside wind attacks, propagate through the meridians, causing alternating chills and fever, leading to a tightened body and an inability to open the mouth. In severe cases, malign energy enters the organs, necessitating purgative treatment. No sores heal, the vitality is weak, and the flesh does not regenerate; the openings of sores do not close properly, allowing wind pathogens to enter from the outside, resulting in tetanus-like symptoms, hence no sores heal. Alas! The world commonly claims that moxibustion is supreme, but fails to realize that heat from fire and toxic influences disrupt the meridians, leading to countless variations. Mild cases may cause fever, while severe cases can induce wind and spasms, or lead to bent limbs and inability to open the mouth or misaligned eyes, all due to the stagnation of energy and vitality from the sores, preventing proper circulation. There are also cases of tetanus without moxibustion treatment. When a sore has white scabs, the opening closes up, making it difficult for energy to flow and drain; thus, yang heat easily becomes stagnant, and excessive heat can give rise to wind.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Therefore, a floating pulse that is weak indicates the Taiyang (greater yang), a long and strong pulse indicates the Yangming (bright yang), and a floating and thin pulse indicates the Shaoyang (lesser yang). For Taiyang, sweating is appropriate; for Yangming, purging is suitable; and for Shaoyang, harmonizing is the way. If one understands these three methods, and treats without matching the illness, it has never been the case.</p>
<p>For tetanus, when wind-heat is severe and there is stagnation at the surface, but the interior Qi remains balanced, there may be good extension of pulses, with tendons and pulses tight; sometimes there can be a feeling of cold or spasms, with floating, rapid, and thin pulses. In such cases, it is advisable to use warming and spicy herbs to treat the wind, releasing the blockage and achieving recovery. This is akin to treating a surface heat and stagnation of wind-cold with Ma Huang Decoction for warming and dispersing.</p>
<p>In general, when using warming and spicy herbs to open wind-heat stagnation, it is beneficial to assist with cooling herbs to avoid causing illness with the medicinal herbs and worsening the wind-heat condition.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>For treating febrile diseases, herbs such as ephedra, cinnamon twig, huangqin (scutellaria), zhi mu (anemarrhena), and gypsum may be used. If only licorice, talc, green onions, and fermented soybeans are used, they can effectively disperse cold. If the exterior symptoms persist and gradually progress inward, with a slight, wiry pulse indicating that the interior is not yet severely disturbed, one should use herbs to dispel wind-heat and alleviate the stagnant cold, or slightly add dispersing, pungent, and warming herbs. This is akin to using Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) to harmonize when the condition is half exterior and half interior. If the interior condition is severe, with a stiff tongue, locked jaws, backward-arching neck and back, restlessness, spasms, thick and sticky saliva, a feeling of fullness in the chest and abdomen, constipation, or intermittent sweating, with a pulse that is deep, forceful, rapid, and wiry, this indicates that the sweat is caused by wind-heat severely affecting the interior, and the exterior heat has somewhat subsided. Consequently, the pores are open and heart fire is intense, leading to sweating. The treatment principle should involve dispelling wind and relieving the cold blockage, and then applying herbs to dispel wind-heat and alleviate stagnation, allowing the heat to recede, the blockage to disperse, and restoring health.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>Essentials of Living: On Falling Injuries</h3>
<p>When one falls from a height, bad blood accumulates internally and affects the twelve meridians. Physicians often diagnose this as a wind-attack on the liver meridian, with symptoms manifesting in the lower ribs. Blood is primarily governed by the liver, and bad blood will inevitably return to the liver, regardless of which meridian is affected, as the liver is the master of blood. If there is severe pain, it will likely cause sweating. However, since everyone sweats, this is associated with wind disorders, all of which belong to the liver wood. Moreover, with stagnant blood congealed, it counteracts its proper place and enters the liver.</p>
<p>In cases of falling from a height, the upward-acting blood and qi are disturbed; this is attributed to the liver. If there is no sweating, it may not be a cold injury, but once there is sweating, it must be influenced by wind, thus requiring treatment with blood-dispersing herbs.</p>
<p>In situations involving fall from a height or blunt force trauma, where there is accumulated stagnant blood in the chest and abdomen, it is essential to differentiate between the upper, middle, and lower jiao (organs). For the upper region, use formulas like Lao Xijiao Di Huang Decoction. For the middle, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction. For the lower area, something like Didao Decoction can be prescribed. Additionally, these can be combined with urines or wine for decoction.</p>
<p>There are also methods that include raw Rehmannia and Angelica in the decoctions, or those that combine with Da Huang. Individuals with deficiency who cannot withstand purgation may take Siwu Decoction with added pangolin for effective treatment. There&#39;s also Huasui Shi San, which can be prepared with a boy’s urine or taken with wine. </p>
<p>This medicine pairs with previous cold-reducing remedies, emphasizing the importance of discerning between yin and yang. Once the stagnant blood has been resolved, one can take Fuyuantongqi San with added Angelica for further benefit.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trauma and Injuries</strong></p>
<p>For injuries from falls and impacts, one should use Su Mu to invigorate the blood, Huang Lian to reduce heat, Bai Zhu to harmonize the middle, and prepare a decoction of boy&#39;s urine. For injuries below the diaphragm, one should first restore connection and then eliminate the stagnant blood; for those above, it is advisable to drink juice from leeks or consume it mixed with porridge. It is crucial not to drink cold water. If blood encounters cold, it will congeal, and even a single drop of blood entering the heart can lead to death.<br><strong>Tetanus</strong><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Tetanus often results in death; treatment should include wind prevention and scorpions among other remedies. Scorpions are essential; ten should be powdered and mixed with wine, taken three times a day. For blood coagulation and heart issues related to tetanus, burn crow&#39;s wings to ash, grind fine, and mix with one qian (about 3.3 grams) of wine.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falls and Struggles</strong></p>
<p>A fall is called a &quot;diān&quot; when one doesn&#39;t know it, and &quot;pū&quot; when two clash; both result in harm. Those who are dizzy and mentally disturbed from falls and struggles can take Su He Xiang pills mixed with wine, or Jing Ming powder, or a Qi Harmonizing drink with a bit of rhubarb boiled and mixed with vinegar; or use children’s urine to mix with the black spirit powder (or substitute it with liquor boiled with sandalwood). For pain from falls and struggles, mixing wine with amber powder is excellent. Additionally, use Wu Yao to regulate Qi, especially effective for back pain due to falls. If individuals who have fallen take medicine and use inhalation and topical applications without effect, advise them to use equal parts of white peony, red peony, Wei Ling Xian, frankincense, and myrrh, grind them to fine powder, mix with wine and take; this will immediately relieve half of the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Knife Wounds</strong></p>
<p>For knife wounds with uncontrollable bleeding, use only white peony powder mixed with white wine, and apply the powder directly to the wound. If the blood is not flowing freely and is causing stagnation with redness and swelling at the wound, or affecting limbs and head, consider using Jing Ming powder or boiling safflower mixed with black spirit powder. If there is difficult-to-stop bleeding, use dragon bone and frankincense in equal parts, ground to powder and pressed into the affected area; using snake fish grass as a poultice is especially effective. This method is not only good for knife wounds but also for continuous bleeding from falls.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Tetanus</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Wind is the source of all diseases. When the body is clear and pure, the pores are closed, and even strong winds or toxic influences cannot cause harm. However, concerning tetanus, injuries that break the skin and flesh are often regarded as ordinary matters. Little do people realize that the wind pathogen takes advantage of this vulnerability to invade, gradually turning into a severe condition. If sores do not heal properly, the wind pathogen can also invade from within. Whether through bathing in decoctions or cauterizing with moxa, the toxic gas from these methods is not different from the tetanus pathogen. The symptoms can spread through the meridians, burning the vital energy; hence, alternating cold and heat occurs. In severe cases, the jaw may lock, eyes may become misaligned, and the body becomes rigid, resembling a bow drawn tight, leading to death in a short time, which is indeed pitiable. </p>
<p>The method of treatment should align with that of typhoid fever since there are three differing conditions: on the surface, internally, or a combination of both. Therefore, treatment involves sweating for surface conditions, purging for internal conditions, and harmonizing for cases in between. Moreover, one should not exceed these methods. Common folks often do not recognize this condition, making it easy to result in fatality. Delaying medical attention while waiting for the outcome is truly tragic!<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan】</p>
<p><strong>Fractures</strong></p>
<p>Fractures can injure the body, whether from falls, blows, or crushing, causing qi and blood to stagnate and break. Injuries from sharp metal or cuts that cause external bleeding can be treated; however, injuries to internal organs, membranes, or the Yin substance behind the ears are untreatable. </p>
<p>For those who have not bled, it is advisable to use lithospermum to resolve stagnation, Coptis to reduce fire, and Atractylodes to harmonize the middle. These three ingredients should be combined with children’s urine and boiled in wine for oral administration. Those with upper body injuries should consume it with leeks and porridge, while those with lower body injuries may take it directly. If the blood is cold, it will coagulate; one must not drink cold water, as blood entering the heart leads to death.</p>
<p>For resolving stagnation, one can use the Rooster Call Powder, Flower Bud Stone Powder, or Fragrant Wood Qi Harmonization Powder, mixed with children’s urine, red yeast rice, or red wine. If there has been bleeding, quickly use Chen Wang Dan to stop the bleeding. Begin with tonic medicines before resolving stagnation. In cases of extreme deficiency, one must also avoid purging. For blood deficiency, Four Substance Decoction with added pangolin should be used. For Qi deficiency, one may take lithospermum, ginseng, astragalus, danggui, tangerine peel, and licorice for half a month; if the pulse becomes less scattered, one can cautiously take an herbal decoction mixed with natural copper powder on an empty stomach, avoiding it if the bone is not fractured. For substantial deficiency, use purple river car and eliminate musk.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>In cases of injury, the essence lies in replenishing qi and blood; if affected by cold, one should first disperse the cold. Blood issues from injuries primarily pertain to blood itself, unlike the six excesses or seven emotions, which have distinctions in relation to qi and blood. However, since the liver governs blood, regardless of the meridian affected, any stagnant blood will inevitably return to the liver, flowing to the side and causing accumulation in the abdomen, resulting in distension and pain, or alternating cold and heat. In cases of excess, one should purgative; in cases of deficiency, one should use whether to disperse or to restore with blood-activating decoctions, or with the Shiquan Dabu Decoction, adding ingredients like Xiangfu, Chenpi, and Fritillaria in equal parts, decocted in water for consumption.</p>
<p>When an injury suddenly dries out at the wound, and toxins attack internally, leading to confusion, vexation, nausea, and significant bleeding along with persistent vomiting of blood, these are difficult to treat. For early vomiting, use Pingwei Powder taken internally, and apply ginger juice externally. For tetanus-related swelling, Jiangtiao Pills are indicated; if qi is weak, only the honey guiding method should be utilized.</p>
<p>Whether due to excessive initial bleeding or early closure of the wound, leading to stagnant blood, it is all indicative of blood being affected. Blood is yin, governed by the five zang organs; though it may initially be superficial, it quickly penetrates inward, often resulting in death. Therefore, nourishing blood with decoctions like Danggui Dihuang Tang, Huoshen Dan, Tuo Li San, and Neituo Shixuan San can prevent toxin infiltration. Externally, use fish bladder powder, or grind mouse skull into powder and mix with lard for application.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Injury and Trauma</strong></p>
<p>If there is injury accompanied by water retention and a stiff, locked jaw, apply ground oyster as a poultice and take a decoction of licorice, two qian in dosage. Sometimes, a patient may appear to have recovered significantly, only to suddenly experience a stiff jaw and convulsions with phlegm blockage, resembling tetanus or convulsions, but in reality, it is due to deficiency of both qi and blood. </p>
<p>After the rupture and drainage of boils or abscesses, if there is a significant loss of pus and blood, yin disperses and transforms the condition; thus, it is essential to greatly replenish qi and blood. If it truly is a case of wind-tetanus, it is also inappropriate to treat with wind-dispelling medicines. </p>
<p>For those with blood deficiency, use the Four Substances Decoction with added ginseng and atractylodes. For qi deficiency, use the Middle Reinforcing Elixir without spolidang and dried orange peel, adding toasted black berberine, schisandra, ophiopogon, and cinnamon in large doses. </p>
<p>If both qi and blood are deficient, with excessive sweating, thirst, and cold or heat sensations, use the Complete Vitality Decoction, adding cinnamon, aconite, ophiopogon, and schisandra. For hiccups, administer the Warm Middle Decoction. Should one recklessly administer wind-dispelling medications, it may lead to death.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Zhang Chuang (Blister from Beating)</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Chuang should not be treated according to the law. According to ancient methods, breaking the stasis and expelling blood is the priority. After one stroke, drink a mixture of children&#39;s urine and wine; do not consume tea to avoid aggravating the heart with blood. Once the spirit has settled, for those with a robust physique, use Ji Ming San to assist. For those with a weaker constitution, if the sore brings about cold and heat, nausea, or reduced appetite, it is advisable to use a formula of angelica root with additional Chai Hu and Qiang Huo. If there is stagnation of qi, add Mu Xiang; if there is bloating and pain in the heart and abdomen, add children&#39;s urine; if there is fullness beneath the heart and qi is not flowing smoothly, add Mu Xiang and Betel Nut. For external treatment, use hot tofu to cover the affected area; its warmth will promote steaming, and the flesh will turn purple; then cover it again with hot tofu until the purple flesh fades to a light red. This is also appropriate for purulent and decaying wounds. For severe cases, take internal herbal mixtures with myrrh to relieve pain, supplemented with as much hot wine as possible. If the patient is weak, after the sore has healed, it is essential to nourish qi and blood, as well as the spleen and stomach, along with swallowing Zi He Che Dan (a type of tonic), for the best recovery. Externally, apply yellow wax ointment and purslane ointment. If Zhang Chuang suddenly dries out and there is internal toxicity causing abdominal pain, confusion, nausea, and vomiting, it is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h2>Xue&#39;s Medical Case Study</h2>
<h3>Main Treatment Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>For hypochondriac and rib distension with pain, normal bowel movement, and coughing with phlegm, this indicates liver fire injuring the lungs. Use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Qing Pi and Shan Zhi to clear it. If there is abdominal distension with pain, constipation, and coughing up blood, this indicates stagnant blood. Use Dang Gui Da Zhi San to relieve it. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the liver stores blood, and the spleen regulates blood. The liver belongs to wood, which generates fire that harms earth, leading to intense liver fire, which must injure liver blood and weaken spleen qi. First, clear the liver and nourish the blood to prevent stagnant blood from coagulating and tissues from breaking down. Next, strengthen the spleen and enhance digestion so that stagnant flesh can dissipate and new flesh can regenerate. If aggressive measures are taken, the weak will become weaker, and the stagnant will become more stagnant, leading to inevitable disaster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For abdominal pain, or constipation with severe pain upon pressure, this indicates internal stagnant blood. Use modified Cheng Qi Decoction to purge it. If the pain continues after purging and still hurts upon pressure, this indicates that stagnant blood has not been completely cleared. Use modified Si Wu Decoction to tonify and promote its movement. If abdominal pain does not hurt upon pressure, this indicates injury to blood and qi. Use Si Wu Decoction plus Ren Shen, Qi, and Bai Zhu to tonify and harmonize.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>If after a purge there is pain in the chest and sides, it suggests harm to the liver blood; use the Four Gentlemen, Chuanxiong, and Angelica to replenish. If after a purge there is fever, it indicates harm to the yin blood; use the Four Substances, Ginseng, and Atractylodes to replenish. If after a purge there is aversion to cold, it signifies harm to the yang energy; use the Complete Revitalizing Decoction to replenish. If after a purge there is aversion to cold and fever, it suggests damage to both qi and blood; use the Eight Treasures Decoction to replenish. If after a purge there is a desire to vomit, it indicates harm to the stomach qi; use the Six Gentlemen and Angelica to replenish. If after a purge there is diarrhea, it suggests harm to the spleen and kidney; use the Six Gentlemen, Meat Fruit, and Poria to replenish. If after a purge both hands and feet are cold, and there is fainting and sweating, it indicates deficiency of yang energy and cold; urgently use the Ginseng and Aconite Decoction. If there is vomiting and diarrhea with both hands and feet cold and blue nails, it indicates severe deficiency of spleen and kidney cold; urgently use a large dose of Ginseng and Aconite Decoction. If there is locked jaw, difficulty moving hands, involuntary urination, abundant phlegm, blue lips, and cold body, it indicates extreme deficiency with external signs; urgently administer a large dose of Ginseng and Aconite Decoction, many have been saved with this.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>When there is pain between the muscles, it indicates stagnation of the vital energy in the Ying and Wei; use the Recovery and Qi-Releasing Powder. When there is pain in the sinews and bones, it indicates damage to the liver and kidney energy; use the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. If there is internal bleeding causing pain, it indicates deficiency of the spleen and stomach energy; use the Spleen-Boosting Qi-Tonifying Decoction. If there is external injury causing bleeding and pain, it indicates deficiency of the spleen and lung energy; use the Eight-Treasure Decoction. Generally, if there is persistent bleeding, it indicates collapse of the spleen and stomach energy. If there is vomiting and diarrhea without appetite, it indicates failure of the spleen and stomach energy. If one takes preventive measures to regulate and nourish the spleen and stomach, such issues will not occur.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the pain persists for four to five days without relief, or recurs after one or two days, becoming pustular, use the Suppressing and Expelling Toxin Powder. If pressing down on it causes it to swell again, and pus has formed, incision to drain the pus will relieve the pain. If headaches occur intermittently, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood; if the pain is accompanied by dizziness, it relates to phlegm. Hence, nourish the liver blood and replenish the spleen energy.</p>
<p>If a swelling does not dissipate, use the Spleen-Boosting Qi-Tonifying Decoction to strengthen qi; if the swelling is dark and does not go away, use the Enhanced Relaxing Decoction to disperse blood. If there is heat, swelling, and pain, indicating stagnation of blood resulting in pus, use the Eight-Treasure Decoction with added Angelica to assist in drainage. If the pus has ruptured and there is subsequent pain, it indicates qi and blood deficiency; use the Ten-Complete Great Tonifying Decoction to replenish.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>If the bone reconnects but then dislocates again, it indicates liver and kidney deficiency, treated with Rehmannia Pill. If swelling does not subside and the color does not change, it suggests deficiency of qi and blood; internally use Eight Treasures Decoction and externally apply shallot poultices to disperse the blood stasis, gradually reducing swelling and pain. If blood flows and breaks, the spleen and stomach become more deficient, and the movement of qi becomes stagnated. If cool external medicines are applied, blood stasis worsens, internal decay deepens, leading to complicated issues.</p>
<p>For a fever that arises from excessive bleeding or after pus drains, with a rapid and weak pulse that feels empty upon pressing, this indicates yin deficiency leading to fever; use Angelica Blood Supplement Decoction. If the pulse is deep and weak, it reflects an excess of yin leading to agitation; use Four Gentlemen with ginger and prepared Aconite. If fever and agitation arise with muscle twitching and tendons being tense, it signifies loss of blood; use Sheng Yu Decoction. If sweating is unceasing, leading to blood loss, use Alone Ginseng Decoction. If blood loss presents a strong pulse, while a restless pulse after sweating is difficult to treat, a thin and weak pulse is easier to manage. </p>
<p>According to &quot;Essentials from the Outer Chamber&quot;: when excess yin leads to agitation and one desires to sit in a well, use Aconite Four-Negative Decoction with shallot white. Wang Taifu states that any heat emerging and receding, appearing by day and hiding by night, and moving unpredictably is termed &quot;rootless fire,&quot; indicating formless heat deficiency.</p>
<p>For vomiting, if due to severe pain or due to obstructing factors that harm the stomach, use Four Gentlemen, Angelica, Pinellia, and ginger. If arising from anger harming the liver, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Gardenia and Poria. If from phlegm-heat excess, use Er Chen Decoction with fried Coptis and Gardenia. If due to stomach qi deficiency, use Supplement Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction with fresh ginger and Pinellia.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If there is excessive bleeding or due to abscess rupture, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with Angelica. </p>
<p>If there is wheezing and coughing, and if there is excessive bleeding accompanied by a black face, chest fullness, or chest pain causing wheezing, it indicates an accumulation of qi and blood in the lungs; urgently use Er Wei Shen Su Decoction. If there is coughing up blood or nosebleeds, it suggests qi rebellion and blood accumulation in the lungs; urgently use Shi Wei Shen Su Decoction with Gardenia, Scutellaria, Lian, and Chuanxiong.</p>
<p>If there is thirst due to excessive bleeding, use Si Wu, Ren Shen, and Bai Zhu; if ineffective, use Ren Shen and Huang Qi to tonify qi, and Angelica and Shu Di to nourish blood. If due to abscess rupture, use Ba Zhen Decoction. If stomach heat injures body fluids, use Bamboo Leaf and Huang Qi Decoction. If the stomach is weak and fluids are insufficient, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If stomach fire is excessive, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If there is thirst from heat, with scanty urination, it indicates虚 heat in the kidney meridian, which can only be remedied by the use of Dihuang Wan. </p>
<p>If there is bleeding, whether it occurs from the affected area or orifices, it suggests an excess of liver fire and blood heat misdirecting, requiring the use of a modified Xiaoyao San to clear heat and nourish blood. </p>
<p>If there is weakness of the middle energy, causing blood to improperly flow, use a modified Four Gentlemen Decoction or the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>If the original energy has been depleted, failing to contain the blood, use a decoction of Ginseng with roasted ginger to restore yang; if there is no response, quickly add Aconite. </p>
<p>If blood is congealed internally causing vomiting of blood, use the Four Substances Decoction with Chai Hu and Huang Qin. </p>
<p>Generally, injuries, over-exertion, or anger leading to abdominal distension, may result from mistakenly taking harsh medicines like Dahuang, damaging the yang channels which leads to vomiting of blood, nosebleeds, or blood in the urine; while damage to the yin channels can result in blood accumulation and clots. </p>
<p>If the muscles are dark and bluish, this indicates a deficiency in the spleen and lungs, causing loss of function in the channels; prompt replenishment of the spleen and lungs can still restore health.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>But if the patient does not understand this principle and does not use this method, it is a pity! When the hands and feet are injured and the vital energy is weak, whether due to excessive sexual activity, recklessly engaging in laborious tasks, leading to necrosis or non-painful festering, dark and unhealing conditions, one should greatly nourish the vital energy to preserve life. If the joints of the hands and feet are severed, it is not a concern. Bones may be broken, but tendons can reconnect, and there is no need to rush in cutting off; if it affects healthy flesh, then it is untreatable. If one takes preventative measures to supplement the spleen&#39;s energy, there will be no such issues. Generally, if there is internal festering pus or stagnation, one should use needles to disperse it from within. If there is jaw stiffness and difficulty urinating resembling tetanus, urgently use the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction with added Aconite, and there are many who survive.</p>
<p>If the necrotic flesh does not ulcerate, or is accompanied by chilliness without ulceration, use the Middle-Nourishing and Energy-Increasing Decoction; if there is fever without ulceration, use the Eight Treasures Decoction. If it does not ulcerate due to excessive repression, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Angelica. If the outer skin is black and hard without ulceration, it is due to internal heat steaming; take the Eight Treasures Decoction internally and apply Angelica ointment externally. If the dead flesh cannot ulcerate, or if new flesh cannot grow leading to death, it is due to the failure to preemptively supplement the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>If new flesh cannot regenerate, and the afflicted area is pale, it indicates weak spleen energy; use the Six Gentlemen, Chuanxiong, and Angelica. If the afflicted area is bright red, it indicates deficient yin blood; use the Four Substances Decoction, Ginseng, and Atractylodes. If there is chill and fever, indicating Qi and blood deficiency, use the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction. If the pus is thin and white and does not grow, it suggests deficiency in spleen and lung Qi; use the Middle-Nourishing and Energy-Increasing Decoction. If the pus and blood are red and do not grow, it indicates deficiency in heart and spleen blood; use Dongyuan Shengyu Decoction.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>When there is no response to cold and heat, it is due to liver fire movement; use a modified Xiaoyao San. If there is afternoon heat without response, it is due to liver blood deficiency; use the Eight Treasures Decoction and peony root. If there is little appetite and fatigue without response, it indicates spleen and stomach qi deficiency; use the Six Gentlemen Decoction. For purulent and filthy conditions without response, it signifies yin deficiency with pathogenic fire; use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill. If the limbs feel heavy and the spirit is lacking without response, this indicates inner injury to original qi; use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. In summertime, use the Diao Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for diarrhea, use the Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction. In autumn, for diarrhea use the Qing Zao Decoction.</p>
<p>For severe injury with confusion, urgently administer the Single Ginseng Decoction; if there is internal stagnant blood, do not purge, but quickly use Huai Rui Stone Powder for internal transformation, fearing the loss of yin due to purging. If original qi is severely deficient, it is especially inappropriate to purge; continue to use the prior powder for transformation. In all cases of internal stagnant blood with constipation, use Da Huang and Qing Phragmites Crude; if blood has coagulated and does not descend, urgently use aromatic herbal powders like Mu Xiang and Rou Gui in warm wine to administer, so blood will descend and then vitality will arise. For weak individuals, use salts and yellow essence with Rou Gui and Mu Xiang, boiling together, exploiting its heat to disperse the cold.</p>
<p>For severe constipation, if there is blood deficiency in the large intestine and excessive heat, use the Four Herbs Decoction to accompany Run Chang Wan, or use pig bile to guide it. If there is renal deficiency with dry heat, use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill. If there is qi deficiency in the intestines and stomach, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>For injuries that require the use of black sheep skin, it is because sheep&#39;s nature is hot and can supplement qi. If the injury from a blow is severe, and the flesh inside has decayed, apply it to promote ulceration; this will quickly lead to purulence.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If there are no internal supplements to strengthen the foundation, toxic energy may invade internally; if there are no external methods to puncture and release the stagnant impurities, good flesh may still be harmed. If light punishment results in superficial skin hurt, it is best to apply Angelica ointment, along with the herbs Siwu, Qin, Lian, Chaihu, Shanzhi, Baizhu, and Fuling. Additionally, if scabs do not form, wounds do not fester, and dead blood disperses by itself, swelling and pain will ease naturally. However, if a comprehensive approach is taken to cover and apply everything, it fosters toxic stagnation.</p>
<p>If after jumping, pounding the chest, twisting, lifting, or laboring there is chest and abdominal pain, and there is a desire to touch the hurt area, it is liver fire injuring the spleen, for which the formula of Four Gentlemen, Chaihu, and Shanzhi is used. If there is a fear of touch, indicating blood stagnation in the liver meridian, one should use Siwu, Chaihu, Shanzhi, Taoren, and Honghua. If there is pain in the chest and ribs, fever in the daytime, it indicates liver blood damage, for which the modified Xiao Yao San is used. If there’s pain in the chest and ribs with reduced appetite, it indicates injury to liver and spleen qi, so the Four Gentlemen, Xiong, Gui, Chai, Zhi, and Danpi should be taken. If there’s fullness in the chest and abdomen with diminished appetite, indicating stagnation of liver and spleen qi, one should use Six Gentlemen with added Chaihu, Xiong, and Gui. If there is no ease in the chest and abdomen, little appetite, and insomnia, indicating spleen qi stagnation, the modified Gui Pi Decoction should be used. If phlegm qi is stagnant, indicating stagnation of spleen and lung qi, one should use Erchen, Baizhu, Xiong, Gui, Zhi Zi, and Qingpi. If teeth gnash and convulsions occur, indicating strong liver and weak spleen, Xiao Chaihu Decoction, Chuanxiong, Shanzhi, Tianma, and Diaoteng must be used. Using windy medicinal herbs may further injure liver blood and exacerbate liver fire; drinking sugary liquor may additionally weaken kidney water, intensifying the liver fire.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If you use drugs like rhubarb, it may harm the Yin channels internally and lead to bleeding. For the young and strong, this could result in chronic diseases, while the old and weak may suffer greatly. </p>
<p>For a tetanus injury, Hejian states: Wind syndromes can change rapidly, and if they invade the organs, mortality can be imminent, so it is crucial to quickly discern the exterior and interior conditions to treat accordingly. If the pathogen is in the exterior, the sinews and vessels may become tense, occasionally alternating between cold and heat, with spasms in the muscles and a floating, wiry pulse; use Qianghuo and Fangfeng decoction to disperse it. </p>
<p>If it&#39;s a condition that is half exterior and half interior, there may be slight sweating on the forehead but none on the body; treat with Qianghuo decoction. If it has penetrated to the interior, symptoms like a stiff tongue, locked jaw, tense neck and back, muscle spasms, excessive phlegm, a sensation of fullness and heaviness in the chest and abdomen, and difficulty urinating with crimson urine may present; in this case, there may be occasional sweating and a rapid, floating pulse, so use Daqinghuang decoction to guide it out. If there is already a bowel movement and sweating continues, the exterior is weak; therefore, use Baizhu and Fangfeng decoction to replenish it, and periodically administer gruel as well.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>What has been previously stated concerns the method of treating conditions where the qi is still empty but has not been damaged. If there is a large loss of pus and blood, with yang dispersing along with yin, resulting in both qi and blood being deficient, and the symptoms resemble those mentioned earlier, it is essential to greatly tonify the spleen and stomach, and completely avoid medicines that dispel wind.</p>
<p>Regarding spasms, Zhongjing stated that all spasms with a stiff neck are due to dampness. He also mentioned that excessive sweating in the case of a taiyang disease can lead to spasms. In cases of wind diseases, purging can cause spasms to recur, and sweating can lead to a feeling of tightness. If a patient has sweated but does not feel cold, it is termed &quot;soft spasms,&quot; as wind can disperse qi; the recommended treatment is Baizhu Decoction with added cassia twigs and astragalus. If there is no sweating but the patient feels cold, it is termed &quot;hard spasms,&quot; as cold can congeal blood; the recommended treatment is Gegen Decoction. These conditions arise from internal injuries to blood and qi, where the tendons are not properly nourished, and are not caused by wind. </p>
<p>For those with ulcerated wounds or injuries that lead to variations in qi and blood, it is necessary to tonify both blood and qi; the appropriate treatment is to use Dushen Decoction. If the hands and feet are cold, add cassia and asarum; if the condition is alleviated but not resolved, it requires further intervention.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Injuries</strong></p>
<p>The discussion on injuries states: Injuries must be traced back to their source, examining the severity of the condition and the depth of the damage. In a person&#39;s body, from head to toe, there are cuts, bruises, falls, and various injuries from sharp objects. Each of these injuries has its own explanations; for a physician, it is crucial to understand both the internal and external aspects before administering treatment. However, if a physician lacks understanding, they cannot be considered a competent healer. Some individuals may be naturally dull-witted, unable to assess the severity of symptoms or the depth of injuries, and may hastily administer treatments without proper understanding, causing great harm. This can lead to phlegm and fluids attacking upwards or cause obstructions in the internal organs, where a minor mistake can result in significant consequences. Thus, the saying goes: &quot;A physician should not be trusted without careful prescribing; the treatment should not be taken lightly!&quot; This serves as a fundamental guideline for treating injuries. While it is essential to apply the correct medications, it is even more critical to execute treatments with precision. The human body has a total of 365 joints, which are itemized as follows.</p>
<p><strong>List of Joints</strong></p>
<p>The human body consists of 365 joints, with the first 165 corresponding to significant connections; starting from the clavicle upwards and including the head, extending to the front and back, there are 49 corresponding connections, totaling 72.

The layer of resting bones comprises ten bones called the gripping bones, both sides counted the same. Next to the gripping bones are ten bones called the assisting strength bones, both sides counted the same. To the left, the assistance is represented by claws, and to the right, by armor. </p>
<p>Below the claws and armor, there are supporting bones, totaling ten, without power or fluid. Furthermore, the angle bones below, accounting for front and back to the initial step, represent one hundred thirty-six bones totaling fifty-one characters, from here down to the area beneath the breasts, branching left and right at the meeting of the bones in both feet. Below the angle, there is one bone known as the heart-covering bone, which has no marrow. To the left of the angle is the rib bone, with a total of twelve above and below, corresponding to the division of the small intestine. At the end of the left rib, there are supporting hidden rib bones, also ranked as twelve, without marrow. Beneath the rib bones, there are two seasonal rib bones, which contain more fluid.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>At the end of the season of Qi, there are two hidden bones associated with it, without marrow. To the right of the bones, there are twelve ribs, corresponding to the division of the sun. Below the ribs, there are two lesser ribs, each without hidden bones, which only beasts have. At the end of the right rib, there are twelve hidden ribs, without marrow. Before the iliac bone, there is one large transverse bone, with a slight quantity of marrow. Before the transverse bone, there are two white ring bones, each with strength and some fluid. Before the white rings, there are two inner support bones, left and right, each possessing strength and some fluid, as above. Behind the inner supports, there are two skeletal joint bones, left and right, as above. Below the skeletal joints, there are two lever bones, left and right.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Below the femur bone, there are two pelvic bones on each side, with significant marrow. Below the pelvic bones are two patellae, with not much liquid. On each side of the patella, there are two fibulae, with significant liquid. Below the pelvic bones, there are two tibiae, with significant marrow. Outside the tibiae, there are two outer accessory bones, with significant presence of liquid, and the same applies below. Below the tibiae, there are two standing bones, one on each side. Each standing bone has two inner and outer ankle bones, totaling four, with little liquid. In front of the ankle bones, there are ten metatarsal bones, with significant liquid. Behind the ankle bones, there are two heel bones, with little liquid. In front of the metatarsal bones and in front of the talus, there are ten bones called &quot;qipus,&quot; with significant presence. In front of the &quot;qipus,&quot; there are ten supporting bones, with significant presence.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Before the flat assistance, there were supporting bones, ten in total on both sides, without much potency or liquid. In the two sides of the explanation, there were core bones, two on both sides, with more potency and liquid. Below the starting servant, there were initial bones, two on both sides, with power but no marrow or liquid. Women lack these bones. In total, there are three hundred sixty-five bones. When heaven and earth interact, only humans possess the utmost spirit. Women, however, do not have the top authority. Apply blood dispersing ointment for wounds. If there are bruises or injuries without broken skin, use flesh capturing ointment for application. For cuts or injuries around the upper lip caused by knives or axes, use a small strip of silk to bind at the back of the head and bring it forward to stitch and set; then apply sealing medicine at the mouth, and externally use blood dispersing ointment. For realigning the lower lip, a silk strip should be tied under the chin and adjusted as done previously, then apply powdered medicine. If there is no swelling, no ointment is needed. If someone playfully bites down on a knife and accidentally damages the tongue, if not completely severed, use sealing medicine and change it two or three times a day, fully healing in seven to eight days.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>For injuries to the two salivary glands caused by cuts or blows, if the gland is opened, stitch it up with silk thread and apply a sealing medicine. Then, use a hemostatic ointment externally. In seven to eight days, if the flesh bonds, remove the stitches and apply the sealing medicine.</p>
<p>For teeth struck, knocked, or broken, if a tooth is lost, only use a muscle-repair powder and the sealing medicine. Also, take blood-stopping and pain-relieving medicine, using decoction with water; it is not advisable to use wine for decoction. This method is known to be very effective.</p>
<p>For broken teeth from blows or cuts, if the teeth are not displaced, use powdered hibiscus ointment. If the teeth are loose, grind the root of a thistle and use it as powder—apply it regularly to stabilize the teeth.</p>
<p>For throat cuts, hold the patient&#39;s head with your foot, sew the internal throat with silk thread first, then sew the external skin of the neck, and apply sealing medicine externally, using hemostatic ointment to dress the wound and change the dressing. If the throat is bent from a blow, align it by hand and then apply ointment. However, if the throat injury is severe and the soft tissue is torn, it is untreatable. If the patient can ingest soup, cure is possible. If it comes out, it is incurable.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>In cases of injury to the neck, shoulder, and ribs from falling from a height: if the neck bone is dislocated, take a towel and a rope, tie them from the roof to hang down, and use the towel to secure under the chin, tying it at the back of the head. Tighten the knot, and place a five or six-inch tall jar underneath, adjusting the height for the patient to sit upright on it with their feet extended. The practitioner should carefully manipulate the alignment while speaking to keep the patient unaware, and then with a kick, knock the jar away. If it&#39;s on the left side, use the left hand to assist; if on the right, use the right hand. Apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relief ointment. </p>
<p>Another method: have the patient lie on the bed while another person pressures their head, with both feet stepping on the shoulders to assist in repositioning. </p>
<p>If the shoulder bones are dislocated, and the bone is sticking out in front, use a towel to bind the wrists at the chest; if protruding from the back, bind the wrists behind. If the left is out and tilts towards the right arm, push it in; if the right is out and tilts towards the left arm, do the same. Apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relief ointment to both sides. </p>
<p>For injuries to the shoulder well and below the ribs, do not bind; simply apply pressure to realign them, using meat-repair ointment, bone-setting ointment, and pain-relief ointment for treatment. The same applies to the rib bones.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Any time there is a dislocation of the shoulder bones, one should assess the condition and how to set it. Use a chair for the affected person to reach out with both hands into the left cavity, the right shelf, and the five basic bones, totaling three hundred sixty bones. Furthermore, there are one hundred ninety bones in men and women, some hidden, some supporting, and some lacking marrow; the remaining two hundred fifty-six bones have marrow fluid that is stored in the muscles, meeting the pulses and valleys, needed to form the body’s shape, referred to as the four greats. This is the standard for bone measurement.</p>
<p>For injuries to the head, eyes, nose, or ears: If the cranial bones are fractured, apply light pressure to stabilize them. If the skin is intact, use anti-swelling ointment for application. If the skin is broken and flesh is damaged, first use a sealing medicine to treat it, then apply a hemostatic ointment outside. If there is bleeding, use a hemostatic powder to treat it. For swelling and pain, apply mashed kudzu leaves, hair vine leaves, or the tails of maple leaves, ensuring that they do not come in contact with wind or water, for fear of developing tetanus.</p>
<p>Fractured cranial bones located at the temples can be treated. However, injuries at the temples themselves cannot be treated. If the injury is near the hairline, one must cut or shave the hair and check whether the skin is broken. Based on that, apply the appropriate medicine as previously described.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If you wish to wash, it is appropriate to use cooked oil mixed with medicinal water, or wash with warm tea. For facial wounds that are bruised and dark, apply a purple powder, or adhere with a purple gold ointment. For more severe wounds, use a flesh-repairing ointment for application. </p>
<p>For injuries at the corners of the head or the back of the neck, or on the eyebrows, they can be treated. If the eyes are injured and the pupils are intact, they can be treated. If the eyelids are bruised and dark, apply a purple powder, or a purple gold ointment. For severe cases, use a flesh-repairing ointment for application. If there is damage to the top of the head, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>For injuries at the nostrils that are concave, they can be treated. Blood loss is not a concern. If the bridge of the nose is bruised and sunk from impact, use a flesh-repairing ointment. If the nostrils are affected and have opened wounds from a fall, or from cuts or blows, apply sealing medicine to the wound and use a blood-dispelling ointment on the outside to reduce swelling.</p>
<p>For injuries to the ears from blows or falls, or if the upper part separates from the lower part or vice versa, use sealing medicine for internal treatment and a blood-dispelling ointment for external application. For ears that are detached, use a goose feather to hold them in place, and secure them with a bamboo clamp. When binding, ensure the ears are aligned and bind gently.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>In case of injuries to the tongue, lips, mouth, throat, teeth, and jaw: for cuts caused by blades, axes, or falls that break the skin and flesh, first sew the wound with mulberry bark thread, then apply sealing medicament. Next, use blood-stanching ointment for dressings, ensuring the sealing medicament remains intact and advising the patient to speak less. </p>
<p>For injuries where the lip, ear, or nose are broken and missing, apply sealing medicament and outside of it, place blood-stanching ointment. If a part of the lip or ear is missing, first apply anesthetic, then use scissors to trim some outer skin, and sew with silk thread. For a missing ear, suture it in two sections; for a missing lip, suture in three sections. Apply egg yolk butter and then sprinkle a little golden dog hair on top, followed by more sealing medicament. The next day, gently wash with tea and apply sealing medicament again. </p>
<p>Change the dressing once a day, and after eight days, cut the stitches and reapply sealing medicament.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>For injuries to the cheeks, jaw, or those caused by cuts and falls that break the skin, use sealing medicine to fill the wound, and apply a brace on the outside. Secure it with the hands, and use soft cloth to support underneath. Have one person hold it steady while two others stretch and reposition it. If it falls, bend the wrist again, stabilize it, and apply pain-relief and bone-setting ointments, then bind it with silk cloth.</p>
<p>For hand injuries: there are four bones in the hand that can dislocate and six joints. In the case of a dislocated arm, the upper segment is the joint, and the lower segment is the handle. The tendons around may also be damaged, causing dislocation. This bone must be pulled straight; one person pulls while another holds the bone steady to guide it back in place. Observe which side the bone has moved to, and use a piece of bamboo to hold one side, leaving the other side free, focused on the bent and straight portions. After applying medicine, do not let it be stable; continue to adjust as needed. Because there are many tendons here, if it is not straightened after the medicine, it may lead to complications, making the hand unable to move properly later on.</p>
<p>For dislocations at the shoulder: if the arm bone is dislocated downward, the body joint socket is dislocated upward, and it can occur on the left or right. Use a pestle and a low stool. Have the patient stand on the stool, using the pestle to push against the dislocated area. If lower, use something to lift it. If the pestle is long, adjust the stool. Have one person hold it steady, while another pulls the arm down from the stool, and another holds the pestle, guiding the patient to sit down to align the joint. This method is effective.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If a small stool is not available, position two small ladders opposite each other. Insert a wooden stick through the legs of both ladders and hold the stick firmly in the middle. Let yourself fall from above onto the area where the bones dislocated under the armpit, and the joints will naturally return to their socket.</p>
<p>For a dislocated wrist, straighten and pull out the bones. The physician should lift the wrist while stabilizing the patient&#39;s knee, applying pressure at the neck and shoulder to return the bones to their proper place. Then, apply pain-relieving ointment and bone-setting ointment. If the wrist is displaced, whether upwards or downwards, pull it gently, ensuring the hand is secured, and then apply the aforementioned ointment and bandage it.</p>
<p>If the wrist bones are out, turn a round chair upside down and use your foot to hold the chair down. Adjust the patient&#39;s hand within the chair to align the wrist properly, using a small book to stabilize it. Then apply the ointment and wrap it in silk cloth, ensuring the palm faces upwards while binding. If the hand is dislocated, do not pull or extend it; instead, support it with clothing from below, gently shaking and adjusting it to realign. Lastly, apply the ointment and secure it with a brace, ensuring an additional lining is used below.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Whenever a hand bone protrudes to the left, the physician should use the right hand to pull it back in; if the bone protrudes to the right, the physician should use the left hand. After extending and contracting, shaking it two or three times, apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment, then bandage tightly.</p>
<p>If only one side of the hands or feet is broken, it can be treated; however, if both hands and feet are broken, it cannot be treated. For broken hand or foot bones, bind them tightly in the middle, and allow the ends to be slightly looser to gather qi and blood at the break.</p>
<p>If binding the hand, leave the front end looser to allow blood to disperse. If binding the foot, leave the lower end looser to allow qi and blood to disperse downwards.</p>
<p>For a downward protrusion of the palm, turn the palm upward. The physician should manipulate the injured area, bending the palm outward to make it even, then apply ointment and bind it. For the back of the hand, a longer piece of cloth is placed on the outer back; for the palm, a shorter piece is placed at the pressing point. A longer piece is placed at the curve of the little finger; a shorter piece is placed at the bony part of the thumb, with three layers of binding.</p>
<p>For broken bones in both arms, those with shattered bones can be distinguished from those broken without shattering. All can use pain-relieving ointment and bone-setting ointment for application.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>For injuries to the fingers caused by falls, cuts, or being struck by axes, apply chicken egg yolk oil, then sprinkle with sealing powder, and cover with a hemostatic ointment, securing it with a silk cloth. If there are bites or abrasions, use lamb&#39;s ear powder for dressing; if there are symptoms of cold or fever, use a fever-reducing powder for application, and the cold or fever will subside.</p>
<p>For dislocated wrists, when the bones become interlocked or dislocated from the socket, it may be necessary to realign the bones back into place. If the bone is dislocated towards the outside, it must be pushed inward; if it has gone inward, it must be brought outward to return to the socket. Simply pulling with one&#39;s hands might result in a difficult reduction, leading to a chronic condition. It is advisable to use bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment for application and binding. For fractured bones, use fir bark and bamboo strips for support; for dislocations, only use cloth for binding without clamps, and it is important to keep moving it regularly to avoid stiffness; prolonged immobility may hinder proper healing.</p>
<p>For chest and side injuries: If there is a dislocated bone in the chest, the patient should rest on a firm surface. The physician should stand by and step on the patient&#39;s feet with their own, then reach under the patient&#39;s arm to cross over the back and embrace the patient&#39;s back. With one hand, lift the chest (specifically the bone at the chest) to allow it to return to place, and subsequently apply pain-relieving ointment and bone-setting ointment.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Whenever there is a bruise or injury to the chest bones, with external swelling and internal pain, apply a pain-relieving ointment externally and use blood dispersing medicine internally to eliminate stagnant blood. Then, consume a decoction of blood-soothing herbs mixed with wine. For knife wounds, first stabilize the bones and align the skin, ensuring they are smooth and straight, then apply sealing ointment to close the wound. Externally, use a muscle-repairing powder mixed with egg whites for dressing, and internally take restorative and blood-activating medicines.</p>
<p>For broken chest ligaments, first apply blood-dispersing medicine, then use pain-relieving ointment and bone-setting ointment for dressing. If there is a skin break, apply a flesh-repairing ointment.</p>
<p>For severe injuries to the chest and sides where blood does not flow, use mung bean juice mixed with ginger for ingestion. It is advisable to have a strong person behind to compress and help expel the blood, followed by blood-dispersing medicine.</p>
<p>If the abdomen is injured and the skin is torn, with the intestines protruding, it is difficult to treat if the intestines are completely severed; however, if they are torn but not completely cut, they can be treated. </p>
<p>For protruding intestines, have the patient place their hand on the physician&#39;s shoulder and curl the intestines back in while applying sesame oil to lubricate the wound. Once returned to the abdomen, use a laxative powder to induce sneezing, allowing the intestines to retract naturally. Use mulberry bark thread to suture the inner skin, then apply sealing medicine to the wound, and externally use a muscle-repairing powder mixed with egg whites for dressing.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>If there is bleeding, a more excellent treatment is the application of blood-stopping powder. It should be applied with flower milk stone. </p>
<p>For a stomach that has split open, use hemp thread for stitching, or use mulberry bark as thread, and also apply flower milk stone powder to the stitches. The internal stitching of the stomach should be done from the inside; do not stitch from the outside, leaving the outer skin open. Apply medicine and wait for the flesh to grow back.</p>
<p>If there is a small perforation in the intestine, shine a light on it. If there is gas escaping from it, it cannot be treated. </p>
<p>Another method: if the intestine is protruding, lift the patient’s hands, and have them swallow a mouthful or two of vinegar brewed with mountain bean root, then pierce a needle into the patient’s neck, and the intestine will retract by itself.</p>
<p>For injuries with large openings in the stomach, where both the intestine and fatty tissue are protruding, if placed back inside, it should be stitched; if the opening is small and only the fat is out, use your hands to push the fat away without stitching. The protruding fat is already useless and should not be returned to the stomach as it would cause further harm; just push it aside without concern. This is known as seen flesh, and you can safely remove it. </p>
<p>For internal injuries, focus on treating the small and large intestines specifically; do not delay, for it may lead to serious issues.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Injuries to the waist, hips, thighs, and knees: Whenever the lumbar bones are fractured, place a piece of door on the ground, with one end elevated. Have the patient lie on it, extending their hands up to grasp the door, while three people pull and stretch from below. Apply pressure to the injured area for a prolonged period. Then use pain-relieving ointment and bone-setting ointment for application. If the patient moves their body throughout the night, by the next day the affected area should be pain-free, allowing them to turn freely; still, use the blood-stabilizing medicine.</p>
<p>For dislocations of the hip joint, where the right bone protrudes into the left and vice versa, push the foot in, steadying and aligning it carefully, and apply medicine. If the injury is inward, have the patient cross their legs and press on their shoulders, while the doctor uses their knee to push in; even though there may be significant pain for a moment, it will not matter. Realign it properly and then apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment. The patient should lie on their back and should not turn onto their side, as excessive movement may lead to further injury.</p>
<p>For injuries to the waist and legs, use alcohol in combination with blood circulation medicines, and always add eucommia bark.</p>
<p>For dislocation of the hip bone from the upper buttock, have two to three people hold the legs steady and pull to stretch, using their feet to support the person. Apply the aforementioned ointments. If the dislocation is deep within the groin area, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Injuries to the bones of the foot are very challenging to realign and will require careful assessment at the moment; it’s hard to make a definitive statement.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>For cases where both legs have suffered fractures, use manual techniques to realign the bones. Pull upwards seven parts in front and five parts in the back, then secure it in place. Apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relief ointment, and bind it. When binding, first secure the middle, then the top and bottom, using an external brace. If there is swelling and pain in the upper and lower parts, change the dressing only after five days.</p>
<p>To distinguish between internal and external dislocations of the hip joint, if there is no swelling at the knee, it indicates an inward dislocation; push inwards from the inside to align properly. If the knee is stuck and cannot open, it indicates an outward dislocation; push inwards from the outside to align properly, adapting to the situation.</p>
<p>For a dislocated ankle, have the patient sit comfortably. The practitioner should use their foot to press and shift the affected leg, while simultaneously gripping and shaking a couple of times. Then apply bone-setting ointment or injury ointment.</p>
<p>For knee injuries, after applying pressure to realign, use ointment on the front and secure with mulberry bark as a four-point wrap. If the kneecap is dislocated, use a bamboo brace to stabilize it, applying medication and securing it in place. It&#39;s crucial to apply the four-point wrap; otherwise, the knee will not stabilize. If there is swelling and pain, a needle or knife may need to be used to release blood, followed by medication and binding.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>If there is an injury from falling on the ankle bones or from the left and right foot, it should be straightened and pulled back in place using the foot, then pressed flat and treated with a topical plaster. If the knee cap dislocates, do not pull it too straight or too bent. If pulled straight, the bony edges aren’t visible, and the same applies if bent. It should be held halfway straight and halfway bent, using a bamboo hoop to secure the knee cap and binding it with rope. </p>
<p>For any fractures or dislocations of the joints, whether from falls affecting the arms, waist, or knees, one must use proper techniques to realign them. First, administer an anesthetic to eliminate pain, and only then can the hands be used to treat the injury. </p>
<p>For foot injuries, there are six dislocations and four fractures. Whenever there is a dislocation at the junction on the sole of the foot, someone must pull it while the other person manually adjusts the joint. If a bone is protruding inward, it should be pulled outward gently; conversely, if it is protruding outward, it must be forcefully pulled back inward to return it to its proper position. Merely pulling without adjusting the joint will cause chronic issues. It is advisable to apply bone-setting ointment and pain relief plaster. </p>
<p>For strapping: in the case of the four fractures, use proper and additional bindings; for the six dislocations, only fabric wraps are suitable, without binding. </p>
<p>For knee dislocations, the treatment is similar to that of the arm or elbow dislocations. Whether the dislocation is inward or outward, only one side should be secured. This area has a large number of tendons and meridians, so it requires constant attention and care. It is advisable to apply bone-setting ointment and pain relief plaster while securing the joint.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>For a dislocated hip joint, the bones at this part of the body resemble a mortise, and the thigh root acts as a pestle. Whether it dislocates forward or backward, one person must hold the afflicted person&#39;s body, while another pulls the leg, using all their strength to push it back into place. If the dislocation is severe, a soft cotton rope can be used to bind and hang the leg upside down, and the bones can be adjusted from above. Once repositioned, a bone-setting ointment or pain-relieving ointment should be applied and secured.</p>
<p>For injuries to the spine, if the vertebrae are misaligned, do not attempt to adjust them by hand. Instead, a soft rope should be used to suspend the feet and allow the body to hang straight down, allowing the bones to realign naturally. If the bones have not returned to position, do not use force to realign them. Once the bones are straight, apply either bone-setting ointment, pain-relieving ointment, or flesh-repairing ointment. Place a piece of mulberry bark on the medicine, followed by two or three pieces of cedar bark on top, and wrap them with a soft material to ensure they remain straight, applying the medicine properly.</p>
<p>For smashed bones in the hands or feet, anesthetics should be administered, or an incision should be made with a knife. In severe cases, bone edges may be cut with scissors to prevent the flesh from rupturing. In cases of fractures, the broken pieces should be removed to avoid the complications of pus and bleeding.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>Then take large pieces of mulberry bark to apply meat-grafting ointment or pain-relief ointment on top of it, pressing it against the flesh and bones, ensuring there are no mistakes. Wash it every three days, and do not let it become foul. Use medicine to dress it. Furthermore, do not easily rely on the presence of medicine to cut, clip, or manipulate; careful examination is necessary, and actions should be taken only when required, with particular attention to detail. If there are injuries on the head, if it is broken, or if there are knife wounds or crushed bones, apply medicine and bind the area. During the binding process, it is essential to do so in a windless, secluded space, preventing drafts from reaching the wound, as this may lead to tetanus. Remember this well!</p>
<p>For injuries to the scrotum or perineum: if the scrotum has been pulled off, apply egg yolk and spread thinly with fur from a golden-haired dog, followed by sealing with a medicinal powder, and lastly apply blood-stopping ointment. Externally, take decoction of middle leaf golden key and purple golden skin, while washing with water decocted with perilla leaves.</p>
<p>If there is a blue-black or purple swelling in the scrotum area, apply meat-grafting ointment, or use pain-relief ointment mixed with small amounts of red peony, herb twain, ginger, and cinnamon pounded together, combining this with crushed leek leaves for the application. If leek leaves are not available, scallion leaves may also suffice. Additionally, take medicine to promote urination.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>For women with leg bones protruding near the vagina, do not step in. Use a stool covered with cotton cloth, allowing the patient to lie on top. The physician should gently manipulate the patient’s leg with their hands, pressing down while holding the healthy leg, causing the leg bone to return. Then, apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment for treatment.</p>
<p>For injuries near the legs and groin, do not use medicinal herbs to promote blood flow; instead, apply ointments to avoid bleeding.</p>
<p>For tendon and bone injuries: If tendons are severed or bones are fractured, first use your hands to locate the injury, aligning the tendons and bones properly. Apply bone-setting ointment, and secure it with appropriate binds. The primary binding should be made from cedar bark, larger than a finger, placed over the flesh with medicine applied. A secondary binding can be used, made from bamboo skin, also around the size of a finger, loosely applied.</p>
<p>For fractures that are shattered or not completely broken, but with damaged skin and flesh, first use a muscle-replenishing powder to fill the wound, followed by blood-stopping ointment. If there is a bone fracture, use bone-setting ointment followed by binding. If the skin is broken and the bone is fractured, use muscle-replenishing ointment for treatment.</p>
<p>For cases of bone fracture with skin rupture, do not use alcohol to prepare medicine.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>If there is damage with broken skin and flesh, you may mix children&#39;s urine into the wound medicine for internal use. If the bone is fractured but the skin is intact, use wine to decoct the medicinal herbs for treatment. For injuries without broken bones or flesh, use swelling ointment or pain-relief ointment.</p>
<p>For cases where the skin is broken and the bone protrudes unevenly, pinch the skin around the area for about three points, and make a small incision with a sharp knife to push the bone back in. There is no need to cut the flesh, as it will rupture on its own, allowing the bone to be repositioned. After the bone is in place, apply a meat-repairing ointment around the wound and fill the wound opening with muscle-repairing powder. If the skin and flesh are intact, apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relief ointment.</p>
<p>If there is a break, there will certainly be bleeding; exert pressure and act swiftly. For instances where shards of bone are within the flesh, simply use pain-relief ointment and bone-setting ointment for application and secure it with binding. In severe cases, the flesh will eventually rupture, and the fractured bone will emerge on its own; thereafter, apply muscle-repairing powder and cover with meat-repairing ointment.</p>
<p>For fragmented bones, assess how aligned the area is. Generally, if a bone appears lower, the surrounding bones are uninjured; if it&#39;s higher, those bones will likely have suffered damage. In cases of fractured bones, ensure they are aligned properly, applying ointment and securing with splints to prevent movement, thus allowing the damaged area to stabilize.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>When joints are dislocated, one must gently rotate them repeatedly to avoid excessive strain. For applications, use a board with banana leaves or paper to spread the bone-setting paste or pain-relieving ointment on top, and then apply it to the injury. If there are broken bones under the skin, later the flesh will decay; one should first apply a muscle-repair powder, and then the flesh-repair ointment to help the fragments emerge. If the skin and flesh are torn, first use a sealing medicine to fill the wound and sew it with thread, then apply flesh-repair ointment and blood-stopping ointment externally.</p>
<p>For fractures where the bone is broken but the skin remains intact, simply use bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment to bind and support the area. For joints in the hands and feet or areas that require movement, it is best to use light silk wraps to allow for periodic movement, avoiding tight bindings. If a finger bone is fractured, only use ramie to tie it. For leg injuries, use ramie rope. In winter, bind with warmth; in summer, with coolness; and in other months, with moderate warmth.</p>
<p>When needing to pull or stretch, one should use soft, thin materials and gently extend. Close to the injury site, do not go too far out along the bone, but continue to pull and extend. Assess the orientation of each bone, as there are specific angles for pulling and extending.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>All techniques for compression and restraint must be swift and proper, with the skin and flesh held evenly. When pulling, one must also assess the ease or difficulty; sometimes three or four people are needed, and care should not be taken lightly. </p>
<p>For broken tendons, use maple incense to chop the gold grass for juice, then apply it for dressing. </p>
<p>For binding and medicating: Generally, for binding, it should last three days in spring, two in summer, three in autumn, and four in winter. The binding area should be soaked with medicinal water, washing off the old medicine carefully without disturbing the injured area. After washing, continue to use the previous ointment for binding. If binding is necessary, use soft-immersed cedar wood stripped of its coarse bark and bamboo strips that are trimmed of yellow, making pieces about the size of a finger. Use cedar bark as the primary clamp and bamboo strips as the secondary clamp, loosely arranging them around the area. Bind it three times with small ropes, adjusting the height and distance to ensure the circulation of qi and blood in the injured area, allowing for both tightness and looseness, as stated before. Change the dressing every two or three days, aiming for one month of binding. Then apply good restorative ointment, also with cedar bark holding the area firm. For older bones, do not clamp them. Place cedar bark directly on the flesh, medicine on top of the cedar bark, paper over the medicine, and bind it with bamboo strips over the paper.</p>
<p>For swelling caused by blood, wash with hot medicinal water and then apply herbal poultices.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>If the remedy cannot be applied immediately, it is most convenient to use a balm with protective adhesive. When using a compress, the medicine must be spread evenly on paper, with both ends thin, ensuring the application is not too thick to avoid pressing on the flesh. It should be smooth and flat to prevent unevenness. If the edges are uneven, there will be gaps above that do not touch the flesh, which can lead to blisters; remember this! </p>
<p>For applying medicine that binds bones and alleviates pain, if the pain persists, add some of the following ingredients: frankincense, myrrh, balsam, angelica, cinnamon, rhizoma arisaema, and ligusticum. Adjust the quantities as needed for the application. This will warm the flesh and relieve pain. For injuries caused by knives or axes, omit cinnamon, rhizoma arisaema, and ligusticum.</p>
<p>When changing the medicine, do not replace it directly. Instead, dampen a cloth and use it to moisten the compress. Remove and clean the old medicine piece by piece without delay to avoid blistering. Always prepare the new medicine beforehand for immediate application. This is a major principle; neglect can lead to severe complications, so remember this! </p>
<p>For severe injuries that are initially numb and painless, one should stretch and adjust the affected area, or carefully cut the skin with a knife. Pain may not appear until two to three days later, so it is essential to balance qi and blood first. </p>
<p>If struck by a rod causing pain and swelling without breaking the skin, first use a pricking needle to draw blood.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>If the injury does not require bleeding, simply scatter money on the ground, along with mountain mint, raw Rehmannia, ground mint, boar’s (female) vine leaves, Wangchuan leaves, and blood-stanching herbs to make a poultice. If it develops into a sore, use black, white, red plasters, Taiyi ointment, and beef tallow ointment for application. For cuts from blades or axes, assess the severity and use appropriate medicine. For minor injuries, simply use muscle-replenishing powder; for more serious injuries, apply sealing medicine and bind tightly. In cases of severe injury, use blood-stopping ointment for application.</p>
<p>For injuries caused by falling trees or from a height, these kinds of injuries disturb the limbs and organs, likely resulting in stagnant blood in the body, leading to nausea. First, use heart-clearing medicine and blood-moving herbs, followed by laxatives for the large and small intestine, taking them sequentially. Add the urine of a young boy into the medicine for immediate effect. It is critical that the intestines remain clear to prevent blockages, as they can cause significant harm. Use heart-clearing medicine combined with the previously mentioned laxatives, as they will facilitate smooth bowel movements without discomfort or stagnant blood. Finally, take pain relief medicine.</p>
<p>For injuries such as falls, cuts, or impacts, in severe cases, start with heart-clearing medicine, followed by three doses of the clear urinary medicine.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>For treatments to stop bleeding, if the injured person has not formed a clot and blood flows from the wound, or if it has clotted internally, medicine applied to the large intestine will cause diarrhea; if the person has been hit, shaken, or crushed by wood and bad blood has not accumulated, use medicine to disperse it from the limbs. If it returns to internal organs or ascends, it will be expelled through the mouth; if it returns to the middle, it will be discharged by the large intestine, and this should be used for urgent care. Then, take pain relief medicine, adjusting the dosage from twenty-five ingredients.</p>
<p>All medicines should be taken with herbal decoctions, according to the prescribed methods, first using a formula for clearing the heart, followed by a cup of children&#39;s urine taken together. For pain relief in serious injuries, use ginger soup or light bamboo shoot soup to mix with the twenty-five herbs; mint soup is also acceptable.</p>
<p>In any case of injury, whether from cuts or damage to internal organs, there is concern about the potential for anxiety and bleeding. In cases of broken bones, take ginger wine together with bone-setting medicine for application. If bones are shattered from severe blows or being crushed by heavy objects, first use the herbal decoction method, and also take it with wine.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>If light traumatic injuries occur, use ginger soup to adjust twenty-five kinds of medicines for immediate effect. For injuries such as contusions, fractures, or dislocations, it is advisable to use He Shou Wu powder. If the person has fever and a full body, use the dispersing wind and eliminating pathogen powder. If they feel cold and are weak, use the five accumulation intermingled powder, followed by the powders of yellow, white, red, and black, as well as restorative and blood-activating pills for treatment.</p>
<p>For fractures and dislocations, it is not appropriate to use herbs that expel blood stagnation or those that promote bowel movements; instead, one should use methods to dispel wind, smooth the Qi, harmonize the blood, relieve pain, and restore damage. </p>
<p>For injuries from falling, hitting, or dropping from a height, where there is blood stasis attacking the heart and the person cannot speak, use Du Sheng powder and then regulate with the Recovery and Blood-Activating soup. </p>
<p>For injuries resulting in bruised skin with a purple-black coloration, first use blood-breaking medicine, then Du Sheng powder, and subsequently the Clear Upper Blood Stasis and Dissolve Lower Blood Breaking soups. </p>
<p>For traumatic injuries with vomiting of bloody juices, start with Du Sheng powder, followed by Bai He powder, and then the Four Substances soup with raw materials, adding cow&#39;s milk root as needed for treatment.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>For injuries caused by blows from knives or axes, resulting in broken skin and flesh with significant bleeding, and if there is dizziness, first use chuan danggui and chuan xiong boiled in water to take, then add white peony root, cooked rehmannia root, fringed gentian, fangfeng, schizonepeta, qianghuo, duhuo, and nanxing, boiled in water. Mix it with children&#39;s urine for ingestion, and do not use alcohol. If the bleeding is minor and there is internal bruising, use half the dose of shengliao siwu decoction and half of dushengsan, boiled in water for ingestion. If the skin and flesh are intact, take the upper part mixed with alcohol.</p>
<p>For injuries from knives or axes causing tetanus, where the pain is unbearable, the jaw is tightly clenched, and there is an arched back, use shengnanxing and fangfeng ground into a powder, mixed with rice wash to apply to the affected area. Then take equal parts of hot wine and children&#39;s urine, and take three doses, which will restore consciousness; follow up with dispersing wind and eliminating toxicity powder for treatment.</p>
<p>For injuries from knives or axes that have broken the skin of the scrotum, first take dushengsan and then pain relief medicine. If there is old blood inside, use blood-breaking medicine.</p>
<p>For knife or axe injuries that penetrate the abdominal skin and intestines, first use heart-clearing medicine mixed with children&#39;s urine for ingestion, and use dushengsan, followed by pain relief medicine.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>If blood loss is excessive, first use angelica and chuanxiong boiled in water and taken. Then add white peony, cooked rehmannia, qianhuo, duhuo, fangfeng, jingjiao, white atractylodes, and herbs for broken bones boiled together, adjusting with frankincense and myrrh powder to take. </p>
<p>In all injury and damage remedies, frankincense and myrrh cannot be absent, as these herbs are especially effective in dispelling stagnant blood and alleviating pain. For cuts or injuries from falling or dislocations, initially do not use natural copper, but after a while, it can be used. For bone fractures, it is advisable to use it immediately. If there is no fracture or splintering, it should not be used. All remedies for damage should focus on their benefits. When using natural copper, it must be calcined with fire before taking. However, freshly heated copper contains fire toxins that mix with metal toxins and carry fragrant heat that, despite having the ability to aid bone healing, can be drier and harsher than blades, so caution is advised!</p>
<p>For falls that result in internal bruising, there will be abdominal distension and pain, or fullness in the chest and sides; it is advisable to use blood-breaking drugs and heart-cleansing medicines to facilitate recovery naturally. If the pain does not stop, use the Duxing powder for efficacy. If still not relieved, use pain-relief medicines, which work remarkably well.</p>
<p>For injuries from metal blades due to high falls, causing skin and flesh damage with excessive bleeding, it is advisable to prioritize pain relief and nourishment, suggesting angelica blood-nourishing soup. If the skin and flesh are not damaged, it is necessary to treat the accumulation of stagnant blood, first with Duxing powder, followed by blood-breaking medicines, adjusted according to the symptoms. If the pain persists, use pain-relieving medicines for adjustment.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>If there is chest pain, use happy grass, snow lily, and su wood boiled in wine, mixed with children&#39;s urine and taken orally for immediate effect. Another method: simply boil su wood in wine, mix it with children&#39;s urine, and take it. </p>
<p>For injuries from knives or axes, or from falling from heights that cause severe cuts and trauma where the skin and flesh are damaged, apply sealing ointment to the central wound and use hemostatic ointment around the edges to prevent fresh blood from flowing and causing further issues; this is a secret remedy. </p>
<p>For injuries, the key is to replenish qi and blood, which common practitioners do not understand; they only seek immediate results and often use natural copper, fearing chronic ailments may develop. For initial injuries, use su wood to invigorate blood circulation, honeysuckle to clear heat, and white atractylodes to regulate the middle, taken with boiled children&#39;s urine. For lower injuries, it may help to expel stagnant blood, but one must first replenish and support the body. For upper injuries, it is advisable to drink chive juice or consume it with porridge. Never drink cold water, as cold causes blood to coagulate; even a small amount of cold blood entering the heart can be fatal. </p>
<p>For elderly individuals who fall from a horse and have back pain without the ability to turn, initially use su wood, ginseng, astragalus, chuanxiong, angelica, dried tangerine peel, and licorice boiled together. Then adjust the previous medicine with powdered red, black, yellow, and white herbs, replenishing and invigorating blood.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>For any injuries causing pain from blows or impacts, this indicates stagnation of blood, and one should use blood-breaking medicine to address it. If the pain is unbearable, it is due to blood being injured; hence, a heart-clearing medicine is advisable. If the pain persists, using the &quot;Duxing San&quot; will be very effective.</p>
<p>For injuries from cutting or striking with axes or other implements, where blood gushes like a spring, it indicates injury to the meridians. One should use sealing medicines while pressing firmly with the hand; after a short while, the bleeding will stop. Additionally, a hemostatic powder may also be applied. If there is swelling and pain, one can pound scallions, fry them warm, and bind them to the area.</p>
<p>For any loss causing difficulty in urination or defecation, one should not hastily take remedies for loss, as these medicines are heat-inducing and should be taken with wine; otherwise, it will worsen constipation. Assess whether the patient is in a state of deficiency or excess: in cases of excess, use blood-breaking medications combined with &quot;Mucuna&quot; for better flow; if still obstructed, add &quot;Ming Xiao.&quot; In deficiency cases, use &quot;Si Wu Tang&quot; with the addition of &quot;Zhi Ke,&quot; &quot;Ma Ren,&quot; or &quot;Tao Ren&quot; for gentle bowel movement. For those who are deficient and cannot have a purgative, use &quot;Si Wu Tang&quot; with &quot;Chuan Shan Jia.&quot;</p>
<p>When taking medicines for loss, one must avoid cold foods. Fish and beef are extremely cold and should be avoided altogether. If one eats beef, the pain will not subside. Also, avoid eating pork from sick pigs or sows; remember this well!</p>
<p>For any loss, one may take herbal medicines, but they must come from a large bone and not a human mortuary. When combining sovereign and ministerial medicines, they should be prepared with warming and blood-qi-tonifying herbs together.</p>
<p>All medicines for loss must be taken hot, as they are capable of generating blood and energy to reconnect bones. Furthermore, one should avoid using fire to roast them.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>If external applications are ineffective, internal medicine will also not be effective. When using herbal poultices, it is essential to pick fresh herbs on-site for efficacy. If traveling far and unable to obtain them fresh, they can be ground into powder instead. However, powdered herbs are inferior to fresh ones. If herbal remedies are unavailable, you can use the monarch and minister herbs together in a binding preparation. </p>
<p>For any decoction containing alcohol, it should not matter whether it is red or white, but gray wine must be avoided. Moreover, in cases of severe injury, alcohol should not be administered carelessly, as it may exacerbate swelling and cause abdominal distension; this must be firmly noted! If the condition stabilizes somewhat, then alcohol can be prepared with water or infused in broth.</p>
<p>For injuries affecting the sides, chest, abdomen, or ribs, it is necessary to use herbs that promote circulation, alleviate blood stasis, and clear the heart. Additionally, one must consider the patient&#39;s condition—whether they are weak or strong. For those who are weak, the herbs used for circulation and nourishment should be administered gently, using poultices first and circulation-inducing herbs afterward.</p>
<p>If circulation-promoting herbs do not induce flow, then use herbs that regulate qi afterward. If the abdomen shows no signs of swelling, this indicates that blood is not the issue, but rather qi is blocked. If blood is indeed present in the abdomen, one must quickly address it, integrating qi-regulating herbs as well, ensuring that the chest and abdomen do not become painfully tight. After normalizing the qi, one can then use blood-reducing herbs.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>When a common person drunkenly falls and hits the ground, experiencing pain in the shoulders and back, unable to bend or stretch, and conventional treatments fail, taking black bean wine for several days will help. The bean can dispel qi, indicating that the damage is slight. </p>
<p>For small children who fall and hit a corner of a table, simply using ground radish seeds brewed and consumed will aid recovery, as it also helps with qi. </p>
<p>Generally, when applying treatments, avoid using medicinal washes on the head, as this might lead to tetanus; for other areas, you may use cooked oil mixed with medicinal washes to fend off wind and alleviate pain. When treating, start by grinding caowu (a type of herb) with hot wine and take one or two cups before proceeding. If the qi is completely exhausted, use suhexiang pills to revitalize; before revitalizing, brew and consume black beans, fangfeng (siler), licorice, and huanglian (coptis) in cool water, or use coix seeds blended in water. Avoid using salt to resolve issues. If there’s vomiting, add fresh ginger juice.</p>
<p>The above methods are prescriptions specialized for specific cases, noting that every individual has variations in their condition and treatments should not be generalized. For instance, if treating someone with completely exhausted qi, giving them concentrated caowu wine while their qi is depleted, followed by suhexiang pills, and then a cool remedy, could result in severe harm for someone with weak qi. One must follow the methods of the Xue family, which are grounded in internal replenishment, and I recommend reviewing the sections on diagnosis and treatment later in this text; learners should proceed with caution!</p>
<p>Ten conditions that do not respond to treatment include injuries from falls or being struck that affect the lungs; even if death does not occur immediately, survival is extremely difficult. Also, injuries beneath the left ribs that penetrate deeply within.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>Injuries that cause a half rupture of the intestines can be treated, but those that cause a complete rupture cannot be cured. </p>
<p>For injuries to the lower abdomen, if the symptoms are numerous, and the pulse feels weak and heavy, treatment is not necessary. </p>
<p>In elderly patients, if there is a fracture in the left thigh, or if there is damage to the internal organs due to impact, or if blood has been completely lost, medication is also unnecessary. </p>
<p>Liu Zonghou stated: Injuries from being struck by a metallic edge arise not from qi movement but from external causes. When affected by tangible external objects, it is the blood, flesh, tendons, and bones that suffer, differing from conditions caused by the six excesses and seven emotions, which relate to disturbances in qi and blood. Thus, for injuries, the focus is solely on blood. It is essential to distinguish between cases of blood stasis and excessive blood loss. </p>
<p>In cases of impact or falls, if the skin is not broken but there is internal damage, it will certainly involve blood stasis. If a metallic edge injures the skin leading to blood loss, the two conditions should not be treated in the same manner. For those with blood stasis, treatment should focus on removing it, while for those who have lost blood, treatment should combine replenishment with other measures.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Moreover, upon examining the injuries, there are differences in severity, depth, and the amount of vital energy and blood circulating in the meridians. It is essential to first expel the stagnant blood, unblock the meridians, harmonize the blood, and alleviate pain. Then, one can adjust the vital energy, nourish the blood, and replenish the stomach energy; all of these will be effective.</p>
<p>Recently, I observed that soldiers in the besieged city who were injured, regardless of whether the severity was in the head, face, hands, feet, chest, or back, were universally treated with powerful laxatives such as rhubarb. When rhubarb became scarce, some even resorted to using castor beans, believing it would help dispel toxins immediately; however, this often led to serious harm later. Even slight injuries to fingers were treated similarly with laxatives. </p>
<p>Little did they know that rhubarb is only suitable for those with stagnant blood; for those who have lost too much blood and whose vital energy and stomach energy are weak, it should not be taken. Castor beans are very heated and toxic; they can only break down hardened masses and eliminate accumulation, making them particularly inappropriate for these ailments. Consequently, after administering laxatives, if the pulse becomes increasingly hard and strong, the physician, failing to recognize this change, mistakenly believes that stagnant blood has not been fully expelled and continues to treat it further, which could lead to the unfortunate loss of life. Can one be too cautious in this regard?<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Tetanus</p>
<p>The wind is the beginning of all diseases. When the body is clear and pure, the pores close off; even with a strong and toxic wind, it cannot harm. If the wounds are unhealed, the defense and nourishment are weak, the muscles do not regenerate, and the wounds do not close, then the wind evil enters, causing the condition known as tetanus. There are also cases of internal sores with heat and stagnation, often covered with white scabs, where the wound openings are blocked, making it difficult for the qi to circulate. Thus, when the heat is intense and leads to wind, one must first observe the wound: if it is flat and without discharge, it indicates wind; if yellow fluid comes out from the edges, it indicates dampness; and if there are signs of convulsions, urgent treatment is required. </p>
<p>Dong Yuan says: Tetanus connects the exterior and interior, differentiating between yin and yang, and should be treated in a manner similar to typhoid fever. People understand the need for external treatment but do not recognize the necessity for internal attack and harmonization. If the pulse is floating and weak, it&#39;s linked to the Taiyang (greater yang) stage, so sweating is appropriate. If the pulse is long and strong, it pertains to the Yangming (bright yang) stage, hence purging is advised. If the pulse is floating and thin, it relates to the Shaoyang (lesser yang) stage, which is half in the exterior and half in the interior, requiring harmonization. Understanding these three methods will ensure treatment is aligned with the disease. There has not been a case where one has applied the three yang treatments and failed to address the illness. It is merely stated that these methods are for the three yang and does not involve the three yin, as the wind evil is found in the three yang channels, making early treatment according to the methods beneficial for recovery.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>If one waits to transmit into the three yin, the symptoms are already critical. There may be abdominal fullness with spontaneous bowel movements, dry mouth and throat, a curled and shriveled tongue, all showing no signs of vitality; therefore, such cases are set aside and not discussed. </p>
<p>For exterior resolution, use Qianghuo Fangfeng Decoction, Fangfeng Decoction, Jiuwèi Qianghuo Decoction, and Wugong Powder; for internal resolution afterwards, use Baizhu Fangfeng Decoction. For purging the interior, use Daqinghuang Decoction, Hongbiaowan, and Zuolong Pill; then follow with Xiao Qianghuo Decoction. For harmonizing and resolving, use Qianghuo Decoction, Diyi Fangfeng Powder, and Xiao Chaihu Decoction.</p>
<p>With prolonged illness, qi and blood become gradually deficient, and evil qi enters the stomach; it is advisable to use Siwu Decoction with the addition of Fangfeng, Gaoben, and Baizhi in equal portions, grinding Xixin to half as coarse powder. Each dose is five qian, boiled in water and taken warm. If there is excessive wind medicine and spontaneous sweating, use Baizhu Huangqi Decoction. If there is excessive sweating that does not stop, with muscle spasms, use Baizhu Shengma Decoction. If there are persistent spasms, use Juanjie Decoction. </p>
<p>For spasms in the back, use Qianghuo, Duhuo, Fangfeng, and Licorice; for spasms in the front, use Shengma, Baizhi, Duhuo, Fangfeng, and Licorice. For spasms on both sides, use Chaihu, Fangfeng, and Licorice; if on the right side, add Talcum. </p>
<p>For persistent trembling and dropping of hands and feet, use Zhushajiaosan.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>There are four forms of incurable signs: First, the head and face appear dark blue or black; second, beads of sweat do not flow from the forehead; third, the eyes are small and bulging; fourth, sweat oozes from the body like oil but the pain is not in the wound area—this indicates injury to the meridians and also signifies death.</p>
<p>For external treatment: </p>
<p>When sores swell and form white scabs, along with chills and fever, urgently apply Yuzhen powder. Alternatively, peel and finely chew apricots, mix them with realgar and fine white flour as a poultice. [One method uses equal parts of apricot kernels and flour mixed with fresh spring water to create a paste for application.] Gradually reduce the swelling. If the waist and spine are arching, limbs are stiff, and jaws are locked tight, take one mouse (the head and tail), burn it to ash, grind finely, and mix with lard from a pig raised in the twelfth lunar month for application. If the jaw is tightly clenched and cannot open, dry one centipede, grind it into a fine powder, and apply it to the gums to elicit saliva and relieve the condition. In the case of rabies from a dog bite, regardless of the quantity of ginseng, burn it over mulberry wood until the smoke is exhausted, grind it into powder, apply it to the wound, and use fish glue to boil, melt, and seal it.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Surgical Authenticity by Chen Shigong of the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falls and Impacts</strong></p>
<p>Falls can be classified into those that have or have not broken the skin, and there are differences between losing blood and suffering from bruising. For instance, if one falls from a height without breaking the skin, there will be bruised blood accumulating within the organs, causing the person to feel dazed and unresponsive, resulting in difficulty with urination. One should use Da Cheng Decoction to promote urination, and the person will regain consciousness. If they remain unresponsive, the Guo Shen Decoction can save them. For ordinary falls, directly using the Revitalizing Blood Decoction is sufficient. If there are injuries to bones and joints, with torn tendons and continuous blood flow, the Sheng San can stop the bleeding. Following that, one should apply the Huai Rui Shi powder externally. For severe cases such as breaks in bones and major tissue damage, specialized methods for setting bones and binding will be needed; details for these procedures are not yet specified.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds from Sharp Instruments</strong></p>
<p>Wounds from sharp instruments, or &quot;golden wounds,&quot; occur when cut by a blade. Some may involve deeper injuries that affect muscles and sinews. If the skin is merely broken, apply Tao Hua Powder to stop the bleeding. If the tendons are severed, mix in Sheng Jin Dao Powder. If bleeding resumes after stopping, it is imperative to apply Yu Hong Ointment directly to the wound, as the ointment promotes healing. If there is a fracture of muscles or bones, the person&#39;s complexion will surely turn yellow; they must avoid wind and cold externally, and avoid cold foods internally to prevent complications. For those who have lost an excessive amount of blood, the Guo Shen Decoction and Ba Zhen Decoction are essential for recovery; there are no alternatives for these cases.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Zhang Chuang (Wound from a Cane)</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Chuang refers to the affliction of good flesh being hurt, distinguished by whether it is already burst or not, akin to the difference between punishment and extreme torment. For already burst muscle, apply a cooling and pain-relieving ointment after the cane strike, and the swelling will dissipate. If not burst, and there is internal bruising, use a needle to release the congealed blood internally, followed by taking Da Cheng Decoction, which will facilitate recovery. If the wounded area has rotting and has already begun to pain, apply jade red ointment to it, which will naturally decompose and regenerate, leading to healing. When enduring a situation with humiliation or extreme suffering, it is advisable to preemptively take Iron Cloth Shirt Pill to safeguard one’s body and life.</p>
<p><strong>Bite Wounds</strong></p>
<p>Human bites are a concern, as they injure good flesh. However, teeth belong to the Yangming stomach and are distinct, containing excess organs, and tend to be hot and fiery when produced in the mouth. Ingesting food through biting thoroughly masticated and swallowing, as well as the toxicity from cooked food, all contribute to the injury, resulting in swelling, extraordinary pain, foul pus, and decay that pierces the heart, which indicates the toxicity from the teeth. After a bite, within a day, wash the wound with warm urine to cleanse the yellow bruising from the teeth, then apply to the bite hole a toad fat paste. Cover with a bandage, and as the pus begins to emerge, healing will gradually occur. If this method is not followed and swelling and severe pain arise, wash again with child urine to cleanse it. Use coarse paper dipped in sesame oil, ignite it to create smoke, and let it waft over the swollen painful area until it subsides, to alleviate the tooth toxicity. Also, insert a strip of toad fat into the wound, cover it, and monitor as the swelling decreases, while regularly applying jade red ointment to aid in the healing of the flesh and mouth. If there are additional complications, treat according to those specific symptoms.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Tetanus</strong></p>
<p>Tetanus arises from wounds in the flesh, which are subsequently invaded by external wind that gradually penetrates the meridians and moves inward. The external symptoms include alternating cold and heat, clenched jaws, arched back, and foaming at the mouth; if it affects the yin, the body feels cool with spontaneous sweating, and the wound appears flat and sunken as before, as the poison has internalized. </p>
<p>One should use the Universal Elixir to induce sweating and expel the wind pathogen; then apply the Jade True Powder to the affected area, achieving effectiveness once pus is produced. If after sweating the initial symptoms do not recede, the wound remains flat, and there are periods of consciousness and unconsciousness, with intermittent spasms and inability to open the mouth or produce sound, it ultimately leads to death. </p>

<p>It treats sores and poison from injuries caused by sticks, regardless of whether they have already burst or not. If the flesh is injured but not rotten, using this remedy will lead to self-healing. If the flesh is dead and you use it, it will cause the necrotic flesh to decay, allowing new flesh to grow easily. When the flesh gradually turns white, the poison is nearly exhausted, and new tissue forms rapidly. For injuries from sticks where the outer skin is intact but the inner flesh is rotting, the outer skin may dry out and harden due to internal heat, causing painful connections to healthy flesh, hence the common term &quot;boil scab skin.&quot; Pus accumulates with no way to drain, leading to internal swelling and pain, and sometimes it becomes so deep that surgical intervention is needed before it ruptures, creating an opening that is hard to close.</p>
<p>Weak individuals often develop tetanus from such injuries, frequently resulting in severe consequences. If there is stagnant blood within the stick wound, use a sharp magnetic piece to draw out the bad blood at the affected area, and apply this ointment. The boil scab will form naturally, dead flesh will decay, pus will exit, and what bursts will be superficial, allowing new flesh to grow without forming scabs and avoiding the pain of skin peeling, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. </p>

<li>Yellow wax: 2 qians </li>
<li>Borneol: 1 fen </li>
<li>Musk: 3 fens </li>
<li>Asafoetida chunks: 5 fens</li>
</ul>
<p>After combining the four ingredients, add them to the pot just before removing it from the heat. Stir thoroughly, and then remove the asafoetida residue. </p>
<p>Now, take the fine powder and divide it into five portions. Gradually add four portions to the pot as described. Keep one portion to adjust the thickness of the medicine as needed. If the four portions have been added and the mixture is still thin, gradually add this remaining portion. If the consistency is just right, set this one portion aside to mix into the plaster when applying it to the affected area, which is particularly effective. </p>

<p>For preservation, use oil paper and bamboo leaves to tightly seal the bottle opening to prevent gas leakage.

<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When a person falls or suffers a setback, bad blood remains inside, causing abdominal fullness and swelling, making it difficult to move forward or backward. First, administer beneficial medicine. This affects the Jueyin meridian above and the Shaoyin collateral below. Puncture below the inner ankle of the foot, causing blood to flow from the vessels in front of the bone, and puncture the dorsal artery of the foot. If this does not help, puncture each of the three points on the back of the hand until blood is seen. Puncture the left side for issues on the right, and vice versa. For those who are easily saddened, startled, or unhappy, puncture as per the right side.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When there is a fall or setback, bad blood remains inside. If there is great anger, the qi rises without descending, accumulating below the ribs and thus harming the liver. Additionally, a stroke or being hit can occur; for instance, if one is drunk and sweats in the wind, it harms the spleen. Furthermore, headache cannot be treated by meridian points. If struck and there is internal bad blood, and if the pain has not subsided, one can puncture laterally, but not distantly. If the body is injured and there is excessive bleeding due to stroke or cold, if there is a fall, the limbs become weak and slack, termed &#39;body slack.&#39; Treat the area below the navel, three inches below the navel, which corresponds to the Yangming and Taiyin, and this is the Guanyuan point.</p>

<p>The &quot;History of the Yuan&quot; states: Bu Zhier, under the command of Yuan Taizu, was shot multiple times during a campaign against the Hui people, and his body was filled with blood. Taizu ordered a cow to be taken, its abdomen opened, and the wounded individual placed inside to soak in warm blood. After a while, he recovered.</p>
<p>Li Ting, under Bie Yan, was wounded in the left ribs by cannonfire and had an arrow penetrate his chest, nearly resulting in death. Bie Yan ordered the abdomen of a water buffalo to be opened, and he was placed inside. After a long time, he recovered.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>The &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; states: During the Xuanhe era, there was a royal physician in a certain kingdom who abruptly received a summons from the emperor to attend to a Buddhist monk. Upon examination, the physician found that the monk had already succumbed to death. When questioned about the cause of death, the attendants were at a loss and terrified. After a long while, two or three elderly attendants arrived, weeping as they approached the sedan chair, and only then did they reveal the truth: he had fallen while chasing after a butterfly, descending from the white sky, which resulted in his death. The physician explained that the injuries were from a fall and belonged to the category of external injuries. He wanted to clarify further but feared uncertainty in the future. Upon another inspection, he noticed a faint breath. Suddenly, he remembered that he had a scented pill in his medicine pouch. He hurriedly took half a tael and heated it over a fire, removing the brain and musk, then ground it with half a liter of wine to administer. By the third watch of the night, the monk finally moaned in agony, and by the fifth watch, he expelled a large quantity of dark blood. After a few days of treatment, he finally recovered.</p>
<p>Cui Jishi was recently serving as a judge with Li Baozhen in Zelu. Li Xiang had been striking a ball with a cue when a general inadvertently struck him with his staff, resulting in an injury to Li&#39;s thumb, which split his nail. In a hurry, he requested a golden knife and medicine to wrap around it, and despite the pain, he forced himself to sit up and repeatedly asked for wine, drinking several cups. As he consumed too much, his complexion turned increasingly pale, yet he bore the pain without complaint. One soldier suggested using freshly cut green onions, which were then heated over sugar and ashes, peeled, and split open to extract the juice. This was applied to the injury, and the warming of the onions was repeated several times. After three applications, his complexion turned red, and soon after he mentioned that the pain had subsided. They repeated this process over ten times, using the heated onions and their juice, and eventually finished the meal in laughter and conversation.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>The &quot;Confucian Door to Filial Piety&quot; states: A person from Dai traveled and passed through the old city of Xi. He saw a man beaten with a rod, suffering from painful sores, the poison inside him causing a block in the throat, unable to open his mouth, and unable to take in gruel or medicine. After a month of futile treatments, he resigned himself to death. The man from Dai first used a mixture of Three Holy Powders to expel the greenish bile and blockage in the throat, using about half a large jar. Next, he administered over a hundred pills of a purging medicine to remove the foul, dry filth, which took up another large jar. Then he decocted a few qian of the Tongsheng Powder to be taken hot, followed by a sour, spicy soup with scallions and vinegar to induce sweating. Soon, vomiting and diarrhea occurred, and the man survived. This method can be employed for rescue.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: A man suffered from injuries caused by a fall, experiencing bloating and pressure in both sides, a desire to cough but could not, a metallic taste in the mouth, swelling and pain throughout the body, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a pronounced thirst with a strong pulse, indicating blood depletion and agitation. He was treated with a mixture of children&#39;s urine wine, and while needling the affected area, much dark blood and rotten flesh were drawn out. Suddenly, he experienced fever and agitation with sweating, followed by taking three doses of a single ginseng decoction which slightly mitigated the symptoms. Additional medications to tonify qi and blood and clear liver fire were administered in several doses, allowing for slight improvement in appetite. Later, he continued alternating doses of the single ginseng decoction, leading to the resolution of all symptoms and increased appetite, but he could not sleep well. He used Guizhi Decoction adding gardenia and bamboo shavings in four doses, promoting sound sleep. Due to mental fatigue, he experienced thirst and spontaneous sweating, with a weak, rapid pulse, so he was given two doses of Donggui Decoction to nourish the blood, bringing him stability. He also took a modified version of the Comprehensive Ginseng Decoction, excluding Chuanxiong and adding wheat, five-flavored herbs, peony, earth bone, ma huang root, and fried floating wheat in several doses until sweating ceased, and the necrotic flesh began to ulcerate. After over twenty additional doses, new flesh began to grow.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>A person has a wound from a stick. The injured area is swollen and painful, but the pain doesn&#39;t subside. I said: &quot;The stagnant blood is inside; it should be urgently needled.&quot; However, they did not follow my advice. I used the natural juice of a radish mixed with powdered mountain gardenia to apply to the wound, then covered it with angelica ointment and prescribed blood-activating medicine, which resulted in healing. Years later, whenever the weather was gloomy, they experienced itching and pain, finally realizing the mistake of not being needled.</p>
<p>Another patient had black swelling on the buttock and thigh, but the skin was unbroken. There was heaviness and pain, leading them to believe there was no stagnant blood inside, thinking that only cooling medicine could relieve the pain. On examining their pulse, it was thin and knotty, indicating deep stagnant blood due to their thick flesh. Without needling, it would worsen, risking internal decay and injury to tendons and bones. I needled four inches deep and extracted several liters of black blood, after which the swelling and pain ceased. That day, they experienced fever and chills, thirst, and headaches, due to both Qi and blood deficiency; a restorative tonic was then administered, and they recovered.</p>
<p>Another patient, after being beaten, took herbal preparations including Four Substances, safflower, peach kernel, and rhubarb to disperse stagnant blood, which instead caused abdominal pain. After administering another dose, the pain worsened, yet pressing on the abdomen did not elicit pain. I noted: &quot;This indicates blood deficiency, hence the relief when pressed. They should take warming and nourishing medicines.&quot; Therefore, I prescribed angelica, white atractylodes, ginseng, astragalus, and two doses of honey-fried licorice, resulting in the pain stopping immediately.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>One patient had stagnant blood dissipated, but had little appetite and thoughts, with dead flesh not ulcerating. With the use of medications to promote expulsion, pus began to slightly drain and clear, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi, requiring significant tonification. However, he did not comply. I insisted on using a strong tonifying remedy, and his appetite improved while the dead flesh started to ulcerate. He also experienced little sleep, so I administered Gui Pi Decoction with added gardenia for two doses, allowing him to rest. Due to exertion, he became mentally distressed and thirsty, with a pulse that was floating and rapid, so I gave him two doses of Danggui Buxue Decoction to calm him.</p>
<p>Another patient had endured severe punishment, with outer skin wounds that had ruptured and stagnant blood pouring out. The inner flesh was rotten and swollen, affecting the chest and back and extending to the toes. He was in a state of faintness, not eating. Therefore, I applied hot black sheepskin to the wounded area, and infused him with a mixture of young boy&#39;s urine and thin porridge, further using remedies to clear the liver, invigorate blood, regulate qi, and strengthen the spleen. His spirit slightly revived, and he began to complain of severe pain all over. I then administered a large dose of blood-nourishing and qi-tonifying medicine, resulting in the swelling diminishing and his appetite improving. In the midst of winter, the stagnant blood congealed and could not expel pus, so I employed a strong tonifying remedy to strengthen his yang energy, and when the pus finally matured, it was drained, revealing the bone. I applied Danggui ointment and, after having administered over a hundred doses of previous medicine, his flesh gradually regenerated.</p>
<p>One patient, although the stagnant blood was gone, still had the appearance and qi of normalcy, yet suffered from heat, thirst, pain, and phlegm obstruction in the diaphragm. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added tianhuafen, fritillaria, balloon flower, and gardenia for two doses, yielding slight improvement; I then added raw Rehmannia, Angelica tails, Scutellaria, Chai Hu, gardenia, and flower powder to achieve recovery. In my treatments of over a hundred patients, this was the only one whose post-treatment blood and qi were not deficient. The examiner took note.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>A patient took a medicinal formula meant to move Qi, resulting in chest distension, shortness of breath, little appetite, fatigue, a dark complexion, and clear purulent discharge. This indicates a deficiency of both Qi and blood. First, the prescriptions of Six Gentlemen and Platycodon were used to harmonize the chest. Later, a tonic to replenish the middle and benefit Qi was given, removing asarum and adding poria, pinellia, five-flavor fruit, and wheat. Gradually, the vital energy was restored and the patient recovered. If the initial prescriptions were used instead, they would have harmed the vital energy, leading to dire consequences.</p>
<p>Another patient had stagnant blood in the affected area. It was treated with Four Substances, Bupleurum, and safflower, resulting in immediate relief from pain, though there were symptoms of chills and fever, along with dry mouth and poor appetite. After continuing with Four Substances, white atractylodes, poria, Bupleurum, Scutellaria, and pollen, the chills and fever subsided. Then, Six Gentlemen, ligusticum, angelica, and patchouli were prescribed, which improved the appetite; although the necrotic tissue was discharging, the pus remains clear and watery. Increasing the dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, and poria in over twenty doses led to the dissolution of the necrotic tissue, and the pus became thicker. Under the influence of a laxative taken once, the patient experienced four bouts of diarrhea; the affected area remained dark, but the pulse was not strong or rapid. Thus, ten complete nourishing tonics were administered with increased doses of cinnamon and ophiopogon, leading to the flesh turning red and new flesh gradually forming. It was encouraging that the patient, being young, responded well to treatment; recovery occurred in just over a month. Otherwise, the condition would have been untreatable. </p>
<p>In cases of contusions where there appears to be stagnation of blood, it is essential to remove it, then administer tonics to bolster the vital energy. The reason being that Qi and blood have already been compromised; it is crucial not to use methods that move Qi or promote bleeding again, as this would further damage the spleen and stomach. Consequently, the vital energy would struggle to reach the lower parts, leading to a counterproductive situation. Those who are weak are particularly susceptible to premature demise.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>A patient experienced swelling and pain, applying a cooling medicine intending to dissipate the stagnant blood, but this resulted in both buttocks and legs becoming cold, with the blood stagnating and congealing, causing distension and discomfort in the chest and abdomen. I quickly removed the applied medicine, washed the affected area with warm urine wine, and administered a formula of Six Gentlemen, Areca nut, and Angelica. I also applied Returning Yang ointment, which gradually warmed the buttocks and legs. I then adjusted the previous formula by removing Areca nut and adding Chuanxiong, Huo Xiang, and Cinnamon sticks in four doses. The stagnant blood was resolved, and I proceeded to perform acupuncture. Furthermore, I nourished the spleen and stomach to support the circulation of qi and blood for healing. It is said that when qi and blood are warmed, they flow; when cold, they congeal. Extreme cold generates heat, transforming into pus, which can lead to deep and extensive decay. Once the blood and qi are compromised, the muscle tissue cannot regenerate, making recovery exceedingly difficult.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>A patient presented with abdominal distension, shortness of breath, thirst with chills and fevers, and ulceration of the buttocks and legs, resembling coagulated blood, much like a bag filled with paste. A decoction was prepared with children&#39;s urine combined with four substances, peach kernels, safflower, chihu, Huangqin, wheat shell, and flower powder, and upon taking it, there was a rapid improvement. The application of black sheepskin on the affected area was very beneficial; later, a large amount of pus and blood was drawn out, and the patient was in a faint condition, with slight movement of the lips and mouth, tightly clenched teeth, and dark coloration in the affected area. It was considered to possibly apply tetanus remedies; however, I stated that this was a case of deficiency of both qi and blood leading to transformation of the condition. </p>
<p>I prescribed ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and white atractylodes, along with a decoction of ginseng and human milk, which restored the original qi and healed the various symptoms; then, I continued to administer the Ten Great Supplements Decoction for regulation and stabilization. If there is internal accumulation of pus and blood, acupuncture should be applied. If the patient experiences lockjaw and involuntary urination after an ulceration, resembling tetanus and indicating extreme deficiency of qi and blood, strong tonics must be urgently used. If one has a longstanding phlegm and wind condition, the focus should be on clearing phlegm and reducing fire. If wind is triggered by anger, it is important to clear the liver and reduce fire. If the patient experiences these symptoms due to carelessness in sexual activity, it signifies deficiency of kidney water and excessive heart fire, requiring primary nourishment of yin and tonification of qi and blood. Misdiagnosing or mismanaging this as a wind condition could result in death.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>A patient fell from a horse on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, experiencing abdominal pain. After drinking several cups of alcohol, he felt better the next morning, with blood in his stool, which relieved his discomfort. This was due to the fullness of his vital energy, allowing the effects of the alcohol to facilitate dispersal.</p>
<p>A man injured from a fall experienced abdominal pain and thirst. After eating two pears, his condition worsened, and he became constipated, feeling blood rising. A prescription of Danggui Chiqi Decoction with added peach kernels helped expel the stagnant blood and he recovered. This was a result of insufficient vital energy, causing stagnant blood to congeal from cold. Therefore, it is not advisable for postpartum women or those with festering wounds to consume this.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>Zheng from the Ministry of Personnel had a longstanding issue with phlegm. In early winter, he fell from a horse, took hot and spicy medications to break the blood, and experienced widespread pain, fever, and dry mouth, with a pulse that was strong and slippery. The heat from the medications had aggravated the phlegm and fire, causing his condition. I treated him with Qingzao Decoction, removing ginseng, angelica, and astragalus, and adding baical skullcap, gardenia, pinellia, and coptis. The heat and pain subsided immediately, but the affected area had only slightly improved. I then used Erchen Decoction, Qianghuo, Platycodon, Atractylodes, coptis, processed ginger, raw rehmannia, and angelica, leading to a full recovery.</p>
<p>Yang, the official, had his bone dislocated, and the area remained painful. The medications had no effect, and his liver pulse was large and rapid. I said: &quot;This pain arises from excess liver heat.&quot; I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added gardenia and coptis, which alleviated the pain. Then I used the Four Substances decoction along with gardenia, coptis, and anemarrhena to regulate him back to health.</p>
<p>Liu Wuqing, a young minister, had a minor injury that caused some pain and loss of appetite. I prescribed Six Gentlemen Decoction with double the amount of angelica and astragalus, and his pain gradually stopped. After more than a month, the stagnant blood internalized without breaking, and he considered himself healed. I said: &quot;This is extreme deficiency of yang qi; you need tonifying treatment.&quot; He did not follow my advice. By early spring, he suffered from phlegm and mucus obstruction. He took medications to clear air and transform phlegm, but his condition worsened, with a pulse that was large and faint. I recommended tonics like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, and aconite, but he did not believe it. By early autumn, due to anger, he collapsed in a fit of rage.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>A man fell from a ladder in autumn, with blood pooling in his abdomen. After using medicines like rhubarb, the blood did not descend, and instead, he experienced chest and diaphragm distension with pain, along with shortness of breath. I prescribed a mixture of two qian each of cinnamon and costus root, mixed with hot wine, which brought down the black blood and the previously taken medicine, leading to his recovery. This was due to the cold medicines causing stagnation, hence I used warming and dispersing agents.</p>
<p>Chen Shiyu fell from a horse, resulting in leg pain and nausea. After taking one dose of medicine, he experienced abdominal and chest distension and pain, which alleviated upon pressure, but he remained fatigued and short of breath. I diagnosed it as not due to blood stasis, but rather an injury causing damage to the vital energy and blood, exacerbated by the medicine harming the spleen&#39;s energy. I prescribed tonifying herbs for the spleen and stomach, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>Wu Jishi fell from a horse and injured his hand, losing excessive blood, becoming feverish and agitated, with muscle tremors. There was consideration to use a medicine for trauma. I said: This is due to blood deficiency and fire disturbance. It is best to heavily supplement the blood. Consequently, I administered Shengyu Decoction in two doses, which calmed him and nourished his energy and blood, healing the wounds.</p>
<p>Zhang Jinshi fell from a horse in late autumn, losing too much blood and sweating profusely, becoming agitated; the next day, his sweating subsided, but he became increasingly hot and restless, with clenched jaws and trembling hands. This was a case of yin blood deficiency, with yang fire ascending causing sweat. The cold air repressed the pores, preventing sweat from escaping; the internal heat could not be released, which aggravated his condition. I used Siwu Decoction with additions of Chaihu, Huangqin, and Shanzhizi in four doses to provide some relief, then treated him with Siwu Decoction, ginseng, astragalus, soft chaihu, five-flavor herb, and wheat mallow, resulting in his complete recovery.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>In early winter, a woman suffered from a foot injury leading to blood loss, sweating from the head, internal heat causing thirst, shortness of breath, and agitation, often becoming faint. Her pulse was strong but weak upon pressure. This was due to deficiency of Yin blood below and excessive Yang fire above, hence the faintness and sweating from the head. A modified Siwu Decoction combined with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction was used to stop the sweating. After combining Siwu with Chuanxiong, adding Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, and a bit of roasted Gan Cao, all symptoms were resolved. After more than thirty doses, her blood and energy were restored and she recovered.</p>
<p>My friend Wang Ruda suffered a sprain at the Huan Tiao point, causing bruising, swelling, pain, and fever with thirst. I used a needle to remove the bruised blood; knowing that his lower jiao had a history of deficiency fire, I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with added Huanglian, Zhimu, Niuxi, and Gusui Bu. Four doses brought immediate relief. I then used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding a bit of Huanglian, Zhimu, and Wu Wei, and after more than thirty doses, his condition improved.</p>
<p>A young child dislocated an arm bone, resulting in swelling, pain, and fever. After taking medications to relieve Qi, he showed significant improvement but had little appetite. I applied scallion poultices, which immediately alleviated the pain; then, treated with Liu Jun Zi, Huang Qi, Chai Hu, Jie Geng, Xu Duan, and Gusui Bu, which improved his appetite and reduced the swelling and pain. Additionally, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, restoring his Qi and blood and resolving the fever, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>Dai Ge Shi fell off his horse, injuring his leg, which became swollen and painful, and his complexion darkened. He had little appetite and felt fatigued. This was due to a deficiency of vital energy, which could not disperse the stagnant blood.

<p>The governor of the state, Chen Ke Ming, injured his right wrist, which became swollen and painful, but the color of the flesh did not change. After a long course of treatments with various medicines, he still experienced symptoms of chills, fever, and reduced appetite, along with a dry tongue and thirst. Moreover, similar symptoms persisted with swelling not dissipating and the color unchanged, indicating a deficiency in both qi and blood that could not heal. Therefore, support for the spleen and stomach to strengthen the qi and blood was prioritized in treatment. Following this method, within two months, his energy gradually improved; after half a year, all symptoms completely receded, and he returned to his usual state.</p>
<p>Liang Ge Lao&#39;s nephew suffered a leg injury. He applied external medication like Da Huang and took internal medicines to break up blood, which resulted in internal rupture. I used needles to extract over three bowls of foul pus, and he exhibited all signs of deficiency. A strong tonic was administered, and after over two months he regained some ability to walk. However, due to mental strain, his hands became shaky, his eyes opened, and he sweated profusely, leading him to consider using medicines to expel wind. I said: This indicates that his qi and blood are still insufficient. Hence, I urgently warmed and frequently pressed his navel and the Qi Hai point with moxibustion. I decocted four taels of Ren Shen and five qian of Fu Zi for administration. After a while, there was slight movement in the arm; another dose was given, and he could open his eyes and speak, though his breath could not stabilize. I then combined Ren Shen, Qi, Gui, and Zhu, totaling one pound, with five qian of Fu Zi, decocted in water, and he took it gradually. His vital energy gradually recovered, his appetite returned, and he was able to discontinue Fu Zi as the wound healed.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>A girl of seventeen had a slight swelling and pain in her right arm.

I then added a modified Siwu Decoction including five grams each of Xiangfu, Diguo Pi, and Zhizi, and three grams each of Qinchao, Lianhua, and roasted licorice, using over twenty doses, which resolved the swelling. I then removed Huanglian and Zhizi, administering over fifty additional doses, and her vital energy was restored.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Wang Qingzhi suffered from pain in his lower back due to a sprain. Despite using pain relief medications, he did not improve; his qi and blood were increasingly depleting, and his face and ears had darkened. I remarked that the lower back is related to the kidneys. Although he claimed it was a sprain, it was actually a result of weakness in the kidney meridian. Therefore, I prescribed a mixture of Du Zhong, Bu Guo Zi, Wu Wei Zi, Shan Yao, and Xianrong to be taken on an empty stomach. I also prescribed six herbs: Ren Shen, Dang Gui, Bai Zhu, and Shen Qu, each at two qian, to be taken away from meals.

<p>In another case, a person named Cao Ziyong suffered a stroke and accidentally bit off part of his finger while taking medicine. He experienced pain, cold, and fever, and external treatments with Da Huang and other medicines, along with internal administration of heat-clearing and toxin-eliminating remedies, led to no pain and no abscess, but the symptoms worsened. I said: This is due to the cooling medicines obstructing the channels. So, I applied Yulong ointment to disperse the cold and additionally prescribed Liu Junzi decoction to strengthen the spleen and stomach. After a few days, there was slight pain at the affected area, and the swelling gradually diminished, indicating the movement of Yang energy to the area, eventually leading to the discharge of thick pus. Within a few days, half of the finger became necrotic, and I prescribed medicines to assist detoxification and encourage healing.</p>
<p>Another case involved a patient named Wang Tianjue, who experienced significant swelling and inner heat leading to thirst. Both internal and external treatments with cold and toxin-eliminating remedies caused further swelling without an abscess and resulted in chills, poor appetite, and nausea. I said: This condition is due to both Qi and blood deficiency, and the cold medicines have coagulated the channels, harming the stomach&#39;s energy, which leads to the previous symptoms. Therefore, I used Xiangsha Liu Junzi, Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Paojiang, and the external symptoms receded completely. However, the patient felt fatigued with a slight afternoon fever and showed poor appetite, which I treated with the Baizhong Yiqi decoction, adding mudanpi, Wuweizi, and Maimendong, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br><strong>Wounds from Insects and Beasts</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the book &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Whenever encountering any poisonous creatures or stings, one must not develop a revulsion towards them or kill them. If one rashly kills them, later one will surely suffer from the poison of the sting, and treatment will be difficult. Be cautious, be cautious!</p>
<p><strong>Rabies</strong></p>
<p>In late spring and early summer, when dogs frequently go mad, one must admonish the weak and small to carry a stick for protection. If one tries to prevent an attack and fails, it will not exceed the remedy of moxibustion. Among a hundred days, if there is not a single day missed, then one may escape disaster. If, upon first encountering a wound, it seems to heal without pain, and one thinks it has recovered, this is the most terrifying sign. Great calamity will arise, and death will come unexpectedly. Whenever a rabid dog bites someone, it causes that person to become mad as well; their spirit has already become detached, how can one be aware? Just watch closely; if during moxibustion the fire is applied for one degree, and the heart feels distinctly awake and clear, then one realizes that once bitten, one is indeed mad, thus it is imperative to understand this deeply. This illness is severe, yet many in the world treat it lightly and do not regard it seriously, which leads to deaths occurring regularly. When I first learned medicine, I did not take it up professionally; there were those who encountered this ailment but when they consulted me, I genuinely did not know how to respond, resulting in several patients dying under my care.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>From this point on, I resolutely dedicated myself to study, and having solved it, all those in charge became better. It became evident that there are no good doctors in the world, and those who die wrongfully are many; this is not an exaggeration. Therefore, future learners should not stop at this method. I believe all medical prescriptions must be contemplated deeply, attentively studied, and earnestly learned to gain thorough understanding. One should not think that knowing one or two methods is sufficient; that would be a great self-deception.</p>
<p>Whenever a dog bites a person, symptoms should appear within seven days; if they do not appear after twenty-one days, then the person is in the clear but should still be cautious for over a hundred days. Every seven days, one should drink one to two sheng of leek juice, and one should avoid eating dog meat and silkworm pupae for life; consuming these will provoke the disease, leading to inevitable death. While the wound is not healed, one should refrain from eating raw fish and all rich, cold foods; it is fine to eat steamed fish with rice, but not from rich dishes. Drinking alcohol should be avoided, ideally for over a year.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br><strong>The Qusheng (a type of insect)</strong></p>
<p>Whenever the shadow of the Qusheng urinates on someone, it causes diseases and sores. Its symptoms include sudden sharp pains in the body, akin to a thorn prick or the sting of an insect, followed by the emergence of small bumps that appear like the seeds of a berry, with red edges and a center filled with white pus resembling millet, causing intense pain to the flesh. The body experiences severe chills and high fever, with serious cases affecting the waist, sides, and chest. </p>
<p>The treatment method, upon first noticing the illness, is to grind rhino horn and apply it to stop the poison, treating it as one would with fire elixirs. During the Wude period in June, I contracted this ailment. After five to six days, I felt unsettled and my condition did not improve with other treatments. Someone else advised me to draw the shape of the Qusheng on the ground and carefully remove the soil from its abdomen with a knife, mixing it with saliva to make a paste and applying it. After reapplying, I was cured. This illustrates the interconnectedness of all things in the world, though the reasons remain unknown.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>In Jiangnan, there is a type of poisonous insect known as the short fox or the tian. This insect resembles a beetle. According to &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; it is pitch black, shaped like a large flying insect, with a long horn extending from its mouth, resembling the yoke of a crossbow. At the end of this horn, it curves like a bent bow, using air as an arrow to attack people based on the water&#39;s force. Sometimes, people hear it making a noise in the water and must fully submerge its mouth in water to attack. It is afraid of geese, which can eat it.</p>
<p>Initially, when symptoms appear, there are chills and shivering, with alternating hot and cold sensations, resembling a cold or being struck down. The person may be unable to speak, feeling slightly better in the morning but worsening in the evening, suffering from chaotic chills and heat. These are the symptoms. If not treated promptly within three to four days, those infected easily succumb by the seventh day. At first, there are no sores, but only the chills and shivering. Eventually, sores form that resemble a mix of weevil and urine, similar to boils and sores. There are three types of sores caused by this insect: one is dark black like a dye, with surrounding skin entirely red, which might feel prickly as if pierced by thorns; another type develops into a sore that persists for a long time, accompanied by intermittent chills and fever; the third type appears as if burned with fire and is the most urgent, killing within several days.</p>
<p>Whenever one encounters toxic insects in mountainous waters, those wading through might be affected like a shooting victim without a weapon. The diagnostic method involves initial chills, mild headache, pain around the eyes, inner agitation, shaking of the limbs, tightness in the waist and back, and pain in the knees. They may also experience alternating feelings of heat and cold, with an overwhelming desire to sleep, waking up with severe symptoms in the evening, and cold extremities.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>In two or three days, worms develop in the abdomen, feeding on the lower parts of the body, leading to sores in the anus that are painless and itchless, causing the person to remain unaware. If not treated urgently, after six or seven days, pus will emerge from the lower parts, the worms will start to eat the organs, and intense heat and toxins will lead to uncontrollable diarrhea. After eight or nine days, even skilled doctors will be unable to treat it. When recognized, one must examine the lower parts urgently; if there are sores that are bright red as if cut meat, this indicates Yang poison and is most urgent; if the sores resemble fish teeth, this indicates Yin poison and can be treated with less urgency. Both can be deadly, but not exceeding twenty days. To determine whether it is water poison or not, one should prepare five to six liters of broth, adding five liters of crushed garlic into the broth, ensuring it does not get too hot, and then straining it for bathing. If the body exhibits red spots due to the water poison, this confirms it; otherwise, it must be treated for another ailment.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>In the streams and sources of Jiangdong and Jiangnan, there is a worm known as the Short Fox Worm, also called the Shooting Worker. This worm is blind but has keen hearing; found in mountain springs and streams, it can detect human voices and shoots poison from its mouth, hence the name Shooting Worker. For those affected by this small, mildly toxic worm, when pursued, and if the worm hits a person&#39;s shadow, it does not immediately cause sores. Instead, symptoms appear first with chills and fever; the body dislikes the cold, physical strength may seem tense, headaches and eye pain occur, and there may be a constant cough with labored breathing. In the morning, there may be brief recovery, only to return to chills and fever in the evenings. Sometimes, when afflicted with cold damage, a person may feel as if struck by a corpse, becoming unable to speak, and the symptoms persist in this manner. Those unfamiliar with the local landscape, who do not frequently wander in mountain waters, may mistake these signs for cold damage from external forces, leading to improper treatments. As the poison intensifies and sores develop, it may further be mistaken for swellings; to the extent that nausea and vomiting of blood occurs, they might even fear it to be sorcery or poison, resulting in serious troubles. Now, this description delineates its characteristics to clarify its symptoms from those of cold damage.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong】</p>
<p><strong>Injury from Poisonous Insects and Snakes</strong></p>
<p>For injuries caused by poisonous insects and snakes, chew white atractylodes finely and apply it to the wound, and also take it mixed with alcohol. For centipede injuries, apply chicken droppings. For worm injuries, use the burnt ash of fern leaves mixed with fragrant oil for application. For dog bites, use ground tiger bone. For cat bites, apply mint. For bee and scorpion stings, chew ginseng and apply it, or use ground crab shells, burnt to retain their essence, mixed with honey for application. In all cases of injury from vicious creatures, it is also good to quickly cauterize the wound with moxa a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</strong> 【Ming Dynasty - Xue Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Accidental Swallowing of Leeches</strong></p>
<p>To treat the accidental swallowing of leeches, consuming honey can lead to recovery. If live leeches are thrown into honey, they will dissolve into liquid, as repeatedly observed. One book states that leeches found in wells can be eliminated by throwing in white horse bones, which has also been tested successfully. Leeches, or bloodsuckers, even if dead and ground to powder, can come back to life upon contact with water. Their ingestion can be quite harmful, and the aforementioned treatment has always been effective.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br><strong>Snake Enters the Seven Orifices</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a snake enters the seven orifices, split the snake&#39;s tail and insert several grains of Sichuan pepper, sealing it with paper. The snake will exit on its own. Then brew and drink ginseng broth; alternatively, consume wine and garlic to combat internal toxins. If bitten by a snake, eat garlic and drink wine; also use crushed garlic to apply to the wound and combine it with moxa for cauterization; the poison will be naturally resolved. This applies to all cases of venomous insect bites.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Caterpillar Injury</strong></p>
<p>In spring and summer months, beneath trees and in the gaps, there exists a type of striped caterpillar, which is extremely toxic. If a person makes contact, its hairs penetrate into the skin and flesh, reaching the bones. Initially, there may be slight itching on the skin, which gradually turns into pain; after several days, the external itching persists while internal pain develops. Scratching can worsen the condition, potentially leading to rotting flesh and a threat to life. This is known as the poison of the penetrating worker, and no medications are effective. </p>
<p>Use about a bowl of good fermented soybeans and half a cup of clear oil, mix and mash the soybeans, and apply a thick layer to the painful and itchy areas. After some time, the bean scent will reach the bones and draw out the caterpillar hairs, which will be visible. After removing the soybeans, bury them in the ground. Boil fragrant white angelica soup to wash the painful areas. If the flesh has already rotted, use crushed cuttlefish bone or fishbone as a powder to apply, and it will heal. For injuries from insects, licorice works wonders. Chew finely and apply it to the mouth for immediate relief. In present-day Suzhou, beneath Tiger Hill, local families depend on planting trees, and there are no insects within a ten-mile radius, likely due to the use of licorice juice to sprinkle on the trees.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br><strong>Stone Chamber&#39;s Secret Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong><br><strong>Treatment for Insect and Animal Bites</strong><br>When a person is bitten by a tiger, blood will flow profusely, and the wound will immediately fester, causing unbearable pain. Quickly use pork to apply to the wound; as the meat melts, replace it frequently. Additionally, use one pound of earthworm finely ground, combined with three taels of the root of Notopterygium, and four taels of Sofu, mix well. Apply as needed; the bleeding will stop and the pain will subside. Earthworm cools the blood, Sofu alleviates pain, and the root of Notopterygium stops bleeding; the combination of these three ingredients is therefore remarkably effective.</p>
<p><strong>Realgar Disinfectant Ointment</strong><br><strong>[From &quot;Precious Mirror&quot;]</strong><br>For intolerable scorpion stings:<br>Realgar, ½ tael; 3 qian of Croton; 1 tael of raw alum.<br>Grind these into a fine powder.

<p>For bites from various insects: Grind indigo and realgar in equal parts, dissolve two qian (a weight unit) in fresh water, and apply externally.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br>When a person is poisoned by the celestial snake, it resembles leprosy but is not leprosy. The celestial snake refers to the yellow flower spider of the grass. When a person is stung by it, the dew causes the illness, and thus, boiling a liter of Qinpi juice and drinking it heals the ailment.</p>
<p>For a sting from a spider: lightly tap a small hole in a raw chicken egg, and seal the bite area; it will heal immediately.</p>
<p>For injuries from various poisonous insects: dip a large paper twist in fragrant oil, burn it, and let the smoke heal the wounds.</p>
<p>The poisoning from a flower spider is no different from that of a venomous snake. Crush a cup of cang&#39;er (Xanthium) juice and consume it, applying the residue to the bite.</p>
<p>In the mountains, there are stone leeches that, when attached to a person’s foot, penetrate the skin and injure. Simply apply pig fat mixed with salt to the legs and toes, and they will not attach to a person.</p>
<p>In the south, where it rains often, there is something called the water nephew, resembling mucus, that grows on ancient trees. When it senses human breath, it twitches; if a person passes beneath it and it falls onto them, it will create sores, spreading over time. Only by applying cinnabar and musk will it heal.</p>
<p>If a person is bitten by a snail and is poisoned all over: soak them in smartweed juice, and they will heal.</p>
<p>For a hundred insects entering the ear: using two knives, rub and tap around the ear entrance to encourage them to exit.</p>
<p>For injuries from various poisonous insects: grind equal parts of indigo and realgar into a powder, then take two qian with freshly drawn water.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br><strong>Snail Bite:</strong> For those affected by poison throughout the body, soak in water boiled with smartweed, and recovery will be swift. It is not advisable to approach the shade as it weakens one.</p>
<p><strong>Cure for Yellow Fly Poison:</strong> In the Wumeng Mountain Gorge, there are many small yellow flies that generate venom in their scales. When bitten, one feels no initial pain but experiences gradual itching leading to sores. Do not scratch; instead, water it with cold water and apply a little salt, which will prevent it from becoming a sore.</p>
<p><strong>Insect Bite Treatment:</strong> Apply oil made from purple root. Another method is to mix ghee with blood and apply it.</p>
<p><strong>Caterpillar Poison Treatment:</strong> Take the white juice from dandelion roots and stems to apply directly, and healing will be immediate. Another method: use finely ground yellow earth from the bottom of a pot, knead it with vinegar into a ball, and rub it on the itchy painful area. The hairs will come off, and pain and itching will cease immediately, proving remarkably effective.</p>
<p>During summer, there are variably colored caterpillars that are extremely toxic, causing sores and intense pain; the flesh may rot. Use one bowl of fermented soybeans and half a cup of clear oil, mash together and apply thickly to the affected area overnight. The next day, check for caterpillars in the soybean mixture and bury them in the ground. Wash the area with a white ginger decoction, then apply ground fish bones, and healing will occur.</p>
<p><strong>Fumigation to Remove Lice:</strong> Lay down nightshade leaves on a mat, and by the next day, fleas and lice will be completely dead. Nightshade, also known as the black nightshade or old crow’s eye grass.</p>
<p><strong>Fumigation to Remove Lice:</strong> Grind hundred-leaf herb and gentian into a powder, place it in a bamboo container, and burn to create smoke which will cause the lice to fall off; it can also be used to wash clothing in soup.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>In May, gather floating pondweed, dry it in the shade, and burn it to drive away mosquitoes. </p>
<p>For bedbugs, use wheat straw to make cakes and burn them to produce smoke.</p>
<p>To eliminate bedbugs, slice papaya and lay it under the mat.</p>
<p>For itching caused by pubic lice, if bugs like lice appear in the flesh near the pubic hair, either red or white and causing unbearable itching, chew the white fruit kernel finely and rub it frequently; it will take effect.</p>
<p>Dried neem flowers laid under the mat can kill fleas and lice.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: Generally, when spring and summer first intersect, dogs frequently become rabid. If you see a dog with its tail held straight down and not curled, and it has drool and a black tongue, that is a rabid dog. If bitten, it is a serious condition with a survival rate of only one in nine. Urgently use a needle to draw blood, wash it clean with human urine, fill half of the peach pit shell with human excrement, cover the wound with it, and apply moxibustion. When the shell is charred and the excrement is dry, it can be removed. Apply moxibustion until achieving a hundred strong burns; the next day do another hundred, continuing to three to five hundred robust burns until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>For those bitten by a rabid dog, perform moxibustion directly on the bite mark, three times a day, until completing one hundred and twenty burns before stopping. Regular consumption of leeks prevents recurrence.</p>
<p>For bites from wild dogs, before the bad blood is fully expelled, perform moxibustion one hundred times, and then one burn each day thereafter. If blood does not come out, prick to draw the blood; stop moxibustion after one hundred days. Abstain from alcohol and meat from pigs and dogs.</p>
<p>For bites from numerous snakes, apply moxibustion three to seven times.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>Without moxa, use a fire stick to burn the size of the wound. The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: For snake, centipede, and poisonous snake bites, perform five or seven moxibustions on the affected area, and it will heal. The &quot;Zisheng Fang&quot; mentions: If bitten by a rabid dog, first bleed out the evil blood with a needle, then perform ten moxibustions on the wound; afterwards, moxibustion once daily until a hundred days have passed. Avoid drinking alcohol. Regularly drink natural juice of leek to seal and moxibustion the wound, preventing recurrence. The &quot;Medical Principles&quot; says: For dog bites, if the poison remains and causes cold and fever, promptly perform two moxibustions on the outer hill acupoint; also moxibustion seven times on the bitten area for immediate recovery. To treat bites from fierce dogs, use half a peach kernel shell filled with dry human feces from the wild, cover it with elm bark, and apply it to the wound; also burn moxa on the peach kernel fourteen times for recovery, preventing recurrence. Alternatively, wild dog feces can be used and treated as above. Another method: Moxibustion on the wound five to seven times.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: When one is bitten by various insects or snakes, applying moxa to the affected area several times is very effective. For a snakebite, take a whole garlic clove, cut it into three pieces, press it against the bite site, and apply moxa on top, allowing the garlic&#39;s essence to penetrate and promote healing. If bitten by a poisonous snake, one should place snake skin on the bite area and use moxa to draw out the venom.</p>
<p>In a medical case record from &quot;Yijian Zhi&quot;, it is said that a person in Linchuan was bitten by a viper and immediately fell unconscious, with one arm swelling to the size of a thigh. After a while, the entire body showed yellow-black swelling. A person took freshly drawn water, mixed it with one pound of fragrant white angelica powder, and administered it; the patient felt a bubbling sensation in the stomach, followed by yellow fluid coming out of the mouth, with a foul odor that was hard to endure. After a long while, the body shrank back to its original state. It is also mentioned that using a mixture of wheat kernel soup is particularly effective, alongside applying the powder on the skin.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>At Jing Mountain Temple, a monk was bitten by a snake, resulting in a severely rotten foot that did not heal despite various treatments. A visiting monk cleaned the wound with fresh water several times, and upon discovering white tendons exposed, he mixed a small amount of white angelica powder, human gall, and musk into it. As a result, foul water began to drain out, and this process was repeated daily, eventually leading to recovery after a month.</p>
<p>In the case notes of Xue Ji, it states: Chen Yi, a resident of Juyong Pass, was stung on the hand by a scorpion, causing excruciating pain that radiated to his side, chills and heat, and severe headache and nausea. This was a result of the conflict between the pathogenic and the normal energies. Despite applying the Flying Dragon Life Snatching Pills to the affected area and taking pain relief medications, he saw no effect. Eventually, by using the garlic moxibustion method, he was cured. My mother and I have also been stung before, and using the same method, the pain ceased immediately. My mother also once had her finger injured by a centipede, and using the same method, she recovered. For injuries caused by snake venom, treating them this way has proven effective. The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; mentions that garlic can treat wound toxins and has the ability to restore life, which is indeed true!</p>
<p>A hunter suffered a severe bite on his leg from a wolf, and treatment with frankincense pain relief powder was ineffective. I reasoned that in such a Yin condition, qi and blood had congealed, making it difficult for medicine to penetrate. I instructed him to undergo garlic moxibustion over fifty times, after which the pain completely subsided. I then applied tonifying medications and plasters for further healing.</p>
<p>Wang Sheng was bitten on the leg by a dog, and shortly thereafter experienced sharp pain radiating to his thigh. The next day his jaw was tight and urgent, and treatment with the Jade True Powder showed no effect. Again, after undergoing garlic moxibustion for over thirty times, he recovered, and then he used Jade True Powder and tonifying disinfectant medications, leading to complete healing.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Zhang Jian was once a judge in the Jian Nan region under Zhang Ting Shang. Suddenly, he was bitten on the neck by a spotted spider. By the next morning, the bite area had developed two red lines, thick and thin like chopsticks, wrapping around from the top of his head down to his chest, reaching the heart. By the second day, his face and head were swollen and painful, nearly reaching a size comparable to a bowl. His abdomen also began to swell, bringing him to the brink of death. Zhang valued the recommendation highly, so he allocated five hundred thousand from his family’s wealth and likewise requested five hundred thousand from his family to find a healer. Suddenly, a person responded, claiming to be able to treat him. At first, Zhang did not believe him much and wanted to test his methods, so he ordered the preparation of the medicine in front of him. The man said he wouldn&#39;t spare any formula as he was treating a person’s life. He then took a large bowl of indigo juice and added the spider into it, leaving it for a long time until it emerged, very weak and unable to move. He then ground the indigo juice again and mixed it with musk and realgar, adding another spider into the mixture, which immediately turned into liquid. Zhang and the others were very surprised, and they applied it to the bite area. Within two days, he was completely healed, but the bite site had turned into small sores, with scabs falling off as usual.</p>
<p>There was also a case where a person was poisoned by a snake and had lost consciousness. An old monk gave him a two-qian dose mixed with wine to drink, and he regained consciousness. He then used the residue from the medicine to apply to the affected area, and after a while, he again administered a two-qian dose, which alleviated all the bitterness. Upon questioning, it was revealed that the ingredients were one ounce of five-spirit resin and half an ounce of realgar, ground into powder; that was all there was. Later, those who were poisoned used it, and it proved effective on all occasions.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　破伤风论</p>
<p>　　夫风病者，百病之始也。清净则腠理闭拒，虽有大风苛毒而弗能为害也。故破伤风者，通于表里，分别阴阳，同伤寒证一例施治。闾阎庸鄙，往往有不知者。只知有发表者，不知有攻裹者、和解者。此汗下和三法也，亦同伤寒证。有在表者，有在里者，有在半表里者。在里宜下，在表宜发汗，在表里之间宜和解。然汗下亦不可过其法也。故破伤风者，从外至内，甚于内者则病甚也。因此卒暴伤损风袭之间，传播经络，至使寒热更作，身体反强，口噤不开，甚者邪气入脏，则分汗下之治。诸疮不差，荣卫虚，肌肉不生，疮眼不合者，风邪亦能外入于疮，为破伤风之候，故诸疮不差。吁！世皆言着灸为上，而不知火热客毒逐经，诸变不可胜数。微则发热，甚则生风而搐，或角弓反张，口噤目斜，皆因疮郁结于荣卫，不得宣通而然。亦有破伤不灸而病此者。疮着白痂，则疮口闭塞，气难通泄，故阳热易为郁结，而热甚则生风也。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>故表脉浮而无力者太阳也，脉长而有力者阳明也，脉浮而弦小者少阳也。太阳宜汗，阳明宜下，少阳宜和。若明此三法，而治不中病者，未之有也。　　破伤风，风热燥甚，怫郁在表，而里气尚平者，善伸数欠，筋脉拘急，或时恶寒，或筋惕而搐，脉浮数而弦也，宜以辛热治风之药，开冲结滞而愈。犹伤寒表热怫郁，而以麻黄汤辛热发散也。凡用辛热开冲风热结滞，宜以寒药佐之则良，免致药中病而风热转甚也。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>如治伤寒发热，用麻黄、桂枝加黄芩、知母、石膏之类是也。若止以甘草、滑石、葱、豉寒药发散甚妙。若表不已，渐传入里，里未大甚而脉弦小者，宜以退风热开结滞之寒药调之，或微加散风辛热药亦得。犹伤寒在半表半里，而以小柴胡和解之也。若里势已甚，而舌强口噤，项背反张，惊惕搐搦，涎唾稠粘，胸腹满塞，便溺秘结，或时汗出，脉沉洪数而弦也。然汗出者由风热郁甚于里，而表热稍罢，则腠理疏泄而心火热甚，故汗出也。法宜除风散结寒药下之，后以退风热开结滞之寒药调之，则热退结散而风自愈矣。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　活法机要 【元　张洁古】</p>

<p><strong>Huang Di&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The liver pulse is firm and long, but the color is not blue; this indicates the condition is due to a fall or impact. Blood is retained beneath the ribs, causing shortness of breath. <em>(Note: The liver governs blood and color; when the pulse is strong but color is not visible, it indicates blood is stored below. The condition arises from falls or injuries caused by impacts, leading to blood clotted under the ribs, hence the shortness of breath.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jinkui Yaolüe</strong> <em>(Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Pulse Signs of Severe Wounds</strong></p>
<p>The pulse at the inch is slightly floating and weak; it indicates loss of blood, similar to sweating. If there is no sweating, the body has wounds caused by knives or axes, resulting in loss of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Classics</strong> <em>(Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe)</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If one falls from a height and has internal bleeding, with abdominal distension, a firm pulse indicates survival; a weak pulse indicates death. If the bleeding from a severe wound is excessive, a weak and fine pulse suggests survival, while a strong and frequent pulse indicates death. If there is bleeding from a severe wound and the pulse is small and deep, survival is more likely; if it is floating and strong, death is likely. If a cut causes bleeding of one or two sheng (a unit of weight), a strong pulse indicates death within twenty days. For continuous bleeding from cuts, a strong and frequent pulse indicates death within seven days; a smooth and fine pulse indicates survival.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>For Treating Injuries from Blows</strong></p>
<p>Whenever one is injured from a blow, if blood stagnates and the heart feels compressed, making it impossible to speak, one can pry open the mouth and let urine run into it to induce revival. Similarly, for those who have fallen from a carriage or horse, or have been crushed under wheels and appear dead, one should place the deceased comfortably and cover the mouth, nose, and eyes with a sleeve for a brief moment. After a short while, they may live again, opening their eyes and producing warm urine. </p>
<p><strong>For Treating Metal Wounds</strong></p>
<p>To treat metal wounds, regardless of size or season, as soon as the injury occurs and blood flows, one should apply a thick layer of lime to stop the pain and promote quick healing. If lime is unavailable, ash may be used instead. If the wound is very deep and should not heal quickly, add a bit of talcum powder to prevent closure. Generally, when metal wounds bleed, the person will feel thirsty and should endure it. Eating dry foods or fatty foods to quench the thirst is advised, while avoiding salty foods. If one consumes too much porridge or gruel, it can cause blood to flow excessively and be lethal. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid anger, loud talking, laughter, speculation on yin and yang, physical labor, excessive consumption of sour or salty foods, hot alcohol, and other similar things. Even after the wound heals, these precautions should be observed for at least a hundred days to half a year before returning to normal activities. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Tetanus</strong></p>
<p>Wind diseases are the beginning of all ailments. When the body is clear and calm, the pores are closed and protected; thus, even when faced with harsh winds and poisons, they cannot cause harm. Hence, tetanus aligns with both the exterior and interior, differentiating between yin and yang, and is treated similarly to typhoid. In humble villages, there are often those who lack knowledge. They only recognize external manifestations and are unaware of conditions that affect the interior or require harmonization. This includes the methods of sweating, purging, and harmonizing, which also align with typhoid symptoms. There are those with conditions on the surface, those within, and those in between. For internal issues, purging is appropriate; for surface conditions, sweating is suitable; and for those in between, harmonization is best. However, sweating and purging must not exceed their limits. Thus, tetanus arises from outside to inside, with more severe internal symptoms indicating a more serious illness. Consequently, injuries from sudden trauma, alongside wind attacks, propagate through the meridians, causing alternating chills and fever, leading to a tightened body and an inability to open the mouth. In severe cases, malign energy enters the organs, necessitating purgative treatment. No sores heal, the vitality is weak, and the flesh does not regenerate; the openings of sores do not close properly, allowing wind pathogens to enter from the outside, resulting in tetanus-like symptoms, hence no sores heal. Alas! The world commonly claims that moxibustion is supreme, but fails to realize that heat from fire and toxic influences disrupt the meridians, leading to countless variations. Mild cases may cause fever, while severe cases can induce wind and spasms, or lead to bent limbs and inability to open the mouth or misaligned eyes, all due to the stagnation of energy and vitality from the sores, preventing proper circulation. There are also cases of tetanus without moxibustion treatment. When a sore has white scabs, the opening closes up, making it difficult for energy to flow and drain; thus, yang heat easily becomes stagnant, and excessive heat can give rise to wind.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, a floating pulse that is weak indicates the Taiyang (greater yang), a long and strong pulse indicates the Yangming (bright yang), and a floating and thin pulse indicates the Shaoyang (lesser yang). For Taiyang, sweating is appropriate; for Yangming, purging is suitable; and for Shaoyang, harmonizing is the way. If one understands these three methods, and treats without matching the illness, it has never been the case.</p>
<p>For tetanus, when wind-heat is severe and there is stagnation at the surface, but the interior Qi remains balanced, there may be good extension of pulses, with tendons and pulses tight; sometimes there can be a feeling of cold or spasms, with floating, rapid, and thin pulses. In such cases, it is advisable to use warming and spicy herbs to treat the wind, releasing the blockage and achieving recovery. This is akin to treating a surface heat and stagnation of wind-cold with Ma Huang Decoction for warming and dispersing.</p>
<p>In general, when using warming and spicy herbs to open wind-heat stagnation, it is beneficial to assist with cooling herbs to avoid causing illness with the medicinal herbs and worsening the wind-heat condition.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

If only licorice, talc, green onions, and fermented soybeans are used, they can effectively disperse cold. If the exterior symptoms persist and gradually progress inward, with a slight, wiry pulse indicating that the interior is not yet severely disturbed, one should use herbs to dispel wind-heat and alleviate the stagnant cold, or slightly add dispersing, pungent, and warming herbs. This is akin to using Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) to harmonize when the condition is half exterior and half interior. If the interior condition is severe, with a stiff tongue, locked jaws, backward-arching neck and back, restlessness, spasms, thick and sticky saliva, a feeling of fullness in the chest and abdomen, constipation, or intermittent sweating, with a pulse that is deep, forceful, rapid, and wiry, this indicates that the sweat is caused by wind-heat severely affecting the interior, and the exterior heat has somewhat subsided. Consequently, the pores are open and heart fire is intense, leading to sweating. The treatment principle should involve dispelling wind and relieving the cold blockage, and then applying herbs to dispel wind-heat and alleviate stagnation, allowing the heat to recede, the blockage to disperse, and restoring health.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Essentials of Living: On Falling Injuries</h3>
<p>When one falls from a height, bad blood accumulates internally and affects the twelve meridians. Physicians often diagnose this as a wind-attack on the liver meridian, with symptoms manifesting in the lower ribs. Blood is primarily governed by the liver, and bad blood will inevitably return to the liver, regardless of which meridian is affected, as the liver is the master of blood. If there is severe pain, it will likely cause sweating. However, since everyone sweats, this is associated with wind disorders, all of which belong to the liver wood. Moreover, with stagnant blood congealed, it counteracts its proper place and enters the liver.</p>
<p>In cases of falling from a height, the upward-acting blood and qi are disturbed; this is attributed to the liver. If there is no sweating, it may not be a cold injury, but once there is sweating, it must be influenced by wind, thus requiring treatment with blood-dispersing herbs.</p>
<p>In situations involving fall from a height or blunt force trauma, where there is accumulated stagnant blood in the chest and abdomen, it is essential to differentiate between the upper, middle, and lower jiao (organs). For the upper region, use formulas like Lao Xijiao Di Huang Decoction. For the middle, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction. For the lower area, something like Didao Decoction can be prescribed. Additionally, these can be combined with urines or wine for decoction.</p>
<p>There are also methods that include raw Rehmannia and Angelica in the decoctions, or those that combine with Da Huang. Individuals with deficiency who cannot withstand purgation may take Siwu Decoction with added pangolin for effective treatment. There&#39;s also Huasui Shi San, which can be prepared with a boy’s urine or taken with wine. </p>
<p>This medicine pairs with previous cold-reducing remedies, emphasizing the importance of discerning between yin and yang. Once the stagnant blood has been resolved, one can take Fuyuantongqi San with added Angelica for further benefit.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falls and Struggles</strong></p>
<p>A fall is called a &quot;diān&quot; when one doesn&#39;t know it, and &quot;pū&quot; when two clash; both result in harm. Those who are dizzy and mentally disturbed from falls and struggles can take Su He Xiang pills mixed with wine, or Jing Ming powder, or a Qi Harmonizing drink with a bit of rhubarb boiled and mixed with vinegar; or use children’s urine to mix with the black spirit powder (or substitute it with liquor boiled with sandalwood). For pain from falls and struggles, mixing wine with amber powder is excellent. Additionally, use Wu Yao to regulate Qi, especially effective for back pain due to falls. If individuals who have fallen take medicine and use inhalation and topical applications without effect, advise them to use equal parts of white peony, red peony, Wei Ling Xian, frankincense, and myrrh, grind them to fine powder, mix with wine and take; this will immediately relieve half of the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Knife Wounds</strong></p>
<p>For knife wounds with uncontrollable bleeding, use only white peony powder mixed with white wine, and apply the powder directly to the wound. If the blood is not flowing freely and is causing stagnation with redness and swelling at the wound, or affecting limbs and head, consider using Jing Ming powder or boiling safflower mixed with black spirit powder. If there is difficult-to-stop bleeding, use dragon bone and frankincense in equal parts, ground to powder and pressed into the affected area; using snake fish grass as a poultice is especially effective. This method is not only good for knife wounds but also for continuous bleeding from falls.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tetanus</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Wind is the source of all diseases. When the body is clear and pure, the pores are closed, and even strong winds or toxic influences cannot cause harm. However, concerning tetanus, injuries that break the skin and flesh are often regarded as ordinary matters. Little do people realize that the wind pathogen takes advantage of this vulnerability to invade, gradually turning into a severe condition. If sores do not heal properly, the wind pathogen can also invade from within. Whether through bathing in decoctions or cauterizing with moxa, the toxic gas from these methods is not different from the tetanus pathogen. The symptoms can spread through the meridians, burning the vital energy; hence, alternating cold and heat occurs. In severe cases, the jaw may lock, eyes may become misaligned, and the body becomes rigid, resembling a bow drawn tight, leading to death in a short time, which is indeed pitiable. </p>
<p>The method of treatment should align with that of typhoid fever since there are three differing conditions: on the surface, internally, or a combination of both. Therefore, treatment involves sweating for surface conditions, purging for internal conditions, and harmonizing for cases in between. Moreover, one should not exceed these methods. Common folks often do not recognize this condition, making it easy to result in fatality.

<p><strong>Fractures</strong></p>
<p>Fractures can injure the body, whether from falls, blows, or crushing, causing qi and blood to stagnate and break. Injuries from sharp metal or cuts that cause external bleeding can be treated; however, injuries to internal organs, membranes, or the Yin substance behind the ears are untreatable. </p>
<p>For those who have not bled, it is advisable to use lithospermum to resolve stagnation, Coptis to reduce fire, and Atractylodes to harmonize the middle. These three ingredients should be combined with children’s urine and boiled in wine for oral administration. Those with upper body injuries should consume it with leeks and porridge, while those with lower body injuries may take it directly. If the blood is cold, it will coagulate; one must not drink cold water, as blood entering the heart leads to death.</p>
<p>For resolving stagnation, one can use the Rooster Call Powder, Flower Bud Stone Powder, or Fragrant Wood Qi Harmonization Powder, mixed with children’s urine, red yeast rice, or red wine. If there has been bleeding, quickly use Chen Wang Dan to stop the bleeding. Begin with tonic medicines before resolving stagnation. In cases of extreme deficiency, one must also avoid purging. For blood deficiency, Four Substance Decoction with added pangolin should be used. For Qi deficiency, one may take lithospermum, ginseng, astragalus, danggui, tangerine peel, and licorice for half a month; if the pulse becomes less scattered, one can cautiously take an herbal decoction mixed with natural copper powder on an empty stomach, avoiding it if the bone is not fractured. For substantial deficiency, use purple river car and eliminate musk.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of injury, the essence lies in replenishing qi and blood; if affected by cold, one should first disperse the cold. Blood issues from injuries primarily pertain to blood itself, unlike the six excesses or seven emotions, which have distinctions in relation to qi and blood. However, since the liver governs blood, regardless of the meridian affected, any stagnant blood will inevitably return to the liver, flowing to the side and causing accumulation in the abdomen, resulting in distension and pain, or alternating cold and heat. In cases of excess, one should purgative; in cases of deficiency, one should use whether to disperse or to restore with blood-activating decoctions, or with the Shiquan Dabu Decoction, adding ingredients like Xiangfu, Chenpi, and Fritillaria in equal parts, decocted in water for consumption.</p>
<p>When an injury suddenly dries out at the wound, and toxins attack internally, leading to confusion, vexation, nausea, and significant bleeding along with persistent vomiting of blood, these are difficult to treat. For early vomiting, use Pingwei Powder taken internally, and apply ginger juice externally. For tetanus-related swelling, Jiangtiao Pills are indicated; if qi is weak, only the honey guiding method should be utilized.</p>
<p>Whether due to excessive initial bleeding or early closure of the wound, leading to stagnant blood, it is all indicative of blood being affected. Blood is yin, governed by the five zang organs; though it may initially be superficial, it quickly penetrates inward, often resulting in death. Therefore, nourishing blood with decoctions like Danggui Dihuang Tang, Huoshen Dan, Tuo Li San, and Neituo Shixuan San can prevent toxin infiltration. Externally, use fish bladder powder, or grind mouse skull into powder and mix with lard for application.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p>Zhang Chuang should not be treated according to the law. According to ancient methods, breaking the stasis and expelling blood is the priority. After one stroke, drink a mixture of children&#39;s urine and wine; do not consume tea to avoid aggravating the heart with blood. Once the spirit has settled, for those with a robust physique, use Ji Ming San to assist. For those with a weaker constitution, if the sore brings about cold and heat, nausea, or reduced appetite, it is advisable to use a formula of angelica root with additional Chai Hu and Qiang Huo. If there is stagnation of qi, add Mu Xiang; if there is bloating and pain in the heart and abdomen, add children&#39;s urine; if there is fullness beneath the heart and qi is not flowing smoothly, add Mu Xiang and Betel Nut. For external treatment, use hot tofu to cover the affected area; its warmth will promote steaming, and the flesh will turn purple; then cover it again with hot tofu until the purple flesh fades to a light red. This is also appropriate for purulent and decaying wounds. For severe cases, take internal herbal mixtures with myrrh to relieve pain, supplemented with as much hot wine as possible. If the patient is weak, after the sore has healed, it is essential to nourish qi and blood, as well as the spleen and stomach, along with swallowing Zi He Che Dan (a type of tonic), for the best recovery. Externally, apply yellow wax ointment and purslane ointment. If Zhang Chuang suddenly dries out and there is internal toxicity causing abdominal pain, confusion, nausea, and vomiting, it is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h2>Xue&#39;s Medical Case Study</h2>
<h3>Main Treatment Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>For hypochondriac and rib distension with pain, normal bowel movement, and coughing with phlegm, this indicates liver fire injuring the lungs. Use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Qing Pi and Shan Zhi to clear it. If there is abdominal distension with pain, constipation, and coughing up blood, this indicates stagnant blood. Use Dang Gui Da Zhi San to relieve it. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the liver stores blood, and the spleen regulates blood. The liver belongs to wood, which generates fire that harms earth, leading to intense liver fire, which must injure liver blood and weaken spleen qi. First, clear the liver and nourish the blood to prevent stagnant blood from coagulating and tissues from breaking down. Next, strengthen the spleen and enhance digestion so that stagnant flesh can dissipate and new flesh can regenerate. If aggressive measures are taken, the weak will become weaker, and the stagnant will become more stagnant, leading to inevitable disaster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For abdominal pain, or constipation with severe pain upon pressure, this indicates internal stagnant blood. Use modified Cheng Qi Decoction to purge it. If the pain continues after purging and still hurts upon pressure, this indicates that stagnant blood has not been completely cleared. Use modified Si Wu Decoction to tonify and promote its movement. If abdominal pain does not hurt upon pressure, this indicates injury to blood and qi. Use Si Wu Decoction plus Ren Shen, Qi, and Bai Zhu to tonify and harmonize.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p>

If there is internal bleeding causing pain, it indicates deficiency of the spleen and stomach energy; use the Spleen-Boosting Qi-Tonifying Decoction. If there is external injury causing bleeding and pain, it indicates deficiency of the spleen and lung energy; use the Eight-Treasure Decoction. Generally, if there is persistent bleeding, it indicates collapse of the spleen and stomach energy. If there is vomiting and diarrhea without appetite, it indicates failure of the spleen and stomach energy. If one takes preventive measures to regulate and nourish the spleen and stomach, such issues will not occur.</p>
<p>If the pain persists for four to five days without relief, or recurs after one or two days, becoming pustular, use the Suppressing and Expelling Toxin Powder.

If headaches occur intermittently, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood; if the pain is accompanied by dizziness, it relates to phlegm. Hence, nourish the liver blood and replenish the spleen energy.</p>
<p>If a swelling does not dissipate, use the Spleen-Boosting Qi-Tonifying Decoction to strengthen qi; if the swelling is dark and does not go away, use the Enhanced Relaxing Decoction to disperse blood.

If blood flows and breaks, the spleen and stomach become more deficient, and the movement of qi becomes stagnated. If cool external medicines are applied, blood stasis worsens, internal decay deepens, leading to complicated issues.</p>
<p>For a fever that arises from excessive bleeding or after pus drains, with a rapid and weak pulse that feels empty upon pressing, this indicates yin deficiency leading to fever; use Angelica Blood Supplement Decoction. If the pulse is deep and weak, it reflects an excess of yin leading to agitation; use Four Gentlemen with ginger and prepared Aconite. If fever and agitation arise with muscle twitching and tendons being tense, it signifies loss of blood; use Sheng Yu Decoction. If sweating is unceasing, leading to blood loss, use Alone Ginseng Decoction. If blood loss presents a strong pulse, while a restless pulse after sweating is difficult to treat, a thin and weak pulse is easier to manage. </p>

Bones may be broken, but tendons can reconnect, and there is no need to rush in cutting off; if it affects healthy flesh, then it is untreatable.

If there is already a bowel movement and sweating continues, the exterior is weak; therefore, use Baizhu and Fangfeng decoction to replenish it, and periodically administer gruel as well.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What has been previously stated concerns the method of treating conditions where the qi is still empty but has not been damaged. If there is a large loss of pus and blood, with yang dispersing along with yin, resulting in both qi and blood being deficient, and the symptoms resemble those mentioned earlier, it is essential to greatly tonify the spleen and stomach, and completely avoid medicines that dispel wind.</p>
<p>Regarding spasms, Zhongjing stated that all spasms with a stiff neck are due to dampness. He also mentioned that excessive sweating in the case of a taiyang disease can lead to spasms. In cases of wind diseases, purging can cause spasms to recur, and sweating can lead to a feeling of tightness. If a patient has sweated but does not feel cold, it is termed &quot;soft spasms,&quot; as wind can disperse qi; the recommended treatment is Baizhu Decoction with added cassia twigs and astragalus. If there is no sweating but the patient feels cold, it is termed &quot;hard spasms,&quot; as cold can congeal blood; the recommended treatment is Gegen Decoction. These conditions arise from internal injuries to blood and qi, where the tendons are not properly nourished, and are not caused by wind. </p>
<p>For those with ulcerated wounds or injuries that lead to variations in qi and blood, it is necessary to tonify both blood and qi; the appropriate treatment is to use Dushen Decoction. If the hands and feet are cold, add cassia and asarum; if the condition is alleviated but not resolved, it requires further intervention.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Injuries</strong></p>
<p>The discussion on injuries states: Injuries must be traced back to their source, examining the severity of the condition and the depth of the damage. In a person&#39;s body, from head to toe, there are cuts, bruises, falls, and various injuries from sharp objects. Each of these injuries has its own explanations; for a physician, it is crucial to understand both the internal and external aspects before administering treatment. However, if a physician lacks understanding, they cannot be considered a competent healer. Some individuals may be naturally dull-witted, unable to assess the severity of symptoms or the depth of injuries, and may hastily administer treatments without proper understanding, causing great harm. This can lead to phlegm and fluids attacking upwards or cause obstructions in the internal organs, where a minor mistake can result in significant consequences. Thus, the saying goes: &quot;A physician should not be trusted without careful prescribing; the treatment should not be taken lightly!&quot; This serves as a fundamental guideline for treating injuries. While it is essential to apply the correct medications, it is even more critical to execute treatments with precision. The human body has a total of 365 joints, which are itemized as follows.</p>
<p><strong>List of Joints</strong></p>
<p>The human body consists of 365 joints, with the first 165 corresponding to significant connections; starting from the clavicle upwards and including the head, extending to the front and back, there are 49 corresponding connections, totaling 72. The top of the skull is referred to as the cranial bone, which varies in density, marrow, and moisture. Next, the cranial bone serves as the next layer, also varying in density and marrow.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

Use a chair for the affected person to reach out with both hands into the left cavity, the right shelf, and the five basic bones, totaling three hundred sixty bones. Furthermore, there are one hundred ninety bones in men and women, some hidden, some supporting, and some lacking marrow; the remaining two hundred fifty-six bones have marrow fluid that is stored in the muscles, meeting the pulses and valleys, needed to form the body’s shape, referred to as the four greats. This is the standard for bone measurement.</p>
<p>For injuries to the head, eyes, nose, or ears: If the cranial bones are fractured, apply light pressure to stabilize them. If the skin is intact, use anti-swelling ointment for application. If the skin is broken and flesh is damaged, first use a sealing medicine to treat it, then apply a hemostatic ointment outside. If there is bleeding, use a hemostatic powder to treat it. For swelling and pain, apply mashed kudzu leaves, hair vine leaves, or the tails of maple leaves, ensuring that they do not come in contact with wind or water, for fear of developing tetanus.</p>
<p>Fractured cranial bones located at the temples can be treated. However, injuries at the temples themselves cannot be treated.

If it falls, bend the wrist again, stabilize it, and apply pain-relief and bone-setting ointments, then bind it with silk cloth.</p>
<p>For hand injuries: there are four bones in the hand that can dislocate and six joints. In the case of a dislocated arm, the upper segment is the joint, and the lower segment is the handle. The tendons around may also be damaged, causing dislocation. This bone must be pulled straight; one person pulls while another holds the bone steady to guide it back in place. Observe which side the bone has moved to, and use a piece of bamboo to hold one side, leaving the other side free, focused on the bent and straight portions. After applying medicine, do not let it be stable; continue to adjust as needed. Because there are many tendons here, if it is not straightened after the medicine, it may lead to complications, making the hand unable to move properly later on.</p>
<p>For dislocations at the shoulder: if the arm bone is dislocated downward, the body joint socket is dislocated upward, and it can occur on the left or right. Use a pestle and a low stool. Have the patient stand on the stool, using the pestle to push against the dislocated area. If lower, use something to lift it. If the pestle is long, adjust the stool.

Have the patient lie on it, extending their hands up to grasp the door, while three people pull and stretch from below. Apply pressure to the injured area for a prolonged period. Then use pain-relieving ointment and bone-setting ointment for application.

<p>For dislocations of the hip joint, where the right bone protrudes into the left and vice versa, push the foot in, steadying and aligning it carefully, and apply medicine. If the injury is inward, have the patient cross their legs and press on their shoulders, while the doctor uses their knee to push in; even though there may be significant pain for a moment, it will not matter. Realign it properly and then apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment. The patient should lie on their back and should not turn onto their side, as excessive movement may lead to further injury.</p>
<p>For injuries to the waist and legs, use alcohol in combination with blood circulation medicines, and always add eucommia bark.</p>

<p>To distinguish between internal and external dislocations of the hip joint, if there is no swelling at the knee, it indicates an inward dislocation; push inwards from the inside to align properly. If the knee is stuck and cannot open, it indicates an outward dislocation; push inwards from the outside to align properly, adapting to the situation.</p>
<p>For a dislocated ankle, have the patient sit comfortably. The practitioner should use their foot to press and shift the affected leg, while simultaneously gripping and shaking a couple of times. Then apply bone-setting ointment or injury ointment.</p>
<p>For knee injuries, after applying pressure to realign, use ointment on the front and secure with mulberry bark as a four-point wrap. If the kneecap is dislocated, use a bamboo brace to stabilize it, applying medication and securing it in place. It&#39;s crucial to apply the four-point wrap; otherwise, the knee will not stabilize.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is an injury from falling on the ankle bones or from the left and right foot, it should be straightened and pulled back in place using the foot, then pressed flat and treated with a topical plaster. If the knee cap dislocates, do not pull it too straight or too bent. If pulled straight, the bony edges aren’t visible, and the same applies if bent. It should be held halfway straight and halfway bent, using a bamboo hoop to secure the knee cap and binding it with rope. </p>
<p>For any fractures or dislocations of the joints, whether from falls affecting the arms, waist, or knees, one must use proper techniques to realign them. First, administer an anesthetic to eliminate pain, and only then can the hands be used to treat the injury. </p>
<p>For foot injuries, there are six dislocations and four fractures. Whenever there is a dislocation at the junction on the sole of the foot, someone must pull it while the other person manually adjusts the joint. If a bone is protruding inward, it should be pulled outward gently; conversely, if it is protruding outward, it must be forcefully pulled back inward to return it to its proper position. Merely pulling without adjusting the joint will cause chronic issues. It is advisable to apply bone-setting ointment and pain relief plaster. </p>
<p>For strapping: in the case of the four fractures, use proper and additional bindings; for the six dislocations, only fabric wraps are suitable, without binding. </p>
<p>For knee dislocations, the treatment is similar to that of the arm or elbow dislocations. Whether the dislocation is inward or outward, only one side should be secured. This area has a large number of tendons and meridians, so it requires constant attention and care.

Whether it dislocates forward or backward, one person must hold the afflicted person&#39;s body, while another pulls the leg, using all their strength to push it back into place. If the dislocation is severe, a soft cotton rope can be used to bind and hang the leg upside down, and the bones can be adjusted from above. Once repositioned, a bone-setting ointment or pain-relieving ointment should be applied and secured.</p>
<p>For injuries to the spine, if the vertebrae are misaligned, do not attempt to adjust them by hand. Instead, a soft rope should be used to suspend the feet and allow the body to hang straight down, allowing the bones to realign naturally. If the bones have not returned to position, do not use force to realign them. Once the bones are straight, apply either bone-setting ointment, pain-relieving ointment, or flesh-repairing ointment. Place a piece of mulberry bark on the medicine, followed by two or three pieces of cedar bark on top, and wrap them with a soft material to ensure they remain straight, applying the medicine properly.</p>
<p>For smashed bones in the hands or feet, anesthetics should be administered, or an incision should be made with a knife.

If the bone is fractured but the skin is intact, use wine to decoct the medicinal herbs for treatment. For injuries without broken bones or flesh, use swelling ointment or pain-relief ointment.</p>
<p>For cases where the skin is broken and the bone protrudes unevenly, pinch the skin around the area for about three points, and make a small incision with a sharp knife to push the bone back in. There is no need to cut the flesh, as it will rupture on its own, allowing the bone to be repositioned. After the bone is in place, apply a meat-repairing ointment around the wound and fill the wound opening with muscle-repairing powder. If the skin and flesh are intact, apply bone-setting ointment and pain-relief ointment.</p>
<p>If there is a break, there will certainly be bleeding; exert pressure and act swiftly. For instances where shards of bone are within the flesh, simply use pain-relief ointment and bone-setting ointment for application and secure it with binding.

<p>For fragmented bones, assess how aligned the area is. Generally, if a bone appears lower, the surrounding bones are uninjured; if it&#39;s higher, those bones will likely have suffered damage.

For applications, use a board with banana leaves or paper to spread the bone-setting paste or pain-relieving ointment on top, and then apply it to the injury. If there are broken bones under the skin, later the flesh will decay; one should first apply a muscle-repair powder, and then the flesh-repair ointment to help the fragments emerge. If the skin and flesh are torn, first use a sealing medicine to fill the wound and sew it with thread, then apply flesh-repair ointment and blood-stopping ointment externally.</p>
<p>For fractures where the bone is broken but the skin remains intact, simply use bone-setting ointment and pain-relieving ointment to bind and support the area. For joints in the hands and feet or areas that require movement, it is best to use light silk wraps to allow for periodic movement, avoiding tight bindings. If a finger bone is fractured, only use ramie to tie it. For leg injuries, use ramie rope. In winter, bind with warmth; in summer, with coolness; and in other months, with moderate warmth.</p>

<p>For binding and medicating: Generally, for binding, it should last three days in spring, two in summer, three in autumn, and four in winter. The binding area should be soaked with medicinal water, washing off the old medicine carefully without disturbing the injured area. After washing, continue to use the previous ointment for binding. If binding is necessary, use soft-immersed cedar wood stripped of its coarse bark and bamboo strips that are trimmed of yellow, making pieces about the size of a finger. Use cedar bark as the primary clamp and bamboo strips as the secondary clamp, loosely arranging them around the area. Bind it three times with small ropes, adjusting the height and distance to ensure the circulation of qi and blood in the injured area, allowing for both tightness and looseness, as stated before.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the remedy cannot be applied immediately, it is most convenient to use a balm with protective adhesive. When using a compress, the medicine must be spread evenly on paper, with both ends thin, ensuring the application is not too thick to avoid pressing on the flesh. It should be smooth and flat to prevent unevenness. If the edges are uneven, there will be gaps above that do not touch the flesh, which can lead to blisters; remember this! </p>
<p>For applying medicine that binds bones and alleviates pain, if the pain persists, add some of the following ingredients: frankincense, myrrh, balsam, angelica, cinnamon, rhizoma arisaema, and ligusticum. Adjust the quantities as needed for the application. This will warm the flesh and relieve pain. For injuries caused by knives or axes, omit cinnamon, rhizoma arisaema, and ligusticum.</p>
<p>When changing the medicine, do not replace it directly. Instead, dampen a cloth and use it to moisten the compress.

<p>For injuries caused by falling trees or from a height, these kinds of injuries disturb the limbs and organs, likely resulting in stagnant blood in the body, leading to nausea.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For any injuries causing pain from blows or impacts, this indicates stagnation of blood, and one should use blood-breaking medicine to address it. If the pain is unbearable, it is due to blood being injured; hence, a heart-clearing medicine is advisable. If the pain persists, using the &quot;Duxing San&quot; will be very effective.</p>
<p>For injuries from cutting or striking with axes or other implements, where blood gushes like a spring, it indicates injury to the meridians. One should use sealing medicines while pressing firmly with the hand; after a short while, the bleeding will stop. Additionally, a hemostatic powder may also be applied. If there is swelling and pain, one can pound scallions, fry them warm, and bind them to the area.</p>
<p>For any loss causing difficulty in urination or defecation, one should not hastily take remedies for loss, as these medicines are heat-inducing and should be taken with wine; otherwise, it will worsen constipation. Assess whether the patient is in a state of deficiency or excess: in cases of excess, use blood-breaking medications combined with &quot;Mucuna&quot; for better flow; if still obstructed, add &quot;Ming Xiao.&quot; In deficiency cases, use &quot;Si Wu Tang&quot; with the addition of &quot;Zhi Ke,&quot; &quot;Ma Ren,&quot; or &quot;Tao Ren&quot; for gentle bowel movement. For those who are deficient and cannot have a purgative, use &quot;Si Wu Tang&quot; with &quot;Chuan Shan Jia.&quot;</p>
<p>When taking medicines for loss, one must avoid cold foods. Fish and beef are extremely cold and should be avoided altogether. If one eats beef, the pain will not subside. Also, avoid eating pork from sick pigs or sows; remember this well!</p>
<p>For any loss, one may take herbal medicines, but they must come from a large bone and not a human mortuary. When combining sovereign and ministerial medicines, they should be prepared with warming and blood-qi-tonifying herbs together.</p>
<p>All medicines for loss must be taken hot, as they are capable of generating blood and energy to reconnect bones. Furthermore, one should avoid using fire to roast them.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If external applications are ineffective, internal medicine will also not be effective. When using herbal poultices, it is essential to pick fresh herbs on-site for efficacy. If traveling far and unable to obtain them fresh, they can be ground into powder instead. However, powdered herbs are inferior to fresh ones. If herbal remedies are unavailable, you can use the monarch and minister herbs together in a binding preparation. </p>
<p>For any decoction containing alcohol, it should not matter whether it is red or white, but gray wine must be avoided. Moreover, in cases of severe injury, alcohol should not be administered carelessly, as it may exacerbate swelling and cause abdominal distension; this must be firmly noted! If the condition stabilizes somewhat, then alcohol can be prepared with water or infused in broth.</p>
<p>For injuries affecting the sides, chest, abdomen, or ribs, it is necessary to use herbs that promote circulation, alleviate blood stasis, and clear the heart. Additionally, one must consider the patient&#39;s condition—whether they are weak or strong. For those who are weak, the herbs used for circulation and nourishment should be administered gently, using poultices first and circulation-inducing herbs afterward.</p>
<p>If circulation-promoting herbs do not induce flow, then use herbs that regulate qi afterward. If the abdomen shows no signs of swelling, this indicates that blood is not the issue, but rather qi is blocked. If blood is indeed present in the abdomen, one must quickly address it, integrating qi-regulating herbs as well, ensuring that the chest and abdomen do not become painfully tight.

<p>For small children who fall and hit a corner of a table, simply using ground radish seeds brewed and consumed will aid recovery, as it also helps with qi. </p>
<p>Generally, when applying treatments, avoid using medicinal washes on the head, as this might lead to tetanus; for other areas, you may use cooked oil mixed with medicinal washes to fend off wind and alleviate pain. When treating, start by grinding caowu (a type of herb) with hot wine and take one or two cups before proceeding. If the qi is completely exhausted, use suhexiang pills to revitalize; before revitalizing, brew and consume black beans, fangfeng (siler), licorice, and huanglian (coptis) in cool water, or use coix seeds blended in water. Avoid using salt to resolve issues. If there’s vomiting, add fresh ginger juice.</p>
<p>The above methods are prescriptions specialized for specific cases, noting that every individual has variations in their condition and treatments should not be generalized.

<p>Liu Zonghou stated: Injuries from being struck by a metallic edge arise not from qi movement but from external causes.

Thus, for injuries, the focus is solely on blood. It is essential to distinguish between cases of blood stasis and excessive blood loss. </p>
<p>In cases of impact or falls, if the skin is not broken but there is internal damage, it will certainly involve blood stasis. If a metallic edge injures the skin leading to blood loss, the two conditions should not be treated in the same manner.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, upon examining the injuries, there are differences in severity, depth, and the amount of vital energy and blood circulating in the meridians. It is essential to first expel the stagnant blood, unblock the meridians, harmonize the blood, and alleviate pain. Then, one can adjust the vital energy, nourish the blood, and replenish the stomach energy; all of these will be effective.</p>
<p>Recently, I observed that soldiers in the besieged city who were injured, regardless of whether the severity was in the head, face, hands, feet, chest, or back, were universally treated with powerful laxatives such as rhubarb. When rhubarb became scarce, some even resorted to using castor beans, believing it would help dispel toxins immediately; however, this often led to serious harm later. Even slight injuries to fingers were treated similarly with laxatives. </p>
<p>Little did they know that rhubarb is only suitable for those with stagnant blood; for those who have lost too much blood and whose vital energy and stomach energy are weak, it should not be taken. Castor beans are very heated and toxic; they can only break down hardened masses and eliminate accumulation, making them particularly inappropriate for these ailments. Consequently, after administering laxatives, if the pulse becomes increasingly hard and strong, the physician, failing to recognize this change, mistakenly believes that stagnant blood has not been fully expelled and continues to treat it further, which could lead to the unfortunate loss of life.

There are also cases of internal sores with heat and stagnation, often covered with white scabs, where the wound openings are blocked, making it difficult for the qi to circulate. Thus, when the heat is intense and leads to wind, one must first observe the wound: if it is flat and without discharge, it indicates wind; if yellow fluid comes out from the edges, it indicates dampness; and if there are signs of convulsions, urgent treatment is required. </p>
<p>Dong Yuan says: Tetanus connects the exterior and interior, differentiating between yin and yang, and should be treated in a manner similar to typhoid fever. People understand the need for external treatment but do not recognize the necessity for internal attack and harmonization. If the pulse is floating and weak, it&#39;s linked to the Taiyang (greater yang) stage, so sweating is appropriate. If the pulse is long and strong, it pertains to the Yangming (bright yang) stage, hence purging is advised. If the pulse is floating and thin, it relates to the Shaoyang (lesser yang) stage, which is half in the exterior and half in the interior, requiring harmonization. Understanding these three methods will ensure treatment is aligned with the disease. There has not been a case where one has applied the three yang treatments and failed to address the illness. It is merely stated that these methods are for the three yang and does not involve the three yin, as the wind evil is found in the three yang channels, making early treatment according to the methods beneficial for recovery.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Surgical Authenticity by Chen Shigong of the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falls and Impacts</strong></p>
<p>Falls can be classified into those that have or have not broken the skin, and there are differences between losing blood and suffering from bruising. For instance, if one falls from a height without breaking the skin, there will be bruised blood accumulating within the organs, causing the person to feel dazed and unresponsive, resulting in difficulty with urination. One should use Da Cheng Decoction to promote urination, and the person will regain consciousness. If they remain unresponsive, the Guo Shen Decoction can save them. For ordinary falls, directly using the Revitalizing Blood Decoction is sufficient. If there are injuries to bones and joints, with torn tendons and continuous blood flow, the Sheng San can stop the bleeding. Following that, one should apply the Huai Rui Shi powder externally. For severe cases such as breaks in bones and major tissue damage, specialized methods for setting bones and binding will be needed; details for these procedures are not yet specified.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds from Sharp Instruments</strong></p>
<p>Wounds from sharp instruments, or &quot;golden wounds,&quot; occur when cut by a blade. Some may involve deeper injuries that affect muscles and sinews. If the skin is merely broken, apply Tao Hua Powder to stop the bleeding. If the tendons are severed, mix in Sheng Jin Dao Powder. If bleeding resumes after stopping, it is imperative to apply Yu Hong Ointment directly to the wound, as the ointment promotes healing. If there is a fracture of muscles or bones, the person&#39;s complexion will surely turn yellow; they must avoid wind and cold externally, and avoid cold foods internally to prevent complications. For those who have lost an excessive amount of blood, the Guo Shen Decoction and Ba Zhen Decoction are essential for recovery; there are no alternatives for these cases.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zhang Chuang (Wound from a Cane)</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Chuang refers to the affliction of good flesh being hurt, distinguished by whether it is already burst or not, akin to the difference between punishment and extreme torment. For already burst muscle, apply a cooling and pain-relieving ointment after the cane strike, and the swelling will dissipate. If not burst, and there is internal bruising, use a needle to release the congealed blood internally, followed by taking Da Cheng Decoction, which will facilitate recovery. If the wounded area has rotting and has already begun to pain, apply jade red ointment to it, which will naturally decompose and regenerate, leading to healing. When enduring a situation with humiliation or extreme suffering, it is advisable to preemptively take Iron Cloth Shirt Pill to safeguard one’s body and life.</p>
<p><strong>Bite Wounds</strong></p>
<p>Human bites are a concern, as they injure good flesh. However, teeth belong to the Yangming stomach and are distinct, containing excess organs, and tend to be hot and fiery when produced in the mouth. Ingesting food through biting thoroughly masticated and swallowing, as well as the toxicity from cooked food, all contribute to the injury, resulting in swelling, extraordinary pain, foul pus, and decay that pierces the heart, which indicates the toxicity from the teeth. After a bite, within a day, wash the wound with warm urine to cleanse the yellow bruising from the teeth, then apply to the bite hole a toad fat paste. Cover with a bandage, and as the pus begins to emerge, healing will gradually occur. If this method is not followed and swelling and severe pain arise, wash again with child urine to cleanse it. Use coarse paper dipped in sesame oil, ignite it to create smoke, and let it waft over the swollen painful area until it subsides, to alleviate the tooth toxicity. Also, insert a strip of toad fat into the wound, cover it, and monitor as the swelling decreases, while regularly applying jade red ointment to aid in the healing of the flesh and mouth. If there are additional complications, treat according to those specific symptoms.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tetanus</strong></p>
<p>Tetanus arises from wounds in the flesh, which are subsequently invaded by external wind that gradually penetrates the meridians and moves inward. The external symptoms include alternating cold and heat, clenched jaws, arched back, and foaming at the mouth; if it affects the yin, the body feels cool with spontaneous sweating, and the wound appears flat and sunken as before, as the poison has internalized. </p>
<p>One should use the Universal Elixir to induce sweating and expel the wind pathogen; then apply the Jade True Powder to the affected area, achieving effectiveness once pus is produced. If after sweating the initial symptoms do not recede, the wound remains flat, and there are periods of consciousness and unconsciousness, with intermittent spasms and inability to open the mouth or produce sound, it ultimately leads to death. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Gui Pi Tang</strong> is used to treat injuries from falls and similar conditions where both qi and blood are injured, possibly due to overthinking harming the spleen, resulting in blood deficiency and fire movement, causing insomnia; or there may be pain in the heart and spleen, lethargy and excessive sleepiness, anxiety and palpitations, spontaneous sweating and night sweats, irregular bowel movements, or blood issues. Its efficacy is quite rapid. Ingredients include 2 qian each of ginseng, white atractylodes, angelica, white poria, roasted astragalus, polygala, longan flesh, and fried jujube seeds; and 5 fen each of musk and honey-fried licorice. These are to be decocted with ginger and jujube water. If adding bupleurum and gardenia, it becomes the modified Gui Pi Tang.</p>
<p><strong>Run Chang Wan</strong> treats injuries from falls and similar conditions, or conditions of excess fire in the spleen and stomach leading to dry bowels, or from wind-heat and blood stasis. The ingredients include 1 liang each of sesame seed and peach kernel, peel removed and ground; and 5 qian each of notopterygium, angelica tail, prepared rhubarb, soapberry thorn, and gentian. These are ground into a powder, mixed with honey to form pills the size of tung seeds, especially effective with pig bile pills. Take 30-50 pills at a time, with a bowl of white boiling soup before meals. Weak individuals should first guide with pig bile; if there’s no passage, blood should be replenished.</p>
<p><strong>Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang</strong> treats lesions like ulcerated sores, where blood and qi are damaged, leading to heat in the muscles, great thirst, red eyes, and flushed face, with unceasing symptoms day and night. The pulse is large and weak, with no strength when pressed deeply. This condition often arises from hunger, thirst, and overexertion; if carelessly taking Bai Hu Tang, it could be fatal. Use 1 liang of roasted astragalus and 2 qian of angelica, prepared with wine.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Godly Efficacy Angelica Ointment</p>
<p>It treats sores and poison from injuries caused by sticks, regardless of whether they have already burst or not. If the flesh is injured but not rotten, using this remedy will lead to self-healing. If the flesh is dead and you use it, it will cause the necrotic flesh to decay, allowing new flesh to grow easily. When the flesh gradually turns white, the poison is nearly exhausted, and new tissue forms rapidly. For injuries from sticks where the outer skin is intact but the inner flesh is rotting, the outer skin may dry out and harden due to internal heat, causing painful connections to healthy flesh, hence the common term &quot;boil scab skin.&quot; Pus accumulates with no way to drain, leading to internal swelling and pain, and sometimes it becomes so deep that surgical intervention is needed before it ruptures, creating an opening that is hard to close.</p>
<p>Weak individuals often develop tetanus from such injuries, frequently resulting in severe consequences. If there is stagnant blood within the stick wound, use a sharp magnetic piece to draw out the bad blood at the affected area, and apply this ointment. The boil scab will form naturally, dead flesh will decay, pus will exit, and what bursts will be superficial, allowing new flesh to grow without forming scabs and avoiding the pain of skin peeling, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. </p>
<p>The ingredients, Angelica, Rehmannia, sesame oil, and two types of wax, are primarily for promoting flesh growth, stopping pain, nourishing blood, and reinvigorating tendons, which are all suitable for the flesh. This formula has already been published and is widely used by practitioners.</p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>6 taels of sesame oil</li>
<li>1 tael each of Angelica, yellow wax, and raw Rehmannia</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation: First, fry Angelica and Rehmannia in oil until dark, strain out the residue, melt in the wax, wait for it to cool, and stir evenly until the ointment is formed. White wax is particularly excellent.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the past, when Xu Yuangong entered the capital for the provincial examination, he fell from his horse while crossing a bridge, suffering a dislocation in his right shoulder. Bystanders told his servant: &quot;Quickly put it back in the socket; if blood stains the socket, it will be hard to treat.&quot; The servant followed this advice as Xu was unconscious and unaware of the pain, and they then hired a sedan chair to return to their residence. </p>
<p>Some said that without the horse ridden to record the matter, he could not heal this injury. Urgently calling, he arrived just at dusk, and by candlelight he looked at Xu&#39;s face, which was still treatable. He then applied the medicine to seal the area, and by midnight Xu regained consciousness, and by dawn the pain had stopped. Upon removing the seal, the damaged area had turned white, and the bruising had shifted to the socket. From then on, daily adjustments were made, with the swelling extending to the shoulder and back. The medicine was applied, causing three liters of dark blood to be drawn, and within five days, he returned to normal, thus he was able to attend the examination; this was indeed the method used.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Angelica Blood Supplement Soup treats injuries from sharp blades, as well as bruises and abrasions that lead to excessive blood loss; it is essential to relieve pain while also replenishing.

Decoct raw Rehmannia, mix with a boy&#39;s urine for consumption, and do not use alcohol. For Qi deficiency, add ginseng, white aster, and astragalus.

This has been tested and proven effective. The larva should be returned to its original place without harming it.</p>
<p>For treating strong reactions from gunshot wounds: Combine yellow soybeans and one measure of chicken feces.

After taking, it is advisable to consume hot ginger porridge.</p>
<p>For maggots developing in rotten gunshot wounds: Use alum and sprinkle it on the wound to kill them instantly.</p>

<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When a person falls or suffers a setback, bad blood remains inside, causing abdominal fullness and swelling, making it difficult to move forward or backward. First, administer beneficial medicine. This affects the Jueyin meridian above and the Shaoyin collateral below. Puncture below the inner ankle of the foot, causing blood to flow from the vessels in front of the bone, and puncture the dorsal artery of the foot. If this does not help, puncture each of the three points on the back of the hand until blood is seen. Puncture the left side for issues on the right, and vice versa. For those who are easily saddened, startled, or unhappy, puncture as per the right side.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When there is a fall or setback, bad blood remains inside. If there is great anger, the qi rises without descending, accumulating below the ribs and thus harming the liver. Additionally, a stroke or being hit can occur; for instance, if one is drunk and sweats in the wind, it harms the spleen. Furthermore, headache cannot be treated by meridian points. If struck and there is internal bad blood, and if the pain has not subsided, one can puncture laterally, but not distantly. If the body is injured and there is excessive bleeding due to stroke or cold, if there is a fall, the limbs become weak and slack, termed &#39;body slack.&#39; Treat the area below the navel, three inches below the navel, which corresponds to the Yangming and Taiyin, and this is the Guanyuan point.</p>

<p>The &quot;History of the Yuan&quot; states: Bu Zhier, under the command of Yuan Taizu, was shot multiple times during a campaign against the Hui people, and his body was filled with blood. Taizu ordered a cow to be taken, its abdomen opened, and the wounded individual placed inside to soak in warm blood. After a while, he recovered.</p>
<p>Li Ting, under Bie Yan, was wounded in the left ribs by cannonfire and had an arrow penetrate his chest, nearly resulting in death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; states: During the Xuanhe era, there was a royal physician in a certain kingdom who abruptly received a summons from the emperor to attend to a Buddhist monk. Upon examination, the physician found that the monk had already succumbed to death. When questioned about the cause of death, the attendants were at a loss and terrified. After a long while, two or three elderly attendants arrived, weeping as they approached the sedan chair, and only then did they reveal the truth: he had fallen while chasing after a butterfly, descending from the white sky, which resulted in his death. The physician explained that the injuries were from a fall and belonged to the category of external injuries. He wanted to clarify further but feared uncertainty in the future. Upon another inspection, he noticed a faint breath. Suddenly, he remembered that he had a scented pill in his medicine pouch. He hurriedly took half a tael and heated it over a fire, removing the brain and musk, then ground it with half a liter of wine to administer. By the third watch of the night, the monk finally moaned in agony, and by the fifth watch, he expelled a large quantity of dark blood. After a few days of treatment, he finally recovered.</p>
<p>Cui Jishi was recently serving as a judge with Li Baozhen in Zelu. Li Xiang had been striking a ball with a cue when a general inadvertently struck him with his staff, resulting in an injury to Li&#39;s thumb, which split his nail. In a hurry, he requested a golden knife and medicine to wrap around it, and despite the pain, he forced himself to sit up and repeatedly asked for wine, drinking several cups. As he consumed too much, his complexion turned increasingly pale, yet he bore the pain without complaint. One soldier suggested using freshly cut green onions, which were then heated over sugar and ashes, peeled, and split open to extract the juice. This was applied to the injury, and the warming of the onions was repeated several times. After three applications, his complexion turned red, and soon after he mentioned that the pain had subsided. They repeated this process over ten times, using the heated onions and their juice, and eventually finished the meal in laughter and conversation.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

After a month of futile treatments, he resigned himself to death. The man from Dai first used a mixture of Three Holy Powders to expel the greenish bile and blockage in the throat, using about half a large jar. Next, he administered over a hundred pills of a purging medicine to remove the foul, dry filth, which took up another large jar. Then he decocted a few qian of the Tongsheng Powder to be taken hot, followed by a sour, spicy soup with scallions and vinegar to induce sweating.

He was treated with a mixture of children&#39;s urine wine, and while needling the affected area, much dark blood and rotten flesh were drawn out. Suddenly, he experienced fever and agitation with sweating, followed by taking three doses of a single ginseng decoction which slightly mitigated the symptoms. Additional medications to tonify qi and blood and clear liver fire were administered in several doses, allowing for slight improvement in appetite. Later, he continued alternating doses of the single ginseng decoction, leading to the resolution of all symptoms and increased appetite, but he could not sleep well. He used Guizhi Decoction adding gardenia and bamboo shavings in four doses, promoting sound sleep. Due to mental fatigue, he experienced thirst and spontaneous sweating, with a weak, rapid pulse, so he was given two doses of Donggui Decoction to nourish the blood, bringing him stability. He also took a modified version of the Comprehensive Ginseng Decoction, excluding Chuanxiong and adding wheat, five-flavored herbs, peony, earth bone, ma huang root, and fried floating wheat in several doses until sweating ceased, and the necrotic flesh began to ulcerate.

Years later, whenever the weather was gloomy, they experienced itching and pain, finally realizing the mistake of not being needled.</p>
<p>Another patient had black swelling on the buttock and thigh, but the skin was unbroken. There was heaviness and pain, leading them to believe there was no stagnant blood inside, thinking that only cooling medicine could relieve the pain. On examining their pulse, it was thin and knotty, indicating deep stagnant blood due to their thick flesh. Without needling, it would worsen, risking internal decay and injury to tendons and bones. I needled four inches deep and extracted several liters of black blood, after which the swelling and pain ceased. That day, they experienced fever and chills, thirst, and headaches, due to both Qi and blood deficiency; a restorative tonic was then administered, and they recovered.</p>
<p>Another patient, after being beaten, took herbal preparations including Four Substances, safflower, peach kernel, and rhubarb to disperse stagnant blood, which instead caused abdominal pain.

With the use of medications to promote expulsion, pus began to slightly drain and clear, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi, requiring significant tonification. However, he did not comply. I insisted on using a strong tonifying remedy, and his appetite improved while the dead flesh started to ulcerate. He also experienced little sleep, so I administered Gui Pi Decoction with added gardenia for two doses, allowing him to rest. Due to exertion, he became mentally distressed and thirsty, with a pulse that was floating and rapid, so I gave him two doses of Danggui Buxue Decoction to calm him.</p>
<p>Another patient had endured severe punishment, with outer skin wounds that had ruptured and stagnant blood pouring out. The inner flesh was rotten and swollen, affecting the chest and back and extending to the toes. He was in a state of faintness, not eating. Therefore, I applied hot black sheepskin to the wounded area, and infused him with a mixture of young boy&#39;s urine and thin porridge, further using remedies to clear the liver, invigorate blood, regulate qi, and strengthen the spleen. His spirit slightly revived, and he began to complain of severe pain all over. I then administered a large dose of blood-nourishing and qi-tonifying medicine, resulting in the swelling diminishing and his appetite improving. In the midst of winter, the stagnant blood congealed and could not expel pus, so I employed a strong tonifying remedy to strengthen his yang energy, and when the pus finally matured, it was drained, revealing the bone. I applied Danggui ointment and, after having administered over a hundred doses of previous medicine, his flesh gradually regenerated.</p>
<p>One patient, although the stagnant blood was gone, still had the appearance and qi of normalcy, yet suffered from heat, thirst, pain, and phlegm obstruction in the diaphragm.

It was treated with Four Substances, Bupleurum, and safflower, resulting in immediate relief from pain, though there were symptoms of chills and fever, along with dry mouth and poor appetite. After continuing with Four Substances, white atractylodes, poria, Bupleurum, Scutellaria, and pollen, the chills and fever subsided. Then, Six Gentlemen, ligusticum, angelica, and patchouli were prescribed, which improved the appetite; although the necrotic tissue was discharging, the pus remains clear and watery. Increasing the dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, and poria in over twenty doses led to the dissolution of the necrotic tissue, and the pus became thicker. Under the influence of a laxative taken once, the patient experienced four bouts of diarrhea; the affected area remained dark, but the pulse was not strong or rapid. Thus, ten complete nourishing tonics were administered with increased doses of cinnamon and ophiopogon, leading to the flesh turning red and new flesh gradually forming. It was encouraging that the patient, being young, responded well to treatment; recovery occurred in just over a month. Otherwise, the condition would have been untreatable. </p>
<p>In cases of contusions where there appears to be stagnation of blood, it is essential to remove it, then administer tonics to bolster the vital energy. The reason being that Qi and blood have already been compromised; it is crucial not to use methods that move Qi or promote bleeding again, as this would further damage the spleen and stomach. Consequently, the vital energy would struggle to reach the lower parts, leading to a counterproductive situation. Those who are weak are particularly susceptible to premature demise.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A patient experienced swelling and pain, applying a cooling medicine intending to dissipate the stagnant blood, but this resulted in both buttocks and legs becoming cold, with the blood stagnating and congealing, causing distension and discomfort in the chest and abdomen. I quickly removed the applied medicine, washed the affected area with warm urine wine, and administered a formula of Six Gentlemen, Areca nut, and Angelica. I also applied Returning Yang ointment, which gradually warmed the buttocks and legs. I then adjusted the previous formula by removing Areca nut and adding Chuanxiong, Huo Xiang, and Cinnamon sticks in four doses. The stagnant blood was resolved, and I proceeded to perform acupuncture. Furthermore, I nourished the spleen and stomach to support the circulation of qi and blood for healing. It is said that when qi and blood are warmed, they flow; when cold, they congeal. Extreme cold generates heat, transforming into pus, which can lead to deep and extensive decay. Once the blood and qi are compromised, the muscle tissue cannot regenerate, making recovery exceedingly difficult.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

A decoction was prepared with children&#39;s urine combined with four substances, peach kernels, safflower, chihu, Huangqin, wheat shell, and flower powder, and upon taking it, there was a rapid improvement. The application of black sheepskin on the affected area was very beneficial; later, a large amount of pus and blood was drawn out, and the patient was in a faint condition, with slight movement of the lips and mouth, tightly clenched teeth, and dark coloration in the affected area. It was considered to possibly apply tetanus remedies; however, I stated that this was a case of deficiency of both qi and blood leading to transformation of the condition. </p>
<p>I prescribed ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and white atractylodes, along with a decoction of ginseng and human milk, which restored the original qi and healed the various symptoms; then, I continued to administer the Ten Great Supplements Decoction for regulation and stabilization. If there is internal accumulation of pus and blood, acupuncture should be applied. If the patient experiences lockjaw and involuntary urination after an ulceration, resembling tetanus and indicating extreme deficiency of qi and blood, strong tonics must be urgently used. If one has a longstanding phlegm and wind condition, the focus should be on clearing phlegm and reducing fire. If wind is triggered by anger, it is important to clear the liver and reduce fire. If the patient experiences these symptoms due to carelessness in sexual activity, it signifies deficiency of kidney water and excessive heart fire, requiring primary nourishment of yin and tonification of qi and blood.

However, due to mental strain, his hands became shaky, his eyes opened, and he sweated profusely, leading him to consider using medicines to expel wind.

He experienced pain, cold, and fever, and external treatments with Da Huang and other medicines, along with internal administration of heat-clearing and toxin-eliminating remedies, led to no pain and no abscess, but the symptoms worsened.

So, I applied Yulong ointment to disperse the cold and additionally prescribed Liu Junzi decoction to strengthen the spleen and stomach. After a few days, there was slight pain at the affected area, and the swelling gradually diminished, indicating the movement of Yang energy to the area, eventually leading to the discharge of thick pus.

<p><strong>From the book &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Whenever encountering any poisonous creatures or stings, one must not develop a revulsion towards them or kill them. If one rashly kills them, later one will surely suffer from the poison of the sting, and treatment will be difficult. Be cautious, be cautious!</p>
<p><strong>Rabies</strong></p>
<p>In late spring and early summer, when dogs frequently go mad, one must admonish the weak and small to carry a stick for protection. If one tries to prevent an attack and fails, it will not exceed the remedy of moxibustion. Among a hundred days, if there is not a single day missed, then one may escape disaster. If, upon first encountering a wound, it seems to heal without pain, and one thinks it has recovered, this is the most terrifying sign. Great calamity will arise, and death will come unexpectedly. Whenever a rabid dog bites someone, it causes that person to become mad as well; their spirit has already become detached, how can one be aware? Just watch closely; if during moxibustion the fire is applied for one degree, and the heart feels distinctly awake and clear, then one realizes that once bitten, one is indeed mad, thus it is imperative to understand this deeply. This illness is severe, yet many in the world treat it lightly and do not regard it seriously, which leads to deaths occurring regularly. When I first learned medicine, I did not take it up professionally; there were those who encountered this ailment but when they consulted me, I genuinely did not know how to respond, resulting in several patients dying under my care.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

It became evident that there are no good doctors in the world, and those who die wrongfully are many; this is not an exaggeration. Therefore, future learners should not stop at this method. I believe all medical prescriptions must be contemplated deeply, attentively studied, and earnestly learned to gain thorough understanding. One should not think that knowing one or two methods is sufficient; that would be a great self-deception.</p>
<p>Whenever a dog bites a person, symptoms should appear within seven days; if they do not appear after twenty-one days, then the person is in the clear but should still be cautious for over a hundred days. Every seven days, one should drink one to two sheng of leek juice, and one should avoid eating dog meat and silkworm pupae for life; consuming these will provoke the disease, leading to inevitable death. While the wound is not healed, one should refrain from eating raw fish and all rich, cold foods; it is fine to eat steamed fish with rice, but not from rich dishes. Drinking alcohol should be avoided, ideally for over a year.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Qusheng (a type of insect)</strong></p>
<p>Whenever the shadow of the Qusheng urinates on someone, it causes diseases and sores. Its symptoms include sudden sharp pains in the body, akin to a thorn prick or the sting of an insect, followed by the emergence of small bumps that appear like the seeds of a berry, with red edges and a center filled with white pus resembling millet, causing intense pain to the flesh. The body experiences severe chills and high fever, with serious cases affecting the waist, sides, and chest. </p>
<p>The treatment method, upon first noticing the illness, is to grind rhino horn and apply it to stop the poison, treating it as one would with fire elixirs. During the Wude period in June, I contracted this ailment. After five to six days, I felt unsettled and my condition did not improve with other treatments. Someone else advised me to draw the shape of the Qusheng on the ground and carefully remove the soil from its abdomen with a knife, mixing it with saliva to make a paste and applying it. After reapplying, I was cured. This illustrates the interconnectedness of all things in the world, though the reasons remain unknown.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Jiangnan, there is a type of poisonous insect known as the short fox or the tian. This insect resembles a beetle. According to &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; it is pitch black, shaped like a large flying insect, with a long horn extending from its mouth, resembling the yoke of a crossbow. At the end of this horn, it curves like a bent bow, using air as an arrow to attack people based on the water&#39;s force. Sometimes, people hear it making a noise in the water and must fully submerge its mouth in water to attack. It is afraid of geese, which can eat it.</p>
<p>Initially, when symptoms appear, there are chills and shivering, with alternating hot and cold sensations, resembling a cold or being struck down. The person may be unable to speak, feeling slightly better in the morning but worsening in the evening, suffering from chaotic chills and heat. These are the symptoms. If not treated promptly within three to four days, those infected easily succumb by the seventh day. At first, there are no sores, but only the chills and shivering. Eventually, sores form that resemble a mix of weevil and urine, similar to boils and sores. There are three types of sores caused by this insect: one is dark black like a dye, with surrounding skin entirely red, which might feel prickly as if pierced by thorns; another type develops into a sore that persists for a long time, accompanied by intermittent chills and fever; the third type appears as if burned with fire and is the most urgent, killing within several days.</p>
<p>Whenever one encounters toxic insects in mountainous waters, those wading through might be affected like a shooting victim without a weapon. The diagnostic method involves initial chills, mild headache, pain around the eyes, inner agitation, shaking of the limbs, tightness in the waist and back, and pain in the knees. They may also experience alternating feelings of heat and cold, with an overwhelming desire to sleep, waking up with severe symptoms in the evening, and cold extremities.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In two or three days, worms develop in the abdomen, feeding on the lower parts of the body, leading to sores in the anus that are painless and itchless, causing the person to remain unaware. If not treated urgently, after six or seven days, pus will emerge from the lower parts, the worms will start to eat the organs, and intense heat and toxins will lead to uncontrollable diarrhea. After eight or nine days, even skilled doctors will be unable to treat it. When recognized, one must examine the lower parts urgently; if there are sores that are bright red as if cut meat, this indicates Yang poison and is most urgent; if the sores resemble fish teeth, this indicates Yin poison and can be treated with less urgency. Both can be deadly, but not exceeding twenty days. To determine whether it is water poison or not, one should prepare five to six liters of broth, adding five liters of crushed garlic into the broth, ensuring it does not get too hot, and then straining it for bathing. If the body exhibits red spots due to the water poison, this confirms it; otherwise, it must be treated for another ailment.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the streams and sources of Jiangdong and Jiangnan, there is a worm known as the Short Fox Worm, also called the Shooting Worker. This worm is blind but has keen hearing; found in mountain springs and streams, it can detect human voices and shoots poison from its mouth, hence the name Shooting Worker. For those affected by this small, mildly toxic worm, when pursued, and if the worm hits a person&#39;s shadow, it does not immediately cause sores. Instead, symptoms appear first with chills and fever; the body dislikes the cold, physical strength may seem tense, headaches and eye pain occur, and there may be a constant cough with labored breathing. In the morning, there may be brief recovery, only to return to chills and fever in the evenings. Sometimes, when afflicted with cold damage, a person may feel as if struck by a corpse, becoming unable to speak, and the symptoms persist in this manner. Those unfamiliar with the local landscape, who do not frequently wander in mountain waters, may mistake these signs for cold damage from external forces, leading to improper treatments. As the poison intensifies and sores develop, it may further be mistaken for swellings; to the extent that nausea and vomiting of blood occurs, they might even fear it to be sorcery or poison, resulting in serious troubles. Now, this description delineates its characteristics to clarify its symptoms from those of cold damage.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Injury from Poisonous Insects and Snakes</strong></p>
<p>For injuries caused by poisonous insects and snakes, chew white atractylodes finely and apply it to the wound, and also take it mixed with alcohol. For centipede injuries, apply chicken droppings. For worm injuries, use the burnt ash of fern leaves mixed with fragrant oil for application. For dog bites, use ground tiger bone. For cat bites, apply mint. For bee and scorpion stings, chew ginseng and apply it, or use ground crab shells, burnt to retain their essence, mixed with honey for application. In all cases of injury from vicious creatures, it is also good to quickly cauterize the wound with moxa a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</strong> 【Ming Dynasty - Xue Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Accidental Swallowing of Leeches</strong></p>
<p>To treat the accidental swallowing of leeches, consuming honey can lead to recovery. If live leeches are thrown into honey, they will dissolve into liquid, as repeatedly observed. One book states that leeches found in wells can be eliminated by throwing in white horse bones, which has also been tested successfully. Leeches, or bloodsuckers, even if dead and ground to powder, can come back to life upon contact with water. Their ingestion can be quite harmful, and the aforementioned treatment has always been effective.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Snake Enters the Seven Orifices</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a snake enters the seven orifices, split the snake&#39;s tail and insert several grains of Sichuan pepper, sealing it with paper. The snake will exit on its own. Then brew and drink ginseng broth; alternatively, consume wine and garlic to combat internal toxins. If bitten by a snake, eat garlic and drink wine; also use crushed garlic to apply to the wound and combine it with moxa for cauterization; the poison will be naturally resolved. This applies to all cases of venomous insect bites.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Caterpillar Injury</strong></p>
<p>In spring and summer months, beneath trees and in the gaps, there exists a type of striped caterpillar, which is extremely toxic. If a person makes contact, its hairs penetrate into the skin and flesh, reaching the bones. Initially, there may be slight itching on the skin, which gradually turns into pain; after several days, the external itching persists while internal pain develops. Scratching can worsen the condition, potentially leading to rotting flesh and a threat to life. This is known as the poison of the penetrating worker, and no medications are effective. </p>
<p>Use about a bowl of good fermented soybeans and half a cup of clear oil, mix and mash the soybeans, and apply a thick layer to the painful and itchy areas. After some time, the bean scent will reach the bones and draw out the caterpillar hairs, which will be visible. After removing the soybeans, bury them in the ground. Boil fragrant white angelica soup to wash the painful areas. If the flesh has already rotted, use crushed cuttlefish bone or fishbone as a powder to apply, and it will heal. For injuries from insects, licorice works wonders. Chew finely and apply it to the mouth for immediate relief. In present-day Suzhou, beneath Tiger Hill, local families depend on planting trees, and there are no insects within a ten-mile radius, likely due to the use of licorice juice to sprinkle on the trees.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a></p></div>

Use only the rice as powder, mix with a little cold water and clear oil, and take it on an empty stomach; shortly after, take another dose if needed for alleviating poison. If there’s no effect, repeat. If it causes stomach pain after relief, urgently mix with cold water and blue indigo to counteract the poison, otherwise, it may cause harm.

Do not scratch; instead, water it with cold water and apply a little salt, which will prevent it from becoming a sore.</p>
<p><strong>Insect Bite Treatment:</strong> Apply oil made from purple root. Another method is to mix ghee with blood and apply it.</p>
<p><strong>Caterpillar Poison Treatment:</strong> Take the white juice from dandelion roots and stems to apply directly, and healing will be immediate. Another method: use finely ground yellow earth from the bottom of a pot, knead it with vinegar into a ball, and rub it on the itchy painful area. The hairs will come off, and pain and itching will cease immediately, proving remarkably effective.</p>
<p>During summer, there are variably colored caterpillars that are extremely toxic, causing sores and intense pain; the flesh may rot. Use one bowl of fermented soybeans and half a cup of clear oil, mash together and apply thickly to the affected area overnight. The next day, check for caterpillars in the soybean mixture and bury them in the ground. Wash the area with a white ginger decoction, then apply ground fish bones, and healing will occur.</p>
<p><strong>Fumigation to Remove Lice:</strong> Lay down nightshade leaves on a mat, and by the next day, fleas and lice will be completely dead. Nightshade, also known as the black nightshade or old crow’s eye grass.</p>
<p><strong>Fumigation to Remove Lice:</strong> Grind hundred-leaf herb and gentian into a powder, place it in a bamboo container, and burn to create smoke which will cause the lice to fall off; it can also be used to wash clothing in soup.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: Generally, when spring and summer first intersect, dogs frequently become rabid. If you see a dog with its tail held straight down and not curled, and it has drool and a black tongue, that is a rabid dog. If bitten, it is a serious condition with a survival rate of only one in nine. Urgently use a needle to draw blood, wash it clean with human urine, fill half of the peach pit shell with human excrement, cover the wound with it, and apply moxibustion. When the shell is charred and the excrement is dry, it can be removed. Apply moxibustion until achieving a hundred strong burns; the next day do another hundred, continuing to three to five hundred robust burns until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>For those bitten by a rabid dog, perform moxibustion directly on the bite mark, three times a day, until completing one hundred and twenty burns before stopping. Regular consumption of leeks prevents recurrence.</p>
<p>For bites from wild dogs, before the bad blood is fully expelled, perform moxibustion one hundred times, and then one burn each day thereafter. If blood does not come out, prick to draw the blood; stop moxibustion after one hundred days. Abstain from alcohol and meat from pigs and dogs.</p>
<p>For bites from numerous snakes, apply moxibustion three to seven times.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a></p></div>

A visiting monk cleaned the wound with fresh water several times, and upon discovering white tendons exposed, he mixed a small amount of white angelica powder, human gall, and musk into it. As a result, foul water began to drain out, and this process was repeated daily, eventually leading to recovery after a month.</p>
<p>In the case notes of Xue Ji, it states: Chen Yi, a resident of Juyong Pass, was stung on the hand by a scorpion, causing excruciating pain that radiated to his side, chills and heat, and severe headache and nausea.

Despite applying the Flying Dragon Life Snatching Pills to the affected area and taking pain relief medications, he saw no effect. Eventually, by using the garlic moxibustion method, he was cured.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Zhang Jian was once a judge in the Jian Nan region under Zhang Ting Shang. Suddenly, he was bitten on the neck by a spotted spider. By the next morning, the bite area had developed two red lines, thick and thin like chopsticks, wrapping around from the top of his head down to his chest, reaching the heart. By the second day, his face and head were swollen and painful, nearly reaching a size comparable to a bowl. His abdomen also began to swell, bringing him to the brink of death. Zhang valued the recommendation highly, so he allocated five hundred thousand from his family’s wealth and likewise requested five hundred thousand from his family to find a healer. Suddenly, a person responded, claiming to be able to treat him. At first, Zhang did not believe him much and wanted to test his methods, so he ordered the preparation of the medicine in front of him. The man said he wouldn&#39;t spare any formula as he was treating a person’s life. He then took a large bowl of indigo juice and added the spider into it, leaving it for a long time until it emerged, very weak and unable to move. He then ground the indigo juice again and mixed it with musk and realgar, adding another spider into the mixture, which immediately turned into liquid. Zhang and the others were very surprised, and they applied it to the bite area. Within two days, he was completely healed, but the bite site had turned into small sores, with scabs falling off as usual.</p>
<p>There was also a case where a person was poisoned by a snake and had lost consciousness. An old monk gave him a two-qian dose mixed with wine to drink, and he regained consciousness. He then used the residue from the medicine to apply to the affected area, and after a while, he again administered a two-qian dose, which alleviated all the bitterness. Upon questioning, it was revealed that the ingredients were one ounce of five-spirit resin and half an ounce of realgar, ground into powder; that was all there was. Later, those who were poisoned used it, and it proved effective on all occasions.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p></div>

Blood is retained beneath the ribs, causing shortness of breath. *(Note: The liver governs blood and color; when the pulse is strong but color is not visible, it indicates blood is stored below. The condition arises from falls or injuries caused by impacts, leading to blood clotted under the ribs, hence the shortness of breath.)* **Jinkui Yaolüe** *(Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)* **On the Pulse Signs of Severe Wounds** The pulse at the inch is slightly floating and weak; it indicates loss of blood, similar to sweating. If there is no sweating, the body has wounds caused by knives or axes, resulting in loss of blood. **Pulse Classics** *(Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe)* **On the Pulse** If one falls from a height and has internal bleeding, with abdominal distension, a firm pulse indicates survival; a weak pulse indicates death. If the bleeding from a severe wound is excessive, a weak and fine pulse suggests survival, while a strong and frequent pulse indicates death. If there is bleeding from a severe wound and the pulse is small and deep, survival is more likely; if it is floating and strong, death is likely. If a cut causes bleeding of one or two sheng (a unit of weight), a strong pulse indicates death within twenty days. For continuous bleeding from cuts, a strong and frequent pulse indicates death within seven days; a smooth and fine pulse indicates survival."},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"**Thousand Gold Formula - Sun Simiao** **For Treating Injuries from Blows** Whenever one is injured from a blow, if blood stagnates and the heart feels compressed, making it impossible to speak, one can pry open the mouth and let urine run into it to induce revival. Similarly, for those who have fallen from a carriage or horse, or have been crushed under wheels and appear dead, one should place the deceased comfortably and cover the mouth, nose, and eyes with a sleeve for a brief moment. After a short while, they may live again, opening their eyes and producing warm urine. **For Treating Metal Wounds** To treat metal wounds, regardless of size or season, as soon as the injury occurs and blood flows, one should apply a thick layer of lime to stop the pain and promote quick healing. If lime is unavailable, ash may be used instead. If the wound is very deep and should not heal quickly, add a bit of talcum powder to prevent closure. Generally, when metal wounds bleed, the person will feel thirsty and should endure it. Eating dry foods or fatty foods to quench the thirst is advised, while avoiding salty foods. If one consumes too much porridge or gruel, it can cause blood to flow excessively and be lethal. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid anger, loud talking, laughter, speculation on yin and yang, physical labor, excessive consumption of sour or salty foods, hot alcohol, and other similar things. Even after the wound heals, these precautions should be observed for at least a hundred days to half a year before returning to normal activities. **Hexi Six Writings - Liu Wansuo**"},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"**On Tetanus** Wind diseases are the beginning of all ailments. When the body is clear and calm, the pores are closed and protected; thus, even when faced with harsh winds and poisons, they cannot cause harm. Hence, tetanus aligns with both the exterior and interior, differentiating between yin and yang, and is treated similarly to typhoid. In humble villages, there are often those who lack knowledge. They only recognize external manifestations and are unaware of conditions that affect the interior or require harmonization. This includes the methods of sweating, purging, and harmonizing, which also align with typhoid symptoms. There are those with conditions on the surface, those within, and those in between. For internal issues, purging is appropriate; for surface conditions, sweating is suitable; and for those in between, harmonization is best. However, sweating and purging must not exceed their limits. Thus, tetanus arises from outside to inside, with more severe internal symptoms indicating a more serious illness. Consequently, injuries from sudden trauma, alongside wind attacks, propagate through the meridians, causing alternating chills and fever, leading to a tightened body and an inability to open the mouth. In severe cases, malign energy enters the organs, necessitating purgative treatment. No sores heal, the vitality is weak, and the flesh does not regenerate; the openings of sores do not close properly, allowing wind pathogens to enter from the outside, resulting in tetanus-like symptoms, hence no sores heal. Alas! The world commonly claims that moxibustion is supreme, but fails to realize that heat from fire and toxic influences disrupt the meridians, leading to countless variations. Mild cases may cause fever, while severe cases can induce wind and spasms, or lead to bent limbs and inability to open the mouth or misaligned eyes, all due to the stagnation of energy and vitality from the sores, preventing proper circulation. There are also cases of tetanus without moxibustion treatment. When a sore has white scabs, the opening closes up, making it difficult for energy to flow and drain; thus, yang heat easily becomes stagnant, and excessive heat can give rise to wind."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"Therefore, a floating pulse that is weak indicates the Taiyang (greater yang), a long and strong pulse indicates the Yangming (bright yang), and a floating and thin pulse indicates the Shaoyang (lesser yang). For Taiyang, sweating is appropriate; for Yangming, purging is suitable; and for Shaoyang, harmonizing is the way. If one understands these three methods, and treats without matching the illness, it has never been the case. For tetanus, when wind-heat is severe and there is stagnation at the surface, but the interior Qi remains balanced, there may be good extension of pulses, with tendons and pulses tight; sometimes there can be a feeling of cold or spasms, with floating, rapid, and thin pulses. In such cases, it is advisable to use warming and spicy herbs to treat the wind, releasing the blockage and achieving recovery. This is akin to treating a surface heat and stagnation of wind-cold with Ma Huang Decoction for warming and dispersing. In general, when using warming and spicy herbs to open wind-heat stagnation, it is beneficial to assist with cooling herbs to avoid causing illness with the medicinal herbs and worsening the wind-heat condition."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"For treating febrile diseases, herbs such as ephedra, cinnamon twig, huangqin (scutellaria), zhi mu (anemarrhena), and gypsum may be used. If only licorice, talc, green onions, and fermented soybeans are used, they can effectively disperse cold. If the exterior symptoms persist and gradually progress inward, with a slight, wiry pulse indicating that the interior is not yet severely disturbed, one should use herbs to dispel wind-heat and alleviate the stagnant cold, or slightly add dispersing, pungent, and warming herbs. This is akin to using Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) to harmonize when the condition is half exterior and half interior. If the interior condition is severe, with a stiff tongue, locked jaws, backward-arching neck and back, restlessness, spasms, thick and sticky saliva, a feeling of fullness in the chest and abdomen, constipation, or intermittent sweating, with a pulse that is deep, forceful, rapid, and wiry, this indicates that the sweat is caused by wind-heat severely affecting the interior, and the exterior heat has somewhat subsided. Consequently, the pores are open and heart fire is intense, leading to sweating. The treatment principle should involve dispelling wind and relieving the cold blockage, and then applying herbs to dispel wind-heat and alleviate stagnation, allowing the heat to recede, the blockage to disperse, and restoring health."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"### Essentials of Living: On Falling Injuries When one falls from a height, bad blood accumulates internally and affects the twelve meridians. Physicians often diagnose this as a wind-attack on the liver meridian, with symptoms manifesting in the lower ribs. Blood is primarily governed by the liver, and bad blood will inevitably return to the liver, regardless of which meridian is affected, as the liver is the master of blood. If there is severe pain, it will likely cause sweating. However, since everyone sweats, this is associated with wind disorders, all of which belong to the liver wood. Moreover, with stagnant blood congealed, it counteracts its proper place and enters the liver. In cases of falling from a height, the upward-acting blood and qi are disturbed; this is attributed to the liver. If there is no sweating, it may not be a cold injury, but once there is sweating, it must be influenced by wind, thus requiring treatment with blood-dispersing herbs. In situations involving fall from a height or blunt force trauma, where there is accumulated stagnant blood in the chest and abdomen, it is essential to differentiate between the upper, middle, and lower jiao (organs). For the upper region, use formulas like Lao Xijiao Di Huang Decoction. For the middle, use Taoren Chengqi Decoction. For the lower area, something like Didao Decoction can be prescribed. Additionally, these can be combined with urines or wine for decoction. There are also methods that include raw Rehmannia and Angelica in the decoctions, or those that combine with Da Huang. Individuals with deficiency who cannot withstand purgation may take Siwu Decoction with added pangolin for effective treatment. There's also Huasui Shi San, which can be prepared with a boy’s urine or taken with wine.

For injuries below the diaphragm, one should first restore connection and then eliminate the stagnant blood; for those above, it is advisable to drink juice from leeks or consume it mixed with porridge.

Those who are dizzy and mentally disturbed from falls and struggles can take Su He Xiang pills mixed with wine, or Jing Ming powder, or a Qi Harmonizing drink with a bit of rhubarb boiled and mixed with vinegar; or use children’s urine to mix with the black spirit powder (or substitute it with liquor boiled with sandalwood). For pain from falls and struggles, mixing wine with amber powder is excellent. Additionally, use Wu Yao to regulate Qi, especially effective for back pain due to falls. If individuals who have fallen take medicine and use inhalation and topical applications without effect, advise them to use equal parts of white peony, red peony, Wei Ling Xian, frankincense, and myrrh, grind them to fine powder, mix with wine and take; this will immediately relieve half of the pain. **Knife Wounds** For knife wounds with uncontrollable bleeding, use only white peony powder mixed with white wine, and apply the powder directly to the wound. If the blood is not flowing freely and is causing stagnation with redness and swelling at the wound, or affecting limbs and head, consider using Jing Ming powder or boiling safflower mixed with black spirit powder. If there is difficult-to-stop bleeding, use dragon bone and frankincense in equal parts, ground to powder and pressed into the affected area; using snake fish grass as a poultice is especially effective.

When the body is clear and pure, the pores are closed, and even strong winds or toxic influences cannot cause harm. However, concerning tetanus, injuries that break the skin and flesh are often regarded as ordinary matters. Little do people realize that the wind pathogen takes advantage of this vulnerability to invade, gradually turning into a severe condition. If sores do not heal properly, the wind pathogen can also invade from within. Whether through bathing in decoctions or cauterizing with moxa, the toxic gas from these methods is not different from the tetanus pathogen. The symptoms can spread through the meridians, burning the vital energy; hence, alternating cold and heat occurs. In severe cases, the jaw may lock, eyes may become misaligned, and the body becomes rigid, resembling a bow drawn tight, leading to death in a short time, which is indeed pitiable. The method of treatment should align with that of typhoid fever since there are three differing conditions: on the surface, internally, or a combination of both. Therefore, treatment involves sweating for surface conditions, purging for internal conditions, and harmonizing for cases in between. Moreover, one should not exceed these methods.

If circulation-promoting herbs do not induce flow, then use herbs that regulate qi afterward. If the abdomen shows no signs of swelling, this indicates that blood is not the issue, but rather qi is blocked.

Recently, I observed that soldiers in the besieged city who were injured, regardless of whether the severity was in the head, face, hands, feet, chest, or back, were universally treated with powerful laxatives such as rhubarb.

Even slight injuries to fingers were treated similarly with laxatives. Little did they know that rhubarb is only suitable for those with stagnant blood; for those who have lost too much blood and whose vital energy and stomach energy are weak, it should not be taken. Castor beans are very heated and toxic; they can only break down hardened masses and eliminate accumulation, making them particularly inappropriate for these ailments.

There are also cases of internal sores with heat and stagnation, often covered with white scabs, where the wound openings are blocked, making it difficult for the qi to circulate. Thus, when the heat is intense and leads to wind, one must first observe the wound: if it is flat and without discharge, it indicates wind; if yellow fluid comes out from the edges, it indicates dampness; and if there are signs of convulsions, urgent treatment is required.

If the flesh is injured but not rotten, using this remedy will lead to self-healing. If the flesh is dead and you use it, it will cause the necrotic flesh to decay, allowing new flesh to grow easily. When the flesh gradually turns white, the poison is nearly exhausted, and new tissue forms rapidly. For injuries from sticks where the outer skin is intact but the inner flesh is rotting, the outer skin may dry out and harden due to internal heat, causing painful connections to healthy flesh, hence the common term \"boil scab skin.\" Pus accumulates with no way to drain, leading to internal swelling and pain, and sometimes it becomes so deep that surgical intervention is needed before it ruptures, creating an opening that is hard to close. Weak individuals often develop tetanus from such injuries, frequently resulting in severe consequences. If there is stagnant blood within the stick wound, use a sharp magnetic piece to draw out the bad blood at the affected area, and apply this ointment.

I used needles to extract over three bowls of foul pus, and he exhibited all signs of deficiency. A strong tonic was administered, and after over two months he regained some ability to walk. However, due to mental strain, his hands became shaky, his eyes opened, and he sweated profusely, leading him to consider using medicines to expel wind. I said: This indicates that his qi and blood are still insufficient. Hence, I urgently warmed and frequently pressed his navel and the Qi Hai point with moxibustion. I decocted four taels of Ren Shen and five qian of Fu Zi for administration. After a while, there was slight movement in the arm; another dose was given, and he could open his eyes and speak, though his breath could not stabilize. I then combined Ren Shen, Qi, Gui, and Zhu, totaling one pound, with five qian of Fu Zi, decocted in water, and he took it gradually.

Be cautious, be cautious! **Rabies** In late spring and early summer, when dogs frequently go mad, one must admonish the weak and small to carry a stick for protection. If one tries to prevent an attack and fails, it will not exceed the remedy of moxibustion. Among a hundred days, if there is not a single day missed, then one may escape disaster. If, upon first encountering a wound, it seems to heal without pain, and one thinks it has recovered, this is the most terrifying sign. Great calamity will arise, and death will come unexpectedly.

This illness is severe, yet many in the world treat it lightly and do not regard it seriously, which leads to deaths occurring regularly.

At the end of this horn, it curves like a bent bow, using air as an arrow to attack people based on the water's force. Sometimes, people hear it making a noise in the water and must fully submerge its mouth in water to attack. It is afraid of geese, which can eat it. Initially, when symptoms appear, there are chills and shivering, with alternating hot and cold sensations, resembling a cold or being struck down. The person may be unable to speak, feeling slightly better in the morning but worsening in the evening, suffering from chaotic chills and heat. These are the symptoms. If not treated promptly within three to four days, those infected easily succumb by the seventh day. At first, there are no sores, but only the chills and shivering. Eventually, sores form that resemble a mix of weevil and urine, similar to boils and sores. There are three types of sores caused by this insect: one is dark black like a dye, with surrounding skin entirely red, which might feel prickly as if pierced by thorns; another type develops into a sore that persists for a long time, accompanied by intermittent chills and fever; the third type appears as if burned with fire and is the most urgent, killing within several days.

Initially, there may be slight itching on the skin, which gradually turns into pain; after several days, the external itching persists while internal pain develops. Scratching can worsen the condition, potentially leading to rotting flesh and a threat to life. This is known as the poison of the penetrating worker, and no medications are effective. Use about a bowl of good fermented soybeans and half a cup of clear oil, mix and mash the soybeans, and apply a thick layer to the painful and itchy areas. After some time, the bean scent will reach the bones and draw out the caterpillar hairs, which will be visible. After removing the soybeans, bury them in the ground. Boil fragrant white angelica soup to wash the painful areas. If the flesh has already rotted, use crushed cuttlefish bone or fishbone as a powder to apply, and it will heal.

Another method: Moxibustion on the wound five to seven times."},{"anchor":"trans-217p","marker":"217p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" states: When one is bitten by various insects or snakes, applying moxa to the affected area several times is very effective. For a snakebite, take a whole garlic clove, cut it into three pieces, press it against the bite site, and apply moxa on top, allowing the garlic's essence to penetrate and promote healing. If bitten by a poisonous snake, one should place snake skin on the bite area and use moxa to draw out the venom. In a medical case record from \"Yijian Zhi\", it is said that a person in Linchuan was bitten by a viper and immediately fell unconscious, with one arm swelling to the size of a thigh. After a while, the entire body showed yellow-black swelling. A person took freshly drawn water, mixed it with one pound of fragrant white angelica powder, and administered it; the patient felt a bubbling sensation in the stomach, followed by yellow fluid coming out of the mouth, with a foul odor that was hard to endure. After a long while, the body shrank back to its original state. It is also mentioned that using a mixture of wheat kernel soup is particularly effective, alongside applying the powder on the skin."},{"anchor":"trans-218p","marker":"218p","type":"translation","text":"At Jing Mountain Temple, a monk was bitten by a snake, resulting in a severely rotten foot that did not heal despite various treatments. A visiting monk cleaned the wound with fresh water several times, and upon discovering white tendons exposed, he mixed a small amount of white angelica powder, human gall, and musk into it. As a result, foul water began to drain out, and this process was repeated daily, eventually leading to recovery after a month. In the case notes of Xue Ji, it states: Chen Yi, a resident of Juyong Pass, was stung on the hand by a scorpion, causing excruciating pain that radiated to his side, chills and heat, and severe headache and nausea. This was a result of the conflict between the pathogenic and the normal energies. Despite applying the Flying Dragon Life Snatching Pills to the affected area and taking pain relief medications, he saw no effect. Eventually, by using the garlic moxibustion method, he was cured. My mother and I have also been stung before, and using the same method, the pain ceased immediately. My mother also once had her finger injured by a centipede, and using the same method, she recovered. For injuries caused by snake venom, treating them this way has proven effective. The \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" mentions that garlic can treat wound toxins and has the ability to restore life, which is indeed true! A hunter suffered a severe bite on his leg from a wolf, and treatment with frankincense pain relief powder was ineffective. I reasoned that in such a Yin condition, qi and blood had congealed, making it difficult for medicine to penetrate. I instructed him to undergo garlic moxibustion over fifty times, after which the pain completely subsided. I then applied tonifying medications and plasters for further healing. Wang Sheng was bitten on the leg by a dog, and shortly thereafter experienced sharp pain radiating to his thigh. The next day his jaw was tight and urgent, and treatment with the Jade True Powder showed no effect. Again, after undergoing garlic moxibustion for over thirty times, he recovered, and then he used Jade True Powder and tonifying disinfectant medications, leading to complete healing."},{"anchor":"trans-219p","marker":"219p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Medical Essentials\" states: Zhang Jian was once a judge in the Jian Nan region under Zhang Ting Shang. Suddenly, he was bitten on the neck by a spotted spider. By the next morning, the bite area had developed two red lines, thick and thin like chopsticks, wrapping around from the top of his head down to his chest, reaching the heart. By the second day, his face and head were swollen and painful, nearly reaching a size comparable to a bowl. His abdomen also began to swell, bringing him to the brink of death. Zhang valued the recommendation highly, so he allocated five hundred thousand from his family’s wealth and likewise requested five hundred thousand from his family to find a healer. Suddenly, a person responded, claiming to be able to treat him. At first, Zhang did not believe him much and wanted to test his methods, so he ordered the preparation of the medicine in front of him. The man said he wouldn't spare any formula as he was treating a person’s life. He then took a large bowl of indigo juice and added the spider into it, leaving it for a long time until it emerged, very weak and unable to move. He then ground the indigo juice again and mixed it with musk and realgar, adding another spider into the mixture, which immediately turned into liquid. Zhang and the others were very surprised, and they applied it to the bite area. Within two days, he was completely healed, but the bite site had turned into small sores, with scabs falling off as usual. There was also a case where a person was poisoned by a snake and had lost consciousness. An old monk gave him a two-qian dose mixed with wine to drink, and he regained consciousness. He then used the residue from the medicine to apply to the affected area, and after a while, he again administered a two-qian dose, which alleviated all the bitterness. Upon questioning, it was revealed that the ingredients were one ounce of five-spirit resin and half an ounce of realgar, ground into powder; that was all there was. Later, those who were poisoned used it, and it proved effective on all occasions."},{"anchor":"orig-1p","marker":"1p","type":"original","text":"古今图书集成医部全录卷三百七十七 外科跌打金刃竹木破伤门 黄帝素问 脉要精微论
