<p>Outer Medicine: Wind, Dan Poison, and Rashes</p>
<p>Huangdi&#39;s Plain Questions</p>
<p>On the True Essentials and Great Discussions</p>
<p>When the lesser yang governs the heavens and the guests triumph, the Dan Zhen (rashes) emerge externally and become Dan Chou (red eruptions). [Note: Dan Zhen refers to rashes which arise from heat, while Dan Chou refers to red eruptions that emerge externally but desire to move inward.]</p>
<p>Thousand Gold Prescriptions (by Sun Simiao of the Tang Dynasty)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Erythema</h3>
<p>Erythema, also known as &quot;heavenly fire,&quot; appears as a sudden red coloration in the flesh resembling vermilion. The larger patches can be as big as a palm, while in severe cases, it can cover the entire body. It may be itchy and swollen, with an unpredictable hue. There exists a condition called &quot;blood vermilion,&quot; originally termed &quot;white vermilion,&quot; according to &quot;Qianjin&quot; Volume 22, which describes swelling in the flesh that is itchy with abdominal pain, slightly swollen as if blown up, resembling a rash. There is also &quot;cockscomb erythema,&quot; which is red and raised, with larger patches like coins and smaller ones like millet grains, presenting a texture on the skin resembling a chicken’s comb, and is also called &quot;cornel erythema.&quot; &quot;Watery erythema&quot; arises due to generalized body heat, and when it comes into contact with water, it forms yellow-red spots resembling bubbles, often found in skin regions like the thighs and groin. Although this may seem like a minor ailment, if left untreated, it can lead to death.</p>
<h3>Urticaria</h3>
<p>According to &quot;Su Wen,&quot; when wind evils invade the skin, it results in the skin becoming weak and the true Qi dispersing, further affected by cold, causing an opening of the pores and hair follicles, leading to chaotic movement of excess Qi, which results in itchiness. Thus, both wind rash and itchiness are caused by this. There are also red rashes that suddenly appear as if bitten by mosquitoes, causing severe itchiness, and in exacerbated cases, they become hugely raised, resulting in further scratching. There are also white rashes exhibiting similar characteristics. Red rashes appear with heat and subside with cold, while white rashes emerge in cool, overcast weather. For white rashes, it is advisable to wipe them with boiled alum juice or to bathe in water mixed with a bit of wine. Alternatively, wiping with boiled heather juice is also beneficial. Treatment for others should be similar to that of erythema. Commonly referred to as &quot;wind droppings,&quot; it is also known as &quot;wind corpse.&quot;<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Book of Sores and Ulcers - by Song Dynasty&#39;s Dou Hanqing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dan Poison</strong></p>
<p>The internal poison (Dan) appears as redness and swelling from beneath the ribs to the lower back, and it is known as internal poison. If noticed early, it can be treated; however, once it reaches the waist, treatment is no longer possible. This illness often results in difficulty urinating and defecating, and it can lead to a rapid spread of a dark, blue-black coloration across the body, resulting in death within three days. For urgent treatment, apply medicinal powders directly to the affected areas and take Lianqiao Baidu Powder.</p>
<p>The external poison (You Dan) is characterized by widespread red poison across the body. Initially, it manifests as bluish discoloration in both hands, with swelling throughout. If it goes untreated for a night or two, the swelling can spread throughout the body; if it enters the heart, it leads to death. At the first sign, urgent treatment is necessary, which includes taking Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction and Mu Xiang Liuqi Drink, along with the application of Jin Guo Powder. It is advisable to treat it using methods similar to those for carbuncles.</p>
<p>Children suffering from red wandering fire poison often acquire heat in the womb from their mothers, which leads to symptoms appearing on the skin in a migratory manner.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If the illness originates from the abdomen and moves outward to the limbs, it is considered light; if it originates from the limbs and returns to the abdomen, it is heavy, and urgent treatment will be necessary for survival. The children&#39;s condition, known as &quot;red fire toxin,&quot; arises from accumulated heat, which is termed &quot;fetal poison.&quot; This can occur if the mother during pregnancy consumes spicy and toxic foods, bathes in hot water, or uses charcoal in winter, allowing heat to enter the fetus, along with excessive cravings. Some children may be born wearing warm clothing or sleeping on heated bedding, leading to inner and outer heat toxins attacking the body—most will show symptoms within about six months. Initially, the body will feel hot; if observed with light, it will appear red. If the child cries uncontrollably and has an unstable appearance, those showing symptoms in the limbs are likely to survive, while those with symptoms in the waist and abdomen are unlikely to survive.</p>
<p>Immediate action must be taken: use a sharp container to remove the purple blood, allowing the toxic blood to flow downward—do not reverse the procedure. Apply powdered frankincense mixed with egg white to the affected area, and periodically apply juice from banana roots. Internally, administer a detoxifying pill made from vermilion mixed with honey, and follow it with a decoction made from &quot;purple gold&quot; preparation.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>There are also ten types of Dan poison: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Feizao Dan, which causes swelling that begins at the top of the head, progressively becoming red and swollen, with the neck also swelling and the eyes turning red. Take a bundle of fresh scallions, crush them to extract the juice, and apply it. Alternatively, mix five qian of (Shibu) nitrate with two qian of realgar powder, and blend with juice from banana plant roots. Use a discarded brush to apply this juice. The patient should lie down so that the juice can flow from the bottom to the top, allowing the poison to exit through the Baihui point. If applied from the bottom upward, it can cause the toxin to invade the throat, which is difficult to treat. The same treatment applies to adults suffering from this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jizao Dan, which causes swelling and pain in the forehead, can be treated by applying a mixture of red adzuki bean powder and egg whites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Guihuo Dan causes red swelling on the face. For this, use powdered liver of a snake (Fulonggans) mixed with egg whites, and then apply banana root juice. Ground motherwort ash mixed with vinegar can also be applied, and this method is effective.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tianhuo Dan begins as red spots on the back; for this condition, use mulberry bark powder mixed with sheep fat for application.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Heavenly Zao Dan: Red swelling arises from the arm, yellow in color. Burn willow branches to make ash, then mix with honey for application.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Water Dan: Bulging from both sides, use fresh iron filings, or needle sand, or rusty nail powder mixed with pig dung for application.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Hu Ci Dan: Yellow swelling originates from the navel; use areca nut powder mixed with rice vinegar for application.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Wildfire Dan: Red swelling starts from both feet; use frankincense powder mixed with mutton fat for application.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Smoke Fire Dan: Red and white spots arise from both feet; use earth from beneath a pigsty mixed with sesame oil for application.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Hu Lou Dan: Yellow swelling occurs in the groin; use earth from a leaking roof mixed with mutton fat for application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The kidney qi is affected by wind poison in the calves, affecting the bladder meridian. Cold qi harms the kidneys, which in turn damages the bladder; this is wind poison. One should use perilla leaf infusion and areca nut pills.  </p>
<p>Flying poison arises from the heat experienced by the muscles, leading to red swelling that moves unpredictably. Wash the affected area with warm water, and use a three-edged needle to prick the poison 20 to 30 times, or use a magnetic acupuncture tool, which is also effective. Afterwards, apply a toxin-drawing powder and take the internal detoxifying soup for relief.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Ming Theory (Jin Cheng Wuju)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Dan Poison: Difficulty and Ease</strong></p>
<p>If the Dan poison arises internally and manifests as limbs, it is easy to cure; if it originates in the limbs and enters the abdomen, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Hejian Six Writings (Jin Liu Wansu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gold Thread Sores</strong></p>
<p>Also known as Red Thread Sores, they resemble threads or ropes, varying in size. It is said that Dan poison is involved, but it is not as widespread as smoke poison. When this condition occurs on the head, if it descends to the heart, it leads to death; conversely, if it arises from below to the top, the same fate applies. One can cut at the sore&#39;s head, lightly prick to induce bleeding, then chew duckweed root and apply it for relief.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Active Principles (Yuan Zhang Jiemu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spots Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The disease of rashes has varying symptoms. If the sores are inflamed and swollen externally, they belong to the Shaoyang San Jiao&#39;s fire, known as spots; if small red dots are present beneath the skin and do not surface, they belong to the Shaoyin Jun&#39;s fire, termed rashes. For visible spot symptoms, if there is vomiting or diarrhea, one should be cautious not to treat erratically, as this indicates the evil energy is being expelled both upwards and downwards. Generally, both sores and rashes should not be purged, for fear of causing changes through reckless actions—this is referred to as Shaoyang opening the exterior, thus it is advisable to harmonize first, then slightly induce. To harmonize and detoxify, one must calm the five organs, for which Fang Feng Decoction is effective. If there is no loose stool, one requires slightly inducing medicines; many such formulas exist in Qian&#39;s prescriptions, select as needed. If constipation is present, mild laxatives should be utilized; Dang Gui Pills and Jujube-Sliced Baixiang Pills are appropriate.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Upon first recognizing the rash, if it appears all together, it is difficult for infants to endure; thus, other symptoms may arise. The head and tail should not be purged; the head refers to the upper body, and the tail refers to the lower body. If one can induce vomiting or purging, it is especially inadvisable to purge downward, as it is better to stabilize the interior. If there is no vomiting or diarrhea, first administer stabilizing medicine for three to five doses. If the child has an appetite but suffers from constipation and internal excess, it is advisable to promote smooth bowel movement. If there is internal deficiency resulting in diarrhea, interior medicine should be used, ending with a dose to gently stimulate. Generally, there is much medicine for stabilizing the interior and little for dispersing pathogenic factors; if there is constipation, one should gently relieve it to avoid blockage of pathogenic energy, allowing it to alternate and making it easier for the child to endure. If the body is warm, treatment should proceed smoothly; if the body is cool, treatment should be reversed. In both cases, it is beneficial to take more doses of wind-dispelling decoction to help stabilize the interior. If there is significant constipation but the child can eat, consider using angelica pills to gently alleviate it.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method (by Zhu Zhenheng of the Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Certification of Wind-Heat</strong></p>
<p>Wind-heat, accompanied by phlegm, arises from within and manifests externally. The method for this is found in Tongsheng Powder, which should be used for mild sweating; it must not be purged. For internal injuries leading to rashes, there is severe vacuity of stomach qi, with fire circulating outward. It is advisable to nourish and descend, as suggested in “Essentials for Yin Syndromes.” If the rash resembles that of typhoid, it signifies the disease of phlegm-heat manifesting externally; mild sweating is the remedy, and purging would be inappropriate. </p>
<p>As for rashes related to heat and phlegm in the lungs, clearing lung fire and descending phlegm may be effective, with sweating also being an option, though purging is applicable in certain cases. Rashes are akin to sores; sweating can lead to recovery, as indicated in Tongsheng Powder.</p>
<p>Pruritic rashes often pertain to the spleen, subtly present between the skin layers, hence they are called pruritic rashes. When they develop, they may often be itchy or numb, indicating a combination of wind and warmth. Rashes appearing red indicate accompanying transformation of heat. Cucumber water can pacify the &quot;Dragon Liver&quot; and eliminate red dots and spots. </p>
<p>Dai Yun notes: &quot;A rash is comprised of colored spots without heads.&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Rashes that appear as small raised bumps should be treated immediately upon their emergence, as they may reappear after being treated, unlike spots that do not have a raised head. The diseases related to these rashes vary. If sores develop with swelling externally, they belong to the less yang category of the Sanjiao and are called spots; small red rashes that are internal and do not emerge belong to the less yin category of the governing fire and are called rashes.</p>
<p>For febrile diseases, there are four types of spots that can appear. Among them, the spots from warm toxins are the most severe. Bright red spots indicate heat in the stomach, while purplish-black spots indicate stomach decay. The treatment timing may differ, either early or late, and these are caused by externally contracted febrile diseases. Medications such as Yuan Shen, Sheng Ma, and Bai Hu can be prescribed.</p>
<p>For yin-representing spots, they may also appear on the back and chest and can show up on the hands and feet; they are usually few and faintly red. If treated as a heat condition, the use of cooling medicines would be a significant mistake. This condition arises from a fire without a root, which gathers in the chest, affecting the lungs and manifesting as spots on the skin. These spots resemble those from mosquitoes or lice, rather than elaborate patterns. It is best to regulate the middle, warm the stomach, and use seasonings like fennel and peony, or employ methods similar to Da Jian Zhong. Allowing the fire to descend will help the spots retreat, thus addressing the root of the problem rather than merely the symptoms.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fadan (Red Rash)</strong></p>
<p>The colors and conditions of Fadan vary; the itchiness and pain also differ. Generally, this arises from blood heat, weak muscles, and wind evils attacking the body. Those with a red color are more common, hence they are referred to as Dan. It is advisable to dispel wind and scatter it by grinding the seeds of burnt sweet gum into a powder and taking it with wine. If the rash appears and is white, it is called Lengmo (Cold Rash), and it is best to dispel wind and scatter it using a blend of black shen powder mixed with wine. This ailment usually stems from loose muscles being attacked by wind evils. Wind heat results in redness, and wind cold results in paleness. This is what people today refer to as red being Dan and white being Mo. Therefore, using wine to combine with Tujv (earth red pigment) leads to healing, as the spleen governs the muscles, and earth can nourish the spleen, aligning with its nature. The ancient method was called Yinzhen (a type of rash), which recognizes not only cold and heat but also includes the four Qi (vital energies). Recent discussions refer to the white type as Polmo (white rash) and the red type as Xuefeng (blood wind). Both red and white conditions can utilize Wuyao Shunqi San (a herbal remedy for wind and gas), taken with wine. For those with a white condition, use Shunqi San more often, while those with a red condition should use Xiaofeng San more frequently. Those suffering from this should also use the decoction of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San. Some people should never eat chicken or animals like deer that might provoke wind; if they do, the rash appears, indicating a connection to spleen wind. The spleen governs all the muscles in the body, and Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San is a medicine for treating the spleen, while Tujv also acts in support of the spleen’s function. This prescription has repeatedly proven effective.<br><strong>[Medical Introduction]<br>[Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan]</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Rash and Wind</strong></p>
<p>Rashes belong to the fire without roots in the Three Heaters; the rashes relate to the fire of the heart, both affecting the lungs. External causes initially present with headaches, high fever, and a change in taste; avoiding excessive sweating and purging is advisable. It is best to lightly relieve muscle tension and induce mild sweating; if there is self-induced vomiting or diarrhea, it is considered cured. </p>
<p>For internal causes, if there is slight headache but the palms are hot and the spleen and stomach are weak, one should fortify to reduce the fire; for those with strong bodies, clearing the lungs to transform the flesh is advisable. If there are color marks without raised spots, especially red like brocade in patches on the chest and abdomen, the harms are due to misinterpreted cold damage or excessive purging of heart fire causing complex ailments, primarily a combination of wind-heat with phlegm. The fire of the lesser yang emerges from within. </p>
<p>Treatment should focus on soothing internal medication with less emphasis on releasing exterior conditions. For those with external infections, Bai Du San added with Zi Cao, or Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang with Yuan Shen. For sore throats, use Yuan Shen Sheng Ma Tang. For madness or bleeding, use Yang Du Sheng Ma Tang. For thirst, use Hua Ban Tang. If there is constipation, use Fang Feng Tong Sheng San with slight effectiveness, avoiding the use of Nao Huang. For body aches, add Cang Zhu and Qiang Huo. For phlegm coughs, add Ban Xia. If heat is severe, consider Hei Nu Wan. For deep rashes, use He Gao. </p>
<p>For internal injuries causing spots that resemble mosquito bite marks, often found on hands and feet, if there is no initial headache or fever, it indicates weak stomach fire spilling outward. It is advisable to use Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Tang or Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang. If internal phlegm heat attacks the head and face, it’s recommended to employ Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang with Yuan Shen, Bei Mu, Huang Qin, Sheng Di, and Mai Men Dong. </p>
<p>For internal injuries accompanied by external infections, use Tiao Zhong Shu Xie Tang or Shen Su Yin.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Rashes may have heads like small grains, or resemble the slight redness of mosquito bites, or appear and disappear unpredictably, sometimes fading only to reappear, with faint red patches on the skin that itch without swelling or pain; this is called &quot;prurigo,&quot; which occurs in spring and is most severe during a debilitating cold, as well as with warm toxins. Treat it with a decoction of Siberian ginseng and Kudzu root, adding burdock seeds, Schizonepeta, and Siler. </p>
<p>Red rashes are caused by heat and dryness from the weather; they diminish when slightly cool, and can be treated with Chuanxiong Cha Tiao San, Ginseng Qianghuo San, or Sesame powder. For internal heat, use detoxifying soup.</p>
<p>White rashes arise from cold weather; they disappear with slight warmth and can be treated with Xingsheng San. For internal deficiency, use the Regulating Middle Decoction.</p>
<p>Rashes that are red or white with a hint of yellow, hidden between muscles and making the limbs feel heavy, indicate dampness carried by wind. They often occur after bathing when one is exposed to the wind, or from sweating and removing clothing. In such cases, a wind-dispelling powder is recommended.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>In cold conditions, use Osmanthus; in hot conditions, use Scutellaria and Bupleurum; in damp conditions, use Atractylodes and Poria. If there is numbness in the limbs, use the Coptis and Tangerine Peel Decoction. For widespread rashes causing extreme pain, use the Bitter Soap Pill. If there are rashes with spots appearing together, do not generally use wind medications, for fear they may lead to phlegm, cough, thirst, nausea, or rashes.  </p>
<p>For purple-red rashes on the face, as well as small spotted rashes, all belong to this category. Rashes that are red are also called Dan rashes, or may appear in five colors, due to an excess of heat and poison in the blood, becoming disturbed by wind poison, leading to a fiery outbreak over the body; in severe cases, the skin can break down. In cold months, use Chuanxiong and Pueraria Decoction; in hot months, use Ginseng and Notopterygium Powder. For heat, add Scutellaria and Ophiopogon; for cold, add Astragalus and Angelica. Refer to the external treatments for children with Zhuan powder and floating duckweed decoction.  </p>
<p>In general, red rashes with warmth and spreading from the chest and abdomen to the limbs indicate good fortune; black rashes with coolness, spreading from the limbs into the abdomen, indicate death. Previously, itching and Dan rashes were categorically divided, but now they are combined, as their treatments are the same.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Red and White Wind</strong></p>
<p>Red and white wind is associated with deficiency of spleen and lung qi, with open pores unable to withstand wind-heat. This can occur due to cold blocking the pores, with internal heat stagnating; or due to yin deficiency leading to fire movement and external pathogens taking advantage; or due to liver fire and wind-heat. Treatment methods: for wind-heat, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Fang Feng and Lian Qiao; for blood heat, use Si Wu Decoction with added Chai Hu, Shan Zhi Zi, and Dan Pi; for combatting wind-heat, use Jing Fang Bai Du San; for internal heat and external cold, use modified Qiang Huo San; for weak stomach qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Qiang Huo and Fang Feng, along with Xiao Feng San; for blood deficiency, use modified Xiao Yao San and Liu Wei Wan. If there is liver and kidney deficiency heat, Liu Wei Wan will self-regulate fire, stabilize wind, and alleviate itching. However, if pungent heat dispelling agents are used, liver blood will become drier, wind and fire will intensify, original qi will further deplete, pores will remain open, wind will invade internally, kidney qi will be harmed, fire will converge, and blood will transform with fire, leading to a more difficult-to-treat condition.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Du (Erysipelas)</strong></p>
<p>In the case of erysipelas in children, if the entire body turns red and is not treated with needling, the toxic energy can enter the abdomen and become untreatable. This condition is caused by poisonous hot blood accumulating in the vital gate, triggered by fire. If it appears as red spots, the bad blood must be needled out to bring forth good blood. If it swells and is red, moving unpredictably, first apply raw sesame oil to the affected area and needle it to release the poison. As for cases that originate from the limbs and enter the abdomen, they should not be treated. Though there are several types of dan and various methods of treatment, needling remains the most effective approach. I have observed that cases that are somewhat severe, when not treated with needling, cannot be saved.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Rash</strong></p>
<p>For a floating pulse, the treatment should focus on dispelling wind. If the pulse is floating and rapid, the approach should be to expel wind and clear heat. If the pulse is deep and rapid, the main treatment should be to drain fire. If the rapid pulse feels firm upon pressure, the method involves relieving exterior symptoms and attacking internal issues.<br><strong>(From &quot;Orthodox Practice in External Medicine&quot; by Chen Shigong, Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Fire poison arises from excessive heart fire and the wind-heat of the triple burner, which manifests on the surface of the skin. It may present differently in terms of dryness and wetness, as well as variations in color. In dry cases, the color is red, resembling cloud fragments, with wind blisters that itch and feel hot. This pertains to the fire of the heart and liver meridians, treated by cooling the heart and draining the liver, using the &quot;Transforming Rash Detoxifying Decoction.&quot; In wet cases, the color is more yellowish-white, with varying sizes that ooze and cause pain. This relates to the damp-heat of the spleen and lung meridians, warranting treatment to clear the lungs, drain the spleen, and eliminate dampness, using the &quot;Wei Ling Decoction.&quot; If the rash arises in the lower back and flanks, it is due to excessive liver fire, known as “waist wrap fire poison,” treated with &quot;Chai Hu Qing Gan Decoction,&quot; with external application of cypress leaf powder or &quot;Ruyi Jinhuang San.&quot;<br>The rash can be triggered by toxins encountered before birth, manifesting after birth.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The body in the womb relies on the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood for nourishment. If the parents cannot restrain their desires, and the passion turns rampant, the fetus will inevitably be affected. Additionally, if they do not avoid rich flavors and are exposed to smoke and heat from cooking, or if they are bundled in heavy blankets, the fetus often suffers from overheating, which can be passed on to the child. After birth, if the baby is washed with hot water and the clothes are exposed to heat, internal toxins can be triggered, leading to the baby feeling heat first, crying out in alarm, and experiencing swelling; this can manifest as redness and heat that moves unpredictably, often starting from the forehead, known as &quot;Tian Zhao Dan,&quot; treatable with Shengma and Geggen decoctions for both mother and child. If symptoms arise from the abdomen and back, they are lighter; those starting from the limbs and affecting the chest and abdomen are heavier. The key is to first treat the bad blood. After treating the blood, slices of fresh pig meat should be applied to the affected area, routinely replaced with a golden powder mixed with water and banana juice, preferably changed twice daily. Internally, use drinks like Dalianqiao decoction, Xieduoxiang decoction, and Wufu detoxifying pills. If toxins cause the abdomen to swell and harden, leading to an inability to nurse, Zixue powder can be administered. After three days, the body gradually cools down, the treated areas become soft and active, sounds are clear, the abdomen softens, and nursing returns to normal. Conversely, if these symptoms do not resolve, it indicates a setback.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Bumps and Rashes</strong></p>
<p>The condition of bumps and rashes, though already well-documented in standard texts, generally refers to children&#39;s measles. However, in cases where adults or children suddenly develop bumps or rashes that are not measles, while similar, there are indeed slight differences that must be distinguished for proper treatment. This is often caused by external wind-heat. </p>
<p>The treatment method: if the pulse is floating and there is a fever with exterior symptoms, the primary focus should be on dispersing the wind pathogen. If the pulse is floating and rapid, clear the heat while expelling wind; if the pulse is deep and slippery without exterior symptoms, focus on clearing fire. If the pulse is both floating and deep, slippery and rapid with symptoms present both internally and externally, it is advisable to treat both the exterior and interior simultaneously. </p>
<p>Moreover, this condition is more commonly seen in children, and one must assess their internal and external state of deficiency and excess to determine treatment. Overall, since children are fragile, more nourishing medicines should be used while less aggressive methods are preferable. If symptoms are secretive, mild dispersal is appropriate; if they are constricted, gentle guidance is appropriate. The aim is to ensure that the pathogenic qi does not stagnate but disperses easily, allowing the condition to be lighter and more stable. In general, warmth in the body indicates a beneficial direction, while coolness suggests a harmful one.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Formula</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A middle-aged man developed a carbuncle that ruptured, experiencing fever, dry vomiting, and a red rash on his back. Various topical treatments and bloodletting on the carbuncle were applied, but the rash did not subside. Additionally, using half C, Chen, and ginger combined with tonics for vomiting was ineffective. Therefore, a decoction of half an ounce of ginseng, and half a coin each of angelica and atractylodes was prepared. After one application, the vomiting ceased; with two or three applications, the rash gradually eased and the fever decreased. After about fifty applications, the fever was finally eliminated, and vital energy began to recover.</p>
<p>Another case involved a man named Bao Yun, aged fifty, who suffered severe itching from wind rashes, mild abdominal pain, and difficulty in swallowing, with slight swelling of the face and body. The symptoms persisted for five to six days, and his pulse was large and slippery, with the right pulse being floating and large, while the left was floating and thin. A formula consisting of fried scutellaria, fried platycodon, angelica, ligusticum, peony, earth, tangerine peel, licorice, sticky millet, and purple vine, each one coin, and half a coin of asarum and astragalus was used. After five or six applications, the condition stabilized.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case Studies&quot; reports: A woman suffered from itchy rashes with a floating pulse, treated with four doses of Xiao Feng San and recovered. </p>
<p>Another woman had itchy rashes with a floating and rapid pulse; she was prescribed two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San and improved slightly, followed by four doses of Xiao Feng San, resulting in stability.</p>
<p>A man presented with red and purple rash, severe pain, fever, and a preference for coolness; the pulse was deep and solid. One dose of Feng Feng Tong Sheng San led to immediate reduction of symptoms, followed by four doses of Jing Feng Bai Du San with added scutellaria and platycodon, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A woman suffering from rashes with itching and pain, alongside constipation, had a deep and solid pulse. She was treated with Si Wu Tang, augmented with scutellaria, platycodon, rhubarb, and sophora flower, which led to her recovery.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>An elderly man suffered from a rash that was slightly red and caused itching and fever. After taking two doses of a ginseng-based formula to dispel pathogens, he saw slight improvement, and was fully cured after taking a modified Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Huangqin and Shanzhizi.</p>
<p>A young child experienced a rash accompanied by pain, fever, and thirst. He wanted to take a cooling drink, but upon checking his pulse, it was found to be weak, indicating that the pathogen was in the meridians and could not be purged. Therefore, two doses of a detoxifying and wind-dispelling decoction were used, resulting in recovery. This condition often affects children, requiring careful examination to determine whether the illness is on the surface or deeper, as well as the severity of the pathogen for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>A man developed red spots all over his body, resembling a rash, every autumn and winter. This was caused by cold air constricting the pores, preventing the rising of yang qi, resulting in internal stagnation. Remedying this situation required a ginseng-based formula to dispel the exterior pathogenic factor, followed by a Baizhong Yiqi Decoction to bolster energy and firm the exterior. He mistakenly believed it was a hot toxin and self-medicated with cooling herbs, which exacerbated his condition. He later sought treatment again, receiving Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Fuling, Banxia, and Qianghuo in four doses, followed by more doses of the same decoction, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man developed lumps during autumn, a sign of deficiency in vital energy with external invasion. He initially took two doses of a nine-flavor Qianghuo Decoction, followed by Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Qianghuo and Fangfeng, resulting in recovery. Later, he was careless with his daily routine, experiencing night sweats, afternoon fevers, dry mouth, phlegm in the throat, and fatigue with reluctance to speak. This was treated with Baizhong Yiqi Decoction and modified Eight Flavor Pill, which led to his recovery.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a condition known as red and white wandering wind, with severe itching and afternoon fever. I prescribed herbs to clear the liver and nourish the blood. Distrustful, she took a major leprosy remedy, which caused arm pain and muscle spasms. Following this, she took herbs designed to resolve phlegm and regulate qi, but her limbs became weak, leading to her demise.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>A woman had a rash like toxic poison that she scratched open, leading to a profuse discharge of pus, experiencing thirst and headache, which worsened in the evening; she was cured with a modified Xiao Yao San.<br>A woman suffered from a previous condition, repeatedly using herbal remedies for wind, resulting in abdominal distention and ultimately death.<br>A girl had a redness like sunset clouds, accompanied by itching and fever; she was cured with a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding raw Rehmannia, Forsythia, and Paeonia.<br>A man suffered from toxic poison, experiencing burning pain and constipation, with a rapid and strong pulse; he took Feng Feng Tong Sheng San, but it did not work. Needling the affected area to remove the bad blood and then using the previous remedy led to recovery.<br>A child had a leg affected by a rash like clouds, which moved unpredictably; first, sesame oil was applied to the area, bad blood was needled out, the poison then dispersed, and after administering honeysuckle powder, the child was stable.<br>Another child had a mild external appearance but suffered from internal constipation; this condition was related to the organs, treated with Dalian Qiao Drink and God’s Efficacy Powder, resulting in recovery.<br>One child had redness all over; needling was done, and detoxifying medicine was administered, leading to immediate recovery.<br>Another child also had widespread redness but was not treated with needling, resulting in the poison gas entering the abdomen, leading to fatality. This condition was due to toxic hot blood accumulating in the life gate, stirred by fire; rashes should be needled to remove bad blood for improvement. For swellings appearing red and moving unpredictably, it is crucial to first apply raw sesame oil to the affected area and needle it to release the poison. The best method is indeed through needling.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《素问》云：风邪客于肌中则肌虚，真气发散，又被寒搏皮肤，外发腠理，开毫毛，淫气妄行，则为痒也。所以风疹瘙痒，皆由于此。又有赤疹者，忽起如蚊蚋啄，烦痒，剧者重沓垄起，搔之逐手起，又有白疹者亦如此。赤疹，热时即发，冷即止。白疹，天阴冷即发。白疹宜煮矾石汁拭之，或煮蒴藋和少酒以浴之，良。或煮石楠汁拭之，良。余一切如治丹方法。俗呼为风屎，亦名风尸。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　　　疮疡全书 【宋窦汉卿】</p>

<p>　　　　　发丹</p>
<p>　　发丹色状不一，痒痛亦异，大概皆因血热肌虚风邪所搏而发。然色赤者多，以赤故谓之丹，宜消风散，入烧枫树子存性为末，酒调服，有发而色白者，谓之冷瘼，宜消风散，杂黑神散酒调。此病多缘肌肉疏，为风邪所袭而成，风热则赤，风冷则白，此今人呼赤为丹，白为瘼。所以用酒调土朱服之而愈者，亦以脾主肌肉，土能入脾，各从其类。古方一名为瘾疹，非特分寒热，亦兼备四气。近世方论呼白为婆瘼，赤为血风。赤白二证，并可用乌药顺气散和消风散，酒调服。白者多用顺气散，赤者多用消风散。病此者，俱宜用煎藿香正气散。有人一生不可食鸡肉及獐鱼动风等物，才食则丹随发，以此见得系是脾风。脾主一身之肌肉，藿香正气散乃治脾之药，而土朱亦入脾之药，此方屡试应验。<br>　　　　医学入门 【明李梴】<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>

<p>　　斑属三焦无根之火，疹属心火，其上侵于肺则一也。外因初起头疼，身大热，口知味者，忌大汗下，宜解肌微汗，有自吐泻者即愈。内因头或微疼，但手心热脾胃虚者，宜大补以降其火；体壮者，宜清肺以化其肌。有色痕而无头粒，重者红如锦绣成片，多发在胸腹，伤寒误温误下，心火所生杂病，全是风热挟痰，手少阳相火，自里发外，治宜安里药多，发表药少。　　外感者，败毒散加紫草，或升麻葛根汤加元参。咽痛者，元参升麻汤。狂言或见血者，阳毒升麻汤。渴者，化斑汤。便闭者，防风通圣散微利之，便不甚闭去硝黄。身疼加苍朮、羌活。痰嗽加半夏。热甚者，黑奴丸。斑烂者，黑膏。　　内伤发斑，轻如蚊迹疹子者，多在手足，初起无头疼身热，乃胃虚火游于外，宜调中益气汤、黄芪建中汤。内伤痰热上攻头面者，升麻葛根汤加元参、贝母、黄芩、生地、麦门冬。　　内伤挟外感者，调中疏邪汤、参苏饮。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　疹有头粒，或如粟米，或如蚊虫咬迹微红，或随出随没，或没而又出，红靥隐隐皮肤表分，欲出不出，但作瘙痒，全无肿痛，名曰瘾疹，当春发，在伤寒最重，即温毒也，升麻葛根汤加牛蒡子、荆芥、防风，或鼠粘汤。　　赤疹，因天热燥气乘之，稍凉则消，川芎茶调散、人参羌活散、胡麻散；里热者，解毒汤。　　白疹，因天寒冷气折之，稍暖则消，惺惺散；里虚者理中汤。　　似赤似白微黄，隐于肌肉之间，四肢重着，此风热挟湿也，多因浴后感风，与汗出解衣而得，宜消风散。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>寒加官桂，暑加黄芩、柴胡，湿加苍朮、茯苓。如肢体不仁者，黄连橘皮汤。遍身疹多痛极者，古苦皂丸。又有斑疹并出者，不可概用风药，恐变痰嗽渴呕疮疹。　　面生紫赤瘾疹，及雀子斑汗斑，皆此类之缓者。　　疹色赤者，又名丹疹，或遍五色，因血盛热毒，畜于命门，被风毒逐动相火，则发满遍身，甚则肌烂，寒月升麻葛根汤，暑月人参羌活散。热加黄芩、元参，冷加黄芪、白芷，详小儿门外治土朱散、浮萍汤。　　凡斑疹赤色身暖，自胸腹散四肢者吉；黑色身凉，自四肢入腹者死。旧分瘾疹丹疹各类，今合一，以其因治同也。<br>　　　　薛氏医案 【明薛己】<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p>

<p>　　赤白游风，属脾肺气虚，腠理不密，风热相搏；或寒闭腠理，内热怫郁；或阴虚火动，外邪所乘；或肝火风热。治法：风热，小柴胡汤加防风、连翘；血热，四物汤加柴胡、山栀、丹皮；风热相搏，荆防败毒散；内热外寒，加味羌活散；胃气虚弱，补中益气汤加羌活、防风，及消风散，血虚加味逍遥散、六味丸。若肝肾虚热，六味丸，则火自息，风自定，痒自止。若用祛风辛热之剂，则肝血愈燥，风火愈炽，元气愈虚，腠理不闭，风客内淫，肾气受伤，相火翕合，血随火化，反为难治矣。<br>　　　　　丹毒</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Erythema</h3>
<p>Erythema, also known as &quot;heavenly fire,&quot; appears as a sudden red coloration in the flesh resembling vermilion. The larger patches can be as big as a palm, while in severe cases, it can cover the entire body. It may be itchy and swollen, with an unpredictable hue. There exists a condition called &quot;blood vermilion,&quot; originally termed &quot;white vermilion,&quot; according to &quot;Qianjin&quot; Volume 22, which describes swelling in the flesh that is itchy with abdominal pain, slightly swollen as if blown up, resembling a rash. There is also &quot;cockscomb erythema,&quot; which is red and raised, with larger patches like coins and smaller ones like millet grains, presenting a texture on the skin resembling a chicken’s comb, and is also called &quot;cornel erythema.&quot; &quot;Watery erythema&quot; arises due to generalized body heat, and when it comes into contact with water, it forms yellow-red spots resembling bubbles, often found in skin regions like the thighs and groin. Although this may seem like a minor ailment, if left untreated, it can lead to death.</p>
<h3>Urticaria</h3>
<p>According to &quot;Su Wen,&quot; when wind evils invade the skin, it results in the skin becoming weak and the true Qi dispersing, further affected by cold, causing an opening of the pores and hair follicles, leading to chaotic movement of excess Qi, which results in itchiness. Thus, both wind rash and itchiness are caused by this. There are also red rashes that suddenly appear as if bitten by mosquitoes, causing severe itchiness, and in exacerbated cases, they become hugely raised, resulting in further scratching. There are also white rashes exhibiting similar characteristics. Red rashes appear with heat and subside with cold, while white rashes emerge in cool, overcast weather. For white rashes, it is advisable to wipe them with boiled alum juice or to bathe in water mixed with a bit of wine. Alternatively, wiping with boiled heather juice is also beneficial. Treatment for others should be similar to that of erythema. Commonly referred to as &quot;wind droppings,&quot; it is also known as &quot;wind corpse.&quot;<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Dan Poison</strong></p>
<p>The internal poison (Dan) appears as redness and swelling from beneath the ribs to the lower back, and it is known as internal poison. If noticed early, it can be treated; however, once it reaches the waist, treatment is no longer possible. This illness often results in difficulty urinating and defecating, and it can lead to a rapid spread of a dark, blue-black coloration across the body, resulting in death within three days. For urgent treatment, apply medicinal powders directly to the affected areas and take Lianqiao Baidu Powder.</p>
<p>The external poison (You Dan) is characterized by widespread red poison across the body. Initially, it manifests as bluish discoloration in both hands, with swelling throughout. If it goes untreated for a night or two, the swelling can spread throughout the body; if it enters the heart, it leads to death. At the first sign, urgent treatment is necessary, which includes taking Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction and Mu Xiang Liuqi Drink, along with the application of Jin Guo Powder. It is advisable to treat it using methods similar to those for carbuncles.</p>
<p>Children suffering from red wandering fire poison often acquire heat in the womb from their mothers, which leads to symptoms appearing on the skin in a migratory manner.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the illness originates from the abdomen and moves outward to the limbs, it is considered light; if it originates from the limbs and returns to the abdomen, it is heavy, and urgent treatment will be necessary for survival. The children&#39;s condition, known as &quot;red fire toxin,&quot; arises from accumulated heat, which is termed &quot;fetal poison.&quot; This can occur if the mother during pregnancy consumes spicy and toxic foods, bathes in hot water, or uses charcoal in winter, allowing heat to enter the fetus, along with excessive cravings. Some children may be born wearing warm clothing or sleeping on heated bedding, leading to inner and outer heat toxins attacking the body—most will show symptoms within about six months. Initially, the body will feel hot; if observed with light, it will appear red. If the child cries uncontrollably and has an unstable appearance, those showing symptoms in the limbs are likely to survive, while those with symptoms in the waist and abdomen are unlikely to survive.</p>
<p>Immediate action must be taken: use a sharp container to remove the purple blood, allowing the toxic blood to flow downward—do not reverse the procedure. Apply powdered frankincense mixed with egg white to the affected area, and periodically apply juice from banana roots. Internally, administer a detoxifying pill made from vermilion mixed with honey, and follow it with a decoction made from &quot;purple gold&quot; preparation.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also ten types of Dan poison: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Feizao Dan, which causes swelling that begins at the top of the head, progressively becoming red and swollen, with the neck also swelling and the eyes turning red. Take a bundle of fresh scallions, crush them to extract the juice, and apply it. Alternatively, mix five qian of (Shibu) nitrate with two qian of realgar powder, and blend with juice from banana plant roots. Use a discarded brush to apply this juice. The patient should lie down so that the juice can flow from the bottom to the top, allowing the poison to exit through the Baihui point. If applied from the bottom upward, it can cause the toxin to invade the throat, which is difficult to treat. The same treatment applies to adults suffering from this.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>On Dan Poison: Difficulty and Ease</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gold Thread Sores</strong></p>
<p>Also known as Red Thread Sores, they resemble threads or ropes, varying in size. It is said that Dan poison is involved, but it is not as widespread as smoke poison. When this condition occurs on the head, if it descends to the heart, it leads to death; conversely, if it arises from below to the top, the same fate applies. One can cut at the sore&#39;s head, lightly prick to induce bleeding, then chew duckweed root and apply it for relief.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Active Principles (Yuan Zhang Jiemu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spots Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The disease of rashes has varying symptoms. If the sores are inflamed and swollen externally, they belong to the Shaoyang San Jiao&#39;s fire, known as spots; if small red dots are present beneath the skin and do not surface, they belong to the Shaoyin Jun&#39;s fire, termed rashes. For visible spot symptoms, if there is vomiting or diarrhea, one should be cautious not to treat erratically, as this indicates the evil energy is being expelled both upwards and downwards. Generally, both sores and rashes should not be purged, for fear of causing changes through reckless actions—this is referred to as Shaoyang opening the exterior, thus it is advisable to harmonize first, then slightly induce. To harmonize and detoxify, one must calm the five organs, for which Fang Feng Decoction is effective. If there is no loose stool, one requires slightly inducing medicines; many such formulas exist in Qian&#39;s prescriptions, select as needed. If constipation is present, mild laxatives should be utilized; Dang Gui Pills and Jujube-Sliced Baixiang Pills are appropriate.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Upon first recognizing the rash, if it appears all together, it is difficult for infants to endure; thus, other symptoms may arise. The head and tail should not be purged; the head refers to the upper body, and the tail refers to the lower body. If one can induce vomiting or purging, it is especially inadvisable to purge downward, as it is better to stabilize the interior. If there is no vomiting or diarrhea, first administer stabilizing medicine for three to five doses. If the child has an appetite but suffers from constipation and internal excess, it is advisable to promote smooth bowel movement. If there is internal deficiency resulting in diarrhea, interior medicine should be used, ending with a dose to gently stimulate. Generally, there is much medicine for stabilizing the interior and little for dispersing pathogenic factors; if there is constipation, one should gently relieve it to avoid blockage of pathogenic energy, allowing it to alternate and making it easier for the child to endure. If the body is warm, treatment should proceed smoothly; if the body is cool, treatment should be reversed. In both cases, it is beneficial to take more doses of wind-dispelling decoction to help stabilize the interior. If there is significant constipation but the child can eat, consider using angelica pills to gently alleviate it.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Certification of Wind-Heat</strong></p>
<p>Wind-heat, accompanied by phlegm, arises from within and manifests externally. The method for this is found in Tongsheng Powder, which should be used for mild sweating; it must not be purged. For internal injuries leading to rashes, there is severe vacuity of stomach qi, with fire circulating outward. It is advisable to nourish and descend, as suggested in “Essentials for Yin Syndromes.” If the rash resembles that of typhoid, it signifies the disease of phlegm-heat manifesting externally; mild sweating is the remedy, and purging would be inappropriate. </p>
<p>As for rashes related to heat and phlegm in the lungs, clearing lung fire and descending phlegm may be effective, with sweating also being an option, though purging is applicable in certain cases. Rashes are akin to sores; sweating can lead to recovery, as indicated in Tongsheng Powder.</p>
<p>Pruritic rashes often pertain to the spleen, subtly present between the skin layers, hence they are called pruritic rashes. When they develop, they may often be itchy or numb, indicating a combination of wind and warmth. Rashes appearing red indicate accompanying transformation of heat. Cucumber water can pacify the &quot;Dragon Liver&quot; and eliminate red dots and spots. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Rashes that appear as small raised bumps should be treated immediately upon their emergence, as they may reappear after being treated, unlike spots that do not have a raised head. The diseases related to these rashes vary. If sores develop with swelling externally, they belong to the less yang category of the Sanjiao and are called spots; small red rashes that are internal and do not emerge belong to the less yin category of the governing fire and are called rashes.</p>
<p>For febrile diseases, there are four types of spots that can appear. Among them, the spots from warm toxins are the most severe. Bright red spots indicate heat in the stomach, while purplish-black spots indicate stomach decay. The treatment timing may differ, either early or late, and these are caused by externally contracted febrile diseases. Medications such as Yuan Shen, Sheng Ma, and Bai Hu can be prescribed.</p>
<p>For yin-representing spots, they may also appear on the back and chest and can show up on the hands and feet; they are usually few and faintly red. If treated as a heat condition, the use of cooling medicines would be a significant mistake. This condition arises from a fire without a root, which gathers in the chest, affecting the lungs and manifesting as spots on the skin. These spots resemble those from mosquitoes or lice, rather than elaborate patterns. It is best to regulate the middle, warm the stomach, and use seasonings like fennel and peony, or employ methods similar to Da Jian Zhong. Allowing the fire to descend will help the spots retreat, thus addressing the root of the problem rather than merely the symptoms.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fadan (Red Rash)</strong></p>
<p>The colors and conditions of Fadan vary; the itchiness and pain also differ. Generally, this arises from blood heat, weak muscles, and wind evils attacking the body. Those with a red color are more common, hence they are referred to as Dan. It is advisable to dispel wind and scatter it by grinding the seeds of burnt sweet gum into a powder and taking it with wine. If the rash appears and is white, it is called Lengmo (Cold Rash), and it is best to dispel wind and scatter it using a blend of black shen powder mixed with wine. This ailment usually stems from loose muscles being attacked by wind evils. Wind heat results in redness, and wind cold results in paleness. This is what people today refer to as red being Dan and white being Mo. Therefore, using wine to combine with Tujv (earth red pigment) leads to healing, as the spleen governs the muscles, and earth can nourish the spleen, aligning with its nature. The ancient method was called Yinzhen (a type of rash), which recognizes not only cold and heat but also includes the four Qi (vital energies). Recent discussions refer to the white type as Polmo (white rash) and the red type as Xuefeng (blood wind). Both red and white conditions can utilize Wuyao Shunqi San (a herbal remedy for wind and gas), taken with wine. For those with a white condition, use Shunqi San more often, while those with a red condition should use Xiaofeng San more frequently. Those suffering from this should also use the decoction of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San. Some people should never eat chicken or animals like deer that might provoke wind; if they do, the rash appears, indicating a connection to spleen wind. The spleen governs all the muscles in the body, and Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San is a medicine for treating the spleen, while Tujv also acts in support of the spleen’s function. This prescription has repeatedly proven effective.<br><strong>[Medical Introduction]<br>[Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan]</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Rash and Wind</strong></p>
<p>Rashes belong to the fire without roots in the Three Heaters; the rashes relate to the fire of the heart, both affecting the lungs. External causes initially present with headaches, high fever, and a change in taste; avoiding excessive sweating and purging is advisable. It is best to lightly relieve muscle tension and induce mild sweating; if there is self-induced vomiting or diarrhea, it is considered cured. </p>
<p>For internal causes, if there is slight headache but the palms are hot and the spleen and stomach are weak, one should fortify to reduce the fire; for those with strong bodies, clearing the lungs to transform the flesh is advisable. If there are color marks without raised spots, especially red like brocade in patches on the chest and abdomen, the harms are due to misinterpreted cold damage or excessive purging of heart fire causing complex ailments, primarily a combination of wind-heat with phlegm. The fire of the lesser yang emerges from within. </p>
<p>Treatment should focus on soothing internal medication with less emphasis on releasing exterior conditions. For those with external infections, Bai Du San added with Zi Cao, or Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang with Yuan Shen. For sore throats, use Yuan Shen Sheng Ma Tang. For madness or bleeding, use Yang Du Sheng Ma Tang. For thirst, use Hua Ban Tang. If there is constipation, use Fang Feng Tong Sheng San with slight effectiveness, avoiding the use of Nao Huang. For body aches, add Cang Zhu and Qiang Huo. For phlegm coughs, add Ban Xia. If heat is severe, consider Hei Nu Wan. For deep rashes, use He Gao. </p>
<p>For internal injuries causing spots that resemble mosquito bite marks, often found on hands and feet, if there is no initial headache or fever, it indicates weak stomach fire spilling outward. It is advisable to use Tiao Zhong Yi Qi Tang or Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang. If internal phlegm heat attacks the head and face, it’s recommended to employ Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang with Yuan Shen, Bei Mu, Huang Qin, Sheng Di, and Mai Men Dong. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Red and White Wind</strong></p>
<p>Red and white wind is associated with deficiency of spleen and lung qi, with open pores unable to withstand wind-heat. This can occur due to cold blocking the pores, with internal heat stagnating; or due to yin deficiency leading to fire movement and external pathogens taking advantage; or due to liver fire and wind-heat. Treatment methods: for wind-heat, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Fang Feng and Lian Qiao; for blood heat, use Si Wu Decoction with added Chai Hu, Shan Zhi Zi, and Dan Pi; for combatting wind-heat, use Jing Fang Bai Du San; for internal heat and external cold, use modified Qiang Huo San; for weak stomach qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Qiang Huo and Fang Feng, along with Xiao Feng San; for blood deficiency, use modified Xiao Yao San and Liu Wei Wan. If there is liver and kidney deficiency heat, Liu Wei Wan will self-regulate fire, stabilize wind, and alleviate itching. However, if pungent heat dispelling agents are used, liver blood will become drier, wind and fire will intensify, original qi will further deplete, pores will remain open, wind will invade internally, kidney qi will be harmed, fire will converge, and blood will transform with fire, leading to a more difficult-to-treat condition.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Du (Erysipelas)</strong></p>
<p>In the case of erysipelas in children, if the entire body turns red and is not treated with needling, the toxic energy can enter the abdomen and become untreatable. This condition is caused by poisonous hot blood accumulating in the vital gate, triggered by fire. If it appears as red spots, the bad blood must be needled out to bring forth good blood. If it swells and is red, moving unpredictably, first apply raw sesame oil to the affected area and needle it to release the poison. As for cases that originate from the limbs and enter the abdomen, they should not be treated. Though there are several types of dan and various methods of treatment, needling remains the most effective approach. I have observed that cases that are somewhat severe, when not treated with needling, cannot be saved.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Rash</strong></p>
<p>For a floating pulse, the treatment should focus on dispelling wind. If the pulse is floating and rapid, the approach should be to expel wind and clear heat. If the pulse is deep and rapid, the main treatment should be to drain fire. If the rapid pulse feels firm upon pressure, the method involves relieving exterior symptoms and attacking internal issues.<br><strong>(From &quot;Orthodox Practice in External Medicine&quot; by Chen Shigong, Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Fire poison arises from excessive heart fire and the wind-heat of the triple burner, which manifests on the surface of the skin. It may present differently in terms of dryness and wetness, as well as variations in color. In dry cases, the color is red, resembling cloud fragments, with wind blisters that itch and feel hot. This pertains to the fire of the heart and liver meridians, treated by cooling the heart and draining the liver, using the &quot;Transforming Rash Detoxifying Decoction.&quot; In wet cases, the color is more yellowish-white, with varying sizes that ooze and cause pain. This relates to the damp-heat of the spleen and lung meridians, warranting treatment to clear the lungs, drain the spleen, and eliminate dampness, using the &quot;Wei Ling Decoction.&quot; If the rash arises in the lower back and flanks, it is due to excessive liver fire, known as “waist wrap fire poison,” treated with &quot;Chai Hu Qing Gan Decoction,&quot; with external application of cypress leaf powder or &quot;Ruyi Jinhuang San.&quot;<br>The rash can be triggered by toxins encountered before birth, manifesting after birth.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The body in the womb relies on the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood for nourishment. If the parents cannot restrain their desires, and the passion turns rampant, the fetus will inevitably be affected. Additionally, if they do not avoid rich flavors and are exposed to smoke and heat from cooking, or if they are bundled in heavy blankets, the fetus often suffers from overheating, which can be passed on to the child. After birth, if the baby is washed with hot water and the clothes are exposed to heat, internal toxins can be triggered, leading to the baby feeling heat first, crying out in alarm, and experiencing swelling; this can manifest as redness and heat that moves unpredictably, often starting from the forehead, known as &quot;Tian Zhao Dan,&quot; treatable with Shengma and Geggen decoctions for both mother and child. If symptoms arise from the abdomen and back, they are lighter; those starting from the limbs and affecting the chest and abdomen are heavier. The key is to first treat the bad blood. After treating the blood, slices of fresh pig meat should be applied to the affected area, routinely replaced with a golden powder mixed with water and banana juice, preferably changed twice daily. Internally, use drinks like Dalianqiao decoction, Xieduoxiang decoction, and Wufu detoxifying pills. If toxins cause the abdomen to swell and harden, leading to an inability to nurse, Zixue powder can be administered. After three days, the body gradually cools down, the treated areas become soft and active, sounds are clear, the abdomen softens, and nursing returns to normal. Conversely, if these symptoms do not resolve, it indicates a setback.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Bumps and Rashes</strong></p>
<p>The condition of bumps and rashes, though already well-documented in standard texts, generally refers to children&#39;s measles. However, in cases where adults or children suddenly develop bumps or rashes that are not measles, while similar, there are indeed slight differences that must be distinguished for proper treatment. This is often caused by external wind-heat. </p>
<p>The treatment method: if the pulse is floating and there is a fever with exterior symptoms, the primary focus should be on dispersing the wind pathogen. If the pulse is floating and rapid, clear the heat while expelling wind; if the pulse is deep and slippery without exterior symptoms, focus on clearing fire. If the pulse is both floating and deep, slippery and rapid with symptoms present both internally and externally, it is advisable to treat both the exterior and interior simultaneously. </p>
<p>Moreover, this condition is more commonly seen in children, and one must assess their internal and external state of deficiency and excess to determine treatment. Overall, since children are fragile, more nourishing medicines should be used while less aggressive methods are preferable. If symptoms are secretive, mild dispersal is appropriate; if they are constricted, gentle guidance is appropriate. The aim is to ensure that the pathogenic qi does not stagnate but disperses easily, allowing the condition to be lighter and more stable. In general, warmth in the body indicates a beneficial direction, while coolness suggests a harmful one.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A middle-aged man developed a carbuncle that ruptured, experiencing fever, dry vomiting, and a red rash on his back. Various topical treatments and bloodletting on the carbuncle were applied, but the rash did not subside. Additionally, using half C, Chen, and ginger combined with tonics for vomiting was ineffective. Therefore, a decoction of half an ounce of ginseng, and half a coin each of angelica and atractylodes was prepared. After one application, the vomiting ceased; with two or three applications, the rash gradually eased and the fever decreased. After about fifty applications, the fever was finally eliminated, and vital energy began to recover.</p>
<p>Another case involved a man named Bao Yun, aged fifty, who suffered severe itching from wind rashes, mild abdominal pain, and difficulty in swallowing, with slight swelling of the face and body. The symptoms persisted for five to six days, and his pulse was large and slippery, with the right pulse being floating and large, while the left was floating and thin. A formula consisting of fried scutellaria, fried platycodon, angelica, ligusticum, peony, earth, tangerine peel, licorice, sticky millet, and purple vine, each one coin, and half a coin of asarum and astragalus was used. After five or six applications, the condition stabilized.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>An elderly man suffered from a rash that was slightly red and caused itching and fever. After taking two doses of a ginseng-based formula to dispel pathogens, he saw slight improvement, and was fully cured after taking a modified Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Huangqin and Shanzhizi.</p>
<p>A young child experienced a rash accompanied by pain, fever, and thirst. He wanted to take a cooling drink, but upon checking his pulse, it was found to be weak, indicating that the pathogen was in the meridians and could not be purged. Therefore, two doses of a detoxifying and wind-dispelling decoction were used, resulting in recovery. This condition often affects children, requiring careful examination to determine whether the illness is on the surface or deeper, as well as the severity of the pathogen for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>A man developed red spots all over his body, resembling a rash, every autumn and winter. This was caused by cold air constricting the pores, preventing the rising of yang qi, resulting in internal stagnation. Remedying this situation required a ginseng-based formula to dispel the exterior pathogenic factor, followed by a Baizhong Yiqi Decoction to bolster energy and firm the exterior. He mistakenly believed it was a hot toxin and self-medicated with cooling herbs, which exacerbated his condition. He later sought treatment again, receiving Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Fuling, Banxia, and Qianghuo in four doses, followed by more doses of the same decoction, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man developed lumps during autumn, a sign of deficiency in vital energy with external invasion. He initially took two doses of a nine-flavor Qianghuo Decoction, followed by Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Qianghuo and Fangfeng, resulting in recovery. Later, he was careless with his daily routine, experiencing night sweats, afternoon fevers, dry mouth, phlegm in the throat, and fatigue with reluctance to speak. This was treated with Baizhong Yiqi Decoction and modified Eight Flavor Pill, which led to his recovery.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a condition known as red and white wandering wind, with severe itching and afternoon fever. I prescribed herbs to clear the liver and nourish the blood. Distrustful, she took a major leprosy remedy, which caused arm pain and muscle spasms. Following this, she took herbs designed to resolve phlegm and regulate qi, but her limbs became weak, leading to her demise.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had a rash like toxic poison that she scratched open, leading to a profuse discharge of pus, experiencing thirst and headache, which worsened in the evening; she was cured with a modified Xiao Yao San.<br>A woman suffered from a previous condition, repeatedly using herbal remedies for wind, resulting in abdominal distention and ultimately death.<br>A girl had a redness like sunset clouds, accompanied by itching and fever; she was cured with a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding raw Rehmannia, Forsythia, and Paeonia.<br>A man suffered from toxic poison, experiencing burning pain and constipation, with a rapid and strong pulse; he took Feng Feng Tong Sheng San, but it did not work. Needling the affected area to remove the bad blood and then using the previous remedy led to recovery.<br>A child had a leg affected by a rash like clouds, which moved unpredictably; first, sesame oil was applied to the area, bad blood was needled out, the poison then dispersed, and after administering honeysuckle powder, the child was stable.<br>Another child had a mild external appearance but suffered from internal constipation; this condition was related to the organs, treated with Dalian Qiao Drink and God’s Efficacy Powder, resulting in recovery.<br>One child had redness all over; needling was done, and detoxifying medicine was administered, leading to immediate recovery.<br>Another child also had widespread redness but was not treated with needling, resulting in the poison gas entering the abdomen, leading to fatality. This condition was due to toxic hot blood accumulating in the life gate, stirred by fire; rashes should be needled to remove bad blood for improvement. For swellings appearing red and moving unpredictably, it is crucial to first apply raw sesame oil to the affected area and needle it to release the poison. The best method is indeed through needling.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>
