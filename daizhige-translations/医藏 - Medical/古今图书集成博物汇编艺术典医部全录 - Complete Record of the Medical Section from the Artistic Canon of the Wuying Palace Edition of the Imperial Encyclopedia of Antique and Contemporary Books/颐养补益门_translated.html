<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Nature of Ancient Times</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times during the era of Huangdi, when he was born, he was divine; though weak, he could speak, and in his youth, he displayed harmony. As he grew up, he became both earnest and perceptive, ultimately ascending to the heavens. He then asked the celestial teacher: I have heard that the people of ancient times lived to be a hundred years old, remaining vigorous in both movement and spirit, while contemporary individuals show signs of decline by the age of fifty. Is this due to a difference in the times, or is it the fault of mankind? </p>
<p>Qibo replied: The people of ancient times understood the Way; they aligned themselves with yin and yang and were harmonious in their understanding of numbers and sequences. [Note: Yin and yang are the beginnings and ends of all things, the essence of life and death. When one goes against them, disasters arise; when one follows them, illnesses do not occur. Thus, the ability to adhere to and harmonize with these principles is called achieving the Way.] They had moderation in diet and drink, regularity in their daily routines, and did not recklessly exert themselves. Therefore, they were able to maintain both body and spirit, completing their natural lifespan of a hundred years before departing. [Note: Moderation in diet and drink nourishes one&#39;s energy. Regularity in daily routines nurtures the spirit. Avoiding reckless exertion preserves one&#39;s essence. By nurturing both spirit and energy, they could coexist and complete their lives.]</p>
<p>Contemporary individuals, however, are different; they take wine as sustenance and treat recklessness as the norm. They indulge in drunkenness, reducing their essence through excessive desires, not knowing how to retain fullness, failing to manage their spirit in due time, and seeking instant gratification, which goes against the joys of life. With irregular daily routines, they decline by the age of fifty. [Note: Modern people pursue pleasure but are incapable of conserving their essence and spirit, which leads to their decline by fifty.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>In ancient times, the teachings of the sages taught that there are things to avoid, considered as empty and deceptive winds, to be avoided at appropriate times. They advocated for tranquility and emptiness, allowing true energy to flow, keeping the spirit guarded within, and thus illness has no cause. Therefore, with a tranquil will and few desires, the heart finds peace and has no fear. The body may work hard but does not tire, and energy flows in harmony; each follows their own desires, and all attain what they wish.</p>
<p>Thus, they appreciated their food, accepted their clothing, enjoyed their customs, and neither envied the high nor despised the low, which is why their people were called simple. Hence, their desires could not fatigue their eyes, nor could corruptive temptations confuse their hearts. Whether wise or foolish, honorable or base, they were not afraid of material things, thereby aligning with the Way. This is why they could live to a hundred years, still active without decline, as their virtue was complete and not endangered.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were true individuals who grasped heaven and earth, controlled yin and yang, breathed in vital energy, stood firmly guarding their spirit, their bodies were unified, allowing them to endure the ages without end. This is how their path came into being.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>In ancient times, there was a truly enlightened person, possessing pure virtue and complete understanding of the Way, harmonizing with yin and yang, adjusting to the four seasons. They withdrew from the world and separated from worldly affairs, accumulating essence and refining spirit, wandering between heaven and earth, perceiving beyond ordinary sights and sounds. This naturally extended their lifespan and fortified them, leading them also to becoming a true human.</p>
<p>(Note: This is derived from practice and cultivation to secure one’s being, fully realizing true nature and returning to the Way.)</p>
<p>Next, there are the sages, who dwell in harmony with heaven and earth, conforming to the principles of the eight winds, moderating desires within worldly matters, free from anger and resentment, engaging in life without wanting to separate from the world. Their garments are simple and unadorned, they do not desire to observe the ordinary, their outward form does not toil over matters, and inwardly they are free from the troubles of thought. They prioritize tranquility and joy, deeming self-contentment as success, their body remains unbroken, and their spirit unscattered; thus, they can also attain longevity into the hundreds.</p>
<p>(Note: Sages can also roam freely and enjoy a long life of a hundred years.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are the wise individuals who align themselves with the principles of heaven and earth, reflect the sun and moon, distinguish the constellations, and follow the ebb and flow of yin and yang, recognizing the four seasons. They draw from ancient teachings, harmonizing with the Way, and can also enhance their lifespan to the utmost extent.</p>
<p>(Note: The wise unite humanity with heaven, transcending the ordinary to reach the sacred.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>On Balancing the Four Seasons and Nurturing the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>In the third month of spring, this is known as the season of emergence. Heaven and Earth together give birth, and all things flourish. Sleep at night and rise early, take wide strides in the courtyard, and let your hair down to relax your form, thereby allowing the spirit to flourish. Life should not be killed, give freely rather than take, reward without punishing. This corresponds to the spring energy and the way of nurturing life. To go against this harms the liver, leading to cold transformations in summer, resulting in fewer longevity benefits.</p>
<p>(Annotation: The rising spring sun nurtures all things, bringing forth new life; thus, all things thrive. Sleeping at night and rising early generates vital energy. Letting down your hair allows for the smooth flow of the liver&#39;s wood energy; moving slowly and gently corresponds to the warm energy of spring. To go against the natural growth of spring&#39;s energy harms the liver. If the liver is injured, it leads to cold diseases in summer due to fewer beneficial outcomes. When wood is harmed, it cannot generate fire; thus, during the summer, when fire should dominantly rule, it ironically transforms into cold diseases.) </p>
<p>In the third month of summer, this is the season of flourishing blossoms. The interaction of Heaven and Earth’s energies brings about the flowering and bearing of all things.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>At night, sleep early and rise early, without weariness from the long days, allowing your aspirations to remain undisturbed. Let the blossoms and beauty flourish, and your energy finds release, as if what you cherish is outside. This is the response to summer&#39;s energy, the way of nurturing growth. To go against it harms the heart; in autumn, it leads to fevers and plagues, and those who gather are few, resulting in serious illness in winter.</p>
<p>Note: The yang energy is abundant and flourishing, hence it is splendid and beautiful. Sleeping early and rising early nurtures the growing energy. One should not grow weary of the long days, as the energy should not be idle. The heart is associated with fire and rules in summer; to go against the growth of summer energy injures the heart. When the heart is wounded, by autumn it results in fevers and plagues, especially as there are few who harvest. </p>
<p>The yang energy originally emerges from the lower yin organs; now in summer, if it is opposed high up without collecting in autumn, it leads to difficulties in harvesting, leaving nothing stored for winter. When yang does not return to its source, it means the root energy is depleted; thus, when winter comes with the cold waters commanding, there is no warm yang to counter it, leading to severe dangers of illness in winter.</p>
<p>In autumn&#39;s three months, this is the season of harmony and balance. The weather becomes urgent, and the earth’s energy becomes clear. Sleep early and wake early, rising with the rooster.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>To keep the spirit calm and ease the burdens of autumn, gather and focus one&#39;s energy, allowing the autumn essence to be even and undisturbed, and thus cleanse the lung&#39;s energy. This is the response to autumn&#39;s essence and the way to nurture and gather. To go against it injures the lungs, leading to winter ailments and diminished nurturance.</p>
<p>In winter, during the three months, this is the time for closure and storage. The water freezes and the earth cracks; do not disturb the yang energy. Go to bed early and rise late, waiting for the sunlight. Ensure the spirit is subdued and hidden, with no hidden intentions or desires, moving away from the cold to warmth, avoiding skin exposures that would cause energy loss. This is the response to winter&#39;s essence and the way to nurture and store. To oppose it injures the kidneys, leading to springtime debility and reduced vitality.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The yang energy should be preserved and not disturbed, as this would leak it away. One should go to bed early and rise late to nurture and conceal this energy. By maintaining a hidden and reclusive mindset, one can avoid distractions. If there are selfish intentions or desires, the spirit and energy will remain concealed within. One should seek warmth and eliminate cold to sustain this yang. Yang energy is rooted in the greatest yin and manifests on the surface of the skin; if the exterior is not secure or dense, the inner energy tends to surge outward, which would lead to a loss of the skin&#39;s yang and hastily deprive it of its root energy. The kidneys are associated with water and rule over winter; if one goes against the winter&#39;s energy and does not store it, the kidneys will be harmed. If kidney energy is weakened, it can lead to conditions like atrophy or paralysis by spring, due to insufficient nourishment from the source.</p>
<p>The heavenly atmosphere is clear and bright. Its virtues are not only stored but also unyielding. When heaven is bright, the sun and moon do not shine clearly, allowing evil influences to invade the voids, closing off the yang energy while the earthly energy emerges. If clouds and mist are not refined, this results in white dew not falling. The connection is disrupted, and as a result, life cannot flourish. Without proper manifestation, there will be an excess of dead wood. Malicious energy does not manifest, rain and wind lose their seasonal order, and the white dew fails to fall, causing plants to wither and lose their vitality. Harsh winds frequently arise, and violent rains occur repeatedly.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Heaven and earth and the four seasons do not support each other; when they are disconnected from the Way, chaos and destruction ensue. The qi of heaven is pure, clear, and bright; yet, the bright virtue is only hidden while operating vigorously and ceaselessly, hence it is unnecessary to call it &quot;down&quot; just because it descends. If the bright virtue of heaven were to be unveiled instead of concealed, then the sun and moon would not shine. If the virtue of heaven were not concealed, it would lose its pure, bright essence, allowing evil to take advantage of its emptiness and cause harm. If heaven did not continuously operate, then the earthly qi would rise and obscure its brightness. If clouds and mist are not refined, it is due to the earthly qi not ascending. If the earthly qi does not ascend, then the heavenly qi does not descend, and white dew does not fall. Though the qi of heaven and earth may communicate vertically, if it does not manifest beyond the six directions and nine provinces, then the lives of all things cannot receive nourishment and transformation, hence many trees perish. If malign qi does not emit, then the strict and severe commands are lost; if wind and rain are out of balance, then the governance of warmth and brightness is lost; if white dew does not fall, then there will be no moistening and nourishing mists.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>When the seasons are out of order, even abundant trees and fine grains cannot thrive. If the yang energy is excessive and not in harmony, violent winds frequently arise; if the yin energy is excessive and unnatural, sudden storms will occur. When heaven and earth fail to maintain the balance of yin and yang through the seasons and neglect the path of cultivation, a catastrophic downfall is inevitable. </p>
<p>Only the sage can adapt to this, therefore they do not suffer from unusual ailments, all things flourish, and vital energy does not diminish. The sage effectively harmonizes with the disharmony of the seasons while internally cultivating their spirit, thus avoiding the harms of sudden violence. By aligning with the irregularities of the external environment and maintaining the natural state of all things, their vital energy remains unwavering.</p>
<p>When opposing the spring energy, the lesser yang does not emerge, and the liver energy undergoes internal changes. When opposing the summer energy, the greater yang does not grow, and the heart energy becomes obstructed. When opposing the autumn energy, the lesser yin does not gather, leading to excess in the lungs. When opposing the winter energy, the greater yin does not conceal, causing the kidney energy to sink. The yin and yang of the four seasons are the foundation of all things.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Thus, the sage nourishes Yang in spring and summer, and nourishes Yin in autumn and winter, to adhere to their roots, thereby harmonizing with the rise and fall of all things in the cycle of growth. To go against this root would undermine its foundation and damage its essence. </p>
<p>(Note: The footnote explains that Lesser Yang governs the energy of spring; if this energy goes against its nature, it will not flourish, leading to stagnation of liver energy and internal changes. Greater Yang governs the energy of summer; without growth, heart energy becomes deficient and empty. Greater Yin governs autumn&#39;s harvest; without harvest, lung heat causes drying and swelling. Lesser Yin governs the energy of winter; without storage, kidney energy becomes weak and isolated. The energies of the four seasons—Yin and Yang, growth and storage—nurture and transform all around, thus forming the foundation of all things. In spring and summer, Yang is abundant externally but deficient internally; in autumn and winter, Yin is abundant externally but deficient internally. Hence, the sage nourishes Yang in spring and summer and Yin in autumn and winter to cultivate according to their roots, facilitating the return to the cycle of growth for all things. If one goes against this root, it would undermine the foundation and bring about disaster, which is to damage its essence.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Therefore, the yin and yang and the four seasons are the beginnings and ends of all things, the source of life and death. To go against them results in disaster; to follow them prevents serious illness. This is called following the Way. The Way is practiced by the sage and embraced by the foolish.</p>
<p>The phenomena of heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the four seasons give rise to all things, having beginnings and ends of life and death. To go against them leads to disaster; to follow them prevents serious illness. This is called understanding the Way of yin and yang. </p>
<p>Following yin and yang brings life; going against them brings death. Following leads to order; going against leads to chaos. To oppose what should be right is to act internally against oneself. Therefore, the sage does not treat existing illnesses but rather addresses unmanifested diseases; does not rectify existing chaos but instead prevents chaos from arising. This is the true meaning. </p>
<p>When illness has already manifested, it is too late to apply medicine; when chaos has already arisen, it is too late to restore order. This is akin to digging a well when thirsty or forging a nail after the fight has begun; is it not too late? </p>
<p>The yin and yang of heaven and earth are consistent with the four seasons and the five elements; the yin and yang of the human body similarly correspond to the five elements and six energies. Thus, following them brings life, while going against them results in death. Acting internally against oneself means rejecting the vital energies of the five organs, leading to counterproductive actions.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Harmonizing with the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Since ancient times, the way to harmonize with the heavens is the foundation of life, stemming from the yin and yang. Between heaven and earth, within the six directions, the energies circulate through the nine regions and nine apertures, the five organs and twelve joints, all connected to the heavenly qi. There are five aspects of life and three kinds of qi. If one frequently violates these, then evil qi harms people. This is the root of lifespan.</p>
<p>The three refer to the three yin and three yang. The three yin are cold, dryness, and dampness; the three yang are wind, fire, and heat. If one cannot nourish oneself and frequently encounters these three yin and yang energies, then evil qi will harm one, affecting one&#39;s lifespan.</p>
<p>The energy of the clear heavens, when pure, promotes focused intention; following it strengthens the yang qi, which cannot be harmed even by malicious forces. This follows the order of the seasons, thus the sage transmits spirit, conforms to the heavenly energies, and connects with divine clarity.</p>
<p>If one aligns with this pure energy, then the body&#39;s yang qi remains strong against harm, even in the presence of fierce winds. This is due to the natural order of the seasons. When one is in a state of tranquility, the flesh tightens and wards off harm; even harsh winds cannot cause damage. This again is due to the natural order of the times.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The energy of the skin and pores is the essence of the five viscera, hence one should cultivate accordingly to the rhythms of the four seasons and the five elements. When the essence of the five viscera flows freely, a person will be calm and harmonious, preventing any decline in the body&#39;s condition, thus there is no way for pathogens to invade the pores.</p>
<p>Therefore, the yang energy governs the exterior over the course of a day. At dawn, the human energy begins to rise; at midday, the yang energy peaks; and by evening, the yang energy diminishes, causing the gates of energy to close. Thus, at dusk, one should draw inward, avoiding strain on the muscles and bones, and not exposing oneself to mist or dew. If this cycle is reversed, the body will become weak and depleted.</p>
<p>In the morning, human energy begins to grow, which is why dawn is enlightening; at midday, the energy increases, allowing it to overcome evils; in the evening, the energy begins to decline. By midnight, human energy enters the viscera, blocking the influence of pathogens. One should avoid straining the muscles and bones and seek tranquility, avoiding exposure to mist and dew. If this is reversed, the body&#39;s energy will be troubled and weakened by pathogens.</p>
<p>Thus, the sage articulates the harmony of yin and yang, ensuring the tendons and veins are balanced, the bones and marrow are strong, and the qi and blood are in proper flow. In this way, internal and external harmony is achieved, preventing harm from pathogens, allowing the senses to remain sharp, and maintaining one&#39;s energy as it should be.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Jīn Kuì Zhēn Yán Lùn</strong></p>

<p>When the ruler (heart) is clear, the subordinates (organs) are at peace. By nurturing life in this way, one will enjoy longevity and will not face danger in the world. If the ruler is unclear, the twelve officials (organs) are endangered, blocking the pathways and causing great harm to the body; thus, nurturing life in this way leads to catastrophe. If the heart is not clear, then the twelve officials will be unsettled. When the spirit is disordered, it causes blood and channels to coagulate, blocking the pathways. When the channels are obstructed, the body suffers greatly, leading to a calamity.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Exposition on the Theory of the Five Qi</h3>
<p>The injuries caused by the five labors are: prolonged viewing injures the blood, prolonged lying injures the qi, prolonged sitting injures the flesh, prolonged standing injures the bones, and prolonged walking injures the tendons. These are the injuries caused by the five labors. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: In ancient times, people labored without fatigue. Prolonged viewing depletes the spirit, thus injuring the blood. Prolonged lying causes the qi to stagnate, hence injuring the qi. The spleen benefits from movement, so prolonged sitting injures the flesh. Prolonged standing injures the waist, kidneys, and knees, thus injuring the bones. Exhausting one’s walking injures the tendons. Thus, these five labors injure the blood, qi, tendons, and bones governed by the five organs.]</strong></p>
<h3>Spiritual Pivot</h3>
<h4>On the Mind and Spirit</h4>
<p>What exists within me from heaven is virtue; what exists within me from earth is qi. Virtue flows thinly to give rise to life. Therefore, the essence of life is called essence; the interaction of two essences is called spirit; what follows the spirit is called soul; the essence that enters and exits together is called po. Hence, the steward of things is called heart; when the heart remembers, it is called intent; what intent holds is called will; based on will, changes are stored, referred to as thought; arising from thought, distant longings are considered as concerns; and pertaining to concerns, interaction with things is termed wisdom. Thus, in the maintenance of life by the wise, one must follow the four seasons and adapt to cold and heat; harmonize joy and anger, and stay peacefully settled; moderate yin and yang to balance hardness and softness; if done so, then evil and deviance will not approach, leading to long life and prolonged vision.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: Therefore, the wise follow and embody the nature of heaven and earth to attain the way of nurturing life.]</strong><a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Five Tastes</strong></p>
<p>The five tastes that enter the mouth each have their pathways and their respective ailments. Sour penetrates the tendons; excessive consumption leads to urinary issues. Salty penetrates the blood; excessive consumption causes thirst. Spicy penetrates the qi; excessive consumption unsettles the heart. Bitter penetrates the bones; excessive consumption induces vomiting. Sweet penetrates the flesh; excessive consumption harms the heart. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The heart governs blood, and the kidneys govern bones. Bitter is a fire taste, while salty is a water taste. The interplay of bitter affecting bones and salty affecting blood reflects the balance of yin and yang, water and fire. The lungs govern qi, hence spicy affects qi.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter on the Organs</strong></p>
<p>When blood is harmonious, the meridians flow smoothly, nourishing both yin and yang, strengthening tendons and bones, and clearing the joints. When the guardian qi is harmonious, it aids in meat division and eliminates blockages, making the skin supple and the pores tight. When the mind and will are harmonious, the spirit remains focused, the soul and essence do not scatter, remorse and anger do not arise, and the five organs are protected from evils. When cold and warmth are balanced, the six bowels process food properly, wind and pain do not occur, the meridians are unobstructed, and the limbs find comfort. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When blood, qi, and spirit are in harmony, the five organs are safeguarded from evils, and the body remains at peace.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on the Origin of Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Excessive joy and anger damage the organs; when the organs are harmed, ailments arise from within. When dampness invades the weak, illnesses develop in the lower body; when wind and rain attack the weak, ailments manifest in the upper body.<br>(Note: According to this text, wind and cold harm the body, while worry, fear, anger, and joy disturb the spirit. When the spirit is harmed, it affects the organs, leading to illness; cold harms the body, hence illnesses related to the body arise; wind injures the tendons, responding to such injury. This reflects the interaction between the internal and external aspects of body and spirit.)</p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</strong></p>
<p>Winds that come from their native regions are termed true winds and are responsible for nourishing all living things. Winds that arrive from conflict zones are called false winds, which harm individuals, bringing death and destruction; one must be careful to avoid these false winds. Thus, the sage advises avoiding malicious forces as one would dodge arrows and stones, ensuring one is not harmed by them.<br>(Note: True winds include the east wind of spring, the south wind of summer, the west wind of autumn, and the north wind of winter, as well as the southeast wind at the transition of spring and summer and the northwest wind at the transition of autumn and winter; these are the vital energies of the four seasons, responsible for nurturing all. In contrast, winds that come from conflict zones, such as southwest winds in winter or northwest winds during spring equinox, signify wrongly adjusted winds that harm individuals and destroy life. Hence, the sage advises avoiding such malevolent forces as one would dodge arrows and stones.)<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Jinkui Yaolue</strong> [Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji]</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>In all matters of diet and flavor, the aim is to nourish life. If food is detrimental, it can cause harm. Unless one is taking medicinal elixirs, how can one avoid food? It is evident that people nowadays neglect regulation and care, leading to an increase in diseases and disasters; if one does not get ill from food, then to preserve life, one must be aware of what to avoid. The flavors of food may either be beneficial or harmful to the body. If suitable, they enhance health; if harmful, they cause illness, leading to serious dangers that are often difficult to treat. For all medicinal decoctions aimed at detoxification, although they are said to be for urgent relief, they should not be consumed hot. In cases of poisoning, consuming them hot exacerbates the condition, so they should be taken cold.</p>
<p>For liver diseases, pungent flavors should be avoided; for heart conditions, salty flavors; for spleen issues, sour flavors; for lung diseases, bitter flavors; and for kidney ailments, sweet flavors. In spring, do not eat liver; in summer, do not eat heart; in autumn, do not eat lungs; and in winter, do not eat kidneys; and throughout the four seasons, do not eat spleen. In spring, avoiding liver is crucial because the liver is dominant, and if spleen energy is weakened, consuming liver would further support it. Weak spleen energy is especially difficult to remedy. Furthermore, during the dominant time of the liver, one should not introduce dead energy into the liver, for that may disturb the spirit. If it is not the dominant season, then supplementation of the liver is favorable. The same principle applies to other organs.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Zhong Cang Jing</strong> (The Book of the Central Repository) <strong>by Hua Tuo, Han Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Balancing Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Heaven is the source of Yang, and Earth belongs to Yin. Yang is the root of life, while Yin is the foundation of death. Between Heaven and Earth, humans assist in the balancing of Yin and Yang. Those who nurture Yang thrive, while those who cultivate Yin perish. The highest essence of Yang is the supreme truth, and the deepest aspect of Yin is the mysterious spirit. Therefore, those aligned with Yang live long, while those aligned with Yin have shorter lives. Excessive heat signifies the dominance of Yang, and excessive cold indicates the foundation of Yin. Yang acts from above, and Yin operates from below. The movement of Yang is swift, while the movement of Yin is slow. Yang&#39;s essence is light, and Yin&#39;s essence is heavy. When Yin and Yang are balanced, Heaven and Earth harmonize, leading to tranquility in human energy. When Yin and Yang are out of balance, Heaven and Earth are disrupted, resulting in human energy stagnation. Hence, when Heaven obtains Yang, it burns brightly; when Earth acquires Yin, it becomes cold. Yang begins in the early hours and ends after noon; Yin commences after noon and concludes in the early hours.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The rise and fall of yin and yang occur in their respective times, continually changing without rest. A person who can follow this is indeed wise. The &quot;Essentials of the Golden Coffer&quot; says: In autumn, nourish yang; in spring, nourish yin. Do not close off yang from the outside, and do not let yin invade from the outside. Fire arises from wood, and water is born from metal; water and fire communicate and connect, each seeking the other above and below. If a person can follow this, they will never fade away—this is what is meant. Alas! How could the foolish understand this principle? Their improper actions lead to their own suffering. Externally, they are harmed by wind, cold, heat, and humidity; internally, they suffer from hunger, fullness, and labor, which exhaust the proper body and diminish the proper spirit, binding and trapping themselves, leading to life and death being laid bare. The truths of life and death lie in the balance of yin and yang. Yin energy descends and does not rise, referred to as “cutting the channels”; yang energy ascends and does not descend, called “blocking the meridians.” The evil within yin is called turbid, while the evil within yang is called clear. Fire comes to the door of the Kan (water) while water reaches the gate of Li (fire). When yin and yang correspond with each other, there is harmony.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If yin is deficient, it is replenished with water essence; if yang is deficient, it is replenished with fire essence. The balance of yin and yang accounts for various ascent and descent. The upper passage of the yang spirit is three inches, while the lower passage of the yin spirit is also three inches. Yin should often be diminished, and yang should often be augmented. Between them lies balance, where yin and yang are harmonious. Therefore, the yang within yang is granted a title by the celestial beings, while the yin within yin is named by the earthly spirits. Those who follow yin often face depletion, while those who follow yang often attain longevity. Encountering this profound essence, there is nothing that does not resonate. </p>
<p>Yin and yang are the mechanisms of heaven and earth; the five elements represent the beginning and end of yin and yang. Without yin and yang, heaven and earth cannot exist; without the five elements, yin and yang cannot manifest. Thus, human beings are formed by heaven and earth and fail through yin and yang, born from the reversals of the five elements. Heaven and earth possess yin, yang, and the five elements, just as humans possess blood vessels and vital organs.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The five elements are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; the five organs are the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, and spleen. Metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and earth generates metal, thus the cycle of generation is endless. The lungs generate the kidneys, the kidneys generate the liver, the liver generates the heart, the heart generates the spleen, and the spleen generates the lungs, nourishing each other continuously without rest. Therefore, the &quot;Golden Chamber&#39;s True Essentials&quot; states: the heart produces blood, blood is the mother of flesh; the spleen generates flesh, flesh is the dwelling of blood; the lungs relate to qi, qi is the foundation of bones; the kidneys correspond to bones, bones are the source of tendons; the liver connects to tendons, tendons are the source of blood. The five organs and five elements support and generate each other. The cycle of day and night flows continuously without beginning or end. Following this brings good fortune, while going against it brings misfortune. The relationship between heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the path of the five elements is contained within humans. Those who understand this can navigate the numbers of yin and yang, seize the opportunities of heaven and earth, and align with the essence of the five elements, achieving eternal life without beginning or end.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>On Maintaining One&#39;s Nature</strong><br><strong>By Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>Bian Que said: The Yellow Emperor remarked that water drips down day and night at a rate of a hundred kè (刻). In a single kè, a person takes one hundred thirty-five breaths; in ten kè, one thousand three hundred fifty breaths; and in one hundred kè, ten thousand three hundred fifty breaths. In a person’s life, how many breaths are there! Alas! The ancients lamented over their passing; how can one not strive to do good to nourish themselves? I have pondered that in a day and night there are twelve hours, in ten days and nights there are one hundred twenty hours, in one hundred days and nights there are one thousand two hundred hours, in one thousand days and nights there are ten thousand two hundred hours, and in ten thousand days and nights there are one hundred twenty thousand hours. This accounts for thirty years. If a long-lived person lives ninety years, they would only have three hundred sixty thousand hours. Within a hundred years, in the fleeting moments, the span of life is like that of morning mushrooms and cicadas, hardly worth mentioning. Can one neglect self-cultivation? Yet one indulges in all desires, tirelessly seeking fame and profit, employing countless deceptions and craftiness to obtain false reputation, never satisfied until death. Therefore, the one who nurtures their nature knows this: whether fame or profit, it is as if they exist or do not exist; the same applies to what is not fame or profit. Thus, they live their life without peril.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>I lament the many deviations of contemporary customs, where indulgence leads to demise. Thus, during my leisure days, I will briefly outline a treatise on nurturing one’s nature, to encourage the path of human virtues. Esteemed gentlemen of good will, join me in this cause!</p>
<p>To nurture one&#39;s nature means to cultivate it through practice; inherently, nature is good, and without practice, it is never beneficial. When nature is inherently good, inner and outer ailments will cease to manifest, and calamities and disasters will have no cause to arise. This is the great principle of nurturing one&#39;s nature. To nurture one&#39;s nature is to treat illnesses before they arise, and this is its significance. Therefore, nurturing one’s nature does not rely on medicinal pills or elixirs; it is found in the embrace of a multitude of virtuous actions. When virtuous actions are complete, though one may forsake medicine, one can enjoy longevity.</p>
<p>Without a full measure of virtue, even consuming the finest elixirs cannot prolong life. Thus, the sage says: a person who knows how to preserve life will not encounter tigers or rhinoceroses on land. This, then, points to the essence of morality; how can one rely solely on pills to wish for a long life? The reason sages developed medicines is to aid those who have strayed from the right path. Hence, the foolish cling to their ailments, year after year neglecting the cultivation of a single virtue, becoming entangled in diseases without remorse, thus they meet with the inevitable end. This is the reason for their enduring decline and final return.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Ji Kang said: There are five difficulties in nurturing life. The first is the inability to let go of fame and profit; the second is the failure to eliminate joy and anger; the third is the attachment to sound and color; the fourth is the inability to end indulgence in flavors; the fifth is the scattering of the spirit and thoughts. If these five difficulties are present, even if one’s heart wishes to escape aging, and despite reciting profound words, savoring essence, and breathing in sunlight, one cannot avoid returning to one&#39;s habits, nor can one extend one&#39;s years. If these five are absent from one’s heart, then one will naturally ascend to virtue and integrity, blessings will come without seeking goodness, and longevity will manifest without striving for it. This is the great principle of nurturing life. Yet, there may be those who uphold benevolence and righteousness without heavy burdens; or are they merely a step below?</p>
<p>Zhong Changtong said: In the palaces of kings and nobles, there are countless beautiful women; in the homes of high-ranking officials, there are hundreds of concubines. By day, they soak their bones in fine wine, and by night, they deplete their vital energy in their chambers. They listen to lewd sounds and delight in corrupt sights, never leaving their inner chambers and not returning from their external indulgences. The kings obtain this from above, and the heroes rush to follow suit from below.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>When production occurs at inopportune times, when offspring are birthed too early, whether children are too frail or if illness corrupts the essence, the vital essence is weak and the blood vessels lack sufficiency. Once born, there is no means for care or nourishment; moreover, they are steamed with cotton and refined with various flavors, causing the fetus to be damaged and the child to become sickly and delicate, unable to gain strength. If desires are indulged, they produce one another cyclically, leading to ailments that beget further ailments. When a nation lacks good doctors, and medicine lacks precise techniques, deception thrives among them, making mistakes commonplace; when an illness arises, no one can escape it. Are those who are under a hundred years old today not products of improper practices? </p>
<p>The Baopuzi says: When one questions what it means to be harmed, is it not in the realm of sexual desire? The answer is: Is this the only aspect? Yet, the essence for longevity lies in the chamber; the wise know it can lengthen life and eliminate illness, while others should not boast of themselves. If at a young age, one knows to return to the essence to nourish the mind, and gathers benefits from the usual practices, without relying on medicine, they could live one or two hundred years, but cannot achieve immortality. Those who do not grasp the techniques should refer to ancient methods, like using a water lily cup to hold wine and the feathers of a bird to contain fire.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Furthermore, forcing oneself to think beyond one&#39;s capabilities causes harm; exerting oneself beyond one&#39;s strength causes harm; deep worries and intense anger cause harm; sorrow and exhaustion cause harm; excessive joy and happiness cause harm; relentless pursuit of desires causes harm; persistent concerns and troubles cause harm; prolonged conversations and laughter cause harm; sleeping at improper times causes harm; stretching the bow and drawing the crossbow causes harm; excessive intoxication and vomiting cause harm; overeating and then lying down causes harm; running and jumping until breathless causes harm; excessive cheering and weeping cause harm. When accumulated injuries reach their peak, it leads to premature death. When it reaches such an end, it is not in accordance with the way. Therefore, those who nurture their health do not spit far, walk at a moderate pace, listen without straining, see without overstretching, sit for a limited time, stand without getting fatigued, and rest without worrying. They dress before it gets cold and remove layers before it gets hot. They do not wish to be extremely hungry before eating, nor should one eat to fullness; they do not want to be extremely thirsty before drinking, nor should one drink excessively. Overeating leads to stagnation, and excessive drinking leads to phlegm.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Do not desire excessive labor, nor excessive idleness. Do not wish to sweat, nor to spit excessively. Do not wish to rush with carriages and horses, nor to gaze far into the distance. Do not wish to consume too much raw or cold food, nor to drink alcohol in the wind. Do not wish to bathe repeatedly, nor to have broad ambitions and distant wishes. In winter, do not desire excessive warmth; in summer, do not seek extreme coolness. Do not wish to sleep exposed under the stars and moon, nor to use a fan while sleeping. Be cautious of extreme cold and heat, strong winds and fog; do not expose yourself to them. </p>
<p>Do not favor any single flavor excessively. Too much sourness harms the spleen; excessive bitterness damages the lungs; too much spiciness injures the liver; overindulgence in salt affects the heart; excessive sweetness harms the kidneys. The five flavors control the five organs; this is the principle of nature. When it is said that something causes harm, it is not immediately felt, but rather, over time, it affects longevity. Thus, those who are skilled at nurturing life have routines for waking and sleeping in harmony with the seasons, and maintain a constant balance in their activities. </p>
<p>They adjust and enable the muscles and bones with proper postures; they dispel diseases and idle evils with breathing techniques; they allow for circulation of nourishment and defense using methods for supplementation and depletion; they balance effort with rest by understanding the nature of gain and loss. They restrain anger to preserve yin and suppress joy to nurture yang. Thus, they first consume herbs and plants to remedy deficiencies, and later use elixirs to secure endlessness. The principles of nurturing one’s nature conclude here.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>To pursue desires and indulge one&#39;s sentiments, believing oneself to possess discernment and to know fate without sticking to heterodox views, and to push the limits of one&#39;s nature with ease without the effort of perseverance—upon hearing these words, it is merely like the wind passing by the ear or the lightning startling the eye, insufficient to convey understanding. Even if one&#39;s body withers in indulgence and one’s spirit fades amidst luxury, if one rejoices in it, how can one speak of nurturing one’s nature? Not only do they refuse to accept this, but they also call it an error and expect others to believe it? It is like using clear mirrors to enlighten the blind, or playing music to entertain the deaf.</p>
<p>Wei Wu summoned Huangfu Long and said: “I have heard you have reached a hundred years of age, yet your body remains strong, your hearing and sight are sharp, and your complexion is lively and pleasant—this is a remarkable thing. May I ask what you eat and what exercises you perform?” There is something worthy of being passed down; I imagine it could be sealed and shared privately. </p>
<p>Long submitted a response saying: “I have heard that of all things in heaven and earth, humanity is of greatest value. Among what people value, nothing is more precious than life. Life is chaotic and without beginning, and calamity is endless. Life happens in the midst of this, fleeting like lightning. Each time I ponder this, my heart feels greatly troubled. Life does not come again; the departed cannot be pursued. Why not suppress desires and nurture one’s nature to preserve and cherish oneself? Now that the four seas are settled and in a time of peace, one ought to display talents and virtues, aiming for a longevity of ten thousand years. Ten thousand years without end must be derived from cultivating the Way.”<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The Way is very easy to understand, but few can practice it. I have often heard that the person known as Daoist Kuai Jing is 178 years old and still very robust. He says that people should regularly consume the essence of jade spring in the morning and polish their teeth to maintain a healthy appearance, which eliminates the three pests and strengthens the teeth. The jade spring refers to saliva. Before rising in the morning, one should rinse the mouth until it is full and then swallow it; polish the teeth 27 times. This practice is called refining one’s essence.</p>
<p>The Book of Embracing Simplicity states: &quot;A person&#39;s body is like a country. The position of the chest and abdomen resembles palaces and halls; the arrangement of the limbs resembles the borders of the country; the joints are like the officials.&quot; The spirit is akin to the ruler, the blood is like the subjects, and the breath is like the people. To know how to govern oneself is to know how to govern a state. To love one&#39;s people is to secure the nation; to cherish one’s breath is to preserve one’s life. When the people disperse, the nation perishes; when the breath depletes, life ends. The dead cannot be revived, and the lost cannot be retained. Thus, the enlightened person addresses problems before they arise, treats ailments before they develop, and heals when there is no trouble, rather than waiting until after it has already passed.</p>
<p>Man is difficult to nurture yet easy to endanger; breath is hard to purify yet easy to foul. Therefore, one must be discerning in authority and virtue to protect the state; curb desires to solidify one’s health. Only then can the true unity be preserved, the spirit safeguarded, a myriad of diseases repelled, and longevity extended.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Nurturing the Nature within the Dao</strong></p>
<p>Even if one has taken herbal medicine, without knowing the art of nurturing one&#39;s nature, it is also difficult to attain long life. The way of nurturing nature requires small efforts but must avoid great fatigue and exceeding one&#39;s limits. Just as flowing water does not stagnate and the hinges of a door do not rot due to their movement, so too must one move to nurture life. </p>
<p>The way of nurturing life avoids prolonged standing, being stationary, sitting, lying down, staring, or listening. This is because prolonged staring harms the blood, lying harms the vital energy, standing harms the bones, sitting harms the flesh, and walking harms the muscles. One should also avoid overeating, overdrinking, excessively lifting weights, worry, intense anger, profound sorrow, great fear, stumbling, excessive talking, and loud laughter. </p>
<p>One should not be overly eager for desires and should not harbor resentment and hatred. All these diminish life expectancy; if one can avoid them, then longevity can be attained.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Thus, those who are adept at preserving life should always think less, contemplate less, desire less, engage in fewer matters, speak less, laugh less, worry less, enjoy less, rejoice less, get angry less, like less, and dislike less. Practicing these twelve reductions is the supreme way to nurture one’s character. Excessive thinking endangers the spirit, excessive contemplation scatters the will, excessive desire clouds the intention, excessive engagement tires the body, excessive talking depletes the energy, excessive laughter harms the organs, excessive worry frightens the heart, excessive joy overfills the consciousness, excessive rejoicing leads to confusion and mistakes, excessive anger disrupts the pulse, excessive liking causes obsession, and excessive disliking exhausts one and brings no joy. If these twelve excesses are not eliminated, then the balance of vitality and the blood will be disturbed, which jeopardizes the essence of life. Only when one transcends both excess and deficiency can one be close to the Way. Therefore, understanding not to rely on external conditions is the method for genuine practitioners at the beginning of their journey. If one can achieve this, they can dwell amidst epidemics without worry or doubt.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>After shutting out external distractions, one must guard the five inner organs: the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. One&#39;s actions and words must be upright; it is essential that thoughts do not wander into idle or delusional ideas, for if the heart is preoccupied with desires, evil thoughts will arise. Therefore, Confucius said: &quot;Think without malice.&quot; One should regularly practice the Inner Vision method of the Yellow Emperor, focusing on visualization and contemplation, ensuring that the five organs are perceived as if suspended and that the five colors are clear and distinct—this practice should not be neglected.</p>
<p>Every morning upon rising, face south, spread both hands on your knees, and observe the flow of energy moving up to the crown and down to the bubbling spring (the soles of your feet); repeat this daily; it is called &quot;welcoming the Qi.&quot; Regularly inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth in a calm and gentle manner, without opening the mouth too wide. If you wish to exhale less and inhale more, each time you eat, breathe energy into the abdomen, while the inhaled energy acts as the master. Whatever you love in your heart, do not express excessive love, and whatever you dislike, do not express excessive disdain, as both will harm your nature and spirit.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>There is no need for deep praise, nor for deep criticism. Always contemplate the equality of your heart towards things; if you sense bias, seek to correct it. If living in poverty, do not claim to be permanently poor; if living in wealth, do not claim to be permanently rich. In the midst of poverty and wealth, always uphold the path. Do not let changes in wealth alter your aspirations or character. Understanding profound principles may seem inexpressible. If you have great virtues, do not boast about them. Keep good remedies close and wise words on your lips; do not dwell on chaotic thoughts. Always approach matters with deep sincerity and respect; be cautious not to feign goodness to please others. Be virtuous throughout your life. If others dislike you, do not let hatred arise. Serve your lord with full courtesy, and if others perceive it as flattery, adjust your heart according to the way. Where the way resides, virtue is not lonely. Do not say that doing good does not bring good rewards, lest you harbor resentment. In your dwelling place, do not let your heart feel lacking; if you sense a lack, suppress it and do not allow it to grow. Those who know contentment are rewarded by heaven.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Wherever one goes, one should not seek too much; if one seeks too much, the heart becomes weary and the will increasingly suffers. The reason people are often ill is that they cannot nurture their nature. In times of health, they may indulge their desires, striving to obtain what their hearts seek, without restraint or regard for prohibitions, deceiving themselves and others, acting in every manner they wish, thinking they are true to their nature. Unbeknownst to them, in the aftermath, all these become the roots of their illnesses. When they find their hands empty and white sweat flowing out, they lament to the heavens, realizing they can grasp nothing. This is due to having been heedless throughout life, lacking self-examination, until it reaches this point. If they could take time for inner reflection, they would realize that in their actions, they fear all illnesses, and would come to understand the four hundred and four types of sickness, which they create themselves, and that these are not caused by heaven. When one day illness strikes and fails to improve, they then slander medicine as ineffective and dismiss the immortals as unresponsive.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Therefore, wise individuals who cherish their lives should reflect deeply, feel a profound sense of shame and guilt, discipline their bodies and minds, and continually cultivate good deeds. When it comes to dwelling, one should avoid extravagant luxuries; the greed and insatiability of modern people are the sources of suffering. It is best if one keeps their residence elegant, simple, and clean, without exposure to wind, rain, cold, or dampness. Clothing and utensils should not be made of precious jewels or gold; excessive indulgence leads to deep-rooted worries. Meals should not be abundant with rich meats; a frugal lifestyle is preferable. Then one can walk like a majestic swan, speak as if resonating with a bell, and sleep like a lion. Each day, one should sing: &quot;Delicious food must be chewed well; do not swallow raw food without savoring.&quot; In my dwelling place, it’s a large house surrounded by forests and villages. By nurturing vitality and guarding the five organs, one&#39;s energy may reach the bones, achieving a form of immortality. Additionally, one should sing: &quot;Three forms of poison are consumed each day; if not chewed, they will dissolve by themselves.&quot; Embellishments are for the five organs; one dresses in humble garments. Having a calm mind, one must also speak cautiously.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Whenever speaking or reciting, one should often contemplate the voice residing in the lower energy center (just below the navel). Each day, upon first entering, one should avoid speaking or reciting until dawn. When rising at dawn, one should focus on discussing virtuous matters, avoiding any concerns about money first. Furthermore, one should not speak while eating; those who do often suffer from chest and back pain. It is also advised not to engage in excessive talking or laughter while lying down; if one cannot remain silent in bed, the internal organs are likened to bells or chimes, which cannot resonate if not suspended properly. Speaking while walking is discouraged; if speech is necessary, one should pause and then speak, as speaking while moving can lead to a loss of energy. On the Winter Solstice, one may speak but should refrain from excessive conversation. When someone inquires, one should not refuse to answer, but one should also avoid unnecessary speech. Furthermore, one should avoid exposure to cold and prefer to speak with intention. Once one&#39;s speech is cautious, it is best to moderate food and drink. Therefore, those who nurture their nature wisely eat when hungry and drink when thirsty.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>When appetite is limited and one desires not to eat much at once, it becomes difficult to digest. One often seeks to feel as if one is full while still being hungry, or hungry while still feeling full. For fullness can harm the lungs, while hunger can sap energy; salty flavors may harm the tendons, and sour flavors can affect the bones. Therefore, one should generally practice a light diet, ensuring that food is well-chewed so that the rice essence enters the stomach, and not let the essence of wine enter the intestines. When one eats, it is essential to remove worries. Consuming the five flavors should not lead to excessive anger, as this can easily disturb the spirit and cause restless dreams at night. One should not indulge in heavy meats, which often lead to various ailments. It is advisable to eat less meat, more rice, and a small amount of vegetables, while avoiding raw vegetables, raw rice, spoiled beans, and unclean things, and not to drink murky wines or eat dough that blocks the airways. Raw meat should not be consumed as it can damage the stomach. All meat should be thoroughly cooked and allowed to cool before eating. After eating, one should rinse the mouth several times to prevent dental decay and maintain fresh breath. Rinsing the mouth with cold vinegar after eating hot food can result in foul breath and dental issues.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>After consuming hot foods and salty items, one should not drink cold vinegar or thin water, as this can lead to losing one&#39;s voice and throat constriction. When sweating from hot foods, do not expose yourself to the wind, as it can cause spasms and headaches, leading to watery eyes and excessive sleepiness. After finishing a meal, one should rub their face and abdomen with their hands to help the flow of bodily fluids. After eating, it is important to walk about casually, and if one walks several miles, then having someone massage the abdomen hundreds of times can aid digestion, greatly benefiting one’s health and allowing for the enjoyment of food without illness. Eating until full and then lying down can lead to various ailments, causing food to stagnate and accumulate. Lying on one&#39;s back after a full meal can result in a gas-filled stomach, leading to headaches. Exposure to cold after consuming hot food can give rise to colds. One should not eat at night, nor should one overindulge in food and drink at night. Avoid excessive contemplation while eating. Engaging in laborious tasks is harmful, draining one&#39;s energy.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>One must eat before the sun reaches the hour of the snake; then there is no need to drink alcohol, and one will be free from nausea for life. Do not eat the flesh associated with your parents&#39; birth fate, as it shortens one&#39;s life. Do not eat the flesh associated with your own birth fate, as it causes the soul to drift away. Avoid all brains, as they greatly harm a person. If rain seeps into a thatched hut and falls on preserved meats, consuming them leads to lumps in the body. Fresh meat that has not been properly dried is harmful. Eating meat from offerings made to deities that moves on its own is detrimental. If insects are found in food, do not consume it, as it is toxic. If one has a chronic illness, do not eat carp or catfish, as they cause harm. Foods that are damp or trodden upon by someone and are not visibly affected should not be eaten, as it leads to sudden conditions. If one feels abdominal swelling after eating, medicine should be taken promptly. Eat malva every ten days, as it helps to relieve the blockage of the five viscera and is a leading vegetable; there’s no need to combine it with other foods for better effects.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>When drinking alcohol, one should not overindulge; if one drinks too much, it&#39;s better to vomit it up. Avoid getting drunk, as it can lead to lifelong ailments. Prolonged drinking can rot the intestines and stomach, seep into the marrow and muscles, harm the spirit, and reduce lifespan. When drunk, do not face the wind or the sun, as it can drive one to madness; also, do not lie in the wind or be fanned, as this can lead to illness. When intoxicated, do not sleep exposed or among millet, or you may develop sores. Do not force yourself to eat while drunk, or you may develop boils, lose your voice, or get sores. Being drunk and overly full, one should not attempt to ride in a vehicle or jump around. Furthermore, do not engage in intimate relations while drunk and overly full; minor issues may lead to coughing, while major ones may damage organs and threaten life. When a person feels the urge to urinate while hungry, they should sit; if they feel full, they should stand. Be cautious to avoid sickness. Additionally, holding in urine can lead to coldness in the knees and numbness, while holding in a bowel movement can lead to hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Do not strain while urinating, as it may cause coldness in the legs and knees; when defecating, do not use force or hold your breath, as this can lead to lower back pain and eye issues—allow it to happen naturally. Whenever encountering springs in valleys or mountainous areas, do not stay long or eat regularly there, as it may lead to goiter disease. Moreover, avoid drinking cold water from deep, shady places, as it can cause epidemic fevers. Eat and drink in moderation, and be mindful of dressing appropriately for the weather. </p>
<p>When a person rises in the morning, if they dress in reverse, it is auspicious to wear it that way. For bright clothes, they should be shaken three times at the entrance, saying &quot;misfortune be gone,&quot; which is auspicious. Wet or sweaty clothes should not be worn for long, as they may lead to sores and skin itchiness. If one sweats profusely, it is best to change clothes; if that is not possible, wash them promptly, or it may result in urinary difficulties. In cases of heavy sweating, do not only remove clothes from one side, as this could invite half- winds and cause one side of the body to become paralyzed. </p>
<p>In spring, do not wear thin clothing, as it may result in colds and digestive issues. After changing clothes, one should adjust their sleeping environment accordingly. Generally, during sleep, one should face east in spring and summer, and west in autumn and winter. The head should not face north, nor should the bed be positioned against the north wall. When about to sleep, do not sing or chant, as it invites misfortune.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>When getting into bed, first remove your left foot. Do not lie directly on your back with your spine exposed. After lying down, do not leave lamps or candles burning, as they disturb the spirit and the six senses, leading to excessive sorrow and resentment. Do not place a stove by your head, as prolonged exposure can generate heat, causing heaviness in the head, red eyes, and a dry nose. At night, ensure there are no drafts blowing into your ears, as this may lead to deafness. In summer, do not sleep with your face exposed, as it can cause thickening of the skin, lead to scabs, or create facial wind. In winter nights, do not cover your head, for it leads to longevity. Generally, when sleeping, do not let your feet hang over the edge, as this can cause kidney issues and damage to reproductive health. If your feet are cold, avoid sleeping along a straight wall over extended distances, as cold winds can disturb your mind; heavy-bodied individuals should not dangle their feet while sleeping, as this can lead to blood stasis and lower back pain. Additionally, avoid sleeping during the day, as it can cause depletion of vital energy. Do not speak loudly while lying down, as it can deplete your strength.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>At dusk, it is customary to keep the mouth closed; if it opens, one loses energy. Furthermore, evil enters through the mouth, leading over time to thirst and a loss of vitality. Lying on one&#39;s side with knees bent benefits one’s energy and is superior to lying flat. Confucius prohibited lying flat, hence it is said that sleep should not be overly constrained, and waking should not be excessively stretched. For an ordinary person, sleeping soundly can attract ghosts and evils. When sleeping, one should first settle the heart, then the eyes. During a night’s sleep, one should spend time turning over five times, constantly shifting positions. If one is suddenly awakened by a light in the night, it is certain death; if called in darkness, it is also ill to respond hastily. Nightmares should not be mentioned; in the morning, one should splash water towards the east and chant: &quot;May bad dreams turn to grass and trees, and good dreams turn to precious jade,&quot; thus avoiding misfortune. Additionally, whether dreams are good or bad, do not mention them as auspicious. Clothing, food, and dwelling should all be appropriate, adapting to the seasonal energy, which is the essence of the way to nurture life. Therefore, those who are good at preserving life do not transgress the taboos of the sun and moon and do not disrupt the harmony of the seasons.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>One must observe a day&#39;s abstinence and not feast in the evening; a month&#39;s abstinence and not get drunk on the last day; a year&#39;s abstinence and not travel far in the evening; and a lifetime&#39;s abstinence and not engage in candlelit activities in the evening, continually protecting one&#39;s vital energy. The vital energy begins at winter solstice, rising from the Yongquan point; in November, it reaches the knees, in December, the thighs, and in May, the waist, known as the formation of the three Yangs. In February, it reaches the heel; in March, the neck; in April, the crown — the pure Yang takes action. The Yin follows a similar pattern. Therefore, in the months of April and October, one should refrain from going into the bedroom, avoiding the use of Yin and Yang during these months of pure activity. Every winter solstice, one should lie on thick grass laid out on the northern wall, as it is said to absorb the original energy. After the first day of August, one should use a mild fire to warm the feet, not allowing the lower body to cool unfavorably — one always wishes for the energy to remain low, not to dissipate upward. In early spring, before the thaw, clothing should be thick at the bottom and thin at the top.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Nourish yang and conserve yin, to perpetuate life and ensure longevity; nourish yin and conserve yang, leads to ruin and destruction. Therefore, it is said that during winter, the energies of heaven and earth are closed, and the blood and vital energy are concealed. One should not exert oneself to the point of sweating, as it releases yang energy and can be detrimental to health. It is also said that during winter, the brain can freeze; in spring and autumn, both the brain and body can be frozen—this is the constant practice of the sages. </p>
<p>In spring, one should rise early and lie down late; in summer and autumn, one should stay up late before retiring; in winter, one should go to bed early and get up late, all of which are beneficial. Although one may say to rise early, it should not be before the rooster crows; and although one may say to rise late, it should not be after sunrise. </p>
<p>Whenever there is an unexpected heat during the winter months or an unexpected chill during the summer months, one should not expose oneself. Those who suffer from climatic disturbances do so because they violate these principles. One must regulate one&#39;s breathing and balance the cold and heat to avoid afflictions. </p>
<p>On the days of the winter solstice, do not sing or dance; those who do so will surely face calamity. Always burn white hair on the first day of the first month for good fortune. On the first day of the tiger (Yin), cut your fingernails; on the first day of the horse (Wu), cut your toenails, and also burn white hair for good fortune.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Residence Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>For anyone&#39;s living space, it must be well-sealed; do not allow any small gaps that wind might enter through. If you feel even a slight draft, do not force yourself to remain seated for long; you must urgently seek to avoid it. Prolonged exposure without noticing can lead to a stroke. Historically, sudden gusts of wind have caused limbs to become unresponsive, creating conditions where one cannot speak or may feel as if their body is bending back like a bow. All of this results from neglecting this issue. Once afflicted by wind, many ailments can converge, and the presence of harmful energies can lead to sudden death in nine out of ten cases. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain thorough precautions; do not take this lightly. Exercise extreme care! Additionally, ensure your living space does not block wells and waterways, as this can cause deafness and blindness.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>When at home or outdoors, if one is caught in a great storm with strong winds and heavy rain, thunder and lightning, dense darkness and fog, this is caused by the movements of various dragons, spirits, and deities. It is advisable to enter a room, close the doors, burn incense, sit quietly, and find peace to avoid danger, waiting for the storm to pass before venturing out; otherwise, it will harm people. Though one might not suffer at the moment, later repercussions could arise. Also, it is inadvisable to travel far in foggy weather.</p>
<p>In a household with sacred images, one should first bow to them before bowing to elders; whenever one moves, sit up straight and proper.</p>
<p>In general, one should not bathe frequently at home. If one must bathe, it should be done in a private room; the water should not be too hot or too cold, or it could lead to numerous ailments. In winter, bathing should not necessarily induce heavy sweating; after bathing, one must avoid exposure to cold winds. After washing one&#39;s hair, one should not be exposed to wind, should not wet their hairstyle, nor allow their head to be damp while lying down, as this can cause dizziness, baldness, darkened complexion, toothaches, hearing loss, and dandruff. It is advised not to bathe when hungry or to bathe after a full meal. After bathing, one should eat a small amount before going out. Bathing at night without eating will lead to restlessness, excessive sweating, and vivid dreams.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Husbands and wives should not bathe on the same day; it is customary to bathe on the days of the new moon and waning moon, which is auspicious. If one uses water from cooking soup overnight to wash, it can cause skin ailments; washing the face can lead to a loss of luster, and washing the feet can result in pain and sores. Washing the head with hot water and then rinsing with cold can lead to headaches. Drinking water while washing the head can also cause headaches. During times of illness, when one is sweating and recovering, do not wash with cold water, as it can harm the heart and not allow recovery.</p>
<p>In general, it is advised for those at home to be cautious: if there is any displeasure among family members, they should speak up early and not endure silently, thinking it is a minor issue; if it is left unaddressed, it may worsen into a serious condition. For minor discomforts, gentle massage can help relieve tension and expel pathogenic energy. People should not wait to be asked about matters, and should make it a habit to daily stretch and press the back and limbs once; if the head and neck are well cared for, then seasonal wind and sickness cannot invade a person.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>This essential knowledge is profound and cannot be fully elaborated. For people at home or traveling, they should always carry one sheng of familiar mugwort, emergency pills, and antidote pills, as well as skin-repairing medicine, moistening medicine, and treatments for swelling, along with mercury, rhubarb, Glauber&#39;s salt, licorice, dried ginger, cinnamon, and Sichuan pepper. No additional medicines should be stored; these items must not be lacking. One or two rolls of emergency prescriptions should also be carried, along with antidotes for venomous snakes, scorpions, and bees.</p>
<p>When a person has been healthy for ten days or more, they must perform moxibustion on several acupoints to release wind and regulate qi. Daily adjustments in breathing and practices of massage and guided exercises are ideal. Do not take good health for granted, as one should always remain cautious of danger. This is to prevent various illnesses. Moxibustion must avoid contact with others. One should perform it with careful attention to manual strength and not overstrain. In spring and autumn, one must take purging medicine at least once, to avoid issues caused by seasonal changes.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Dietary Method</strong></p>
<p>For ordinary people: in spring, take five doses of the small longevity elixir and one dose each of various nourishing powders; in summer, during great heat, take three doses of kidney infusion; in autumn, take one to two doses of pills made from astragalus and similar herbs; in winter, take two to three doses of medicinal wine, but stop on the day of the onset of spring. If this method is followed throughout one’s life, then one will not fall ill. Common people see superficially; they only know the harmful effects of certain poisonous plants but do not believe in the longevity benefits of huangqi (astragalus); they only recognize grains as a remedy for hunger and do not understand the life-saving properties of myriad herbs; they only know how to use purgatives for fertility, but cannot grasp the need for consolidation and nourishment, hence the necessity for using dietary methods. Qi Yi said: When it comes to diet, one should seek what is appropriate according to nature, carefully considering the suitability of cold and heat; one cannot simply follow what seems powerful and take it without discernment. Initially, medicinal herbs should prioritize plants, then stones, establishing the foundational principles of using medicines. This is about alternating the refined and the coarse, graduating from the coarse to the refined.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>A person from youth to adulthood cultivates the essence of the five grains and cannot suddenly abandon them. When taking medicine, if the benefits are slow and subtle, it will not satisfy hunger. However, through many years of consistency, one can strengthen their bones and marrow, allowing the grains to naturally become effective. Nowadays, many people expect immediate results and seek quick fixes; when their internal organs are not well-nourished, they abruptly stop eating, diminish the essence of the grains, and the medicine has no effect. They then turn to women, becoming no different from the common folk, leading to their demise—this should not be surprising! The principles of taking medicine must follow a certain order. Those who do not understand this method not only suffer harm but also ultimately fail to gain strength. Therefore, in the proper method of taking medicine, one must first eliminate the three pests; after eliminating the three pests, one can then take herbal medicine; once the medicinal strength is properly absorbed, one can take wood-based medicine; after gaining strength from that, one can then take stone-based medicine. Following this order allows one to fully realize the properties of the medicine, ensuring stability in health and potentially prolonging life.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Yellow Emperor&#39;s Miscellaneous Taboos</strong></p>
<p>Upon rising in the morning, do not open your eyes to wash your face; this can cause eye irritation, loss of sight, and excessive tearing. In the early morning, speak only good words and avoid wicked speech. If you hear bad news, immediately spit three times towards the direction from which it came, which will be auspicious. Do not become angry, shout, or sigh, nor should you sing lamentations, as these are said to invite misfortune. Do not sit kneeling with your arms crossed over your knees, and do not let your hair cover your face, for both are inauspicious. Do not point your feet at the fire, nor curse at the stove. In all actions of standing or sitting, do not turn your back to the sun; this is auspicious. Do not sit facing north for a long time in contemplation, as it brings misfortune. Whenever you travel, always keep the North Star above your head; this ensures good fortune in all directions. If you intend to go to war, keep a fighting posture aimed at the enemy, which is auspicious. Do not wear a hat facing north, as this is ominous. Do not spit towards the northwest, as it offends the deity of the North Star, also ominous. Do not cough or spit unnecessarily, as this can lead to lung disease, heaviness in the limbs, and back pain. Also, do not urinate or defecate toward the northwest. Do not kill turtles or snakes. Do not glare at the sun or moon, as this is known to cause blindness. When walking or riding a horse, avoid looking back, for it causes the spirit to depart. A person should not travel in a ghostly manner.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Whenever passing a temple, one must be cautious and not enter carelessly. If one does enter, it must be with respect, and one should not gaze about indiscriminately, as if before a stern lord; then one may partake of its blessings. If not, one will quickly encounter misfortune. One must also not look back at the temple. If one suddenly sees dragons or serpents, do not become agitated or curious, nor pay attention to them. If one unexpectedly sees strange or monstrous beings, suppress any feeling of surprise; do not be alarmed. There is a saying: &quot;To see the strange without surprise will cause the strangeness to fade.&quot; </p>
<p>Furthermore, while traveling or among crowds, if you see extraordinarily beautiful women, be careful not to gaze too intently or fall in love; these may be spirits that lead one to deep infatuation. This applies equally in remote mountains, wilderness, or in crowded areas. In places where sand or leeches are found in water, do not bathe there, as it can be harmful. To cross, follow after donkeys or horses swiftly, as this does not bring harm. Where there are water traps, if one shoots at a person&#39;s shadow, they will die; those wishing to cross water should strike the water with an object so that the trap disperses, allowing for a safe crossing.</p>
<p>In all mountains with holes or cavities, treasure hunters should only enter during the third or ninth months; in other months, the mountains close off their energy, and to trespass will lead to death. Under no circumstances should a person with an empty stomach look upon a corpse, as the foul odor will enter their nostrils, causing a white coating on their tongue and a persistent bad smell. Those who wish to see a corpse must only do so after drinking alcohol, as it helps ward off the poisonous effects. When encountering heat while traveling, do not wash your face in the river, as it will lead to darkening of the skin.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Maintaining Life</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Internal Canon&quot; states that one should follow the principles of yin and yang, harmonize with techniques and numbers, moderate eating and drinking, and maintain a regular schedule. Avoid excessive labor so that body and spirit remain together, allowing one to live to the end of their allotted years, departing only after a hundred. However, modern people are different; they consider wine as their staple, treat fantasies as reality, enter rooms intoxicated, deplete their essence through desire, and squander their true nature. They do not understand moderation, fail to manage their spirit in a timely manner, strive for momentary pleasure, and live without a schedule, resulting in decline by middle age.</p>
<p>Diet and daily routines are fundamental to a person&#39;s life practice. It is indeed difficult to want to maintain vitality and harmony with nature while indulging in excess and lacking moderation. The text also states: when food intake is excessive, it harms the intestines and stomach; a disturbed daily routine leads to a restless mind.</p>
<p>Therefore, sages align with the seasons—spring brings vitality, assisted by fragrant oils for the stomach; summer&#39;s fire thrives, aided by aromatic meats for the lungs. In autumn, one should consume oils and pungent foods to support the liver; during winter, warming foods should be consumed to nourish the heart. This is to assist that which is weakened.</p>
<p>Thus, the regularity of food and drink is essential for sustaining life. The key components are the five grains, five fruits, five animals, and five vegetables. The spleen and stomach rely on these for nourishment, the three burners require them for smooth passage, the channels of energy depend on them for clarity and impurity, and the bones and muscles need them for flexibility and strength. Therefore, the text concludes: the harmony of the five flavors prevents damage to the five organs, which is crucial for nourishing the body.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>Although the five flavors nourish the body, if the flavor is too sour, it affects the liver&#39;s energy and the spleen&#39;s energy will be depleted; if the flavor is too salty, it exhausts the bones and muscles, and depresses the heart&#39;s energy; if the flavor is too sweet, it causes the heart to become congested, leading to a dark complexion and imbalanced kidney energy; if the flavor is too bitter, it dries out the spleen&#39;s energy and thickens the stomach&#39;s energy; if the flavor is too pungent, it weakens the tendons, and the spirit becomes weak. This is what is meant by losing the proper balance of the five flavors and damaging the body. Wang&#39;s commentary says: flavors can have excessive strengths, and organs can have excessive weaknesses. This is what it refers to. Diet nourishes the body, while daily activities regulate the spirit.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Therefore, the sage sleeps at night in early spring and rises early, allowing his hair to flow freely, observing the time of the hair&#39;s growth, and says this fosters vitality. In early summer, he again sleeps at night and rises early, not being weary of the sun, observing the flourishing time, and says this allows the mind to remain tranquil and the energy to diffuse. In early autumn, he sleeps early and rises early, waking with the rooster, observing the time of harmonious balance, gathering his spirit and energy, and says this brings peace to the mind, in response to the autumn atmosphere. In early winter, he sleeps early and rises late, moving away from the cold towards warmth, observing the time of closing and storing, and says this keeps the mind concealed, as if having private intentions or personal gains. This follows the path of growth, storage, and conservation. In spring and summer, one nourishes the yang, while in autumn and winter, one nourishes the yin. By following the natural rhythms of the four seasons in daily life, one adjusts their spirit. The classics state that going against the spring energies leads to a deficiency in yang, causing liver energies to stagnate; going against the summer energies causes a deficiency in yang, leading to disturbances in heart energy; going against the autumn energies results in failing to gather yin, causing lung energies to become overwhelmed; going against the winter energies fails to preserve yin, causing kidney energies to plunge. This neglect of the seasonal energies damages the spirit. The wise follow the rhythms of the four seasons, not contradicting the principles of yin and yang, and do not lose the harmonious balance of the five flavors. Thus, both body and spirit endure for a long time, allowing them to fully spend their allotted years. Those who hasten their hearts and go against the joy of living have no need to discuss this path! Therefore, the sage practices this, the wise cherish it; is it not profound wisdom?<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>An Essay on Nourishing the Heart and Regulating the Spleen and Stomach</strong></p>
<p>The secret texts state: The heart is the ruler&#39;s office, from which the spirit emerges. All emotions such as joy, anger, vexation, sorrow, worry, thought, fear, and dread deplete vital energy. The excessive fire of yin arises from the heart&#39;s stagnation, which is due to the instability of the seven emotions. The heart is the dwelling of the spirit; if the lord of the heart does not guard it, it transforms into fire. Fire is the thief of the seven spirits, hence it is said that excessive yin fire disrupts the nourishing energy of the spirit, leading to pulse disorders. When the spirit is un-nourished, the fluids do not circulate, thus blood vessels cannot generate blood. The spirit of the human heart is also known as true energy; it thrives on blood, and when blood flourishes, the pulse becomes vigorous. The pulse is the dwelling of the spirit; if the heart suffers stagnation, the seven spirits will deviate, and the pulse will contain only fire. To effectively treat this condition, one must harmonize the spleen and stomach, allowing the heart to be free of stagnation. Whether through experiencing joy, favorable events, gentler weather, residing in a moderate environment, enjoying delicious food, or encountering desirable sights, one can feel as if there is no ailment, due to the relaxation of vital energy in the stomach.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Regulation of the Spleen and Stomach</strong></p>
<p>One should avoid eating when angry. It is not advisable to be too full or too hungry. Meals should be well-balanced and warm, with a preference for grains over meat, and it&#39;s best to avoid meat juices. Cold and damp foods should be avoided as they hinder the growth of muscle. The yang energy may become dormant, leading to fatigue and pain in the limbs; during rainy weather, this can result in diarrhea and dysentery with white pus and blood, or bloody diarrhea disease. This is due to the stagnation of yang energy not flowing properly. </p>
<p>Excessive exertion weakens yang energy, so leisure activities like riding or traveling are encouraged; however, one should rest if faced with wind or cold. Proper balance in movement and rest is essential; one should not become overly fatigued. On sunny, warm days, warm baths are beneficial, but do not use excessively hot water that induces heavy sweating. </p>
<p>Avoid eating or drinking in a state of exhaustion; even if hungry or thirsty, one should rest first. Only eat or drink when feeling adequately rested, and limit activity after eating.

<p>Which is closer, name or body? Which is greater, body or wealth? If the beads of the Duke of Sui are used to strike sparrows soaring thousands of feet, the world will surely laugh. Why take the light and discard the heavy? At sixty-five, my frail body has lost half of its ability to see and hear, my blood vessels are agitated and my mind is troubled. My body drifts like debris, and when my eyes close, my spirit seems to drift away like a wave. My vitality is weaker than before, and my appetite has decreased from what it used to be. I merely respond to human affairs, and my ailments only worsen. Is what I possess any less than the Duke of Sui’s pearls? I find peace in simplicity, think less and desire little, speak sparingly to nurture my spirit, refrain from engaging in vain labor to sustain my form, keep an open heart to maintain my spirit. Whether longevity or early death, I accept it all as fate; gains and losses are trivial. When blood and energies are naturally balanced, there is no room for ill, and how can ailments worsen? If I can hold onto this, I might approach the Dao, and can be said to have grasped its true essence.</p>

<p><strong>Treating the Unmanifested Illness Rather than the Manifested One</strong></p>
<p>It is better to nurture health before illness arises than to treat a condition once it has developed. Once the sickness has taken hold and medicine is applied, it is usually in vain. Therefore, not treating existing illnesses serves as a caution for physicians; treating before the onset of illness elucidates the principles of health preservation. Thus, if one considers potential problems and takes preventive measures, what worries could there be? This encapsulates the wise approach of not treating existing ailments but addressing the potential for illness.</p>
<p>For instance, preparing soil to prevent water: if one does not block its flowing streams, a surging flood cannot be contained. Preparing water to combat fire: if one does not extinguish its flickering flames, the wildfire cannot be stopped. If even the overflowing water or raging fire cannot be tamed, how can one expect to treat an already established illness? Therefore, it is advisable to sleep early and rise with the dawn in the spring, and to rise early and sleep late in the summer, allowing the body to remain relaxed, avoiding anger and fulfilling one&#39;s intentions, providing cool and cold food to nourish one&#39;s Yang. This is how the wise treat the unmanifested illness in spring and summer. In the autumn, one should rise with the chickens and await the hidden sun in winter to conserve one’s spirit and harbor one’s intentions, providing warm and heated food to nourish one’s Yin. This is how the wise treat the unmanifested illness in autumn and winter.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Some say that when one observes disease of the liver, one must first address the weakness of the spleen; only then can the wood pathogen be prevented from spreading. When one sees redness in the right cheek, one must first purge the heat from the lung channels; only then can the metal pathogen be restrained. This is indeed the method of treating illness before it arises.</p>
<p>Now, to cultivate the spirit in accordance with the four seasons to prevent illness—what does this mean? It is the way of the sage to preserve life; it is the mark of the superior craftsman to treat illness thoroughly. The idea of treating the unmanifested disease before it manifests is elaborated in the &quot;Treatise on the Harmonization of the Four Qi.&quot; How insightful it is!</p>
<p>In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and the Celestial Master exchanged questions and answers, always prioritizing cultivation and care. They first discussed the nature of heaven, followed by the harmonization of the spirit. Once aligned with yin and yang, they then emphasized the adjustment to the four qi. They spoke of moderation in food and drink, and also emphasized consistency in daily routines. The earnest emphasis on nurturing life is intended to address potential ailments before they develop into serious conditions.</p>
<p>Later, Qin observed a noble from Jin with a disease in the diaphragm and advised, “It is beyond remedy!” Bian Que, understanding this principle, viewed the Duke of Qi&#39;s affliction as reaching the very marrow and declared, “It is beyond saving!” Alas, how unfortunate that the lords of Qi and Jin failed to grasp the principles of preventing illnesses before they manifest?<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Aptitudes on Food and Drink</strong></p>
<p>The value of the human body lies in the physical form bestowed by parents. Damaging the body for the sake of the mouth is rampant. While possessing this body, hunger and thirst arise based on desires. Thus, one engages in eating and drinking to sustain life. Those who indulge are often ignorant, leading to a lack of restraint in taste. Excess in flavors brings forth diseases. The emergence of illness is subtle and difficult to detect. Under the pull of gluttony, one suddenly loses focus. When illness becomes established, both food and drink are abandoned. This brings worry to parents, and despite numerous remedies, healing remains a struggle. In poverty and isolation, simplicity is well understood. If action remains unwavering, the body can also remain healthy. When air and essence are balanced, I alone suffer from ailments. Upon the awakening of regret, dust clears and the mirror is purified. It emphasizes moderation in eating and drinking, easy to say but hard to practice. Nurturing trivial matters can lead to grave losses, as Mencius remarked. The mouth can cause illness and also undermine virtue. Guarding one&#39;s mouth like a sealed bottle ensures there is no disarray.</p>
<p><strong>Aptitudes on Desire</strong></p>
<p>The essence of human life is intertwined with heaven and earth. The feminine principle emerges from the earth, while the masculine form arises from heaven. Together they become husband and wife, with reproduction as their purpose. In youth, blood and qi are vigorous; this is the prime of life. Formality governs the relationship, and timing is essential. The bond between parent and child hinges on this understanding. Yet, those who are ignorant indulge in lust without restraint. Fearing they may miss out, they are further driven by impulsive desires. Qi corresponds to yang and blood corresponds to yin – they are the spirit of the human body. When yin is balanced with secretive yang, my body embraces eternal spring. How can there be ample blood and qi without self-cultivation? What was meant for my sustenance becomes my downfall. Women in their indulgence possess many desires. In the serenity of the boudoir and harmony of the household, they flourish. Men in their indulgence, however, may bring ruin to their homes. Having lost their virtue, their bodies also wither. It is essential to distance oneself from temptation; only then can the mind find peace. When food and drink are delightful, the body thrives and illness recedes.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>Discourse on Eating Light Foods</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: The Inner Canon states that if essence is insufficient, it should be supplemented with flavor, and also mentions that the earth feeds people with the five flavors. In ancient times, at fifty, people consumed meat; now, at seventy, my son completely abstains from salt. Is this not taking the middle path? Why does my son possess such vitality and complexion? </p>
<p>He answered: There are flavors bestowed by heaven and those cultivated by man. The flavors bestowed by heaven, such as grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits, have a naturally harmonious taste and the ability to nourish and replenish the yin, which is what the Inner Canon refers to as flavor. The flavors cultivated by humans are mostly overly rich and heavily seasoned, which can be harmful and detrimental to one&#39;s life—this is the flavor you doubt. </p>
<p>Now, to refuse salt and strong seasonings is not truly to eat lightly. The salty taste of barley and millet, the sweetness of glutinous rice and yam, the pungent flavors of scallion and garlic, are all flavors. Do you consider them to be light? Those who are content with natural flavors have tranquility in their heart and a cooling of their fire; those who find security in rich flavors pursue excessive desires and have an overactive fire. What is there to doubt? </p>
<p>The Inner Canon also states: The yin emerges primarily from the five flavors. Are these not heavenly bestowed flavors? The five organs of the yin suffer from the five flavors. Are these not human-made flavors? The sages made provisions to guard against these things. When a person is hungry, they must eat. The glutinous rice, which is sweet yet light, embodies the virtues of the earth, and being fundamentally related to yin, is the most nourishing; it should only be consumed alongside vegetables.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>Those who use vegetables as sustenance may, in times of hunger, suddenly overindulge or worry about overeating, which may lead to stomach damage. Therefore, vegetables assist in nourishment, facilitating digestion and ease—this is the benevolence of nature. The Analects say: “Though meat is plentiful, it should not overpower the spirit of eating.” The commentary mentions: “With host and guest bowing a hundred times and three rounds of wine, one avoids the perils of wine.” This reflects the teachings of the sages. Indeed, grains and rich meats are best consumed together. When one accumulates rich flavors without grains over time, do they not assist the inner fire and create toxicity? Therefore, those who eat while avoiding grains can do so, but those who do not avoid grains while eating will inevitably succumb to their toxicity. The Inner Canon states that prolonged illness depletes vital energy, which is the norm of transformation; when energy increases over time, it leads to premature death. Those who are accustomed to rich flavors seldom reflect on this. If one asks why flavor compensates for insufficient essence rather than saying it replenishes energy, the reply is: flavor represents yin; energy represents yang. To replenish essence is to seek its root, hence it is supplemented with flavor. Herbs like licorice, white atractylodes, rehmannia, alisma, schisandra, and asparagine are all rich in flavor. The scripture states, “Supplement the deficient,” which aligns with this understanding. The previous text suggests that when the body is deficient, it is invigorated with energy. Exhaustion causes depletion of energy, hence deficiency. Warming is nurturing; it preserves life and allows energy to replenish. When energy is abundant, the body is complete. Thus, it speaks of warmth without mentioning supplementation. The scripture states, “Those who are fatigued should be warmed,” which is precisely this intention. Those who follow the “Classical Formulas” do not realize this; all signs of deficiency are treated with warming and supplementary herbs, termed “warming supplementation,” yet they fail to grasp the true meaning of the scriptures.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>Medical Introduction by Li Chan (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Discussion on Health Maintenance<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>The physician must cultivate virtue and cherish one&#39;s own spirit; this is where the difficulty in healing lies. If the spirit is depleted, perception will be impaired, and the appropriate medicine cannot be administered; even with a heart to help others, one&#39;s strength will be insufficient. If a patient finds that medicine or acupuncture is ineffective, it is usually because they do not know how to preserve their health. As the ancients said, &quot;It is better to protect oneself before falling ill than to take medicine after becoming sick.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Danxi, the works on nourishing the mind and calming the fire, one should observe the condition of the sick person at that time. Some may debate the preference for gentle nourishment, but they overlook that its true intention is for those with phlegm, fire, and yin deficiency. When a person reaches middle age, kidney energy diminishes day by day, and with indulgence in desires, they become weak. Taking Yang-replenishing tonics may lead to overwhelming heat. While temporarily consuming nourishing descent drugs may provide a sense of refreshment, over time they can worsen one&#39;s vitality and blood. Therefore, one must adjust their diet, avoiding all fried, roasted, alcoholic, vinegar, fermented, and dry heat-inducing foods to prevent drying out the blood; also, avoiding all icy fruits and seasonal vegetables to protect the spleen. </p>
<p>If one can consume mild and light food, the foundation of the five flavors will sufficiently replenish the five organs. This applies to caring for the elderly and nurturing the young. Consumption of meat and alcohol can bolster yang and stoke fire, causing internal injury and exhaustion. Those with weak vital energy, even if ill, should temporarily consume such foods to benefit the stomach, as noted by Dongyuan. However, moderation in diet is extremely difficult; not only meat and alcohol, but also etiquette and restraint must not be overstretched. Even rice and porridge should not be consumed to saturation; there’s a saying, “If you can eat three bowls, only eat two.&quot; Confucius stated, “Even with an abundance of meat, do not let it overpower your appetite.&quot;<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>A brief note states: If the fleshly desires dominate, they obstruct the vital energy; if the vital energy dominates, it obstructs the original Qi. Those whose vital energy flows will have longevity, while those whose vital energy is stagnant will die young. Only wine in moderation does not lead to chaos; for the sage, it is acceptable, but common people should first know their limits to avoid disorder. Restraint in desires is not just about what is visually appealing or physically alluring; indulging in excess disrupts proper relationships and contradicts fundamental principles, offending the heavens, earth, and spirits. Even with one&#39;s own wife or concubines, one should not engage in reckless unions. Great winds, heavy rains, extreme heat, and severe cold, especially during the new and full moons, should be approached with caution and restraint. Only in stillness can one nurture insights and naturally alter one&#39;s heart. All vile and lewd acts should be abhorred, let alone one who would greedily covet and lose precious family treasures! When asked about nurturing and self-cultivation, the response is: there is not much distinction between them.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The cultivation of the self pertains to distant realms beyond ordinary speech and doctrine; maintenance, on the other hand, is about the daily use of food and rest, which is easily understood and practiced by people. Thus, is there no cultivation? It is said: According to ancient texts, Shennong established the methods of medicine, and the Yellow Emperor initiated the techniques of guidance, which were passed down through generations, losing their true essence. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Eating and drinking in moderation, maintaining regular habits, avoiding excessive labor, and keeping one&#39;s spirit internal—how can illness arise from this? Therefore, one can live out their natural lifespan and depart at the age of a hundred. This is the true doctrine of maintenance. Having moderation and regularity without labor means that vital energy flows in accordance with its natural course, without the need for the burdensome efforts seen in contemporary practices. As for the internal manipulation of the Ren and Du meridians, prolonged practice can lead to carbuncles; prolonged manipulation of the Spleen can cause abdominal distension; prolonged manipulation of the Dan Tian can lead to hematuria; and prolonged manipulation of the cervical region can result in cerebral leakage.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>Internal movement is indeed inappropriate; as for the six-character mantra, though it can disperse external pathogens, those who are internally deficient and have sweat should avoid it; the eight-piece brocade, while capable of moving qi and blood, should be avoided by those who are internally deficient and have fire. Only a few practices of ancient guided movement recorded in the &quot;Essentials of Medical Forest&quot; are clearly feasible, and these are summarized below. Ultimately, they are simply the dances of scholars.</p>
<p>When the spirit is inwardly preserved, the body and mind become stable, and there is no reliance on strong subjugation, resembling the quiet cultivation of today. The discussions on cinnabar, lead, mercury, and the dragon and tiger in the &quot;Book of Alchemy&quot; are all metaphors for body and mind. The principle that the mind and breath depend on each other is the most direct and obvious: the heart governs the breath, and the breath depends on the heart. When the heart and breath coexist harmoniously, essence, qi, and spirit are abundant, which leads to the avoidance of illness.</p>
<p>Should one live to a hundred years, death is inevitable, as it has been since ancient times; one merely should not hasten their own demise. Is there really such a notion today of transcending and ascending beyond the world? Some might ask: if nourishment and care are so easy and evident, why are there more who die young than those who live long? The answer is that in matters of diet, daily living, and actions, how can one consistently follow the heart&#39;s guidance without making mistakes? When fragrant wine and delicious food are presented, although they may be harmful to the sick, one often cannot resist them. Moreover, when desires stir within, even if one is ill, it is hard to suppress the danger. The intense heart for name and profit and overexertion goes unnoticed. This is the great difference between longevity in ancient and modern times, not due to differences in constitution, but due to the modern neglect of self-care compared to the ancients.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>He said: I know that by keeping the spirit inwardly guarded, one can manage diet and daily life appropriately. In that case, the movements both inside and outside are not worth seeking. By practicing quietude, one can gather the spirit, which is indeed the correct way. He replied: If one does not recognize the limits of a hundred years and does not let go of worldly attachments, then even if one&#39;s eyes are closed all day, it is merely a bundle of personal desires, and the mind is still in motion. However, if one understands the limitations and proper constraints of a hundred years, then everything will naturally follow reason, without greed, impatience, or falsehood, which allows one to avoid illness and live out a full life. If one focuses on energy, thoughts of life and death become mixed up and unclear, leading to a greater desire for stillness that eludes them. If one focuses on reason, human desires dissipate, and the mind becomes clear and joyful, achieving stillness without seeking it. What is commonly referred to as stillness today is likely different from the ancient understanding of stillness. He said: If this is so, then our Confucian scholars are fully devoted to this. He replied: The teachings of the sages are vast and cannot be comprehended by just anyone.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor is also an ancient sage. Now, if one does not believe in the sayings of ancient sages but instead trusts blind and strange theories, it could lead to the ruin of families and loss of life; how misguided! This is why I only speak of preservation of health. </p>
<p>Is it possible to preserve health without medicine? By avoiding wind and cold to protect the skin and internal organs, there is no need for herbs like Ephedra or Cinnamon; by balancing labor and rest to protect the muscles and bones, there is no need for tonics to replenish energy and strengthen vitality. </p>
<p>By regulating sexual desires to nurture essence, and adjusting thoughts to cultivate spirit, why would one need decoctions that nourish Yin and reduce fire, or those that promote essence and concentrate the spirit? By eating lightly to nourish blood, and speaking less to conserve vital energy, why would one need the Four Substances, Four Monarchs, Ten Completes, or Three Harmony decoctions? </p>
<p>In essence, blood is generated by qi, and qi is sustained by spirit. Is it in spirit or heart? To nurture the heart, nothing is better than having few desires; I have heard this saying. I privately harbor intentions but have not dared to express them, to advise those who are weak and unaware of the importance of learning, that together we should adhere to restrictions, valuing this body as the foundation of all things.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Moderating Desires</strong></p>
<p>Those who honor life do not need to consume food or practice guiding exercises; they can clearly understand the nature of life and death, becoming almost like the Dao. The gateway to life and death shows that if one does not come into life, there is no death. Those with profound insight realize the state of non-birth. </p>
<p>Secondly, nothing is better than moderating desires. This may not necessarily lead to immortality, but it can help avoid illness. Conversely, if one pursues excessive desires, death results from life, and illness arises from desires. The skilled practitioner addresses illness before it occurs; the lesser skilled treats what is already present. When illness does arise, trace back to its source, which is due to negligence. Therefore, one should promptly sever excessive desires and habits, so that there is hope for recovery.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>The world seeks longevity through consumption, which is a delusion! Even more so, some take supplements daily to satisfy their desires, which is an even greater folly! </p>
<p>The Shaking (Zhen) and the Receptive (Kun) represent the dynamic of external engagement with the internal. This manifests in the nature of emotional desires; thus, the sages take the meanings associated with Zhen very seriously in the I Ching. When thunder rumbles, the noble person reflects with fear and self-examination. As for Returning, it is said that the ancient kings closed the gates at the solstice, wanting to restore tranquility. In Following, it is stated that when twilight arrives, one should rest peacefully, desiring stability. In Nourishing, it counsels caution in words and moderation in food, aspiring for rightful sustenance. Understanding this principle, the inner fire will naturally subside without medicinal intervention.</p>
<p>At winter solstice, one yang is born, and at summer solstice, one yin is born; these two solstices are of utmost importance. The solstice represents the extreme; yin is situated in the birth of yang. This is a transformation from non-existence to existence; yin emerges from the extreme of yang, showing the different transformations of yin and yang. In contrast, the spring and autumn equinoxes merely represent a balanced division thereof. However, the most significant is the winter solstice; hence, the I Ching states that the ancient kings closed the gates at the solstice. The term &quot;closed gates&quot; must be understood broadly. The &quot;Monthly Orders&quot; states that in this month, one should observe fasting and seclusion in anticipation of the fixed interplay of yin and yang, which transcends merely closing the gates of the market.</p>
<p>Medical Principles and Laws<br>[Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang]<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Harmony of Nourishing and Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The sage clarifies yin and yang, harmonizing the meridians and channels, solidifying the bones and marrow; when the qi and blood flow smoothly, both internally and externally are in harmony, and malevolent influences cannot cause harm. The senses are keen, and vital energy remains as it should. Thus, it can be seen that harmonizing the nourishing and defensive qi is of utmost importance for the human body. If one deeply contemplates the mechanism, one will realize that the protective qi is particularly essential.</p>
<p>The texts state: when yang qi disperses, yin qi will also perish; the defensive qi serves as a golden fortress protecting the nourishing qi. It emphasizes that observing the defensive qi is the mother of all diseases, and defensive qi serves as the throat and tongue through which diseases and evils enter and exit. The Book of Changes states: the way is called one yin and one yang; thus, it supports yang and restrains yin, pervading everything, and the path of immortality is similar. </p>
<p>Ah! The energy of the nose connects to the heavens, and the energy of the mouth connects to the earth. People usually know to nourish the body with the energy from the mouth, but only the wise understand to nourish the defensive qi with the energy from the nose. Nourishing the nourishing qi often leads to excesses that harm life, while nourishing the defensive qi enables one to align with the celestial forces and connect with the divine, each differing by the lunar and seasonal cycles. There’s no need for further inquiry!</p>
<p>Question: What is the method for regularly harmonizing the defensive qi? </p>
<p>Answer: Every evening as the sun sets, the door of yang qi within the body closes; one must pay careful attention to protect it and not allow it to reopen. The texts advise to gather and defend as night falls, avoiding disturbance to the muscles and bones, and not exposing oneself to mist or dew, thus fully understanding the principles of harmonizing the defensive qi. Gathering refers to storing the spirit and energy within, while defending refers to warding off malevolent qi from the outside. Just like the door that closes at dusk and opens at dawn, what fear could there be from disruptive guests? Even during times of emptiness and the phases of the moon, as long as the energy within remains solid, how could external disturbances penetrate?<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Cautiously Moderating the Five Tastes</strong></p>
<p>Question: If a flavor is overly sour, it draws the liver qi with its fluid, thereby exhausting the spleen qi. What does this mean? Answer: This pertains to the condition of a person&#39;s body. Wang&#39;s interpretation is forced and does not align with the principle. The innate essence of a person is entirely in the stomach. The abundance or scarcity of bodily fluids directly relates to the vigor of true qi. The stomach relies on the spleen to circulate its fluids; thus, the internal organs complement each other, preventing the stomach from becoming excessively moist and the spleen from becoming overly dry. Observing the following text about the flavor being overly bitter, we can ascertain that the spleen qi is not moistening, and the stomach qi is thick; thus, the spleen is too dry and the stomach too moist. Ultimately, they are interconnected organs that influence one another. Therefore, while the spleen qi is described as lacking moisture, the illness manifests in the stomach and is not severe yet. The excess sourness aids in bending and straightening, gradually drawing the stomach&#39;s fluids toward the liver, which in turn makes the liver qi feel enriched and abundant.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Excessive wood in the liver will inevitably constrain the earth, causing the spleen to be troubled, but it will not be completely exhausted. If the fluids in the stomach are still abundant, even if the spleen&#39;s essence is not nourished, there are still those that can be nourished; how can one then sit and await death?</p>
<p>Question: If the taste is excessively bitter, the stomach&#39;s energy will be thick; if the taste is excessively spicy, the spirit will be central. The note refers to thickness as strong and central as enduring. Can it be that among the five flavors, sour, salty, and sweet cause more damage, while bitter and spicy provide more benefit? </p>
<p>Response: The two meanings were originally not meant for this interpretation; Wang&#39;s note is entirely contrary to the text. Observing the stomach&#39;s energy as thick, and the spleen&#39;s energy as not being nourished, it is clear that the spleen&#39;s trouble does not allow for the stomach to transport fluids, leading to a buildup of energy in the stomach which becomes thick. Once the stomach&#39;s energy becomes thick, its capacity decreases, and in trying to compensate, it only leads to further deficiencies, making treatment even more difficult.</p>
<p>Today, people adhere to the teachings of a single school, the Eastern Garden, and when they encounter patients with stomach ailments, they uniformly apply fortifying methods. However, those who apply tonics and find themselves experiencing more bloating are precisely experiencing this issue.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>People from the northwest enjoy eating raw and tough wheat cheese, but when they fall ill, they resort to consuming cowherb and croton seeds before they begin to feel better. Spices, sand, oranges, and half of those remedies may not be effective; what then of using ginseng and herbs for nourishment? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when the stomach qi is full, it leads to distension, and when it is deficient, it causes diarrhea; this is evident. Regarding the spirit, which is central, it has been mentioned above that when tendons and meridians are slack, it indicates that the tendons and meridians relax and do not contract properly. Furthermore, a person’s spirit must be carefully preserved and should not be consumed in excess; can prolonged dispersion of energy not lead to harm? If it is said to be central, then the ailment may have sudden and violent potential. It is commonly believed that consuming too much spice leads to early death; is that not true? </p>
<p>In response to the question: Excessive salty flavor exhausts the bones and vital energy, and has not been resolved before; please clarify! It is said that within the body, there are indications that the heart is not functioning properly and the kidneys are not performing their duties correctly, as the kidneys are considered the governing organs of strength.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>It is said that the kidney is never without imbalance, and the heart is never without corruption, as the heart is the dwelling place of desires. When the vital essence is overexerted, both the heart and kidneys are affected, yet it is not entirely true. I have seen great monks and enlightened beings, who cultivate truth and meditate, suddenly experience disturbances in their energy and essence, realizing that the taste of excessive salt is detrimental. The notion of overexerting one&#39;s vital essence does not solely pertain to desires. Indeed, excessive salt in the diet severely supplements the kidneys, leading to a sudden accumulation of energy that encourages overexertion. Once the energy stirs within, the essence yearns to be released; even if there is nothing visibly desirable, one cannot suppress this urge. The texts state that vigorous encounters harm the kidney qi and damage the bones; this stems from the uncontrolled pursuit of desires. How is it that those who pursue purity and refinement often consume too much salty and rich food among their vegetables, thereby harming their body and failing to align with the principles outlined in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;? Once illness has taken hold and they adhere to a bland diet for years, it may provide some relief, yet it is far from as effective as moderating salt consumption in the first place. Thus, this matter concerns both aspects.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>Food enters the stomach, and the essence and qi first flow to the spleen and return to the lungs, rising to follow the commands of spring and summer, nourishing the entire body; this is the pure qi representing heaven. It then ascends to the bladder, following the commands of autumn and winter, processing the waste and transforming flavors outward; this is the turbid yin representing earth. If one aligns with the energies of the four seasons, adapts their daily life accordingly to avoid the cold and heat, regulates diet, and does not indulge in excessive joy or anger to maintain mental clarity, desiring a balanced state throughout the seasons without preference for any, then one remains at peace. Otherwise, damage to the spleen and stomach can occur, with true qi sinking down or leaking out and failing to rise, which signifies there being autumn and winter without spring and summer. This leads to the potential for growth being hindered, caught in the destructive energies of decay, resulting in the emergence of various ailments, and even prolonged ascent without descent can also be a disease.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spirit Chapter&quot; states: If the heart is anxious and over-thinks, it harms the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, fear ensues and one loses themselves. The &quot;Evil Qi Afflicting Organs&quot; chapter states: Worry and fear harm the heart. The &quot;Inquiry Chapter&quot; states: Sorrow and grief move the heart; when the heart moves, all five organs and six bowels also tremble. It is evident that the heart is the commander of the five organs and six bowels, overseeing the soul and spirit, encompassing desires and intentions. Thus, worry affects the lung, thought affects the spleen, anger affects the liver, and fear affects the kidneys; this is why the five emotions are governed by the heart. If one can nurture this heart well, and dwell in tranquility, without unnecessary fear or exuberance, harmoniously adapting to circumstances without contention, and changing with the times without a sense of self, then one&#39;s intentions are in harmony, the spirit is stable, anger does not arise, the soul does not scatter, and the five organs maintain tranquility; thus, evil cannot affect one.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>On the Care of the Body</strong></p>
<p>Laozi said: The reason I have great troubles is because I have a body. If I had no body, what troubles would I have? I would say: The reason I have great joys is because I have form; if I had no form, what joy would I have? It can be seen that what one possesses is merely the self, and what I rely on is merely the body. Without form, there would be no self; is this not the foremost duty of living? However, the significance of form is very subtle. As for movements, sights, and sounds, are they not all manifestations of this form? Beauty and ugliness, are they not reflections of this form? Courage and cowardice, wisdom and foolishness, are they not aspects of this form? Life and death, peace and distress, are they not related to this form? Human interactions are based on form; accomplishments are built upon form. The meaning of this form can be understood accordingly. </p>
<p>Yet, people are unaware of how to nourish their bodies. If they do not injure their bodily forms through emotions and desires, they instead damage their bodily forms through labor and toil. When the inner form is harmed, the spirit and energy are depleted; when the outer form is hurt, the limbs become impaired. Even to the point where muscles wither away, the form becomes evident; once the form is defeated, the life can be understood. Thus, those who are good at preserving life must first nourish the body as the dwelling of the spirit. Those who are good at treating illnesses must first address the body as the foundation for recovery. Although there are many methods for caring for the body, ultimately, understanding the essence of vital energy and blood is sufficient to encompass it all.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>To dispel external邪, it cannot be achieved without 精血; to strengthen inner气, it cannot be accomplished without 精血. There is true气 in water, and true液 in fire; without 精血, how can one make them rise and fall? The spleen is the foundation of the five organs, and the kidney is the source of their transformation; without 精血, how can one irrigate them? Thus, 精血 is indeed form, and form is indeed 精血. Heaven gives birth to water, which is the ancestor of form. Therefore, anyone wishing to treat illness must prioritize the body; anyone wishing to treat the body must first focus on 精血. This is indeed the great path for doctors. If one can understand this, then transformation can be boundless and divine use can be unfathomable. However, utilizing this method does not exceed medicinal foods, and among these, the most relevant is only a few flavors. Other variations based on individual tendencies are but supplementary aids. Just as in food, who among edible things is without benefit? If one seeks purity and goodness, most suitable for the stomach&#39;s气, only grains can be seen. If one asks me what is appropriate, I find it hard to articulate. Those who appreciate my words will naturally find them sweet; those who do not will likely twist them for their own purposes, undermining the essence. Thus, I cannot speak explicitly. I shall clarify this meaning, awaiting those with insight to comprehend it themselves.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Nourishing and Replenishing Door</p>

<p>Peng Zu&#39;s Vitality-Bolstering Pill for Longevity: This formula contains twenty ingredients used by Bian Que. It regulates rising and sinking, governs the sovereign and officials, and treats diseases like fatigue and cough, with all cases achieving recovery. Not only for fatigue, but also when used once in each of the four seasons, it strengthens the vital energy, preventing a hundred diseases. For chronic cough, shortness of breath, spitting blood due to cold and fatigue, seminal emissions, impotence, extreme weakness of the lower essence, mental instability, phlegm obstruction, and for women with prolonged menstrual disorders or infertility, or a cold uterus, using this moxibustion will eliminate all ailments and enhance vitality, thereby prolonging life.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>Ginseng, Aconite, Pepper (each 7 qian); Night Bright Sand, Five Spirits Fat, Myrrh, Tiger Bone, Snake Bone, Dragon Bone, White Aconite, Vermilion, Musk (each 5 qian); Blue Salt, Fennel (each 4 qian); Cloves, Realgar, Frankincense, Wood Fragrant (each 3 qian). </p>
<p>Grind these into a powder. Then, take white flour to make a ring and place it around the navel. Divide the previous medicine into three portions. Take one portion, first fill five qian of musk powder into the navel, then place the remaining two portions of medicine into the flour ring, pressing it down tightly. Puncture several holes, then use a piece of Sophora bark to cover the medicine, and use moxa to cauterize. It should not be hastily done; enhance the heating effect. The moxa should be applied from top to bottom or bottom to top, until the body becomes thoroughly warm, making the patient feel drowsy like being intoxicated. </p>
<p>Cauterize until reaching fifty or sixty strong applications, making the body sweat profusely, from the brain down to the Yongquan point. By doing so, the wind, cold, heat, and dampness in the bone marrow, along with the five labors and seven injuries, will all be removed. If no sweat occurs, the illness has not yet been cured. Cauterize again after three to five days until sweating reaches the desired amount. Practitioners must be cautious. If cauterization reaches one hundred and twenty strong applications, the illness will surely be healed. </p>
<p>During cauterization, be careful of wind and cold, and avoid raw, cold, or greasy foods. After a month of care, one&#39;s spirit and health will improve further. For women, while cauterizing at the navel, replace the musk with one qian of aromatic brain.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br><strong>Secret Recipe for Strengthening the Body</strong></p>
<p>The essence of life forms through the woman&#39;s vital blood, connecting with the maternal energy via the umbilical cord, which follows the mother&#39;s breath. After ten months, the baby is born and gradually grows into adulthood, but the seven emotions and six desires invade both internally and externally, leading to the loss of true essence and eventually death—this is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>I mourn for the people of this world and am sharing this excellent recipe to strengthen the foundation and protect the body. It enhances the original essence and eliminates various diseases, proving effective like magic. It should be performed once every year on the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Frankincense </li>
<li>Myrrh </li>
<li>Rat feces </li>
<li>Green salt </li>
<li>Dipsacus root (each 2 qian) </li>
<li>Musk (1 fen)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind these into a powder and have the person lie on their back after a satisfying meal. Mix the powder with buckwheat water to knead into a ring about an inch in diameter and 2 inches if the navel is larger, placing the medicine in the navel. Cover it with a slice of locust tree bark and then circle it again with the medicine, using a small amount of mugwort to apply gentle moxibustion.</p>
<p>Let the channels flow freely, causing cold sweat to pour off. Be cautious not to induce pain, as it can lead to a loss of true energy. Moxibustion should continue until the person&#39;s age is reached. For the healthy, moxibustion can be done for several consecutive days; for the sick, once every three days. Stop when sounds and pain arise in the abdomen, or when foamy stools are passed. </p>
<p>Only consume rice soup, along with some white meat and yellow wine, to enhance the medicine&#39;s potency. If suffering from wind or heat trapped in the skin&#39;s pores, add red lead powder to the medicine to promote easy sweating and facilitate recovery.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br><strong>Jie Ming Dan</strong>: Nourishes the lower abdomen, supports the kidneys, replenishes essence and marrow, reverses aging and prolongs life. </p>

<p>Treats headaches and dizziness. It is said: When the earth is thick and the water is deep, residing there brings no illness. Therefore, people seek places where the earth is thick and the water is deep. The soil should be firm, moist, and yellow; the water should be sweet, pleasant, and clear. The living space should be well-rounded and tightly sealed, with no fine gaps, to prevent wind and air from entering. Wind is the essence of heaven and earth; it can generate all things and also harm people. Initially entering through the pores, it gradually reaches the muscles, internal pathways, and ultimately affects the organs, causing significant changes. During the height of summer, one should not sleep exposed. From the beginning of spring until before the beginning of autumn, one should sleep with the head to the east; from the beginning of autumn until before the beginning of winter, the head should be to the west. Always use a medicinal pillow. If the medicinal properties of the pillow are excessively hot, the heat will rise; if excessively cold, the cold will harm the brain. Only a pillow that harmonizes wind and coolness is appropriate.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Mān jīng zǐ, sweet chrysanthemum flowers,通草,防风, antelope horn [shavings], rhinoceros horn, stone calamus [eight parts each], xì xīn, báizhǐ, xuāngǔn, dried stems [six qian each], baizhu [four fen], black beans [five he, selected and cleaned]. </p>
<p>The above-mentioned herbs are to be finely powdered, mixed evenly, and placed in a silk pouch. To retain its aroma, use a green ro cloth bag to hold it, shaped like a pillow, filling it with the medicine and packing it tightly. Place it in a box whose shape is also like a pillow, allowing the medicine pouch to extend one and a half inches outside the box lip. When you wish to use it at night, remove the box lid; if not using it, replace the lid to prevent the medicinal aroma from dispersing. </p>
<p>Over time, as the pillow flattens, add more herbs to fill it, or supplement with black beans to restore its original shape. After three to five months, when the medicinal aroma dissipates, replace it, and do not use it for a time. If after ten days or a month a slight ringing is heard in the ears, it indicates the medicine is taking effect.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br><strong>Heaven-Sewing Great Pill</strong></p>

If the bamboo is large and fat, slightly increase the amount of powdered medicine; if it&#39;s dry, use a little honey. Daily, take one hundred pills on an empty stomach. For someone ill, take two doses a day. If there are bone issues, add earth bone skin and remove its wood, use motherwort without hairs, and wine-fry peony bark to remove its wood. If there is blood deficiency, add double the amount of angelica and rehmannia. If there is qi deficiency, add one tael each of ginseng and astragalus honey-roasted. If there is kidney deficiency, include one and a half taels of fried raspberry, fried fennel, wood-removed morinda, and seed-removed evodia—this requires pure meat flavor. For lower back pain, add one and a half taels of salt-water fried atractylodes, wine-washed rhizoma pubescentis, wine-washed and soft-roasted cynanchum, and wine-washed and soft-roasted fracture herb.

<p>Single Recipe</p>
<p>Method of consuming Poria: Poria is undoubtedly a divine medicine, but it contains red fibers; if these are not removed, prolonged consumption may not benefit the eyes and could make them smaller. One should slice it into small square pieces after peeling, and cook it in clean water in a silver or stone vessel until it becomes soft and disintegrated. Place it in a fine cloth bag and knead it in cold water until it resembles starch, then strain the powder and leave the fibers in the bag to discard. Use the powder mixed with honey in a moist, fragrant manner; steaming it before consumption is especially good. Pure black sesame, steamed and sun-dried nine times, should be crushed in water and filtered to obtain the white juice, which is then boiled in a silver or stone vessel until it resembles apricot jelly soup. Finally, add crushed jujube flesh after removing the skin and pit, and mix it with the Poria powder for eating, which is particularly remarkable.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>Method for Consuming Di Huang: Take fat, tender Di Huang (Rehmannia) about one or two inches long, cut it off, and wrap the ends with thin paper. Coat its surface with pig brain, place it in a small plate, and hang it in a ventilated area for over ten days to dry naturally. Shake it out to obtain a fine yellow powder, which has a unique texture resembling a goose&#39;s tube. When this powder is added to boiling soup, it is also referred to as gold powder soup.</p>
<p>When it rains, place this in a wide container in the courtyard, and the resulting substance is sweet and smooth beyond description. It is good for pouring into tea or cooking medicine, both being attractive and beneficial. Consuming it without pause can lead to longevity. Additionally, spring water, which is sweet and cool, serves as good medicine as well. Dry it and transform it according to the energy of the Earth’s hexagrams, thus the heavens represent water. </p>
<p>I’ve heard from Taoist practitioners that if one can consume well water essence, its effects are similar to those of stone sulfur and other minerals; however, even those who are not practitioners can develop boils on their backs and heads upon experiencing it, as I have observed. Furthermore, collect well water at the right time of day, store it carefully, and after seven days, it may generate substances resembling mica. Taoists say that gold in the water can be nourished and refined into elixirs, which I have indeed witnessed. This is quite simple, yet one alone cannot achieve it, much less what is termed the original essence.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br><strong>Method for Consuming Pine Resin:</strong> The best pine resin is the genuine kind from Zhendingshan. Place it in a fine cloth bag and boil it in clean water to make a soup. Skim off the floating impurities with a new strainer and place them in new water. Discard any that do not come out after prolonged boiling. Add powdered fresh white poria, without processing it; simply peel, pound, and mix it well. Every morning, take three qian (approximately 9 grams) using a spoon, place it in your mouth, swish with some warm water, and then follow the usual method for cleaning your teeth with the resin. Afterward, drink a little warm water and swish and spit again following the same method. This can strengthen teeth, improve complexion, and darken hair.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Refining Zai Er Ointment:</strong> Both the Zai Er (a type of plant) along with its roots, stems, leaves, and seeds should be rinsed to remove dirt. Hang them in the shade to dry and then crush them into ash. Extract the concentrated juice from the ash and refine it over two stoves. Wait for the ash juice to reduce, then quickly transfer to a side cauldron to add the refined ash juice. Maintain a fire continuously for one day and night to gradually obtain the ointment, which should be stored in a dry porcelain jar. Take a dosage of one qian mixed with wine every morning and evening before sleeping. It warms the body, dispels wind, and improves appearance—its effects cannot be fully expressed. Particularly effective for treating skin conditions, making the skin smooth and clean. When cleansing your face or bathing, use a small amount like a soap bean for best results, with no restrictions. Su Changtu’s father, who advised the Scholar of Yizhou and lived in Yong, took this for over ten years and reached eighty-seven years of age, appearing rosy and vigorous, likely due to the power of this medicine.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br><strong>Method of Consuming Fresh Ginger:</strong> In the past, while overseeing the county of Qiantang, I visited the Jingci Temple, where there was a monk named Congyue Wang, over eighty years old, with a complexion like flushed cinnabar and eyes shining brightly. When I inquired about his abilities, it seemed he could diagnose pulses and know fortunes, much like a wise person. He claimed to have consumed fresh ginger for forty years, which is why he did not age. Ginger can strengthen the spleen, warm the kidneys, invigorate the blood, and enhance energy. </p>
<p>The method involves selecting fresh ginger that has no fibrous residue; however, do not use young ginger. The ginger should be crushed along with its skin to extract its juice, which is then stored in a container. After some time, the top yellow liquid is discarded, and the clearer liquid below it is collected and dried in the shade until it resembles fine flour, known as ginger milk. This can be mixed with steamed cakes or formed into small balls the size of walnut, taken with alcohol or salt rice soup, swallowing dozens of pellets at a time. Alternatively, the powder can be added to various foods or beverages. </p>
<p>Congyue Wang remarked: &quot;As a monk, I am poor and can&#39;t afford to prepare this properly; I simply chew the skin and swallow it with warm water.&quot; At first, it is indeed spicy, but after a while, it becomes pleasant. Now, I find it only sweet and delightful.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br><strong>Method of Using Muscovite:</strong><br>Take twenty catties of white muscovite and thinly split it. Use eight dou of dewdrops to make a soup, divide it in half, and wash it twice. Then make an additional soup with two dou, adding ten catties of natron, and soak it in wooden containers for twenty days. Afterward, take it out, place it in a silk bag, and hang it in a room without exposure to wind or sunlight to dry. Use deer skin to make the bag and knead it. From dawn until noon, sift out the residue and knead it again to obtain five dou of fine powder, discarding the rest. Take one dou of this powder and mix it with two catties of cliff honey, stirring it into a paste. Place it in a bamboo tube, slice it thinly, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it under the southern slope of the northern wall, six feet deep. Cover it with soil. In spring and summer, leave it for forty days; in autumn and winter, thirty days. When you take it out, it should turn into water. If it has not dissolved properly, bury it for another thirty days. This water can cure myriad ailments and relieve fatigue, wind, and pain. It should be taken with one cup of warm water, three times a day. After ten days, the urine should turn yellow; after twenty days, the internal cold and dampness will dissipate; after thirty days, decayed teeth will regenerate; after forty days, one will no longer fear wind or cold; and after fifty days, all ailments will be cured, with the complexion improving daily, leading to long life and becoming a celestial being.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>Lei Xia said: As for using muscovite that is yellow-black, thick, and stubborn red in color, which has been handled by women, it is not effective. The best is that which is shiny and clear like ice. For every pound, use one ounce of small earth gall, purple-backed daylily, sweet licorice, and prepared rhubarb juice, finely ground if dry, and extracted for juice if wet. Place these in a porcelain crucible, add three ounces of water from the Tianchi lake, and apply heat to simmer for seven days and nights, carefully controlling the water and fire. The muscovite will naturally form a jade-like paste at the bottom of the crucible. Then, vigorously pour in Tianchi water and stir. Remove any floating froth as it appears. This process should be done three times to purify it. Take one tael of agarwood and grind it into powder; use two liters of water from Tianchi to simmer the agarwood, dividing the water into three portions, and then re-purify the muscovite paste. Let it dry in the sun for practical use. The Baopuzi states: When taking the method of five clouds, one may use桂葱水玉 (cassia and garlic water jade) to transform it into water; or use dew in ceramic containers and boil it with original water; or combine quicklime in a tube and bury it to make water; or gather honey to make curd; or soak in autumn dew for a hundred days. Grind the materials with powdered herb or combine with the blood of the Ailanthus tree for use.

Shizhen stated: Daoist texts say that boiling mica in salt water can yield powder. It is also said that for one pound of mica, soak it in one dou of salt in a copper vessel, steam for one day, and then crush it in a mortar to make powder. Additionally, it is noted that for one pound of mica and one liter of white salt, pound them finely into a heavy cloth bag, press it to extract all the salt flavor, and then hang it in a high place to air dry, which will naturally turn it into powder.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br><strong>Method of Consuming White Quartz:</strong></p>

Finally, store it in a cotton bag and hang it above the door.</p>
<p>Every day before combing your hair, take seven grains with water or wine and press down your lower abdomen with two spoonfuls of rice. You will not be affected by anything foul or evil, nor by white liquor or beef, which are usually to be avoided. Over time, new stones will push out the old ones.

<p>The dual alchemy of yin and yang: Those who refine autumn stones usually only apply the method of fire refinement. However, this medicine must combine both yin and yang refinement to be the ultimate medicine.

<p>The &quot;Medical Entry&quot; states: The navel of a person, at the beginning of life, receives the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood, which coalesce. In the womb, during the formless chaos when the supreme ultimate has not yet separated, the vital energy divides into two apertures, appearing like the four points of emergence, externally linking to the two kidneys, internally nurturing the red and white meridians. Among the four points, there is a division of exterior and interior. In the mother&#39;s belly, the mother breathes and the child breathes; the mother inhales and the child inhales. It is like a navel connecting as flowers and fruits on branches. After one month and one week, the genuine energy gradually becomes sufficient. Upon birth, the placenta has not yet detached, and the umbilical cord is loosely severed. If the navel remains open, exposure to wind or cold may harm the infant&#39;s true energy. Thus, by fumigating with moxa several times, the true energy will be safeguarded. At three to seven days, the navel closes. Only then does it feel deep in the mouth. Therefore, as yang becomes exuberant and ages, it indulges in the five tastes, is drained by the five sounds, and is affected by the five qi, externally exhausting vital energy and internally suffering from cold, preventing the smooth flow of true energy. Thus, laws are established to steam the navel and secure the connection, like watering the soil so that grass and trees thrive.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>When one frequently uses this method of fumigation, then harmony and balance are achieved, the soul is settled, and the body is protected from cold and heat, leading to good health, which has a certain marvelous effect. The lungs are like the canopy of the five organs, from which the voice arises. The skin and fur depend on it for nourishment, and kidney essence is generated from it. If the pores are not tightly closed, external pathogens can invade and cause internal injuries, resulting in coughing. External factors can disperse, while internal injuries can cause dampness. If there are blockages, they should be resolved. If one uses harsh or drying medicinals or fails to disperse, this can lead to stagnant energy in the lungs, producing excessive phlegm and causing wheezing and coughing. If there is damage from labor or diet leading to blood vomit, with sudden chills and fevers, feelings of fatigue, mental fog, a heavy chest, diminished appetite, and weak spirit, then these ailments arise. Physicians may urgently use medicinal pills like Baozhen Wan or Huatan Wan to treat these conditions. If they are ineffective, one must fumigate the navel according to the method. Hereafter, I will provide this prescription, named the Pengzu Pill for Enhancing Yang, Firming Foundations, and Promoting Longevity.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>The method utilizes five parts of musk, bringing various herbs into the five zang organs and six fu organs, circulating through all joints; three qians of clove are used to nourish the lungs and strengthen the spleen and stomach; four qians of blue salt enter the kidneys to solidify the essence, preventing leakage from the lung mother, much like a wet nurse nurturing a child, enhancing vitality and blood; five qians of night-bright sand penetrate the lung openings, replenishing insufficient qi and dispersing excess from internal injuries; three qians each of frankincense and agarwood, and four qians of fennel seed are prescribed to treat dampness and fluid retention, regulating flow and ascending or descending qi to prevent wheezing and coughing, as if seeking to stem a water source, one must first locate its origin; five qians each of myrrh, tiger bone, snake bone, dragon bone, and vermilion, alongside three qians of realgar, aim to remove the root of the illness, supporting the weak and eliminating the strong; five qians of white attached herb follow the meridians, having the ability to push forward and pull back; seven qians each of ginseng, prepared aconite, and black pepper nourish the original qi, promote blood flow, and transform phlegm into fluids; five qians of five-spirit resin protect lung qi, addressing excess and deficiency; the skin of the locust tree can contain the properties of all herbs, preventing them from wandering; mugwort leaves harness fire to dispel illness and toxins, facilitating revival from death. This is the powder mixture. Additionally, use white flour to make a ring around the navel, taking the prepared herbs divided into three parts, and place one part inside, adding five parts of musk powder into the navel.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>Furthermore, divide the previous medicine and place it inside the inner circle, pressing the medicine firmly. Insert several holes in between, cover it with a piece of sophora bark, and perform moxibustion with mugwort fire. This should not harm or easily damage, but strengthen the heat. Whether treating from top to bottom or bottom to top, the heat spreads throughout the body, making the patient feel fatigued as if intoxicated. When moxibustion is applied vigorously fifty to sixty times, profuse sweating occurs, from the Baihui point at the top to the Yongquan point at the bottom. In this way, all cold, heat, humidity, and the seven injuries and five strains are completely removed. If sweating does not occur, the illness has not yet been cured; repeat the moxibustion after three to five days until sweating reaches an appropriate level, and practitioners must be careful. When moxibustion reaches one hundred twenty times, the illness will surely heal. During the moxibustion, be cautious of wind and cold, avoiding greasy and cold foods. After one month of care, the energy will be even more vigorous. </p>
<p>If a woman undergoes moxibustion on the navel, remove the musk and add one qian of safflower. Bian Que made clear with these twenty ingredients, rising and falling in balance, the roles of monarch, minister, assistant, and messenger; any labor cough ailments can be cured. Not only labor ailments, but if performed once in every season, the vital energy will become strong, and a hundred diseases will not arise. For persistent cough, breathlessness, coughing up blood, cold fatigue, seminal emission, weakness of yang, mental imbalance, phlegm obstruction, and for women experiencing prolonged white or red discharge, unable to conceive, with a very cold uterus; using this moxibustion, a hundred ailments will be swiftly removed, enhancing energy and prolonging life. </p>

The spirit of a person strongly desires tranquility, while the qi desires extreme motion. However, in later generations, immortal practitioners have also deceived people with these as methods for becoming immortal.<br>Therefore, Wang Bao praised: &quot;There is no need to bend and stretch like Peng Zu, boast about breathing like the tall pines, detached and far removed from the mundane world!&quot; In truth, it is simply a dance for nurturing the blood vessels. Although the method may seem rough, it benefits those who stay in seclusion to guard against illness. After all, sitting upright all day long is what most leads to illness.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>People only know the harm of prolonged standing and walking, but do not realize that long periods of lying down or sitting are even more harmful. Therefore, I will record one or two essential points for those who seek health to consider.</p>
<p>The primary method: The practice of guiding and stretching is designed to address deficiencies in qi and blood. If there is heat, keep the eyes open; if there is no heat, keep the eyes closed. If there is no sweat, hold the breath to the limit; if there is sweat, it is not necessary to hold the breath. To let qi rise and treat ailments of the ears, eyes, mouth, and teeth, bend the body; to let qi descend and facilitate urination and defecation, as well as strengthen the legs, lie down; to allow qi to reach the limbs, lie on one side. To relieve headaches, tilt the head back; to address ailments in the waist and feet, straighten the toes upward; to alleviate chest pain, pull the toes; for arm issues, cover the arm. To dispel cold and heat accumulation in the abdomen and alleviate coldness coupled with body heat, one can hold the breath, fill the abdomen, and lie down; this can also be done. However, for issues in the head and chest, raise the pillow seven inches; for problems below the heart, raise it four inches; for ailments below the navel, do not use a pillow.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br>Switching Method: First, with the left thigh aligned with the shoulder, make nine circular rotations forward; then, with the right thigh aligned with the shoulder, make nine rotations forward. Repeat this with both thighs and shoulders, making nine rotations forward. It is also good to increase up to thirty-nine rotations in total. However, the practice should be done slowly and gently. It can also be done with a gradual start followed by increased intensity. This method clears blockages in the body, benefits the heart’s pericardium, and is similar in intention to Zhang Ziqiu&#39;s treatment for tuberculosis using the switching formula, effectively treating minor strain, back pain, and chest tightness.</p>
<p>Raising Thigh Method: First, sit quietly to cultivate inner energy. Then, with both hands crossed, make strong movements to push left and right seven times each. When pushing left, turn the head to the right; when pushing right, turn the head to the left. Repeat this three to five times, then sit quietly for a long while. This method harmonizes the spleen and stomach and aids in improving appetite, as well as treating stiffness in the arms and lower back. It can also be practiced in conjunction with the Switching Method.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br>The method of relieving stagnation: it involves swirling the hands in circles, moving them forward and backward, with the feet imitating the walking steps of a heron, without concern for the number of repetitions. After a long time, place the left hand on the right shoulder and the right foot on the left knee, then walk in a relaxed manner; switch to placing the right hand on the left shoulder and the left foot on the right knee, and walk in a relaxed manner. After a long time, extend the left hand forward to rest on the abdomen, while placing the right foot on the left knee and walking; extend the right hand backward to rest on the waist, while placing the left foot on the right knee and walking. After a long time, raise both hands vigorously to the sky and stomp the feet firmly on the ground, then move the hands downward and backward while curling the toes and leaning back to allow the breath to descend. After a long time, squat down and grip the heels tightly with both hands, while the toes push down, and lower the head as far as possible to the knees. After a long time, stand up and cross the hands over the arms on the chest, shaking vigorously several times. This method is effective for those troubled by unmet desires and stagnation, feelings of fullness in the heart and abdomen, and restless nights. Those without illness may also practice it. If one is affected by wind and cold from outside, one should continue until sweat breaks out as a measure.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br>This method, compared to Hua&#39;s Five Animal Play, is simpler and more practical. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical System&quot; states: The key to preserving life lies in sustaining one&#39;s thoughts. &quot;Sustaining&quot; refers to preserving our spirit, while &quot;thinking&quot; refers to pondering our heart. By closing our eyes to see our own eyes and focusing our heart to see our own heart, we do not separate from our body and do not harm our spirit; thus, this is the gradual practice of sustaining thought. </p>
<p>In the vast emptiness of heaven and earth, there is qi; within the human body, there is also qi. Therefore, expelling impure qi is the qi within the body; inhaling pure qi is the qi of heaven and earth. A person is in qi as a fish swims in water; if the belly of the fish cannot take in or expel water, it dies. Similarly, if the human abdomen cannot take in or expel qi, one also dies; the principle is the same. Those who are adept at preserving life must understand the nature of qi.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>If one wishes to master the art of regulating breath, one should often eat early, close the door, set the bed warm, raise the pillow about two inches, lie flat with the body straight, close the eyes and grip firmly, keeping the feet five inches apart, and the arms also five inches from the body. First, one must hold the breath and inhale through the nose, gradually filling the abdomen, then hold it. When it becomes unbearable, one should exhale slowly through the mouth, not letting all the breath escape at once. After the breath stabilizes, one should close it again, starting with ten breaths, or twenty breaths, until it becomes unbearable. Gradually, with practice, one can increase this, but if one can hold it for over eighty breaths, then a pure flow of clear energy fills the organs and chest. When one has perfected this practice, at the time of holding the breath, there will be only a short breath remaining in the nose, with the held breath circulating like steam nourishing the lungs, making the body feel as if it is filled with a divine spirit. The experience is indescribably delightful. This is because the breath circulates freely within and without, reaching thoroughly up and down. As the held breath gradually dissipates, one returns to a state of normalcy. This method relies on consistency; if one can practice this twice daily, over time, one&#39;s senses will become sharp, the spirit will be complete, the body healthy and light, and all ailments will be eradicated.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>When beginning to regulate the breath, it is essential to maintain tranquility and harmony, without contention with intent. If harmony is not attained, one should pause and wait for it, practicing until one does so without fatigue, which is good. Holding the breath should resemble the descending dragon or the crouching tiger; one must understand its spiritual nature. The chest and diaphragm should remain empty, not full. If the breath becomes stagnant and fails to flow, one should use exhalation methods to eliminate it, such as blowing, puffing, gasping, or sighing. Otherwise, the source will be blocked, leading to backflow, and the troubles of sores and conditions will emerge.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: &quot;Exhaling and inhaling, discarding the old and taking in the new, is merely an extension of life.&quot; This is what practitioners of guidance and those who nurture life, like Peng Zu who lived long, appreciate. Therefore, it is known that the art of guidance has been passed down since ancient times. Thus, it is said that Peng Zu’s preferences originate from discussions among self-cultivators and medical practitioners, encompassing several hundred teachings. Here, I present the essential and appropriate sixteen principles, supported by various texts, which collectively represent the core teachings.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>The method of guiding and cultivating energy is often practiced at midnight and just before dawn, as the air is clear and the stomach is empty, which is beneficial for the practitioner. First, close your eyes and hold them firmly, sit quietly with a focused mind, and knock your teeth thirty-six times. Then, use both hands to embrace your neck, turning left and right for twenty-four times; this helps to eliminate the wind and pathogens accumulated in the chest and sides. Next, cross both hands, support empty space as if holding up the heavens, and press your hands against your neck twenty-four times; this helps to dispel the evil energy in the chest and diaphragm. Again, grab both hands, press on the left knee and twist the body to the left, press on the right knee and twist to the right, for twenty-four times; this can remove wind evil from the liver. Then, stretch your left hand forward and your right hand backward, as if drawing a bow, for twenty-four times; this can clear the accumulated evil from the kidneys. Finally, sit broad with both hands extended, turning your head left and right while glancing back at your shoulders for twenty-four times; this can help eliminate accumulated evil from the spleen.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br>First, clasp your hands tightly together and support them against your sides. Shake your shoulders twenty-four times; this can dispel the wind evil between your waist and ribs. Next, with both hands, strike your arms and shoulders, connecting with your waist and thighs, doing this twenty-four times; this can eliminate the evil from your limbs and chest. Then, sit deeply with your body leaned to one side, raising both hands upwards as if supporting the heavens for twenty-four times; this can remove the accumulated evils in your lungs. After that, while seated, stretch your legs out and lean forward with both hands to reach your feet twenty times. Bend the foot you reach, placing it on your knee, and massage it twenty-four times; this can clear the evil qi from your heart&#39;s vessels. Next, place both hands on the ground, contract your body and curve your back, raising upwards thirteen times; this can eliminate the accumulated evils from your heart and liver. Finally, stand by the bed, lean backwards while looking behind you, to the left and right twenty-four times; this can dispel the wind-heat evil in your kidneys.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br>Stand up again and walk slowly, with both hands firmly grasped. Step forward with the left foot, swinging the left hand forward and the right hand backward. Step forward with the right foot, swing the right hand forward, and the left hand backward twenty-four times. This can dispel the邪 (evil) from both shoulders. Then clasp your hands behind your back, bending forward and gently twisting twenty-four times. This can dispel the邪 between the two flanks. Next, interlock your feet and walk, stepping forward a number of steps and then backward the same. Again, sit up high and stretch your legs, interlocking both feet inward, twenty-four times. The above two sets can dispel wind邪 from both knees and between the feet. After completing these sixteen steps, sit upright, close your eyes, firm your grip, and concentrate. Place your tongue against the palate, churning saliva, swish it in your mouth thirty-six times, making a sloshing sound as you swallow. Then hold your breath and visualize the fire in your丹田 (dantian), rising from below to ignite the body, creating warmth inside and out until it ceases.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br>According to Laozi&#39;s twenty-four guiding techniques, Brahmins have twelve techniques, Chisongzi has eighteen methods, Zhongli has eighteen methods, and Hu Jiansu&#39;s method for the five organs consists of twelve techniques, all of which provide profound insights. However, the essence can be summarized in this way. Practitioners who practice one or two times daily will gradually become fit and light, banishing all evils; they will run and gallop without fatigue.</p>
<p>The &quot;Six Characters Breathing Formula&quot; from the Taishang Yuzhu: The Daoist canon contains the &quot;Yuzhu Sutra,&quot; which discusses the qi of the five organs and six bowels. Imbalances from the five flavors, combined with the six desires and seven feelings, can lead to illnesses over time, injuring the organs internally and attacking the nine orifices externally, resulting in diseases throughout the body. Mild cases may result in chronic ailments, severe cases in blindness or disability, and worst cases can lead to death. Therefore, Taishang shows compassion. This six-character breathing formula addresses the illnesses of the five organs and six bowels. The method involves exhaling to release toxic gases from the organs and inhaling to gather the pure qi of heaven and earth. There are small results in one day, significant results in ten days, and after a year, one will be free from all ailments.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>Extend life and enhance calculations, a treasure of health, not to be passed on to the unworthy.

The six forms serve to regulate the qi of the six organs: &quot;he&quot; regulates the heart qi, &quot;hu&quot; regulates the spleen qi, &quot;xi&quot; regulates the lung qi, &quot;xu&quot; regulates the liver qi, &quot;xi&quot; regulates the gallbladder qi, and &quot;chui&quot; regulates the kidney qi. These six terms correspond to the five organs and six bowels. The atmosphere of heaven and earth has its cycles: from the Rat to the Snake is the time of six Yang, and from the Horse to the Pig is the time of six Yin. During the Yang time, face east; do not completely close windows and doors, but be cautious of wind coming in. Then loosen your belt and sit erect. Knock your teeth thirty-six times to calm your spirit. First, swirl the turbid saliva in your mouth, rinsing it two or three hundred times, waiting until the mouth is like clear water, then lower your head to the left and swallow it, guiding it down with your mind. Wait until you feel it flow smoothly to your abdomen, then lower your head again, open your mouth, and first pronounce &quot;he&quot; to expel the toxic qi from your heart. While pronouncing, your ears must not hear the sound of &quot;he&quot;; if they do, the qi will become coarse and damage the heart qi. After finishing, raise your head and close your mouth, gently inhaling the pure qi of heaven and earth through your nose to replenish the heart qi.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>When inhaling, the ears should not hear the sound of the breath; if they do, the breath becomes coarse, which also harms the heart’s energy. Inhale briefly and exhale longer, meaning to take less in and let more out. After inhaling, lower the head and recite the word &quot;kē,&quot; causing the ears not to hear the sound of &quot;hā.&quot; After exhaling, raise the head and slowly inhale pure air through the nose to replenish the heart, ensuring that the sound of inhaling is also unheard. By doing this for six times, the toxic energy of the heart gradually dissipates. Then, inhale the pure energy of heaven and earth to gradually restore the original energy of the heart. Next, follow this pattern to recite the word &quot;hū,&quot; ensuring that the ears do not hear the sound of exhaling; then inhale to replenish the spleen, again ensuring that the sound of inhalation is unheard. Repeat this six times to dissipate the toxicity of the spleen and to restore its original energy. Lastly, recite the word &quot;xī&quot; to purge the toxins from the lungs, inhaling to restore the original energy of the lungs, which also needs to be done six times.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>Recite &quot;xu&quot; to expel liver toxins and inhale to replenish the liver essence; recite &quot;xi&quot; to expel gallbladder toxins and inhale to replenish the gallbladder essence; recite &quot;chui&quot; to expel kidney toxins and inhale to replenish the kidney essence. Do this six times for each, which is called the small cycle (Xiao Zhou). The small cycle refers to six times six, totaling thirty-six. With thirty-six and the six energies spread, the toxic gases in the organs gradually dissipate, the roots of illness gradually eliminated, and the gallbladder energy gradually completed. Observe which organ is affected; for eye ailments, recite &quot;xi&quot; and &quot;xu&quot; eighteen times each, inhaling to replenish during each session. In total, that makes thirty-six, which is called the middle cycle (Zhong Zhou). The middle cycle is the second set of thirty-six, totaling seventy-two. Then, again follow the previous method of &quot;he,&quot; &quot;hu,&quot; &quot;xi,&quot; &quot;xu,&quot; &quot;xi,&quot; and &quot;chui&quot; each for six times, with inhaling to replenish and exhaling to expel; this must be done earnestly without slackening, making this the third set of thirty-six, known as the great cycle (Da Zhou). Altogether, this sums to one hundred and eight times, referred to as the Hundred Eight Method. The noon hour is associated with the yin time, so if there is illness, face the south to perform this. The south is associated with fire, which helps to dispel yin toxins.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br>However, it is not like what you do after eating, facing east during daylight. For example, rising early and practicing the six characters six times each is known as the Small Circulation, and it can also heal eye diseases. Among all eye ailments, this method is the only one that can eliminate them, and the same applies to other illnesses. Remarkable! Remarkable! This is the benevolent intention of the Supreme. Briefly observe the genuine scripture on the jade scroll, and in detail, it can be obtained from a teacher. For those with severe illness, each character should be recited fifty times, totaling three hundred times to complete the circulation of the six organs. Then rinse and refine the saliva, clack the teeth, and repeat this for another three hundred times, followed by rinsing and refining the saliva and clacking the teeth as before. If this is done three times, it will total nine hundred times, leaving none unhealed. Keep it secret! Keep it secret! Do not pass it on to others. The &quot;Secret Scriptures of the Stone Chamber&quot; states: To nourish Yang in early spring: each day, close your eyes, calm your mind, and sit with your heart focused on the kidneys. Swallow saliva seven times, sending it to the dantian, then stand up and embrace your sides with both hands, gently rocking three times, like a respectful bow.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>Stand up and wait for your breath to settle, then sit again as before. Swallow saliva seven times, sending it down to the elixir field, and you will never be invaded by wind-related ailments. Doing this six times a month is sufficient; more would be even better. </p>
<p>For nurturing Yin in early summer: Every day, close your eyes and meditate, focusing your heart within. Swallow saliva fourteen times, sending it down into your heart, and you will be free from summer heat invasions.</p>
<p>For nurturing Yin in early autumn: Every day, close your eyes and meditate, focusing your heart in the lungs. Swallow saliva twelve times and send it down to the elixir field, then use both hands to grasp the soles of your feet three times. Wait until your breath settles, then swallow saliva seven times and send it down to the elixir field again before stopping, ensuring you will never suffer from dry heat.</p>
<p>For nurturing Yang in early winter: Every day, rise at the fifth watch (around 3 AM to 5 AM) and sit, focusing your heart on the two kidneys. Swallow saliva three times to send it down to the elixir field; there’s no need to swish the saliva. Use your hands to rub the soles of your feet until they are warm, then swallow three more times down to the elixir field and sleep again. You will be free from cold-related illnesses, as the method for longevity is contained within this. There’s no need for additional methods during long summer.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Nature of Ancient Times</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times during the era of Huangdi, when he was born, he was divine; though weak, he could speak, and in his youth, he displayed harmony. As he grew up, he became both earnest and perceptive, ultimately ascending to the heavens. He then asked the celestial teacher: I have heard that the people of ancient times lived to be a hundred years old, remaining vigorous in both movement and spirit, while contemporary individuals show signs of decline by the age of fifty. Is this due to a difference in the times, or is it the fault of mankind? </p>
<p>Qibo replied: The people of ancient times understood the Way; they aligned themselves with yin and yang and were harmonious in their understanding of numbers and sequences. [Note: Yin and yang are the beginnings and ends of all things, the essence of life and death. When one goes against them, disasters arise; when one follows them, illnesses do not occur. Thus, the ability to adhere to and harmonize with these principles is called achieving the Way.] They had moderation in diet and drink, regularity in their daily routines, and did not recklessly exert themselves. Therefore, they were able to maintain both body and spirit, completing their natural lifespan of a hundred years before departing. [Note: Moderation in diet and drink nourishes one&#39;s energy. Regularity in daily routines nurtures the spirit. Avoiding reckless exertion preserves one&#39;s essence. By nurturing both spirit and energy, they could coexist and complete their lives.]</p>
<p>Contemporary individuals, however, are different; they take wine as sustenance and treat recklessness as the norm. They indulge in drunkenness, reducing their essence through excessive desires, not knowing how to retain fullness, failing to manage their spirit in due time, and seeking instant gratification, which goes against the joys of life. With irregular daily routines, they decline by the age of fifty. [Note: Modern people pursue pleasure but are incapable of conserving their essence and spirit, which leads to their decline by fifty.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient times, the teachings of the sages taught that there are things to avoid, considered as empty and deceptive winds, to be avoided at appropriate times. They advocated for tranquility and emptiness, allowing true energy to flow, keeping the spirit guarded within, and thus illness has no cause. Therefore, with a tranquil will and few desires, the heart finds peace and has no fear. The body may work hard but does not tire, and energy flows in harmony; each follows their own desires, and all attain what they wish.</p>
<p>Thus, they appreciated their food, accepted their clothing, enjoyed their customs, and neither envied the high nor despised the low, which is why their people were called simple. Hence, their desires could not fatigue their eyes, nor could corruptive temptations confuse their hearts. Whether wise or foolish, honorable or base, they were not afraid of material things, thereby aligning with the Way. This is why they could live to a hundred years, still active without decline, as their virtue was complete and not endangered.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were true individuals who grasped heaven and earth, controlled yin and yang, breathed in vital energy, stood firmly guarding their spirit, their bodies were unified, allowing them to endure the ages without end.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient times, there was a truly enlightened person, possessing pure virtue and complete understanding of the Way, harmonizing with yin and yang, adjusting to the four seasons. They withdrew from the world and separated from worldly affairs, accumulating essence and refining spirit, wandering between heaven and earth, perceiving beyond ordinary sights and sounds. This naturally extended their lifespan and fortified them, leading them also to becoming a true human.</p>
<p>(Note: This is derived from practice and cultivation to secure one’s being, fully realizing true nature and returning to the Way.)</p>
<p>Next, there are the sages, who dwell in harmony with heaven and earth, conforming to the principles of the eight winds, moderating desires within worldly matters, free from anger and resentment, engaging in life without wanting to separate from the world. Their garments are simple and unadorned, they do not desire to observe the ordinary, their outward form does not toil over matters, and inwardly they are free from the troubles of thought. They prioritize tranquility and joy, deeming self-contentment as success, their body remains unbroken, and their spirit unscattered; thus, they can also attain longevity into the hundreds.</p>
<p>(Note: Sages can also roam freely and enjoy a long life of a hundred years.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are the wise individuals who align themselves with the principles of heaven and earth, reflect the sun and moon, distinguish the constellations, and follow the ebb and flow of yin and yang, recognizing the four seasons. They draw from ancient teachings, harmonizing with the Way, and can also enhance their lifespan to the utmost extent.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Balancing the Four Seasons and Nurturing the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>In the third month of spring, this is known as the season of emergence. Heaven and Earth together give birth, and all things flourish. Sleep at night and rise early, take wide strides in the courtyard, and let your hair down to relax your form, thereby allowing the spirit to flourish. Life should not be killed, give freely rather than take, reward without punishing. This corresponds to the spring energy and the way of nurturing life. To go against this harms the liver, leading to cold transformations in summer, resulting in fewer longevity benefits.</p>
<p>(Annotation: The rising spring sun nurtures all things, bringing forth new life; thus, all things thrive. Sleeping at night and rising early generates vital energy. Letting down your hair allows for the smooth flow of the liver&#39;s wood energy; moving slowly and gently corresponds to the warm energy of spring. To go against the natural growth of spring&#39;s energy harms the liver. If the liver is injured, it leads to cold diseases in summer due to fewer beneficial outcomes. When wood is harmed, it cannot generate fire; thus, during the summer, when fire should dominantly rule, it ironically transforms into cold diseases.) </p>
<p>In the third month of summer, this is the season of flourishing blossoms. The interaction of Heaven and Earth’s energies brings about the flowering and bearing of all things.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At night, sleep early and rise early, without weariness from the long days, allowing your aspirations to remain undisturbed. Let the blossoms and beauty flourish, and your energy finds release, as if what you cherish is outside. This is the response to summer&#39;s energy, the way of nurturing growth. To go against it harms the heart; in autumn, it leads to fevers and plagues, and those who gather are few, resulting in serious illness in winter.</p>
<p>Note: The yang energy is abundant and flourishing, hence it is splendid and beautiful. Sleeping early and rising early nurtures the growing energy. One should not grow weary of the long days, as the energy should not be idle. The heart is associated with fire and rules in summer; to go against the growth of summer energy injures the heart. When the heart is wounded, by autumn it results in fevers and plagues, especially as there are few who harvest. </p>
<p>The yang energy originally emerges from the lower yin organs; now in summer, if it is opposed high up without collecting in autumn, it leads to difficulties in harvesting, leaving nothing stored for winter. When yang does not return to its source, it means the root energy is depleted; thus, when winter comes with the cold waters commanding, there is no warm yang to counter it, leading to severe dangers of illness in winter.</p>
<p>In autumn&#39;s three months, this is the season of harmony and balance. The weather becomes urgent, and the earth’s energy becomes clear. Sleep early and wake early, rising with the rooster.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To keep the spirit calm and ease the burdens of autumn, gather and focus one&#39;s energy, allowing the autumn essence to be even and undisturbed, and thus cleanse the lung&#39;s energy. This is the response to autumn&#39;s essence and the way to nurture and gather. To go against it injures the lungs, leading to winter ailments and diminished nurturance.</p>
<p>In winter, during the three months, this is the time for closure and storage. The water freezes and the earth cracks; do not disturb the yang energy. Go to bed early and rise late, waiting for the sunlight. Ensure the spirit is subdued and hidden, with no hidden intentions or desires, moving away from the cold to warmth, avoiding skin exposures that would cause energy loss. This is the response to winter&#39;s essence and the way to nurture and store. To oppose it injures the kidneys, leading to springtime debility and reduced vitality.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The yang energy should be preserved and not disturbed, as this would leak it away. One should go to bed early and rise late to nurture and conceal this energy. By maintaining a hidden and reclusive mindset, one can avoid distractions. If there are selfish intentions or desires, the spirit and energy will remain concealed within. One should seek warmth and eliminate cold to sustain this yang. Yang energy is rooted in the greatest yin and manifests on the surface of the skin; if the exterior is not secure or dense, the inner energy tends to surge outward, which would lead to a loss of the skin&#39;s yang and hastily deprive it of its root energy. The kidneys are associated with water and rule over winter; if one goes against the winter&#39;s energy and does not store it, the kidneys will be harmed. If kidney energy is weakened, it can lead to conditions like atrophy or paralysis by spring, due to insufficient nourishment from the source.</p>
<p>The heavenly atmosphere is clear and bright. Its virtues are not only stored but also unyielding. When heaven is bright, the sun and moon do not shine clearly, allowing evil influences to invade the voids, closing off the yang energy while the earthly energy emerges. If clouds and mist are not refined, this results in white dew not falling. The connection is disrupted, and as a result, life cannot flourish. Without proper manifestation, there will be an excess of dead wood. Malicious energy does not manifest, rain and wind lose their seasonal order, and the white dew fails to fall, causing plants to wither and lose their vitality. Harsh winds frequently arise, and violent rains occur repeatedly.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heaven and earth and the four seasons do not support each other; when they are disconnected from the Way, chaos and destruction ensue. The qi of heaven is pure, clear, and bright; yet, the bright virtue is only hidden while operating vigorously and ceaselessly, hence it is unnecessary to call it &quot;down&quot; just because it descends. If the bright virtue of heaven were to be unveiled instead of concealed, then the sun and moon would not shine. If the virtue of heaven were not concealed, it would lose its pure, bright essence, allowing evil to take advantage of its emptiness and cause harm. If heaven did not continuously operate, then the earthly qi would rise and obscure its brightness. If clouds and mist are not refined, it is due to the earthly qi not ascending. If the earthly qi does not ascend, then the heavenly qi does not descend, and white dew does not fall. Though the qi of heaven and earth may communicate vertically, if it does not manifest beyond the six directions and nine provinces, then the lives of all things cannot receive nourishment and transformation, hence many trees perish. If malign qi does not emit, then the strict and severe commands are lost; if wind and rain are out of balance, then the governance of warmth and brightness is lost; if white dew does not fall, then there will be no moistening and nourishing mists.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Harmonizing with the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Since ancient times, the way to harmonize with the heavens is the foundation of life, stemming from the yin and yang. Between heaven and earth, within the six directions, the energies circulate through the nine regions and nine apertures, the five organs and twelve joints, all connected to the heavenly qi. There are five aspects of life and three kinds of qi. If one frequently violates these, then evil qi harms people. This is the root of lifespan.</p>
<p>The three refer to the three yin and three yang. The three yin are cold, dryness, and dampness; the three yang are wind, fire, and heat. If one cannot nourish oneself and frequently encounters these three yin and yang energies, then evil qi will harm one, affecting one&#39;s lifespan.</p>
<p>The energy of the clear heavens, when pure, promotes focused intention; following it strengthens the yang qi, which cannot be harmed even by malicious forces. This follows the order of the seasons, thus the sage transmits spirit, conforms to the heavenly energies, and connects with divine clarity.</p>
<p>If one aligns with this pure energy, then the body&#39;s yang qi remains strong against harm, even in the presence of fierce winds. This is due to the natural order of the seasons. When one is in a state of tranquility, the flesh tightens and wards off harm; even harsh winds cannot cause damage. This again is due to the natural order of the times.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the skin and pores is the essence of the five viscera, hence one should cultivate accordingly to the rhythms of the four seasons and the five elements. When the essence of the five viscera flows freely, a person will be calm and harmonious, preventing any decline in the body&#39;s condition, thus there is no way for pathogens to invade the pores.</p>
<p>Therefore, the yang energy governs the exterior over the course of a day. At dawn, the human energy begins to rise; at midday, the yang energy peaks; and by evening, the yang energy diminishes, causing the gates of energy to close. Thus, at dusk, one should draw inward, avoiding strain on the muscles and bones, and not exposing oneself to mist or dew. If this cycle is reversed, the body will become weak and depleted.</p>
<p>In the morning, human energy begins to grow, which is why dawn is enlightening; at midday, the energy increases, allowing it to overcome evils; in the evening, the energy begins to decline. By midnight, human energy enters the viscera, blocking the influence of pathogens. One should avoid straining the muscles and bones and seek tranquility, avoiding exposure to mist and dew. If this is reversed, the body&#39;s energy will be troubled and weakened by pathogens.</p>
<p>Thus, the sage articulates the harmony of yin and yang, ensuring the tendons and veins are balanced, the bones and marrow are strong, and the qi and blood are in proper flow.

<p>The injuries caused by the five labors are: prolonged viewing injures the blood, prolonged lying injures the qi, prolonged sitting injures the flesh, prolonged standing injures the bones, and prolonged walking injures the tendons. These are the injuries caused by the five labors. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: In ancient times, people labored without fatigue. Prolonged viewing depletes the spirit, thus injuring the blood. Prolonged lying causes the qi to stagnate, hence injuring the qi. The spleen benefits from movement, so prolonged sitting injures the flesh. Prolonged standing injures the waist, kidneys, and knees, thus injuring the bones. Exhausting one’s walking injures the tendons. Thus, these five labors injure the blood, qi, tendons, and bones governed by the five organs.]</strong></p>
<h3>Spiritual Pivot</h3>
<h4>On the Mind and Spirit</h4>
<p>What exists within me from heaven is virtue; what exists within me from earth is qi. Virtue flows thinly to give rise to life. Therefore, the essence of life is called essence; the interaction of two essences is called spirit; what follows the spirit is called soul; the essence that enters and exits together is called po. Hence, the steward of things is called heart; when the heart remembers, it is called intent; what intent holds is called will; based on will, changes are stored, referred to as thought; arising from thought, distant longings are considered as concerns; and pertaining to concerns, interaction with things is termed wisdom. Thus, in the maintenance of life by the wise, one must follow the four seasons and adapt to cold and heat; harmonize joy and anger, and stay peacefully settled; moderate yin and yang to balance hardness and softness; if done so, then evil and deviance will not approach, leading to long life and prolonged vision.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>In all matters of diet and flavor, the aim is to nourish life. If food is detrimental, it can cause harm. Unless one is taking medicinal elixirs, how can one avoid food? It is evident that people nowadays neglect regulation and care, leading to an increase in diseases and disasters; if one does not get ill from food, then to preserve life, one must be aware of what to avoid. The flavors of food may either be beneficial or harmful to the body. If suitable, they enhance health; if harmful, they cause illness, leading to serious dangers that are often difficult to treat. For all medicinal decoctions aimed at detoxification, although they are said to be for urgent relief, they should not be consumed hot. In cases of poisoning, consuming them hot exacerbates the condition, so they should be taken cold.</p>
<p>For liver diseases, pungent flavors should be avoided; for heart conditions, salty flavors; for spleen issues, sour flavors; for lung diseases, bitter flavors; and for kidney ailments, sweet flavors. In spring, do not eat liver; in summer, do not eat heart; in autumn, do not eat lungs; and in winter, do not eat kidneys; and throughout the four seasons, do not eat spleen. In spring, avoiding liver is crucial because the liver is dominant, and if spleen energy is weakened, consuming liver would further support it. Weak spleen energy is especially difficult to remedy. Furthermore, during the dominant time of the liver, one should not introduce dead energy into the liver, for that may disturb the spirit. If it is not the dominant season, then supplementation of the liver is favorable. The same principle applies to other organs.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Balancing Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Heaven is the source of Yang, and Earth belongs to Yin. Yang is the root of life, while Yin is the foundation of death. Between Heaven and Earth, humans assist in the balancing of Yin and Yang. Those who nurture Yang thrive, while those who cultivate Yin perish. The highest essence of Yang is the supreme truth, and the deepest aspect of Yin is the mysterious spirit. Therefore, those aligned with Yang live long, while those aligned with Yin have shorter lives. Excessive heat signifies the dominance of Yang, and excessive cold indicates the foundation of Yin. Yang acts from above, and Yin operates from below. The movement of Yang is swift, while the movement of Yin is slow. Yang&#39;s essence is light, and Yin&#39;s essence is heavy. When Yin and Yang are balanced, Heaven and Earth harmonize, leading to tranquility in human energy. When Yin and Yang are out of balance, Heaven and Earth are disrupted, resulting in human energy stagnation. Hence, when Heaven obtains Yang, it burns brightly; when Earth acquires Yin, it becomes cold.

Yin energy descends and does not rise, referred to as “cutting the channels”; yang energy ascends and does not descend, called “blocking the meridians.” The evil within yin is called turbid, while the evil within yang is called clear. Fire comes to the door of the Kan (water) while water reaches the gate of Li (fire). When yin and yang correspond with each other, there is harmony.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

The balance of yin and yang accounts for various ascent and descent. The upper passage of the yang spirit is three inches, while the lower passage of the yin spirit is also three inches. Yin should often be diminished, and yang should often be augmented. Between them lies balance, where yin and yang are harmonious. Therefore, the yang within yang is granted a title by the celestial beings, while the yin within yin is named by the earthly spirits. Those who follow yin often face depletion, while those who follow yang often attain longevity. Encountering this profound essence, there is nothing that does not resonate. </p>
<p>Yin and yang are the mechanisms of heaven and earth; the five elements represent the beginning and end of yin and yang. Without yin and yang, heaven and earth cannot exist; without the five elements, yin and yang cannot manifest. Thus, human beings are formed by heaven and earth and fail through yin and yang, born from the reversals of the five elements.

Metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and earth generates metal, thus the cycle of generation is endless. The lungs generate the kidneys, the kidneys generate the liver, the liver generates the heart, the heart generates the spleen, and the spleen generates the lungs, nourishing each other continuously without rest. Therefore, the &quot;Golden Chamber&#39;s True Essentials&quot; states: the heart produces blood, blood is the mother of flesh; the spleen generates flesh, flesh is the dwelling of blood; the lungs relate to qi, qi is the foundation of bones; the kidneys correspond to bones, bones are the source of tendons; the liver connects to tendons, tendons are the source of blood. The five organs and five elements support and generate each other. The cycle of day and night flows continuously without beginning or end. Following this brings good fortune, while going against it brings misfortune. The relationship between heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the path of the five elements is contained within humans.

<p>Bian Que said: The Yellow Emperor remarked that water drips down day and night at a rate of a hundred kè (刻). In a single kè, a person takes one hundred thirty-five breaths; in ten kè, one thousand three hundred fifty breaths; and in one hundred kè, ten thousand three hundred fifty breaths. In a person’s life, how many breaths are there! Alas! The ancients lamented over their passing; how can one not strive to do good to nourish themselves? I have pondered that in a day and night there are twelve hours, in ten days and nights there are one hundred twenty hours, in one hundred days and nights there are one thousand two hundred hours, in one thousand days and nights there are ten thousand two hundred hours, and in ten thousand days and nights there are one hundred twenty thousand hours. This accounts for thirty years. If a long-lived person lives ninety years, they would only have three hundred sixty thousand hours. Within a hundred years, in the fleeting moments, the span of life is like that of morning mushrooms and cicadas, hardly worth mentioning. Can one neglect self-cultivation? Yet one indulges in all desires, tirelessly seeking fame and profit, employing countless deceptions and craftiness to obtain false reputation, never satisfied until death. Therefore, the one who nurtures their nature knows this: whether fame or profit, it is as if they exist or do not exist; the same applies to what is not fame or profit. Thus, they live their life without peril.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I lament the many deviations of contemporary customs, where indulgence leads to demise. Thus, during my leisure days, I will briefly outline a treatise on nurturing one’s nature, to encourage the path of human virtues. Esteemed gentlemen of good will, join me in this cause!</p>
<p>To nurture one&#39;s nature means to cultivate it through practice; inherently, nature is good, and without practice, it is never beneficial. When nature is inherently good, inner and outer ailments will cease to manifest, and calamities and disasters will have no cause to arise. This is the great principle of nurturing one&#39;s nature. To nurture one&#39;s nature is to treat illnesses before they arise, and this is its significance. Therefore, nurturing one’s nature does not rely on medicinal pills or elixirs; it is found in the embrace of a multitude of virtuous actions. When virtuous actions are complete, though one may forsake medicine, one can enjoy longevity.</p>
<p>Without a full measure of virtue, even consuming the finest elixirs cannot prolong life. Thus, the sage says: a person who knows how to preserve life will not encounter tigers or rhinoceroses on land. This, then, points to the essence of morality; how can one rely solely on pills to wish for a long life? The reason sages developed medicines is to aid those who have strayed from the right path. Hence, the foolish cling to their ailments, year after year neglecting the cultivation of a single virtue, becoming entangled in diseases without remorse, thus they meet with the inevitable end. This is the reason for their enduring decline and final return.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ji Kang said: There are five difficulties in nurturing life. The first is the inability to let go of fame and profit; the second is the failure to eliminate joy and anger; the third is the attachment to sound and color; the fourth is the inability to end indulgence in flavors; the fifth is the scattering of the spirit and thoughts. If these five difficulties are present, even if one’s heart wishes to escape aging, and despite reciting profound words, savoring essence, and breathing in sunlight, one cannot avoid returning to one&#39;s habits, nor can one extend one&#39;s years. If these five are absent from one’s heart, then one will naturally ascend to virtue and integrity, blessings will come without seeking goodness, and longevity will manifest without striving for it. This is the great principle of nurturing life. Yet, there may be those who uphold benevolence and righteousness without heavy burdens; or are they merely a step below?</p>
<p>Zhong Changtong said: In the palaces of kings and nobles, there are countless beautiful women; in the homes of high-ranking officials, there are hundreds of concubines.

They listen to lewd sounds and delight in corrupt sights, never leaving their inner chambers and not returning from their external indulgences.

Once born, there is no means for care or nourishment; moreover, they are steamed with cotton and refined with various flavors, causing the fetus to be damaged and the child to become sickly and delicate, unable to gain strength. If desires are indulged, they produce one another cyclically, leading to ailments that beget further ailments.

He says that people should regularly consume the essence of jade spring in the morning and polish their teeth to maintain a healthy appearance, which eliminates the three pests and strengthens the teeth. The jade spring refers to saliva. Before rising in the morning, one should rinse the mouth until it is full and then swallow it; polish the teeth 27 times. This practice is called refining one’s essence.</p>
<p>The Book of Embracing Simplicity states: &quot;A person&#39;s body is like a country. The position of the chest and abdomen resembles palaces and halls; the arrangement of the limbs resembles the borders of the country; the joints are like the officials.&quot; The spirit is akin to the ruler, the blood is like the subjects, and the breath is like the people. To know how to govern oneself is to know how to govern a state. To love one&#39;s people is to secure the nation; to cherish one’s breath is to preserve one’s life. When the people disperse, the nation perishes; when the breath depletes, life ends. The dead cannot be revived, and the lost cannot be retained. Thus, the enlightened person addresses problems before they arise, treats ailments before they develop, and heals when there is no trouble, rather than waiting until after it has already passed.</p>
<p>Man is difficult to nurture yet easy to endanger; breath is hard to purify yet easy to foul. Therefore, one must be discerning in authority and virtue to protect the state; curb desires to solidify one’s health. Only then can the true unity be preserved, the spirit safeguarded, a myriad of diseases repelled, and longevity extended.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p>Even if one has taken herbal medicine, without knowing the art of nurturing one&#39;s nature, it is also difficult to attain long life.

<p>The way of nurturing life avoids prolonged standing, being stationary, sitting, lying down, staring, or listening. This is because prolonged staring harms the blood, lying harms the vital energy, standing harms the bones, sitting harms the flesh, and walking harms the muscles. One should also avoid overeating, overdrinking, excessively lifting weights, worry, intense anger, profound sorrow, great fear, stumbling, excessive talking, and loud laughter. </p>

Excessive thinking endangers the spirit, excessive contemplation scatters the will, excessive desire clouds the intention, excessive engagement tires the body, excessive talking depletes the energy, excessive laughter harms the organs, excessive worry frightens the heart, excessive joy overfills the consciousness, excessive rejoicing leads to confusion and mistakes, excessive anger disrupts the pulse, excessive liking causes obsession, and excessive disliking exhausts one and brings no joy. If these twelve excesses are not eliminated, then the balance of vitality and the blood will be disturbed, which jeopardizes the essence of life. Only when one transcends both excess and deficiency can one be close to the Way. Therefore, understanding not to rely on external conditions is the method for genuine practitioners at the beginning of their journey. If one can achieve this, they can dwell amidst epidemics without worry or doubt.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

Therefore, Confucius said: &quot;Think without malice.&quot; One should regularly practice the Inner Vision method of the Yellow Emperor, focusing on visualization and contemplation, ensuring that the five organs are perceived as if suspended and that the five colors are clear and distinct—this practice should not be neglected.</p>
<p>Every morning upon rising, face south, spread both hands on your knees, and observe the flow of energy moving up to the crown and down to the bubbling spring (the soles of your feet); repeat this daily; it is called &quot;welcoming the Qi.&quot; Regularly inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth in a calm and gentle manner, without opening the mouth too wide. If you wish to exhale less and inhale more, each time you eat, breathe energy into the abdomen, while the inhaled energy acts as the master.

Unbeknownst to them, in the aftermath, all these become the roots of their illnesses. When they find their hands empty and white sweat flowing out, they lament to the heavens, realizing they can grasp nothing.

It is best if one keeps their residence elegant, simple, and clean, without exposure to wind, rain, cold, or dampness. Clothing and utensils should not be made of precious jewels or gold; excessive indulgence leads to deep-rooted worries. Meals should not be abundant with rich meats; a frugal lifestyle is preferable. Then one can walk like a majestic swan, speak as if resonating with a bell, and sleep like a lion. Each day, one should sing: &quot;Delicious food must be chewed well; do not swallow raw food without savoring.&quot; In my dwelling place, it’s a large house surrounded by forests and villages.

Speaking while walking is discouraged; if speech is necessary, one should pause and then speak, as speaking while moving can lead to a loss of energy. On the Winter Solstice, one may speak but should refrain from excessive conversation. When someone inquires, one should not refuse to answer, but one should also avoid unnecessary speech.

Therefore, one should generally practice a light diet, ensuring that food is well-chewed so that the rice essence enters the stomach, and not let the essence of wine enter the intestines. When one eats, it is essential to remove worries. Consuming the five flavors should not lead to excessive anger, as this can easily disturb the spirit and cause restless dreams at night. One should not indulge in heavy meats, which often lead to various ailments. It is advisable to eat less meat, more rice, and a small amount of vegetables, while avoiding raw vegetables, raw rice, spoiled beans, and unclean things, and not to drink murky wines or eat dough that blocks the airways. Raw meat should not be consumed as it can damage the stomach. All meat should be thoroughly cooked and allowed to cool before eating.

Therefore, it is said that during winter, the energies of heaven and earth are closed, and the blood and vital energy are concealed. One should not exert oneself to the point of sweating, as it releases yang energy and can be detrimental to health. It is also said that during winter, the brain can freeze; in spring and autumn, both the brain and body can be frozen—this is the constant practice of the sages. </p>
<p>In spring, one should rise early and lie down late; in summer and autumn, one should stay up late before retiring; in winter, one should go to bed early and get up late, all of which are beneficial. Although one may say to rise early, it should not be before the rooster crows; and although one may say to rise late, it should not be after sunrise. </p>
<p>Whenever there is an unexpected heat during the winter months or an unexpected chill during the summer months, one should not expose oneself. Those who suffer from climatic disturbances do so because they violate these principles. One must regulate one&#39;s breathing and balance the cold and heat to avoid afflictions. </p>
<p>On the days of the winter solstice, do not sing or dance; those who do so will surely face calamity. Always burn white hair on the first day of the first month for good fortune.

<p>For anyone&#39;s living space, it must be well-sealed; do not allow any small gaps that wind might enter through. If you feel even a slight draft, do not force yourself to remain seated for long; you must urgently seek to avoid it. Prolonged exposure without noticing can lead to a stroke. Historically, sudden gusts of wind have caused limbs to become unresponsive, creating conditions where one cannot speak or may feel as if their body is bending back like a bow. All of this results from neglecting this issue. Once afflicted by wind, many ailments can converge, and the presence of harmful energies can lead to sudden death in nine out of ten cases. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain thorough precautions; do not take this lightly. Exercise extreme care! Additionally, ensure your living space does not block wells and waterways, as this can cause deafness and blindness.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

However, through many years of consistency, one can strengthen their bones and marrow, allowing the grains to naturally become effective. Nowadays, many people expect immediate results and seek quick fixes; when their internal organs are not well-nourished, they abruptly stop eating, diminish the essence of the grains, and the medicine has no effect. They then turn to women, becoming no different from the common folk, leading to their demise—this should not be surprising! The principles of taking medicine must follow a certain order. Those who do not understand this method not only suffer harm but also ultimately fail to gain strength. Therefore, in the proper method of taking medicine, one must first eliminate the three pests; after eliminating the three pests, one can then take herbal medicine; once the medicinal strength is properly absorbed, one can take wood-based medicine; after gaining strength from that, one can then take stone-based medicine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Maintaining Life</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Internal Canon&quot; states that one should follow the principles of yin and yang, harmonize with techniques and numbers, moderate eating and drinking, and maintain a regular schedule. Avoid excessive labor so that body and spirit remain together, allowing one to live to the end of their allotted years, departing only after a hundred. However, modern people are different; they consider wine as their staple, treat fantasies as reality, enter rooms intoxicated, deplete their essence through desire, and squander their true nature. They do not understand moderation, fail to manage their spirit in a timely manner, strive for momentary pleasure, and live without a schedule, resulting in decline by middle age.</p>
<p>Diet and daily routines are fundamental to a person&#39;s life practice. It is indeed difficult to want to maintain vitality and harmony with nature while indulging in excess and lacking moderation. The text also states: when food intake is excessive, it harms the intestines and stomach; a disturbed daily routine leads to a restless mind.</p>
<p>Therefore, sages align with the seasons—spring brings vitality, assisted by fragrant oils for the stomach; summer&#39;s fire thrives, aided by aromatic meats for the lungs. In autumn, one should consume oils and pungent foods to support the liver; during winter, warming foods should be consumed to nourish the heart. This is to assist that which is weakened.</p>
<p>Thus, the regularity of food and drink is essential for sustaining life. The key components are the five grains, five fruits, five animals, and five vegetables. The spleen and stomach rely on these for nourishment, the three burners require them for smooth passage, the channels of energy depend on them for clarity and impurity, and the bones and muscles need them for flexibility and strength. Therefore, the text concludes: the harmony of the five flavors prevents damage to the five organs, which is crucial for nourishing the body.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the five flavors nourish the body, if the flavor is too sour, it affects the liver&#39;s energy and the spleen&#39;s energy will be depleted; if the flavor is too salty, it exhausts the bones and muscles, and depresses the heart&#39;s energy; if the flavor is too sweet, it causes the heart to become congested, leading to a dark complexion and imbalanced kidney energy; if the flavor is too bitter, it dries out the spleen&#39;s energy and thickens the stomach&#39;s energy; if the flavor is too pungent, it weakens the tendons, and the spirit becomes weak. This is what is meant by losing the proper balance of the five flavors and damaging the body. Wang&#39;s commentary says: flavors can have excessive strengths, and organs can have excessive weaknesses. This is what it refers to. Diet nourishes the body, while daily activities regulate the spirit.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the sage sleeps at night in early spring and rises early, allowing his hair to flow freely, observing the time of the hair&#39;s growth, and says this fosters vitality. In early summer, he again sleeps at night and rises early, not being weary of the sun, observing the flourishing time, and says this allows the mind to remain tranquil and the energy to diffuse. In early autumn, he sleeps early and rises early, waking with the rooster, observing the time of harmonious balance, gathering his spirit and energy, and says this brings peace to the mind, in response to the autumn atmosphere. In early winter, he sleeps early and rises late, moving away from the cold towards warmth, observing the time of closing and storing, and says this keeps the mind concealed, as if having private intentions or personal gains. This follows the path of growth, storage, and conservation. In spring and summer, one nourishes the yang, while in autumn and winter, one nourishes the yin. By following the natural rhythms of the four seasons in daily life, one adjusts their spirit. The classics state that going against the spring energies leads to a deficiency in yang, causing liver energies to stagnate; going against the summer energies causes a deficiency in yang, leading to disturbances in heart energy; going against the autumn energies results in failing to gather yin, causing lung energies to become overwhelmed; going against the winter energies fails to preserve yin, causing kidney energies to plunge. This neglect of the seasonal energies damages the spirit. The wise follow the rhythms of the four seasons, not contradicting the principles of yin and yang, and do not lose the harmonious balance of the five flavors. Thus, both body and spirit endure for a long time, allowing them to fully spend their allotted years. Those who hasten their hearts and go against the joy of living have no need to discuss this path! Therefore, the sage practices this, the wise cherish it; is it not profound wisdom?<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　灵兰秘典论曰：心者君主之官，神明出焉。凡喜怒忿悲忧思恐惧，皆损元气。夫阴火之炽盛，由心生凝滞，七情不安故也。心者神之舍，心君不守，化而为火。夫火者，七神之贼也，故曰阴火大盛，经营之气，不能颐养于神，乃脉病也。神无所养，津液不行，不能生血脉也。人心之神，真气之别名也，得血则生，血生则脉旺。脉者神之舍，若心生凝滞，七神离形，而脉中惟有火矣。善治斯病者，惟在调和脾胃，使心无凝滞，或生欢欣，或逢喜事，或天气暄和，居温和处，或食滋味，或见可欲事，则慧然如无病矣，盖胃中元气得舒伸故也。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>An Essay on Nourishing the Heart and Regulating the Spleen and Stomach</strong></p>
<p>The secret texts state: The heart is the ruler&#39;s office, from which the spirit emerges. All emotions such as joy, anger, vexation, sorrow, worry, thought, fear, and dread deplete vital energy. The excessive fire of yin arises from the heart&#39;s stagnation, which is due to the instability of the seven emotions. The heart is the dwelling of the spirit; if the lord of the heart does not guard it, it transforms into fire. Fire is the thief of the seven spirits, hence it is said that excessive yin fire disrupts the nourishing energy of the spirit, leading to pulse disorders. When the spirit is un-nourished, the fluids do not circulate, thus blood vessels cannot generate blood. The spirit of the human heart is also known as true energy; it thrives on blood, and when blood flourishes, the pulse becomes vigorous. The pulse is the dwelling of the spirit; if the heart suffers stagnation, the seven spirits will deviate, and the pulse will contain only fire. To effectively treat this condition, one must harmonize the spleen and stomach, allowing the heart to be free of stagnation. Whether through experiencing joy, favorable events, gentler weather, residing in a moderate environment, enjoying delicious food, or encountering desirable sights, one can feel as if there is no ailment, due to the relaxation of vital energy in the stomach.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Regulation of the Spleen and Stomach</strong></p>
<p>One should avoid eating when angry. It is not advisable to be too full or too hungry. Meals should be well-balanced and warm, with a preference for grains over meat, and it&#39;s best to avoid meat juices. Cold and damp foods should be avoided as they hinder the growth of muscle. The yang energy may become dormant, leading to fatigue and pain in the limbs; during rainy weather, this can result in diarrhea and dysentery with white pus and blood, or bloody diarrhea disease. This is due to the stagnation of yang energy not flowing properly. </p>
<p>Excessive exertion weakens yang energy, so leisure activities like riding or traveling are encouraged; however, one should rest if faced with wind or cold. Proper balance in movement and rest is essential; one should not become overly fatigued. On sunny, warm days, warm baths are beneficial, but do not use excessively hot water that induces heavy sweating. </p>
<p>Avoid eating or drinking in a state of exhaustion; even if hungry or thirsty, one should rest first. Only eat or drink when feeling adequately rested, and limit activity after eating.

<p><strong>Treating the Unmanifested Illness Rather than the Manifested One</strong></p>
<p>It is better to nurture health before illness arises than to treat a condition once it has developed. Once the sickness has taken hold and medicine is applied, it is usually in vain. Therefore, not treating existing illnesses serves as a caution for physicians; treating before the onset of illness elucidates the principles of health preservation. Thus, if one considers potential problems and takes preventive measures, what worries could there be? This encapsulates the wise approach of not treating existing ailments but addressing the potential for illness.</p>
<p>For instance, preparing soil to prevent water: if one does not block its flowing streams, a surging flood cannot be contained. Preparing water to combat fire: if one does not extinguish its flickering flames, the wildfire cannot be stopped. If even the overflowing water or raging fire cannot be tamed, how can one expect to treat an already established illness? Therefore, it is advisable to sleep early and rise with the dawn in the spring, and to rise early and sleep late in the summer, allowing the body to remain relaxed, avoiding anger and fulfilling one&#39;s intentions, providing cool and cold food to nourish one&#39;s Yang. This is how the wise treat the unmanifested illness in spring and summer. In the autumn, one should rise with the chickens and await the hidden sun in winter to conserve one’s spirit and harbor one’s intentions, providing warm and heated food to nourish one’s Yin. This is how the wise treat the unmanifested illness in autumn and winter.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some say that when one observes disease of the liver, one must first address the weakness of the spleen; only then can the wood pathogen be prevented from spreading. When one sees redness in the right cheek, one must first purge the heat from the lung channels; only then can the metal pathogen be restrained. This is indeed the method of treating illness before it arises.</p>
<p>Now, to cultivate the spirit in accordance with the four seasons to prevent illness—what does this mean? It is the way of the sage to preserve life; it is the mark of the superior craftsman to treat illness thoroughly. The idea of treating the unmanifested disease before it manifests is elaborated in the &quot;Treatise on the Harmonization of the Four Qi.&quot; How insightful it is!</p>
<p>In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and the Celestial Master exchanged questions and answers, always prioritizing cultivation and care. They first discussed the nature of heaven, followed by the harmonization of the spirit. Once aligned with yin and yang, they then emphasized the adjustment to the four qi. They spoke of moderation in food and drink, and also emphasized consistency in daily routines. The earnest emphasis on nurturing life is intended to address potential ailments before they develop into serious conditions.</p>
<p>Later, Qin observed a noble from Jin with a disease in the diaphragm and advised, “It is beyond remedy!” Bian Que, understanding this principle, viewed the Duke of Qi&#39;s affliction as reaching the very marrow and declared, “It is beyond saving!” Alas, how unfortunate that the lords of Qi and Jin failed to grasp the principles of preventing illnesses before they manifest?<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Aptitudes on Food and Drink</strong></p>
<p>The value of the human body lies in the physical form bestowed by parents. Damaging the body for the sake of the mouth is rampant. While possessing this body, hunger and thirst arise based on desires. Thus, one engages in eating and drinking to sustain life. Those who indulge are often ignorant, leading to a lack of restraint in taste. Excess in flavors brings forth diseases. The emergence of illness is subtle and difficult to detect. Under the pull of gluttony, one suddenly loses focus. When illness becomes established, both food and drink are abandoned. This brings worry to parents, and despite numerous remedies, healing remains a struggle. In poverty and isolation, simplicity is well understood. If action remains unwavering, the body can also remain healthy. When air and essence are balanced, I alone suffer from ailments. Upon the awakening of regret, dust clears and the mirror is purified. It emphasizes moderation in eating and drinking, easy to say but hard to practice. Nurturing trivial matters can lead to grave losses, as Mencius remarked. The mouth can cause illness and also undermine virtue. Guarding one&#39;s mouth like a sealed bottle ensures there is no disarray.</p>
<p><strong>Aptitudes on Desire</strong></p>
<p>The essence of human life is intertwined with heaven and earth. The feminine principle emerges from the earth, while the masculine form arises from heaven. Together they become husband and wife, with reproduction as their purpose. In youth, blood and qi are vigorous; this is the prime of life. Formality governs the relationship, and timing is essential. The bond between parent and child hinges on this understanding. Yet, those who are ignorant indulge in lust without restraint. Fearing they may miss out, they are further driven by impulsive desires. Qi corresponds to yang and blood corresponds to yin – they are the spirit of the human body. When yin is balanced with secretive yang, my body embraces eternal spring. How can there be ample blood and qi without self-cultivation? What was meant for my sustenance becomes my downfall. Women in their indulgence possess many desires. In the serenity of the boudoir and harmony of the household, they flourish. Men in their indulgence, however, may bring ruin to their homes. Having lost their virtue, their bodies also wither. It is essential to distance oneself from temptation; only then can the mind find peace. When food and drink are delightful, the body thrives and illness recedes.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discourse on Eating Light Foods</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: The Inner Canon states that if essence is insufficient, it should be supplemented with flavor, and also mentions that the earth feeds people with the five flavors. In ancient times, at fifty, people consumed meat; now, at seventy, my son completely abstains from salt. Is this not taking the middle path? Why does my son possess such vitality and complexion? </p>
<p>He answered: There are flavors bestowed by heaven and those cultivated by man. The flavors bestowed by heaven, such as grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits, have a naturally harmonious taste and the ability to nourish and replenish the yin, which is what the Inner Canon refers to as flavor. The flavors cultivated by humans are mostly overly rich and heavily seasoned, which can be harmful and detrimental to one&#39;s life—this is the flavor you doubt. </p>
<p>Now, to refuse salt and strong seasonings is not truly to eat lightly. The salty taste of barley and millet, the sweetness of glutinous rice and yam, the pungent flavors of scallion and garlic, are all flavors. Do you consider them to be light? Those who are content with natural flavors have tranquility in their heart and a cooling of their fire; those who find security in rich flavors pursue excessive desires and have an overactive fire. What is there to doubt? </p>
<p>The Inner Canon also states: The yin emerges primarily from the five flavors. Are these not heavenly bestowed flavors? The five organs of the yin suffer from the five flavors. Are these not human-made flavors? The sages made provisions to guard against these things. When a person is hungry, they must eat. The glutinous rice, which is sweet yet light, embodies the virtues of the earth, and being fundamentally related to yin, is the most nourishing; it should only be consumed alongside vegetables.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who use vegetables as sustenance may, in times of hunger, suddenly overindulge or worry about overeating, which may lead to stomach damage. Therefore, vegetables assist in nourishment, facilitating digestion and ease—this is the benevolence of nature. The Analects say: “Though meat is plentiful, it should not overpower the spirit of eating.” The commentary mentions: “With host and guest bowing a hundred times and three rounds of wine, one avoids the perils of wine.” This reflects the teachings of the sages. Indeed, grains and rich meats are best consumed together. When one accumulates rich flavors without grains over time, do they not assist the inner fire and create toxicity? Therefore, those who eat while avoiding grains can do so, but those who do not avoid grains while eating will inevitably succumb to their toxicity. The Inner Canon states that prolonged illness depletes vital energy, which is the norm of transformation; when energy increases over time, it leads to premature death. Those who are accustomed to rich flavors seldom reflect on this. If one asks why flavor compensates for insufficient essence rather than saying it replenishes energy, the reply is: flavor represents yin; energy represents yang. To replenish essence is to seek its root, hence it is supplemented with flavor. Herbs like licorice, white atractylodes, rehmannia, alisma, schisandra, and asparagine are all rich in flavor. The scripture states, “Supplement the deficient,” which aligns with this understanding. The previous text suggests that when the body is deficient, it is invigorated with energy. Exhaustion causes depletion of energy, hence deficiency. Warming is nurturing; it preserves life and allows energy to replenish. When energy is abundant, the body is complete. Thus, it speaks of warmth without mentioning supplementation. The scripture states, “Those who are fatigued should be warmed,” which is precisely this intention. Those who follow the “Classical Formulas” do not realize this; all signs of deficiency are treated with warming and supplementary herbs, termed “warming supplementation,” yet they fail to grasp the true meaning of the scriptures.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The physician must cultivate virtue and cherish one&#39;s own spirit; this is where the difficulty in healing lies. If the spirit is depleted, perception will be impaired, and the appropriate medicine cannot be administered; even with a heart to help others, one&#39;s strength will be insufficient. If a patient finds that medicine or acupuncture is ineffective, it is usually because they do not know how to preserve their health. As the ancients said, &quot;It is better to protect oneself before falling ill than to take medicine after becoming sick.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Danxi, the works on nourishing the mind and calming the fire, one should observe the condition of the sick person at that time. Some may debate the preference for gentle nourishment, but they overlook that its true intention is for those with phlegm, fire, and yin deficiency. When a person reaches middle age, kidney energy diminishes day by day, and with indulgence in desires, they become weak. Taking Yang-replenishing tonics may lead to overwhelming heat. While temporarily consuming nourishing descent drugs may provide a sense of refreshment, over time they can worsen one&#39;s vitality and blood. Therefore, one must adjust their diet, avoiding all fried, roasted, alcoholic, vinegar, fermented, and dry heat-inducing foods to prevent drying out the blood; also, avoiding all icy fruits and seasonal vegetables to protect the spleen. </p>
<p>If one can consume mild and light food, the foundation of the five flavors will sufficiently replenish the five organs. This applies to caring for the elderly and nurturing the young. Consumption of meat and alcohol can bolster yang and stoke fire, causing internal injury and exhaustion. Those with weak vital energy, even if ill, should temporarily consume such foods to benefit the stomach, as noted by Dongyuan. However, moderation in diet is extremely difficult; not only meat and alcohol, but also etiquette and restraint must not be overstretched. Even rice and porridge should not be consumed to saturation; there’s a saying, “If you can eat three bowls, only eat two.&quot; Confucius stated, “Even with an abundance of meat, do not let it overpower your appetite.&quot;<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A brief note states: If the fleshly desires dominate, they obstruct the vital energy; if the vital energy dominates, it obstructs the original Qi. Those whose vital energy flows will have longevity, while those whose vital energy is stagnant will die young. Only wine in moderation does not lead to chaos; for the sage, it is acceptable, but common people should first know their limits to avoid disorder. Restraint in desires is not just about what is visually appealing or physically alluring; indulging in excess disrupts proper relationships and contradicts fundamental principles, offending the heavens, earth, and spirits. Even with one&#39;s own wife or concubines, one should not engage in reckless unions. Great winds, heavy rains, extreme heat, and severe cold, especially during the new and full moons, should be approached with caution and restraint. Only in stillness can one nurture insights and naturally alter one&#39;s heart. All vile and lewd acts should be abhorred, let alone one who would greedily covet and lose precious family treasures! When asked about nurturing and self-cultivation, the response is: there is not much distinction between them.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cultivation of the self pertains to distant realms beyond ordinary speech and doctrine; maintenance, on the other hand, is about the daily use of food and rest, which is easily understood and practiced by people. Thus, is there no cultivation? It is said: According to ancient texts, Shennong established the methods of medicine, and the Yellow Emperor initiated the techniques of guidance, which were passed down through generations, losing their true essence. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Eating and drinking in moderation, maintaining regular habits, avoiding excessive labor, and keeping one&#39;s spirit internal—how can illness arise from this? Therefore, one can live out their natural lifespan and depart at the age of a hundred. This is the true doctrine of maintenance. Having moderation and regularity without labor means that vital energy flows in accordance with its natural course, without the need for the burdensome efforts seen in contemporary practices. As for the internal manipulation of the Ren and Du meridians, prolonged practice can lead to carbuncles; prolonged manipulation of the Spleen can cause abdominal distension; prolonged manipulation of the Dan Tian can lead to hematuria; and prolonged manipulation of the cervical region can result in cerebral leakage.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Internal movement is indeed inappropriate; as for the six-character mantra, though it can disperse external pathogens, those who are internally deficient and have sweat should avoid it; the eight-piece brocade, while capable of moving qi and blood, should be avoided by those who are internally deficient and have fire. Only a few practices of ancient guided movement recorded in the &quot;Essentials of Medical Forest&quot; are clearly feasible, and these are summarized below. Ultimately, they are simply the dances of scholars.</p>
<p>When the spirit is inwardly preserved, the body and mind become stable, and there is no reliance on strong subjugation, resembling the quiet cultivation of today. The discussions on cinnabar, lead, mercury, and the dragon and tiger in the &quot;Book of Alchemy&quot; are all metaphors for body and mind. The principle that the mind and breath depend on each other is the most direct and obvious: the heart governs the breath, and the breath depends on the heart. When the heart and breath coexist harmoniously, essence, qi, and spirit are abundant, which leads to the avoidance of illness.</p>
<p>Should one live to a hundred years, death is inevitable, as it has been since ancient times; one merely should not hasten their own demise. Is there really such a notion today of transcending and ascending beyond the world? Some might ask: if nourishment and care are so easy and evident, why are there more who die young than those who live long? The answer is that in matters of diet, daily living, and actions, how can one consistently follow the heart&#39;s guidance without making mistakes? When fragrant wine and delicious food are presented, although they may be harmful to the sick, one often cannot resist them. Moreover, when desires stir within, even if one is ill, it is hard to suppress the danger. The intense heart for name and profit and overexertion goes unnoticed. This is the great difference between longevity in ancient and modern times, not due to differences in constitution, but due to the modern neglect of self-care compared to the ancients.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>He said: I know that by keeping the spirit inwardly guarded, one can manage diet and daily life appropriately. In that case, the movements both inside and outside are not worth seeking. By practicing quietude, one can gather the spirit, which is indeed the correct way. He replied: If one does not recognize the limits of a hundred years and does not let go of worldly attachments, then even if one&#39;s eyes are closed all day, it is merely a bundle of personal desires, and the mind is still in motion. However, if one understands the limitations and proper constraints of a hundred years, then everything will naturally follow reason, without greed, impatience, or falsehood, which allows one to avoid illness and live out a full life. If one focuses on energy, thoughts of life and death become mixed up and unclear, leading to a greater desire for stillness that eludes them. If one focuses on reason, human desires dissipate, and the mind becomes clear and joyful, achieving stillness without seeking it. What is commonly referred to as stillness today is likely different from the ancient understanding of stillness. He said: If this is so, then our Confucian scholars are fully devoted to this. He replied: The teachings of the sages are vast and cannot be comprehended by just anyone.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

Now, if one does not believe in the sayings of ancient sages but instead trusts blind and strange theories, it could lead to the ruin of families and loss of life; how misguided!

<p>Is it possible to preserve health without medicine?

<p>Those who honor life do not need to consume food or practice guiding exercises; they can clearly understand the nature of life and death, becoming almost like the Dao.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The world seeks longevity through consumption, which is a delusion! Even more so, some take supplements daily to satisfy their desires, which is an even greater folly! </p>
<p>The Shaking (Zhen) and the Receptive (Kun) represent the dynamic of external engagement with the internal. This manifests in the nature of emotional desires; thus, the sages take the meanings associated with Zhen very seriously in the I Ching. When thunder rumbles, the noble person reflects with fear and self-examination. As for Returning, it is said that the ancient kings closed the gates at the solstice, wanting to restore tranquility. In Following, it is stated that when twilight arrives, one should rest peacefully, desiring stability. In Nourishing, it counsels caution in words and moderation in food, aspiring for rightful sustenance. Understanding this principle, the inner fire will naturally subside without medicinal intervention.</p>
<p>At winter solstice, one yang is born, and at summer solstice, one yin is born; these two solstices are of utmost importance. The solstice represents the extreme; yin is situated in the birth of yang. This is a transformation from non-existence to existence; yin emerges from the extreme of yang, showing the different transformations of yin and yang. In contrast, the spring and autumn equinoxes merely represent a balanced division thereof. However, the most significant is the winter solstice; hence, the I Ching states that the ancient kings closed the gates at the solstice. The term &quot;closed gates&quot; must be understood broadly. The &quot;Monthly Orders&quot; states that in this month, one should observe fasting and seclusion in anticipation of the fixed interplay of yin and yang, which transcends merely closing the gates of the market.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Harmony of Nourishing and Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The sage clarifies yin and yang, harmonizing the meridians and channels, solidifying the bones and marrow; when the qi and blood flow smoothly, both internally and externally are in harmony, and malevolent influences cannot cause harm. The senses are keen, and vital energy remains as it should. Thus, it can be seen that harmonizing the nourishing and defensive qi is of utmost importance for the human body. If one deeply contemplates the mechanism, one will realize that the protective qi is particularly essential.</p>
<p>The texts state: when yang qi disperses, yin qi will also perish; the defensive qi serves as a golden fortress protecting the nourishing qi. It emphasizes that observing the defensive qi is the mother of all diseases, and defensive qi serves as the throat and tongue through which diseases and evils enter and exit. The Book of Changes states: the way is called one yin and one yang; thus, it supports yang and restrains yin, pervading everything, and the path of immortality is similar. </p>
<p>Ah! The energy of the nose connects to the heavens, and the energy of the mouth connects to the earth. People usually know to nourish the body with the energy from the mouth, but only the wise understand to nourish the defensive qi with the energy from the nose. Nourishing the nourishing qi often leads to excesses that harm life, while nourishing the defensive qi enables one to align with the celestial forces and connect with the divine, each differing by the lunar and seasonal cycles. There’s no need for further inquiry!</p>
<p>Question: What is the method for regularly harmonizing the defensive qi? </p>
<p>Answer: Every evening as the sun sets, the door of yang qi within the body closes; one must pay careful attention to protect it and not allow it to reopen. The texts advise to gather and defend as night falls, avoiding disturbance to the muscles and bones, and not exposing oneself to mist or dew, thus fully understanding the principles of harmonizing the defensive qi. Gathering refers to storing the spirit and energy within, while defending refers to warding off malevolent qi from the outside. Just like the door that closes at dusk and opens at dawn, what fear could there be from disruptive guests? Even during times of emptiness and the phases of the moon, as long as the energy within remains solid, how could external disturbances penetrate?<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cautiously Moderating the Five Tastes</strong></p>
<p>Question: If a flavor is overly sour, it draws the liver qi with its fluid, thereby exhausting the spleen qi. What does this mean? Answer: This pertains to the condition of a person&#39;s body. Wang&#39;s interpretation is forced and does not align with the principle. The innate essence of a person is entirely in the stomach. The abundance or scarcity of bodily fluids directly relates to the vigor of true qi. The stomach relies on the spleen to circulate its fluids; thus, the internal organs complement each other, preventing the stomach from becoming excessively moist and the spleen from becoming overly dry. Observing the following text about the flavor being overly bitter, we can ascertain that the spleen qi is not moistening, and the stomach qi is thick; thus, the spleen is too dry and the stomach too moist. Ultimately, they are interconnected organs that influence one another. Therefore, while the spleen qi is described as lacking moisture, the illness manifests in the stomach and is not severe yet. The excess sourness aids in bending and straightening, gradually drawing the stomach&#39;s fluids toward the liver, which in turn makes the liver qi feel enriched and abundant.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Excessive wood in the liver will inevitably constrain the earth, causing the spleen to be troubled, but it will not be completely exhausted. If the fluids in the stomach are still abundant, even if the spleen&#39;s essence is not nourished, there are still those that can be nourished; how can one then sit and await death?</p>
<p>Question: If the taste is excessively bitter, the stomach&#39;s energy will be thick; if the taste is excessively spicy, the spirit will be central. The note refers to thickness as strong and central as enduring. Can it be that among the five flavors, sour, salty, and sweet cause more damage, while bitter and spicy provide more benefit? </p>
<p>Response: The two meanings were originally not meant for this interpretation; Wang&#39;s note is entirely contrary to the text. Observing the stomach&#39;s energy as thick, and the spleen&#39;s energy as not being nourished, it is clear that the spleen&#39;s trouble does not allow for the stomach to transport fluids, leading to a buildup of energy in the stomach which becomes thick. Once the stomach&#39;s energy becomes thick, its capacity decreases, and in trying to compensate, it only leads to further deficiencies, making treatment even more difficult.</p>
<p>Today, people adhere to the teachings of a single school, the Eastern Garden, and when they encounter patients with stomach ailments, they uniformly apply fortifying methods. However, those who apply tonics and find themselves experiencing more bloating are precisely experiencing this issue.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>People from the northwest enjoy eating raw and tough wheat cheese, but when they fall ill, they resort to consuming cowherb and croton seeds before they begin to feel better. Spices, sand, oranges, and half of those remedies may not be effective; what then of using ginseng and herbs for nourishment? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when the stomach qi is full, it leads to distension, and when it is deficient, it causes diarrhea; this is evident. Regarding the spirit, which is central, it has been mentioned above that when tendons and meridians are slack, it indicates that the tendons and meridians relax and do not contract properly. Furthermore, a person’s spirit must be carefully preserved and should not be consumed in excess; can prolonged dispersion of energy not lead to harm? If it is said to be central, then the ailment may have sudden and violent potential. It is commonly believed that consuming too much spice leads to early death; is that not true? </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that the kidney is never without imbalance, and the heart is never without corruption, as the heart is the dwelling place of desires. When the vital essence is overexerted, both the heart and kidneys are affected, yet it is not entirely true. I have seen great monks and enlightened beings, who cultivate truth and meditate, suddenly experience disturbances in their energy and essence, realizing that the taste of excessive salt is detrimental. The notion of overexerting one&#39;s vital essence does not solely pertain to desires. Indeed, excessive salt in the diet severely supplements the kidneys, leading to a sudden accumulation of energy that encourages overexertion. Once the energy stirs within, the essence yearns to be released; even if there is nothing visibly desirable, one cannot suppress this urge. The texts state that vigorous encounters harm the kidney qi and damage the bones; this stems from the uncontrolled pursuit of desires. How is it that those who pursue purity and refinement often consume too much salty and rich food among their vegetables, thereby harming their body and failing to align with the principles outlined in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;? Once illness has taken hold and they adhere to a bland diet for years, it may provide some relief, yet it is far from as effective as moderating salt consumption in the first place. Thus, this matter concerns both aspects.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Food enters the stomach, and the essence and qi first flow to the spleen and return to the lungs, rising to follow the commands of spring and summer, nourishing the entire body; this is the pure qi representing heaven. It then ascends to the bladder, following the commands of autumn and winter, processing the waste and transforming flavors outward; this is the turbid yin representing earth. If one aligns with the energies of the four seasons, adapts their daily life accordingly to avoid the cold and heat, regulates diet, and does not indulge in excessive joy or anger to maintain mental clarity, desiring a balanced state throughout the seasons without preference for any, then one remains at peace. Otherwise, damage to the spleen and stomach can occur, with true qi sinking down or leaking out and failing to rise, which signifies there being autumn and winter without spring and summer. This leads to the potential for growth being hindered, caught in the destructive energies of decay, resulting in the emergence of various ailments, and even prolonged ascent without descent can also be a disease.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spirit Chapter&quot; states: If the heart is anxious and over-thinks, it harms the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, fear ensues and one loses themselves. The &quot;Evil Qi Afflicting Organs&quot; chapter states: Worry and fear harm the heart. The &quot;Inquiry Chapter&quot; states: Sorrow and grief move the heart; when the heart moves, all five organs and six bowels also tremble. It is evident that the heart is the commander of the five organs and six bowels, overseeing the soul and spirit, encompassing desires and intentions. Thus, worry affects the lung, thought affects the spleen, anger affects the liver, and fear affects the kidneys; this is why the five emotions are governed by the heart. If one can nurture this heart well, and dwell in tranquility, without unnecessary fear or exuberance, harmoniously adapting to circumstances without contention, and changing with the times without a sense of self, then one&#39;s intentions are in harmony, the spirit is stable, anger does not arise, the soul does not scatter, and the five organs maintain tranquility; thus, evil cannot affect one.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Care of the Body</strong></p>
<p>Laozi said: The reason I have great troubles is because I have a body. If I had no body, what troubles would I have? I would say: The reason I have great joys is because I have form; if I had no form, what joy would I have? It can be seen that what one possesses is merely the self, and what I rely on is merely the body. Without form, there would be no self; is this not the foremost duty of living? However, the significance of form is very subtle. As for movements, sights, and sounds, are they not all manifestations of this form? Beauty and ugliness, are they not reflections of this form? Courage and cowardice, wisdom and foolishness, are they not aspects of this form? Life and death, peace and distress, are they not related to this form? Human interactions are based on form; accomplishments are built upon form. The meaning of this form can be understood accordingly. </p>
<p>Yet, people are unaware of how to nourish their bodies. If they do not injure their bodily forms through emotions and desires, they instead damage their bodily forms through labor and toil. When the inner form is harmed, the spirit and energy are depleted; when the outer form is hurt, the limbs become impaired. Even to the point where muscles wither away, the form becomes evident; once the form is defeated, the life can be understood. Thus, those who are good at preserving life must first nourish the body as the dwelling of the spirit. Those who are good at treating illnesses must first address the body as the foundation for recovery. Although there are many methods for caring for the body, ultimately, understanding the essence of vital energy and blood is sufficient to encompass it all.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

There is true气 in water, and true液 in fire; without 精血, how can one make them rise and fall? The spleen is the foundation of the five organs, and the kidney is the source of their transformation; without 精血, how can one irrigate them? Thus, 精血 is indeed form, and form is indeed 精血. Heaven gives birth to water, which is the ancestor of form. Therefore, anyone wishing to treat illness must prioritize the body; anyone wishing to treat the body must first focus on 精血. This is indeed the great path for doctors. If one can understand this, then transformation can be boundless and divine use can be unfathomable. However, utilizing this method does not exceed medicinal foods, and among these, the most relevant is only a few flavors. Other variations based on individual tendencies are but supplementary aids. Just as in food, who among edible things is without benefit? If one seeks purity and goodness, most suitable for the stomach&#39;s气, only grains can be seen. If one asks me what is appropriate, I find it hard to articulate.

<p>The essence of life forms through the woman&#39;s vital blood, connecting with the maternal energy via the umbilical cord, which follows the mother&#39;s breath. After ten months, the baby is born and gradually grows into adulthood, but the seven emotions and six desires invade both internally and externally, leading to the loss of true essence and eventually death—this is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>I mourn for the people of this world and am sharing this excellent recipe to strengthen the foundation and protect the body. It enhances the original essence and eliminates various diseases, proving effective like magic. It should be performed once every year on the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Frankincense </li>
<li>Myrrh </li>
<li>Rat feces </li>
<li>Green salt </li>
<li>Dipsacus root (each 2 qian) </li>
<li>Musk (1 fen)</li>

<p>Grind these into a powder and have the person lie on their back after a satisfying meal. Mix the powder with buckwheat water to knead into a ring about an inch in diameter and 2 inches if the navel is larger, placing the medicine in the navel. Cover it with a slice of locust tree bark and then circle it again with the medicine, using a small amount of mugwort to apply gentle moxibustion.</p>
<p>Let the channels flow freely, causing cold sweat to pour off. Be cautious not to induce pain, as it can lead to a loss of true energy. Moxibustion should continue until the person&#39;s age is reached. For the healthy, moxibustion can be done for several consecutive days; for the sick, once every three days. Stop when sounds and pain arise in the abdomen, or when foamy stools are passed. </p>
<p>Only consume rice soup, along with some white meat and yellow wine, to enhance the medicine&#39;s potency. If suffering from wind or heat trapped in the skin&#39;s pores, add red lead powder to the medicine to promote easy sweating and facilitate recovery.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

<p>The heart contains blood, and the kidneys store essence. When essence and blood are abundant, the hair does not turn white, and one’s appearance does not decline, promoting longevity. In terms of nourishing medicine, nothing surpasses raw and cooked Rehmannia. People only know to consume the two types of Rehmannia but do not recognize that the two types of Ophiopogon serve as guides. Raw Rehmannia can generate heart blood, while raw Ophiopogon leads to that which is generated; cooked Rehmannia can replenish kidney essence, while Tianmen Dong (the cooked Ophiopogon) directs to that which is replenished. These four ingredients mutually aid each other, with ginseng serving as the principal for harmonizing heart qi.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ginseng: 1 tael</li>
<li>Tianmen Dong: Remove the core, soak in ginger juice for 2 days, soak in wine for 1 day</li>

<li>Raw Rehmannia: 2 taels, soaked in wine</li>
<li>Cooked Rehmannia: 2 taels, soaked in wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind the above with a stone mortar until it reaches a paste, or mash it well, dissolve in apricot kernel decoction, filter out the dregs. Ensure it is as fine as powdered sugar. Remove the water from the top, dry the herb powder, then mix in the ginseng powder, knead with honey to form pills the size of a large walnut.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medicine Pillow Recipe [from &quot;Essential Records of Life Preservation&quot;] </p>
<p>Treats headaches and dizziness. It is said: When the earth is thick and the water is deep, residing there brings no illness. Therefore, people seek places where the earth is thick and the water is deep. The soil should be firm, moist, and yellow; the water should be sweet, pleasant, and clear. The living space should be well-rounded and tightly sealed, with no fine gaps, to prevent wind and air from entering. Wind is the essence of heaven and earth; it can generate all things and also harm people. Initially entering through the pores, it gradually reaches the muscles, internal pathways, and ultimately affects the organs, causing significant changes. During the height of summer, one should not sleep exposed. From the beginning of spring until before the beginning of autumn, one should sleep with the head to the east; from the beginning of autumn until before the beginning of winter, the head should be to the west. Always use a medicinal pillow. If the medicinal properties of the pillow are excessively hot, the heat will rise; if excessively cold, the cold will harm the brain. Only a pillow that harmonizes wind and coolness is appropriate.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

<p>The above should be finely powdered, using one complete purple river car (preferably from a male fetus; a robust female is also good).

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To prepare bamboo utensils fully, soak them in flowing water for a moment to imbue them with vitality. Take a small earthenware bowl, fill it completely, and steam it in a wooden steamer starting from the hour of the rabbit until the hours of the monkey and rooster. Use gentle fire for slow steaming until it becomes extremely soft, then take it out. First, pour natural juice into the powdered medicine and mix it slightly. Place the mixture in a stone mortar and pound it a thousand times until it attains a paste-like consistency. Combine the powdered medicinal ingredients and juice thoroughly, and pound it over a thousand times by many hands into pills. This is the true energy of the cosmos, best utilized when one person supplements another—something little known in the world. </p>
<p>Doctors use fire to roast medicinal wine, to remove tendons and membranes, and also to add tortoise shell—these are great mistakes, hence the particular mention. All powdered medicines must be clean and should avoid iron utensils; use only stone mortars and pestles or stone mills to grind, preventing dispersion and far from iron. If the bamboo is large and fat, slightly increase the amount of powdered medicine; if it&#39;s dry, use a little honey. Daily, take one hundred pills on an empty stomach. For someone ill, take two doses a day. If there are bone issues, add earth bone skin and remove its wood, use motherwort without hairs, and wine-fry peony bark to remove its wood. If there is blood deficiency, add double the amount of angelica and rehmannia. If there is qi deficiency, add one tael each of ginseng and astragalus honey-roasted. If there is kidney deficiency, include one and a half taels of fried raspberry, fried fennel, wood-removed morinda, and seed-removed evodia—this requires pure meat flavor. For lower back pain, add one and a half taels of salt-water fried atractylodes, wine-washed rhizoma pubescentis, wine-washed and soft-roasted cynanchum, and wine-washed and soft-roasted fracture herb. For women, remove yellow bristlegrass and add one tael each of chuanxiong, fructus cyperi, and scutellaria, all wine-fried.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

This remedy was created in Chengdu by Cui Mo, who, desiring to have a child, intended to take this medicine but passed away before consuming it. An old slave, over seventy years of age, suffered from pain in the waist and legs, and walked hunched over. The Chu family administered this medicine to him. The old slave told the Chu family that after taking this medicine, he experienced remarkable efficacy—his ailments were all cured, and his sexual performance was like that of a young man. Subsequently, he became intimate with a member of the Chu family, resulting in pregnancy. One day, when this situation became evident, the mother of the family investigated the matter, discovered the truth, and subsequently killed the old slave, breaking his legs. The marrow was filled, appearing golden in color, and many tests showed effectiveness, thus it was named the Old Slave Pill.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

<p>Grind these to a fine powder. In spring and summer, refine with honey into pills; in autumn and winter, steam jujube flesh, mix with ten walnuts, pound to a mud, combine with the powdered medicine and pound a thousand times until the pills are the size of Paulownia seeds. Take thirty pills each time, on an empty stomach, with warm wine or salted water, twice a day. If taken for a long time, omit Tian Xiong and use deer antler instead. This medicine restores hearing, improves vision, and takes one month for the internal organs to become stronger; in sixty days, white hair turns black; in one hundred days, one’s appearance changes, eyesight sharpens enough to thread a needle with black spots, and one can wear light clothing in winter without feeling cold. If white chickens are fed with rice mixed with this medicine for sixty days, they will turn into black chickens.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

<p>Single Recipe</p>
<p>Method of consuming Poria: Poria is undoubtedly a divine medicine, but it contains red fibers; if these are not removed, prolonged consumption may not benefit the eyes and could make them smaller. One should slice it into small square pieces after peeling, and cook it in clean water in a silver or stone vessel until it becomes soft and disintegrated. Place it in a fine cloth bag and knead it in cold water until it resembles starch, then strain the powder and leave the fibers in the bag to discard. Use the powder mixed with honey in a moist, fragrant manner; steaming it before consumption is especially good. Pure black sesame, steamed and sun-dried nine times, should be crushed in water and filtered to obtain the white juice, which is then boiled in a silver or stone vessel until it resembles apricot jelly soup. Finally, add crushed jujube flesh after removing the skin and pit, and mix it with the Poria powder for eating, which is particularly remarkable.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Method for Consuming Di Huang: Take fat, tender Di Huang (Rehmannia) about one or two inches long, cut it off, and wrap the ends with thin paper. Coat its surface with pig brain, place it in a small plate, and hang it in a ventilated area for over ten days to dry naturally. Shake it out to obtain a fine yellow powder, which has a unique texture resembling a goose&#39;s tube. When this powder is added to boiling soup, it is also referred to as gold powder soup.</p>
<p>When it rains, place this in a wide container in the courtyard, and the resulting substance is sweet and smooth beyond description. It is good for pouring into tea or cooking medicine, both being attractive and beneficial. Consuming it without pause can lead to longevity. Additionally, spring water, which is sweet and cool, serves as good medicine as well. Dry it and transform it according to the energy of the Earth’s hexagrams, thus the heavens represent water. </p>
<p>I’ve heard from Taoist practitioners that if one can consume well water essence, its effects are similar to those of stone sulfur and other minerals; however, even those who are not practitioners can develop boils on their backs and heads upon experiencing it, as I have observed. Furthermore, collect well water at the right time of day, store it carefully, and after seven days, it may generate substances resembling mica. Taoists say that gold in the water can be nourished and refined into elixirs, which I have indeed witnessed. This is quite simple, yet one alone cannot achieve it, much less what is termed the original essence.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method for Consuming Pine Resin:</strong> The best pine resin is the genuine kind from Zhendingshan. Place it in a fine cloth bag and boil it in clean water to make a soup. Skim off the floating impurities with a new strainer and place them in new water. Discard any that do not come out after prolonged boiling. Add powdered fresh white poria, without processing it; simply peel, pound, and mix it well. Every morning, take three qian (approximately 9 grams) using a spoon, place it in your mouth, swish with some warm water, and then follow the usual method for cleaning your teeth with the resin. Afterward, drink a little warm water and swish and spit again following the same method. This can strengthen teeth, improve complexion, and darken hair.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Refining Zai Er Ointment:</strong> Both the Zai Er (a type of plant) along with its roots, stems, leaves, and seeds should be rinsed to remove dirt. Hang them in the shade to dry and then crush them into ash. Extract the concentrated juice from the ash and refine it over two stoves. Wait for the ash juice to reduce, then quickly transfer to a side cauldron to add the refined ash juice. Maintain a fire continuously for one day and night to gradually obtain the ointment, which should be stored in a dry porcelain jar. Take a dosage of one qian mixed with wine every morning and evening before sleeping. It warms the body, dispels wind, and improves appearance—its effects cannot be fully expressed. Particularly effective for treating skin conditions, making the skin smooth and clean. When cleansing your face or bathing, use a small amount like a soap bean for best results, with no restrictions. Su Changtu’s father, who advised the Scholar of Yizhou and lived in Yong, took this for over ten years and reached eighty-seven years of age, appearing rosy and vigorous, likely due to the power of this medicine.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Consuming Fresh Ginger:</strong> In the past, while overseeing the county of Qiantang, I visited the Jingci Temple, where there was a monk named Congyue Wang, over eighty years old, with a complexion like flushed cinnabar and eyes shining brightly. When I inquired about his abilities, it seemed he could diagnose pulses and know fortunes, much like a wise person. He claimed to have consumed fresh ginger for forty years, which is why he did not age. Ginger can strengthen the spleen, warm the kidneys, invigorate the blood, and enhance energy. </p>
<p>The method involves selecting fresh ginger that has no fibrous residue; however, do not use young ginger. The ginger should be crushed along with its skin to extract its juice, which is then stored in a container. After some time, the top yellow liquid is discarded, and the clearer liquid below it is collected and dried in the shade until it resembles fine flour, known as ginger milk. This can be mixed with steamed cakes or formed into small balls the size of walnut, taken with alcohol or salt rice soup, swallowing dozens of pellets at a time. Alternatively, the powder can be added to various foods or beverages. </p>
<p>Congyue Wang remarked: &quot;As a monk, I am poor and can&#39;t afford to prepare this properly; I simply chew the skin and swallow it with warm water.&quot; At first, it is indeed spicy, but after a while, it becomes pleasant. Now, I find it only sweet and delightful.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

Use eight dou of dewdrops to make a soup, divide it in half, and wash it twice. Then make an additional soup with two dou, adding ten catties of natron, and soak it in wooden containers for twenty days. Afterward, take it out, place it in a silk bag, and hang it in a room without exposure to wind or sunlight to dry. Use deer skin to make the bag and knead it. From dawn until noon, sift out the residue and knead it again to obtain five dou of fine powder, discarding the rest. Take one dou of this powder and mix it with two catties of cliff honey, stirring it into a paste. Place it in a bamboo tube, slice it thinly, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it under the southern slope of the northern wall, six feet deep. Cover it with soil. In spring and summer, leave it for forty days; in autumn and winter, thirty days. When you take it out, it should turn into water. If it has not dissolved properly, bury it for another thirty days. This water can cure myriad ailments and relieve fatigue, wind, and pain. It should be taken with one cup of warm water, three times a day. After ten days, the urine should turn yellow; after twenty days, the internal cold and dampness will dissipate; after thirty days, decayed teeth will regenerate; after forty days, one will no longer fear wind or cold; and after fifty days, all ailments will be cured, with the complexion improving daily, leading to long life and becoming a celestial being.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Lei Xia said: As for using muscovite that is yellow-black, thick, and stubborn red in color, which has been handled by women, it is not effective. The best is that which is shiny and clear like ice. For every pound, use one ounce of small earth gall, purple-backed daylily, sweet licorice, and prepared rhubarb juice, finely ground if dry, and extracted for juice if wet. Place these in a porcelain crucible, add three ounces of water from the Tianchi lake, and apply heat to simmer for seven days and nights, carefully controlling the water and fire. The muscovite will naturally form a jade-like paste at the bottom of the crucible. Then, vigorously pour in Tianchi water and stir. Remove any floating froth as it appears. This process should be done three times to purify it. Take one tael of agarwood and grind it into powder; use two liters of water from Tianchi to simmer the agarwood, dividing the water into three portions, and then re-purify the muscovite paste. Let it dry in the sun for practical use. The Baopuzi states: When taking the method of five clouds, one may use桂葱水玉 (cassia and garlic water jade) to transform it into water; or use dew in ceramic containers and boil it with original water; or combine quicklime in a tube and bury it to make water; or gather honey to make curd; or soak in autumn dew for a hundred days. Grind the materials with powdered herb or combine with the blood of the Ailanthus tree for use.

If the stone is effective, one pound is sufficient. If it is not effective, even ten pounds must be consumed. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of severing the three corpses: On the day of Gengchen, remove the fingernails; on the day of Jiawu, remove the toenails. Every year on the sixteenth of July, burn the nails and ashes, mix them with water, and consume it. This will eliminate all three corpses and nine worms, known as the severing of the three corpses. </p>
<p>Additionally: On the day of Jiayin, the three corpses wander in both hands, so cut off the fingernails; on the day of Jiawu, the three corpses wander in both feet, so cut off the toenails.</p>
<p>The dual alchemy of yin and yang: Those who refine autumn stones usually only apply the method of fire refinement. However, this medicine must combine both yin and yang refinement to be the ultimate medicine. Fire refinement is the yin within yang, solidifying in fire, dissolving in water, returning to formlessness, where essence departs but flavor remains. This is the vacancy within separation. Water refinement is the yang within yin, solidifying in water, moistening when exposed, unchanged for a thousand years, with flavor departing but essence remaining. This is the reality within the pit. Both substances originate from the heart and kidney and flow through the small intestine. </p>
<p>By utilizing the primordial, righteous qi of water and fire, one relies on the water and fire of heaven and earth to solidify into essence. Consuming this nourishes the sun&#39;s fire in the two organs, serving as the foundation of life. With an empty heart, consume the yang refinement; at noon, consume the yin refinement. This method is extremely labor-saving and not comparable to ordinary methods. Those suffering from chronic illnesses will find relief. Someone who has become emaciated and coughs, for whom various methods have failed, will heal upon consumption. Someone afflicted with a distended abdomen and chronic shortness of breath will also find peace after consuming this.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

Among fragrant herbs, its efficacy stands unmatched.</p>
<p>Take one pound of river pepper, remove any floaters and impurities, and then stir-fry in a silver container until it becomes translucent. Spread two layers of paper on the ground, pour the pepper onto the paper, cover it with a new basin, and surround it with yellow earth.

<p>The &quot;Medical Entry&quot; states: The navel of a person, at the beginning of life, receives the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood, which coalesce. In the womb, during the formless chaos when the supreme ultimate has not yet separated, the vital energy divides into two apertures, appearing like the four points of emergence, externally linking to the two kidneys, internally nurturing the red and white meridians. Among the four points, there is a division of exterior and interior. In the mother&#39;s belly, the mother breathes and the child breathes; the mother inhales and the child inhales. It is like a navel connecting as flowers and fruits on branches. After one month and one week, the genuine energy gradually becomes sufficient. Upon birth, the placenta has not yet detached, and the umbilical cord is loosely severed. If the navel remains open, exposure to wind or cold may harm the infant&#39;s true energy. Thus, by fumigating with moxa several times, the true energy will be safeguarded. At three to seven days, the navel closes. Only then does it feel deep in the mouth. Therefore, as yang becomes exuberant and ages, it indulges in the five tastes, is drained by the five sounds, and is affected by the five qi, externally exhausting vital energy and internally suffering from cold, preventing the smooth flow of true energy. Thus, laws are established to steam the navel and secure the connection, like watering the soil so that grass and trees thrive.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one frequently uses this method of fumigation, then harmony and balance are achieved, the soul is settled, and the body is protected from cold and heat, leading to good health, which has a certain marvelous effect. The lungs are like the canopy of the five organs, from which the voice arises. The skin and fur depend on it for nourishment, and kidney essence is generated from it. If the pores are not tightly closed, external pathogens can invade and cause internal injuries, resulting in coughing. External factors can disperse, while internal injuries can cause dampness. If there are blockages, they should be resolved. If one uses harsh or drying medicinals or fails to disperse, this can lead to stagnant energy in the lungs, producing excessive phlegm and causing wheezing and coughing. If there is damage from labor or diet leading to blood vomit, with sudden chills and fevers, feelings of fatigue, mental fog, a heavy chest, diminished appetite, and weak spirit, then these ailments arise. Physicians may urgently use medicinal pills like Baozhen Wan or Huatan Wan to treat these conditions. If they are ineffective, one must fumigate the navel according to the method.

When moxibustion is applied vigorously fifty to sixty times, profuse sweating occurs, from the Baihui point at the top to the Yongquan point at the bottom.

<p>The primary method: The practice of guiding and stretching is designed to address deficiencies in qi and blood. If there is heat, keep the eyes open; if there is no heat, keep the eyes closed. If there is no sweat, hold the breath to the limit; if there is sweat, it is not necessary to hold the breath. To let qi rise and treat ailments of the ears, eyes, mouth, and teeth, bend the body; to let qi descend and facilitate urination and defecation, as well as strengthen the legs, lie down; to allow qi to reach the limbs, lie on one side. To relieve headaches, tilt the head back; to address ailments in the waist and feet, straighten the toes upward; to alleviate chest pain, pull the toes; for arm issues, cover the arm. To dispel cold and heat accumulation in the abdomen and alleviate coldness coupled with body heat, one can hold the breath, fill the abdomen, and lie down; this can also be done. However, for issues in the head and chest, raise the pillow seven inches; for problems below the heart, raise it four inches; for ailments below the navel, do not use a pillow.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Switching Method: First, with the left thigh aligned with the shoulder, make nine circular rotations forward; then, with the right thigh aligned with the shoulder, make nine rotations forward. Repeat this with both thighs and shoulders, making nine rotations forward. It is also good to increase up to thirty-nine rotations in total. However, the practice should be done slowly and gently. It can also be done with a gradual start followed by increased intensity. This method clears blockages in the body, benefits the heart’s pericardium, and is similar in intention to Zhang Ziqiu&#39;s treatment for tuberculosis using the switching formula, effectively treating minor strain, back pain, and chest tightness.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of relieving stagnation: it involves swirling the hands in circles, moving them forward and backward, with the feet imitating the walking steps of a heron, without concern for the number of repetitions. After a long time, place the left hand on the right shoulder and the right foot on the left knee, then walk in a relaxed manner; switch to placing the right hand on the left shoulder and the left foot on the right knee, and walk in a relaxed manner. After a long time, extend the left hand forward to rest on the abdomen, while placing the right foot on the left knee and walking; extend the right hand backward to rest on the waist, while placing the left foot on the right knee and walking. After a long time, raise both hands vigorously to the sky and stomp the feet firmly on the ground, then move the hands downward and backward while curling the toes and leaning back to allow the breath to descend. After a long time, squat down and grip the heels tightly with both hands, while the toes push down, and lower the head as far as possible to the knees. After a long time, stand up and cross the hands over the arms on the chest, shaking vigorously several times. This method is effective for those troubled by unmet desires and stagnation, feelings of fullness in the heart and abdomen, and restless nights. Those without illness may also practice it.

<p>In the vast emptiness of heaven and earth, there is qi; within the human body, there is also qi. Therefore, expelling impure qi is the qi within the body; inhaling pure qi is the qi of heaven and earth. A person is in qi as a fish swims in water; if the belly of the fish cannot take in or expel water, it dies. Similarly, if the human abdomen cannot take in or expel qi, one also dies; the principle is the same.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one wishes to master the art of regulating breath, one should often eat early, close the door, set the bed warm, raise the pillow about two inches, lie flat with the body straight, close the eyes and grip firmly, keeping the feet five inches apart, and the arms also five inches from the body. First, one must hold the breath and inhale through the nose, gradually filling the abdomen, then hold it. When it becomes unbearable, one should exhale slowly through the mouth, not letting all the breath escape at once. After the breath stabilizes, one should close it again, starting with ten breaths, or twenty breaths, until it becomes unbearable. Gradually, with practice, one can increase this, but if one can hold it for over eighty breaths, then a pure flow of clear energy fills the organs and chest. When one has perfected this practice, at the time of holding the breath, there will be only a short breath remaining in the nose, with the held breath circulating like steam nourishing the lungs, making the body feel as if it is filled with a divine spirit. The experience is indescribably delightful. This is because the breath circulates freely within and without, reaching thoroughly up and down. As the held breath gradually dissipates, one returns to a state of normalcy. This method relies on consistency; if one can practice this twice daily, over time, one&#39;s senses will become sharp, the spirit will be complete, the body healthy and light, and all ailments will be eradicated.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When beginning to regulate the breath, it is essential to maintain tranquility and harmony, without contention with intent. If harmony is not attained, one should pause and wait for it, practicing until one does so without fatigue, which is good. Holding the breath should resemble the descending dragon or the crouching tiger; one must understand its spiritual nature. The chest and diaphragm should remain empty, not full. If the breath becomes stagnant and fails to flow, one should use exhalation methods to eliminate it, such as blowing, puffing, gasping, or sighing. Otherwise, the source will be blocked, leading to backflow, and the troubles of sores and conditions will emerge.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: &quot;Exhaling and inhaling, discarding the old and taking in the new, is merely an extension of life.&quot; This is what practitioners of guidance and those who nurture life, like Peng Zu who lived long, appreciate. Therefore, it is known that the art of guidance has been passed down since ancient times. Thus, it is said that Peng Zu’s preferences originate from discussions among self-cultivators and medical practitioners, encompassing several hundred teachings.

Then, use both hands to embrace your neck, turning left and right for twenty-four times; this helps to eliminate the wind and pathogens accumulated in the chest and sides. Next, cross both hands, support empty space as if holding up the heavens, and press your hands against your neck twenty-four times; this helps to dispel the evil energy in the chest and diaphragm. Again, grab both hands, press on the left knee and twist the body to the left, press on the right knee and twist to the right, for twenty-four times; this can remove wind evil from the liver. Then, stretch your left hand forward and your right hand backward, as if drawing a bow, for twenty-four times; this can clear the accumulated evil from the kidneys.

<p>The &quot;Six Characters Breathing Formula&quot; from the Taishang Yuzhu: The Daoist canon contains the &quot;Yuzhu Sutra,&quot; which discusses the qi of the five organs and six bowels. Imbalances from the five flavors, combined with the six desires and seven feelings, can lead to illnesses over time, injuring the organs internally and attacking the nine orifices externally, resulting in diseases throughout the body. Mild cases may result in chronic ailments, severe cases in blindness or disability, and worst cases can lead to death. Therefore, Taishang shows compassion. This six-character breathing formula addresses the illnesses of the five organs and six bowels. The method involves exhaling to release toxic gases from the organs and inhaling to gather the pure qi of heaven and earth. There are small results in one day, significant results in ten days, and after a year, one will be free from all ailments.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a></p></div>

Breathing has six forms: he, hu, xi, xu, xi, and chui; these are all types of exhalation. Inhalation is just one type. The six forms serve to regulate the qi of the six organs: &quot;he&quot; regulates the heart qi, &quot;hu&quot; regulates the spleen qi, &quot;xi&quot; regulates the lung qi, &quot;xu&quot; regulates the liver qi, &quot;xi&quot; regulates the gallbladder qi, and &quot;chui&quot; regulates the kidney qi. These six terms correspond to the five organs and six bowels. The atmosphere of heaven and earth has its cycles: from the Rat to the Snake is the time of six Yang, and from the Horse to the Pig is the time of six Yin. During the Yang time, face east; do not completely close windows and doors, but be cautious of wind coming in. Then loosen your belt and sit erect. Knock your teeth thirty-six times to calm your spirit. First, swirl the turbid saliva in your mouth, rinsing it two or three hundred times, waiting until the mouth is like clear water, then lower your head to the left and swallow it, guiding it down with your mind. Wait until you feel it flow smoothly to your abdomen, then lower your head again, open your mouth, and first pronounce &quot;he&quot; to expel the toxic qi from your heart. While pronouncing, your ears must not hear the sound of &quot;he&quot;; if they do, the qi will become coarse and damage the heart qi. After finishing, raise your head and close your mouth, gently inhaling the pure qi of heaven and earth through your nose to replenish the heart qi.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a></p></div>

Next, follow this pattern to recite the word &quot;hū,&quot; ensuring that the ears do not hear the sound of exhaling; then inhale to replenish the spleen, again ensuring that the sound of inhalation is unheard.

With thirty-six and the six energies spread, the toxic gases in the organs gradually dissipate, the roots of illness gradually eliminated, and the gallbladder energy gradually completed. Observe which organ is affected; for eye ailments, recite &quot;xi&quot; and &quot;xu&quot; eighteen times each, inhaling to replenish during each session.

As he grew up, he became both earnest and perceptive, ultimately ascending to the heavens. He then asked the celestial teacher: I have heard that the people of ancient times lived to be a hundred years old, remaining vigorous in both movement and spirit, while contemporary individuals show signs of decline by the age of fifty. Is this due to a difference in the times, or is it the fault of mankind? Qibo replied: The people of ancient times understood the Way; they aligned themselves with yin and yang and were harmonious in their understanding of numbers and sequences. [Note: Yin and yang are the beginnings and ends of all things, the essence of life and death. When one goes against them, disasters arise; when one follows them, illnesses do not occur. Thus, the ability to adhere to and harmonize with these principles is called achieving the Way.] They had moderation in diet and drink, regularity in their daily routines, and did not recklessly exert themselves. Therefore, they were able to maintain both body and spirit, completing their natural lifespan of a hundred years before departing. [Note: Moderation in diet and drink nourishes one's energy. Regularity in daily routines nurtures the spirit. Avoiding reckless exertion preserves one's essence. By nurturing both spirit and energy, they could coexist and complete their lives.] Contemporary individuals, however, are different; they take wine as sustenance and treat recklessness as the norm. They indulge in drunkenness, reducing their essence through excessive desires, not knowing how to retain fullness, failing to manage their spirit in due time, and seeking instant gratification, which goes against the joys of life. With irregular daily routines, they decline by the age of fifty. [Note: Modern people pursue pleasure but are incapable of conserving their essence and spirit, which leads to their decline by fifty.]"},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"In ancient times, the teachings of the sages taught that there are things to avoid, considered as empty and deceptive winds, to be avoided at appropriate times.

Therefore, with a tranquil will and few desires, the heart finds peace and has no fear. The body may work hard but does not tire, and energy flows in harmony; each follows their own desires, and all attain what they wish. Thus, they appreciated their food, accepted their clothing, enjoyed their customs, and neither envied the high nor despised the low, which is why their people were called simple. Hence, their desires could not fatigue their eyes, nor could corruptive temptations confuse their hearts. Whether wise or foolish, honorable or base, they were not afraid of material things, thereby aligning with the Way. This is why they could live to a hundred years, still active without decline, as their virtue was complete and not endangered.

This naturally extended their lifespan and fortified them, leading them also to becoming a true human. (Note: This is derived from practice and cultivation to secure one’s being, fully realizing true nature and returning to the Way.) Next, there are the sages, who dwell in harmony with heaven and earth, conforming to the principles of the eight winds, moderating desires within worldly matters, free from anger and resentment, engaging in life without wanting to separate from the world. Their garments are simple and unadorned, they do not desire to observe the ordinary, their outward form does not toil over matters, and inwardly they are free from the troubles of thought. They prioritize tranquility and joy, deeming self-contentment as success, their body remains unbroken, and their spirit unscattered; thus, they can also attain longevity into the hundreds. (Note: Sages can also roam freely and enjoy a long life of a hundred years.) Furthermore, there are the wise individuals who align themselves with the principles of heaven and earth, reflect the sun and moon, distinguish the constellations, and follow the ebb and flow of yin and yang, recognizing the four seasons.

Life should not be killed, give freely rather than take, reward without punishing. This corresponds to the spring energy and the way of nurturing life. To go against this harms the liver, leading to cold transformations in summer, resulting in fewer longevity benefits. (Annotation: The rising spring sun nurtures all things, bringing forth new life; thus, all things thrive. Sleeping at night and rising early generates vital energy. Letting down your hair allows for the smooth flow of the liver's wood energy; moving slowly and gently corresponds to the warm energy of spring. To go against the natural growth of spring's energy harms the liver. If the liver is injured, it leads to cold diseases in summer due to fewer beneficial outcomes. When wood is harmed, it cannot generate fire; thus, during the summer, when fire should dominantly rule, it ironically transforms into cold diseases.)

Note: The yang energy is abundant and flourishing, hence it is splendid and beautiful. Sleeping early and rising early nurtures the growing energy. One should not grow weary of the long days, as the energy should not be idle. The heart is associated with fire and rules in summer; to go against the growth of summer energy injures the heart. When the heart is wounded, by autumn it results in fevers and plagues, especially as there are few who harvest. The yang energy originally emerges from the lower yin organs; now in summer, if it is opposed high up without collecting in autumn, it leads to difficulties in harvesting, leaving nothing stored for winter. When yang does not return to its source, it means the root energy is depleted; thus, when winter comes with the cold waters commanding, there is no warm yang to counter it, leading to severe dangers of illness in winter.

In winter, during the three months, this is the time for closure and storage. The water freezes and the earth cracks; do not disturb the yang energy. Go to bed early and rise late, waiting for the sunlight. Ensure the spirit is subdued and hidden, with no hidden intentions or desires, moving away from the cold to warmth, avoiding skin exposures that would cause energy loss.

Yang energy is rooted in the greatest yin and manifests on the surface of the skin; if the exterior is not secure or dense, the inner energy tends to surge outward, which would lead to a loss of the skin's yang and hastily deprive it of its root energy. The kidneys are associated with water and rule over winter; if one goes against the winter's energy and does not store it, the kidneys will be harmed. If kidney energy is weakened, it can lead to conditions like atrophy or paralysis by spring, due to insufficient nourishment from the source. The heavenly atmosphere is clear and bright. Its virtues are not only stored but also unyielding. When heaven is bright, the sun and moon do not shine clearly, allowing evil influences to invade the voids, closing off the yang energy while the earthly energy emerges.

Thus, in the maintenance of life by the wise, one must follow the four seasons and adapt to cold and heat; harmonize joy and anger, and stay peacefully settled; moderate yin and yang to balance hardness and softness; if done so, then evil and deviance will not approach, leading to long life and prolonged vision. **[Note: Therefore, the wise follow and embody the nature of heaven and earth to attain the way of nurturing life.]**"},{"anchor":"trans-17p","marker":"17p","type":"translation","text":"**Chapter on the Five Tastes** The five tastes that enter the mouth each have their pathways and their respective ailments.

When nature is inherently good, inner and outer ailments will cease to manifest, and calamities and disasters will have no cause to arise. This is the great principle of nurturing one's nature. To nurture one's nature is to treat illnesses before they arise, and this is its significance. Therefore, nurturing one’s nature does not rely on medicinal pills or elixirs; it is found in the embrace of a multitude of virtuous actions.

The pulse is the dwelling of the spirit; if the heart suffers stagnation, the seven spirits will deviate, and the pulse will contain only fire. To effectively treat this condition, one must harmonize the spleen and stomach, allowing the heart to be free of stagnation.

Therefore, not treating existing illnesses serves as a caution for physicians; treating before the onset of illness elucidates the principles of health preservation. Thus, if one considers potential problems and takes preventive measures, what worries could there be? This encapsulates the wise approach of not treating existing ailments but addressing the potential for illness. For instance, preparing soil to prevent water: if one does not block its flowing streams, a surging flood cannot be contained. Preparing water to combat fire: if one does not extinguish its flickering flames, the wildfire cannot be stopped. If even the overflowing water or raging fire cannot be tamed, how can one expect to treat an already established illness?

This is indeed the method of treating illness before it arises. Now, to cultivate the spirit in accordance with the four seasons to prevent illness—what does this mean? It is the way of the sage to preserve life; it is the mark of the superior craftsman to treat illness thoroughly. The idea of treating the unmanifested disease before it manifests is elaborated in the \"Treatise on the Harmonization of the Four Qi.\" How insightful it is! In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and the Celestial Master exchanged questions and answers, always prioritizing cultivation and care. They first discussed the nature of heaven, followed by the harmonization of the spirit. Once aligned with yin and yang, they then emphasized the adjustment to the four qi. They spoke of moderation in food and drink, and also emphasized consistency in daily routines. The earnest emphasis on nurturing life is intended to address potential ailments before they develop into serious conditions. Later, Qin observed a noble from Jin with a disease in the diaphragm and advised, “It is beyond remedy!” Bian Que, understanding this principle, viewed the Duke of Qi's affliction as reaching the very marrow and declared, “It is beyond saving!” Alas, how unfortunate that the lords of Qi and Jin failed to grasp the principles of preventing illnesses before they manifest?"},{"anchor":"trans-67p","marker":"67p","type":"translation","text":"**Aptitudes on Food and Drink** The value of the human body lies in the physical form bestowed by parents. Damaging the body for the sake of the mouth is rampant. While possessing this body, hunger and thirst arise based on desires. Thus, one engages in eating and drinking to sustain life. Those who indulge are often ignorant, leading to a lack of restraint in taste. Excess in flavors brings forth diseases. The emergence of illness is subtle and difficult to detect. Under the pull of gluttony, one suddenly loses focus. When illness becomes established, both food and drink are abandoned. This brings worry to parents, and despite numerous remedies, healing remains a struggle. In poverty and isolation, simplicity is well understood. If action remains unwavering, the body can also remain healthy. When air and essence are balanced, I alone suffer from ailments. Upon the awakening of regret, dust clears and the mirror is purified. It emphasizes moderation in eating and drinking, easy to say but hard to practice. Nurturing trivial matters can lead to grave losses, as Mencius remarked.

The feminine principle emerges from the earth, while the masculine form arises from heaven. Together they become husband and wife, with reproduction as their purpose. In youth, blood and qi are vigorous; this is the prime of life. Formality governs the relationship, and timing is essential. The bond between parent and child hinges on this understanding. Yet, those who are ignorant indulge in lust without restraint. Fearing they may miss out, they are further driven by impulsive desires. Qi corresponds to yang and blood corresponds to yin – they are the spirit of the human body. When yin is balanced with secretive yang, my body embraces eternal spring. How can there be ample blood and qi without self-cultivation? What was meant for my sustenance becomes my downfall. Women in their indulgence possess many desires. In the serenity of the boudoir and harmony of the household, they flourish. Men in their indulgence, however, may bring ruin to their homes. Having lost their virtue, their bodies also wither.

In ancient times, at fifty, people consumed meat; now, at seventy, my son completely abstains from salt. Is this not taking the middle path? Why does my son possess such vitality and complexion? He answered: There are flavors bestowed by heaven and those cultivated by man. The flavors bestowed by heaven, such as grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits, have a naturally harmonious taste and the ability to nourish and replenish the yin, which is what the Inner Canon refers to as flavor. The flavors cultivated by humans are mostly overly rich and heavily seasoned, which can be harmful and detrimental to one's life—this is the flavor you doubt. Now, to refuse salt and strong seasonings is not truly to eat lightly. The salty taste of barley and millet, the sweetness of glutinous rice and yam, the pungent flavors of scallion and garlic, are all flavors. Do you consider them to be light? Those who are content with natural flavors have tranquility in their heart and a cooling of their fire; those who find security in rich flavors pursue excessive desires and have an overactive fire. What is there to doubt? The Inner Canon also states: The yin emerges primarily from the five flavors. Are these not heavenly bestowed flavors? The five organs of the yin suffer from the five flavors. Are these not human-made flavors? The sages made provisions to guard against these things. When a person is hungry, they must eat.

The Analects say: “Though meat is plentiful, it should not overpower the spirit of eating.” The commentary mentions: “With host and guest bowing a hundred times and three rounds of wine, one avoids the perils of wine.” This reflects the teachings of the sages. Indeed, grains and rich meats are best consumed together. When one accumulates rich flavors without grains over time, do they not assist the inner fire and create toxicity? Therefore, those who eat while avoiding grains can do so, but those who do not avoid grains while eating will inevitably succumb to their toxicity. The Inner Canon states that prolonged illness depletes vital energy, which is the norm of transformation; when energy increases over time, it leads to premature death. Those who are accustomed to rich flavors seldom reflect on this. If one asks why flavor compensates for insufficient essence rather than saying it replenishes energy, the reply is: flavor represents yin; energy represents yang. To replenish essence is to seek its root, hence it is supplemented with flavor. Herbs like licorice, white atractylodes, rehmannia, alisma, schisandra, and asparagine are all rich in flavor. The scripture states, “Supplement the deficient,” which aligns with this understanding. The previous text suggests that when the body is deficient, it is invigorated with energy. Exhaustion causes depletion of energy, hence deficiency. Warming is nurturing; it preserves life and allows energy to replenish. When energy is abundant, the body is complete. Thus, it speaks of warmth without mentioning supplementation. The scripture states, “Those who are fatigued should be warmed,” which is precisely this intention.

The innate essence of a person is entirely in the stomach. The abundance or scarcity of bodily fluids directly relates to the vigor of true qi. The stomach relies on the spleen to circulate its fluids; thus, the internal organs complement each other, preventing the stomach from becoming excessively moist and the spleen from becoming overly dry.

Ultimately, they are interconnected organs that influence one another. Therefore, while the spleen qi is described as lacking moisture, the illness manifests in the stomach and is not severe yet.

Observing the stomach's energy as thick, and the spleen's energy as not being nourished, it is clear that the spleen's trouble does not allow for the stomach to transport fluids, leading to a buildup of energy in the stomach which becomes thick.

Indeed, excessive salt in the diet severely supplements the kidneys, leading to a sudden accumulation of energy that encourages overexertion. Once the energy stirs within, the essence yearns to be released; even if there is nothing visibly desirable, one cannot suppress this urge. The texts state that vigorous encounters harm the kidney qi and damage the bones; this stems from the uncontrolled pursuit of desires. How is it that those who pursue purity and refinement often consume too much salty and rich food among their vegetables, thereby harming their body and failing to align with the principles outlined in the \"Inner Canon\"? Once illness has taken hold and they adhere to a bland diet for years, it may provide some relief, yet it is far from as effective as moderating salt consumption in the first place. Thus, this matter concerns both aspects."},{"anchor":"trans-84p","marker":"84p","type":"translation","text":"Food enters the stomach, and the essence and qi first flow to the spleen and return to the lungs, rising to follow the commands of spring and summer, nourishing the entire body; this is the pure qi representing heaven. It then ascends to the bladder, following the commands of autumn and winter, processing the waste and transforming flavors outward; this is the turbid yin representing earth. If one aligns with the energies of the four seasons, adapts their daily life accordingly to avoid the cold and heat, regulates diet, and does not indulge in excessive joy or anger to maintain mental clarity, desiring a balanced state throughout the seasons without preference for any, then one remains at peace. Otherwise, damage to the spleen and stomach can occur, with true qi sinking down or leaking out and failing to rise, which signifies there being autumn and winter without spring and summer. This leads to the potential for growth being hindered, caught in the destructive energies of decay, resulting in the emergence of various ailments, and even prolonged ascent without descent can also be a disease. The \"Spirit Chapter\" states: If the heart is anxious and over-thinks, it harms the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, fear ensues and one loses themselves. The \"Evil Qi Afflicting Organs\" chapter states: Worry and fear harm the heart. The \"Inquiry Chapter\" states: Sorrow and grief move the heart; when the heart moves, all five organs and six bowels also tremble. It is evident that the heart is the commander of the five organs and six bowels, overseeing the soul and spirit, encompassing desires and intentions. Thus, worry affects the lung, thought affects the spleen, anger affects the liver, and fear affects the kidneys; this is why the five emotions are governed by the heart. If one can nurture this heart well, and dwell in tranquility, without unnecessary fear or exuberance, harmoniously adapting to circumstances without contention, and changing with the times without a sense of self, then one's intentions are in harmony, the spirit is stable, anger does not arise, the soul does not scatter, and the five organs maintain tranquility; thus, evil cannot affect one."},{"anchor":"trans-85p","marker":"85p","type":"translation","text":"**On the Care of the Body** Laozi said: The reason I have great troubles is because I have a body. If I had no body, what troubles would I have? I would say: The reason I have great joys is because I have form; if I had no form, what joy would I have? It can be seen that what one possesses is merely the self, and what I rely on is merely the body. Without form, there would be no self; is this not the foremost duty of living? However, the significance of form is very subtle. As for movements, sights, and sounds, are they not all manifestations of this form? Beauty and ugliness, are they not reflections of this form? Courage and cowardice, wisdom and foolishness, are they not aspects of this form? Life and death, peace and distress, are they not related to this form? Human interactions are based on form; accomplishments are built upon form. The meaning of this form can be understood accordingly. Yet, people are unaware of how to nourish their bodies. If they do not injure their bodily forms through emotions and desires, they instead damage their bodily forms through labor and toil. When the inner form is harmed, the spirit and energy are depleted; when the outer form is hurt, the limbs become impaired. Even to the point where muscles wither away, the form becomes evident; once the form is defeated, the life can be understood. Thus, those who are good at preserving life must first nourish the body as the dwelling of the spirit. Those who are good at treating illnesses must first address the body as the foundation for recovery. Although there are many methods for caring for the body, ultimately, understanding the essence of vital energy and blood is sufficient to encompass it all."},{"anchor":"trans-86p","marker":"86p","type":"translation","text":"To dispel external邪, it cannot be achieved without 精血; to strengthen inner气, it cannot be accomplished without 精血.

Heaven gives birth to water, which is the ancestor of form. Therefore, anyone wishing to treat illness must prioritize the body; anyone wishing to treat the body must first focus on 精血. This is indeed the great path for doctors. If one can understand this, then transformation can be boundless and divine use can be unfathomable. However, utilizing this method does not exceed medicinal foods, and among these, the most relevant is only a few flavors. Other variations based on individual tendencies are but supplementary aids. Just as in food, who among edible things is without benefit? If one seeks purity and goodness, most suitable for the stomach's气, only grains can be seen. If one asks me what is appropriate, I find it hard to articulate.

Among the four points, there is a division of exterior and interior. In the mother's belly, the mother breathes and the child breathes; the mother inhales and the child inhales. It is like a navel connecting as flowers and fruits on branches. After one month and one week, the genuine energy gradually becomes sufficient. Upon birth, the placenta has not yet detached, and the umbilical cord is loosely severed. If the navel remains open, exposure to wind or cold may harm the infant's true energy. Thus, by fumigating with moxa several times, the true energy will be safeguarded. At three to seven days, the navel closes. Only then does it feel deep in the mouth. Therefore, as yang becomes exuberant and ages, it indulges in the five tastes, is drained by the five sounds, and is affected by the five qi, externally exhausting vital energy and internally suffering from cold, preventing the smooth flow of true energy.

After the breath stabilizes, one should close it again, starting with ten breaths, or twenty breaths, until it becomes unbearable. Gradually, with practice, one can increase this, but if one can hold it for over eighty breaths, then a pure flow of clear energy fills the organs and chest. When one has perfected this practice, at the time of holding the breath, there will be only a short breath remaining in the nose, with the held breath circulating like steam nourishing the lungs, making the body feel as if it is filled with a divine spirit. The experience is indescribably delightful. This is because the breath circulates freely within and without, reaching thoroughly up and down.

However, the essence can be summarized in this way. Practitioners who practice one or two times daily will gradually become fit and light, banishing all evils; they will run and gallop without fatigue. The \"Six Characters Breathing Formula\" from the Taishang Yuzhu: The Daoist canon contains the \"Yuzhu Sutra,\" which discusses the qi of the five organs and six bowels. Imbalances from the five flavors, combined with the six desires and seven feelings, can lead to illnesses over time, injuring the organs internally and attacking the nine orifices externally, resulting in diseases throughout the body. Mild cases may result in chronic ailments, severe cases in blindness or disability, and worst cases can lead to death. Therefore, Taishang shows compassion. This six-character breathing formula addresses the illnesses of the five organs and six bowels. The method involves exhaling to release toxic gases from the organs and inhaling to gather the pure qi of heaven and earth. There are small results in one day, significant results in ten days, and after a year, one will be free from all ailments."},{"anchor":"trans-194p","marker":"194p","type":"translation","text":"Extend life and enhance calculations, a treasure of health, not to be passed on to the unworthy. Breathing has six forms: he, hu, xi, xu, xi, and chui; these are all types of exhalation. Inhalation is just one type. The six forms serve to regulate the qi of the six organs: \"he\" regulates the heart qi, \"hu\" regulates the spleen qi, \"xi\" regulates the lung qi, \"xu\" regulates the liver qi, \"xi\" regulates the gallbladder qi, and \"chui\" regulates the kidney qi. These six terms correspond to the five organs and six bowels. The atmosphere of heaven and earth has its cycles: from the Rat to the Snake is the time of six Yang, and from the Horse to the Pig is the time of six Yin. During the Yang time, face east; do not completely close windows and doors, but be cautious of wind coming in. Then loosen your belt and sit erect. Knock your teeth thirty-six times to calm your spirit. First, swirl the turbid saliva in your mouth, rinsing it two or three hundred times, waiting until the mouth is like clear water, then lower your head to the left and swallow it, guiding it down with your mind. Wait until you feel it flow smoothly to your abdomen, then lower your head again, open your mouth, and first pronounce \"he\" to expel the toxic qi from your heart. While pronouncing, your ears must not hear the sound of \"he\"; if they do, the qi will become coarse and damage the heart qi.

By doing this for six times, the toxic energy of the heart gradually dissipates. Then, inhale the pure energy of heaven and earth to gradually restore the original energy of the heart. Next, follow this pattern to recite the word \"hū,\" ensuring that the ears do not hear the sound of exhaling; then inhale to replenish the spleen, again ensuring that the sound of inhalation is unheard.

With thirty-six and the six energies spread, the toxic gases in the organs gradually dissipate, the roots of illness gradually eliminated, and the gallbladder energy gradually completed. Observe which organ is affected; for eye ailments, recite \"xi\" and \"xu\" eighteen times each, inhaling to replenish during each session. In total, that makes thirty-six, which is called the middle cycle (Zhong Zhou). The middle cycle is the second set of thirty-six, totaling seventy-two. Then, again follow the previous method of \"he,\" \"hu,\" \"xi,\" \"xu,\" \"xi,\" and \"chui\" each for six times, with inhaling to replenish and exhaling to expel; this must be done earnestly without slackening, making this the third set of thirty-six, known as the great cycle (Da Zhou).

If this is done three times, it will total nine hundred times, leaving none unhealed. Keep it secret! Keep it secret! Do not pass it on to others.
