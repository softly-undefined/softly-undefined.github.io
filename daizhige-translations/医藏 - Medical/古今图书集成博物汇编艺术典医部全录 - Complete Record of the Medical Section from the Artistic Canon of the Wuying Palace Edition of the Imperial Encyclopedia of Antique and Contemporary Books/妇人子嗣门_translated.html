<p><strong>On Women and Offspring</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Classic of Pure Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Primordial Purity of Ancient Times</strong></p>
<p>When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, her heavenly essence (Tian Gui) arrives, the Ren (Conception) vessel opens, the Tai Chong (Penetrating) vessel is abundant, and her monthly cycle descends regularly, hence she is capable of bearing children. <strong>[Note: Tian Gui refers to the essence produced by Heavenly Yi, represented by the watery essence. Ren and Chong are extraordinary channels. Both vessels arise from within the lower abdomen, flowing upward, acting as the sea of menstrual blood, essential for women to nurture their wombs. The moon represents yin, and women also represent yin; the moon cycles monthly, waxing and waning, therefore women also menstruate monthly as a timely outflow. When there is depletion, it can renew, hence at the beginning of life, when male and female seeds unite, they are destined to conceive. If the essence is deficient, the capacity to conceive is easily affected.</strong>] At the age of twenty-one, if the Ren vessel is deficient, the Tai Chong vessel is weak, the heavenly essence is drained, and the pathways of earth (the body&#39;s channels) are blocked, then one&#39;s physique deteriorates, and they cannot bear children. <strong>[Note: The pathways of earth refer to the lower channels, associated with the foot&#39;s lesser yin. The drainage of Tian Gui indicates a blockage in the lower pathways. The deficiency of Ren and Chong results in the body weakening, leading to an inability to conceive.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Bone and Empty</strong></p>
<p>When the Governor Vessel is ill, a woman will be barren.<br>[Note: The Governor Vessel, along with the Penetrating and Conception Vessels, originates from between the uterus, hence affects a woman&#39;s fertility.]</p>
<p><strong>The Difficult Classic of Bian Que</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gate of Life Connects to the Uterus</strong></p>
<p>Each organ has one ear, but the kidneys uniquely possess two; however, not all are kidneys. The left one is the kidney, and the right one is the Gate of Life. The Gate of Life is where the essence of all spirits resides, and it is connected to the original qi. It is where men store their essence and women connect to their uterus.</p>
<p><strong>The Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br>[Written by Sun Simiao during the Tang Dynasty]</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Seeking Children</strong></p>
<p>The distinctions between men and women arise from differences in conception, pregnancy, and childbirth. Thus, a woman’s illnesses are ten times more difficult to treat compared to a man’s. The classics state that women are the gathering place of yin, constantly residing with dampness. After the age of fourteen, the yin energy overflows, causing myriad thoughts to disturb the heart, injuring the five organs internally and damaging one&#39;s appearance externally. The menstrual cycles fluctuate, alternating between arrival and departure, while stagnant blood congeals, blocking pathways and interrupting natural flow, leading to miscarriages that are difficult to discuss. The interplay of the five organs is complicated, with deficiency and excess intertwined, leading to the leaking of bad blood and depletion of qi. Sometimes due to excessive eating and drinking, injuries are compounded; at other times, existing wounds remain unresolved, leading to imbalances of yin and yang. Additionally, exposure to cold winds from improper sanitation can manifest as twelve chronic illnesses, which is why women require distinct treatments.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If the seasonal changes are considered a sickness, and the balance of yin and yang, heat and cold, affect the patient, then they are the same as men. However, a woman who is pregnant and suffering from illness should avoid toxic remedies. The various ailments shared with men are scattered throughout many texts and can be understood. Yet, women tend to have greater desires than men, and thus are more susceptible to illness, compounded by their deep emotions of love, hate, jealousy, and anxiety, which entrench their conditions, making healing difficult. Therefore, those who care for health must specifically teach daughters the three volumes of women&#39;s remedies, enabling them to understand thoroughly, so that in times of urgency, they need not be fearful.</p>
<p>The four virtues are fundamental for women’s lives; childbirth and nurturing are essential aspects of a woman’s existence. If one is not well-versed in these matters, how can one avoid premature death? Thus, the teachings of mothers cannot be neglected either. </p>
<p>It is advisable to copy a book for personal reference to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Human nature wishes to excel oneself while resenting others’ success; but when it comes to knowledge, people often follow their feelings, getting lost in affairs, and seldom dedicate themselves to pursuing the ultimate truths, thus wasting time meaninglessly throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Marriage and parenting are the foundation of human relationships and the basis of governance. The wise set forth teachings, articulating their intentions, yet future generations may not grasp them thoroughly. When faced with real situations, they may appear confused and foolish; this is a wrongful desire to excel personally without understanding others. Such individuals truly miss the essence of self-improvement and instead pursue empty fame, resulting in futility.</p>
<p>Now I present the methods of seeking offspring, which may benefit future generations; like-minded individuals may find this useful.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>To seek an offspring, one must first understand the spouses&#39; destinies, the interactions of the five elements, and their moral alignment. If their destinies are not positioned in the grave of barrenness or death, then one can certainly conceive. However, if their destinies present conflicts among the five elements, or encounter violent disruptions, and are situated in the grave of barrenness or death, then conception becomes impossible; be very cautious not to act hastily! Even if a child is conceived, it will ultimately bring trouble later on. Yet, if their elements are harmonious and they encounter blessings and virtue, they must still adhere to the proper methods and avoid all taboos. The offspring born will be excellent and outstanding, difficult to fully describe.</p>
<p>For those without children, it is often due to both spouses suffering from the five labors and seven injuries, leading to various ailments, hence the risk of lacking heirs. The remedy for this is for the man to take the &quot;Seven Sons Powder&quot; and for the woman to take &quot;Purple Stone Asparagus Pills,&quot; along with the herbal concoction for cleansing the womb; all will yield children. In ancient times, those seeking offspring frequently used &quot;Celebratory Cloud Powder&quot; and &quot;Accommodating Blessing Pills,&quot; but in modern times, these are seldom used. Although they haven&#39;t been tested recently, their principles are significant, thus I have described them.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Seed Method</strong></p>
<p>When inciting fire, one must stop at the time of the winter solstice; otherwise, it will exceed the womb. For if it is too deep, it leads to the realm of less yin, a harsh and destructive direction, how can there be growth and transformation? If it is too shallow, it aligns with the realm of less yang, a harmonious way, thus it can produce life. Therefore, the place of conception is shallow, not deep. It is also forbidden to engage in matters right after menstruation. Only on the first day after menstruation can it be male, on the second day female, on the third day male; beyond these, no successful conception will occur. Great winds and heavy rains, extreme cold and heat, eclipses of the sun and moon, all these times should not be engaged in, as any offspring will be foolish, deaf, and physically incomplete.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Chen Ziming)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seeking Sons</strong>  </p>
<p>The wife of Prince Xiaowang of Jianping, Ji, was beautiful but bore no children. A selection was made for young unmarried girls from common families to enter the palace, yet still, there were no children. The question arose: Is there a way to seek sons? Cheng replied: A union of man and woman must take place at the right age. Although a boy may understand matters at sixteen, he should marry at thirty; though a girl may receive her first menstruation at fourteen, she should marry at twenty. The union must ensure that yin and yang are fully developed before conception can occur, leading to pregnancy and raising a strong, healthy, and long-lived child. If a girl is not yet of age, and her first menstruation is approaching, she is too close to male attraction; if her yin energy is depleted prematurely, it may cause injury before maturity, leading to unsuccessful conception and weak offspring. This is why the prince has no children. However, if a woman produces only daughters or only sons, if the King can indeed seek many women who produce sons to the palace, there is a method for obtaining sons. The King replied: Good. Before long, six sons were born. Old yang meets young yin, old yin meets young yang; this is also a method for having children. </p>
<p>Where there is a husband and wife, there is a father and son. After marital union, the search for heirs is essential, thus the ancients said there are three forms of unfilial conduct, of which having no heirs is the most significant, emphasizing the weight of continuing the lineage. All who desire children should first examine whether there are any burdensome illnesses or injuries affecting the couple, and by following prescribed remedies and treatments, peace between inner and outer conditions can be achieved, leading to the birth of children.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Notes: According to Master Danxi, the process of conception in humans is initiated by the application of yang essence, which the yin blood can subsequently nourish. The essence contributes to the formation of the child, while the blood contributes to the development of the womb, leading to successful pregnancy. If a woman does not conceive, it is usually due to insufficient blood to capture the essence. The deficiency of blood can arise from multiple reasons. However, those who wish to conceive must replenish their essence and blood to avoid deficiency, as this is essential for successful pregnancy. I humbly suggest that a woman&#39;s infertility can also result from the harm caused by the disturbances of the six emotions and seven feelings affecting the conception and reception mechanisms, lingering illnesses that have affected the internal organs, a cold and weak uterus, excessive qi with declining blood, or hidden heat within the blood; additionally, a deficiency in the spleen and stomach can hinder the nourishment of the reproductive organs. It is also crucial to assess the man&#39;s physical condition, whether he has kidney deficiency and weak essence that prevents conception, or if he has inherently poor vitality and depleted qi and blood, or if he indulges excessively and his yin essence is exhausted. Each individual should identify the root cause and address it accordingly. In general, one should examine the pulse of both males and females; if the right wrist pulse is thin or weak, one should use the Bawei Pill; if the left wrist pulse is strong and lacks strength upon palpation, the Liuwai Pill should be used; if both wrist pulses are either thin or excessively strong, the Shibu Pill is recommended. Additionally, as the Chao clan mentions, if the couple’s ages are incompatible or if there are adverse influences from graves, it may be a factor. If one mistakenly uses warming and drying herbs, it will not only be ineffective but may also cause harm.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p>
<h3>On Childlessness</h3>
<p>The reasons for childlessness can be categorized into three: First, unfavorable conditions of the grave and feng shui; second, conflict in the life spans of the couple; third, illness of the couple. Unfavorable graves and conflicting life spans cannot be remedied with medicine. However, if the couple is ill, medication is necessary. A woman may be childless due to labor damaging her qi and blood, menstrual complications, or issues like excessive bleeding or discharge. If the pulse at the right wrist is floating, it indicates male infertility, whereas a weak pulse at the wrist or at both positions indicates sterility. Mismanagement of lifestyle, irregular diet, exposure to wind and cold, all can lead to infertility as well.</p>
<h3>Prohibitions on Conception</h3>
<p>When seeking to conceive, it is advisable to choose auspicious days and avoid conflicts associated with the fire element, particularly during full moons and new moons, as well as during severe weather such as storms, thunder, or extreme temperatures. It is also important to avoid days when the sun and moon are obscured, when earthquakes occur, or when there are signs of abnormal phenomena concerning celestial bodies, altars, wells, kitchens, latrines, or graves. If conception occurs during these inauspicious times, it can lead to many problems: children may be born disabled, untimely, or foolish and unfilial. However, if intercourse is timed correctly, it can result in children blessed with virtue and wisdom. This is a matter of significant impact, thus one should not be careless!<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Method for Determining Conception of Male and Female</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to conception, if a woman has her menstrual cycle cease for one, three, or five days, it is male. If conception occurs two, four, or six days after her cycle ceases, it is female. Any conception after six days will not be successful. Additionally, if it coincides with auspicious days, it is especially favorable. If a child is born at midnight, it is said to be wise, noble, and long-lived, while times other than this tend to be unfavorable.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Determining Auspicious Days by Branches and Stems</strong></p>
<p>In spring: Jia and Yi; in summer: Bing and Ding; in autumn: Geng and Xin; in winter: Ren and Gui. In spring: Yin and Mao; in summer: Si and Wu; in autumn: Shen and You; in winter: Hai and Zi.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Determining Monthly Auspicious Days</strong></p>
<p>For January: 1st, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 21st, 24th, 29th. For February: 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 19th, 22nd, 27th. For March: 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 17th, 20th, 25th. For April: 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 15th, 18th, 22nd, 28th. For May: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th, 22nd, 25th. (The original text states &quot;15th,&quot; which is adjusted based on context.)<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>28th, 29th, 30th day of the sixth month; 1st, 3rd, 10th, 13th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th day of the seventh month; 1st, 11th, 16th, 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 29th day of the eighth month; 3rd, 6th, 11th, 16th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 24th day of the ninth month; 1st, 4th, 9th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 22nd, 29th day of the tenth month; 1st, 6th, 11th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 19th, 26th, 29th day of the eleventh month; 4th, 9th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 24th, 27th day of the twelfth month. In spring, it combines with Jia Yin and Yi Mao; in summer, it combines with Bing Wu and Ding Si; in autumn, it combines with Geng Shen and Xin You; in winter, it combines with Ren Zi and Gui Hai. The conjunctions with the above-mentioned monthly stars and dates are favorable.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The Theory of Form Reception</p>
<p>Chao&#39;s discussion states: Yang induces Yin transformation, and when精气 (vital energy) is abundant, two embryos can be both male and female. The Daoist texts say: If a woman has intercourse on the first, third, or fifth day after her monthly cycle, and it coincides with auspicious days for boys and girls, it is likely to result in a male child. If both parents are robust, it leads to many children; if one is weak, it results in fewer children. The Lu Nao text states: When Yang is abundant, Yin will develop into a male, and all six meridians will elevate Yin. It also states: When three Yang energies converge, a male is born; when three Yin energies converge, a female is born. Ge Xianweng&#39;s &quot;Zhou Hou Fang&quot; claims: Males derive from paternal energy, while females derive from maternal energy. The Sheng Ji text states: The virtue of heaven and the energy of earth combine Yin and Yang harmoniously, flowing in one entity. If the energy moves left, it is associated with Yang, resulting in a male; if it moves right, it is associated with Yin, resulting in a female. The I Ching asserts that the Qi of the Sky produces males, while the Qi of the Earth produces females; this marks the distinction between the two genders.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Whenever there is illness during pregnancy, administering herbal decoctions typically weakens it by more than half, allowing the disease to leave the mother in peace without harming the fetus. </p>
<p>[Note: According to Dongyuan and Danxi, after the cessation of menstrual flow, one or two days later, the blood sea begins to clear, and if the male essence prevails over the blood, a boy is conceived; if four or five days later the blood vessels are vigorous, and the essence does not prevail over the blood, a girl is conceived. It is understood that the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood meet because of this interaction. When the essence acts, the blood can nourish the essence, resulting in a child, which begins with the male principle. Conversely, when the blood flows and the essence cannot overtake it, a girl is born, originating from the female principle. The interaction of yin and yang leads to the formation of the embryo, which is housed in the uterus, a singular structure below, branching into two, one leading left and the other right. If the essence surpasses the blood, the yang rules and the energy from the left uterus produces a boy; if the essence does not prevail, the yin rules and the energy from the right uterus produces a girl. This is the definitive theory of the two origins.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Receiving Form</strong></p>
<p>The Zhu family states: The union of male and female involves the interaction of their essences. The yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence; the blood envelops the essence, which then enters to form bones, resulting in the creation of a male. Conversely, if the yang essence enters first, with the yin blood following, the essence envelops the blood, which then forms the foundation, resulting in the creation of a female. </p>
<p>Yang energy gathers at the face, which is why males have heavier features, and those who die by drowning must be face down. Yin energy gathers at the back, hence females have heavier backs, and those who die by drowning must be face up. This applies to both beasts and humans regardless of position in death. </p>
<p>When yin and yang equally arrive, there is neither male nor female body; the essence and blood disperse equally, showing signs of multiple pregnancies. If the father is young and the mother old, the daughter will likely be weak; if the mother is strong and the father weak, the son will likely be frail. </p>
<p>Ancient skilled craftspeople first observed this. When energy is unevenly exhausted, they compensate accordingly. To nourish a weak daughter, they should strengthen her blood and spleen; to bolster a frail son, they should fortify his spleen and regulate his complexion. Weak daughters ought to marry in a timely manner, while frail sons should wait until they are strong to marry. This constitutes the foundation of issues arising from external circumstances and must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>On the Production of Treasures</strong></p>
<p>Generally, when treating illnesses, one first considers what is central to the issue: for men, it involves regulating Qi, and for women, it involves regulating blood. Qi and blood are the essence of a person. In women, blood is fundamental; if they can diligently take care of it, then Qi and blood circulate smoothly, and their spirit becomes clear. Monthly cycles occur as expected, and blood coagulates to form pregnancy. However, if the spleen and stomach are weak, they cannot properly digest food; if the nourishment and protective energies are insufficient, menstruation will not occur. This may lead to pale skin, a lack of luster in the face, abdominal pain from cold or heat, and difficulties in childbearing. In some cases, there may be excessive vaginal discharge or bleeding, leading to conditions like masses. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: If a woman has long-standing weakness of the spleen and stomach, causing both Qi and blood to decline, leading to irregular menstruation, it is advisable to tonify the spleen&#39;s Qi and nourish the source of transformation. Alternatively, if there is middle burner heat causing a lack of fluids, resulting in the drying up of the blood sea, one should clear the stomach and tonify the spleen, allowing the cycle to resume. The classic says: the stomach is the source of protection, and the spleen is the basis of nourishment. The &quot;Acupuncture Canon&quot; states that nourishment emerges from the middle burner and protection from the upper burner. If protective energy is insufficient, it must be supplemented with pungents; if nourishment is deficient, it must be replenished with sweetness. The combination of sweet and pungent harmonizes the spleen and stomach, enhancing nourishment and protection, thereby invigorating both Qi and blood. If one suffers from excessive mental strain leading to vacuous fire acting erratically, causing irregular menstruation, it is advisable to calm the mind, replenish blood, and drain excess fire—this is the treatment method of Master Dong Yuan.]</strong><a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>On the Discussions of Childlessness</strong></p>
<p>A woman&#39;s Qi is weak due to her blood, which is why she cannot have children; it is advisable to suppress her Qi and disperse it. Indeed, Xiangfuzi is the miraculous medicine for women, and it should not be said to deplete true Qi to avoid taking it. If a woman&#39;s blood is weak, the generative organs may become cold and stagnant, leading to fewer children; thus, the use of amethyst is recommended. </p>
<p>The &quot;Internal Canon&quot; states that all diseases arise from Qi. There are seven types of Qi, and there are nine types of Qi when combined with the two conditions of cold and heat. Joy, anger, worry, thought, sadness, fear, and shock are the seven types; beyond these seven emotions, when you add the conditions of cold and heat, it forms the nine types of Qi. </p>
<p>Both men and women can suffer from Qi-related ailments. However, for women, issues related to blood and Qi are especially severe. Blood in the body moves with Qi; when Qi becomes blocked, blood and Qi become stagnant, which can lead to irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, premenstrual pain, continuous bleeding after menstruation, or pain that radiates to the waist and back. This can result in nausea and loss of appetite, and in severe cases, it can cause convulsions in the hands and feet. The symptoms resemble those of epilepsy, and they can manifest as cold and heat disturbances or lumps. The body may become emaciated; not only is conception difficult, but if left untreated for long, it can lead to severe illness.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>In &quot;The Origin of Diseases by the Chao Clan,&quot; it is discussed that women have thirty-six ailments. The thirty-six ailments include seven symptoms, eight masses, nine pains, and twelve types of leucorrhea. However, the so-called twelve types of leucorrhea do not specify their symptoms in detail, and what people suffer from today is mainly just two types of leucorrhea. The cause of these ailments, when traced, is overexertion leading to exhaustion, deficiencies in the Chong and Ren meridians, and exposure to wind and cold affecting the uterus. </p>
<p>Moreover, during normal times, women should have adequate blood and less qi, which contributes to health and prevents diseases. If qi becomes excessive compared to blood, it may generate cold, causing blood to fail to transform into red, resulting in white discharge; if qi is balanced but blood is insufficient, insufficient blood generates heat, causing blood to fail to transform into red, resulting in red discharge; when cold and heat coexist, both red and white discharges occur along with symptoms. </p>
<p>For virgins who, after marriage, suffer from deficiencies leading to this ailment, it can prevent them from conceiving, leading to the end of their lineage. Anyone with these symptoms should seek treatment promptly, as neglecting it can lead to dark complexion, emaciation, abdominal distension, sharp pains, and severe coldness in the limbs, ultimately affecting appetite. </p>

<p>(Infertility in women)<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>For women aged around twenty to thirty years, even without illness but lacking offspring, if their menstrual blood is normal or irregular, it is due to a failure of yin to rise and yang to descend. One can use Dusheng San to expel cold phlegm in quantities of two to three sheng; afterward, use Daoshui Wan and Yugong San to promote diuresis, expelling three to five measures or over ten measures. Alternatively, use Wuyou San to expel over ten measures; following this, consume onion vinegar white porridge for three to five days. Once the stomach Qi is unblocked and the intestines are filled, one can take Yuzhu San, supplemented with Guiling Baizhu Wan; this is the method to lower heart fire and enhance kidney water, ensuring pregnancy within a few months. However, if a woman has symptoms such as urinary retention, leaks, or throat dryness, even with medication or acupuncture, she will still have difficulty conceiving. This is due to the issues with the Chong, Ren, and Du meridians, which are therefore not treated.</p>
<p>If a woman is robust and abundant, endowed with ample resources and indulging excessively in food and drink, and her menstrual flow is irregular, resulting in failure to conceive, it is termed excessive bodily fat, obstructing the uterus. In such cases, one should use damp-dry phlegm treatments involving Xing, Xia, Cangzhu, Chuanxiong, Fangfeng, Qianghuo, and Huashi, or similar expectorant decoctions. If the person is thin and timid, with an impatient temperament and irregular menstrual flow, hence unable to conceive, it is referred to as a dry and bloodless uterus with insufficient capacity to receive the essence of conception. In this case, it is advisable to cool the blood and kindle the fire, or to use Siwu Decoction with Xiangfu, Huangqin, and Chaihu to nourish the blood and yin. Dongyuan has the Liuwuwei Dihuang Wan to replenish the yin and blood of women who lack offspring; those who take it can achieve conception.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Inappropriateness of Using Qin Gui Pill for Infertility</strong></p>
<p>The causes of infertility largely stem from women. Physicians do not seek to understand the source of the issue; instead, they indiscriminately review ancient remedies. The Qin Gui Pill is notably mentioned, as it is seen as a definitive treatment. Its principle is to use warm and hot medicines that are close to human nature, which people willingly take, boldly consume, and suffer the burning consequences without realizing their recklessness. Why is this? The essence of yang must be applied, and the blood of yin must be able to capture it; the essence creates the child, and the blood forms the embryo, allowing conception to come about. </p>
<p>Currently, women who are infertile usually have insufficient blood to capture the essence. The deficiency of blood is not due to a single cause. However, those desiring children must nourish the yin blood, ensuring there are no deficiencies, so that they may draw on any surplus to nurture pregnancy. Yet, they lightly resort to hot agents, boiling their organs, causing the blood and qi to bubble and boil, leading to immediate disaster. </p>
<p>Some say: &quot;In spring, the warmth nurtures all life, and in winter, the cold causes all to wither.&quot; If not for the warmth of the Qin Gui Pill, how could one expect the organs to warm up and lead to pregnancy? I reply: Poetry says that if women are harmonious and peaceful, they will joyously have children. Harmony means the blood and qi are not at odds; peace ensures yin and yang do not contend. </p>
<p>Using this medicine, the menstrual blood must certainly turn purple and black, gradually decreasing in quantity, whether quickly or slowly. Initially, the appetite may surge, but over time, the mouth becomes bitter and dry, yin and yang become unbalanced, and the blood and qi do not harmonize. Illnesses arise in swarms; how can one expect to conceive? Even if conception occurs, the children are often frail and not long-lived, as the Qin Gui Pill damages the natural essence of yin. One must be cautious and wary.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>Theory of Conception</h3>
<p>The theory regarding the differentiation of male and female after conception from the essence and blood, as presented by Chu Cheng, confounds me. Later, I reviewed the writings of Li Dongyuan, which state: if the menstrual flow ceases for one or two days, and the blood pool begins to clear, then if the essence prevails over the blood, a male is conceived; if four or five days later, the blood vessels are robust and the essence cannot surpass the blood, a female is conceived. This is indeed a sound theory. The Book of Changes states: the dry principle produces males, while the receptive principle produces females. The concepts of &#39;dry&#39; and &#39;receptive&#39; reflect the nature of yin and yang; the left and right represent the paths of yin and yang; and male and female symbolize the forms of yin and yang. The paternal essence and maternal blood meet through interaction. The essence initiates creation, while the blood nurtures. The essence produces the child, and thus all things begin with the dry origin; the blood forms the womb, and all things arise from the receptive origin. When yin and yang unite, conception occurs, and the place where this occurs is called the uterus. It has a connection below, with two branches above, one leading to the left and one to the right.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>When the essence prevails over the blood, the Yang is the master, receiving qi from the left ovary, resulting in the formation of a male; when the essence does not prevail against the blood, the Yin is the master, receiving qi from the right ovary, resulting in the formation of a female. It is said that the division of male and female is understood. A male cannot be a father, a female cannot be a mother; how then should we differentiate those who possess both male and female traits? I say: a male cannot be a father if he suffers from a deficiency of Yang energy. A female cannot be a mother if she suffers from an obstruction of Yin energy. Those with both traits are formed when Yin is influenced by the mixed qi, thus varying in essence. There are two kinds of females with male traits: one meets a man as a wife and a woman as a husband; the other can be a wife but cannot be a husband. Those females who possess the entirety of male traits represent a more pronounced mixture. It is questioned whether the mixed qi only appears in the Yin, and whether the forms influenced vary similarly. I reply: the Yin body is weak, thus the mixed qi is easy to influence. When affected by mixed qi, Yin and Yang intermingle without a clear master, belonging neither to the left nor the right, receiving qi from the space between the two paths, and forming based on the weight of the mixed qi. Therefore, the forms that combine male and female traits cannot be uniformly categorized. </p>

<p>Women are primarily defined by blood.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>A woman may live her life without having a broken belly, yet why is she still barren? Typically, women are governed by blood; if the blood is deficient and the qi is strong, it will result in infertility. It is precisely because of blood deficiency that they are unable to conceive.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Remedies</strong></p>
<p>The Chóngsī pill, when adjusted properly, allows for intercourse seven days after consumption and should be avoided once pregnancy occurs. The Warm Umbilical Seed formula is especially suitable for women. When feeling warmth in the umbilical area, one should stop, and if needed, wait a few days before applying moxibustion again; excessive treatment can generate heat. The Warm Umbilical Belly formula is suitable for women whose meridians are not balanced and who have not conceived for a long time. It should be avoided by those who are pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seeking Children</strong></p>
<p>Hu Xu said: In the intercourse of men and women, the formation of a fetus, although it stems from the essence and blood, also consists of postnatal impurities. A spark of pre-natal true essence arises from the feelings of desire, which harmonizes with it. This is what Zhu Xi referred to in discussing the initial stages of life and what the &quot;True Understanding&quot; text referred to as the beginning of corporeal life receiving qi. The skilled doctor, when faced with infertility, will address the man regarding essence and the woman regarding blood. Thus, remedies are formulated, emphasizing kidney supplementation for men and menstrual regulation for women, supplemented further by qi tonification and movement. By examining the pulse and understanding the imbalances, treatment can be tailored, leading to successful conception, ensuring that every man can become a father and every woman a mother.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p>
<h3>Summary of the Chronicle of Guanci (Ming Dynasty, Wanquan)</h3>
<h4>Chapter on Moderation of Desires</h4>
<p>Men flourish in vitality when they seek a spouse, while women thrive in blood when they conceive. The matching of men and women is fundamental for procreation, continuing the patterns of behavior and social norms, and its significance is not trivial. The methods for seeking offspring should be approached seriously. For men, vitality is key, while for women, blood is essential. When male essence flows freely and is abundant, and female blood descends regularly without disruption, the harmonious interaction of yin and yang allows for the blending of essence and blood, resulting in the formation of embryos and the nourishment of life. Otherwise, if the masculine energy weakens, it cannot fulfill its requirements for the feminine energy; if the feminine energy diminishes, it cannot align with the masculine, leading to discord between yin and yang, and a separation of essence and blood, thus resulting in infertility. Those who do not comprehend this often violate the principles of nature, erroneously devising methods to seek progeny, while relying on the cycle of the five elements for nurturing and supplementing through medicines and foods, attempting to falsify reality and defy nature. Even if one manages to achieve conception, many face difficulties in nurturing or carrying to term. </p>
<p>In ancient times, men married after thirty and women after twenty, as noted in the writings of the Chu family, for fear of harming their essence and blood. Hence, in the pursuit of offspring, men should cultivate a clear mind and moderate desires to nurture their essence; women should maintain a calm and stable heart to cultivate their blood.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The essence of a man must be abundant for his spirit to be lively; when his will is joyful, his spirit must be unrestrained. If one does not know how to regulate this, the spirit easily becomes scattered. If one does not understand how to maintain form, abundance easily turns to deficiency. Thus, his essence is often insufficient, unable to overflow or spill forth. This is why men value a tranquil heart and few desires, nurturing their essence.</p>
<p>The nature of women is narrow and quick to anger; their emotions are charming and easily stirred. Being quick to anger leads to much resentment and reverses their energy; being easily stirred leads to excessive interactions and depletion. When energy is reversed, blood is insufficient and cannot nourish, resulting in irregular menstrual cycles. Therefore, women value a calm heart and stable intentions, nurturing their blood.</p>
<p>Men&#39;s essence and women&#39;s blood are hard to maintain and easy to lose. When the easily lost essence is accompanied by insatiable desires, it fails again and again, thus men do not reach maturity by age sixteen, and women do not by age fourteen, leading to early decline. I have observed men near women—spending one night together multiple times; initially, there is essence, then clear fluid, and afterward, blood, leading to severe depletion.</p>
<p>The blood of women is said to diminish in seven ways: it transforms into breast milk above and menstrual blood below. The waters of intercourse seep and mix with the muddled, leaking substances from within, all are the blood of the body. Adding to this the frequency of childbirth, can it not lead to continual decline? Hence, in the quest for children, men must enrich their essence, and women must enrich their blood, regulated by propriety and properly timed, without excess.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Selection of Partners</strong></p>
<p>Bones and flesh are bright and luminous, the spirit is pure and substantial, and there are flowers worth using. There are five types that are unsuitable: First, the shell type, where the female’s external genitalia resembles a snail shell, winding inward; second, the type with markings, where the female’s genitalia is as small as the tip of a chopstick, only allowing passage but difficult for union, known as the stone woman; third, the drum flower type, which is tight and seems to have no opening; fourth, the horn flower type, which is sharp and pointed; fifth, the vein type, where the meridians have not reached fourteen but appear first, or arrive at fifteen or sixteen, or are unbalanced, or entirely absent. These five types without flowers cannot unite with the sun, how could they possibly form an immortal fetus?</p>
<p><strong>Union</strong></p>
<p>Male essence and female blood combine to form a fetus. The child&#39;s shape resembles that of the parents, as it has a definite origin. Therefore, those seeking children should have men enhance their essence and regulate their desires, ensuring the Yang path remains strong; women should nourish their blood and balance their energy, allowing for the timely arrival of menstruation, cultivating one another in the process—this is the way to have children. </p>
<p>For weak men and frail women, the methods of nurturing are what those seeking children must discuss. For a strong man and robust woman, with abundant essence and blood, children will naturally arise, so no supplementation is needed. However, for men who are weak and constantly lack essence, they should strengthen their kidneys to enhance their essence; for frail women, who frequently lack blood, they should strengthen their spleen to nourish their blood. To strengthen the kidneys, one can use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Decoction, with the addition of Schisandra and processed Aconite for cold essence. To strengthen the spleen, one can use the Ginseng, Poria, and Atractylodes Powder, adding Angelica and Chuanxiong if blood is deficient.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>A proverb says: When a man’s essence is abundant and the woman’s blood flows regularly, the yang transforms and combines with the yin, nurturing and solidifying the fetus wonderfully. A male strengthens his essence, a female regulates her cycle, only then can they conceive, and the cicadas will buzz. If a man loses his yang or a woman loses her yin, even if they mate, they will not conceive; even if they do conceive, it will not hold. The methods of adjustment and nourishment are clear to the skilled; if they do not encounter the right conditions, it may bring disaster instead. </p>
<p>For women who are substantial and yet have no children, it is advisable to take the Cang Fu Dao Phlegm Pill. For women without children, or those with irregular menstruation, there are methods to regulate the cycle. Those with insufficient blood should take the Liu Wei Di Huang Pill. Those with pre-existing diseases should take the Bu Pi Shen Ling Bai Zhu Powder. As for those with deficient cold in the uterus, it is crucial to emphasize this: if one insists on avoiding the prohibition of heating medicines, it is akin to being one-sided. </p>
<p>Now, I recommend the formulas from Han Feixia’s Golden Elixir and Yang Renzhai’s Ai Fu Warm Official Pill for treating those with deficiency and cold.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Xieqi Poem</strong></p>
<p>The Seed Song says: “At thirty, two and a half days have passed; on the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, one must calculate. Fallen petals cover the ground, marking an auspicious time; the golden water has stirred, causing disorder. In times of chaos, efforts are wasted; one seeks remnants of red among the trees, both high and low. If one understands the blooming of flowers, there’s no worry that the red osmanthus won’t cluster together.” </p>
<p>This means when a woman’s menstruation has just ended, and the golden water has just begun; at this moment, the uterus opens, indicating the time for conception. It coincides perfectly with the time of harmony. After this auspicious period, the uterus closes and cannot conceive. However, there are unique secrets for men and women. For example, if conception occurs right after menstruation—on the first, third, or fifth day, it results in a boy; on the second, fourth, or sixth day, it results in a girl. Beyond this, there will be no pregnancy.</p>
<p>The conclusion states: “What is the method for seed? Within the classics, it inquires about the reasons. Yesterday, red flowers fell; today it corresponds to the surrounding. In Lantian, white jade is planted; between noon and midnight, threads of silk weave together. Three and five days yield the red osmanthus; two and four days bring forth white plums.” </p>
<p>This refers to the time before water in the ancient scriptures; the sea of blood is full, and the uterus has not opened, so it cannot conceive. Once the menstruation has occurred, the uterus opens and the sea of blood is cleared, enabling it to accept the essence. “Yesterday” refers to two and a half days later. “Between noon and midnight” indicates the beginning of the interplay of yin and yang, aligning with the hexagram Jiou, not merely the two times.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>After the period has ended one day, three days, or five days, if an odd number is obtained, a boy will definitely be born; thus it is said that the red osmanthus blossoms. If an even number is obtained on the second, fourth, or sixth day, a girl will definitely be born; thus it is said that the white plum blossoms. After seven days, the uterus closes again, and pregnancy cannot occur.</p>
<p>The secret says: The jade lake must be shallow, heavy burdens only bring worries. Yin blood gathers first, while yang essence flows later. When blood opens, it wraps the jade dew, and one steps lightly to Penglai. The shallow approach refers to the method of &quot;nine shallow and one deep&quot; as mentioned in &quot;The Book of the Plain Girl.&quot; Thus, in the union of man and woman, if shallow, the girl is beautiful; if deep, the girl is harmed, hence &quot;heavy burdens only bring worries.&quot; If yin blood gathers first and yang essence flows later, blood opens to wrap essence and a boy is produced; if yang essence arrives first and yin blood gathers later, essence opens to wrap blood and a girl is produced. This corresponds to the assertion in the &quot;Book of Changes&quot; that yin wraps yang to add beauty to the osmanthus garden, and yang wraps yin for the peach grotto to gain immortality.</p>
<p>The secret says: From this union, we temporarily part, the cowherd and the weaver girl cross the river to play. In the second month, flowers bloom, one knows the joy has arrived. Good news should be shared, while malicious words must not be carelessly spread. This refers to after the seed is planted, the man should sleep apart, avoiding further intercourse, as the essence and blood are just beginning to coagulate, fearing another impact. Therefore, in ancient times, when a woman became pregnant, she would live in a side chamber to nurture her fetal energy. The second month refers to the following month.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The previous month, when menstruation began, was the time for planting the precious seeds. The next month, when menstruation stopped, signified true conception. At this time, the methods of prenatal education must not be neglected; hence, one should often listen to beautiful words, witness good deeds, hear poetry and literature, and practice archery. It is imperative to avoid lascivious sounds and immoral sights.</p>
<p>The admonition states: When menstruation first arrives, it is called &quot;red lead,&quot; and it lasts for thirty days. The auspicious time is not to be missed. The old impurities have been expelled, and the new beginnings have not yet emerged. The uterus has properly opened, and the precious seeds are sown in fertile fields. The male principle is strong; do not let the process be burdensome. Do not let the energy become discordant; ensure that the emotions are joyful. When the male and female principles unite in harmony, may the rain be timely and the winds be gentle. The fragrant flowers bear fruits, and the red osmanthus flourishes.</p>
<p>The seeds must receive the blessings of Heaven and Moon, harmonizing the Triple Harmony and the Six Harmonies for a favorable continuation into the future; the days are auspicious. In the first month, Ding, Ren, Bing, and Xin bring about initiation and closure. In the second month, Shen, Si, Jia, and Ji establish stability and resolve dangers. In the third month, Ding and Ren conduct initiation and closure. In the fourth month, Xin, Bing, Geng, and Yi lead to fullness and opening. In the fifth month, Hai, Yin, Bing, and Xin result in initiation, continuation, and removal. In the sixth month, Jia and Ji bring about removal, fullness, and opening. In the seventh month, Gui, Wu, Ding, and Ren culminate in resolution and closure. In the eighth month, Yin and Hai ensure resolution and removal. In the ninth month, Bing and Xin deal with initiation, overcoming dangers, and achieving completion. In the tenth month, Yi, Geng, Jia, and Ji establish peace and closure. In the eleventh month, Si, Shen, Ding, and Ren lead to removal, initiation, and overcoming completion.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>In the twelfth month of the Gengyin year, the construction is completed and the gates are opened. [The outer construction opening aligns with the heavenly joy, and it will surely benefit future generations within.] The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: Heaven and Earth unite, and all things transform into essence; men and women merge their vital energies, and all things give birth. Truly, this is an accurate statement. When men and women are both pleased, the interaction of yin and yang brings about the formation of the embryo. Consider the praise in the &quot;Songs of Zhou&quot;: When a man cherishes his wife and has the support of his companions, the affection between husband and wife, even in the fields, is never forgotten. Thus, between the mat and pillow, though their bodies may not yet intermingle, their spirits have already connected; the male essence is imparted, and the female receives, leading to conception. However, if the husband delights in his wife yet she is not satisfied, their bodies may touch, the essence may be initially released, but if the female does not receive, conception will not occur. If the wife follows her husband but his will differs, then it is like waves of peaches crashing but the frost of jade has no drop; thus, the female blood may open but there is no entry from the male. When yin and yang are at odds, the conjunction of heaven and earth cannot occur; how then can all things be transformed and birthed? The method for seeking a child requires careful observation: After a woman’s menstrual flow has completed and during the four auspicious days, when her womb is opened, intercourse can occur to conceive a child. During spring on the days of Jia and Yi in the months of Yin and Mao, in summer on the days of Bing and Ding in the months of Si and Wu, in autumn on the days of Geng and Xin in the months of Shen and You, and in winter on the days of Ren and Gui in the months of Hai and Zi, as well as on the days of Wu and Ji in the months of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. If these days are not suitable, one should choose auspicious times to carry it out.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The &quot;Fan Sheng Jing&quot; states: At the time of union, a woman has five signs of injury: First, if her vagina is still closed and cannot open, forcing penetration could harm the lungs. Second, if the woman desires the man but he does not respond, and if desire surpasses the initial union, it could harm the heart and disrupt the menstrual cycle. Third, if a young yin encounters an old yang, the phallus may not be firm, and if it enters but cannot move, it could harm the woman&#39;s eyes, potentially leading to blindness. Fourth, if the woman&#39;s menstrual flow has not fully ended and the man forces the union, it could injure her kidneys. Fifth, if a man is heavily intoxicated and engages with a woman, though he is firm and continues for a long time, if the woman has already passed her desire, excessive stimulation could harm her abdomen. These five signs of injury must be taken seriously by those desiring children at the time of union.</p>
<p>Before men and women unite, there are three conditions for men and five for women. When their feelings are stirred and they connect spiritually before engaging, the yin and yang harmonize, and their essence and blood coalesce, leading to the possibility of conception. However, if the man&#39;s feelings have reached their peak while the woman&#39;s have not, it results in premature ejaculation, referred to as solitary yang. Conversely, if the woman&#39;s feelings are stirred but the man&#39;s are not, and she has already passed her peak desire, it is called deficient yin. The &quot;Yu Han Jing&quot; says that solitary yang and deficient yin do not lead to conception, as in the case of a widower and a widow, who are unable to conceive.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>There are also three signs: the first is when the yang essence is vigorous and vibrant, which indicates the arrival of liver energy; the second is when it is robust and warm, indicating the arrival of heart energy; the third is when it is firm and enduring, indicating the arrival of kidney energy. When all three are present, it brings pleasure to a woman’s heart. If one is weak and cannot perform, it means the liver energy has not arrived. If the liver energy has not arrived and one forcefully engages, it will harm the muscles, causing the essence to flow and drip without being released. If one is strong but not warm, it means the heart energy has not arrived. If the heart energy has not arrived and one forcefully engages, it will harm the blood, making the essence clear, cold, and unwelcoming. If one is firm but not enduring, it means the kidney energy has not arrived. If the kidney energy has not arrived and one forcefully engages, it will harm the bones, and the essence will not emerge, even if it does, it will be minimal. This is why men seek children; it is essential to cultivate a clear mind and few desires to nourish the energies of the liver, heart, and kidneys.</p>
<p>For women, there are five signs: when the face blushes, and beauty appears, it indicates the arrival of heart energy; when tears appear in the eyes and emotional glances are given, it indicates the arrival of liver energy; when a woman bows her head and does not speak, and there’s dripping from the nose, it indicates the arrival of lung energy; when they embrace closely and the body begins to move on its own, it indicates the arrival of spleen energy; when the jade gate opens, and the precious fluid flows, it indicates the arrival of kidney energy. When all five energies are present, only then can a man unite with her, engaging in the methods of Nine One, leading to harmonious feelings and delightful connections. There are also five conditions to observe: soft murmurs and gentle words, associated with the heart; closed eyes, associated with the liver; dry throat and gasping, associated with the lungs; legs bending or stretching, lying back like the moon, associated with the spleen; and cold breath from the mouth and nose, with fluid dripping from the female organ, associated with the kidneys. With these five conditions, it leads to extreme beauty and joy.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>When a man understands his feelings and pursues them, not only does he have offspring, but he also gains beneficial support. In the moments of male and female union, there are further taboos that must be approached with caution! If one transgresses these, heaven and earth will take away their lifespan, and spirits will bring calamity upon them. There is also the fear of giving birth to unworthy and short-lived offspring. By diligently observing these prohibitions, one can achieve longevity, and the important matters to avoid are detailed below.</p>
<p>The shaking of heaven and earth, sudden storms and heavy rains, the clash of thunder and lightning, the dark and bright phases of the moon, eclipses of the sun, extreme cold and heat, the solar and lunar eclipses, the birthdays of deities and Buddhas, the day of one&#39;s birth, the three festivals and eight sections, the fifth day of the fifth month, famous mountains and rivers, shrines and temples, the abodes of monks and Taoists, before the images of sages, and in front of wells and stoves, in the presence of fire’s brilliance — all these times and places are to be treated with caution; one must not engage in union. To violate these brings about premature death, illness, or, if it involves a man, it may result in an ugly and strange appearance, incomplete physical form, misfortunes, diseases, and an early death.</p>
<p>Excessive labor, mental distress, fear, anxiety, sorrow, worry, anger, the wandering of illness, flushed skin, yellow complexion, excessive drinking and eating, and a body just recovering from illness, as well as a woman during her menstrual period — these forms of taboo regarding union must not be breached, as they lead to depletion and the loss of vital energy.</p>
<p>All prohibitions have been laid out in detail, and there is also the eighteenth day of the fifth month, which marks the day of the Earth’s female year and the period of harmonious interaction between yin and yang. People must avoid this day and must not engage in sexual relations.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>If the offense is grave, it will lead to death; if light, it will shorten one’s life. If conception occurs at this time, both mother and child are difficult to preserve. </p>
<p>During the union of husband and wife, there are three voids and four prohibitions that must be observed. The three voids refer to: the winter solstice when yang is born but true fire is dormant, and the summer solstice when yin is born but true water is still weak; this constitutes the void of the year; the first quarter before the full moon and the last quarter after the full moon, when the moon is empty; this constitutes the void of the month; the darkening of heaven and earth, the sun and moon; this constitutes the void of the day. When encountering these three voids, one must exercise caution and avoid them.</p>
<p>The four prohibitions are: firstly, to avoid the day of one’s own heavenly stem in direct conflict, such as the day of the winter solstice and the day of the summer solstice; secondly, to avoid times of extreme cold, extreme heat, excessive drunkenness, or overindulgence in food; thirdly, to avoid places associated with the sun, moon, stars, temples, altars, or graves; fourthly, to steer clear of actions that cause anger, curses, or violence. Violating these three voids and four prohibitions not only results in childlessness but can also lead to premature death.</p>
<p>The method of seeding mentioned here is documented in various texts; if one follows it, there are no failures. However, I have a different viewpoint. It is common for the common folk in the fields, along with licentious women, to give birth despite possibly being unaware of this seeding method. They wait for the heavenly essence to awaken and open the door to conception, coinciding with the mating seasons of birds and beasts. They wait for males to approach three times and females five times before they achieve their full potential; this is the principle of yin and yang harmonizing, so subtle that words cannot fully express it. Moreover, the common folk display straightforward emotions that easily connect, while licentious women, with their deep thoughts and engaging emotions, facilitate the harmony of yin and yang resulting in higher fertility.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Secret Teachings</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When the cycle of the menstrual period is regular, men and women may unite. Within three days, one should enjoy the pleasures of the moment. The male yang and the female yin harmonize; when the yang sings, the yin responds. Dew drips from the autumn leaves, and jade-like grains can form; the spring wind blows through the peach blossoms, and golden scales leap naturally. The profound principles of heaven and earth are the foundation of life. Do not dismiss these words as mere idle talk fit for laughter.</p>
<p><strong>Seed Chapter</strong></p>
<p>For conception, the male must be robust and not diminished, while the female must be responsive and not averse; when yin and yang flow harmoniously, essence and blood unite, facilitating the formation of the fetus. Otherwise, if the yang is weak, it cannot align with the yin; if the yin is deficient, it cannot respond to the yang. Separation of yin and yang leads to childlessness. The essence of seed lies in a woman maintaining a calm heart and steady spirit. Indeed, as women serve others with their bodies, they often become anxious, desiring approval based on their beauty. At the slightest displeasure, they may feel worry, resentment, or anger. Worry binds the qi, thought causes stagnation, resentment obstructs qi, and anger raises it; blood flows with the qi, and if qi goes astray, the blood follows. Therefore, maintaining a calm heart and steady spirit is of utmost importance for women. As for medicinal remedies, they should take black chicken pills to nourish qi and blood and regulate their cycles, which is the correct approach. One must stay away from excessive remedies that deplete yang and consume blood, as these are detrimental. Childlessness in women is often due to menstrual irregularities; thus, support through medicine is especially critical and should not be delayed.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>If one does not regulate the menstrual cycle and align with it, but instead expends effort in unproductive areas, this regulation of the cycle is crucial for women’s fertility. Women inherently suffer from conditions of excess discharge; when their menstrual flow is irregular, they cannot conceive, which is referred to as a deficient lower source, unable to gather blood for fertilization. It is advisable to replenish this deficiency and restore balance using specific tonics like the Black Chicken Pill or the Guardian Pill.</p>
<p>The female reproductive quality is emblematic of the moon. If from the new moon to the full moon, the menstrual flow is consistent, conceiving is easy, and children often live long, as the moonlight gradually increases until full. However, if from the full moon to the new moon the menstrual flow fails to maintain its regularity, conception is difficult and many children face early death, mirroring the waning moonlight that diminishes and the moon&#39;s outline that becomes hollow. This is the principle of creation; can it be explained to the ignorant?</p>
<p>In general, for conception, at the right time, men should take tonics to nourish the kidneys and enhance essence, while women should regulate their diet, keeping flavors mild and avoiding extremes of heat and cold. At midnight, when life&#39;s energy is at its peak, follow the appropriate rhythms—three times going, five times coming, three times empty, and four times to be wary—and naturally, union will lead to pregnancy, and pregnancy will lead to successful births.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>The Secret Records of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Tuduo, Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Progeny</strong></p>
<p>To have offspring in life, although it is said to be a heavenly decree, is it not also a matter of human affairs? There are men who cannot father children, and women who cannot conceive. For men who cannot father children, there are six ailments. For women who cannot conceive, there are ten ailments. What are the six ailments? One is cold essence, one is declining energy, one is excess phlegm, one is excessive fiery essence, one is insufficient essence, and one is blocked energy. Cold essence refers to the coldness in the essence of the kidneys; even if it is released into the womb, the woman&#39;s body cannot accept it, and it will not be a month before it miscarries. Declining energy refers to the weakening of yang energy; when energy is low, one cannot engage in prolonged effort to stir the woman&#39;s heart; if the man&#39;s essence has already been emitted while the woman&#39;s essence has not yet mingled, how can life be conceived? Even if the essence is few and the man can still release it, it is certainly weak and thin, and when the womb&#39;s entrance opens wide, how can a small quantity satisfy? Therefore, it goes in and immediately comes out.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Those with excessive phlegm are often damp; excessive dampness leads to impure essence. If the essence is mixed, although conception may occur, the offspring is destined to perish. When the fire of vitality is strong and one endures prolonged battles, if the female essence has already passed while the male essence has yet to be released, and when the male essence is released but the female becomes quiescent, how can there be the prospect of reproduction? Stagnation of qi is due to the liver&#39;s energy being obstructed, unable to generate the heart’s warmth, leading to a harboring of worries, causing a lack of vigor in intimate matters. One may either have their joys extinguished or face sudden collapses; while women&#39;s springtime desires are strong, men&#39;s deep sighs arise. This results in desolate scenes, quiet rooms, an indelible longing for provisions, and scant laughter. How can one nurture jade in the blue fields or conceive a dragon in the fragrant chambers? Thus, for those with cold essence, warm their vitality; for those with weak qi, replenish their energy; for those with excessive phlegm, disperse it; for those with strong fire, nourish their water; for those with scant essence, augment their essence; and for those with stagnant qi, soothe their energy. This way, even men who feel powerless can still have offspring; merely supplementing the fire of vitality is not sufficient.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>What are the ten diseases? One is cold in the womb, one is cold in the spleen and stomach, one is urgency in the dai vessel, one is stagnation of liver qi, one is excess of phlegm and qi, one is exuberance of fire, one is deficiency of kidney water, one is illness of the governor and conducive vessels, one is dysfunction in bladder qi transformation, and one is deficiency of qi and blood, unable to sustain life. The pulse of the womb is what receives substances; warmth allows for life, while cold leads to death. Even if a man&#39;s essence is hot and enters, how can it be retained without being expelled? If the spleen and stomach are weak and cold, then the dai vessel will naturally be powerless; if the essence enters the womb, how can it function properly? The dai vessel should be slow, not urgent. If the dai vessel is urgent, it is due to problems with the waist and navel. If there are problems with the waist and navel, the womb will be weak; how can it sustain anything? If liver qi is stagnant, the heart will be uncomfortable; how can there be joy in the marital bed? If phlegm and qi are excessive, it is likely due to obesity; regardless of body size, if the lower body is overly plump and the uterus is constricted, it will be difficult to conceive. Even if a man is very healthy, bravely fighting, and ejaculation occurs directly, if dampness arises from the bladder, there will surely be the risk of overflow.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>Those with excessive fire disturbance burn and dry out the land, making it difficult for plants to grow. When kidney water is deficient, the uterus becomes dry, and seedlings lack the nourishing rain, leading to wilting and inevitable sorrow. If there are signs of hernia or blockage between the Ren and Du channels, the essence cannot be released, as it is obstructed externally. The bladder is close to the womb; if the transformation of qi is inefficient, the dampness will inevitably seep into the womb, preventing conception. For a woman to conceive, she must have ample qi and blood; if qi is deficient, yang declines, and if blood is deficient, yin declines. When both qi and blood are insufficient, the womb will sink and cannot rise, leading to miscarriage. Therefore, if the womb is cold, it must be warmed; if the spleen and stomach are cold, they need to be warmed; if the Dai vessel is tight, it should be relaxed; if liver qi is stagnant, it must be opened; if phlegm and qi are excessive, they need to be resolved; if fire is excessive, it should be balanced; if kidney water is deficient, it must be supplemented; if there are issues with the Ren and Du channels, they must be addressed; if bladder qi transformation is not functioning, support the kidney qi; if qi and blood cannot nourish the fetus, bolster the qi and blood. Thus, even women who are barren may conceive, and one cannot merely treat the womb in isolation.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Prescription</p>

<p>Preparation: Combine the seventeen ingredients with 5 sheng of clear wine and 6 sheng of water, boil down to one third, and divide into four doses. Take three times during the day and once at night, spacing each dose by three &quot;chen&quot; (about 6 hours). When taking, cover warmly; if little sweat appears, use a fire box in winter. This will eliminate stagnant blood and cool, red pus, similar to red bean juice. This is meant for women whose uterus contains such harmful substances, which may cause pain below the navel during damp weather or irregular menstrual flow due to cold blood preventing conception. If symptoms worsen, with weakness and severe distress, it is permissible to take more doses; however, two to three doses should suffice. If the distress is overwhelming, a mouthful of vinegar with cold liquid may be taken to stop it. Nevertheless, if the harmful substances are not fully expelled, the medicinal power will not be fully realized; enduring the full treatment is ideal.

Dai inquired about the reason, to which the soldier replied: &quot;When I returned home as a bride, there was a chill in my heart, like a covered cup. When pressed, it sounded like water; when warmed by my hand, it felt like ice. It has been fifteen years since we married, and I fear that I may have no heirs, hence I wish to dismiss her.&quot; Dai said: &quot;Do not dismiss her; if you use my medicine, the illness can be cured, and you may achieve pregnancy.&quot; The soldier followed his advice. Dai diagnosed the soldier&#39;s pulse to be deep and slow, while the pulse at the wrist was strong and forceful, indicating that he was not without the potential for children. He could likely conceive within the year. First, he prescribed San Sheng San to induce vomiting of a bucket of phlegm and to soften the area of the heart. Next, he administered Baizhu Tiaozhong Decoction and Wuqin San; afterward, he mixed in Siwu Decoction. Within two months, the energies and blood harmonized, and after several months, he conceived a son. Dai often said: &quot;With this method, no woman is without children.&quot; This is truly not a falsehood.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: A friend’s wife, although her body is robust and well-proportioned, has, despite careful attention to her condition, never been able to conceive. So I instructed a servant to prepare a remedy for her, one that has not been recorded in ancient medical texts, but can certainly be discussed. There are five reasons why a mountain cannot be buried: if a child is blocked by a stone, even with a wise teacher, there is no way to apply the necessary measures; hence, a girl cannot conceive. As written in the medical texts, if one’s natural constitution is different, it cannot be changed by human effort, thus needing no further discussion. However, in cases where the natural constitution is not different but hindered by bodily issues, there are countless instances, both ancient and modern, of successful pregnancies. Yet, the foolishness of couples, the natural harmony that makes them compatible, even the most skilled cannot guarantee fertility, and thus the medical texts are lacking in this regard. I propose that the essence of the earth is inherently substantial, yet it relies on the influence of weather for vitality to persist. In areas of heavy cold and dampness, where sunlight fails to shine, life rarely thrives. The human body, rich in muscle and full of blood, is a beautiful thing; however, when blood is abundant, it can easily lead to a depletion of vital energy.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>The interaction between qi and blood is intricate; how can one be weak or strong while the other is not? Qi is the master, thus blood flows; when blood is dominant, qi does not flow properly. When qi ceases to flow, it resembles a decline. Therefore, all medications that tonify qi should not be used, while those that drain qi might be beneficial, as nourishing qi could cause stagnation. It is better to reduce it to facilitate its movement, and over time, blood will return to its proper control.</p>
<p>When Duke Huayang became pregnant but could not give birth due to excessive body weight, a knowledgeable person prescribed a method harmful to the fetus, and after taking several doses, she was able to deliver smoothly, ensuring the safety of both mother and child. Due to her plump body, the fetus had no space, so the medications merely drained the external flesh and blood but could not exhaust the true essence within.</p>
<p>I formulated a prescription based on this understanding, preparing for the ideal conditions for conception. Is it not a skill to create? For a woman with a suitable partner, she must first calm her heart; a tranquil heart leads to harmonious qi, and harmonious qi is conducive to flowing and filling. Next, she should regulate her diet, maintaining a clean physique, often practicing fasting to achieve a slender waist in the womb, tolerating hunger and focusing her will to move qi; what can’t be accomplished with such effort?</p>
<p>Moreover, by aligning hearts and nurturing virtue, and through the teachings of spiritual paths, can even tonics fall short? I seek pearls in Hepu and find joy in cultivating jade in Lantian.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a girl reaches the age of fourteen, her heavenly essence (Tian Gui) arrives, the Ren (Conception) vessel opens, the Tai Chong (Penetrating) vessel is abundant, and her monthly cycle descends regularly, hence she is capable of bearing children. <strong>[Note: Tian Gui refers to the essence produced by Heavenly Yi, represented by the watery essence. Ren and Chong are extraordinary channels. Both vessels arise from within the lower abdomen, flowing upward, acting as the sea of menstrual blood, essential for women to nurture their wombs. The moon represents yin, and women also represent yin; the moon cycles monthly, waxing and waning, therefore women also menstruate monthly as a timely outflow. When there is depletion, it can renew, hence at the beginning of life, when male and female seeds unite, they are destined to conceive. If the essence is deficient, the capacity to conceive is easily affected.</strong>] At the age of twenty-one, if the Ren vessel is deficient, the Tai Chong vessel is weak, the heavenly essence is drained, and the pathways of earth (the body&#39;s channels) are blocked, then one&#39;s physique deteriorates, and they cannot bear children. <strong>[Note: The pathways of earth refer to the lower channels, associated with the foot&#39;s lesser yin. The drainage of Tian Gui indicates a blockage in the lower pathways. The deficiency of Ren and Chong results in the body weakening, leading to an inability to conceive.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The Difficult Classic of Bian Que</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gate of Life Connects to the Uterus</strong></p>
<p>Each organ has one ear, but the kidneys uniquely possess two; however, not all are kidneys. The left one is the kidney, and the right one is the Gate of Life. The Gate of Life is where the essence of all spirits resides, and it is connected to the original qi. It is where men store their essence and women connect to their uterus.</p>
<p><strong>The Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br>[Written by Sun Simiao during the Tang Dynasty]</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Seeking Children</strong></p>
<p>The distinctions between men and women arise from differences in conception, pregnancy, and childbirth. Thus, a woman’s illnesses are ten times more difficult to treat compared to a man’s. The classics state that women are the gathering place of yin, constantly residing with dampness. After the age of fourteen, the yin energy overflows, causing myriad thoughts to disturb the heart, injuring the five organs internally and damaging one&#39;s appearance externally. The menstrual cycles fluctuate, alternating between arrival and departure, while stagnant blood congeals, blocking pathways and interrupting natural flow, leading to miscarriages that are difficult to discuss. The interplay of the five organs is complicated, with deficiency and excess intertwined, leading to the leaking of bad blood and depletion of qi. Sometimes due to excessive eating and drinking, injuries are compounded; at other times, existing wounds remain unresolved, leading to imbalances of yin and yang. Additionally, exposure to cold winds from improper sanitation can manifest as twelve chronic illnesses, which is why women require distinct treatments.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the seasonal changes are considered a sickness, and the balance of yin and yang, heat and cold, affect the patient, then they are the same as men. However, a woman who is pregnant and suffering from illness should avoid toxic remedies. The various ailments shared with men are scattered throughout many texts and can be understood. Yet, women tend to have greater desires than men, and thus are more susceptible to illness, compounded by their deep emotions of love, hate, jealousy, and anxiety, which entrench their conditions, making healing difficult. Therefore, those who care for health must specifically teach daughters the three volumes of women&#39;s remedies, enabling them to understand thoroughly, so that in times of urgency, they need not be fearful.</p>
<p>The four virtues are fundamental for women’s lives; childbirth and nurturing are essential aspects of a woman’s existence. If one is not well-versed in these matters, how can one avoid premature death? Thus, the teachings of mothers cannot be neglected either. </p>
<p>It is advisable to copy a book for personal reference to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Human nature wishes to excel oneself while resenting others’ success; but when it comes to knowledge, people often follow their feelings, getting lost in affairs, and seldom dedicate themselves to pursuing the ultimate truths, thus wasting time meaninglessly throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Marriage and parenting are the foundation of human relationships and the basis of governance. The wise set forth teachings, articulating their intentions, yet future generations may not grasp them thoroughly. When faced with real situations, they may appear confused and foolish; this is a wrongful desire to excel personally without understanding others. Such individuals truly miss the essence of self-improvement and instead pursue empty fame, resulting in futility.</p>
<p>Now I present the methods of seeking offspring, which may benefit future generations; like-minded individuals may find this useful.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To seek an offspring, one must first understand the spouses&#39; destinies, the interactions of the five elements, and their moral alignment. If their destinies are not positioned in the grave of barrenness or death, then one can certainly conceive. However, if their destinies present conflicts among the five elements, or encounter violent disruptions, and are situated in the grave of barrenness or death, then conception becomes impossible; be very cautious not to act hastily! Even if a child is conceived, it will ultimately bring trouble later on. Yet, if their elements are harmonious and they encounter blessings and virtue, they must still adhere to the proper methods and avoid all taboos. The offspring born will be excellent and outstanding, difficult to fully describe.</p>
<p>For those without children, it is often due to both spouses suffering from the five labors and seven injuries, leading to various ailments, hence the risk of lacking heirs. The remedy for this is for the man to take the &quot;Seven Sons Powder&quot; and for the woman to take &quot;Purple Stone Asparagus Pills,&quot; along with the herbal concoction for cleansing the womb; all will yield children. In ancient times, those seeking offspring frequently used &quot;Celebratory Cloud Powder&quot; and &quot;Accommodating Blessing Pills,&quot; but in modern times, these are seldom used.

If it is too shallow, it aligns with the realm of less yang, a harmonious way, thus it can produce life. Therefore, the place of conception is shallow, not deep. It is also forbidden to engage in matters right after menstruation. Only on the first day after menstruation can it be male, on the second day female, on the third day male; beyond these, no successful conception will occur. Great winds and heavy rains, extreme cold and heat, eclipses of the sun and moon, all these times should not be engaged in, as any offspring will be foolish, deaf, and physically incomplete.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Women&#39;s Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Chen Ziming)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seeking Sons</strong>  </p>
<p>The wife of Prince Xiaowang of Jianping, Ji, was beautiful but bore no children. A selection was made for young unmarried girls from common families to enter the palace, yet still, there were no children. The question arose: Is there a way to seek sons? Cheng replied: A union of man and woman must take place at the right age. Although a boy may understand matters at sixteen, he should marry at thirty; though a girl may receive her first menstruation at fourteen, she should marry at twenty. The union must ensure that yin and yang are fully developed before conception can occur, leading to pregnancy and raising a strong, healthy, and long-lived child. If a girl is not yet of age, and her first menstruation is approaching, she is too close to male attraction; if her yin energy is depleted prematurely, it may cause injury before maturity, leading to unsuccessful conception and weak offspring. This is why the prince has no children. However, if a woman produces only daughters or only sons, if the King can indeed seek many women who produce sons to the palace, there is a method for obtaining sons. The King replied: Good. Before long, six sons were born. Old yang meets young yin, old yin meets young yang; this is also a method for having children. </p>
<p>Where there is a husband and wife, there is a father and son. After marital union, the search for heirs is essential, thus the ancients said there are three forms of unfilial conduct, of which having no heirs is the most significant, emphasizing the weight of continuing the lineage. All who desire children should first examine whether there are any burdensome illnesses or injuries affecting the couple, and by following prescribed remedies and treatments, peace between inner and outer conditions can be achieved, leading to the birth of children.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Notes: According to Master Danxi, the process of conception in humans is initiated by the application of yang essence, which the yin blood can subsequently nourish. The essence contributes to the formation of the child, while the blood contributes to the development of the womb, leading to successful pregnancy. If a woman does not conceive, it is usually due to insufficient blood to capture the essence. The deficiency of blood can arise from multiple reasons. However, those who wish to conceive must replenish their essence and blood to avoid deficiency, as this is essential for successful pregnancy. I humbly suggest that a woman&#39;s infertility can also result from the harm caused by the disturbances of the six emotions and seven feelings affecting the conception and reception mechanisms, lingering illnesses that have affected the internal organs, a cold and weak uterus, excessive qi with declining blood, or hidden heat within the blood; additionally, a deficiency in the spleen and stomach can hinder the nourishment of the reproductive organs. It is also crucial to assess the man&#39;s physical condition, whether he has kidney deficiency and weak essence that prevents conception, or if he has inherently poor vitality and depleted qi and blood, or if he indulges excessively and his yin essence is exhausted. Each individual should identify the root cause and address it accordingly. In general, one should examine the pulse of both males and females; if the right wrist pulse is thin or weak, one should use the Bawei Pill; if the left wrist pulse is strong and lacks strength upon palpation, the Liuwai Pill should be used; if both wrist pulses are either thin or excessively strong, the Shibu Pill is recommended. Additionally, as the Chao clan mentions, if the couple’s ages are incompatible or if there are adverse influences from graves, it may be a factor. If one mistakenly uses warming and drying herbs, it will not only be ineffective but may also cause harm.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Childlessness</h3>
<p>The reasons for childlessness can be categorized into three: First, unfavorable conditions of the grave and feng shui; second, conflict in the life spans of the couple; third, illness of the couple. Unfavorable graves and conflicting life spans cannot be remedied with medicine. However, if the couple is ill, medication is necessary. A woman may be childless due to labor damaging her qi and blood, menstrual complications, or issues like excessive bleeding or discharge. If the pulse at the right wrist is floating, it indicates male infertility, whereas a weak pulse at the wrist or at both positions indicates sterility. Mismanagement of lifestyle, irregular diet, exposure to wind and cold, all can lead to infertility as well.</p>
<h3>Prohibitions on Conception</h3>
<p>When seeking to conceive, it is advisable to choose auspicious days and avoid conflicts associated with the fire element, particularly during full moons and new moons, as well as during severe weather such as storms, thunder, or extreme temperatures. It is also important to avoid days when the sun and moon are obscured, when earthquakes occur, or when there are signs of abnormal phenomena concerning celestial bodies, altars, wells, kitchens, latrines, or graves. If conception occurs during these inauspicious times, it can lead to many problems: children may be born disabled, untimely, or foolish and unfilial. However, if intercourse is timed correctly, it can result in children blessed with virtue and wisdom. This is a matter of significant impact, thus one should not be careless!<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chao&#39;s discussion states: Yang induces Yin transformation, and when精气 (vital energy) is abundant, two embryos can be both male and female. The Daoist texts say: If a woman has intercourse on the first, third, or fifth day after her monthly cycle, and it coincides with auspicious days for boys and girls, it is likely to result in a male child. If both parents are robust, it leads to many children; if one is weak, it results in fewer children. The Lu Nao text states: When Yang is abundant, Yin will develop into a male, and all six meridians will elevate Yin. It also states: When three Yang energies converge, a male is born; when three Yin energies converge, a female is born. Ge Xianweng&#39;s &quot;Zhou Hou Fang&quot; claims: Males derive from paternal energy, while females derive from maternal energy. The Sheng Ji text states: The virtue of heaven and the energy of earth combine Yin and Yang harmoniously, flowing in one entity. If the energy moves left, it is associated with Yang, resulting in a male; if it moves right, it is associated with Yin, resulting in a female. The I Ching asserts that the Qi of the Sky produces males, while the Qi of the Earth produces females; this marks the distinction between the two genders.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: According to Dongyuan and Danxi, after the cessation of menstrual flow, one or two days later, the blood sea begins to clear, and if the male essence prevails over the blood, a boy is conceived; if four or five days later the blood vessels are vigorous, and the essence does not prevail over the blood, a girl is conceived. It is understood that the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood meet because of this interaction. When the essence acts, the blood can nourish the essence, resulting in a child, which begins with the male principle. Conversely, when the blood flows and the essence cannot overtake it, a girl is born, originating from the female principle. The interaction of yin and yang leads to the formation of the embryo, which is housed in the uterus, a singular structure below, branching into two, one leading left and the other right. If the essence surpasses the blood, the yang rules and the energy from the left uterus produces a boy; if the essence does not prevail, the yin rules and the energy from the right uterus produces a girl.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on Receiving Form</strong></p>
<p>The Zhu family states: The union of male and female involves the interaction of their essences. The yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence; the blood envelops the essence, which then enters to form bones, resulting in the creation of a male. Conversely, if the yang essence enters first, with the yin blood following, the essence envelops the blood, which then forms the foundation, resulting in the creation of a female. </p>
<p>Yang energy gathers at the face, which is why males have heavier features, and those who die by drowning must be face down. Yin energy gathers at the back, hence females have heavier backs, and those who die by drowning must be face up. This applies to both beasts and humans regardless of position in death. </p>
<p>When yin and yang equally arrive, there is neither male nor female body; the essence and blood disperse equally, showing signs of multiple pregnancies. If the father is young and the mother old, the daughter will likely be weak; if the mother is strong and the father weak, the son will likely be frail. </p>
<p>Ancient skilled craftspeople first observed this. When energy is unevenly exhausted, they compensate accordingly. To nourish a weak daughter, they should strengthen her blood and spleen; to bolster a frail son, they should fortify his spleen and regulate his complexion. Weak daughters ought to marry in a timely manner, while frail sons should wait until they are strong to marry. This constitutes the foundation of issues arising from external circumstances and must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Production of Treasures</strong></p>
<p>Generally, when treating illnesses, one first considers what is central to the issue: for men, it involves regulating Qi, and for women, it involves regulating blood. Qi and blood are the essence of a person. In women, blood is fundamental; if they can diligently take care of it, then Qi and blood circulate smoothly, and their spirit becomes clear. Monthly cycles occur as expected, and blood coagulates to form pregnancy. However, if the spleen and stomach are weak, they cannot properly digest food; if the nourishment and protective energies are insufficient, menstruation will not occur. This may lead to pale skin, a lack of luster in the face, abdominal pain from cold or heat, and difficulties in childbearing. In some cases, there may be excessive vaginal discharge or bleeding, leading to conditions like masses. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: If a woman has long-standing weakness of the spleen and stomach, causing both Qi and blood to decline, leading to irregular menstruation, it is advisable to tonify the spleen&#39;s Qi and nourish the source of transformation. Alternatively, if there is middle burner heat causing a lack of fluids, resulting in the drying up of the blood sea, one should clear the stomach and tonify the spleen, allowing the cycle to resume. The classic says: the stomach is the source of protection, and the spleen is the basis of nourishment. The &quot;Acupuncture Canon&quot; states that nourishment emerges from the middle burner and protection from the upper burner. If protective energy is insufficient, it must be supplemented with pungents; if nourishment is deficient, it must be replenished with sweetness. The combination of sweet and pungent harmonizes the spleen and stomach, enhancing nourishment and protection, thereby invigorating both Qi and blood. If one suffers from excessive mental strain leading to vacuous fire acting erratically, causing irregular menstruation, it is advisable to calm the mind, replenish blood, and drain excess fire—this is the treatment method of Master Dong Yuan.]</strong><a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p>A woman&#39;s Qi is weak due to her blood, which is why she cannot have children; it is advisable to suppress her Qi and disperse it. Indeed, Xiangfuzi is the miraculous medicine for women, and it should not be said to deplete true Qi to avoid taking it. If a woman&#39;s blood is weak, the generative organs may become cold and stagnant, leading to fewer children; thus, the use of amethyst is recommended. </p>

This can result in nausea and loss of appetite, and in severe cases, it can cause convulsions in the hands and feet.

The thirty-six ailments include seven symptoms, eight masses, nine pains, and twelve types of leucorrhea. However, the so-called twelve types of leucorrhea do not specify their symptoms in detail, and what people suffer from today is mainly just two types of leucorrhea. The cause of these ailments, when traced, is overexertion leading to exhaustion, deficiencies in the Chong and Ren meridians, and exposure to wind and cold affecting the uterus. </p>
<p>Moreover, during normal times, women should have adequate blood and less qi, which contributes to health and prevents diseases. If qi becomes excessive compared to blood, it may generate cold, causing blood to fail to transform into red, resulting in white discharge; if qi is balanced but blood is insufficient, insufficient blood generates heat, causing blood to fail to transform into red, resulting in red discharge; when cold and heat coexist, both red and white discharges occur along with symptoms. </p>
<p>For virgins who, after marriage, suffer from deficiencies leading to this ailment, it can prevent them from conceiving, leading to the end of their lineage. Anyone with these symptoms should seek treatment promptly, as neglecting it can lead to dark complexion, emaciation, abdominal distension, sharp pains, and severe coldness in the limbs, ultimately affecting appetite. </p>

Alternatively, use Wuyou San to expel over ten measures; following this, consume onion vinegar white porridge for three to five days.

In this case, it is advisable to cool the blood and kindle the fire, or to use Siwu Decoction with Xiangfu, Huangqin, and Chaihu to nourish the blood and yin. Dongyuan has the Liuwuwei Dihuang Wan to replenish the yin and blood of women who lack offspring; those who take it can achieve conception.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Inappropriateness of Using Qin Gui Pill for Infertility</strong></p>
<p>The causes of infertility largely stem from women. Physicians do not seek to understand the source of the issue; instead, they indiscriminately review ancient remedies. The Qin Gui Pill is notably mentioned, as it is seen as a definitive treatment. Its principle is to use warm and hot medicines that are close to human nature, which people willingly take, boldly consume, and suffer the burning consequences without realizing their recklessness. Why is this? The essence of yang must be applied, and the blood of yin must be able to capture it; the essence creates the child, and the blood forms the embryo, allowing conception to come about. </p>
<p>Currently, women who are infertile usually have insufficient blood to capture the essence. The deficiency of blood is not due to a single cause. However, those desiring children must nourish the yin blood, ensuring there are no deficiencies, so that they may draw on any surplus to nurture pregnancy. Yet, they lightly resort to hot agents, boiling their organs, causing the blood and qi to bubble and boil, leading to immediate disaster. </p>
<p>Some say: &quot;In spring, the warmth nurtures all life, and in winter, the cold causes all to wither.&quot; If not for the warmth of the Qin Gui Pill, how could one expect the organs to warm up and lead to pregnancy? I reply: Poetry says that if women are harmonious and peaceful, they will joyously have children. Harmony means the blood and qi are not at odds; peace ensures yin and yang do not contend. </p>
<p>Using this medicine, the menstrual blood must certainly turn purple and black, gradually decreasing in quantity, whether quickly or slowly. Initially, the appetite may surge, but over time, the mouth becomes bitter and dry, yin and yang become unbalanced, and the blood and qi do not harmonize. Illnesses arise in swarms; how can one expect to conceive? Even if conception occurs, the children are often frail and not long-lived, as the Qin Gui Pill damages the natural essence of yin. One must be cautious and wary.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Theory of Conception</h3>
<p>The theory regarding the differentiation of male and female after conception from the essence and blood, as presented by Chu Cheng, confounds me. Later, I reviewed the writings of Li Dongyuan, which state: if the menstrual flow ceases for one or two days, and the blood pool begins to clear, then if the essence prevails over the blood, a male is conceived; if four or five days later, the blood vessels are robust and the essence cannot surpass the blood, a female is conceived. This is indeed a sound theory. The Book of Changes states: the dry principle produces males, while the receptive principle produces females. The concepts of &#39;dry&#39; and &#39;receptive&#39; reflect the nature of yin and yang; the left and right represent the paths of yin and yang; and male and female symbolize the forms of yin and yang. The paternal essence and maternal blood meet through interaction. The essence initiates creation, while the blood nurtures. The essence produces the child, and thus all things begin with the dry origin; the blood forms the womb, and all things arise from the receptive origin. When yin and yang unite, conception occurs, and the place where this occurs is called the uterus. It has a connection below, with two branches above, one leading to the left and one to the right.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the essence prevails over the blood, the Yang is the master, receiving qi from the left ovary, resulting in the formation of a male; when the essence does not prevail against the blood, the Yin is the master, receiving qi from the right ovary, resulting in the formation of a female. It is said that the division of male and female is understood. A male cannot be a father, a female cannot be a mother; how then should we differentiate those who possess both male and female traits? I say: a male cannot be a father if he suffers from a deficiency of Yang energy. A female cannot be a mother if she suffers from an obstruction of Yin energy. Those with both traits are formed when Yin is influenced by the mixed qi, thus varying in essence. There are two kinds of females with male traits: one meets a man as a wife and a woman as a husband; the other can be a wife but cannot be a husband. Those females who possess the entirety of male traits represent a more pronounced mixture. It is questioned whether the mixed qi only appears in the Yin, and whether the forms influenced vary similarly. I reply: the Yin body is weak, thus the mixed qi is easy to influence. When affected by mixed qi, Yin and Yang intermingle without a clear master, belonging neither to the left nor the right, receiving qi from the space between the two paths, and forming based on the weight of the mixed qi. Therefore, the forms that combine male and female traits cannot be uniformly categorized. </p>

<p><strong>Discussion on Remedies</strong></p>
<p>The Chóngsī pill, when adjusted properly, allows for intercourse seven days after consumption and should be avoided once pregnancy occurs. The Warm Umbilical Seed formula is especially suitable for women. When feeling warmth in the umbilical area, one should stop, and if needed, wait a few days before applying moxibustion again; excessive treatment can generate heat. The Warm Umbilical Belly formula is suitable for women whose meridians are not balanced and who have not conceived for a long time. It should be avoided by those who are pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Seeking Children</strong></p>
<p>Hu Xu said: In the intercourse of men and women, the formation of a fetus, although it stems from the essence and blood, also consists of postnatal impurities. A spark of pre-natal true essence arises from the feelings of desire, which harmonizes with it. This is what Zhu Xi referred to in discussing the initial stages of life and what the &quot;True Understanding&quot; text referred to as the beginning of corporeal life receiving qi. The skilled doctor, when faced with infertility, will address the man regarding essence and the woman regarding blood. Thus, remedies are formulated, emphasizing kidney supplementation for men and menstrual regulation for women, supplemented further by qi tonification and movement. By examining the pulse and understanding the imbalances, treatment can be tailored, leading to successful conception, ensuring that every man can become a father and every woman a mother.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Summary of the Chronicle of Guanci (Ming Dynasty, Wanquan)</h3>
<h4>Chapter on Moderation of Desires</h4>
<p>Men flourish in vitality when they seek a spouse, while women thrive in blood when they conceive. The matching of men and women is fundamental for procreation, continuing the patterns of behavior and social norms, and its significance is not trivial. The methods for seeking offspring should be approached seriously. For men, vitality is key, while for women, blood is essential. When male essence flows freely and is abundant, and female blood descends regularly without disruption, the harmonious interaction of yin and yang allows for the blending of essence and blood, resulting in the formation of embryos and the nourishment of life. Otherwise, if the masculine energy weakens, it cannot fulfill its requirements for the feminine energy; if the feminine energy diminishes, it cannot align with the masculine, leading to discord between yin and yang, and a separation of essence and blood, thus resulting in infertility. Those who do not comprehend this often violate the principles of nature, erroneously devising methods to seek progeny, while relying on the cycle of the five elements for nurturing and supplementing through medicines and foods, attempting to falsify reality and defy nature. Even if one manages to achieve conception, many face difficulties in nurturing or carrying to term. </p>
<p>In ancient times, men married after thirty and women after twenty, as noted in the writings of the Chu family, for fear of harming their essence and blood. Hence, in the pursuit of offspring, men should cultivate a clear mind and moderate desires to nurture their essence; women should maintain a calm and stable heart to cultivate their blood.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of a man must be abundant for his spirit to be lively; when his will is joyful, his spirit must be unrestrained. If one does not know how to regulate this, the spirit easily becomes scattered. If one does not understand how to maintain form, abundance easily turns to deficiency. Thus, his essence is often insufficient, unable to overflow or spill forth. This is why men value a tranquil heart and few desires, nurturing their essence.</p>
<p>The nature of women is narrow and quick to anger; their emotions are charming and easily stirred. Being quick to anger leads to much resentment and reverses their energy; being easily stirred leads to excessive interactions and depletion. When energy is reversed, blood is insufficient and cannot nourish, resulting in irregular menstrual cycles. Therefore, women value a calm heart and stable intentions, nurturing their blood.</p>
<p>Men&#39;s essence and women&#39;s blood are hard to maintain and easy to lose. When the easily lost essence is accompanied by insatiable desires, it fails again and again, thus men do not reach maturity by age sixteen, and women do not by age fourteen, leading to early decline. I have observed men near women—spending one night together multiple times; initially, there is essence, then clear fluid, and afterward, blood, leading to severe depletion.</p>
<p>The blood of women is said to diminish in seven ways: it transforms into breast milk above and menstrual blood below. The waters of intercourse seep and mix with the muddled, leaking substances from within, all are the blood of the body. Adding to this the frequency of childbirth, can it not lead to continual decline? Hence, in the quest for children, men must enrich their essence, and women must enrich their blood, regulated by propriety and properly timed, without excess.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p>Male essence and female blood combine to form a fetus. The child&#39;s shape resembles that of the parents, as it has a definite origin.

<p>For weak men and frail women, the methods of nurturing are what those seeking children must discuss. For a strong man and robust woman, with abundant essence and blood, children will naturally arise, so no supplementation is needed. However, for men who are weak and constantly lack essence, they should strengthen their kidneys to enhance their essence; for frail women, who frequently lack blood, they should strengthen their spleen to nourish their blood. To strengthen the kidneys, one can use the Six Flavors Rehmannia Decoction, with the addition of Schisandra and processed Aconite for cold essence.

<p>The Seed Song says: “At thirty, two and a half days have passed; on the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, one must calculate. Fallen petals cover the ground, marking an auspicious time; the golden water has stirred, causing disorder. In times of chaos, efforts are wasted; one seeks remnants of red among the trees, both high and low. If one understands the blooming of flowers, there’s no worry that the red osmanthus won’t cluster together.” </p>
<p>This means when a woman’s menstruation has just ended, and the golden water has just begun; at this moment, the uterus opens, indicating the time for conception. It coincides perfectly with the time of harmony. After this auspicious period, the uterus closes and cannot conceive. However, there are unique secrets for men and women. For example, if conception occurs right after menstruation—on the first, third, or fifth day, it results in a boy; on the second, fourth, or sixth day, it results in a girl. Beyond this, there will be no pregnancy.</p>
<p>The conclusion states: “What is the method for seed? Within the classics, it inquires about the reasons. Yesterday, red flowers fell; today it corresponds to the surrounding. In Lantian, white jade is planted; between noon and midnight, threads of silk weave together. Three and five days yield the red osmanthus; two and four days bring forth white plums.” </p>
<p>This refers to the time before water in the ancient scriptures; the sea of blood is full, and the uterus has not opened, so it cannot conceive. Once the menstruation has occurred, the uterus opens and the sea of blood is cleared, enabling it to accept the essence. “Yesterday” refers to two and a half days later. “Between noon and midnight” indicates the beginning of the interplay of yin and yang, aligning with the hexagram Jiou, not merely the two times.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p>The secret says: The jade lake must be shallow, heavy burdens only bring worries. Yin blood gathers first, while yang essence flows later. When blood opens, it wraps the jade dew, and one steps lightly to Penglai. The shallow approach refers to the method of &quot;nine shallow and one deep&quot; as mentioned in &quot;The Book of the Plain Girl.&quot; Thus, in the union of man and woman, if shallow, the girl is beautiful; if deep, the girl is harmed, hence &quot;heavy burdens only bring worries.&quot; If yin blood gathers first and yang essence flows later, blood opens to wrap essence and a boy is produced; if yang essence arrives first and yin blood gathers later, essence opens to wrap blood and a girl is produced.

This refers to after the seed is planted, the man should sleep apart, avoiding further intercourse, as the essence and blood are just beginning to coagulate, fearing another impact. Therefore, in ancient times, when a woman became pregnant, she would live in a side chamber to nurture her fetal energy.

At this time, the methods of prenatal education must not be neglected; hence, one should often listen to beautiful words, witness good deeds, hear poetry and literature, and practice archery. It is imperative to avoid lascivious sounds and immoral sights.</p>
<p>The admonition states: When menstruation first arrives, it is called &quot;red lead,&quot; and it lasts for thirty days. The auspicious time is not to be missed. The old impurities have been expelled, and the new beginnings have not yet emerged. The uterus has properly opened, and the precious seeds are sown in fertile fields. The male principle is strong; do not let the process be burdensome. Do not let the energy become discordant; ensure that the emotions are joyful. When the male and female principles unite in harmony, may the rain be timely and the winds be gentle. The fragrant flowers bear fruits, and the red osmanthus flourishes.</p>
<p>The seeds must receive the blessings of Heaven and Moon, harmonizing the Triple Harmony and the Six Harmonies for a favorable continuation into the future; the days are auspicious. In the first month, Ding, Ren, Bing, and Xin bring about initiation and closure. In the second month, Shen, Si, Jia, and Ji establish stability and resolve dangers. In the third month, Ding and Ren conduct initiation and closure. In the fourth month, Xin, Bing, Geng, and Yi lead to fullness and opening. In the fifth month, Hai, Yin, Bing, and Xin result in initiation, continuation, and removal. In the sixth month, Jia and Ji bring about removal, fullness, and opening.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the twelfth month of the Gengyin year, the construction is completed and the gates are opened. [The outer construction opening aligns with the heavenly joy, and it will surely benefit future generations within.] The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: Heaven and Earth unite, and all things transform into essence; men and women merge their vital energies, and all things give birth. Truly, this is an accurate statement. When men and women are both pleased, the interaction of yin and yang brings about the formation of the embryo. Consider the praise in the &quot;Songs of Zhou&quot;: When a man cherishes his wife and has the support of his companions, the affection between husband and wife, even in the fields, is never forgotten. Thus, between the mat and pillow, though their bodies may not yet intermingle, their spirits have already connected; the male essence is imparted, and the female receives, leading to conception. However, if the husband delights in his wife yet she is not satisfied, their bodies may touch, the essence may be initially released, but if the female does not receive, conception will not occur. If the wife follows her husband but his will differs, then it is like waves of peaches crashing but the frost of jade has no drop; thus, the female blood may open but there is no entry from the male. When yin and yang are at odds, the conjunction of heaven and earth cannot occur; how then can all things be transformed and birthed? The method for seeking a child requires careful observation: After a woman’s menstrual flow has completed and during the four auspicious days, when her womb is opened, intercourse can occur to conceive a child. During spring on the days of Jia and Yi in the months of Yin and Mao, in summer on the days of Bing and Ding in the months of Si and Wu, in autumn on the days of Geng and Xin in the months of Shen and You, and in winter on the days of Ren and Gui in the months of Hai and Zi, as well as on the days of Wu and Ji in the months of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. If these days are not suitable, one should choose auspicious times to carry it out.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Fan Sheng Jing&quot; states: At the time of union, a woman has five signs of injury: First, if her vagina is still closed and cannot open, forcing penetration could harm the lungs. Second, if the woman desires the man but he does not respond, and if desire surpasses the initial union, it could harm the heart and disrupt the menstrual cycle. Third, if a young yin encounters an old yang, the phallus may not be firm, and if it enters but cannot move, it could harm the woman&#39;s eyes, potentially leading to blindness. Fourth, if the woman&#39;s menstrual flow has not fully ended and the man forces the union, it could injure her kidneys. Fifth, if a man is heavily intoxicated and engages with a woman, though he is firm and continues for a long time, if the woman has already passed her desire, excessive stimulation could harm her abdomen. These five signs of injury must be taken seriously by those desiring children at the time of union.</p>
<p>Before men and women unite, there are three conditions for men and five for women. When their feelings are stirred and they connect spiritually before engaging, the yin and yang harmonize, and their essence and blood coalesce, leading to the possibility of conception. However, if the man&#39;s feelings have reached their peak while the woman&#39;s have not, it results in premature ejaculation, referred to as solitary yang. Conversely, if the woman&#39;s feelings are stirred but the man&#39;s are not, and she has already passed her peak desire, it is called deficient yin. The &quot;Yu Han Jing&quot; says that solitary yang and deficient yin do not lead to conception, as in the case of a widower and a widow, who are unable to conceive.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

When all three are present, it brings pleasure to a woman’s heart. If one is weak and cannot perform, it means the liver energy has not arrived. If the liver energy has not arrived and one forcefully engages, it will harm the muscles, causing the essence to flow and drip without being released. If one is strong but not warm, it means the heart energy has not arrived. If the heart energy has not arrived and one forcefully engages, it will harm the blood, making the essence clear, cold, and unwelcoming. If one is firm but not enduring, it means the kidney energy has not arrived. If the kidney energy has not arrived and one forcefully engages, it will harm the bones, and the essence will not emerge, even if it does, it will be minimal. This is why men seek children; it is essential to cultivate a clear mind and few desires to nourish the energies of the liver, heart, and kidneys.</p>
<p>For women, there are five signs: when the face blushes, and beauty appears, it indicates the arrival of heart energy; when tears appear in the eyes and emotional glances are given, it indicates the arrival of liver energy; when a woman bows her head and does not speak, and there’s dripping from the nose, it indicates the arrival of lung energy; when they embrace closely and the body begins to move on its own, it indicates the arrival of spleen energy; when the jade gate opens, and the precious fluid flows, it indicates the arrival of kidney energy. When all five energies are present, only then can a man unite with her, engaging in the methods of Nine One, leading to harmonious feelings and delightful connections. There are also five conditions to observe: soft murmurs and gentle words, associated with the heart; closed eyes, associated with the liver; dry throat and gasping, associated with the lungs; legs bending or stretching, lying back like the moon, associated with the spleen; and cold breath from the mouth and nose, with fluid dripping from the female organ, associated with the kidneys.

<p>During the union of husband and wife, there are three voids and four prohibitions that must be observed. The three voids refer to: the winter solstice when yang is born but true fire is dormant, and the summer solstice when yin is born but true water is still weak; this constitutes the void of the year; the first quarter before the full moon and the last quarter after the full moon, when the moon is empty; this constitutes the void of the month; the darkening of heaven and earth, the sun and moon; this constitutes the void of the day. When encountering these three voids, one must exercise caution and avoid them.</p>
<p>The four prohibitions are: firstly, to avoid the day of one’s own heavenly stem in direct conflict, such as the day of the winter solstice and the day of the summer solstice; secondly, to avoid times of extreme cold, extreme heat, excessive drunkenness, or overindulgence in food; thirdly, to avoid places associated with the sun, moon, stars, temples, altars, or graves; fourthly, to steer clear of actions that cause anger, curses, or violence. Violating these three voids and four prohibitions not only results in childlessness but can also lead to premature death.</p>
<p>The method of seeding mentioned here is documented in various texts; if one follows it, there are no failures. However, I have a different viewpoint. It is common for the common folk in the fields, along with licentious women, to give birth despite possibly being unaware of this seeding method. They wait for the heavenly essence to awaken and open the door to conception, coinciding with the mating seasons of birds and beasts. They wait for males to approach three times and females five times before they achieve their full potential; this is the principle of yin and yang harmonizing, so subtle that words cannot fully express it. Moreover, the common folk display straightforward emotions that easily connect, while licentious women, with their deep thoughts and engaging emotions, facilitate the harmony of yin and yang resulting in higher fertility.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Essence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When the cycle of the menstrual period is regular, men and women may unite. Within three days, one should enjoy the pleasures of the moment. The male yang and the female yin harmonize; when the yang sings, the yin responds. Dew drips from the autumn leaves, and jade-like grains can form; the spring wind blows through the peach blossoms, and golden scales leap naturally. The profound principles of heaven and earth are the foundation of life. Do not dismiss these words as mere idle talk fit for laughter.</p>
<p><strong>Seed Chapter</strong></p>
<p>For conception, the male must be robust and not diminished, while the female must be responsive and not averse; when yin and yang flow harmoniously, essence and blood unite, facilitating the formation of the fetus. Otherwise, if the yang is weak, it cannot align with the yin; if the yin is deficient, it cannot respond to the yang. Separation of yin and yang leads to childlessness. The essence of seed lies in a woman maintaining a calm heart and steady spirit. Indeed, as women serve others with their bodies, they often become anxious, desiring approval based on their beauty. At the slightest displeasure, they may feel worry, resentment, or anger. Worry binds the qi, thought causes stagnation, resentment obstructs qi, and anger raises it; blood flows with the qi, and if qi goes astray, the blood follows. Therefore, maintaining a calm heart and steady spirit is of utmost importance for women. As for medicinal remedies, they should take black chicken pills to nourish qi and blood and regulate their cycles, which is the correct approach. One must stay away from excessive remedies that deplete yang and consume blood, as these are detrimental. Childlessness in women is often due to menstrual irregularities; thus, support through medicine is especially critical and should not be delayed.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one does not regulate the menstrual cycle and align with it, but instead expends effort in unproductive areas, this regulation of the cycle is crucial for women’s fertility. Women inherently suffer from conditions of excess discharge; when their menstrual flow is irregular, they cannot conceive, which is referred to as a deficient lower source, unable to gather blood for fertilization. It is advisable to replenish this deficiency and restore balance using specific tonics like the Black Chicken Pill or the Guardian Pill.</p>
<p>The female reproductive quality is emblematic of the moon. If from the new moon to the full moon, the menstrual flow is consistent, conceiving is easy, and children often live long, as the moonlight gradually increases until full. However, if from the full moon to the new moon the menstrual flow fails to maintain its regularity, conception is difficult and many children face early death, mirroring the waning moonlight that diminishes and the moon&#39;s outline that becomes hollow. This is the principle of creation; can it be explained to the ignorant?</p>
<p>In general, for conception, at the right time, men should take tonics to nourish the kidneys and enhance essence, while women should regulate their diet, keeping flavors mild and avoiding extremes of heat and cold. At midnight, when life&#39;s energy is at its peak, follow the appropriate rhythms—three times going, five times coming, three times empty, and four times to be wary—and naturally, union will lead to pregnancy, and pregnancy will lead to successful births.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p>To have offspring in life, although it is said to be a heavenly decree, is it not also a matter of human affairs? There are men who cannot father children, and women who cannot conceive. For men who cannot father children, there are six ailments. For women who cannot conceive, there are ten ailments. What are the six ailments? One is cold essence, one is declining energy, one is excess phlegm, one is excessive fiery essence, one is insufficient essence, and one is blocked energy. Cold essence refers to the coldness in the essence of the kidneys; even if it is released into the womb, the woman&#39;s body cannot accept it, and it will not be a month before it miscarries. Declining energy refers to the weakening of yang energy; when energy is low, one cannot engage in prolonged effort to stir the woman&#39;s heart; if the man&#39;s essence has already been emitted while the woman&#39;s essence has not yet mingled, how can life be conceived?

If the essence is mixed, although conception may occur, the offspring is destined to perish. When the fire of vitality is strong and one endures prolonged battles, if the female essence has already passed while the male essence has yet to be released, and when the male essence is released but the female becomes quiescent, how can there be the prospect of reproduction? Stagnation of qi is due to the liver&#39;s energy being obstructed, unable to generate the heart’s warmth, leading to a harboring of worries, causing a lack of vigor in intimate matters. One may either have their joys extinguished or face sudden collapses; while women&#39;s springtime desires are strong, men&#39;s deep sighs arise. This results in desolate scenes, quiet rooms, an indelible longing for provisions, and scant laughter. How can one nurture jade in the blue fields or conceive a dragon in the fragrant chambers? Thus, for those with cold essence, warm their vitality; for those with weak qi, replenish their energy; for those with excessive phlegm, disperse it; for those with strong fire, nourish their water; for those with scant essence, augment their essence; and for those with stagnant qi, soothe their energy. This way, even men who feel powerless can still have offspring; merely supplementing the fire of vitality is not sufficient.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What are the ten diseases? One is cold in the womb, one is cold in the spleen and stomach, one is urgency in the dai vessel, one is stagnation of liver qi, one is excess of phlegm and qi, one is exuberance of fire, one is deficiency of kidney water, one is illness of the governor and conducive vessels, one is dysfunction in bladder qi transformation, and one is deficiency of qi and blood, unable to sustain life. The pulse of the womb is what receives substances; warmth allows for life, while cold leads to death. Even if a man&#39;s essence is hot and enters, how can it be retained without being expelled? If the spleen and stomach are weak and cold, then the dai vessel will naturally be powerless; if the essence enters the womb, how can it function properly? The dai vessel should be slow, not urgent. If the dai vessel is urgent, it is due to problems with the waist and navel. If there are problems with the waist and navel, the womb will be weak; how can it sustain anything? If liver qi is stagnant, the heart will be uncomfortable; how can there be joy in the marital bed? If phlegm and qi are excessive, it is likely due to obesity; regardless of body size, if the lower body is overly plump and the uterus is constricted, it will be difficult to conceive. Even if a man is very healthy, bravely fighting, and ejaculation occurs directly, if dampness arises from the bladder, there will surely be the risk of overflow.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those with excessive fire disturbance burn and dry out the land, making it difficult for plants to grow. When kidney water is deficient, the uterus becomes dry, and seedlings lack the nourishing rain, leading to wilting and inevitable sorrow. If there are signs of hernia or blockage between the Ren and Du channels, the essence cannot be released, as it is obstructed externally. The bladder is close to the womb; if the transformation of qi is inefficient, the dampness will inevitably seep into the womb, preventing conception. For a woman to conceive, she must have ample qi and blood; if qi is deficient, yang declines, and if blood is deficient, yin declines. When both qi and blood are insufficient, the womb will sink and cannot rise, leading to miscarriage. Therefore, if the womb is cold, it must be warmed; if the spleen and stomach are cold, they need to be warmed; if the Dai vessel is tight, it should be relaxed; if liver qi is stagnant, it must be opened; if phlegm and qi are excessive, they need to be resolved; if fire is excessive, it should be balanced; if kidney water is deficient, it must be supplemented; if there are issues with the Ren and Du channels, they must be addressed; if bladder qi transformation is not functioning, support the kidney qi; if qi and blood cannot nourish the fetus, bolster the qi and blood. Thus, even women who are barren may conceive, and one cannot merely treat the womb in isolation.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Black Chicken Pills</strong>: These treat women&#39;s spleen and stomach deficiency, damage to the Chong and Ren vessels, insufficient blood and energy, and menstrual irregularities leading to infertility, with proven efficacy. Take a black-feathered, male, fat black-bone chicken, and feed it glutinous rice for seven days without allowing it to eat insects or field animals.

<p>Change the bag once a day; it must be new. If done correctly, a clear yellow fluid will be discharged, and when it stops, intercourse can occur, leading to conception. If no symptoms are observed, it can be kept in place for up to ten days. This medicine is initially used to expel residual unhealthy substances from the uterus after using the Dangbao Decoction. The presence of cold residual substances in the uterus leads to infertility. In cold, damp weather, pain may occur; it is important to wait until the ailment subsides completely and not to discontinue prematurely. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dang Bao Tang (from &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot;)</strong></p>
<p>For women who have not conceived since their youth, and after a prolonged period of infertility, especially after thirty years, it is advisable to take this remedy.</p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Aconite (processed) 1.5 taels</li>
<li>Nitre (stone salt) </li>
<li>Angelica 3 taels</li>
<li>Rhubarb (steamed for a long time with rice)</li>
<li>Peony root 3 taels</li>
<li>Peach kernel (peeled and pointed) 3 taels</li>
<li>Magnolia bark with ginger juice, roasted</li>
<li>Achyranthes 2 taels</li>
<li>Platycodon 2 taels</li>
<li>Red peony 2 taels</li>
<li>Ginseng 2 taels</li>
<li>Poria 2 taels</li>
<li>Cinnamon heart 2 taels</li>
<li>Licorice (roasted) 2 taels</li>
<li>Aged tangerine peel 2 taels</li>
<li>Cattle tick (wings and legs removed, toasted until charred) 10 pieces</li>
<li>Leech (toasted and dried) 10 pieces</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation: Combine the seventeen ingredients with 5 sheng of clear wine and 6 sheng of water, boil down to one third, and divide into four doses. Take three times during the day and once at night, spacing each dose by three &quot;chen&quot; (about 6 hours). When taking, cover warmly; if little sweat appears, use a fire box in winter. This will eliminate stagnant blood and cool, red pus, similar to red bean juice. This is meant for women whose uterus contains such harmful substances, which may cause pain below the navel during damp weather or irregular menstrual flow due to cold blood preventing conception. If symptoms worsen, with weakness and severe distress, it is permissible to take more doses; however, two to three doses should suffice. If the distress is overwhelming, a mouthful of vinegar with cold liquid may be taken to stop it. Nevertheless, if the harmful substances are not fully expelled, the medicinal power will not be fully realized; enduring the full treatment is ideal. After one day, continue to sit and guide the medicine. An alternate recipe may include 2 taels of Asarum.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another method involves opening three inches from the Yinquan point and applying moxibustion based on age, three times.

The husband should be aware during the act of intercourse.</p>
<p>If a woman has no pregnancy, or if it has been a long time since giving birth without conceiving again, she can use a stick measuring fourteen inches in length. The woman should lie on her back, stretch her arms and legs out to measure the stick, dropping it straight down from the navel&#39;s center to the end of the stick, marking this point with ink. </p>
<p>Then, the stick should be bent horizontally, and the ends of the two sections should be placed at the marked point. Pressing there, one can feel the pulse respond. Each point should be treated with moxibustion three times, using moxa the size of a chopstick head, for significant effect.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A man named Dai was attending a drinking party in Qiao County when a soldier mentioned dismissing his wife. Dai inquired about the reason, to which the soldier replied: &quot;When I returned home as a bride, there was a chill in my heart, like a covered cup. When pressed, it sounded like water; when warmed by my hand, it felt like ice. It has been fifteen years since we married, and I fear that I may have no heirs, hence I wish to dismiss her.&quot; Dai said: &quot;Do not dismiss her; if you use my medicine, the illness can be cured, and you may achieve pregnancy.&quot; The soldier followed his advice. Dai diagnosed the soldier&#39;s pulse to be deep and slow, while the pulse at the wrist was strong and forceful, indicating that he was not without the potential for children. He could likely conceive within the year. First, he prescribed San Sheng San to induce vomiting of a bucket of phlegm and to soften the area of the heart. Next, he administered Baizhu Tiaozhong Decoction and Wuqin San; afterward, he mixed in Siwu Decoction. Within two months, the energies and blood harmonized, and after several months, he conceived a son. Dai often said: &quot;With this method, no woman is without children.&quot; This is truly not a falsehood.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: A friend’s wife, although her body is robust and well-proportioned, has, despite careful attention to her condition, never been able to conceive. So I instructed a servant to prepare a remedy for her, one that has not been recorded in ancient medical texts, but can certainly be discussed. There are five reasons why a mountain cannot be buried: if a child is blocked by a stone, even with a wise teacher, there is no way to apply the necessary measures; hence, a girl cannot conceive. As written in the medical texts, if one’s natural constitution is different, it cannot be changed by human effort, thus needing no further discussion. However, in cases where the natural constitution is not different but hindered by bodily issues, there are countless instances, both ancient and modern, of successful pregnancies. Yet, the foolishness of couples, the natural harmony that makes them compatible, even the most skilled cannot guarantee fertility, and thus the medical texts are lacking in this regard. I propose that the essence of the earth is inherently substantial, yet it relies on the influence of weather for vitality to persist. In areas of heavy cold and dampness, where sunlight fails to shine, life rarely thrives. The human body, rich in muscle and full of blood, is a beautiful thing; however, when blood is abundant, it can easily lead to a depletion of vital energy.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The interaction between qi and blood is intricate; how can one be weak or strong while the other is not? Qi is the master, thus blood flows; when blood is dominant, qi does not flow properly. When qi ceases to flow, it resembles a decline. Therefore, all medications that tonify qi should not be used, while those that drain qi might be beneficial, as nourishing qi could cause stagnation. It is better to reduce it to facilitate its movement, and over time, blood will return to its proper control.</p>
<p>When Duke Huayang became pregnant but could not give birth due to excessive body weight, a knowledgeable person prescribed a method harmful to the fetus, and after taking several doses, she was able to deliver smoothly, ensuring the safety of both mother and child. Due to her plump body, the fetus had no space, so the medications merely drained the external flesh and blood but could not exhaust the true essence within.</p>
<p>I formulated a prescription based on this understanding, preparing for the ideal conditions for conception. Is it not a skill to create? For a woman with a suitable partner, she must first calm her heart; a tranquil heart leads to harmonious qi, and harmonious qi is conducive to flowing and filling. Next, she should regulate her diet, maintaining a clean physique, often practicing fasting to achieve a slender waist in the womb, tolerating hunger and focusing her will to move qi; what can’t be accomplished with such effort?</p>
<p>Moreover, by aligning hearts and nurturing virtue, and through the teachings of spiritual paths, can even tonics fall short? I seek pearls in Hepu and find joy in cultivating jade in Lantian.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>
