      <div><p><strong>Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 242 – Cough Chapter</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic of Internal Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Cough</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes the lungs to induce coughing? Qi Bo replied: All five viscera and six bowels can cause coughing; it is not solely the lungs. The Emperor said: I wish to understand its characteristics. Qi Bo replied: The skin and hair are connected to the lungs. The skin and hair first encounter pathogenic influences, which can enter through this connection. When cold food and drink enter the stomach and ascend to the lungs through the lung meridian, it results in lung cold. When the lungs are cold, both external and internal pathogens can unite and cause symptoms, leading to coughing from the lungs. </p>
<p>The five viscera each suffer from disease at their respective times, and if it is not that time, they transfer influence to the lungs. </p>
<p>Human beings are interrelated with heaven and earth, so the five viscera are treated accordingly. When affected by cold at the right time, it results in disease; if mild, it may cause coughing, and if severe, it may lead to diarrhea or pain.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The qi of the five organs corresponds with the qi of the four seasons and the five phases. Therefore, if one experiences a slight illness, it first ascends to the lungs, resulting in a cough; if severe, it rises to the upper, causing a downward flow that leads to painful dysentery. </p>
<p>In autumn, the lungs are the first to be affected; in spring, the liver is first; in summer, the heart; during the extreme yin, the spleen; and in winter, the kidneys are first affected. </p>
<p>The term &quot;first affected&quot; refers to how it then transmits to the lungs, causing a cough. The cough is fundamentally a disease of the lungs; this is why the lungs are mentioned first as being affected. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What differentiates them?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The symptoms of lung cough are characterized by coughing with wheezing and sound, and in severe cases, spitting blood.&quot; </p>
<p>The lungs govern respiration; thus, a cough can produce sound from wheezing. The lungs manage qi; in severe cases, the qi may rise inversely, resulting in spitting blood. </p>
<p>For heart cough, the symptoms include coughing with heart pain, and the throat feeling blocked, resembling a lump; in severe cases, there is swelling of the throat and a sensation of obstruction. </p>
<p>The throat is associated with the lungs; the heart fire affects the metal phase, hence the throat feels blocked. The hand shao yin heart meridian originates in the heart, extends to connect with the heart system, and ascends to include the throat, thus resulting in swelling and pain in the throat.</p>
<p>For liver cough, the symptoms include pain below the ribs on both sides; in severe cases, one cannot turn, and turning leads to fullness beneath the ribs. </p>
<p>The liver meridian spreads through the rib area, which connects upward to the lungs; therefore, a cough leads to pain beneath the ribs. The inability to turn indicates an inability to bend or reach; this is because liver pathogenic influence ascends to the lungs, causing the cough, and if severe, it rebelliously obstructs below without allowing movement, leading to fullness beneath the ribs.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The symptoms of spleen-related cough manifest as pain under the right rib when coughing, with a pulling sensation towards the shoulder and back; in severe cases, movement becomes difficult, and coughing intensifies upon movement. </p>
<p>(Note: The spleen resides on the right side, hence the pain under the right rib when coughing. Spleen energy ascends to the lungs, and the lung&#39;s corresponding area is in the shoulder and back, causing the pulling sensation towards the shoulder and back. If the situation is mild, it affects the lungs leading to a cough; if severe, it impacts the primary channel.)</p>
<p>Symptoms of kidney-related cough cause pain that pulls the shoulder and back, and in severe cases produce phlegm when coughing.</p>
<p>(Note: The kidney channel passes through the diaphragm into the lungs, hence the pain when coughing relates to the lung&#39;s channel. Both lungs and kidneys may accumulate water, which leads to the production of phlegm in severe cases.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about the diseases of the six hollow organs? Where does the illness occur? Qi Bo replied: A long-standing cough in the five organs will transfer to the six hollow organs.</p>
<p>(Note: The illnesses of the six hollow organs shift based on the energy from the five organs.)</p>
<p>If the spleen&#39;s cough persists, it will affect the stomach. The symptoms of a stomach-related cough include coughing and vomiting; in severe cases, long worms may emerge.</p>
<p>(Note: The spleen and stomach are interconnected; if the spleen is ill, the disease transfers to the stomach, leading to the stomach&#39;s energy reversing and causing vomiting. If vomiting is severe, food energy is consumed, allowing worms to enter the stomach, thus leading to their emergence in severe cases.)</p>
<p>If the liver&#39;s cough continues, it will affect the gallbladder. Symptoms of a gallbladder-related cough include coughing and vomiting bile.</p>
<p>(Note: If the pathogenic factor is in the gallbladder, it causes reversal in the stomach, leading to bitter vomiting.)</p>
<p>If the lung&#39;s cough persists, it will affect the large intestine. Symptoms of a large intestine-related cough manifest as coughing and involuntary defecation.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The large intestine is a visceral organ of the lungs, serving as the channel for transmission. Thus, if it ascends, there will be coughing; if it descends, there will be incontinence. If the heart&#39;s cough persists, the small intestine will be affected. The small intestine coughs in a way that leads to a loss of qi, causing both qi and cough to be lost. If the qi of the extremities ascends, there will be coughing; if it descends, there will be incontinence. When both qi and cough are lost, it indicates that the qi is ascending and dispersing both upward and downward. If the kidney&#39;s cough persists, the bladder will be affected. The bladder coughs in a manner that leads to incontinence. The bladder is the organ of bodily fluids, responsible for the water pathway, hence the coughing leads to incontinence. If coughing continues for a long time, the three burners (San Jiao) will be affected. The three burners cough in a way that leads to abdominal fullness and a lack of desire for food and drink. The three burners are the organ of the middle passages, thus causing abdominal fullness. When coughing occurs, the upper burner cannot manage intake, resulting in a lack of desire for food and drink. All these conditions aggregate in the stomach, and relate to the lungs, causing excessive saliva and phlegm, with facial swelling and rebellious qi. When coughing occurs, the lungs elevate and fluids overflow, leading to an increase in saliva. Water and qi rising cause facial swelling and rebellious qi. The Emperor asked: How should this be treated? Qi Bo replied: To treat the organs, address their points; to treat the viscera, address their connections; and for swelling, treat the meridians. Coughing in the five organs should be treated at their points; coughing in the six viscera should be addressed at their connections; and for swelling, treat the meridians related to the lungs and stomach.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>The Great Discussion on the Changes of Qi</h3>
<p>In years when fire is excessive, summer heat prevails, leading to the dysfunction of the lungs associated with metal. As a result, the people suffer from fevers and experience symptoms of breathlessness and coughing. 【Note: In years governed by Wu, when fire is overly active, it overcomes metal. Therefore, the lungs are affected by heat, resulting in wheezing and coughing.】 </p>
<p>In years when metal is excessive, dry air prevails, harming the liver associated with wood. In severe cases, this leads to breathlessness and coughing with reversed qi, and in extreme cases, there is blood in the cough. 【Note: Wheezing and reversed qi are lung diseases. The liver meridian passes through the lungs, hence the severity of the cough. The liver governs blood storage, which explains the presence of blood.】 </p>
<p>In years when water is excessive, cold air prevails, harming the heart fire, leading to severe breathlessness and coughing. 【Note: In years governed by Bing, when water is overly active, it causes water qi to ascend, resulting in wheezing and coughing.】 </p>
<p>In years when wood is deficient, dryness becomes prevalent, leading again to summer heat and fire overpowering the lung metal, resulting in coughing and nasal conditions. 【Note: When the annual wood energy is insufficient, the dryness attributed to metal becomes rampant, and fire resurfaces because its mother is suppressed. In years with deficiencies, the opposing energies may run amok, leading to its own weakening. Therefore, the Qi of the lungs can gain supremacy. The lungs open to the nose, hence the coughing and nasal discharge.】<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>Essentials of the Ultimate Truth</h3>
<p>The Lesser Yin governs Heaven, where excessive heat prevails, causing the people to suffer from cold, heat, cough, and wheezing. In severe cases, the lungs are affected, leading to abdominal distention and difficulty in breathing and coughing. [Note: In the year of the Rat and Horse, the fire of Lesser Yin rises from within, thus the lungs suffer from fire and heat resulting in a lack of bodily fluids.] </p>
<p>The Lesser Yang governs Heaven, where excessive fire prevails, disrupting the balance of metal, causing the people to cough. [Note: The Lesser Yang governs Heaven during the years of the Tiger and Monkey. Due to the excess of fire, the balance of metal is disrupted, resulting in coughing.]</p>
<p>The Yangming governs Heaven, where excessive dryness prevails, causing the people to cough.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>&quot;Annotation: The Yangming is victorious; it is the year of Mao and You. The dry metal dominates above, hence the great coolness transforms the pulse, resulting in cough. Yangming&#39;s triumph arises from within, causing throat blockage and cough.</p>
<p>Annotation: The cold and austere metal energy emerges from within; the blockage and cough occur because the Yangming dry metal ascends to the lungs, creating a mutual resonance of energies. The Emperor asked: How does the recovery of the six energies manifest? Qibo replied: The recovery of the Shaoyin involves internal heat production, energy moving to the left, ascending to the right, resulting in cough and skin pain.</p>
<p>Annotation: The energy moving to the left indicates that the fire energy emanates from the water of the left kidney. Ascending to the right means that the lungs and kidneys intersect vertically, with the kidneys being the source and the lungs the endpoint. When the fire overtakes the lung&#39;s metal, coughing and skin pain arise. The recovery of the Taiyin involves transformation due to dampness, leading to internal fluid production, resulting in coughing and wheezing sounds.</p>
<p>Annotation: When the energy reaches an extreme, the transformation to cough and wheeze, accompanied by sound, indicates that fluids have invaded the lungs. The recovery of the Shaoyang involves cough with nasal bleeding; in severe cases, blood may be coughed up and discharged.&quot;<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>The fire of Shaoyang reappears in the autumn and winter, which is why heat invades the heart and lungs, causing coughs. In severe cases, it enters the lungs, resulting in coughing up blood, harming both qi and blood.</p>
<p>The revival of Yangming brings forth abundant clear qi, leading to bitter vomiting, coughing, and irritability, with the illness located in the diaphragm. The revival of Yangming occurs during the time dictated by its fundamental position, which is why clear qi blooms. Coughing and irritability indicate that the lung qi is rebellious, with the illness in the diaphragm and the qi of Yangming rising inversely.</p>
<p>The manifestations of Yangming and Taiyang retaliate against the air from six months prior, which causes disturbances in wood, fire, and earth, leading to ailments across all. </p>
<p>When Jueyin is in charge of heaven, excessive victorious influences can result in tinnitus, dizziness, and in severe cases, coughing. The overpowering wind and wood energies can lead to such coughing, as the excessive and indulgent qi penetrates the channels.</p>
<p>When Shaoyin governs heaven, if overwhelming influences arise, it can lead to severe coughing and wheezing.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>【Note: Lesser Yin governs the heavens, and the essence of three corresponds to the fire of Lesser Yin. When coughing and wheezing occur, it indicates the predominance of the sovereign fire. The sovereign fire governs the year, hence its superiority over the fire, and if excessive, it affects Lesser Yin.】 Lesser Yang governs the heavens; when it is predominant, there is fullness in the chest, coughing, and difficulty in breathing, which may escalate to blood in the sputum, and the hands feel hot. 【Note: Lesser Yang governs the heavens and the initial essence of the three energies, representing the fire of the sovereign and the minister. When predominant, the fullness in the chest and difficulty in breathing arise from this fire, desiring to ascend and emerge externally.】 Greater Yang governs the heavens; when the guest is dominant, there is hinderance in the chest, causing bizarre coughing. 【Note: The energy of Greater Yang resides externally; the lungs govern the skin and hair, thus the hinderance in the chest leads to a runny nose and coughing. The phrase &quot;being affected by cold&quot; refers to the distinction between Greater Yang and cold water.】 Greater Intestine governs the heavens; when the internal excess of clarity recurs, it results in coughing, nasal bleeding, and constriction in the throat. When heat resides in the heart and diaphragm, unceasing coughing and spitting blood may lead to death. 【Note: The internal excess of clarity refers to the guest energy of clarity that enters and accumulates within. Coughing, nasal bleeding, and constriction in the throat, along with heat in the heart and diaphragm, indicate lung disease. If white blood emerges from the lungs, it aligns with Greater Intestine governing the heavens—an essence belonging to the heavens where the organs belong to Yin but blood is Yin; thus if blood issues from the lungs, it signifies a predominance of Yang and an exhaustion of Yin.】<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Great Treatise on the Six Principles</p>
<p>When golden clouds gather, the people suffer from coughs and reversals.<br>[Note: &quot;Cough and reversal&quot; refers to lung ailments.]<br>The governance of the Lesser Yang controls the heavens, as the vital energy transforms and operates from the original state. At the beginning, cold departs, and great warmth arrives. In these cases, the pathogenic energy accumulates above, causing blood to overflow and the eyes to turn red, leading to coughs and headaches.<br>[Note: The initial state involves the Fire of the Lesser Yin; symptoms like blood overflowing, red eyes, and coughs are all manifestations of wind and fire as illnesses.]<br>In the second state, the heat reverses and accumulates; the illness is characterized by heat accumulating above, resulting in coughs and vomiting.<br>[Note: The second external pathogenic energy pertains to the Greater Yin&#39;s moist earth, leading to symptoms such as heat accumulation and vomiting due to external dampness condensing while internal heat is retained.]<br>In the third state, with the arrival of scorching summer heat, the people suffer from coughs and vomiting.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The notes explain that the qi from the heavens influences the three types of qi, contributing to ailments like coughing and vomiting due to exposure to wind and fire. The governance of the Lesser Yin is concerned with the qi transformation that occurs pre-naturally, resulting in people&#39;s ailments of cough and wheeze. The notes clarify that coughing and wheezing arise from heat diseases originating in the upper body.</p>
<p>When the qi of the terminal phase becomes dry, it leads to movement, causing residual fire to become concentrated, resulting in swelling and causing cough and wheeze. The notes explain that the terminating qi is governed by the Yangming, which oversees the dry and metallic transformation, thus causing dryness to lead to movement, heat accumulating from the interaction, and consequently leading to cough and wheeze. The governance of Yangming pertains to the post-natal qi transformation, leading to people&#39;s ailments of throat obstruction and cough. The notes mention that throat obstruction results from being affected by dry and damp qi, leading to sickness.</p>
<p>In separate discussions on Yin and Yang, it is noted that when the Yang is affected, it leads to a lack of vitality, prone to coughing and diarrhea. The notes explain that this Yang corresponds to the Lesser Yang qi. When in illness, the qi becomes insufficient while the fire becomes strong, leading to metallic burning, thus promoting coughing.</p>
<p>In relation to menstrual regulation, excess qi results in coughing and wheezing movements upward. The notes indicate that the lungs govern qi and breathing, so an excess leads to upward disturbances like coughing and wheezing.</p>
<p>As for syncope discussions, the hand Taiyin experiences reversal, resulting in a feeling of fullness and coughing. The notes clarify that the lungs govern qi, which can cause a feeling of emptiness and fullness due to reverse flow resulting in coughing. Furthermore, Yangming reverse flow leads to wheezing and coughing.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Notes</strong>: When Yangming qi is obstructed, it leads to wheezing; when it is counterflowing, it leads to coughing.<br><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Coughing and wheezing occur when obstruction is in the chest, involving the hand Yangming and Taiyin. <strong>Note</strong>: When pathogens harm the skin, hair, and qi layer, it leads to coughing and upward-reversal of qi. The pathway of the hand Taiyin begins in the middle burner, circulating up to the diaphragm, while the pathway of the hand Yangming enters the chest cavity and connects to the lungs below the diaphragm, belonging to the large intestine. When the pathogen overwhelms the meridian, the stomach experiences counterflow.<br><strong>On the Communication of Vital Energy to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>In autumn, when attacked by dampness, there is upward-reversal and coughing, leading to weakness and counterflow. <strong>Note</strong>: In cases of Yin disease, the energy descends to extremes and then ascends, hence in autumn, being injured by dampness causes upward-reversal and coughing.<br><strong>On Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In Lesser Yin, what is termed vomiting, coughing, and wheezing occurs because yin qi is below and yang qi is above. When all yang qi is floating without support, it results in vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. <strong>Note</strong>: The cold water of Lesser Yin is below, while the fire qi of the monarch is above. When water and fire do not interact, all yang qi rises without support, causing the upward-reversal of yang heat, resulting in the disease of vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. In Lesser Yang, when coughing is accompanied by blood, it indicates damage to the yang vessels. When yang qi has not yet fully flourished above but the pulse is full, fullness leads to coughing, causing blood to appear in the nose. <strong>Note</strong>: When yang qi is not yet flourishing above, it indicates that by the ninth month, Lesser Yang begins to flourish. Blood flows with qi, and when qi is not yet flourishing but the pulse is already full, the blood accumulates and reverses.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>On the Transmission of Disease Related to Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>Lung diseases characterized by wheezing and coughing lead to fullness and pain in the sides after three days; a feeling of heaviness and body pain after one day; bloating after five days; and if it does not resolve after ten days, death occurs. In winter, symptoms appear with the onset of cold, and in summer, they manifest as heat. </p>
<p><em>Note: The onset of symptoms corresponds to the energy of the sun—rising in the morning brings forth vitality, while setting in the evening draws it back. The lungs govern this vital energy, thus reflecting this cycle of inhalation and exhalation.</em></p>
<p>Heart disease initially presents as heart pain, followed by coughing after one day; pain in the sides after three days; obstruction and accumulation after five days, with body pain and heaviness, and if it persists for three days, death follows. In winter, this occurs during midnight; in summer, during noon. </p>
<p><em>Note: The heart is associated with fire. Midnight in winter indicates dominance of water, extinguishing the fire. Noon in summer indicates excessive fire, leading to self-immolation.</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Regulation of the Five Elements</strong></p>
<p>When metal is insufficient, it is said to give rise to transformation. When the conditions for transformation occur, symptoms include coughing and wheezing, affecting the lungs, presenting as sneezing, coughing, nasal discharge, and bleeding. </p>
<p><em>Note: Coughing and wheezing are manifestations of the lungs being harmed by fire. Sneezing, coughing, nasal discharge, and bleeding are diseases of metal.</em></p>
<p>When metal is excessive, it is described as solidification and formation. During conditions of solidification and formation, coughing becomes a prevalent symptom. </p>
<p><em>Note: Coughing in this context signifies damage to the lungs by fire.</em></p>
<p>When the lesser yang governs the heavens, fire energy descends, while lung energy rises, resulting in coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal obstruction. </p>
<p><em>Note: The upward movement is due to the descending atmospheric energy, feared to be overpowering, thus causing a follow-through response. Coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and obstruction all indicate lung disease.</em><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>The autumn&#39;s Geng and Xin energies are disrupted by external evils, resulting in &quot;Lung Wind.&quot; The symptoms of Lung Wind include excessive sweating and aversion to wind, presenting a pale and ashen complexion. There may be shortness of breath and cough that is intermittent, worse in the evening than during the day. The area above the eyebrows is examined, showing a pale color.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wind is a Yang evil that opens the pores, which leads to excessive sweating. Wind harms Yang, causing a mismatch between the evil and the proper energies, hence the aversion to wind. The lung is associated with metal and has a white color. The lung governs Qi and can lead to coughing due to movement; when pressured by wind evil, this leads to shortness of breath. During the day, Yang energy is stronger and can overcome the evil, resulting in less severity; in the evening, the energy weakens, thus the illness worsens. The area above the eyebrows is a point for examining lung conditions.</p>
<h3>Essential Diagnostics Conclusion</h3>
<p>Spring acupuncture during the Autumn Equinox leads to muscle spasms and reverse Qi, which manifests as coughing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The organs are fundamentally superior to the lungs, governing the regulation and nourishment of Yin and Yang. The nourishing and protecting Qi and blood help to moisten the muscles and bones and benefit the joints. If the liver is diseased and in turn injures the lung, this causes the muscles to spasm and the Qi to move in reverse, hence leading to an upward reversal of Qi that results in coughing.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the True Organs of Jade Mechanism</h3>
<p>When the autumn pulse is insufficient, it leads to wheezing, shallow breathing, and coughing, with blood seen in the upper airways and pathological sounds noted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lungs govern the Qi of the entire body; when Qi is insufficient, it causes breathlessness and wheezing, with shallow breathing leading to cough. If Qi is insufficient and reverses upwards, then blood also moves upwards.

<p><strong>On the Discussion of Heat Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>For illnesses of the kidney and wind, if the condition is weak, one should not apply acupuncture. If acupuncture is applied despite the weakness, after five days the patient&#39;s qi will surely manifest. When it manifests, there will be a sensation of heat accompanied by shortness of breath, heat rising from the chest and back to the head, sweating with hot hands, dry mouth and bitter thirst, yellowish urine, swelling below the eyes, rumbling in the abdomen, heavy body and difficulty in movement, missed menstruation, irritability, inability to eat, and trouble lying flat. Lying flat induces coughing, which is known as wind-water. The true qi ascends in rebellion, hence the bitter mouth and dry tongue. One cannot lie flat, as it leads to coughing up clear water. Those with water-related illnesses cannot lie down, as it causes fright, and fright exacerbates coughing.<br>(Note: The term &quot;wind-water&quot; is used here because wind provokes the movement of water. True qi refers to the vital essence from the heart of the organs. The heart belongs to fire and is adverse to water&#39;s evils; thus, when water qi rises, it forces the heart&#39;s qi to rebel, resulting in a bitter mouth and dry tongue. The kidney is the root, while the lung is the final aspect; both the metal and water organs are filled with moisture. Therefore, when water qi rises in the lung, it leads to coughing out clear water. Water evils invade the stomach, preventing one from lying down. The stomach meridian connects to the heart; when yang qi enters yin, yin and yang become imbalanced, causing fright and anxiety. The heart&#39;s qi overreaches into the lung, as metal fears fire and heat, thus exacerbating the cough.)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Discourse on Bi Syndrome</strong></p>

<p>Cough</p>
<p>If one obtains the lung pulse, the external signs are a pale face, frequent sneezing, deep sadness, being unhappy, and the desire to cry. The internal signs include movement in the area to the right of the navel, pressing here feels firm like pain. If one experiences coughing, wheezing, chills, and fever, it is indeed a lung issue; if not, it is not.</p>
<p>How can it be known that this is caused by a cold? Indeed. When one speaks irrationally, how can this be said? The lungs govern sound; entering the liver produces breathing, entering the heart leads to speech, entering the spleen results in singing, entering the kidneys causes groaning, and when inside oneself, it leads to weeping. Therefore, it is known that lung pathology entering the heart results in irrational speech.</p>
<p>The illness consists of fever with chills, possibly leading to coughing and wheezing, with a pulse that is floating and strong but thin. The accumulation in the lungs is called &quot;Xi Bi,&quot; located beneath the right rib, large like a cup. If it persists for a long time, it causes chills and fever, coughing and wheezing, generating lung stagnation, which is obtained on the days of the spring甲乙. How can this be said? Heart illness transfers to the lungs, the lungs should transfer to the liver. The liver is suited to spring; if the sovereign does not receive evil, the lungs wish to return to the heart, but the heart is unwilling to accept, thus leaving a blockage as accumulation. Therefore, it is known that &quot;Xi Bi&quot; is obtained on the days of spring甲乙.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Coughing due to Mixed Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When heat resides in the upper jiao, coughing leads to lung wasting. If the pulse at the inch is rapid, and the person coughs with turbid phlegm in the mouth, this indicates lung wasting. </p>
<p>A question arises: if the cough is severe, how can we tell if it is a lung abscess? It should involve pus and blood; if summoned up, the person will die. What is the pulse type? The master said: the pulse at the inch is fine and rapid; fine means wind, rapid means heat. A fine pulse indicates sweating, while a rapid one indicates aversion to cold. Wind is associated with the defensive qi; when the breath does not enter, heat overwhelms the nutritive qi; when inhaled, it does not come out. Wind harms the skin and hair, heat injures the blood vessels. If wind resides in the lungs, the person will cough, experience dry mouth, wheezing, swollen throat without thirst, and much turbid phlegm, along with chills at times. The heat causes blood stagnation, accumulating into pus and abscesses that can be vomited like rice porridge—if emerging early, it can be saved; if the pus has formed, it is fatal. </p>
<p>For coughing with dyspnea and a watery chicken-like sound in the throat, use the Decoction of Rhubarb and Ephedra. For cough and dyspnea with continual turbid spitting, but unable to sleep while sitting, use the Soap Tree Pill. For coughing with a floating pulse, use the Decoction of Thick Pericarp and Ephedra.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Coughing with a feeling of fullness in the chest, a rapid pulse accompanied by chills, dryness in the throat without thirst, and occasionally producing foul-smelling phlegm resembling rice porridge, indicates lung abscess; marshmallow decoction is the main treatment for this. </p>
<p>For lung distension with cough and dyspnea, accompanied by irritability and wheezing, along with a floating pulse, indicating water retention in the chest, the Xiao Qing Long Decoction with gypsum is the main treatment. </p>
<p>In cases of chest obstruction, symptoms include wheezing, coughing up phlegm, pain in the chest and back, shortness of breath, and a pulse that is deep and slow, with tight and rapid pulse at the wrist; the combination of loquat, scallion, and white wine decoction is the main treatment. </p>
<p>Coughing with difficulty lying down and presenting like swelling is referred to as &quot;supporting fluid.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is retained fluid, there will be pain under the ribs radiating to the lower abdomen, and coughing may cease suddenly. </p>
<p>In cases where phlegm accumulates above the diaphragm, symptoms of fullness, wheezing, coughing up phlegm are present, with alternating chills and fever, back pain, and tears flowing from the eyes; such a person may shake and tremble, indicating hidden fluid retention. </p>
<p>If the pulse is wiry in cases of cough, this indicates the presence of water; the Ten Jujube Decoction is the main treatment for this condition.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If someone has a condition characterized by phlegm and coughing, and experiences chest pain, they may not die for up to a hundred days or even a year; for this, Ten Jujube Soup is appropriate. If the cough has lasted for several years and the pulse is weak, treatment is possible; however, if the pulse is strong, the person is likely to die. Those with a weak pulse will surely suffer from discomfort, as they inherently have phlegm in their chest, and treatment should focus on the phlegm condition.</p>
<p>For a cough that worsens with breathing, preventing lying down, Xiao Qing Long Soup is the main remedy. If this soup is taken and leads to excessive salivation and a dry mouth, with a pulse that is deep at the cun and weak at the chi positions, and symptoms like cold extremities, gas rising from the lower abdomen to the chest and throat, numbness in hands and feet, and a flushed face resembling drunkenness, along with recurrent urinary difficulty, and occasional discomfort, then a combination of Fu Ling, Gui Zhi, Wu Wei Zi, and Gan Cao Soup should be used to address the ascending gas.</p>
<p>If the ascending gas subsides but the cough persists, leading to fullness in the chest, then Gui Ling Wu Wei Zi Gan Cao Soup should be used, replacing Gui with dried ginger and Xi Xin to treat the chest fullness. If the fullness of the cough stops but thirst increases and the ascending gas reappears, this indicates that Xi Xin and dried ginger are acting as heat-inducing medicines.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If one takes a remedy and is still thirsty, but the thirst subsides, this is known as &quot;supportive drink.&quot; Supportive drink requires an adventure, and one who has an adventure will certainly vomit. After vomiting, one should take Pinellia to eliminate the residual fluids.</p>
<p>If the pulse at the inch (cun) position is deep and slippery, it indicates the presence of water Qi, and the face is swollen and warm, this is called &quot;wind edema.&quot; If one observes the eyes slightly puffy, resembling a silkworm newly awakened, and if the neck pulse beats strongly, with frequent coughing, and if pressing the hands and feet leaves them sunken and non-rebounding, that is wind edema.</p>
<p>In the case of a Taiyang disease, the pulse is floating and tight, with pain in the joints, coughing, and shortness of breath without thirst, this signifies spleen distension, appearing like swelling. Sweating will lead to recovery. However, in all cases where there is thirst and diarrhea, and frequent urination, one must not induce sweating.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>A patient suffers from water retention, with swelling in the face, limbs, and body. Urination is not smooth; when the pulse is examined, water is not mentioned, but chest pain is reported, with qi rising to the throat, resembling the condition of roasted meat. The patient tends to have a slight cough and wheezing. As the teacher said, what type of pulse is this? The teacher responded: The pulse at the inch position is deep and tight. Deep indicates water, tight indicates cold; deep and tight clash, resulting in a blockage at the lower abdomen. Initially, the condition is slight but can go unnoticed in the young and vigorous. After the decline of yang, the defensive and nutritive energies become disturbed, with yang diminished and yin dominant. A slight cold blockage occurs, and kidney qi rises, causing a constriction in the throat and urgent pain below the ribs. The physician thinks that retaining fluid and treating with drastic purging will alleviate the condition, but as the qi doesn&#39;t disperse, the illness persists. Afterward, inducing severe vomiting causes stomach emptiness and distress, dryness in the throat craving water, poor urination, and undigested food leading to swelling in the face, hands, and feet. They also administered Ting Li Wan to remove water; at that time, the patient seemed to improve slightly, but overindulgence in food and drink caused the swelling to return as before, accompanied by painful pressure in the chest and ribs that felt like a runaway dolphin. If water rises and spills over, it leads to cough, wheezing, and reverse qi. The first step is to attack the defensive qi to stop the condition, then treat the cough; once the cough resolves, the wheezing will naturally improve. It is essential to treat the new illness first; the other illness will follow. </p>
<p>In the case of coughing up blood, reversed qi, and difficulty breathing, the pulse is rapid with signs of heat, leading to an inability to lie down, which results in death. For those who cough due to excessive drinking, this must lead to coughing up blood, a result of extreme overindulgence.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Zhong Cang Jing by Hua Tuo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Deficiency and Excess of the Organs Regarding Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is ill, it first manifests as heart pain and incessant coughing. If the diaphragm is obstructed, the body feels heavy and this persists for three days, leading to death. The small intestine is the receptacle organ; when one coughs, the qi expels simultaneously. The pulse in the lungs comes weakly; if it does not reach adequately, it causes wheezing and coughing, with blood appearing in sputum and the presence of disease sounds below. If there is deficiency, cold arises, leading to cough, difficulty in breathing, exhaustion, and excessive sadness. Furthermore, if lung illness persists with coughing leading to blood, bodies feel hot and breathing is short, the pulse should be thin. If the pulse is instead floating and large, and the color appears red instead of white, it indicates fire overpowering metal, which is ten times more fatal and untreatable. In lung illnesses with wheezing and coughing, if the body is cold without heat, and the pulse is slow and weak, treatment is possible. If there is deficiency, one cannot breathe properly; the ears feel heavy, throat is dry, and there is wheezing and coughing with difficulty breathing, along with shoulder and back pain. If there is coughing with involuntary urination, it is due to the upper deficiency failing to control the lower. When drinking alcohol in a draft, if it affects the lungs, it leads to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. If there is blood, it is untreatable; if no blood is present, treatment is possible.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>If a person&#39;s voice is usually clear and strong yet suddenly becomes quiet and strained, making it hard for them to speak and keeping them fixed in place, although they are not yet ill, their time is limited. For lung diseases, high and rapid breathing accompanied by a cough, along with a warm body and strong pulse indicates illness; if it&#39;s weak, they feel fatigued with shortness of breath, swelling in the right side, and speak in short gasps. </p>
<p>For kidney issues, symptoms include abdominal swelling, leg edema, coughing, a heavy body, and sweating at night with a dislike for wind. Additionally, a sound in the throat while sitting, accompanied by coughing and spitting of blood, indicates a deficiency in the kidney with cold, leading to a desire for breathlessness. </p>
<p>The bladder is an organ for fluids. If there is persistent coughing from the bladder, it affects the three burners, leading to a full abdomen and a lack of appetite. </p>
<p>If the middle burner is hot and solid, there is an obstruction, causing belly bloating and breathlessness, with gas rising and sinking blocked, resulting in stagnation. </p>
<p>Sudden coughing with a rapid pulse and a thin body indicates death. Sudden coughing with a scattered pulse indicates death. Sudden coughing with an obese frame and a very rapid pulse indicates death. Coughing with nausea and uncontrollable bowels, along with a thin yet almost absent pulse, indicates death. For all illnesses involving coughing and breathlessness, if the pulse is both sinking and floating, it indicates death. A cough with a hard sinking pulse indicates death.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Classic</strong> <em>(by Wang Shuhe from the Jin dynasty)</em></p>
<p><strong>Cough Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse at the right wrist&#39;s inch position is strong and full, this indicates a fullness in the Yangming large intestine channel. The patient suffers from abdominal fullness, is prone to wheezing and coughing, has a red face, body heat, and a feeling in the throat as if there is a lump. </p>
<p>In cases of sweating, vomiting, cold in the lungs, coughing due to drinking cold water, and diarrhea with a weak and cold stomach, the pulse will be tight. A floating, short pulse indicates lung injury; the person may not survive for more than a year, and the patient is likely to cough.</p>
<p>If the cough pulse is deep and tight, the prognosis is death; if it is floating and straight, there is hope for survival; if it is floating and soft, there is hope for recovery; if it is slightly hidden and sinking, the prognosis is death. </p>
<p>In cases of a cough coupled with emaciation, a pulse that is firm and large indicates death. If the cough leads to emaciation and heat persists without subsiding, the prognosis is death.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong><br><em>by Wang Shuhe (Jin Dynasty)</em>  </p>

<p><strong>Prescriptions of a Thousand Gold</strong><br><em>by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Cough</strong>  </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;All five organs and six bowels can cause coughing.&quot; The lungs are externally situated, close to the upper parts, and associated with the skin and hair, which easily receive pathogens; thus, the lungs are particularly prone to cough. When pathogens invade the lungs, symptoms include chills, heat, wheezing, sweating, coughing affecting the shoulders and back, and wheezing noises; in severe cases, it leads to coughing up blood. </p>
<p>If lung cough persists, it transmits to the large intestine; the cough&#39;s manifestation will then involve incontinence of feces. Kidney cough manifests as pain in the lower back, and in severe instances, involves coughing up phlegm. If kidney cough persists, it transmits to the bladder; the manifestation will then involve incontinence of urine. </p>
<p>Liver cough presents as pain in the left side of the ribs, and in severe cases, the patient cannot turn over. If liver cough persists, it transmits to the gallbladder; the cough will lead to the discharge of bitter clear fluid. </p>
<p>Heart cough manifests as heart pain, a sensation of obstruction in the throat, and in severe cases, can lead to throat paralysis or swelling. If heart cough persists, it transmits to the small intestine; the manifestation will then involve loss of breath. </p>
<p>Spleen cough manifests as pain in the right side of the ribs, accompanied by a pulling sensation in the shoulders and back, and in severe cases, the patient cannot move; movement leads to severe coughing. If it continues for a long time, it transmits to the stomach; the manifestation will then involve coughing and vomiting; in severe cases, it can lead to expulsion of long worms.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>A persistent cough that does not cease affects the Triple Burner. The symptoms of a cough associated with the Triple Burner include coughing with a sensation of fullness in the abdomen, inability to eat or drink. All of this accumulates in the stomach and relates to the lungs, causing excessive phlegm and facial swelling along with upward-contrary qi. When there is cold wind, and one is exposed to it, it injures the skin, penetrating into the internal organs, resulting in the above cough and shortness of breath. Sudden exposure to inappropriate cold harms the skin; if it combines with the lungs, it leads to coughing and shortness of breath, or pain in the chest and sides. If coughing up blood-streaked phlegm occurs, it indicates that heat has been affected by untimely cold, becoming violently concentrated and unable to disperse gradually, leading to deep-seated stagnation, likely indicating lung abscess. Coughing with warm medications may worsen the cough, and when accompanied by severe heat with purulent blood, sweating and aversion to cold will be present. When there are untimely cold instances, one must observe the four seasons closely.</p>
<p>When asked about the ten kinds of cough, the teacher replied: There is windy cough, cold cough, phlegm cough, liver cough, heart cough, spleen cough, lung cough, kidney cough, gallbladder cough, and Jueyin cough. When asked about the differences in the symptoms of these ten coughs, the teacher said: When one coughs while wanting to speak but cannot complete the thought, it is called windy cough. If one coughs due to drinking cold fluids or eating cold food, it is termed cold cough. A feeling of hardness and fullness below the heart, along with cough-related pain in the sides, with a pulse that is slow, is referred to as phlegm cough.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Coughing that leads to pain below the ribs is called liver cough. Coughing with blood in the phlegm, referring to the little yin hand, is called heart cough. Coughing that produces saliva continuously and leads to the lower abdomen is called spleen cough. Coughing that pulls at the neck and expels saliva and foam is called lung cough. Coughing that causes the ears to hear nothing and affects the waist and navel is called kidney cough. Coughing that leads to headache and bitter mouth is called gallbladder cough. Coughing that affects the base of the tongue is called jueyin cough. A cough caused by wind should not be treated with purgatives. Coughs due to cold, phlegm, or liver issues should be treated by needling foot Tai Chong. Heart cough should be treated by needling hand Shen Men. Spleen cough involves needling foot Tai Bai. Lung cough is treated by needling hand Tai Quan. Kidney cough requires needling foot Tai Xi. Gallbladder cough is treated by needling foot Yang Ling Quan. Jueyin cough is treated by needling hand Tai Ling. </p>
<p>Prolonged coughing with phlegm can indicate &quot;internal dampness.&quot; If coughing intermittently presents with fever and the pulse feels like &quot;string on a bamboo,&quot; it is not a deficiency but rather caused by cold-dampness in the chest, which should be expelled. </p>
<p>For those who cough consistently and have a wiry pulse, it is important to consider their strength and weakness before administering expectorants, and it is advisable to do so only when there is no fever.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Coughing is associated with the pulse indicating water; it can be treated with a decoction of ten dates. If one cannot find rest due to coughing, this is because the yin is unable to resist pathogens. Those who cough and cannot lie down will have pain radiating up along the neck. Their cough resembles that of a child with whooping cough. For those who consume alcohol and cough, they will surely vomit blood; this results from prolonged sitting and excessive drinking. If the pulse is deep, one should not induce sweating. In cases of chronic cough over several years, if the pulse is weak, it can be treated; if it is excessively strong, it leads to death. A weak pulse suggests that the condition may readily worsen; it indicates that there is fluid retained in the chest, thus belonging to someone with fluid issues. Sweating emerges with difficulty breathing, implying fluid issues. A cough accompanied by frequent urination, akin to loss of control, should not be treated with sweating, as sweating could induce cold chills or fainting. </p>
<p>For illnesses characterized by vomiting blood, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, with a rapid pulse indicating heat, those unable to lie down may face death. In cases of coughing and difficulty breathing with a rapid pulse, death follows, as the person&#39;s condition has deteriorated. A large, scattered pulse indicates a state of robust qi but deficient blood, referred to as having a superficial condition without a deep one. Difficulty breathing and facial swelling with a floating, large pulse is untreatable and often worsens with dysentery. When one experiences restless breathing and wheezing, this indicates lung swelling and a potential for fluid retention; inducing sweating can lead to healing. </p>
<p>In general, when dealing with breathing issues, many have found relief through the use of emetic herbs or acupuncture, which is important to deeply understand.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>The Book of Living Beings</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Gong, Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing due to cold damage has two patterns: one is the Taiyang pattern with cough, treated with Xiao Qing Long and Xiao Chai Hu. The other is the Shaoyin pattern with cough, treated with Zhen Wu Decoction, Si Ni San, and Zhu Ling Decoction. Generally, if heat is in the upper jiao, the person must drink water. If water accumulates below the heart, the lung becomes floating; the lung governs cough, and the water vapor rides on it, causing a cough with slight wheezing. Zhang Zhongjing states: if the cold damage does not resolve at the surface, and there is water vapor below the heart, leading to dry retching, fever, and cough, Xiao Qing Long Decoction is the primary treatment. If urination is not smooth and there is fullness in the lower abdomen, remove Ma Huang and add Fu Ling. For alternating chills and fever, fullness and pain in the chest and sides, or cough, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is the primary treatment; remove Ren Shen and Da Zao, adding Wu Wei Zi and Gan Jiang. If it is the Shaoyin pattern with cough, heaviness and pain in the four limbs, poor urination, and diarrhea with cough, Zhen Wu Decoction is the primary treatment; add Wu Wei Zi and Gan Jiang. In general, the water vapor from cold damage arises from excessive water consumption. The ancients treated coughing from water vapor: if the problem is in Yang, then Xiao Qing Long Decoction is used; if in Yin, then Zhen Wu Decoction is used. For cold extremities, abdominal pain, or diarrhea with cough, Si Ni San is the main treatment; add Wu Wei Zi and Gan Jiang. If diarrhea persists for six to seven days, with cough, dry thirst, agitation, and inability to sleep, Zhu Ling Decoction is the prime remedy.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Coughing Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Coughing refers to the presence of sound without phlegm, indicating that the lung qi is injured and not clear. &#39;Sough&#39; refers to having phlegm without sound, resulting from dampness in the spleen that produces phlegm. Coughing entails having phlegm and producing sound, which stems from lung qi injury and the movement of spleen dampness, leading to both cough and sough. Spleen dampness occurs when one is injured by humidity in autumn, causing accumulation in the spleen. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if there’s injury from dampness in autumn, one is bound to cough in winter. Generally, the nature of autumn is meant to be clear, but if this is disturbed, the qi will counteract and result in coughing, and if severe, it can excite spleen dampness and produce phlegm. Thus, it is understood that the spleen cannot retain dampness; though the lung qi is injured, it won&#39;t produce phlegm. Phlegm has less cold and more heat. Hence, coughing is not solely a disease of the lungs, as the lungs govern the skin and are responsible for external factors, thus wind and cold can first injure them. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all the five organs and six bowels can lead to coughing; it is not the sole domain of the lungs, as they each govern their respective times and can be affected by illness. The conditions vary; cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire—each can cause coughing. Only when dampness leads to phlegm drinks entering the stomach, lingering without movement, and solely entering the lungs does it result in coughing. For instance, dampness in the heart channel is called heat phlegm, in the liver channel it is called wind phlegm, in the lung channel it is named qi phlegm, and in the kidney channel it is known as cold phlegm; treatments differ and should be addressed according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>If there is coughing without phlegm, use pungent and sweet substances to moisten the lungs. Therefore, when treating coughs, prioritize phlegm treatment; for phlegm treatment, prioritize regulating qi. Thus, Nánxīng and Bànxià are effective against phlegm, leading to spontaneous alleviation of cough; Zhǐkē and Chénpí promote the flow of qi, allowing phlegm to descend. For those with phlegm who can eat, use the Dà Chéngqì Tāng to mildly purge; if phlegm prevents eating, use the Hòubò Tāng for treatment. In summer, if cough accompanied by fever occurs, it is termed &quot;heat phlegm cough&quot; and should be treated with Four Liang of Xiǎo Chái Hú, adding One Liang of Shígāo and Half Liang of Zhīmǔ. In winter, if cough comes with chills and fever, it is termed &quot;cold cough&quot; and should be treated with Xiǎo Qīng Lóng plus apricot kernels. These are general principles; one should adjust based on the specific symptoms and timing, considering the condition&#39;s strength or weakness—this is the fundamental approach to treatment.</p>
<p>When one Yang is affected, there may be slight coughing and diarrhea, with the three jiaos (organs) not functioning well, resulting in coughing upwards and diarrhea downwards, with unsteady heart fire, manifesting as a pull; regulate the center and disperse to treat. </p>
<p>Coughing can originate from all five organs, due to inner injuries to the spleen and stomach, or from external wind-evil. The skin and hair are related to the lungs; wind and cold follow the source and enter, opening the pores for interior and exterior to connect, first transmitting to the lungs and resulting in cough, indicating lung heat. Cold transforms into heat, leading to phlegm production, hence wheezing fullness. The classics state: the throat feels obstructed like a knot; in severe cases, it leads to coughing blood. Chest fullness, wheezing, and thick, sticky phlegm indicate lung qi heat.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Cough Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Cough refers to the presence of sound without phlegm, indicating injury to the lung qi and lack of clarity. Sputum refers to the presence of phlegm without sound, caused by dampness in the spleen leading to phlegm. A cough with phlegm and sound occurs due to lung qi injury, which activates spleen dampness, resulting in sputum. </p>
<p>For treating cough, addressing phlegm is the priority, and for treating phlegm, boosting qi takes precedence. Therefore, Naxing and Banxia resolve phlegm, while Zhike and Chenpi help disperse qi. For those with phlegm who can eat, Datchengqi Decoction gently purges. For those with phlegm who cannot eat, Houpo Decoction is prescribed. </p>
<p>In summer, cough with fever is called heat phlegm cough; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with an additional 2 taels of gypsum and half a tael of Zhimu should be used. In winter, cough accompanied by cold and heat is referred to as cold cough; Xiao Qinglong Decoction plus apricot kernel should be taken. Honey-boiled ginger soup, honey-boiled orange peel soup, and burnt ginger with walnuts all treat non-phlegm cough. This is a general guideline, but adjustments should be made according to the time and specific symptoms.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>On the Duties of Filial Piety in Confucianism</strong> (Yuan, Zhang Congzheng)</p>
<p>Coughing and wheezing are essentially the same condition. Later scholars may distinguish cough as yang and wheeze as yin, but there is no substantial evidence for this. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses coughing exclusively in one section, without mentioning wheezing. Therefore, it can be concluded that cough is simply another form of wheeze and vice versa. The &quot;Discussion on Yin and Yang&quot; states: &quot;In autumn, one suffers from dampness, leading to cough in winter.&quot; Additionally, the &quot;Five Organs Generation&quot; text mentions &quot;coughing and wheezing with difficulty in breathing.&quot; The &quot;Essential Diagnosis&quot; concludes that &quot;spring treatment addresses autumn cough, which is cyclical.&quot; It also indicates in the &quot;Calm and Composed&quot; section that persistent cough indicates a reversal of kidney energy. The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; exclusively addresses cough in its various sections, and other texts focus on cough without mentioning wheeze, thereby confirming that they refer to the same condition. Some may argue that wheeze is a separate condition, as indicated in writings on exogenous febrile diseases, which describe cough as a sound resembling stairs in the throat; this perspective is unfounded. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; treats wheeze simply as a cough. The &quot;Discourse on the Flowing Vital Energy&quot; states: &quot;In autumn, one suffers from dampness, leading to an upward reversal and cough.&quot;<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The discussion on the correspondence of yin and yang is essentially the same, and the absence of the character for &quot;cough&quot; indicates that a cough is clearly a form of &quot;sore throat.&quot; The reason I emphasize this is because Confucius said: &quot;One must indeed rectify names!&quot; Since coughs have historically been attributed to the lungs as a disease, this notion is not easily changed. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: lung diseases manifest as wheezing and cough. It also says: cough and shortness of breath occur with stagnation in the chest, affecting the hand&#39;s taiyin and yangming channels. Among the twelve meridians in the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; only the taiyin lung meridian mentions: &quot;The lungs are full and swollen, leading to wheezing and coughing,&quot; while the other meridians do not address it. Although the &quot;Suwen&quot; indicates that all five viscera and six bowels can have coughs, the essence lies in the lungs being central. The &quot;Suwen&quot; also says: &quot;The skin and hair are associated with the lungs; they are the first to receive pathogenic qi.&quot; The commentary suggests that the pathology refers to cold qi. The text further states: &quot;Pathogenic qi enters through their connection; if cold food and drink enter the stomach and travel up via the spleen meridian to the lungs, the lungs become cold. Cold lungs lead to an internal-external connection with pathogens, which can then result in a lung cough.&quot;<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Later generations see these words and wrongly conclude that coughing is due to cold, without comparing them to other texts. How could they know that all six qi can cause coughing? If one were to claim that coughing is due to cold evil, then how do we explain excessive fire in some years, where intense heat leads to lung evil, causing widespread coughing? Similarly, in years where wood is insufficient, the heart qi is delayed, overpowering the lung metal, resulting in coughs and nasal congestion. During periods of transformation, metal may be deficient, leading to sneezing and coughing; in times of hardening, excessive metal causes cough as well. In lesser yang&#39;s administration, fire descends while lung metal ascends, resulting in coughs and sneezes. When fire is excessive, it can lead to coughing up blood and restlessness. During lesser yang&#39;s control, if the body&#39;s defenses are strong, one experiences a full chest and cough; if the atmospheric heat becomes trapped, it can trigger reverse cough and vomiting. When the three qi arrive, heat is present, leading to people suffering from coughing and vomiting. In the final qi, if yang fails to contain itself, one will cough. In the rebound of lesser yang, dryness and excessive heat can cause frightening coughs and blood discharge, and in severe cases, reverse coughing leading to blood loss. In lesser yin&#39;s control, heat rises above while clear qi emerges from below, with cold and heat clashing in the middle, making people suffer from coughing and wheezing. When the three qi are active and the heavenly order is set forth, great fire spreads, secondary fire takes hold internally, swelling results in coughing and wheezing, and severe cases may lead to blood stagnation. In lesser yin&#39;s control, if external pathogens prevail, sneezing can occur, and in severe cases, coughing and wheezing may ensue. In the rebound of lesser yin, internal heat rises, qi moving left and right can lead to coughing, skin pain can enter the lungs, causing cough and nasal congestion.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If such conditions arise, they are all born from fire and heat; can one alone attribute them to cold? Is it said that coughing is solely due to heat and fire? When the Liver governs the heavens, if Wind prevails, then one experiences dizziness and tinnitus, which can lead to severe coughing. Such conditions stem from Wind, so how can they be solely attributed to heat and fire? Is it claimed that coughing is caused exclusively by Wind? When the Spleen governs the heavens, if Dampness prevails, coughing and spitting blood occur; with the restoration of the Spleen, Dampness transforms, fluids accumulate within, causing coughing and wheezing. These conditions are born from Dampness, so can they be exclusively attributed to Wind? Is it said that coughing arises solely from Dampness? If illness arises from the metal, people suffer from cough and chest pain; if there is an excess of metal for the year, dry air circulates, the Liver becomes afflicted, and people suffer from severe cough and reverse flow, which may even result in vomiting blood. When the Yangming governs the heavens, if Metal and Fire combine, people suffer from cough and throat obstruction; if Dampness dominates, coughing may occur, accompanied by abdominal noises. When Yangming governs, if the body is clear and retains excess, one may cough blood and have throat obstruction; if excessive heat remains in the heart, such cough does not cease and may expel white blood, leading to death. When Yangming is strong, clarity emerges from within, causing throat obstruction and cough; when Yangming is restored, clear air rises strongly, leading to cough and heart disturbance. If all these conditions arise from dryness, can one solely attribute them to Dampness? Is it claimed that coughing is caused only by dryness? When the Taiyang governs, if pathogenic influences prevail there is discomfort in the chest, leading to a runny nose; upon catching a chill, one coughs.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If this type arises in the cold, how can it be exclusively due to dryness? Furthermore, the symptoms of lung-related wind include excessive sweating, aversion to wind, a pale complexion, occasional shortness of breath, with improvement during the day and worsening at night; this is also classified as wind-related cough. The laborious wind cough produces yellowish-green phlegm, resembling pus and the size of a pellet; this too is a wind cough. If there is loss or something sought is unattainable, it leads to a sound from the lungs, indicating lung heat and dryness; this is a heat-related cough. Yangming counterflow presents with wheezing, coughing, and body heat; this is also a heat-related cough. A sudden onset of disease can cause slight breath and frequent coughing; this indicates fire-related cough. Wheezing cough results from dampness affecting the Yangming; this is damp-related cough. If wind and water cannot be righted, it leads to coughing; this is also damp-related cough. Kidney energy issues with a distended abdomen and swollen legs, along with heavy wheezing, reflect dampness-related cough. In cases of spleen obstruction, there is lethargy in the limbs and a cough that brings up fluids, leading to great cold; this is a cold-related cough. The six types of cough can indeed be distinguished based on their respective characteristics.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The cough driven by wind lacks moderation day and night, causing sweating and headaches, with phlegm and saliva not flowing easily; isn’t this a wind cough?

The cough driven by fire results in coughing and breathlessness with congestion, nasal discharge and spitting of blood, and in severe cases, blood pours from the seven orifices; isn’t this a fire cough? The cough driven by dryness leads to obstructed breathing, pain throughout the joints, sweating from the head and face, alternating cold and heat, dry and cracked skin, fine sores that itch, constipation and thick, sticky nasal discharge; isn’t this a dry cough? The cough driven by cold may result from exposure to cold, drinking cold beverages, sitting or lying on wet ground in winter, or exposure to cold wind; experiencing cough and rapid breathing in autumn or winter’s water; isn’t this a cold cough? As for treatment, for a wind cough, use Tongsheng San with Banxia and Ren Shen, or Banxia Wan; in severe cases, induce sweating. For a heat cough, use Baihu Tang, Xixin San, or Liangge San with a spoonful of honey mixed in to drink. For a fire cough, use Huanglian Jiedu Tang, Xixin San, or Sanhuang Wan, and in severe cases, add a strong purgative. For a damp cough, use Wuling San, Guiling Ganlu San, or Baizhu Wan, and in severe cases, use Sanhua Shenyuan Wan to purge. For a dry cough, use Mukxiang Tingli San, Dahuang Huanglian Ejiao Wan, and in severe cases, apply a strong cold purgative.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>For a cough caused by cold, it is treated with calming herbal powders for the mind and lungs; if there is cold phlegm in the upper part, one can use the gourd seed powder to dispel it. Although this method is nearly perfect, considerations must be made according to the individual&#39;s age, strength, condition, and body type. Illnesses can have different manifestations, and our prescriptions must also adapt accordingly. However, toxic substances like alum, dried ginger, black plums, and poppy husks can cause significant harm. Alas! I have seen many who have coughed since childhood, suffering into old age without recovery, yet they do not die. Conversely, there are many young people, regardless of gender, who perish within months from a cough. Surely, those who took the calming herbal powders for the mind and lungs must have included such afflicted individuals? Those who do not recover and die are not suffering from a cold-induced cough but instead cling to ineffective remedies like winter flowers and Buddha&#39;s ears, leading them to death without change. During the Cao-Wei period, a military officer named Li Cheng suffered intensely from coughing, unable to sleep day or night, sometimes coughing up blood and pus. Hua Tuo believed it did not originate from the lungs and administered a bitter concoction, leading to a substantial expulsion of pus and blood, resulting in recovery. Such cases of cough should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Wealthy and noble individuals often suffer from coughs due to thick phlegm caused by rich and greasy foods.

<p>For those who are poor and suffer from coughs, it is often due to internal and external factors such as wind, cold, and dampness. The Inner Canon states: &quot;In autumn, one suffers from dampness; in winter, coughs arise.&quot; It is beneficial to take calming formulas or lung soothing powders with ingredients like Atractylodes. The same restrictions apply.</p>
<p>For men who are ill—pale, hot-bodied, and emaciated, with fluctuating chills and fever resembling malaria, compounded by incessant coughing—some may experience facial swelling, body warmth, or spontaneous sweating. The Inner Canon notes this as a case of cold damage accompanied by fatigue. How should it be treated? If the illness is superficial, the higher regions can be addressed using the Fangji powder to induce vomiting. After vomiting, it is essential to take a dose of Tongjie pill, followed by ginseng and astragalus powder, Danggui Decoction, or modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, selecting one as appropriate. The Inner Canon states that the treatment methods for both men and women are the same; by following these guidelines, successful outcomes can invariably be achieved.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Coughing Caused by Autumn Dampness</strong></p>
<p>Autumn is characterized by clear and crisp air, which leads to the gathering and descending energies of the body. When harmed by dampness, this is due to the lingering heat of late summer, which does not align with the principles of autumn. When the autumn vibe is insufficient, excess actions prevail, allowing fire to ascend and dominate metal. Since heart fire afflicts the lungs, lung Qi rebels, resulting in coughing. Those who cannot withstand this are disrespected; wood energy ascends, aligning with fire’s nature, causing continuous motion. Those born under this condition suffer illness, resulting in the depletion of kidney water. With prolonged excess of late summer, the energies of the triple burner become vigorous. The Mingmen (Gate of Life) is the convergence of the triple burner. Hence, kidney water is forced upwards and mingles with the damp heat of the spleen, creating phlegm, which leads to coughing with sound and sputum. If coughing does not occur in autumn but manifests in winter, it is due to the extreme of six Yin energies, and the air becomes conducive to harm, thus resulting in coughing in winter instead of autumn. Coughing represents the reversal and ascent of Qi. When Qi rises in rebellion, the face may swell slightly; if it intensifies, the entire body may swell, transforming into water retention. Therefore, it is said that when turbid Qi is present above, it causes distention. Moreover, it is stated that all depressive Qi belongs to lung metal.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>This is what it refers to. Spring is harmed by the wind, summer is harmed by the heat, winter is harmed by the cold; the reasoning for these is smooth and coherent, and the term &quot;time&quot; harms the term &quot;order.&quot; Only autumn is harmed by dampness, causing the term &quot;order&quot; to wound the term &quot;time,&quot; which readers do not doubt. These four instances have no excess and harm what they accompany. The evil comes later; the main qi of the year each misassigns its share, causing illness, which is a certain principle. If it is said that the term for autumn harms the term for dampness, its wording connects with the previous three sentences, but its reasoning and principles do not connect. Generally speaking, reasoning and principles are coherent and need not be bound by wording. Therefore, those who interpret poetry do not let wording harm meaning, nor let meaning harm intent, and thus they grasp its essence. Hence, it is said: &quot;Spring is harmed by the wind,&quot; which implies human capability is harmed by the wind, but that&#39;s not the case. If so, one would only suffer headaches from strong winds; how then could it be said that summer brings diarrhea? Now, saying &quot;spring is harmed by the wind&quot; clearly indicates time harms order. The classics state: &quot;The eastern winds bring infantile wind; they harm people externally in the muscles, but internally they reside in the liver.&quot; It is also said: &quot;In spring, the damage from Jia and Yi is called liver wind.&quot; Using these two sentences for comparison with the earlier text allows the reasoning to connect logically. </p>
<p>Discussion on the harm caused by dampness.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>In the Suwen, the chapter on the transmission of life energy states: In autumn, one is harmed by dampness, which causes an upward reversal leading to cough and results in weakness and numbness. The Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondence states: Being harmed by dampness in autumn leads to coughing in winter. Once autumn dampness prevails and winter moisture increases, the dampness and moisture interact, causing lung energy to weaken, which then manifests as coughing. The resultant weakness and numbness occurs because the internal dampness attacks the organs, resulting in upward coughing, while the external dispersal affects the tendons and leads to weakness. During autumn, the dampness is pervasive; being harmed by dampness during this season is a disruption of the long summer energy and its alignment with autumn. When autumn energy is insufficient, it falters and allows fire to rise and overcome metal. Since heart fire penalizes the lungs, lung energy reverses, leading to cough. What cannot be overcome is insulted, as wood energy ascends, sharing attributes with fire, causing continuous movement. Those affected suffer illness, leading to kidney water deficiency. With the long summer having reached excess, the energy of the Triple Burner is strong. The Mengmen, or life gate, is the convergence of the Triple Burner. Hence, the forced ascent of kidney water combines with the damp heat of the spleen soil to form phlegm, which, in turn, causes coughing with sound and phlegm. Coughing that does not arise in autumn but in winter is due to the extreme of six yin, where the onset of contraction begins to take effect. Thus, being harmed by autumn dampness results in upward coughing, leading to weakness and numbness.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>The root of illness is the same as that of the spring wind, summer heat, and winter cold; however, their influences vary with the seasons. Each of these three corresponds to its own season&#39;s characteristics. Dampness is the characteristic of late summer, but what of autumn? Each season—spring, summer, and winter—has its own three months, so their influences operate within their respective periods. However, late summer&#39;s influence is primarily concentrated in the month of June. Although autumn also has its three months, the dampness from late summer often extends into autumn, which is why it is said that autumn is harmed by dampness. Regarding the notion that autumn is harmed by dampness, the principles governing its seasonal influence have been discussed previously. In the earlier section, it mentioned conditions such as cough due to counterflow, leading to paralysis and numbness, without specifying a delay in timing, suggesting that these arise immediately. But since it was mentioned alongside wind, heat, and cold, could this be solely interpreted as an immediate reaction?<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>However, although there is no clear text, I dare not compare it with the later chapters, and thus I decisively conclude that winter is the season for the onset of disease. Nevertheless, dampness is fundamentally a consequence of late summer, which encroaches upon autumn; even if it arises, it is indeed late in coming. This should only be discussed in relation to the diseases that manifest in autumn. Dampness originates from below, thus causing the lungs to dry, which leads to coughing, referred to as upward rebellion. The lungs are the master of all qi, so if there is already an illness, the qi cannot circulate outward, and dampness stagnates in the meridians, causing the limbs to become weak and powerless, and sometimes even cold and pale. The later chapter&#39;s mention of winter cough, already stating that it arrives late, indeed differs significantly from the meaning in the earlier chapter. When dampness lingers and does not disperse, and as winter&#39;s cold qi rises prominently, the lungs detest the cold and may be harmed, thus allowing the dampness to invade the lungs and manifest as coughing. Can one glean this intent and discern its significance from the texts?<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Methods of Medicinal Use</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: When the lung is excessively active, external symptoms include a pale face and frequent sneezing, with feelings of sorrow and an inclination to cry. Internally, there are symptoms of wheezing, coughing, and reversal of qi, along with vexation, chest fullness, and heat. At night, there is excessive nasal discharge and frequent sneezing, with nasal blockage. The lung is greatly filled with metal (qi), supporting the mother (lung function). The heart, spleen, and lungs all suffer from cold evil, resulting in sweet saliva; water assaults earth, causing fear. The abdomen is greatly cold, and this condition is called &quot;cold in the middle.&quot; White phlegm forms bubbles; when lung qi is weak, it results in extreme cold, thus supporting the mother. One should expel kidney water from the lungs; it can only be resolved with pungent and warm medicine. If the mouth produces sweet saliva, it indicates stomach coldness and disharmony; thus, it should be dealt with using pungent, sweet, and warm remedies. Those who drink alcohol often experience this reverse transformation.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; regarding eleven types of cough: Liver cough is treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction; bile vomiting from the gallbladder is treated with Huang Qin plus Ban Xia and Sheng Jiang Decoction. Heart cough is treated with Jie Geng Decoction; small intestine qi deficiency requires Shao Yao and Gan Cao Decoction. Spleen cough can be treated with Sheng Ma Decoction; stomach expelling long parasites requires Wu Mei Pill. Lung cough is treated with Ma Huang Decoction; large intestine urinary leakage requires Chi Shi Zhi Yu Yu Liang Decoction or Tao Ren Decoction, and if it does not stop, use Zhu Ling Decoction to resolve water. Kidney cough is treated with Fu Zi and Xi Xin Decoction; bladder urinary leakage requires Fu Ling and Gan Cao Decoction. If a cough persists, it affects the San Jiao, presenting symptoms of coughing and abdominal fullness, loss of appetite, and drinking; this indicates a buildup in the stomach related to the lungs, leading to excessive nasal discharge, salivation, facial swelling, and reversed qi, which can be treated with Qian’s Yi Gong Powder.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method - Yuan Zhu Zhenheng</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing can be classified into categories such as wind-cold, phlegm-damp, fire-stagnation, labor cough, and lung distension. In spring, when the energy is rising, use cooling medicines, such as Erchen Decoction with herbs like Banxia or Jingjie. In summer, characterized by heavy fire, use Qinshi (Qu) or Lian (Tian) to address this. In autumn, damp heat harms the lungs, and in winter, cold from the wind attacks externally; after dispersing with medicines, use Banxia to expel phlegm to prevent recurrence. Wind-cold leads to phlegm retention; to open the pores, utilize Erchen Decoction with Ma Huang, Jie Geng, and Xing Ren to eliminate phlegm and adjust based on symptoms. Fire affects the metal element, thus transforming phlegm and reducing fire. For labor cough, it is advisable to use Si Wu Decoction with bamboo sap and ginger juice, primarily nourishing Yin. Dry coughs are challenging to treat; these are symptoms of fire stagnation where phlegm obstructs fire. Use bitter herbs to dispel it, followed by medicines that nourish Yin and clear fire, such as Si Wu with fried Gan Cao and bamboo sap; if not resolved, it can lead to labor cough, common among those who feel frustrated — the overturned warehouse method is effective. For significant lung deficiency cough, those who have kidney deficiency will often experience this. Use ginseng paste, complemented with Chen Pi and fresh ginger, generally accompanied by phlegm-expelling medicines.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>During the first half of the day, frequent coughing indicates excess heat in the stomach; use fritillary bulb and gypsum to reduce this stomach fire. If coughing increases in the afternoon, it suggests yin deficiency, and one must use the Four Substance Decoction with roasted rhizome and anemarrhena to lower the heat. Coughing at dusk indicates that heat is floating in the lungs; cooling herbs are not advisable, and it is better to use schisandra and gall to constrain and reduce it. Frequent coughing indicates food stagnation in the stomach, causing heat to flow into the lungs; treat this with anemarrhena and lycium bark to reduce it.</p>
<p>When there is lung distention and coughing, either left or right, leading to inability to sleep, this is due to phlegm combined with blood stasis, obstructing qi; one should nourish blood to promote qi flow, lower fire, and soothe the liver to clear phlegm, using the Four Substance Decoction with peach kernel, myrobalan, green peel, bamboo juice, and ginger juice. If there is coughing with pain in the flanks, one should soothe liver qi with green peel and phlegm-relieving herbs, and for fullness, use white mustard seeds and later apply the Er Chen Decoction with nux vomica, cyperus, indigo, green peel, and ginger juice. For coughing caused by blood stasis obstructing qi, use peeled peach kernels and wine-fried rhubarb, formed into pills with ginger juice.</p>
<p>To treat cough, fresh ginger is commonly used due to its pungent ability to disperse.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>Phlegm caused by fire moving upwards and resulting in cough should first treat the fire, then the phlegm, using herb such as Zhimu to stop the cough, clear the lungs, nourish the yin, and reduce fire. For nighttime cough, it is necessary to reduce the fire, as it is a cough in the yin part.</p>
<p>For treating cough, using millet husks is common and there is no need for doubt, but it is essential to first address the root of the illness; this is the subsequent medicine. The same applies to treating dysentery.</p>
<p>Labor cough, which is caused by fire stagnation, can be treated with Heshunzi to regulate lung qi. As the fire injures immensely, it leads to stagnation and fullness, causing inability to sleep. Use its sour and bitter flavor to help astringe and lower fire. Accompany this with Haishi,童便 (child&#39;s urine) soaked with Xiangfu, Caoshe, Qingdai, Xingren, and Banxiaqu, mixed with ginger and honey to dissolve; care must be taken to prioritize nourishing the yin.</p>
<p>For treating cough, moxibustion should be done on the Tian Tu and Lung Shu points to greatly disperse lung qi. The Lung Shu point is located one and a half inches to the side of the spinous processes of the third vertebra.</p>
<p>The master says: Cough that belongs to the yin part is often associated with yin deficiency and should be treated accordingly.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If one has a cough and experiences lung congestion that prevents sleep, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Lung atrophy primarily relies on nourishing lung qi, nourishing blood, and clearing heat.</p>
<p>For those who cough with an excess of lung qi, it is advisable to drain it, with mulberry bark as the main ingredient, complemented by pinellia and poria, to drain the excess and supplement the deficiency. If the lungs are dry, they should be moistened; if it is hot, use platycodon, licorice, anemarrhena, and chicken essence. If the voice is hoarse, it is associated with cold, and one should use asarum, pinellia, and ginger to disperse it. For lung deficiency, ginseng cream and ejiao are the main remedies. If there is yin deficiency, Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills are the key medicine, or anemarrhena and poria decoction can be effective. For yin deficiency with wheezing, add dried tangerine peel and a bit of licorice to the Four Substance Decoction to descend the qi and replenish the yin. White peony should be soaked in wine and dried.</p>
<p>For phlegm dampness accompanied by wind and cough, do not simply use bitter cold remedies like Qianqian Decoction or Phlegm-Exhausting Pills; additional ingredients such as soapberry, radish seeds, apricot kernels, and ginger juice pills should be included for dissolution.</p>
<p>For phlegm accumulation with coughing, blue indigo, and loquat leaf are essential. Those with food accumulation often present with a pale yellow or whitish complexion, especially with areas resembling crab claws.</p>
<p>In cases of inverse cough, it cannot be alleviated without clam powder, blue indigo, loquat leaf, or fritillaria. For dryness in the mouth and throat with phlegm, do not use pinellia or nanteou, but use loquat leaf and fritillaria. Those who drink water should avoid loquat leaf, for fear of hindering the digestion.</p>
<p>Anemarrhena clears the lungs, stops coughing, nourishes yin, and reduces fire.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Almonds relieve lung qi; for those with prolonged qi deficiency and cough, one or two doses will suffice. To treat a wine-induced cough, use indigo and (herb) loquat, and dissolve ginger-honey pills to aid the lungs. For coughs with phlegm caused by food accumulation and fever, banxia and nanshen are the principal ingredients, with (herb) loquat and radish seeds as assistants, and indigo and baijian as the envoy.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming - Dai Sigong)</p>
<p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The ancients say: all organs and bowels can experience coughing. While coughing pertains to the lungs, why is it that all organs and bowels are involved? Coughing arises from illness, which can originate from external factors or arise internally. External factors include wind, cold, heat, and dampness; internal factors include emotions and issues related to hunger and fullness. Wind, cold, heat, and dampness first enter through the skin and hair; since the skin and hair are connected to the lungs, even though these are external evils, they must first affect the skin before impacting the organs, resulting in coughing — this is the external invasion. On the other hand, if internal harm arises from emotions or issues of hunger and fullness, the pathogenic qi can rebel upwards. Since the lungs govern the entry and exit of qi, the pathogens of the five organs can ascend and cause coughing — this is an internal manifestation. However, not all instances of wind, cold, heat, and dampness result in coughing; this is due to the severity of the illness causing direct harm to the organs and not lingering in the skin. Similarly, not all emotional disturbances result in coughing; this occurs when the illness is still mild, remaining confined to the originating organ without immediately attacking upwards. Thus, in cases of cold damage with coughing, it is considered milder, while coughing due to emotional issues or hunger and fullness can reoccur over time. For all forms of coughing, regardless of whether the cause is internal or external, it is advisable to administer Erchen Decoction with half a qian each of apricot kernel, five flavors, and ginseng. If there is temporary alleviation after drinking one or two mouthfuls of water, it indicates a hot cough; if relief is found after sipping hot soup, it indicates a cold cough. For treating a hot cough, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with five flavors; for a cold cough, use Li Zhong Decoction with five flavors. These methods have been tried and proven effective, as noted in &quot;Medical Remnants.&quot;<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Coughs of various types can be treated with the Dream-Responding Guanyin Powder, and for those with wheezing, it is advisable to take the Yangzheng Pill before meals. For thick phlegm and a heavy cough, sometimes with blood, chew a pinch of mint and fresh sesame seeds, then take the Suzi Decoction to relieve the Qi. If a cough occurs after exposure to wind, with a dislike of wind and sweating, or the body feeling hot, or clear nasal discharge, administer Gui Zhi Decoction with half a penny of ginseng, apricot kernels, and Schisandra. For coughing with excessive sweating, when the body is weak and cannot tolerate heat medicines, give the Juhu Scent Powder. If a cough arises from cold exposure, with dislike of wind and no sweating, or body heat, or clear nasal discharge, prescribe the Apricot Decoction. </p>
<p>For coughs caused by both wind and cold, whether with dislike of wind with or without sweating, headache, body aches, nasal congestion, and thick, sticky tears, use the Xiao Qing Long Decoction. The above three remedies can be used for coughs associated with the Taiyang channel in cases of cold damage. For coughs resulting from heat, with spontaneous sweating and thirst, or a cold appearance with sweating, the Liuhe Decoction with one penny of Schisandra is appropriate. If the cough is due to dampness, with body aches and heavy sensations, or sweating or difficult urination, this is often due to heat entering water, exposure to rain and dew, or not changing out of wet clothes after bathing, and the Bai Zhu Decoction is recommended.</p>
<p>For hot coughs with a dry, painful throat, and nasal discharge of hot air, where phlegm is difficult to expel, yellow and thick, occasionally with blood streaks or a foul smell, or firm like clam meat, it is less favorable compared to wind-cold coughs where phlegm is clear and white. The Jin Fei Cao Powder is suitable, along with the realgar phlegm-harmonizing pill or mint decoction in the Eight Wind Powder to dissolve in the mouth.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>For a hot cough, it is advisable to add five-flavor herb, apricot kernel, and poria fungus to the Golden Boiling Herb powder. Combine ten ingredients and boil together with one jujube for particularly excellent effects, known as Xuanfu Decoction. </p>
<p>In the case of hot cough where various medications are ineffective, remove the bamboo leaves from the bamboo leaf gypsum decoction, add japonica rice, reduce the amount of Anemarrhena, and increase five-flavor herb and apricot kernel. This should be assessed as heat lodged in the upper jiao, between the heart and lungs, which can be treated.</p>
<p>For hot cough with loss of voice and sore throat, if one has consumed more cold medicine yet still cannot speak, it is advised to use fresh ginger juice to adjust the Xiaofeng Powder, adding a little bit at a time; or just use ginger juice alone. This is particularly suitable for loss of voice after a hot or cold cough. </p>
<p>Loss of voice due to coughing is not solely due to hot cough; it is essential to carefully examine the symptoms and choose appropriate medications, supplemented by sucking olive pills, along with strongly decocted single ingredient loquat leaf powder to be taken hot.</p>
<p>Cold and hot coughs may arise from changes in clothing, with both cold and heat affecting the person. This can happen when exposed to sudden cold or sudden heat, or when drinking hot or cold beverages. It is advisable to use both Golden Boiling Herb powder and Xiaofeng Powder combined, or consider Mengren Ginseng Powder, or (wild) winter flower powder, or Ermu Powder; additionally, use cinnabar phlegm-dissolving pills, Eight Wind Pills, or Four Harmony Pills to suck on.</p>
<p>Cough from emotional fluctuations tied to hunger and satiety is simply the result of injuring the internal organs and the righteous qi, causing evil qi to rise and form phlegm, leading to obstruction in the lung pathways. It is necessary to first regulate the situation with a half dose of the Siqi Decoction, adding a half coin each of mulberry bark, apricot kernel, five-flavor herb, ginseng, and donkey-hide gelatin.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>If one coughs up blood-stained phlegm along with food, this is likely due to irregular eating and drinking, leading to discord in the liver qi, combined with an external pathogen affecting the lungs. The liver governs turbidity, while the lungs govern clarity; the interaction of clarity and turbidity necessitates the use of Erchen Decoction with equal parts of wood fragrant herb, apricot kernel, asarum, and bitter orange. </p>
<p>For those who drink cold liquor or cold water, harming the lungs and causing cough, commonly referred to as &quot;lung congestion,&quot; it is advisable to use Purple Aster Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of labor-induced cough, whether due to prolonged illness or due to excessive labor, symptoms may include alternating chills and fever, or just heat without chills, a dry throat and sore throat, extreme fatigue, with phlegm that may be thick or have an unusual blood-tinged odor, and inability to speak. The remedy is to take Lung Tonifying Decoction, half a dose, adding apricot kernel, fritillaria, winter flower, donkey-hide gelatin, and lily, each in equal parts, decocted, strained, and mixed with powdered milk. For throat pain, add half a dose of platycodon; for severe voice issues, add half a dose of gentiana; for nausea, remove rehmannia and add pinellia in equal quantities; for shortness of breath, add magical sand pill or three wonderful pills.</p>
<p>For those who have a persistent cough for years without resolution, having taken medicine without improvement and showing no other symptoms, distinguishable from labor-induced cough, the remedy should be San&#39;ao Decoction, supplemented with Qingjin Dan. </p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach are normal and diet is unrestricted, one may add flavored ginseng lung-clearing soup or ginseng and millet soup. For sudden cough that does not respond to treatment, one may take live deer antler pills or large dodder seed pills for healing. This is attributed to kidney deficiency, having both root and branch issues, but it should not be treated hastily for sudden cough. However, those who recover swiftly, do so because they recognized the issue early.</p>
<p>Coughing with blood indicates the presence of a cough blood syndrome.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>At that time, there were symptoms of coughing, fever, chills, headache, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath, resembling an injury from hot and cold. Continuous coughing ensued, and after a day or two of illness, the condition became lighter. In the autumn of the Year of Renwu, this illness spread throughout the city, following the summer and autumn transition of the Year of Jiayin. Few escaped it, and it was collectively referred to as the &quot;Toad Plague.&quot; The remedy used was a variant of the Shen Su decoction with half a money of xixin (Asarum). </p>
<p>For those with a cough producing much phlegm, it is termed &quot;Labor Cough,&quot; distinct from coughs due to wind, cold, or heat. This condition has both a fundamental aspect and a symptomatic one; the basis lies in the kidneys while the symptoms manifest in the lungs. One may seek remedies for deficiency and select those including wuwu fruit, apricot kernels, ejiao (donkey-hide gelatin), fritillaria bulbs, and other similar herbs. </p>
<p>For coughs accompanied by wheezing, grind more agarwood into the previous formula, and you may also consume Ling Sha Dan or San Miao Dan. Should the cough present with blood, refer to the detailed account of blood-related cough symptoms.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise</strong> (Ming, Lou Ying)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>Coughing as an illness can be classified: if there is a cough with phlegm, it indicates that the spleen is strong against dampness, causing phlegm to be slippery. If there is a persistent cough that does not produce phlegm, it indicates that the lungs are dry, overpowering the phlegm and dampness. For the slippery type, one should use herbs like Nanzheng, Banxia, or Zaohua to dry the spleen, while avoiding remedies that promote Qi. For the dry type, one should use herbs like Zhike, Zisu, or Xingren to strengthen the lungs, while avoiding remedies that dry out the lungs. </p>
<p>If there is a lung cough accompanied by wheezing, leading to spitting blood, one should use Mahuang Decoction. If the cough is from the large intestine with uncontrollable bowel movements, one should use Chishizhi Yu Yuliang Decoction or Taoren Decoction; if it persists, use Zhuling Fen Shui San. </p>
<p>For a cough associated with heart pain and a sensation of obstruction in the throat, especially severe cases leading to throat blockage, use Jiegeng Decoction. A cough from the small intestine that results in loss of breath — if both breath and cough are lost — requires Shaoyao Gancao Decoction, which is due to the small intestine&#39;s connection to the heart. A cough from the liver with pain beneath the ribs, especially severe enough to prevent turning, indicates fullness below the ribs and should be treated with Xiao Chaihu Decoction.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Zhongjing said: When a cough is accompanied by pain in the hypochondrium, it is due to suspended fluid, and the appropriate remedy is the Ten Jujube Decoction. Danxi stated: A cough with hypochondriac pain should be treated by soothing the liver qi, using ingredients such as Qingpi, Zhihua, and Xiangfuzi; if there is fullness, the use of Baijiezi and similar herbs is indicated. For a cough with bile, which includes vomiting bile, Huangqin should be combined with Banxia and Shengjiang in a decoction. For a spleen cough, with pain in the right hypochondrium that can refer to the shoulder and back, which may be severe enough to hinder movement, the Shengma Decoction is recommended. For a stomach cough with vomiting, especially if severe enough to bring up long worms, Wumei Pills are appropriate. A kidney cough characterized by pain in the lower back that may also reflect in the throat, leading to coughing up phlegm, calls for a decoction of Mahuang with Fuzi and Xixin. For a bladder cough with incontinence, the Fuling and Guangcao Decoction is indicated. A cough associated with fullness in the three burners, where one lacks appetite, may require treatment for heat phlegm with the Xiaohanjiao Decoction or the Mengshi Pills, as well as methods to clear the diaphragm and transform phlegm; if it persists, one should consider methods to expel phlegm-heat. A pale face with sorrowful sneezing, or chest distension and pain, or thin, weak, or slow pulse with cough may indicate cold fluid in the chest and abdomen, which should be treated with warming spicy herbs. </p>
<p>For a dry cough.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Dry cough refers to a condition without phlegm but with sound. This symptom originates from Qi stagnation. In mild cases, one may cough several times before phlegm is produced; in severe cases, one may cough dozens of times without producing phlegm. This is what is referred to as a dry cough.</p>
<p>Coughing indicates sound, resulting from lung Qi damage and lack of clarity. &quot;Cough&quot; indicates phlegm, arising from spleen dampness. A cough occurs due to lung Qi injury and spleen dampness activation. Although the illness can be classified into the six energies and five organs, the key points all pertain to the lungs, which govern Qi and manifest sound. The treatment method must distinguish between new and chronic conditions, deficiency and excess. For new illnesses, if it is due to wind-cold, expel it; if it&#39;s due to fire-heat, clear it; if it&#39;s due to damp-heat, drain it. Chronic illnesses belong to deficiency or stagnation; if there is Qi deficiency, tonify Qi; if there is blood deficiency, tonify blood; if there is stagnation, dispel it; nourish, moisten, and consolidate are the methods for treating deficiency. </p>
<p>The prescription includes peeled bitter almonds, white poria (each one qian), tangerine peel (seven-fifths qian), five-flavor fruit, balloon flower root, and honey-fried licorice (each five-fifths qian). In spring, when the rising Qi is abundant, it is suitable to moisten the lungs and soothe the liver, adding chuanxiong, peony, and pinellia (each one qian), and fried ophiopogon, yellow qin (each five-fifths qian), and anemarrhena. </p>
<p>In spring, if there is a cough due to a cold with clear nasal discharge, it is advisable to use acrid and cool herbs, adding wind protective herbs, mint, fried yellow qin, and ophiopogon (each one qian). </p>
<p>(Note: If the previous condition is caused by wind-cold, for a heavy cough with a headache, use Jinfeicao powder. For a heavy cough and body heat with a headache, use the formulated Xiaofeng San.)<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The lung governs the skin and hair; if lung qi is deficient, the pores will not be tightly closed, allowing external wind pathogens to easily invade. The appropriate treatment is to release the exterior while also reinforcing lung qi. If there is excess heat in the lungs, the pores will not remain closed, and wind pathogens will invade from the outside. Treatment should focus on releasing the exterior while clearing lung heat; once the pathogen retreats, the treatment should stop. If dispersing treatments are frequently applied, this could severely deplete body fluids, leading to lung abscesses or atrophy. Therefore, when the lungs are invaded by pathogens and fail to transform and transport, resulting in insufficient urination, gradual swelling of the skin, and an increase in coughing, one should use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the spleen and lungs, and the Six Flavor Pill to nourish kidney fluids.</p>
<p>In summer, there is an abundance of heat, with the most intense inflammation rising. It is advisable to clear metal and lower fire by adding mulberry root, anemarrhena, panaxia, ophiopogon, and gypsum, each for one qian. </p>
<p>Note: According to Wang Taifu, the master of water oversees the regulation of yang brightness. For symptoms such as rapid breathing and cough, with flushed face and a large, surging pulse, use the Huanglian Jiedu Decoction; for heat dryness and coughing, use the Gardenia Fruit Decoction; for coughing up blood, use the Ophiopogon Decoction. These treatments can be combined with the Six Flavor Pill. In the summer, it is particularly necessary to use these to reinforce kidney water and support lung metal.</p>
<p>In autumn, there is excessive damp heat that harms the lungs; it is advisable to clear heat and drain dampness, adding angelica, mulberry root, five fen each, and five fen each of prepared fangfeng, huangqin, and gardenia, sautéed.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>【Note: If there are symptoms such as coughing, fever, spontaneous sweating, dry mouth, and red urination, along with a weak and flooding pulse, use Bai Hu Decoction. If symptoms include fever and restlessness, shortness of breath, fullness in the chest, tiredness in the limbs, and diminished vitality, use Xiang Ru Decoction. If the pathogenic factor has already been eliminated, it is advisable to use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding dried yam and Schisandra to nourish the original qi, along with both Chai Hu and Sheng Ma in small amounts to uplift the vital energy.】 Winter often brings external wind and cold, hence it is suitable to release the exterior and resolve phlegm; add Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Ban Xia, Gan Jiang, and Fang Feng, each in small amounts. If there is a tendency towards heat in the lungs, additionally use wine-fried Huang Qin and Zhi Mu, each in moderate doses. If there is fever, headache, nasal congestion, and a heavy voice, then add Gao Ben, Chuan Xiong, Qian Hu, and Chai Hu, using equal portions. 【Note: In cases where it is indeed due to external wind-cold, and both physical symptoms and qi are strong, it is advisable to use Ma Huang and similar medications, which work from the exterior in and out. However, if both physical symptoms and qi are weak, it is better to nourish the original qi while assisting with exterior-releasing medicines. Solely focusing on releasing the exterior may weaken lung qi and open the interstitial spaces, allowing external pathogens to enter easily, thus making the illness harder to treat.】<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>If the illness lasts for a long time, or if one mistakenly takes a dispersing remedy, leading to a deficiency of vital energy while pathogenic Qi becomes excessive, it is urgent to focus on tonifying the spleen to restore balance, allowing the lung to be nourished and diseases to resolve on their own. If an elderly or weak person, or one who has exhausted their vital energy, suffers from prior symptoms and mistakenly uses herbs like Ephedra, Bitter Orange, or Perilla, leading to sweating and loss of Yang, they are likely to suffer from lung abscess or pulmonary consumption. Failing to use appropriate treatments may lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p>If there is phlegm, add Pinellia and Bitter Orange. For phlegm due to wind, also add Nanjing Ginger stir-fried. For damp phlegm, with a weak spleen and little appetite, add Atractylodes and Cang Zhu. If phlegm leads to dry mouth and throat, do not use Pinellia or Nanjing; instead, it is advisable to add Anemarrhena, honey water stir-fried, Fritillaria, and Scrophularia stir-fried.</p>
<p>Note: If the previous symptoms are due to spleen Qi deficiency causing damp phlegm, it is advisable to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If they are due to kidney yin deficiency heat causing dry mouth and throat, it is better to use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan.</p>
<p>If there is hot phlegm in summer, or if one has a history of hot phlegm, add Scutellaria, Coptis, Anemarrhena, and Gypsum.</p>
<p>Note: If the previous symptoms are due to heart fire attacking the lungs, lightly use Mai Men Dong Decoction; if severe, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San. If there is excess heat in the upper burner, use Liang Ge San; for deficiency heat, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction. For excess heat in the middle burner, use bamboo leaf and gypsum decoction; for deficiency heat, use bamboo leaf and Astragalus decoction. For deficiency heat in the lower burner, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan.</p>
<p>If there is daytime coughing, indicating fire in the stomach, add Fritillaria, Gypsum, and Coptis.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Coughing at the fifth watch is similar to what has been discussed above. </p>
<p>[Note: If the patient has severe heat in the stomach, the original formula should be used to release it. If there is mild heat in the stomach causing the issue, then Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction should be used to clear it. For cough resulting from deficiency heat in the stomach, one must use the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction to nourish it, along with some agents to treat phlegm. For coughing at the fifth watch, it should be treated as phlegm due to spleen deficiency from retained food.]</p>
<p>If coughing persists and there is lung deficiency, one should nourish qi and supplement blood by adding ingredients such as ginseng, astragalus, eaglewood, angelica, ginger, asparagas, ophiopogon, and prepared white peony, among others. If there is tightness in the lungs due to heat, ginseng should be removed from the formula, which will also nourish blood and qi.</p>
<p>[Note: The lungs belong to metal, which is generated by the spleen’s earth. Whenever the lung metal is afflicted by pathogens, if the spleen’s earth is weak and cannot nourish the lungs, disease will ensue; therefore, treatment should be carefully examined.]</p>
<p>For coughs during twilight, as fire rises in the lungs, one must avoid using cold and cool medications. It is advisable to include ingredients such as Schisandra, sumac, and haritaki peel to restrain and descend this condition.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The previous diagnosis pertains to a deficiency of spleen and lung qi, leading to deficiency in the kidney&#39;s yang and weakness of yin, resulting in the upward disturbance of false fire. Additionally, excessive sexual activity can harm the true yin, thus the method should focus on tonifying the spleen and lungs to generate kidney water, rather than concentrating solely on the lungs.</p>
<p>If there is coughing in the afternoon, it belongs to yin deficiency, which indicates exhaustion from labor. One should nourish yin and reduce fire, adding ingredients such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, Peony, Rehmannia, Rhizoma Coptidis, Anemarrhena, bamboo liquid, ginger juice, Asparagus, Trichosanthes, and Fritillaria, specifically to replenish yin blood.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The previous diagnosis indicates a deficiency of kidney qi, with fire inflammation and depletion of fluid. If there is an abundance of phlegm due to flooding fluids, this affects the true organs. One must use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to strengthen kidney water as the primary treatment, supplemented by the Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction to nourish the spleen, which in turn supports the lungs and kidneys. If clearing qi to transform phlegm is used, it would be a mistake.</p>
<p>If there is a cough caused by fire stagnation, with phlegm and fire pathogens in the middle, one should resolve stagnation and eliminate phlegm. Use a mixture of Chebula fruit peel, Cyperus, Trichosanthes, Banxia, sea stone, indigo, and Huangqin, ground into powder and mixed with honey to form pills for sucking and dissolving. Continue taking the previously prescribed herbs to nourish yin and reduce fire; failure to treat properly may lead to exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The previous diagnosis applies if heat is retained in the lungs and stomach, causing obstruction of phlegm and qi. It is advisable to use this method. If it is due to unclear spleen and lung, resulting in stagnant qi and phlegm, use Erchen Decoction combined with Gardenia and Zhike. If due to stagnation damaging the spleen with deficiency of qi and blood, use Jisheng Guiqi Decoction with Gardenia and Platycodon.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>If anger stirs the liver and generates fire that overcomes the spleen, use the Four Gentlemen decoction with added Gardenia and Bupleurum. If excessive labor improperly injures the vital energy, use the Enhance the Middle and Benefit Qi method with added Gardenia and Platycodon.</p>
<p>If cough arises from phlegm and food stagnation, use Fructus Cyperi, Fritillaria, Bulbophyllum, Sea Stone, Indigo, Banxia, Gypsum, Hawthorn, Bitter Orange, and stir-fried Coptis to make a powder, then mix with honey to dissolve and absorb.</p>
<p>Note: For symptoms arising from food stagnation and damp-heat caused by improper diet, the original formula is appropriate. If phlegm accumulation is due to spleen and stomach qi deficiency, use the Six Gentlemen decoction with added Bitter Orange and Wood Aromatic. If food stagnation is due to spleen and stomach qi deficiency, use the Six Gentlemen decoction with added Shenkui and Malt.</p>
<p>Cough with early morning phlegm indicates food stagnation, while shortness of breath and coughing indicates lung qi deficiency with excess fire. Generally, treatment should focus on assisting the stomach and reinforcing qi, rather than solely targeting phlegm.</p>
<p>If cough is accompanied by blood, add Ejiao, Angelica, Peony, Asparagus, Anemarrhena, Fritillaria, and White Mulberry bark, selecting from the previous notes on lung and yin deficiency. Generally, coughing with blood is often due to heat affecting the lungs, where pathogenic heat transforms into fire, causing excessive fire disrupting yin and blood, thus rising from the fire. Therefore, treatment should aim to drain fire and nourish yin, avoiding sweet and warm herbs like ginseng.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>If there are those with Qi deficiency who cough up blood, then one should use medicines like ginseng, astragalus, and (various winter flowers); however, such cases are not common. </p>
<p>[Note: In previous cases, there are also those injured due to overexertion, where internal fire errantly stirs and damages the lungs, as well as those harmed by overstrain on kidney water, where yin fire rises and injures the lungs. Some may suffer from overuse of cold medications like Tianmen and Shengdian, which harm the spleen and stomach, preventing the generation of lung metal without recovery. Others may incorrectly use substances like Coptis, which injure Yang Qi and impede the generation of yin essence, leading to a lack of recovery. All of these issues stem from deficiencies in the spleen and lungs, along with insufficient kidney water, causing upward-spiraling false fire, thereby endangering the true organs. It is essential to use the Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction) to tonify the spleen earth and generate lung metal, along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill) to nourish kidney water and generate yin essence; otherwise, there will be no remedy.]</p>
<p>In cases of coughing with phlegm, if the cough is significant, the main treatment focuses on the lungs. If the phlegm causes the cough, the phlegm is significant, and the main treatment focuses on the spleen. However, if food accumulation transforms into phlegm, causing Qi to rise and resulting in cough, it is sufficient to treat the phlegm and resolve the accumulation, allowing the cough to stop on its own without the need for lung medicines.</p>
<p>[Note: According to previous treatment methods, it is critical to differentiate between the six excesses and seven emotions, as well as the interactions among the five organs, treating the spleen and lungs based on their deficiency or excess. Otherwise, there is a risk of developing lung abscess symptoms.]<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p>
<h1>Introduction to Medicine: General Discussion on Coughing</h1>
<p>Coughing is mostly a result of lung fire. Why is it associated with the symptoms of a solar disease in terms of cold damage? The lungs are the canopy of the five organs, internally connected to the bladder, externally governing the skin and hair, and are the master of qi. When qi rebels and does not descend, coughing occurs. When wind and cold invade, the qi becomes stagnant due to the cold; when heat pathogens invade, the qi becomes dry and obstructed. When fluid obstruction occurs, the interaction with qi can lead to phlegm, which is also a source of coughing. </p>
<p>In cases of wind and cold, if there is a solar syndrome with fever, vomiting, and wheezing, use Mahuang and Xingren Decoction; for coughing and wheezing, use San&#39;ao Decoction. In the lesser yang syndrome with chills and fever coupled with chest fullness or diarrhea, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus ginseng and jujubes, adding Schisandra and dry ginger. In the lesser yin syndrome with cold extremities, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, use Si Ni Decoction plus Schisandra and dry ginger; for lesser yin cough with vomiting, thirst, restlessness, insomnia, and diarrhea, use Zhu Ling Decoction.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>In spring and winter, wind and cold cause harm; in summer and autumn, dampness and cold are damaging. Symptoms include nasal congestion and throat sounds, with qi obstructed, leading to coughing. For this condition, prepare a decoction of tangerine peel and bamboo shavings. If the cough is due to heat, use Jinfeicao Powder, Chaihu Banxia Decoction, or Xiebai Powder. If there is coughing up of phlegm with blood, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction with Huangqin and black beans. If coughing occurs with fever and fullness and pain in the abdomen, treat it with Da Chaihu Decoction. If there is fullness in the abdomen with vomiting, use Da Banxia Decoction. After a purging treatment, if there’s cold in the stomach with lack of appetite, use Lizhong Decoction or Liu Junzi Decoction, both with added Schisandra and Asarum. If phlegm and qi are excessive, use Da Tangerine Peel Decoction. For those with chronic phlegm-fire conditions, adjust with Qinjian Erchen Decoction.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are three patterns for water cough: Qinglong Decoction treats exterior cold water in the Taiyang stage, Shizao Decoction treats interior water stagnation in the Taiyang stage, and Zhenwu Decoction treats cold water in the Yin pattern. For all coughs with minor urination, sweating should be avoided, as prolonged issues can lead to internal damage. Those affecting the upper and lower jiao should not be treated.</p>
<p>Regarding the differentiation of coughs:</p>
<p>Coughing is caused by the movement of qi producing sound, while a “sou” (cough with phlegm) indicates blood transforming into phlegm. If lung qi is agitated, coughing occurs; if spleen dampness is involved, &quot;sou&quot; will happen. When both spleen and lung are affected, both coughing and “sou” arise. However, since the lungs are primary, coughing is more commonly referenced, with “sou” included within it.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Between Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>When coughing, one must first assess the condition of the lung pulses: if they are excess, they will be floating, large, and forceful; if they are sinking and slippery, then phlegm and qi are abundant. If they are deficient, they will be thin, large, and weak; if they are sinking, thin, and fast, then there is severe internal heat.</p>
<p><strong>External Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>If wind affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include nasal obstruction, a heavy voice, dry mouth, and itchy throat; one may cough before finishing speaking. Use Shen Su Decoction with mulberry bark and apricot kernels, or Chai Hu Ban Xia Decoction, followed by various cough pills. For chronic coughs, nighttime coughs, and winter coughs from wind entering the lung orifices, it is advisable to fumigate.</p>
<p>If cold affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include tightness in the chest and hoarseness; use Er Chen Decoction with ma huang and apricot kernels, or Su Chen Jiu Bao Decoction, Hua Gai Powder, or Dan Sheng Jiang Pills. For those with simultaneous cold and heat, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is recommended. There is a condition called &quot;cold and warmth reaction,&quot; where cold wraps heat, and relieving the surface will eliminate it. Use Zhi Geng Decoction with ma huang, fang feng, apricot kernels, chen pi, zi su, mu tong, and huang qin. For coughs at night due to wind, cold, and obstructed heat, use San Yao Decoction with zhi mu and huang qin.</p>
<p>If summer heat affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include dryness of the mouth, hoarseness, and foamy sputum; use Liu Yi San with cinnabar. If there is blood, use loquat leaf powder. </p>
<p>If damp affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include heavy body and painful joints; use Wu Ling San or Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, in spring, the qi rises, nourishing the lungs and soothing the liver; in summer, the fire rises, clearing metal and lowering heat; in autumn, dampness and heat are severe, thus clearing heat and draining dampness; in winter, wind and cold are heavy, necessitating resolving the surface and transporting phlegm.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>Internal Injury</strong></p>
<p>Fire cough with much phlegm and little sputum, if frequent at dawn, is caused by food accumulation with damp heat flowing into the lungs. Use Xiao Baitang (Spleen-reinforcing powder) with Zhimu, or the ancient Ermu powder. If there&#39;s frequent cough in the late morning, it&#39;s due to excess fire in the stomach; use Dan Shigao pills with Zhibei. For constipation, thirst, and thick phlegm, use Liangge powder, Baidu powder, or Guqin Ban pills. Frequent cough in the late afternoon indicates Yin deficiency; use Siwu decoction mixed with Erchen tang added with Zhimu, Huangbai, and Mai Men Dong to nourish and cool down. If there are signs of Yin deficiency with fire dryness, cold and heat, night sweats, or blood in sperm, use Siwu decoction with Zhu Li, or Zhi Yin Jiang Huo decoction, or the modified Ermu pills. If there&#39;s frequent cough at dusk, it indicates fire floating in the lungs; use Runfei pills to suppress it, and do not solely rely on cold medicines. Generally, use Erchen decoction without Ban Xia, adding Beimu, (Chinese herb: Tongcao), Qingdai, Shanzhi, Huangqin, and Sangbai Pi.</p>
<p>Stagnation cough is fire cough; if prolonged, it becomes a dry cough with no phlegm, indicating kidney water depletion, with evil fire burning in the lungs. Use Xiao Baitang with bitter stem as the chief drug to break it up. For prolonged cases, use Heli Wan; for deficiency, use Shenqi Wan; if unsuccessful, use Xiatian Gao. If there are dry lungs, dry skin, itchy sores, and constipation, aim to invigorate blood and moisten dryness; use Shengjin beverage.</p>
<p>Labor cough is a cough resulting from five types of labor. Exhaustion harms the liver; if there&#39;s cough with pain in the left rib and lower abdomen, use Erchen decoction with Xiong, Gui, Shaoyao, Qingpi, Chaihu, Longdant, Huangqin, and Zhuru, or Huangqi Jianzhong decoction. Mental strain harming the heart, with cough, dry throat, and blood in sputum suggests using Jielao powder or Mengshou Tianwang’s Heart Supplement pill.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>Fatigue and strain can harm the spleen, leading to cough and shortness of breath with weakness. For this, use the Decoction to Regulate the Center and Benefit Qi or the Decoction to Tonify the Center and Benefit Qi. If the lungs are injured from shouting, causing cough and white foam vomiting, with dryness of the mouth and hoarse voice, use the Moistening Lung Pill or Ginseng Clear Lung Drink. If the kidneys are damaged due to sexual exhaustion, resulting in cough and pain in the lower back, along with chills and fever, use the Erchen Qionggui Decoction. </p>
<p>Another condition, known as consumption cough, involves persistent dry cough due to exhaustion; it is advisable to use ingredients like gecko, heavenly lid, realgar, and cinnabar, and must be addressed in the context of consumption. </p>
<p>Cough due to food accumulation leading to phlegm and fullness in the chest and abdomen should be treated with Erchen Decoction, adding magnolia bark, hawthorn, or barley sprouts. Injury from consuming raw cold foods can cause indistinctness in the lungs and stomach, resulting in sour belching and diarrhea with aversion to wind and cold; treat this with Wujisan, Li Zhong Decoction, or Yigong Powder. For injury from consuming hot and roasted foods, use Tingli Powder or Sanbu Pill with additions of Anemarrhena and Fritillaria.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>For those harmed by food and drink, use the Xiangfu (Cyperus) and Louqing Dazhui pill. If the seven emotions disturb the internal organs, it can lead to coughing; if this persists, it may affect the six bowels. Anger harms the liver, causing fullness beneath the ribs, and affects the gallbladder, leading to bitter vomiting. Joy damages the heart, resulting in heart pain and throat swelling, and if it affects the small intestine, one may cough and lose energy. Worry harms the spleen, causing cough with pain radiating to the right ribs and shoulder; if severe, movement may become difficult, and if it reaches the stomach, it can cause phlegm and long worms to be vomited. Sorrow affects the lungs, causing wheezing and coughing up blood; if it impacts the large intestine, it can lead to incontinence. Fear harms the kidneys, causing salivation and pain radiating to the lower back; if it affects the bladder, it leads to incontinence, and if it spreads to the Sanjiao, it can cause abdominal fullness and a loss of appetite. It begins with the lungs and ultimately settles in the stomach. Suitable remedies include Erchen Decoction with Lou Ren (Lou seeds) and radish seeds, Jiawei Xiebai San, Shen Su Decoction, Sihqi Decoction, Suzi Jiangqi Decoction, Tuan Shen Yinzi, Guju Gan San, Guju Lou Wan, and selected modifications of Sanqi Decoction.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm and Fluid Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm cough occurs when phlegm is expelled, leading to cessation of coughing, and there is a feeling of fullness in the chest and diaphragm. The classics state: &quot;In autumn, one is harmed by dampness; in winter, cough is inevitable.&quot; Dampness located in the heart is called &quot;heat phlegm,&quot; in the liver is called &quot;wind phlegm,&quot; in the lungs is called &quot;qi phlegm,&quot; and in the kidneys is called &quot;cold phlegm.&quot; Only when damp phlegm enters the stomach and ascends to the lungs will coughing arise, for which Qianqin Decoction, Zhuifang Pill, or Banxia Pill may be selected. When phlegm obstructs the lung meridian, resulting in excessive sputum during cough or a feeling of fullness in the chest, Erchen Decoction plus Zhiling, Banxia, Huangqin, and Fritillaria is advised, and in severe cases, He Ding Dan should be considered. If phlegm accumulates in the lung region leading to prolonged coughing that disrupts sleep, Douling Pill is effective. If phlegm is caused by fire, Erchen Decoction plus Qinlian or Qingqi Huatan Pill should be used. If phlegm is caused by food stagnation, Huatan Pill is suitable; if caused by liquor dampness, Fengluo Pill is required; if caused specifically by alcohol, Banlian Pill is appropriate. If phlegm is significant and leads to difficulty in eating with constipation, Xiaochengqi Decoction can be administered; if unable to eat with constipation, Houpu Decoction or Guntan Pill should be used for relief. </p>
<p>For coughing due to fluid retention, arising from drinking tea or water, which results in sputum rising, along with heat in the body and fullness in the chest causing palpitations, Xiao Qinglong Decoction is recommended; for cold body and hardness in the flanks, Zhenwu Decoction is suitable; for chest fullness, Xiaobanxia Decoction; for constipation, Shizao Decoction; and for difficulty in urination, Wulingsan is advised. Detailed treatment for water syndrome in typhoid is also included.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Stagnation of Blood</strong></p>
<p>When there is blood stagnation, coughing may produce a fishy smell in the throat. For mild cases, use Xie Bai Decoction with added Sheng Di, Shan Zhi Zi, Mu Dan Pi, Mai Men Dong, and Jie Geng. For severe cases, take a pill made from Tao Ren, Da Huang, and ginger juice. This may occur due to trauma or overexertion that injures the lungs, causing cough from wind-cold, or if blood appears dark purple. In such cases, use Si Wu Decoction without Chuan Xiong, adding Da Huang and Su Mu in powdered form, taken with wine to promote circulation of stagnant blood in the heart and lungs, stopping the symptoms, followed by Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction for tonifying. </p>
<p>If there is fullness in the lungs, it signifies that phlegm and stagnated blood are obstructing the qi, resulting in rapid breathing upon movement, or inability to lie on either side. Use Si Wu Decoction with added Tao Ren, He Zi, Qing Pi, Zhu Li, and ginger juice. If there is a deficiency causing fullness and wheezing, use only Ren Shen Gao or Gu Bai Hua Gao. If there is fluid retention causing distention, water intake may be counterproductive. Use San Bai Decoction with added Ze Xie, Jie Geng, and Wu Bei Zi. If due to extreme heat damage, resulting in distention without water, there will necessarily be dry cough without phlegm; use He Li Wan to dissolve, as He Zi can constrict and reduce heat, but it is also dangerous!<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br><strong>Regarding Recent and Chronic Coughs</strong></p>
<p>For a recent cough with phlegm, it is caused by external factors and should be dispersed according to the season; if there is no phlegm, it indicates heat, and should be cleared. For a chronic cough with phlegm, it requires drying the spleen and transforming phlegm; if there is no phlegm, then clear the metal and reduce the heat. Generally, prolonged external factors lead to stagnant heat, while prolonged internal injury leads to fiery inflammation; both conditions need to be resolved and moistened. If there are emotional disturbances or Qi counterflow, then the priority should be to use Zhiqiao and Xiangfu to regulate Qi; if there is stagnation of water and food, then Nansheng and Bintang should be used to disperse. For those with blood deficiency, it should be nourished and contained. If the root cause is not treated and excessive use of Douling or Sushe pills is applied, it may instead lead to lingering conditions. Moreover, the lungs are delicate organs, susceptible to cold and heat. Although Ren Shen is a neutral herb, it is most suitable for Qi deficiency. If there is heat in the lungs or a strong wind pathogen, Sand Shen or Yuan Shen should be substituted. Thus, coughing does not only relate to cold conditions. Prolonged coughing can also arise from issues with bowel movements, fatigue, and fluctuations in hunger and fullness, leading to cold in the lung and stomach, causing reduced appetite; in such cases, treating the spleen will lead to cessation of cough. However, the kidneys manage Qi; if coughing triggers an upward surge of Qi from below the navel, it indicates kidney deficiency where Qi does not return to its source. In this case, the medicine should include Guben Zhi and Wuweizi, or Sanwei An Shen Wan. For those with Yin deficiency, use Shen Qi Wan; for those with Yang deficiency, use Heixidan to calm. In cases where cough leads to lung distension or throat ulcers resulting in loss of voice, it is critical.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Coughing Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essential Readings for Medical Scholars</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>A sound without phlegm is called &quot;cough,&quot; caused by the fire in the lungs. A sound with phlegm is called &quot;sough,&quot; caused by the spleen being invaded by dampness. When there is both phlegm and sound, it is called &quot;coughing.&quot;</p>
<p>Although coughing is primarily a lung issue, all five internal organs and six hollow organs can contribute to it. Analyzing its causes, the classical texts often miss certain meanings; in summary, it results from internal injuries or external pathogens. External factors such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness harm the exterior first, affecting the skin and hair, which relate to the lungs. If the lung pathogen is not resolved, it can lead to illness in other organs, which originates from the lungs.</p>
<p>Internal injuries caused by labor or emotional distress affect the internal organs, injuring the vital energy, and manifesting in the upper body via the yin aspect. This flows from the internal organs to the lungs. </p>
<p>Illness that enters from the exterior is a yang condition that should be treated with warm and pungent remedies to disperse the pathogen; thus the lungs clear and coughing resolves. Illness that arises from within is a yin condition that should be treated with sweet tonics to strengthen the water element and nourish the metal element; thus the lungs settle and fire-induced coughing resolves.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>Generally, when treating exterior conditions, it is inappropriate to use medications that are quiet and static; stagnation leads to unresolved symptoms and the emergence of other ailments. Therefore, one should avoid cold, cool, and astringent treatments, as mentioned in the &quot;Five Organs Generation&quot; chapter, which states that the lungs desire pungent remedies. Conversely, when treating internal conditions, medications that are active are unsuitable; activity can lead to unrest caused by excessive yang, and symptoms like dryness and itching may worsen. Hence, one should avoid pungent, aromatic, and hot treatments, as indicated in the &quot;Five Qi&quot; chapter, which states that pungent substances stir the qi, and one should not excessively consume them. </p>
<p>However, while treating exterior conditions, it is necessary to use methods that disperse pathogens. If there is a concurrent deficiency of the body&#39;s structure, one must also tonify the central qi and assist with harmonization. If one solely focuses on dispersion, there is a risk that the lung qi may become weaker, the pores may become more open, allowing pathogens to exploit the deficiency and exacerbate the illness. </p>
<p>In treating internal conditions, although tranquility is necessary to nourish yin, if the fire at the life gate is weak and cannot return to its original strength, then herbs like ginseng, astragalus, cinnamon, and aconite must be used. Otherwise, the qi will not transform water, and there will ultimately be no benefit to yin. </p>
<p>As for conditions arising from fire, one should clear them; those caused by dampness should be resolved by promoting urination; phlegm-based issues should be dissipated; and those related to qi should be regulated. Treatment should be adjusted according to the observable symptoms. </p>
<p>For elderly and frail individuals, the focus should primarily be on gently nourishing the spleen and lungs, with a slight emphasis on treating exterior symptoms. However, if one desires rapid recovery and hastily attacks the pathogens, many dangers may arise, necessitating caution in all treatments!<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Coughs from the lungs: use Mahuang Decoction; coughs from the heart: use Jie Geng Decoction; coughs from the liver: use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction; coughs from the spleen: use Shengma Decoction; coughs from the kidneys: use Mahuang, Fuzi, and Xixin Decoction; coughs from the stomach: use Wumei Pill; coughs from the gallbladder: use Huangqin with Banxia and Ginger Decoction; coughs from the large intestine: use Chishi Zhi and Yuyuliang Decoction, and if not stopping, use Zhu Ling Fen Shui San; coughs from the small intestine: use Shaoyao and Gancao Decoction; coughs from the bladder: use Fuling and Gancao Decoction; coughs from the Sanjiao: use Qian&#39;s Yigong San. </p>
<p>For those affected by wind: dislike wind, sweating, clear nasal discharge, pulse is floating, use Guizhi Decoction with Fangfeng, Xingren, Qianhu, and Xixin; for those affected by cold: dislike cold, no sweating, clear nasal discharge, pulse is tight, use Erchen Decoction with Zisu, Gande, Xingren, and Jie Geng. </p>
<p>In the spring, wind-cold damage causes headaches and heaviness in the body; use Jinfeicao Decoction; in summer, wheezing and coughing, red face, floating pulse; use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction; in autumn, body heat, spontaneous sweating, dry mouth, red stools, weak pulse; use Dabaihu Decoction; in winter, wind-cold, both qi and syndrome are solid; adjust Mahuang Decoction accordingly. </p>
<p>For those affected by dampness: heavy body pain, use Baizhu Wine; heat cough with dry and painful throat, nasal emission of heat, thick foul phlegm; use Jinfeicao San, remove Mahuang and Banxia, and add Bohe, Piba Ye, Wuweizi, Xingren, Sangbai Pi, Beimu, Fuling, and Jie Geng; coughing with alternating chills and heat: use Jinfeicao San and Xiaofeng San, both decocted together. </p>
<p>For issues related to emotional states of hunger and satiety, where evil qi rises, use Siqi Decoction and add Xingren, Wuweizi, Sangpi, Ren Shen, Ejiao, Maidong, and Pibao Ye.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>Drinking cold leads to cough; use Purple Aster Decoction. If coughing brings up phlegm and food, add to Erchen Decoction: apricot kernel, wood fragrance, finely sliced wild ginger, and bitter orange. For cough caused by food accumulation, use Erchen Decoction with (herb) loofah, radish seeds, hawthorn, bitter orange, and fermented grains. For hoarseness due to external cold with underlying heat, use finely sliced wild ginger, pinellia, and fresh ginger to disperse it. If internal fire is damaging metal, it indicates a bad condition; promote water to clear metal. For longstanding cough with no other symptoms and differs from labor cough, use a single herb of hundred parts syrup. If the cough is vexing and troublesome, use Eight Flavor Pill or Anshen Pill. If sudden cough does not respond to various medicines, use big dodder seed pill; do not doubt that it is inappropriate for sudden cough. For cough with upward qi and a wet, chicken-like sound in the throat, use Shegan and Ephedra Decoction.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>Vinegar is to be used for gargling. Take two taels of peeled licorice, cut into two-inch pieces, split in half, and soak in the juice of five pig gall bladders for three days. Then, roast them into a fine powder, mix with honey to form pills, and swallow two qian with clear tea before sleeping. For coughing due to salty food, take two qian of white flour and two qian of sugar, mix with the ash of sugar cakes, mold into small cakes, and steam until cooked. Add four qian of light powder, stir-fry separately, cut the cakes into four pieces, and have the patient consume all of it; this will expel the root of the illness and cure them. For lung distension, cough, and shortness of breath with elevated nostrils and raised shoulders, if the pulse is floating and large, use the &quot;Yue Bi jia Ban Xia&quot; decoction. If there is no external pathogen but internal lung deficiency causing distension, it is advisable to use a powder made of he zi, hai shi, xiang fu, (the plant radical) lou ren, qing dai, ban xia, and xing ren, mixed with ginger juice and honey to dissolve. For lung distension with irritability and wheezing, a floating pulse, and water in the chest, use the Xiao Qing Long decoction with gypsum added. If the lung distension prevents sleep lying on either side, it indicates phlegm mixed with stagnant blood obstructing qi. Use the Si Wu decoction with added tao ren, he zi, qing pi, bamboo juice, and chive juice.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of Deficiency Consumption</strong></p>
<p>A cough without phlegm is termed &quot;ke,&quot; as the lungs are scorched by fire; for this, use the new “Qing Ning” syrup. A cough with phlegm and sound is termed &quot;sou,&quot; as the spleen is invaded by dampness; for this, the Er Chen decoction is appropriate. For those with spleen deficiency and fatigue, use the Liu Jun Zi decoction. If the cough is weak and hoarse, it indicates a fatal condition.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p>
<h4>Febrile Disease Syndrome</h4>
<p>In the case of Taiyang syndrome, when the exterior symptoms have not resolved, if there is water Qi beneath the heart, and the patient has vomiting, fever, and cough, it is appropriate to use Xiao Qinglong Decoction. If there is fever accompanied by vomiting and cough, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction; for Shaoyang syndrome with alternating chills and fever, coughing, fullness in the chest and sides, or diarrhea, modify Xiao Chaihu Decoction by removing the ginseng and jujube, and add Schisandra fruit and dried ginger. For Shaoyin cough, use Zhenwu Decoction; for Shaoyin abdominal pain, difficulty urinating, heaviness in the limbs, and coughing, this is also due to water Qi; modify Zhenwu Decoction with Schisandra fruit, Asarum, and dried ginger.</p>
<h4>Pulse Conditions</h4>
<p>The pulse at the fish margin indicates reverse Qi causing wheezing. If there is coughing and a weak pulse, it will surely lead to distress; a floating and weak pulse is easier to treat. Wheezing and reverse Qi with a rapid pulse indicates heat, making it difficult to lie down, thus hard to treat. If wheezing and coughing are present, along with facial swelling and shoulder breath, a large floating pulse indicates death. If persistent coughing leads to a weak pulse, survival is possible; if the pulse is strong and rapid, it indicates death. If wheezing occurs with either low or high coughing, a slippery pulse, and warm hands and feet, survival is likely. If the pulse is thin and the limbs are cold, it indicates death. If coughing leads to emaciation, with a small, firm, rapid pulse, this indicates a serious condition, and death is expected within fifteen days. Coughing and severe emaciation with a firm, strong pulse indicate death. A pulse that is deep and tight suggests death; a floating and straight pulse suggests survival; a soft floating pulse suggests survival; while a slightly submerged and hidden pulse suggests death. Coughing with vomiting, abdominal fullness, and diarrhea, with a rapid, tight pulse approaching a break indicates death.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Guide</strong> (Ming Dynasty - Gong Xin)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>In treating coughs, the use of Schisandra berries is beneficial as it helps to gather lung energy; it is an essential remedy for heat conditions. However, if there is an external pathogen present, its use should be cautious, as it may trap the pathogenic energy. One must first disperse the pathogen before employing it. The flavor of the Chebula fruit is sour and bitter, capable of astringing and reducing heat. Apricot kernels disperse wind-cold in the lungs, but they should only be used when there is true heat stemming from cold. Mulberry root bark drains lung energy, but it is not purely effective and users should be cautious. Aristolochia can eliminate lung heat while also nourishing the lungs. Fresh ginger is pungent and can promote dispersion. Poppy husks should not be used abruptly; they are meant for later astringent effects. Ginseng can be used when there is qi deficiency or new coughs are associated with weakness; however, it should not be used when there is strong wind-cold or long-standing coughs with stagnant lung fire. Loquat seeds are sweet and can nourish the lungs, moistening and helping to reduce phlegm in the chest.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles - Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>Ming - Zhang Sanxi</strong><br><strong>General Discussion on Coughing</strong>  </p>
<p>The five organs and six bowels, when there is turbid qi, become stagnant and turn into fire, which then inflames the lungs, causing one to cough; thus, the lungs are indeed the overseer. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: the lungs are the canopy of the five organs and six bowels, primarily governing qi. When the distinction between clean and turbid qi is made, there is no cough. If clean qi is not distinguished and turbid qi rises to disturb the canopy, compounded by water and stagnant fluids, the lungs cannot be cleared, resulting in a cough. Furthermore, examining the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: all five organs and six bowels can cause coughing, not just the lungs. Generally speaking, if there is external evil, stagnant fire, and phlegm and fluid attacking upward, with a pulse that is tense and slippery, it indicates a condition that can be treated. However, if one loses blood, and the pulse is hollow and rapid, with tidal fever and a flushed face, and especially if symptoms are severe in the afternoon, it may initially be treatable, but over time, if one becomes emaciated, it becomes hopeless.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing refers to throat clearing; in common terms, it is called a cough. The lungs govern qi, and when evil influences invade the lungs, the qi becomes obstructed and does not descend, resulting in coughing. There are different causes for coughing: some due to lung cold, some due to retained fluids, and some due to pathogenic influences present both exteriorly and interiorly. Each requires different treatments. Coughing from water accumulation presents three signs that must be distinguished. Xiao Qing Long Decoction addresses coughing due to exterior water; Shi Zao Tang addresses coughing due to interior water; Zhen Wu Tang addresses coughing due to yin-related water qi. When water combines with exterior cold and causes coughing, Xiao Qing Long Decoction should induce sweating; when water combines with interior cold and causes coughing, Zhen Wu Tang should warm it; when intestinal disturbances combined with water affect the lungs and lead to coughing, Shi Zao Tang should purgatively treat it.</p>
<p>In cases of Tai Yang disease with body heat and coughing, dry heaving, and diarrhea, Xiao Qing Long Decoction has a method for adjustments. Severe cold and body pain should follow the original formula. If the body feels cool with coughing and dry heaving leads to diarrhea, if there is distention under the heart and pain under the ribs, Shi Zao Tang is indicated. </p>
<p>For heaviness and pain in the limbs, abdominal pain with diarrhea, cough, or vomiting, Zhen Wu Tang has methods for adjustments. </p>
<p>In cases of Shao Yang disease with alternating chills and fever, a tight and painful chest, and coughing, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction has a method for adjustments. </p>
<p>For coughing in Shao Yang, Si Ni Tang is appropriate. If accompanied by abdominal pain and diarrhea, with coughing and fullness leading to vomiting, Da Ban Xia Tang should be used.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br><strong>On the Meaning of the Terms Cough and Coughing</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there are references to both cough and coughing. For example, in the chapters on autumn injuring dampness, one chapter uses just the term &quot;cough,&quot; while another includes &quot;coughing.&quot; This indicates that cough and coughing are essentially the same. The &quot;Jade Machine&quot; distinguishes between yin, yang, qi, and blood, which is an overcomplication. According to the ancient &quot;Essentials of the Machine,&quot; coughing refers to a sound without phlegm, while coughing with phlegm means a sound accompanied by phlegm; if both are present, it is a combination of both. This is a minor distinction in terms, but the interpretation reverses their meanings.</p>
<p>Mr. He of the Bo Zhai states: the discussion of cough and coughing in the &quot;Essentials of the Machine&quot; is indeed a misinterpretation. The lungs govern qi and produce sound. When the lungs are injured by cold fluids, stagnation leads to phlegm, which obstructs the sound trying to ascend; thus, a sound arises from the struggle, and when phlegm is expelled along with sound, it is called cough. When external influences of wind and cold restrain the lung passages, the sound is not efficient, resulting in another kind of sound, which is called coughing. The character for cough (咳) derives from &quot;hai&quot; (亥), which signifies a tangible object, hence things like fruit seeds also derive from &quot;hai.” &quot;Hai&quot; also implies obstruction. The character for coughing (嗽), combines elements meaning to bind and to lack; this reflects the ingenuity of ancient character formation and is the reason these two conditions are differentiated.</p>
<p>Observing this, it indeed seems that the interpretation in the &quot;Essentials of the Machine&quot; is misapplied.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>Coughing is divided into three causes.</p>
<p>Chen Wuze said: Those with coughs due to wind dislike cold and are feverish, have spontaneous sweating and aversion to wind, and experience dry mouth and irritability; those with coughs due to cold dislike cold and have fever, show no sweating and aversion to wind, and feel irritable without thirst; those with coughs due to summer heat experience joint pain, heaviness in the limbs, and profuse sweating. These are external causes. </p>
<p>Persistent coughing due to dysfunction of the internal organs relates to the six bowels, indicating internal causes. If coughing triggers chills and fever, along with pain in the waist and back, or wheezing and fullness, it is due to sexual exhaustion harming the kidneys; if experiencing fullness and bloating in the abdomen, acute heart pain with loss of appetite, it is due to imbalance in eating harming the spleen; if coughing causes pain in the left flank radiating to the lower abdomen, along with pain in the knees and wrists, it is due to extreme fatigue harming the liver; if there is white phlegm with dry mouth and hoarse voice, it is due to shouting harming the lungs; if coughing leads to irritability, sweating, dry throat, and coughing up blood, it is due to mental strain harming the heart. All of these belong to neither purely internal nor external causes.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p>
<h3>Reversal of Coughing</h3>
<p>Chao said: When the lungs are deficient, they are susceptible to slight cold, which leads to coughing. As one coughs, the qi gathers in the lungs, causing them to become distended; this is known as coughing reversal. When evil qi clashes with the righteous qi, the righteous qi cannot disperse and ascends to the throat instead. When the evil is dormant, the qi remains calm; when it becomes active, it rushes upwards, causing anxiety and despair, hence it is called coughing reversal with upward qi.</p>
<h3>Treatment Should Follow the Season</h3>
<p>In the summer, if the cough is hot, it is called a &quot;heat cough,&quot; treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction supplemented with gypsum and Zhimu. In winter, if the cough is accompanied by aversion to cold, it is termed a &quot;cold cough,&quot; treated with Xiao Qing Long Decoction plus apricot kernels and herbs like winter flower, fine xinyi, and dried ginger. Generally, regarding coughs, in spring when the qi rises, &quot;Za Zhu&quot; states it is advisable to moisten the lungs and suppress the liver, using Er Chen Decoction with apricot kernels, Zhimu, Schisandra, Chuanxiong, Baishao, Mai Men Dong, and fried Huangqin. For summer coughs, when fire flares up above, use Er Chen removing Ban Xia plus Wu Wei, Jie Geng, Sang Bai Pi, Di Gu Pi, Mai Men Dong, Huangqin, and gypsum, as well as fritillary bulb. In autumn, if damp heat injures the lungs, one should clear heat and drain dampness, using Er Chen Decoction, removing Ban Xia and adding apricot kernels, Tian Men Dong, Fang Feng, Jie Geng, Cang Zhu, Bai Zhu, Sang Bai Pi, Zhi Zi Ren, and Huangqin. In winter, if the cough is constrained by wind and cold, use dispersing methods; Er Chen Decoction supplemented with Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Jie Geng, and apricot kernels. If there is fever and headache, add Chuanxiong, Xiaobai, Qian Hu, and Chai Hu.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Between Deficiency and Excess, New and Chronic</strong></p>
<p>In general, for those who cough and have weak body energy, using expelling medications is often ineffective; if they do work, the cough will likely return. For such cases, it is advisable to tonify and the cough will naturally resolve. For those with stronger body energy, the cough may be due to external pathogens, and in these instances, it is essential to disperse the evil Qi and break up the stagnation for the cough to calm. New coughs should be treated similarly to those from excess; chronic coughs should be treated with tonifying methods. One may also use harsh medicines to stimulate the sluggish return to health, such as those included in the Jiuxian San.</p>
<p><strong>Caution Against Using Astringent Medicines First</strong></p>
<p>In treating coughs, one must first identify the root cause of the illness and eliminate the evil Qi. Only afterward should one use astringent agents like Wu Mei, He Zi, Wu Wei Zi, poppy husk, and the like, which possess drying and astringent properties, to help constrict and seize. These are necessary and may lead to improvement with just one dose. Care must be taken not to alter the proper order of treatment.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Coughing and Hiccoughing</strong></p>
<p>Hiccoughing is similar to coughing. When there is an abundance of phlegm and fluid in the chest, coughing causes the qi to move within the phlegm, striking between the throat and the phlegm qi; as the coughing starts and stops, it produces sound, which is called hiccoughing. Both Zhongjing and Danxi say: when there’s a sound like that of a water hen in the throat, it can be treated with preparations like Xie Gan Ma Huang Decoction. Generally, it is similar to coughing, but when it comes to administering medicine, one should particularly use substances that resolve phlegm and break down fluids; this is the main difference.</p>
<p><strong>Discourse on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing refers to the presence of sound without phlegm, indicating injury to the lung qi leading to obstructed clarity. Hiccoughing refers to the presence of phlegm without sound, stemming from dampness in the spleen producing phlegm. Coughing and hiccoughing indicates phlegm accompanied by sound, as it originates from lung qi injury, and is influenced by spleen dampness, thus resulting in hiccoughing. The classics say that all five organs and six bowels have coughing; why is it that all organs can be implicated? Coughing is a symptom of disease; it can arise from external invasion or internal causes. External factors include wind, cold, heat, and dampness; internal factors comprise emotional conditions and issues of hunger and satiation. External wind, cold, heat, and dampness first invade through the skin and hair, which is the connection to the lungs; hence, although it&#39;s an external pathogen, it must first encounter this connection to affect the organs and result in hiccoughing, delineating it as an external invasion.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>When the seven emotions cause hunger or satiety and there are internal injuries, then evil qi rises upwards. The lungs serve as the pathway for the entrance and exit of qi, thus the evils of the five organs ascend to the lungs and result in coughing; this is a manifestation from within. However, there are cases of wind, cold, heat, and dampness that do not cause coughing; this is because the affliction is severe and directly injures the organs without affecting the skin. Similarly, the seven emotions may not lead to coughing when the illness is still mild, remaining within the original organ and not attacking upwards. Therefore, in treating cold damage, coughing is considered mild, while coughing caused by the seven emotions due to hunger and satiety may take a long time to manifest.</p>
<p>The treatment should carefully consider the pulse symptoms and the three causes. If the external factor is evil qi, the approach should be to disperse it, while also considering its deficiency or excess, cold or heat. If the internal cause is due to the seven emotions, one should follow the meridian corresponding to the affected area, aligning with the qi and pulse. Priority should be given to smooth the qi, and then address phlegm. If there is retention of fluids causing cough, digestive remedies should be used; one must avoid using drugs like black plum or opium poppy. If the cold evil has not been expelled, one should also refrain from using tonics.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Excessive worry and deep thoughts can lead to injury in the body and ultimately result in a wasting illness; therefore, one should nourish the spleen to support the lungs. The &quot;Ren Zhai Zhi Zhi&quot; states: Those affected by wind will have nasal congestion and a heavy voice, while those harmed by cold will feel sorrowful and fearful of the cold. If heat is present, they will feel intense discomfort; if dampness affects them, they will feel sluggish. Stagnation of blood leads to a sense of heaviness in the chest, while fluid retention causes distension under the heart, which may be either real or false. The color of phlegm can vary, as can the consistency of saliva, which can provide insight into the condition. </p>
<p>The primary methods for treating coughing: if the lung pulse is floating, it&#39;s afflicted by wind; disperse it. If the lung pulse is full, it indicates internal heat due to Qi stagnation; clear it. If the pulse is thin and scattered, it suggests lung deficiency; tonify the lungs to restore balance. For those who have had a prolonged cough and have experienced relief only to worsen, leading to cold in both the lungs and stomach, where food cannot be ingested, one should apply warming herbs to assist the stomach and use balanced remedies to treat the cough.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>As for excessive indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures, it leads to virtual depletion of blood, internal consumption of fluids, and self-ignition of heart fire. Consequently, dryness and heat invade the lungs, causing sputum mixed with pus and blood, and resulting in persistent coughing. It is only through nourishing the blood to support the muscles that one can prevent external pathogens from easily entering the lungs. Hence, ginseng, angelica, and chuanxiong should not be overlooked. </p>
<p>In cases of illness involving malevolent factors and counteraction of the five organs, the toxins are particularly deep. In recent times, substances such as the crown of the head, gecko, branches of peach and willow, cinnabar, realgar, frankincense, and suhexiang pills are often employed to communicate with the spirit. Therefore, in the treatment of cough, one can seek guidance here; nevertheless, further discussion is warranted.</p>
<p>The lungs are responsible for the release of qi, while the kidneys control its intake. The lungs are the master of qi, and the kidneys are the foundation. If one experiences a severe cough accompanied by a sensation of qi rising from below the navel, it indicates that the kidneys are deficient and unable to gather qi properly. Thus, one should use medicine like the Bogu Zhi An Shen Wan to strengthen the kidneys, rather than focusing solely on soothing the lungs.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Treating Coughs</strong> </p>
<p>Coughing refers to the sound without phlegm, while a &quot;sough&quot; is with phlegm and sound. Although it differentiates among the six organs and five viscera, the main concern is always the lungs. The lungs are the organ of clear and empty, unable to hold even a small amount; a light tickle can trigger a cough. Furthermore, the lungs are delicate and sensitive to heat and cold; excessive heat causes coughing, while cold can also induce it. Therefore, when someone coughs, the lungs must be held accountable. </p>
<p>However, the treatment approach is not exclusively focused on the lungs but also involves the spleen, ultimately returning to emphasize the kidneys. The spleen is the mother of the lungs, and the kidneys are the child of metal; therefore, if there is deficiency, one should nourish the mother, and if there is excess, one should drain the child. </p>
<p>For example, if a cough arises from an external invasion of wind-cold, modern treatments often involve herbs like Ephedra, Bitter Orange, and Perilla to disperse the exterior pathogens, theorizing that if the illness starts from the exterior, it must also exit through the exterior. If both form and qi are robust, often a sweat can remedy the issue. However, if the form and qi are slightly deficient, it is best to prioritize tonifying the spleen while also assisting with herbs that release the exterior. </p>
<p>Why is this? The lungs govern the skin and hair; if they are deficient, the pores will not be tightly sealed, making it easy for wind pathogens to enter. If the lungs are not deficient, how could pathogens enter? Hence, the ancients included ginseng in the Ginseng and Perilla Decoction and added peony and licorice in the Cinnamon Twig Decoction, combining exterior-releasing herbs with those that fortify the spleen. When the spleen is strong, the lung metal has nourishment, and the skin has defense; any invading pathogens are easily expelled, preventing further invasions.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>If the treatment focuses solely on the surface, then the lung qi becomes more deficient, and the pores become more lax. When external pathogens take advantage of this, when will it ever cease? One must use ginseng, astragalus, and licorice to replenish the spleen, along with cinnamon twig to drive away evils. This I say is treating the spleen rather than the lung; when deficient, one supplements its mother. The &quot;Ren Zhai Zhi Zhi&quot; states: The lung expels qi; the kidney receives qi. The lung is the master of qi, while the kidney is the root of qi. In cases of sudden, severe cough that causes disturbance in the body, with the sensation of qi rising from the lower abdomen upwards, this indicates kidney deficiency unable to contain qi. The treatments should focus on the Earth Yellow Pill or the An Kidney Pill, not merely on the lung. This is the principle of supplementing the child when there is deficiency of the mother. Furthermore, I have another statement. Among the five elements, only the lung and kidney are involved, where the mother becomes strong and the child suffers from evil.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>What is it? The lung governs qi. If the lung has heat, the qi becomes heated and rises, unable to descend to nourish the kidney, and thus the kidney becomes afflicted by pathogens. Once the kidney is affected, the lung&#39;s condition worsens. Why is this so? It is because the mother houses the child, and the child is hidden within the mother’s womb. In humans, the lung, which is of metal qi, returns to be stored in the kidney’s water at night when lying down. Now, if the lung suffers from the evil of heart fire, and attempts to descend to avoid the water, but the kidney&#39;s water is dried up, there is no place for the fire to reside, which leads to it rising again and causing illness. </p>
<p>Those with fire burning the lung metal, leading to cough, should clear metal and lower fire. In current medical texts, those discussing the clearing of metal and lowering of fire suggest using Scutellaria, Ophiopogon, and Morus alba to clear lung metal, while Coptis is used to lower heart fire, gypsum to reduce stomach fire, and herbs like Four Substance Decoction, Phellodendron, and Anemarrhena to reduce yin fire; they also recommend using Zhi (bitter orange) and Banxia (pinellia) to dispel yin damage, favoring the use of Fritillaria, (Baihe) lily, bamboo juice, and loquat leaves to moisten the lung and transform phlegm. Are these treatment methods not straightforward and reasonable? Little do they know that the rationale for clearing metal and lowering fire seems correct but is, in fact, mistaken.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>To supplement the north, is precisely to drain the south; to nourish its yin is to decrease the fire. Do we not observe how the master of water, Qi Yuanzi, conquers the yang light? In my discussions on fire theory and the nourishing yin and descending fire theory, I have already detailed the inappropriateness of using herbs like Huangbo and Zhimu, along with the harms of cold and cooling medicines. I have more to say. Wang Jiezhai states that excessive alcohol and colors harm the true yin of the lungs and kidneys; therefore, one should not take Ren Shen (Ginseng) or Huang Qi (Astragalus) excessively, as it could lead to death, fearing that the yang may become too strong and the yin may diminish. Since this view took hold, those treating yin deficiency coughs regard Ren Shen and Huang Qi as poison, turning to Huangbo and Zhimu as miraculous elixirs, leading those afflicted to take these medicines with nearly no chance of recovery—which is truly tragic. Those who can restrain desires and avoid medications can often prolong their lives. It can be seen that the disease is not untreatable, but rather that the treatment methods are improper. The disease fundamentally arises from excessive sexual exertion, which depletes the true yin. When the yin is deficient, the fire rises; when the fire rises, it harms metal, resulting in cough, which inevitably damages metal further. I first use medicines that bolster the master of water, like Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill), to replenish the true yin, allowing water to rise and fire to descend; then I utilize lung-nourishing medicines, such as Ren Shen and Huang Qi, to supplement the mother of the kidneys, creating a cycle where metal and water support each other, thus facilitating recovery from illness. Those who use cold and cooling methods are shallow and mediocre; they need not be mentioned. Occasionally, there are those who know to use Ren Shen and Huang Qi, yet do not recognize the necessity to first bolster water to restrain fire, hastily using Ren Shen and Huang Qi to supplement the yang, which only strengthens the yang fire further, causing even more harm to metal. Is it truly the fault of the medicine? This is what we refer to as the failure to recognize the proper order.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>When the spleen and stomach are initially deficient, the earth is unable to control water; water overflows and turns into phlegm, causing the child to seize the mother and cough. Also, if the condition starts from heart fire attacking metal due to mistakenly consuming cold substances, it can injure the spleen, further weakening the lungs and resulting in cough. This involves the position of fire being below, with water qi supporting it, leading the child to rescue the mother, as kidney water regains the fire&#39;s offense. Cold water, mixed with the wood force, ascends to invade the lungs and stomach, hence the cough arises from cold water affecting metal. If the previous illness is not resolved, the new illness worsens. If a rough practitioner does not understand this principle, they might wrongly believe that phlegm-fire is hard to eliminate and that cold must be increased, which could be dangerous! At this time, one must use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger to nourish the spleen and lungs, and the Eight Treasure Pill to supplement the earth mother, guiding water back to its source. These are methods for treating cough, and I hope fellow practitioners lend their thoughts to this! The &quot;Essentials of the Golden Chamber&quot; states: &quot;When there is cough and wheezing, with a watery sound in the throat, use the She Gan Ma Huang Decoction to treat it.&quot;<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>This discussion addresses cases where there is a cough accompanied by a hoarse voice. It suggests that when the lungs are strong, they emit sounds; when they are compromised, they do not. Strengthening the lungs is achieved through cleansing and supporting. Furthermore, one must understand that the Shaoyin channel enters the lungs, traveling along the throat and involving the root of the tongue. If the lungs are weak (the &quot;marker&quot;), then the voice becomes disordered, leading to difficulty in speaking and a withered tongue, as mentioned in Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s writings on febrile diseases. </p>
<p>There was a man over fifty years old who suffered from a febrile disease and cough, producing a sound resembling wheezing in his throat. After taking a dose of Ginseng Decoction, the wheezing sound ceased, and after two or three doses, the cough gradually diminished; after taking two or three pounds, he was completely cured.</p>
<p>There are also cases of dry coughs, which Danxi observes are particularly hard to treat. This is attributed to stagnant fire, indicating internal phlegm and its accompanying fire pathogen. Using Xiaoyao Powder helps to resolve it, followed by the administration of nourishing yin ingredients for recovery.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br><strong>On Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The condition of coughing, when sought in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; is broad yet lacks key points; when sought in the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; it merely associates the five elements with phlegm and drinks afterward, yet presents no profound discussions. Unable to avoid consulting the sages of later generations, the so-called precious gems do not lack thorough examination in the literature, but ultimately, each speaks their own sound and rarely converge. If I do not pass down vague and ephemeral ideas to later generations, what words shall I convey? I have often revisited the texts of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: &quot;What causes coughing in the lungs?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;All five organs can cause coughing; it is not solely the lungs.&quot; This one statement opens up the discussion on lung coughing but seems to cover too broadly. If the topic of lung coughing had been initially presented in a gradual, detailed manner, there would be no doubts, and later generations would have established methods to follow. However, the sages merely expressed ideas that followed the text closely, slightly hinting at the beginnings. If one must consider every detail uniformly, it deviates from the essence only to fragment the discourse. Thus, reading the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; emphasizes grasping its key points. If one grasps the essence, a single statement suffices; if not, it splinters endlessly—how could this not apply specifically to the condition of coughing? The Yellow Emperor&#39;s directive to Lei Gong states: &quot;Not knowing to classify can lead to confusion, and can impede clarity.&quot;<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>It is well known that the method of analogy not only suffices to obscure the meanings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; but also to obscure the ultimate nature of the infinite and boundless. A tube can glimpse the heavens, and a gourd can measure the sea; the myriad texts of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; though extensive, can be comprehended and unified through a single analogy. As for the harsh illnesses that arise, they can be managed with ease, no further discussion is necessary. </p>
<p>Let us elaborate. Although Qi Bo mentions that all the five organs and six bowels can cause coughing, the primary focus is on the lungs. He later explains that the skin and hair are associated with the lungs. The skin and hair are the first to receive harmful qi; this evil qi enters through their connection. Cold food and drink, when affecting the stomach, travel through the stomach meridian to the lungs, causing the lungs to become cold; when the lungs are cold, the internal and external connect, allowing the evil to invade, resulting in a cough. This illustrates one aspect of how cold food and drink harm the lungs and clarifies the cause of coughs.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;internal and external evil combine&quot; is pivotal in the method of analogy, emphasizing its importance. The human body can have external evils, internal evils, evils that are both internal and external, external evils that have departed but internal evils that remain, and internal evils that have been resolved but external evils that are not yet cleared. By employing a single analogy, everything becomes clear and understandable. Why then do we fail to discern such matters early on, allowing them to worsen day by day?</p>
<p>As for external cold, it is the result of being affected by wind-cold; cold drinking is an internal injury caused by food and drink. When the formless evil of wind-cold enters the body and combines with the formless evil of food and drink, it will inevitably linger. Treating the external evil must be done externally; the internal evil must be expelled from below, yet they should not be treated together at the same time.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>In the &quot;Golden Casket,&quot; the five directions ultimately do not stray from the formula of Xiao Qing Long Tang for adjustments, as discussed in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; with its corresponding formulas found in the &quot;Golden Casket.&quot; However, what is absent in both the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and the &quot;Golden Casket&quot; must be derived through comparisons; whence do we turn for this? Further investigation into summer heat and dampness reveals that these evils can provoke coughing. Indeed, when external pathogens infiltrate due to summer heat and dampness, they must combine with the inherent heat pathogenic forces, worsening the cough; therefore, it is advisable to resolve this with acrid and cooling remedies while also adapting the example of Xiao Qing Long Tang into Bai Hu Tang, incorporating elements like Tian Shui and Wu Ling.</p>
<p>Delving deeper into the aspect of fire, we can observe the complementary relationship between the sovereign and minister, apart from the internal and external interactions, which can frequently lead to coughing. Since the heart and lung coexist in the diaphragm, the heat of the heart can easily suppress the metal of the lung. However, the fire of the sovereign does not act proactively; it remains unyielding and, at times, exerts effort that leads to coughing, but ceasing heart activity naturally alleviates the coughing, thus not resulting in catastrophic situations. It is only when the ministerial fire rises and carries the sovereign&#39;s heat that it severely afflicts the lung, creating the most significant problems. To treat this, one might also draw parallels with examples from external and internal combined evils, controlling or redirecting the heat from below, effectively preventing widespread calamity.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>Coughing in the chest is a nuisance, caused by the reversal of kidney energy, which is influenced by the邪 (evil) disrupting the balance of the upper and lower parts of the body. However, the turbid yin qi rises and obstructs the clear yang, blocking the diaphragm and preventing the release of this disturbance. By driving down the turbid yin, the cough can naturally cease. </p>
<p>Furthermore, seeking a solution in dryness, there are no fixed attributes for the internal and external, upper and lower. It may be due to excessive sweating or vomiting leading to fluids leaking outward, or prolonged diarrhea depleting the yin. It could also result from deficient blood failing to nourish the muscles, or the essence and marrow being exhausted and unable to fill the bones, leading to the lungs becoming dry and the fire invading without restraint, causing an unending cough. At this time, it is crucial to generate fluids, nourish the blood, and replenish the essence. This can still be managed. </p>
<p>Failure to treat this will result in a dire condition: the vessel will be dry, cup emptied, hair and skin withered, muscles tense and nails brittle; coughing will cause pain in the chest and back, leading to discomfort in the sides, various qi stagnations, weakness, shortness of breath, vomiting; a sore throat with blood discharge, and various dangerous symptoms appearing in succession. What remedy can help nourish this scorched dryness? </p>
<p>The ancient texts state that continuous coughing with white blood indicates death; is this not due to the lung suffering from the dry heat and decaying, with the blood transforming into a paler hue? As for the coughs of the five organs and six bowels, the Inner Canon does not fully explain them; yet one can compare and connect their principles. The knowledge of an individual is limited; based only on cold, damp, and dry fire injuring the lungs and making broad comparisons, only provides a rough framework to stimulate understanding, while delving into the fundamental principles demands the efforts of future generations.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>Continuation of the Discussion</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion on cough by Chang, comparing it to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; I find it insufficient and am not at ease. Therefore, I took the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; to ponder over, tirelessly throughout the day, and eventually came to a realization. I began to understand that the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; mentions cough in relation to phlegm and fluids, which holds profound significance. This is because cough must stem from phlegm and fluids, and among the five types of fluids, only the upper diaphragm fluid serves as the primary foundation for cough. When external pathogens enter and combine with it, they certainly provoke a cough; even without external pathogens, if the upper diaphragm fluid seeps into the lungs, it alone can cause persistent coughing. Moreover, if the upper diaphragm fluid is retained for a long time, the vital energy from the lower region may reverse and surge upward, making it even easier for external pathogens to combine with internal issues. Thus, due to the presence of upper diaphragm fluid, external pathogens can penetrate inward, and lower issues can rise; if the upper diaphragm fluid is not eliminated, the cough will never find tranquility. To dispel the upper diaphragm fluid, one should use the Ten Jujube Decoction, regardless of its potency. This applies not only at the onset of illness but also when the affliction has been prolonged; it is essential not to seek any alternative remedies. It is said: for those who cough, their pulse is taut and indicates the presence of fluid; the Ten Jujube Decoction is indicated for this. It rightly asserts that a tight pulse must urgently address the elimination of upper diaphragm fluid, which is easy to understand.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>It is said: If a person has a phlegm disorder, with a cough and chest pain, they do not die immediately. After one hundred days or a year, a decoction of ten dates is suitable; this can allow one to live despite their condition, effectively removing the phlegm. Is it not alarming and doubtful? Among people, who does not have phlegm in their chest? How is its harm so severe? Why must its removal require such effort? The diaphragm is governed by Yang energy, with the heart and lungs residing there. When phlegm obstructs this area, coughing occurs with lung movement, and agitation of the heart causes distress, leading to pain. When it presses on the interior, the nourishing and protective energies cannot flow, the spirit loses its anchor, resulting in sudden death. After one hundred days or a year without death, it is clear that Yang energy has not dispersed, and the spirit has not departed. Therefore, one must urgently remove the evil to stabilize the body&#39;s rightful condition; thus, the rigorous attacks are justified. By eliminating the Yin dampness, clarity can be restored. Compared to merely waiting for death, what is gained or lost? It is said: If a cough lasts for several years and the pulse is weak, it can be treated; if the pulse is significantly weak, death is certain. If the pulse is vacuous, one will suffer from the condition because the phlegm is inherently present in the chest. Treatment pertains to phlegm disorders. To treat the cough without addressing the phlegm reflects a hidden intention of Zhang Zhongjing that subtly reveals itself with a single thought. In fact, significant weakness results in an inability to control fire, leading to death.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>Its weakness and emptiness are such that both the邪 and the正 are declining and can easily recover; hence it can be healed. It is said: If there is cough and shortness of breath, preventing lying down, Xiao Qing Long Decoction is the main remedy. This clarifies the signs of external and internal combined邪, with Xiao Qing Long being suitable for one specific condition. However, when using Xiao Qing Long Decoction, it must be noted that there is profound significance in its application; care must be taken to prevent excessive upward counterflow, which can greatly increase chaos and turbidity. If excessive upward conflict and turbidity arise, the cough cannot be tolerated. For injuries from cold, Da Qing Long Decoction is used; those without signs of Shaoyin can take it, while those with a faint and weak pulse should not, as it may cause the flesh to tremble and the tendons to shiver, leading to the loss of Yang. For mixed conditions, Xiao Qing Long Decoction is also employed, yet there are concerns that the Shaoyin kidney Qi is fundamentally weak, making it easy for the fire of the Chong and Ren meridians to reverse upward. When the Chong and Ren fire ascend, there is no cough but the increase of vexation and cough; moreover, with a prolonged cough, can one stir the upward counterflow? Indeed, the Chong and Ren meridians, along with the large network of the kidneys, originate from below the kidneys and emerge from within the womb. If the kidney is weak and cannot properly anchor below, the two meridians become constrained, pushing upward from the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Then, using Guìlìng Wǔwèi Gāncǎo Táng, first treat the counterflow qi. When the counterflow qi is low, but there is still coughing and chest fullness, it is because water is not dispersing in the diaphragm. If the condition changes again, remove the cassia and add dried ginger and asarum to treat the coughing fullness, which will then cease. Upon the third change, if there is renewed thirst and the counterflow qi reoccurs, treat with asarum and dried ginger as hot medicines, as this will initially cause thirst, but if the thirst subsides, it indicates a condition called Zhi Yin. The treatment for Zhi Yin should include emesis, which will necessarily lead to vomiting; for the vomit, take Ban Xia to eliminate the water, which will stop the vomiting once the water has been expelled. </p>
<p>Upon the fourth change, if the person appears swollen, it indicates that water remains on the surface, so add apricot kernels to address this. The symptoms suggest administering Ma Huang internally; however, since the person is experiencing blockages, it should not be administered internally. If administered contrary to this, it will certainly lead to counterflow. This happens because the person is blood deficient, and Ma Huang promotes its yang. </p>
<p>Upon the fifth change, if the face is hot like one who is drunk, this indicates stomach heat rising up to the face, and the addition of Da Huang will help to relieve this. Ah! Zhongjing&#39;s treatment of cough is entirely not derived from the cough itself, but rather aims to dispel Zhi Yin, reduce the counterflow qi, and thereby address the methods related to counterflow qi. The approach is accomplished effortlessly, completely resolving the issue. Isn’t it miraculous? Previously, one could not grasp the author&#39;s intent and felt there was no elevation to be achieved. Who would have expected that by making comparisons, one could discover the interaction between external pathogens and internal issues, stemming from the principles outlined in the &quot;Jīng Kuì&quot;? The essence and insights are truly profound, could they not have been revealed by divine inspiration? How comforting! How comforting!<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br><strong>Miscellaneous Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that in autumn, one is harmed by dampness, and in winter, coughing arises. This is a misrepresentation that has been passed down through the ages; I will correct it now. It says: Summer is harmed by heat; the long summer is harmed by dampness, leading to autumn inevitably experiencing fevers and chills. If autumn is harmed by dryness, coughing will arise in winter. The principle of the six qi corresponding to the four seasons is clearly elucidated. Dampness is linked to water, while dryness relates to fire. Damp diseases must stem from spring and summer, whereas dry diseases are more pronounced in autumn and winter. Fevers and chills are clearly symptoms of the combination of summer heat and dampness; yet dampness is more pronounced than heat. Why is it overlooked and not mentioned? As for coughing, it is entirely due to the manifestation of fire and dryness; why then is it considered a harm from dampness? Thus, in spring and summer, when there is much dampness, after the spring equinox, the earth&#39;s qi rises while the heavens&#39; qi falls, and the two energies interact, leading to dampness steaming within. The soil becomes moist and rich with water, and the human body responds to this, resulting in the manifestation of damp diseases.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>In autumn and winter, when many suffer from dryness-related illnesses, after the autumn equinox, the weather does not cool down, and the earth&#39;s energy does not rise. The two energies separate, manifesting dryness; the grass turns yellow, trees shed leaves, mountains become rugged, and waters dry up. The human body responds to this, and dryness-related ailments appear. Thus, it is clear that coughs caused by dryness are indeed a manifestation of this condition!</p>
<p>The six qi (energies) govern illnesses: wind, fire, heat, humidity, dryness, and cold all affect the lungs and can lead to coughing. Coughing due to humidity is classified within the five energies of wind, fire, heat, dryness, and cold. Coughing due to wind brings sweating and headaches, with phlegm not flowing freely; coughing due to fire brings wheezing, urgency, and possibly blood in nasal discharge; coughing due to heat leads to wheezing, red face, tidal fever, and in severe cases, extreme heat internally while the extremities feel cold, causing uncontrollable diarrhea; coughing due to dryness results in dry skin, small itchy sores, and constipation; coughing due to cold causes chills with no sweating, nasal congestion, body aches, and irritability.</p>
<p>As for coughing caused by damp phlegm internally, it must be due to the influence of wind, fire, heat, dryness, or cold, with each case having different characteristics. However, the effect on the lungs remains the same.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>When experiencing wind-cold externally binding, use Huagai San and Shen Su Decoction; if the sound doesn&#39;t come out due to wind-evil, use Ginseng and Jingjie Decoction; for cold-evil, use San Yao Decoction; if coughing occurs when meeting cold, use Tangerine Peel and Pinellia Decoction.</p>
<p>For fire-heat burning internally, adjust and use Xie Bai San or Water-boiled Golden Flower Pill; if the body feels hot like being scorched, use Purple Aster Paste.</p>
<p>For cough due to injury from summer heat, characterized by spontaneous sweating, weak pulse, and thirst, use Ginseng Baihu Decoction or Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>For cough from injury due to dampness, with heaviness, fine pulse, and much phlegm, use Wu Ling San or Bai Zhu Decoction; if there&#39;s wheezing, fullness, and swelling, use Kuanqi Pill; if damp-heat has been retained internally, use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction or Gun Tan Pill; if damp-heat is retained above and there&#39;s a continuous inability to breathe, use Sangbai Pi San.</p>
<p>For cough from dryness, with sticky phlegm causing adverse reactions and blood-tinged, use Apricot Kernel and Radish Seed Pill; to clear metal and moisten dryness, use Tianmendong Pill or Feng Sui Decoction; if there is facial and body swelling, use Honey and Suet Decoction.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>Coughs caused by internal injuries vary in treatment: when fire is strong and water is deficient, support metal and strengthen earth; when obstruction is severe, soothe the liver; when qi is rebellious, regulate the lungs; when food accumulates, harmonize the center; for sexual exhaustion, replenish the lower; use warmth for heat and cold to counter cold. If internal injury has already occurred, avoid harsh medicines. For cold and deficient upper burner with nausea and saliva, use warm boiling decoction; if both upper and middle burners are deficient, use modified Li Zhong Decoction; if all three burners are deficient, use modified San Cai Decoction.</p>
<p>For coughs resulting from kidney damage, with rebellious qi and discomfort in the waist and abdomen, unable to bend or straighten, use Liu Wei Di Huang Decoction plus Schisandra; if water and cold collaborate internally causing abdominal pain and diarrhea, use Zhen Wu Decoction; if there is a dry cough with heat affecting the large intestine, which also causes abdominal pain and diarrhea, careful differentiation is crucial.</p>
<p>For coughs due to both Ying and Wei deficiency, with deficient Ying causing fever and deficient Wei leading to spontaneous sweating or aversion to cold, use Ning Fei Decoction. For coughs from deficiency due to overwork, use Wu Wei Huang Qi San or Mai Men Dong Drink. </p>
<p>If heart fire injures the lungs and there is blood in the sputum, use Ren Shen Qiong Gui Decoction.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>Dry cough without phlegm, heat blocking internally, treat with the Four Herbs and Platycodon Decoction; injury from excessive alcohol leading to heat accumulation, use Qiongyu Paste for moistening. Excessive sexual desire causes kidney water to not rise, treat with Eight-flavor Pill. </p>
<p>For a cough that is more prominent in the first half of the day, heat is in the Yang, use White Tiger Decoction; if more prominent in the latter half, heat is in the Yin, use Four Herbs with Scutellaria and Lian Decoction. </p>
<p>Chronic cough damages the lungs, leading to lung atrophy, with blood seen in phlegm, tidal fever and raspy sound, use Ginseng Nourishing Lung Decoction; for blood-tinged coughing and fatigue, use Zhongru Supplementing Lung Decoction; for chronic cough requiring consolidation, use Ginseng Clearing Lung Decoction; if sound does not emerge, use Tsahezi Powder.</p>
<p>Cough induced by rich foods, typically treated as damp-heat accumulating internally. If excessive sexual desire depletes vital energy, one must not fully attack the phlegm. Cough induced by spicy or bitter foods, treated as externally contracted wind-cold. If external cold envelops internal heat, one must differentiate the amounts of cold and heat and apply methods for treating both inside and out.</p>
<p>Question: If autumn injuries through dampness cause upward coughing and result in atrophy and nocturnal emissions, is this different from injuries in winter affecting the kidneys and those in spring causing atrophy? Answer: This atrophy due to autumn injuries differs greatly from that in spring. Autumn injuries through dampness have been clearly identified as causing dryness.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>When harmed by dryness, the lungs are the first to be affected. Coughing is the primary illness of the lungs, with various manifestations. If the cough rises up, it is a sign of dryness. If it leads to weakness, it indicates that the lung metal is depleted by the liver wood; if it leads to a blockage, it means the lung qi is reversed and doesn&#39;t circulate, resulting in extreme dryness. This is due to internal heat from dryness, where metal does not cool and water does not chill, which means autumn and winter cannot store up, just as spring cannot flourish—it is indeed quite distant from each other! </p>
<p>Coughing from external influences is caused by the six evils, which can accumulate and turn into fire due to the interaction of the six evils. When they internally harm the five organs and the five pathogens clash, it creates different conditions. Furthermore, there are methods of contraction and dispersal: contraction refers to gathering lung qi; dispersal refers to dispersing cold evils. If dispersal is needed but contraction occurs, then the lung&#39;s cold evil is confined for a time, causing significant harm. Conversely, if contraction is needed but dispersal happens, the lung&#39;s qi becomes weak and scatters, allowing righteous qi to leak out, which is harmful as well. </p>
<p>For instance, if a cough from wind has already dispersed and the surface is weak, if cold evil is reintroduced, the interaction of the weakened and evil forces can lead to wheezing. If you wish to disperse the wind, it may worsen the weakness in the lungs; if you wish to contract, it may worsen the stagnation of the evil. Therefore, one should first lightly disperse and then gradually contract, so the lungs do not become weak, and the evil does not become stagnant, thus stopping the wheezing and cough on its own. </p>
<p>This concludes the six guidelines.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>In treating coughs, one must distinguish between external causes and internal injuries, as well as differentiate between deficiency and excess, new and chronic conditions. Using cooling medicines with only a slight dispersing effect may seem negligent and lead to severe complications; this is something a good physician should avoid.</p>
<p>When treating a cough resulting from yin deficiency with excessive fire and dryness coupled with little phlegm, using Er Chen Decoction indiscriminately may injure the yin and lead to a serious condition—this is the physician&#39;s fault.</p>
<p>In cases where cough and diarrhea occur simultaneously, if one does not pay attention, those with weakened middle qi often have a high mortality rate; thus, should such individuals die, it is the physician’s responsibility.</p>
<p>This condition may involve both lung heat and kidney cold, as water and fire differ; regardless of whether to use cooling or warming treatments, the primary focus must be on protecting the middle qi.</p>
<p>When the evil is strong and cough is frequent, one must never use strong purgatives. If a cough persists while the evil weakens, only then can mild treatments be applied. Mismanagement may harm the lungs and lead to uncontrollable coughing, resulting in a passive waiting for death; this is the responsibility of the physician.</p>
<p>In cases of cough associated with pulmonary atrophy or abscess, mistakenly diagnosing it as deficiency and improperly nourishing yin and blood can hinder phlegm clearance, leading to a fatal outcome—this is the physician’s fault.</p>
<p>For coughs that progress to elevated qi and sweating, one should not wait for urgent symptoms like wheezing or phlegm sounds but must promptly address the underlying issue. If one continues to treat superficial symptoms without addressing the root cause, it will inevitably lead to a collapse of qi and sudden death; this is the physician’s fault.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing is a symptom that I have observed various scholars complicate with excessive arguments, leading to confusion for future generations in diagnosing and treating it. From my perspective, the essence of coughing can be distilled into two main categories: external causes and internal injuries. </p>
<p>What are these two categories? First, there is external aggression; second, there is internal deficiency, and that is all there is to it. Coughing due to external causes must originate from the skin and hair, as these are connected to the lungs. When external pathogens invade, they must first enter through the lungs. If the condition persists and does not improve, it will eventually affect the five internal organs. </p>
<p>Coughing due to internal injury arises primarily from the deficiency of the yin. The lungs are associated with dryness (metal) and are the source of water. When the yin is depleted from below, the yang is left isolated above; this results in dryness affecting the lungs. When the lungs are dry, they become itchy, leading to persistent coughing. </p>
<p>In summary, although there are many types of coughs, they ultimately stem from lung issues, which can be categorized into these two types. However, it is essential to differentiate between yin and yang and to discern between deficiency and excess. External coughing is attributed to yang pathogens, which enter from the outside; therefore, treatment should involve warming and dispersing, allowing the pathogens to scatter. Conversely, internal coughing is due to yin deficiency, where the yin energy is impaired from within; in this case, treatment should focus on sweet and neutral substances that nourish the yin, enabling the cough to resolve. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, if there is an excess of external pathogens involved, even within an internal deficiency, treatment should involve a combination of nourishment and dispersion.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>In the case of internal injuries, many ailments are insufficient; if there&#39;s a deficiency that includes a fullness, it should also be addressed with clarity and moisture. Generally, the causes of coughing stem from this; by seeking it here, one obtains the root, making treatment responsive. How can there be confusion like the ten cough syndromes of the Chao family or the three causes of cough of the Chen family, which only serve to confuse people&#39;s minds and provide no relief? Those who pay attention will understand this meaning well. </p>
<p>The classics say: the lungs cause coughing. They also state: the five organs and six bowels can all cause coughing; it is not only the lungs. Furthermore, it is said: the skin and hair first receive the pathogenic energy, which combines with the harmony. It is also mentioned that each of the five organs suffers illnesses at their appointed times, and not all can transfer their conditions to each other simultaneously. Therefore, when coughing arises from the five organs, it is transmitted through the lungs, making the lungs the primary organ while the others are supplementary. Thus, the five organs and six bowels each have their signs, distinguished by their accompanying symptoms. </p>
<p>When there are accompanying symptoms, there should also be combined treatments. Even with combined treatments, the emphasis remains on the lungs, which is self-evident. However, there still remains a viewpoint. It suggests that coughing due to external pathogens and coughing due to internal injuries have different origins and require different treatments. In external coughs, the onset is in the lungs, thus it must arise from the lungs to the other organs, making the lungs the source and the other organs the signs. In internal coughs, the initial cause is the injury to the other organs; therefore, it must arise from the other organs to affect the lungs, with the other organs as the source and the lungs as the sign.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>To treat internal injuries, one must not only focus on the lungs without understanding how to treat other organs; otherwise, how can the true yin be restored? Without the restoration of yin, the cough will never heal. When treating external conditions, one must not neglect the yang and mistakenly treat the yin; otherwise, how can the evil qi be resolved? If the evil is not dispelled, the cough will remain unrelieved. The classics state: to treat illness, one must seek its root. Why is it that modern people cannot discern this?</p>
<p>Regarding the labor wind syndrome, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that the treatment for heat-related illness requires attention to the lungs. This condition causes people to feel weak, with cloudy vision, and phlegm that resembles mucus, alongside an aversion to wind and chills; this is the disease of labor wind. Those who are robust recover in three days, middle-aged individuals in five days, and the weak in seven days. Coughing up green and yellow phlegm that appears like pus and is as large as a pellet, emerging from the mouth as if from the nose; if it does not come out, it harms the lungs, and lung damage will lead to death.</p>
<p>Labor wind syndrome refers to the effects of overexertion leading to wind exposure. People who exert themselves will have their pores open and sweat to flow, making it easy for wind evil to invade. Many modern cases of wind-injury present this syndrome. Thus, those with mild cases recover in three to four days, while severe cases take five to seven days, ultimately expelling turbid phlegm like mucus before healing, which indeed belongs to the category of labor wind. However, if treated according to the methods for external conditions, recovery is assured.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>Those who are greatly fatigued may either exhaust their essence internally or strain their form externally. When the fatigue becomes severe, both essence and blood will inevitably deplete, which prevents the evil from dispersing and phlegm from being expelled; this is akin to the cough caused by excessive labor, thus often proving difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Coughing can arise from external pathogens as well as from internal injuries; one condition is real, the other is虚 (deficient), so treatment must be discerning. Cough due to external pathogens is usually caused by an exposure to wind and cold, leading to symptoms that may include chills and fever, or breathlessness, nasal congestion with a heavy sound, headaches, and phlegm. If the evil is light, the pulse will be harmonious and gentle, while if it is severe, the pulse may become wiry, rapid, or weak. However, if there are no prior signs of chronic fatigue or depletion, and an acute cough arises suddenly, it indicates an external pathogen.</p>
<p>In contrast, cough resulting from internal injury tends to develop gradually, possibly due to indulgence in alcohol and sensual pleasures or due to fatigue; it generally starts with a slight cough that becomes increasingly severe over time.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>The symptoms may include night fevers and heat sensations, weight loss, persistent redness in both cheeks, shortness of breath, dry throat, and a pulse that is either light and rapid or thin and tight. Coughs due to external factors appear suddenly, while those from internal deficiencies develop gradually. Coughs caused by external factors are due to cold evils, whereas those from internal injuries arise from Yin deficiency. External coughs may be treated with warming or dispersing methods, making them easier to manage; internal coughs require tonification and harmonization, which complicates their treatment. This is the distinction to be made. However, there are cases where individuals with weak pulses suddenly contract external illnesses, and strong individuals may suffer from internal injuries. In these ambiguous situations, one should closely observe the cause of illness and pulse characteristics to discern the appropriate responses. If one misdiagnoses the condition and treats it incorrectly, it could lead to serious consequences, so caution is advised.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for External Cough Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>External coughs occur at any time and are fundamentally caused by cold evils. Cold follows the seasonal climate and invades the lungs, so the treatment for coughs is to use warm excitants to disperse the evils, with Liugan Decoction plus fresh ginger being the most effective. For all cases of external afflictions, it is essential to use this decoction, adjusted as necessary. If there is dryness in the lung area with phlegm and air not flowing well, or if the patient is elderly or blood is deficient causing difficulty in coughing, add two to three qian of angelica root to this formula. If cold evils are too intense or if the lung qi is not warm enough to dispel the evils, add seven to eight fen or one qian of northern fine herb to this formula. If in winter when the cold is severe and qi is blocked, making it hard to disperse the evils, add ephedra and cinnamon twig or use Xiao Qing Long Decoction.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>If one suffers from a wind injury with cold, or a cold injury with wind, accompanied by alternating chills and fever, and a persistent cough, it is advisable to use a decoction of Chai Chen as the primary treatment. If the cold pathogen is not severe and the phlegm and qi are not abundant, simply adjusting the Er Chen Tang will suffice for treatment, and there will be no lack of cures.</p>
<p>Coughs caused by external factors, particularly in those with yin deficiency and little blood, or those with spleen and lung cold deficiency, are most susceptible to pathogens. However, if one observes that the pulse is slightly weak, there is no obstruction in the chest, or if kidney qi is insufficient leading to fluid accumulation as phlegm, or heart conditions manifesting as nausea and lack of appetite, or if one is middle-aged and experiencing gradual weakness of blood and qi, resulting in a cough that cannot be cured, it is advised to use the Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction with adjustments. This is highly effective. </p>
<p>If there is also a deficiency in yang qi, accompanied by a weak pulse and spirit fatigue, excessive sweating, one must certainly add ginseng without doubt. If the issue is merely due to spleen and stomach deficiency, unable to generate metal, leading to failure in expelling the pathogen, Liu Jun Zi Decoction should be used to tonify the spleen and lungs.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>If there is a deficiency of the spleen that cannot control water, leading to phlegm, it is advisable to use formulas such as Lizhong Decoction or Liyin Decoction, or Eight Flavor Pills to nourish the Earth Mother; these are all good methods. </p>
<p>For cough due to external pathogens accompanied by heat, there will definitely be signs of internal heat, preference for coolness, and a slippery pulse. In this case, one should use formulas like Erchen Decoction or Liu&#39;an Decoction, with appropriate cooling herbs added. If the heat is mild, add one or two qian of Huangqin; if the heat is severe, further add Zhimud, Gheda. If the heat is in the Yangming and there are symptoms of headache and thirst, adding gypsum is the right choice.</p>
<p>In cases of external attacks, in spring there is often an excessive rising and floating energy, so treatment should also focus on descending, using herbs such as Zexie, Qianhu, Haishi, and others of that nature. In summer, there is often a hot and fiery energy, so treatment should incorporate cooling herbs, such as Qinchun, Lian, Zhi, and Baike, among others.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>In autumn, there is much damp and humid atmosphere, so treatment should also include drying agents, such as Atractylodes macrocephala, white Atractylodes, dried ginger, and the like. In winter, there is much wind and cold, so treatment should also include dispersing agents, such as Fangfeng, Perilla, Cinnamon twig, and Ma Huang. The classics say that the seasonal energies harmonize with the heavens; this refers to such matters. However, it is essential to be aware of the seasonal influences, and even more so to observe the pathogenic influences. If the season is not aligned with a certain illness, and there are clear signs of incompatibility, one must prioritize the evidence over the season. Furthermore, when there are symptoms in various organs that occur together, treatment should be adjusted accordingly, thus one must not simply adhere to rigid criteria.</p>
<p>Coughing that arises during autumn and winter is due to cold constraining heat; thus, relieving the cold will naturally dispel the heat. The appropriate remedies include Liu An decoction, Er Chen decoction, and Jin Shui Liu Jun decoction—these should be administered according to the patient&#39;s condition and constitution. If the heat is particularly intense, it may be beneficial to add ingredients like Huang Qin and Zhi Mu.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment of Internal Injury Cough</h3>
<p>All coughs resulting from internal injuries must originate from the Yin portion. What is the Yin portion? It is the essence and energy of the five organs. Although all five organs possess essence and energy, the kidney is the source of primordial essence, and the lung is the master of primordial energy. Therefore, when the energy of the five organs is harmed, the disease will manifest itself from above downward, starting from the lung and spleen, ultimately reaching the kidney; when the essence of the five organs is harmed, the disease will rise from below upward, starting from the kidney and spleen, ultimately reaching the lung. If both the lung and kidney are afflicted, the other organs will not be spared. Hence, cough resulting from overexertion is the most difficult to treat, precisely because its root cause is deep-seated and not easily influenced.</p>
<p>When the disease is rooted, can it not be treated by simply addressing the symptoms? Therefore, to treat what is above, one must not focus on the symptoms above but on those below; to treat what is below, one must not focus on the symptoms below but on those above. Understand that within Qi lies essence; the lung, belonging to the metal element, is a light and empty organ. When metal is subjected to the fire&#39;s burning, it results in cough; likewise, when metal is cold and water is icy, it also leads to cough; thus, coughs must be treated in the lung. However, coughs stemming from internal injury are not solely present in the lung. The essence of all five organs is stored in the kidney, and the lesser Yin kidney channel extends from the kidney, penetrating through the liver diaphragm and entering the lung, tracing up the throat and surrounding the base of the tongue. Hence, the weakness of lung metal is often due to the depletion of kidney water, with the child (lung) weakening the mother (kidney).</p>
<p>Therefore, in treating cough due to overexertion, it is essential to prioritize strengthening water and nourishing Yin, so that the lung&#39;s energy can be replenished, allowing the cough to gradually improve.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>One should appropriately use formulas like Yiyin Decoction, Zuo Gui Pill, and Liu Wei Di Huang Pill. If there is a deficiency in the original yang, leading to a lack of vitality causing the spleen to be constrained below and the lungs to be burdened above, resulting in symptoms like wheezing, fullness, phlegm, nausea, and diarrhea with aversion to cold, then if the pulse is fine and weak, and signs of deficiency and cold are present, and the cough persists, it is not necessary to treat the cough directly; instead, one should tonify the yang, and the cough will cease on its own. Medicines such as You Gui Decoction, You Gui Pill, Ba Wei Di Huang Pill, Da Bu Yuan Decoction, Liu Wei Hui Yang Decoction, Li Zhong Decoction, and Jie Lao Powder should be used promptly based on necessity, and should not be delayed to prevent deeper complications.</p>
<p>For cough caused by internal injury, if there is a deficiency of water below and fire excess above, leading to fire damaging the lung metal and resulting in a dry cough, heat and pain in the throat, mouth sores with tidal fever, constipation with a preference for cold, and a rapid, slippery pulse, it is essential to also clear the heat to preserve the water; thus, Si Yin Decoction or a modified Yiyin Decoction, or Ren Shen Gu Ben Pill should be employed. This should be considered alongside cases of coughing blood, with detailed treatment methods referenced in the section on blood conditions.</p>
<p>For a hoarse cough, since the lung is associated with metal, when metal is strong it does not resonate, and when it is damaged it also does not resonate. A strong metal signifies that there is evil in the lung, either cold evil or fire evil. A damaged metal suggests that the true yin is compromised, which may be due to either qi deficiency or essence deficiency. For cold evil, warming and spicy remedies should be used; for fire evil, sweet and clarifying remedies should be indicated.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>Those with Qi deficiency should tonify Yang, while those with Jing deficiency should tonify Yin. Generally, if the condition is due to an external evil and is acute, treatment is easier. If it stems from deficiency, the onset is gradual, and treatment is more difficult. </p>
<p>For treating deficiency, methods should be combined with those for post-cough conditions. Cough from internal injury due to deficiency should not use drying medicines or aromatic stimulating agents like Liu&#39;an or Erchen, which should be used sparingly. Instead, one should use sweet and moistening substances to nourish Yin, such as cream, honey, lily, rehmannia, donkey-hide gelatin, ophiopogon, and peeled walnuts.</p>
<p>External evil conditions are often mistakenly thought to be caused by overexertion, leading to genuine exhaustion. This is particularly true for those whose Qi is weak and soft, where physicians might misinterpret symptoms of fever as heat and coughing as exhaustion, not distinguishing between exterior and interior issues, thus improperly using Yin-nourishing and fire-reducing medicinals. </p>
<p>It is unknown that if cold evil is already present externally, cooling medicines should not be recklessly prescribed. If there is both external cold and internal cold, it will result in a combined evil, which will cause the condition to persist and worsen. </p>
<p>Common sayings indicate that a cold or wind attack that doesn’t resolve can turn into exhaustion. However, how can a cold truly transform into exhaustion? It is merely due to the mismanagement of inept doctors that leads to daily deterioration. A frail person cannot withstand continual purging; if it remains unresolved for a long time, it can potentially become exhaustion. This indeed is a grave error of medicine.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>Therefore, when diagnosing this condition, one must closely examine both superficial and internal factors, as well as the distinctions between new pathogens and chronic illnesses, along with pulse, complexion, and bodily signs. If the true nature is determined, a few doses of Six An Decoction, Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction, or similar formulations can cure it. The inaccuracy of a physician is one of the reasons for failure.</p>
<p>In the case of a dry cough, Danxi states: the fire is severely constrained. This indicates phlegm and fire stagnation in the lungs. One should use bitter herbs to open it up and utilize tonifying methods to lower the fire. If this does not relieve the condition, it may progress to consumptive illness, necessitating the use of the reversing method. This symptom commonly affects those who feel unfulfilled. However, I believe Danxi&#39;s interpretation is quite different. If it is said that one feels unfulfilled, then their worries and thoughts may lead to internal injury, which is not merely phlegm and fire illness, nor should it be treated with bitter herbs or the reversing method.</p>
<p>A dry cough arises from insufficient fluids in the lungs, indicating internal deficiency. When the lung and kidney are not in harmony, qi cannot produce fluids, and essence cannot transform into qi, resulting in this dryness. It is essential to distinguish whether there is excess fire or not. If there is no fire in the organs, it is simply due to lung deficiency, thus one must first tonify qi to generate essence, suitable for prescriptions like Five Blessings Decoction. If the organ&#39;s qi is slightly cold, it cannot be moistened without pungent herbs, so supplementing yang will generate yin; therefore, yin-regulating decoctions or Liu Jun Zi Decoction are appropriate.</p>
<p>If there are internal heat and fire, it is essential to preserve the true yin; thus, one must first strengthen water to control fire, recommending Yi Yin Decoction or a modified version, potentially combined with a pill containing Fritillaria. If one only focuses on resolving phlegm and relieving stagnation in this condition, they will see the qi deplete further and water become more deficient, ending up like a fish stranded in a dry rut.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>Discussion on the Governance of Hejian: An Edict on Proper Treatment of Phlegm<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>The foolish observer Hejian believes that in treating cough, one should first address phlegm, hence using Nanning and Banxia as the main remedies, thinking he has found a method to treat cough. His reasoning implies that cough must originate from phlegm; thus, overcoming phlegm will naturally resolve the cough. However, this logic is flawed. </p>
<p>Coughs caused by external pathogens must arise from wind and cold; when wind and cold are present in the lungs, lung qi becomes obstructed, leading to cough, which in turn stirs up phlegm. Therefore, the root of cough from wind is based on external factors, not the other way around. Similarly, coughs caused by internal injury are always due to yin deficiency; with yin deficiency, fluids become depleted, and organs become exhausted, which leads to cough, while spleen deficiency and kidney weakness result in phlegm formation. Hence, the source of cough from yin deficiency originates in internal injuries, not from phlegm itself.</p>
<p>Thus, to say that cough should first be treated by addressing phlegm is surely not seeking the root cause! When treating cough from external factors, the most effective remedies are those belonging to the Erchen category. Why is that? It is because remedies like Nanning, Banxia, ginger, aged tangerine peel, and bitter orange are all spicy in flavor. Spiciness can penetrate the lungs and disperse cold; when cold is dispelled, phlegm cough resolves itself—this is truly a treatment that addresses the root cause, not merely treating phlegm. However, for coughs due to internal injuries involving yin deficiency, spicy and drying remedies are strictly contraindicated. Can such remedies be casually employed?</p>
<p>The classic states: the lungs require spiciness, which should be used to purge them. This applies to those with excess lung conditions needing spice. It also states: spiciness promotes qi; if there is a qi illness, one should not consume too much spice. This warns those with deficient lung conditions against spiciness. Thus, the principles regarding flavors and medicinal properties are expertly elaborated in the Inner Canon. Why does Hejian fail to comprehend this and claim that Nanning, Banxia, and similar remedies can solely treat phlegm? Can it truly be that addressing the surface symptoms of phlegm can resolve the fundamental issues of cough?<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br><strong>Secret Code of the Stone Chamber - Treatment Method for Cough</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of lung cough stem from lung deficiency, which must be treated by nourishing the lungs. However, it is also necessary to treat the kidneys. This is because the essence of the lung, as metal, returns to the kidneys at night, analogous to the bond between mother and child; although the mother may wander outside, she must return to her child&#39;s home at night for rest. If the lung metal is injured by heart fire, it must seek help from its child to defend against this fire attack. If the child is impoverished, how can they repay their mother’s efforts?</p>
<p>There is a prescription for this: use one tael each of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, four qian of shan zhu yu, five qian of yuanshen, one qian each of perilla, asparagine, licorice, and achyranthes, three qian of adenophora, and five fen of purple aster, decocted in water and taken as a remedy. The effectiveness of this prescription lies in the strong nourishment of kidney water while minimally clearing lung metal; thus, the child thrives while the mother can repay her efforts.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>There are also remedies to dispel evils; when used appropriately, they do not deplete the lung’s vitality at all. For example, when a child gathers friends, all of whom offer heartfelt support, any verbal attacks do not burden the resources of the mother. Thus, though the child&#39;s adversary may still exist, external hostility retreats at the mere mention of it, and they dare not repeatedly invade the mother’s home. This is also a subtle method of treating both the lungs and kidneys together. </p>
<p>In cases of dry cough, if the lungs have already been harmed, further complications like coughing up blood and pus will surely lead to death! Yet the desire to live can cloud judgment! It is not recognized that dry conditions causing a cough originate from external factors, not internal injuries. Even the expectoration of pus and blood arises from lung damage through coughing. To save the cough while nourishing the lung&#39;s essence, when the cough ceases, the pus and blood will also dissipate. </p>
<p>The prescription to nourish the lungs and relieve dryness consists of: three liang each of Ophiopogon, honeysuckle, and Scrophularia, and three qian each of licorice, asparagus, and Platycodon, boiled in water for consumption.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>This formula enters the lungs to moisten the fluids, alleviating floating heat and stopping pus and blood. With the internal Qi nourished and external pathogens cleared, how can one fear the difficulty of treating critical conditions? </p>
<p>For cough treatment, one should use light and clear medicines, taking them in small doses, which will show immediate effects, such as Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. However, many do not understand the principles of light and heavy, which I will further refine for lasting use. The formula includes Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Ban Xia, and Gan Cao, each a qian, and Chen Pi five fen; this is the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. I add five fen of Ren Shen and two qian of Fu Ling for even greater efficacy. When the Qi is sufficient, the pathogens easily disperse and sweating becomes easier. </p>
<p>People see the use of Ren Shen and feel uneasy—not only do doctors shy away from it, but patients also hesitate to take it. This cycle of fear leads to a situation where countless individuals remain beyond help. How can we spread the word to doctors everywhere to examine the sources of illness and use this knowledge wisely?<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>When a person has been suffering from a persistent cough for a long time, it is universally believed to be caused by an accumulation of pathogens. Why do everyday dispersing medicines fail to produce results? The reason is that the vital energy is dispersed. Once the vital energy is scattered, continuing to use dispersing medicines understandably leads to no effect even after months. The correct approach is to use one or two doses of astringent medicine to see success. </p>
<p>The prescription includes: one qian each of ginseng, white mustard seed, northern schisandra, and perilla seeds; three qian of white peony root; two qian of sour jujube seed; five qian of ophiopogon root; and five fen of fructus amomi. Prepare and take it as a decoction. One dose is light, two doses lead to complete recovery. Then, take the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pills, adding three liang of ophiopogon root and one liang of northern schisandra to the mix. If taken, the condition will not recur; otherwise, it cannot be prevented. </p>
<p>Long-term use of dispersing medicines depletes the essence of the true yin. Even if astringent medicines are temporarily effective, once the true yin is diminished, the pores are not tight. When exposed to wind pathogens, one becomes easily susceptible – this is an inevitable consequence. Taking the Rehmannia Pills nourishes the lung metal and maintains moisture, making one less susceptible to severe wind pathogens.</p>

<p>For conditions like reversed qi from weakness, cold damaging the body, pain and cramps in the muscles and bones, coughing with reversed qi, abdominal fullness, tightness in the throat and neck, inverted qi from hemorrhoids, urgent blood in hemorrhoids, nasal bleeding and bone pain, difficulty with bowel and bladder movements, dryness in the nose, anxiety, fullness, and manic tendencies, a total of twenty-two conditions can be treated through moxibustion at the bone above the external ankle, three inches inward.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: for cough with phlegm, it is advised to moxibustion at Tianqu and Feishu points to dispel heat and relieve lung qi. </p>
<p>For lung phlegm and cough that prevents lying down, one may sleep on one side. If lying on the left side, moxibustion should be on the right foot at the San Yin Jiao point; if lying on the right side, it should be on the left foot at the same point for effective treatment.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a><br>The &quot;De Xiao Fang&quot; states: For coughing and shortness of breath, locate about a finger&#39;s width below the breast, directly in the depression between the bones. The woman can bend the nipple down to measure; the point where the nipple aligns is the acupoint. Burn moxa the size of a small bean three times. For men, do this on the left side; for women, on the right. When the fire reaches the skin, it will heal. Another claim is that the acupoint should target the artery between the bones beneath the breast.</p>
<p>The &quot;Zi Sheng Fang&quot; states: For prolonged asthma and cough that prevents sleeping at night, if summer clothing also feels warm against the back, it indicates a condition at the diaphragm; moxibustion on it can cure. It also states: For chronic cough, it is advisable to moxibustion the diaphragm first, followed by the lung shu point. In cases of severe cough due to cold, moxibustion at the Tian Tu point will lead to healing.</p>
<p>The &quot;Yi Xue Gang Mu&quot; states: For coughing, take three segments from the spine, apply draining for three breaths, and for the upper back, take three segments, apply nourishing for three breaths. If it doesn’t improve, locate the lung shu point one inch and one-tenth away, and drain for six breaths along the skin outward by one and a half inches. Cold phlegm and red phlegm are both treated with virtual nourishment and actual drainage.</p>
<p>Another method: Locate Feng Men one segment away, along the skin outward by one and a half inches.</p>

<p><strong>Guidance:</strong><br>Movement: There are three types of this condition: either due to wind-cold causing coughing, or due to heart fire erratically moving and inflaming the lung passages. The method of returning to the origin and concentrating the spirit should be used to seal and secure; fire should not rise, the lung passages should not itch, and the coughing will naturally cease. For cold cough, especially practice a slight closing method. For fire cough, just stop and seal, seeking tranquility; then draw water from the kidneys to irrigate the lung fire, circulating it, and the lungs will receive moisture, causing the cough to naturally stop. Open the chest to clear the lung meridian, washing down through the lung meridian to the large intestine&#39;s nine curves, guiding it toward the valley path. </p>
<p>For cough caused by wind-cold and dampness, the external method involves making a fist and applying it at the shoulder’s edge, rubbing it down to the back and the kidney locations; self-warmth can dispel it. </p>
<p>Cough due to food accumulation requires an external method of rubbing the navel region, allowing food to gradually descend. It is necessary to be relaxed and have the diaphragm flat, allowing Qi to go down, which will lead to recovery. </p>
<p>For cough arising from deficient heat movements, one must swallow saliva, draw it down to the lower dantian, speak less, and avoid anger; this will lead to recovery. </p>
<p>Cough caused by shouting after drinking is difficult to treat and may lead to consumptive illness.<a id="trans-255p" href="#orig-255p" class="marker">[255p]</a><br>The &quot;Secret Instructions of the Stone Chamber&quot; states: The lungs, representing the metal element, are delicate organs that cannot contain foreign substances; however, they can still contain air. If a person has a persistent cough that does not improve despite taking various lung-nourishing medicines, unless air enters through the throat, the lungs will remain difficult to heal quickly. The method involves using the breath of a thirteen-year-old girl, who exhales her breath into the patient&#39;s mouth. Every day at the fifth watch (around 3-5 AM), the girl should mouth-feed the patient, fully sending her lower abdominal energy into the patient’s mouth. The patient should swallow a mouthful each day, limited to just one, which should be as effective as taking medicine. However, during the exhalation, one must strictly avoid any feelings of desire; any such motion will be not only useless but also harmful. The patient may only have one or two mouthfuls, in consideration of the girl’s health.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states: The method for guiding a cough involves sitting down with feet extended. Use the double child-rearing method, applying force to lift up, lower the head, and gradually bend down, using both hands to pull the toes three times. With strength, follow the original method to lift up, and then swallow saliva downwards into the lower abdomen. This bending method should be done twenty-four times, maintaining tranquility and benefiting from the practice.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Studies</strong> </p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A man in his twenties had been suffering from a cough for several years, his voice caught but unable to come out. The physician asked: &quot;Have you ever taken medicine?&quot; The man replied: &quot;My family is poor, I have never taken medicine.&quot; The physician said: &quot;In youth, those who do not recklessly take medicine are easier to treat.&quot; First, he administered a bitter decoction to induce vomiting; next, he used methods akin to transportation and dredged the rivers to promote significant bowel movement, and afterwards, he used a heavy formula, and the patient was indeed cured.</p>
<p>One farmer had a cough, and after an induced discharge and a purge, he was already over half better. He then took a ginseng lung tonic before bed and additionally consumed betel nut pills to stimulate his appetite.</p>
<p>Gao Sanlang from the East Gate had been coughing for a year and a half, with ringing in his ears and coughing up pus and blood for three months. His face was covered in dark spots, his body was hot, and he could not produce sound in his throat. The physician said: &quot;The source of the cough lies in the excess heart fire. It is damaged by dampness in autumn, leading to cough in winter. When winter&#39;s water is abundant, it combines with dampness, obstructing the heart, causing the fire not to descend but to rise, scorching the lung’s metal; after prolonged suffering, it results in a cough, and the metal cannot produce sound. Treating with tonics for the lungs and kidneys is not appropriate. I recommend preparing watermelon, ice, and snow materials, using methods to induce discharge, and also taking medicines to eliminate dampness; the illness will improve day by day.&quot;<a id="trans-257p" href="#orig-257p" class="marker">[257p]</a><br>Yang Shou&#39;s wife had been suffering from a cough for more than ten years, with persistent coughing for a day without relief. To stop it, musk soup was administered, yet even at midnight, the coughing persisted. After another dose, she felt somewhat nauseous the following morning, so ginseng soup was given, and after two days, she felt slightly better. After administering medicine on three occasions, the physician advised Luan Jingxian that a long-standing cough has already restrained the illness, and naturally, recovery would be slow. After several days of adjustment, the cough finally ceased. It is often said that after the cough eases, there are those who recover suddenly, and those who recover gradually. There are also cases of internal discomfort where the illness is not yet fully resolved, and cases of returning heat that must be treated without delay. Generally, after three days, a sense of relief is to be expected.</p>
<p>Zhao Junyu&#39;s wife had been ill with a cough for ten months. The physician used dried orange peel, angelica, licorice, white atractylodes, bitter orange, and platycodon root. Junyu suspected these were not suitable cough medications. The physician laughed and asked if he was surprised by the absence of black plum or poppy capsules. He explained that a winter cough is caused by the dampness of the autumn, where damp earth reverses and causes coughing. This formula scatters qi, eliminates dampness, relieves urgency, and harmonizes the meridians. After three doses, efficacy was indeed observed.<a id="trans-258p" href="#orig-258p" class="marker">[258p]</a><br>In Yan City, Dong Degou suffered from a chronic cough due to labor. A physician advised him that upon recovery, he should refrain from sexual activities. After he recovered, he became complacent and violated the prohibition, leading to his death. After his death, his wife gave birth to a son, which coincided with the day of his recovery. Initially, Dong was quite firm about keeping it a secret; only then did it become known.</p>
<p>A man, aged forty, suffered from a chronic cough, with phlegm that was thick and foul-smelling, unbearable to the nostrils. In autumn and winter, his condition was somewhat relieved, but worsened in spring and summer, characterized by alternating chills and fever, with symptoms manifesting in the afternoons, resembling those of malaria. He sweated excessively while sleeping, like water. He frequently took ephedra root and dried mulberry leaves, yet continued to sweat profusely. He also took calming and lung-soothing powders to no avail. Initially, the physician used a specific powder to induce vomiting, which brought forth phlegm resembling chicken fat, leading him to be unconscious for three days, occasionally given cool water to drink, gradually regaining consciousness and appetite. Afterward, he prescribed a mixture of ginseng and pinellia pills along with a sweet osmanthus remedy, and after a few doses, he was cured.</p>
<p>In Zhang Ban Village, a child named Lu Zichun, around seven or eight years old, suffered from a cough in the summer, becoming very weak. The physician wanted to induce vomiting, but Zichun feared for the child&#39;s frail condition and was hesitant. One day, after drinking wine, the family offered him more, and he vomited extensively, after which the cough ceased. It was likely that the bitterness of the wine acted as an effective remedy, and Zichun then fully understood the physician&#39;s advice.<a id="trans-259p" href="#orig-259p" class="marker">[259p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: </p>
<p>There was a man over fifty years old who suffered from coughing, aversion to wind and cold, dry mouth, slight heart pain, floating tight pulses in both hands, fullness and distension in the chest and sides, and a rapid pulse, with the left hand significantly larger than the right, indicating general excess in defense and deficiency internally. Upon questioning, he revealed that he usually enjoyed a diet rich in wine and meat, and had a history of food accumulation. Due to exertion in a sweat room and subsequent exposure to cold water, as well as braving light rain and enduring hunger before returning to overeat with wine and meat, he became ill. Initially, he was given four qian of ginseng and one and a half qian of ephedra root, along with two to three doses, which alleviated the cough and eliminated the aversion to wind and cold. Later, the prescription was changed to include magnolia bark, bitter orange, dried tangerine peel, green tangerine peel, (wild) vine seeds, and pinellia prepared into pills, with which over twenty doses were administered, taken with ginseng decoction, and the fullness and distension resolved.</p>
<p>Another man, aged fifty, had developed malaria after laboring in cold water during the hot months, followed by phlegm cough. By the end of summer the following year, his pulse was string-like and the left hand was weak. When struck, he would sweat slightly and produce phlegm, with constant fever and thick yellow phlegm. He was given one tael of pinellia, seven qian of white atractylodes, six qian of poria, half a tael each of scutellaria, dried tangerine peel, balloon flower root, bitter orange peel, and gypsum, along with two and a half qian of fried silkworm and one and a half qian of schisandra, prepared into pills with a paste of fermented flour, and taken with ginger decoction, thirty pills at a time. He was initially given a decoction of three herbs with added scutellaria and white atractylodes, and at night ten small stomach pills to stir his phlegm. Additionally, moxibustion was administered at five points: Dazhui, Fengmen, and Feishu, resulting in his recovery.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a><br>The &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; states: In the &quot;Lei Bian,&quot; it is recorded that during the time of Huizong, Li Fangyu served as an inner court physician. At that time, a favored concubine fell ill with phlegm cough, unable to sleep all night, her face swollen like a plate. Huizong called for Li to present a diagnosis, decreeing that if there was no improvement within three days, he would face execution. Li, anxious and at a loss, bid farewell to his wife in tears. Suddenly, he heard an outside vendor selling cough medicine, promising that for a small coin per dose, one would be able to sleep immediately. Li purchased a dose and examined it; its color was light green, and fearing the drug might be harsh, he decided to try two doses himself. Having found no adverse effects, he combined three doses into one and administered it to the concubine. That evening, her cough stopped, and by morning, her face had returned to normal. An inner servant rushed to report this, and the emperor was greatly pleased, bestowing a reward of gold and silk worth ten thousand strings. Fearing that the formula might be demanded, Li sought out the previous vendor, treated him to drinks, and offered a high price for the formula. The vendor revealed that he had learned it from a commander during his early military days, having obtained it as a spoils of war for the rest of his life. The formula consisted of genuine clam powder, fried red on new tiles, with a small amount of indigo, and mixed with diluted salt water and a few drops of sesame oil, adjusted to a dosage of two qian.<a id="trans-261p" href="#orig-261p" class="marker">[261p]</a><br>Zhao Xun&#39;s &quot;Notes on Nurturing Illness&quot; states: A young scholar from Zhao Prefecture suffered from a persistent cough, and none of the hundred medicines worked. Someone suggested using a bundle of soft mulberry branches facing south, cutting each branch into one-inch pieces to boil in a pot with five bowls of water until only one bowl remained. He was to drink this when thirsty, and after a month of this treatment, he recovered. This is also a modified method of boiling mulberry branches.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; mentions: A middle-aged woman with a dry cough had a pulse that was smooth and bean-like in shape, with the rest being scattered and large without being floating, and the left pulse was stronger than the right. Every morning at the fifth watch, she felt heat in her heart and sweat, but her anger was even worse, and there was no benefit from the herbs like platycodon. Thus, gypsum and cyperus were used as the main ingredients, along with gentian, coptis, indigo, asparagus, perilla fruit, dried tangerine peel, fried licorice, angelica, and platycodon as the assistants. In total, more than twenty prescriptions were given, and she began to feel better. A decoction of fresh ginger boiled with honey, and a decoction of dried tangerine peel were both effective for treating those without phlegm but still coughing, as the spicy-sweet ingredients moistened the lungs. If using only green tangerine peel, all the herbs should remove the white parts. </p>
<p>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: Dried tangerine peel is spicy, regulates the qi, and removes phlegm and stagnation; green tangerine peel is bitter and regulates the lower qi. Both flavors work together to disperse the qi of the three jiao (body regions). Therefore, the &quot;Sacred Beneficial Treatise&quot; states: Dried tangerine peel removes obstructive elements; without removing obstruction, phlegm will form; ephedra induces sweating; if the obstruction is not removed, sweating will stop.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a><br>A man over fifty years old was suffering from a serious cold accompanied by a cough, with a hoarse voice.

<p>&quot;The Essential Readings of Medicine&quot; states: The esteemed scholar Jin Bohan had a cough with difficulty in breathing. He had used nearly all remedies for clearing heat, moistening the lungs, transforming phlegm, and regulating the qi, but his illness showed no improvement. Upon examining his kidney pulse, it was large and soft, indicating a deficiency of qi with excessive fire. I prescribed three qian of ginseng decoction to accompany five qian of the Eight Flavors Pill, and after one dose, there was improvement. Later, I added one qian of cinnamon and eight fen of aconite to the Back to Qi Decoction. After a total of fifty doses and two pounds of the Eight Flavors Pill, he was cured.</p>
<p>The history scholar Ming Lin had been coughing for years and sought treatment from dozens of doctors, trying countless remedies, but his condition worsened. He believed he was bound to suffer from exhaustion. I said: &quot;Not so.&quot; His pulse was not rapid and weak but had a large, slippery quality on the right side, indicating unresolved wind-phlegm. He must have consumed too many sour astringents, which exacerbated his condition over time. I prescribed five doses of Ma Huang, Xing Ren, Ban Xia, Qian Hu, Jie Geng, Gan Cao, Ju Hong, and Su Zi, and after knowing the effects, he improved after ten doses.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a><br>Zhang Yuangong had a chronic cough for three years, and medication proved ineffective, so he resigned himself to his fate. One day, he visited me regarding another matter and expressed that he thought he could not be cured, but he requested a diagnosis. I asked him if he felt pain in his chest when hungry, and he said it was very painful. I noticed over ten white spots on his upper lip, which indicated that a worm was gnawing at his lungs. I prescribed a remedy made from hundred parts cream, along with black plum and betel nut. Within ten days, the pain subsided and the cough ceased. I instructed his family to search in a clean bucket, and they found more than forty small white worms. From then on, he never experienced a relapse.</p>
<p>Minister Feng Wuyue&#39;s daughter had been suffering from fever and cough for over six months. In October, she coughed up a significant amount of fresh blood. In one day, she could only consume a bowl of porridge, her large meat was consumed, her stools were watery, and she was bedridden, with a pulse rate of seven. I said: &quot;The method is not to save; this is well-known to everyone. If you can only heed my guidance and not be distracted by others, there is hope to save one out of ten.&quot; I prescribed three doses daily, each containing five qian of ginseng, three qian of astragalus, two qian of peony, and one qian of dried tangerine peel. After taking seventy doses and three pounds of a strengthening pill, she was able to get up and within three months was able to eat and drink as before. If one were to stick to conventional methods and abandon this, it would lead to hidden and lingering suffering.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a><br>&quot;The Medical Case Studies of Xue Ji&quot; states: A woman, unable to bear children, suffered from coughing, chest obstruction, and a lack of taste in her food. This indicated damage to both the spleen and lungs, with phlegm accumulating internally. The initial treatment was Gui Pi Decoction, supplemented with fresh gardenia fruit, Angelica, Fritillaria, and Platycodon, leading to gradual improvement of her symptoms.</p>
<p>A man experienced fatigue and coughed during winter. He took a dispersing remedy, thinking it beneficial. I said: This is due to weak lung qi and loose pores, making him susceptible to external pathogens. Immediate reinforcement of the spleen is essential for fundamental healing. He didn&#39;t believe me, took Six Gentlemen Decoction, removed ginseng and atractylodes, but added herbs like perilla and trifoliate orange, resulting in further depletion of his original qi, leading to lung abscess and his demise.</p>
<p>Doctor Li Beichuan, when overworked, would cough. I treated him with the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction, and he recovered. One day he relapsed and self-medicated with Ginseng and Perilla drink, worsening his condition; he then took Ginseng Dispersing Evils Powder, resulting in stiff neck, locked jaw, and tense back. I stated: He mistakenly lost sweat and body fluids, causing a transformation into a convulsion illness. Continuing with the previous decoction, I added a coin of aconite, and he recovered after four doses. If a cold leads to excessive sweating, difficulty in breathing, and continuous phlegm production, it may definitely result in abscess formation.</p>
<p>Master Tan Xizeng coughed and expectorated phlegm, with cold hands and feet. I diagnosed him with spleen and lung deficiency with cold, treated with Baizhong Yiqi, adding roasted ginger, and he was cured.&quot;<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a><br>Mr. Ruan, who was sent as an envoy, showed signs of coughing with a pale face and a runny nose; this indicated weakness in the spleen and lungs combined with an external pathogen. I treated him with a formula to tonify the middle and benefit the qi, adding Poria, Pinellia, and Schisandra, which led to recovery. I also later used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, along with Chuanxiong and Angelica, to ensure stability.</p>
<p>Director Chen Guohua had pre-existing yin deficiency and was suffering from a cough. He believed he understood medicine and used diaphoretic and phlegm-transforming medicines, which proved ineffective and worsened his condition. I stated that this was due to weakness in the spleen and lungs, but he did not believe me. Instead, he took Niu Huang Qing Xin Pill, resulting in further abdominal bloating, diminished appetite, and all signs of the three yin deficiencies became apparent. In the morning, he used Six Gentlemen Decoction, Platycodon, Cimicifuga, and the Five Flavors, to tonify the spleen and generate lung qi. In the evening, he took Eight Flavor Pill to reinforce the fire of the Mingmen, supporting the spleen. Over time, the various symptoms improved. The classic states: if one cannot treat the emptiness, how can one ask about the rest? The weakness of the spleen does not allow it to generate lung qi, and using previous medicines only exacerbates the fire; I could not understand that.</p>
<p>Zhongshu Bao Xifu, who also suffered from yin deficiency and a cough, took Qing Qi Hua Tan Pill, along with Er Chen, Scutellaria, and Coptis types, and his phlegm increased. He then used Si Wu, Coptis, Anemarrhena, and Scrophularia; he experienced abdominal bloating and hoarseness, with a floating and wiry pulse on the right and a vigorous pulse on the left. I suggested that since the spleen cannot generate lung qi and the yin fire is counteracting it, it should nourish the source of digestion. In the morning, he took a combination to tonify the middle, adding Cornus, Ophiopogon, and the Five Flavors, and in the evening, he took Six Flavor Rehmannia with Schisandra. After more than three months, he was delighted to find his condition had improved significantly.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a><br>Regarding the patient Shi Zhan, every spring he would cough. I prescribed a decoction of Ginseng and Suye, adding Scutellaria, Lian, Sang, and Xing, and he recovered. In the spring of the Year of Yisi, his condition worsened; he developed a hoarse voice and a weak pulse on the left wrist. I concluded this was related to the kidney meridian&#39;s yin fire, affecting the lung&#39;s metal; thus, I aimed to nourish the source of transformation. I prescribed Liuwei Dihuang Wan, supplemented with Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, and fried Gardenia, along with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Zhang Keming experienced coughing, treated with Er Chen, Scutellaria, Lian, Zhiqiao; he felt fullness in the chest, wheezing, and coughed up phlegm early in the morning. I added Suzi and Xingren, which led to the discharge of phlegm and a sensation of dryness and thirst. I diagnosed his early morning phlegm as due to spleen weakness leading to an inability to digest; the chest fullness was also due to spleen weakness failing to nourish the lung&#39;s metal; the excessive saliva was from spleen weakness failing to contain it; the thirst and dryness resulted from the spleen&#39;s inability to generate fluids. I then used Liu Jun Zi Tang with fried ginger and dried fruit to warmly nourish the spleen and stomach, and also incorporated Ba Wei Wan to replenish the earth element, resulting in his recovery.</p>
<p>One man experienced phlegm and coughing in summer, which did not respond to medicines for stomach fire. I diagnosed this as the fire invading the lung&#39;s metal and treated him with Mai Men Dong Tang, leading to recovery. Later, after overexertion, he coughed again; I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding Jie Geng, Shan Zhi, Pian Qin, Mai Men, and Wu Wei to assist in his recovery. However, he exhibited dryness of the mouth and fatigue, with dark and scanty urination. I employed Sheng Mai San daily to help him recover. If the cough was due to stomach fire with phlegm, I recommended Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang. For stomach qi deficiency, I suggested Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Beimu and Jie Geng. If yin fire was surging upwards, I would use Sheng Mai San with Di Huang Wan to protect the lung qi and nourish kidney water. This is a true organ issue, not simply a matter of nourishing the source of transformation, and cannot be resolved by simple methods.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a cough, side pain, and fever, which worsened in the afternoons. She was treated with a modified Xiao Yao San plus熟地 and recovered. After a year, due to anger and labor, her previous symptoms returned, accompanied by sun headaches and alternating cold and heat, as well as coughing and frequent urination. These were attributed to liver fire and blood deficiency. Using the previous formula along with Di Huang Wan for over a month, she recovered.</p>
<p>A cousin&#39;s wife experienced a cough with fever, vomiting phlegm, producing about five or six bowls of sputum day and night, with wheezing and constant coughing, chest constriction, thirst, and loss of appetite, culminating in a severe menstrual flow. This indicated a deficiency of the kidney&#39;s fire and coldness of the spleen, so she was treated with Ba Wei Wan and Fu Zi Li Zhong Tang with modifications, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman had a cough, with excessive phlegm in the morning and severe wheezing at night preventing sleep. I noted that the morning phlegm was due to a deficiency in the spleen that led to phlegm formation from food, while the nightly wheezing was due to pulmonary deficiency and excess yin fire. Hence, I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>Chen Dao Fu&#39;s eldest son suffered from deficiency in the kidney essence and had a chronic cough that worsened in the afternoons. I suggested that he should tonify the spleen, nourish the source of digestion, enabling the metal (lung) and water (kidney) to mutually support each other. During early spring, he was skeptical and instead took Huang Lian and Zhi Mu. By summer, he was coughing up phlegm, felt thirsty, urinated frequently, and had a flushed face. I prescribed a formula of Bai Zhu, Dang Gui, Fu Ling, Chen Pi, Mai Dong, Wu Wei, Dan Pi, and Ze Xie in four doses, which I then combined with Ren Shen, Huang Qi, 熟地, and Shan Yao into pills for him to take. All symptoms quickly subsided. Upon further consultation, I sensed his belief had strengthened, so I continued the previous medication as usual. However, he remained unwilling to take it, ultimately leading to his decline.<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a><br>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states: A woman suffered from prolonged coughing due to lung heat, her body felt as if it were burned, and her muscles were thin, approaching exhaustion.

<p>The &quot;Meaning of Herbs&quot; states: A patient presented with cough due to a cold, without any fever, felt extremely anxious as if near death, struggling to breathe. Upon examination, I found his head and face red, restless and unable to calm, and his pulse was large and empty. I remarked that this case was quite unusual, resembling a cold with excess heat; why would a cold also present symptoms this way? It was essential to use ginseng, aconite, and other warming herbs to support the lower source and recover the vital energy. Otherwise, he would profusely sweat at the shi and chou hours and could die from loss of yang. He did not heed my words. As night fell, without needing to exert himself, he grew even more frantic, which led him to urgently take the previous medicine. After taking it, he felt somewhat calmer for a while. I then suggested having someone sleep beside him to help bring out his sweat like rain. After using one more dose, his sweating stopped, and his body felt stable; he no longer coughed. When I inquired about what had happened, he mentioned having taken four doses of ephedra, which made him restless and feel like dying. Thus, I realized that even a cold could present an excess heat pattern, just like in cases of true cold. This was mainly due to his underlying deficiency, which made the true yang more prone to overflowing.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a><br>Lu Lingyi&#39;s respected elder was usually on a vegetarian diet, and his stomach and intestines had withered.

This autumn, however, the dry metal has been excessive, causing coughs and illnesses for everyone. Yet, the elder&#39;s body, already weak with deficiency and dryness, was particularly harmed. He experienced tightness and swelling in his chest and ribs, shortness of breath, restless sleep, and severe pain when coughing, with phlegm that was bloody and foul. Eating was difficult, speaking was hard, alternating chills and fever, and during the hours of Shen and You (the latter part of the night and early morning), the dryness intensified, causing all his ailments to worsen. His pulse was sometimes strong, sometimes weak, occasionally firm, sometimes tense and wiry. Taking medicine to clear the lungs was like pouring water onto a fire, yielding no relief. The disciples were at a loss, knowing the situation was critical.<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a><br>I was also informed that my lung abscess was becoming serious, and due to my old age, I could not bear it.

First, I opened the obstruction of the lung&#39;s qi, and then I felt some relief in my breathing, was able to eat a little, and could expel phlegm more easily. My body could also tilt slightly, indicating a significant chance of recovery. But I said: Not yet. I see that the situation is coming on too urgently, and if I am forced to seek immediate relief, ultimately, a temporary opening can easily lead to a reclosure. When it closes again, the previous method cannot be used again. Now, while it is temporarily open, I will explore multiple methods to remedy it, ensuring recovery by the winter solstice in sixty days. The dryness within the body and the dryness of the season are intertwined and difficult to resolve. We must wait for the dry metal to withdraw its qi, allowing the lung metal to attain tranquility. I urge diligent treatment for the condition during this period of sixty days, as there will be frequent crises and recoveries. Generally, all methods used should be active adjustments because supplementing is not appropriate for lung diseases.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　《素问》生气通天论篇曰：秋伤于湿，上逆而咳，发为痿厥。阴阳应象大论曰：秋伤于湿，冬生咳嗽。秋湿既胜，冬水复旺，水湿相得，肺气又衰，故乘肺而为咳嗽。其发为痿厥者，盖湿气内攻于脏腑则咳逆，外散于筋脉则痿弱也。当秋之时，湿气大行，秋伤于湿，湿则于肺，肺以秋适旺，湿虽入之不能发，至冬肺衰，然后湿始动也。雨淫腹疾，则当发为下利，冬以阳气内固，湿气不能下行，故上逆而为咳嗽。秋者，清肃之气，收敛下行之体也。为湿所伤，是长夏之气不与秋令也。秋令不及，所胜妄行，故火得以炎上而克金。心火既刑于肺，故肺气逆而为咳。所不胜者侮之，木气上行，与火同德，动而不息者也。所生者受病，故肾水亏也。长夏已亢，三焦之气盛也。命门者，三焦之合也。故迫肾水上行与脾土湿热相合为痰，因咳而动于脾之湿，是以咳嗽有声有涎。不发于秋而发于冬者，以其六阴之极，肃杀始得其气故也。但秋伤湿，上逆为咳嗽，为痿厥。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>其因病之原，则与春之风、夏之暑、冬之寒，三者同。其令行于时，则与三者异。夫三者，皆是本时之令也。湿乃长夏之令，何于秋言之？盖春夏冬每一时各有三月，故其令亦各就其本时而行也。若长夏则寄旺于六月之一月耳。秋虽亦有三月，然长夏之湿令，每侵过于秋而行，故曰秋伤于湿。若夫秋伤湿，其令行于时之义，上文已论之矣。前篇所谓上逆而咳，发为痿厥，不言过时，似是当时即发者。但既与风暑寒三者并言，则此岂得独为即发者乎。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>然经无明文，终亦不敢比同后篇，便断然以为冬发病也。虽然，湿本长夏之令，侵过于秋耳，纵使即发，亦近于过时而发者矣。此当只以秋发病者为论。湿从下受，故干肺为咳，谓之上逆。夫肺为诸气之主，今既有病，则气不外运，又湿滞经络，故四肢痿弱无力而或厥冷也。后篇所谓冬生咳嗽，既言过时，则与前篇之义颇不同矣。夫湿气久客不散，至冬而寒气大行，肺恶寒而或受伤，故湿气得以乘虚上侵于肺，发为咳嗽也。观者以此意求之，经旨其或着乎？<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>　　　　　用药法</p>

<p>　　咳谓无痰而有声，肺气伤而不清也。嗽谓无声而有痰，脾湿动而为痰也。咳嗽是有痰而有声，盖因伤于肺气而咳，动于脾湿因咳而为嗽也。经言五脏六腑皆有咳嗽，咳嗽属肺，何为脏腑皆有之？盖咳嗽为病，有自外而入者，有自内而发者。风寒暑湿，外也；七情饥饱，内也。风寒暑湿先自皮毛而入，皮毛者肺之合，故虽外邪，欲传脏腑，亦必先从其合而为嗽，此自外而入者也。<a id="orig-92p" href="#trans-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>七情饥饱，内有所伤，则邪气上逆，肺为气出入之道，故五脏之邪，上蒸于肺而为嗽，此自内而发者也。然风寒暑湿有不为嗽者，盖所感者重，径伤脏腑，不留于皮毛。七情亦有不为嗽者，盖病尚浅，止在本脏，未即上攻。所以伤寒以有嗽为轻，而七情饥饱之嗽，久而后见。治法当审脉证三因，若外因邪气，止当发散，又须原其虚实冷热。若内因七情，则随其部经，在与气口脉相应，当以顺气为先，下痰次之。有停饮而咳，又须消化之方，不可用乌梅、罂粟酸濇之药。其寒邪未除，亦不可便用补药。<a id="orig-93p" href="#trans-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>尤忌忧思过度，房室劳伤，遂成瘵疾，宜养脾生肺也。　　《仁斋直指》云：感风者鼻塞声重，伤冷者凄清怯寒，挟热为焦烦，受湿为缠滞，瘀血则膈间腥闷，停水则心下怔忪，或实或虚，痰之黄白，唾之稀稠，从可知也。治嗽大法：肺脉浮，为风邪所客，以发散取之；肺脉实，为气壅内热，以清利行之；脉濡散为肺虚，以补肺安之。其间久嗽之人，曾经解利，以致肺胃俱寒，饮食不进，则用温中助胃，加和平治嗽之药。<a id="orig-94p" href="#trans-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>至若酒色过度，虚劳少血，津液内耗，心火自炎，遂使燥热乘肺，咯唾脓血，上气涎潮，其嗽连续而不已。唯夫血不荣肌，故邪在皮毛，皆能入肺，而自背得之尤速，此则人参、芎、归所不可无。一种传注，病涉邪恶，五脏反克，毒害尤深，近世率用天灵盖、蛤蚧、桃柳枝、丹砂、雄黄、安息香、苏合香丸通神之剂。然则咳嗽证治，于此可以问津索途矣，抑犹有说焉。肺，出气也；肾，纳气也。肺为气之主，肾为气之本。凡咳嗽暴重，动引百骸，自觉气从脐下逆奔而上者，此肾虚不能收气归元也。当以破故纸安肾丸主之，毋徒从事于宁肺。<a id="orig-95p" href="#trans-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>　　　　医贯 【明　赵献可】</p>

<p>　　咳谓无痰而有声，嗽是有痰而有声，虽分六腑五脏之殊，而其要皆主于肺。盖肺为清虚之腑，一物不容，毫毛必咳。又肺为娇脏，畏热畏寒，火刑金固嗽，水冷金寒亦嗽，故咳嗽者，必责之肺。而治之之法，不在于肺而在于脾，不专在脾而反归重于肾。盖脾者肺之母，肾者金之子，故虚则补其母，实则泻其子也。　　如外感风寒而咳嗽者，今人率以麻黄、枳壳、紫苏之类，发散表邪，谓从表而入者，自表而出。如果系形气病气俱实者，一汗而愈。若形气病气稍虚者，宜以补脾为主，而佐以解表之药。何以故？盖肺主皮毛，惟其虚也，故腠理不密，风邪易以入之。若肺不虚，邪何从而入耶？古人所以制参苏饮中必有参，桂枝汤中有芍药、甘草，解表中兼实脾也。脾实则肺金有养，皮毛有卫，已入之邪易以出，后来之邪无自而入矣。<a id="orig-96p" href="#trans-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>若专以解表，则肺气益虚，腠理益疏，外邪乘间而来者，何时而已耶？须以人参、黄芪、甘草以补脾，兼桂枝以驱邪，此予谓不治肺而治脾，虚则补其母之义也。　　《仁斋直指》云：肺，出气也；肾，纳气也。肺为气之主，肾为气之本。凡咳嗽暴重，动引百骸，自觉气从脐下逆奔而上者，此肾虚不能收气归元，当以地黄丸、安肾丸主之，毋徒从事于肺，此虚则补子之义也。余又有说焉。五行之间，惟肺肾二脏，母盛而子宫受邪。<a id="orig-97p" href="#trans-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>何则？肺主气，肺有热，则气得热而上蒸，不能下生于肾，而肾受邪矣。肾既受邪，则肺益病。此又何也？盖母藏子宫，子隐母胎，凡人肺金之气，夜卧则归藏于肾水之中，今因肺受心火之邪，欲下避水中，而肾水干枯，有火无可容之地，于是复上而病矣。　　有火烁肺金而咳嗽者，宜清金降火。今之医书中，论清金降火者，以黄芩、天麦冬、桑白皮清肺金，以黄连降心火，石膏降胃火，以四物、黄蘗、知母降阴火；谓枳、半渗泄伤阴，易用贝母、(艹舌)蒌、竹沥、枇杷叶，以润肺而化痰。以上治法，岂不平正通达耶？殊不知清金降火之理，似是而实非。<a id="orig-98p" href="#trans-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>补北方，正所以泻南方也；滋其阴，即所以降火也。独不观启元子壮水之主以制阳光乎？予相火论及滋阴降火论中，已详言黄蘗、知母之不宜用，与夫寒凉诸药之害矣。予又有说焉。王节斋云：凡酒色过度，损伤肺肾真阴者，不可服参、芪，服之过多则死，盖恐阳旺而阴消也。自此说行而世之治阴虚咳嗽者，视参、芪如砒毒，以黄蘗、知母为灵丹，使患此证而服此药者，百无一生，良可悲也。有能寡欲而不服药者，反可绵延得活。可见非病不可治，乃治病之不如法也。盖病本起于房劳太过，亏损真阴，阴虚而火上，火上而刑金故咳，咳则金不能不伤矣。予先以壮水之主之药，如六味地黄之类，补其真阴，使水升而火降，随即以参、芪救肺之品，以补肾之母，使金水相生而病易愈矣。世之用寒凉者，肤浅庸工，固不必齿，间有知用参、芪者，不知先壮水以镇火，而遽投参、芪以补阳，反使阳火愈旺，而金益受伤，岂药之罪哉？此所谓不识先后著者也。<a id="orig-99p" href="#trans-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>有脾胃先虚，土虚不能制水，水泛为痰，子来乘母而嗽者矣。又有初虽起于心火刑金，因误服寒凉，以致脾土受伤，肺益虚而嗽者，乃火位之下，水气承之，子来救母，肾水复火之雠，寒水挟木势而上，侵于肺胃，水冷金寒故嗽。前疾未除，新病愈甚。粗工不达此义，尚谓痰火难除，寒凉倍进，岂不殆哉！斯时也，须用六君子汤加炮姜以补脾肺，八味丸以补土母，而引水归源，此等治咳嗽之法，幸同志者加之意焉！　　《金匮》云：咳而上气，喉中水鸡声，射干麻黄汤主之。<a id="orig-100p" href="#trans-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>此论外感有嗽而声哑者。盖金实不鸣，金破亦不鸣，实则清之，破则补之，皆治肺之法也。又须知少阴之络入肺中，循喉咙挟舌本，肺为之标，本虚则标弱，故声乱咽嘶舌萎，声不能前，出仲景伤寒书。一男子年五十余岁，病伤寒咳嗽，喉中声如齁，与独参汤一服而齁声除，至二三服而咳嗽亦渐退，服二三斤，病始全愈。　　有一等干咳嗽者，丹溪云：干咳嗽，极难治。此系火郁之证，乃痰郁其火邪在中，用逍遥散以开之，下用补阴之剂而愈。<a id="orig-101p" href="#trans-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>　　　　医门法律 【清　喻昌】</p>

<p>　　　　　论证</p>
<p>　　咳嗽一证，窃见诸家立论太繁，皆不得其要，多致后人临证，莫知所从，所以治难得效。以余观之，则咳嗽之要，止惟二证。何为二证？一曰外感，一曰内伤，而尽之矣。夫外感之咳，必由皮毛而入，盖皮毛为肺之合，而凡外邪袭之则必先入于肺，久而不愈则必自肺而传于五脏也。内伤之嗽，必起于阴分，盖肺属燥金，为水之母，阴损于下则阳孤于上，水涸金枯，肺苦于燥，肺燥则痒，痒则咳不能已也。总之咳证虽多，无非肺病，而肺之为病，亦无非此二者而已。但于二者之中，当辨阴阳，当分虚实耳。盖外感之咳，阳邪也，阳邪自外而入，故治宜辛温，邪得温而自散也。内伤之咳，阴病也，阴气受伤于内，故治宜甘平养阴，阴气复而咳自愈也。然外感之邪多有余，若实中有虚，则宜兼补以散之。<a id="orig-117p" href="#trans-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>内伤之病多不足，若虚中挟实，亦当兼清以润之。大都咳嗽之因，无出于此，于此求之，自得其本，则治之无不应手，又何有巢氏之十咳证，陈氏之三因证，徒致乱人心目而不得有济也。留心者，其熟味此意。　　经云：肺之令人欬。又曰：五脏六腑，皆令人咳，非独肺也。又曰：皮毛先受邪气，邪气以从其合也。又曰：五脏各以其时受病，非其时各传以与之。然则五脏之咳，由肺所传，则肺为主脏而五脏其兼者也。故五脏六腑，各有其证，正以辨其兼证耳。既有兼证，则亦当有兼治。虽有兼治，无非以肺为主也，是固然矣。然愚则犹有说焉。则谓外感之咳，与内伤之咳，其所本不同，而所治亦异。盖外感之咳，其来在肺，故必由肺以及他脏，此肺为本而他脏为标也。内伤之咳，先因伤他脏，故必由他脏以及肺，此他脏为本而肺为标也。<a id="orig-118p" href="#trans-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>凡治内伤者，使不知治他脏而单治肺，则真阴何由以复？阴不复则咳终不愈。治外感者，使不知治阳而妄治阴，则邪气何由以解？邪不解则嗽终不宁。经曰：治病必求其本。何今人之不能察也！　　劳风证，《内经》评热病论曰：劳风法在肺下，其为病使人强上冥视，唾出若涕，恶风而振寒，此为劳风之病。巨阳引精者三日，中年者五日，不精者七日。咳出青黄涕，其状如脓，大如弹丸，从口中若鼻中出，不出则伤肺，伤肺则死矣。按劳风证，即劳力伤风证也。盖人之劳者，必毛窍开而汗液泄，所以风邪易入。凡今人之患伤风者，多有此证。故轻者惟三四日，重者五七日，必咳出浊痰如涕而愈者，此即劳风之属也。但以外感之法治之，自无不愈。<a id="orig-119p" href="#trans-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>其有劳之甚者，或内摇其精，或外劳其形，劳伤既甚，精血必亏，故邪不能散而痰不能出，此即劳损干嗽之类也，所以多不可治。　　外感有嗽，内伤亦有嗽，此一实一虚，治当有辨也。盖外感之嗽，必因偶受风寒，故或为寒热，或为气急，或为鼻塞声重，头痛吐痰。邪轻者脉亦和缓，邪甚者脉或弦洪微数。但其素无积劳虚损等证，而陡病咳嗽者，即外感证也。　　若内伤之嗽，则其病来有渐，或因酒色，或因劳伤，必先有微嗽而日渐以甚。<a id="orig-120p" href="#trans-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>其证则或为夜热潮热，或为形容瘦减，或两颧常赤，或气短喉干，其脉轻者亦必微数，重者必细数弦紧。盖外感之嗽其来暴，内伤之嗽其来徐。外感之嗽因于寒邪，内伤之嗽因于阴虚。外感之嗽，可温可散，其治易；内伤之嗽，宜补宜和，其治难。此固其辨也。然或脉证素弱而忽病外感者有之，或形体素强而病致内伤者亦有之。此中疑似，但于病因脉色中，细加权察，自有声应可证。若或认之不真，而互谬其治，则吉凶攸系不浅也，最宜慎之！<br>　　　　　外感证治</p>

<p>　　凡内伤之嗽，必皆本于阴分。何为阴分？五脏之精气是也。然五脏皆有精气，而又惟肾为元精之本，肺为元气之主。故五脏之气分受伤，则病必自上而下，由肺由脾，以极于肾；五脏之精分受伤，则病必自下而上，由肾由脾，以极于肺；肺肾俱病，则他脏不免矣。所以劳损之嗽，最为难治，正以其病在根本，而不易为力也。病在根本，尚堪治不求本乎？故欲治上者，不在乎上而在乎下；欲治下者，不在乎下而在乎上。知气中有精，肺属金，为清虚之脏，凡金被火刑则为嗽，金寒水冷亦为嗽，此咳嗽所当治肺也。然内伤之嗽，则不独在肺。盖五脏之精皆藏于肾，而少阴肾脉，从肾上贯肝膈，入肺中，循喉咙，挟舌本。所以肺金之虚，多由肾水之涸，正以子令母虚也。故凡治劳损咳嗽，必当以壮水滋阴为主，庶肺气得充，嗽可渐愈。<a id="orig-125p" href="#trans-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>宜一阴煎、左归丸、六味地黄丸之类，择而用之。其有元阳下亏，生气不布，以致脾困于中，肺困于上，而为喘促、为痞满、为痰涎呕恶、为泄泻畏寒。凡脉见细弱，证见虚寒，而咳嗽不已者，此等证候，皆不必治嗽，但补其阳而嗽自止。如右归饮、右归丸、八味地黄丸、大补元煎、六味回阳饮、理中汤、劫劳散之类，皆当随宜速用，不得因循以致侵深无及也。　　内伤咳嗽，凡水亏于下，火炎于上，以致火烁肺金而为干咳，烦热喉痛，口疮潮热，便结喜冷，尺寸滑数等证，则不得不兼清火以存其水，宜四阴煎，或加减一阴煎、人参固本丸主之。此当与咳血证参酌，其治详见血证门。　　咳嗽声哑者，以肺本属金，盖金实则不鸣，金破亦不鸣。金实者，以肺中有邪，非寒邪即火邪也。金破者，以真阴受损，非气虚即精虚也。寒邪者，宜辛宜温；火邪者，宜甘宜清。<a id="orig-126p" href="#trans-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>气虚者宜补阳，精虚者宜补阴。大都此证邪实者其来暴，其治亦易；虚损者其来徐，其治亦难。治损之法，当与后干咳证参酌用之。　　内伤虚损之嗽，多不宜用燥药及辛香动气等剂，如六安、二陈之类皆不可轻用，惟甘润养阴，如乳酥、蜂蜜、百合、地黄、阿胶、麦冬、去皮核桃肉之类，皆所宜也。外邪证多误认为劳损，而遂成真劳者，此必其人气体柔弱，而医家望之已有成心，故见其发热遂认为火，见其咳嗽遂认为劳，不明表里，率用滋阴降火等剂。不知寒邪既已在表，凉药不宜妄投。若外既有寒，而内又得寒，则表里合邪，必致邪留不解，延绵日甚。俗云：伤风不愈变成劳。夫伤风岂能变劳？特以庸医误治，而日加侵削，则柔弱之人，能堪几多清理，久而不愈，不至成劳不已也，此实医之所误耳。<a id="orig-127p" href="#trans-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>故医于此证，最当详察在表在里及新邪久病等因，脉色形气等辨，辨得其真，则但以六安煎、金水六君煎或柴陈煎之类，不数剂而可愈矣。医之不精，此其一也。　　干咳嗽证，在丹溪云：火郁之甚。乃痰郁火，邪在肺中，用苦梗以开之，下用补阴降火，不已则成劳，须用倒仓法，此证多是不得志者有之。愚谓丹溪此说殊不然。夫既云不得志，则其忧思内伤岂痰火病也，又岂苦梗、倒仓所宜攻也？盖干咳嗽者，以肺中津液不足枯涸而然，此明系内伤亏损，肺肾不交，气不生津，精不化气，所以干濇如此。但其有火无火，亦当辨治。若脏平无火者，止因肺虚，故必先补气自能生精，宜五福饮之类主之。若脏气微寒者，非辛不润，故补阳则阴生，宜理阴煎或六君子汤之类。若兼内热有火者，须保真阴，故必先壮水，自能制火，宜一阴煎，或加减一阴煎，兼贝母丸之类。若以此证而但知消痰开郁，将见气愈耗，水愈亏，未免为涸辙之鲋矣。<a id="orig-128p" href="#trans-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>　　　　　论河间治口　敕先治痰说<a id="orig-129p" href="#trans-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p>
<p>　　愚观河间谓治嗽当先治痰，因以南星、半夏之属为主，似得治嗽之法矣。此其意谓嗽必因痰，故胜其痰而嗽自愈，则理有不然也。盖外感之嗽，必因风寒，风寒在肺则肺气不清，所以动嗽，动嗽然后动痰。此风邪痰嗽之本，本于外感，非外感本于痰也。又如内伤之嗽，必因阴虚，阴虚则水涸金枯，所以动嗽，脾虚肾败，所以化痰。此阴虚痰嗽之本，本于内伤，非内伤本于痰也。今曰治嗽当先治痰，岂求本之道乎？然治外感之嗽，惟二陈之属为最效。何也？盖南星、半夏、生姜、陈皮、枳壳之类，其味皆辛，辛能入肺，辛能散寒，寒邪散则痰嗽自愈，此正所以治本而实非以治痰也。若内伤阴虚之嗽则大忌辛燥，此辈岂堪轻用哉！经曰：肺欲辛，以辛泻之。此肺实者之宜辛也。又曰：辛走气，气病无多食辛。此肺虚者之忌辛也。气味宜否之理，《内经》妙用如此。河间何以不察，而谓南星、半夏之属，但能治痰。岂果治痰之标，便能治嗽之本乎？<a id="orig-130p" href="#trans-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>

<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic of Internal Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Cough</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes the lungs to induce coughing? Qi Bo replied: All five viscera and six bowels can cause coughing; it is not solely the lungs. The Emperor said: I wish to understand its characteristics. Qi Bo replied: The skin and hair are connected to the lungs. The skin and hair first encounter pathogenic influences, which can enter through this connection. When cold food and drink enter the stomach and ascend to the lungs through the lung meridian, it results in lung cold. When the lungs are cold, both external and internal pathogens can unite and cause symptoms, leading to coughing from the lungs. </p>
<p>The five viscera each suffer from disease at their respective times, and if it is not that time, they transfer influence to the lungs. </p>
<p>Human beings are interrelated with heaven and earth, so the five viscera are treated accordingly. When affected by cold at the right time, it results in disease; if mild, it may cause coughing, and if severe, it may lead to diarrhea or pain.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The qi of the five organs corresponds with the qi of the four seasons and the five phases. Therefore, if one experiences a slight illness, it first ascends to the lungs, resulting in a cough; if severe, it rises to the upper, causing a downward flow that leads to painful dysentery. </p>
<p>In autumn, the lungs are the first to be affected; in spring, the liver is first; in summer, the heart; during the extreme yin, the spleen; and in winter, the kidneys are first affected. </p>
<p>The term &quot;first affected&quot; refers to how it then transmits to the lungs, causing a cough. The cough is fundamentally a disease of the lungs; this is why the lungs are mentioned first as being affected. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What differentiates them?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The symptoms of lung cough are characterized by coughing with wheezing and sound, and in severe cases, spitting blood.&quot; </p>
<p>The lungs govern respiration; thus, a cough can produce sound from wheezing. The lungs manage qi; in severe cases, the qi may rise inversely, resulting in spitting blood. </p>
<p>For heart cough, the symptoms include coughing with heart pain, and the throat feeling blocked, resembling a lump; in severe cases, there is swelling of the throat and a sensation of obstruction. </p>
<p>The throat is associated with the lungs; the heart fire affects the metal phase, hence the throat feels blocked. The hand shao yin heart meridian originates in the heart, extends to connect with the heart system, and ascends to include the throat, thus resulting in swelling and pain in the throat.</p>
<p>For liver cough, the symptoms include pain below the ribs on both sides; in severe cases, one cannot turn, and turning leads to fullness beneath the ribs. </p>
<p>The liver meridian spreads through the rib area, which connects upward to the lungs; therefore, a cough leads to pain beneath the ribs. The inability to turn indicates an inability to bend or reach; this is because liver pathogenic influence ascends to the lungs, causing the cough, and if severe, it rebelliously obstructs below without allowing movement, leading to fullness beneath the ribs.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms of spleen-related cough manifest as pain under the right rib when coughing, with a pulling sensation towards the shoulder and back; in severe cases, movement becomes difficult, and coughing intensifies upon movement. </p>
<p>(Note: The spleen resides on the right side, hence the pain under the right rib when coughing. Spleen energy ascends to the lungs, and the lung&#39;s corresponding area is in the shoulder and back, causing the pulling sensation towards the shoulder and back. If the situation is mild, it affects the lungs leading to a cough; if severe, it impacts the primary channel.)</p>
<p>Symptoms of kidney-related cough cause pain that pulls the shoulder and back, and in severe cases produce phlegm when coughing.</p>
<p>(Note: The kidney channel passes through the diaphragm into the lungs, hence the pain when coughing relates to the lung&#39;s channel. Both lungs and kidneys may accumulate water, which leads to the production of phlegm in severe cases.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about the diseases of the six hollow organs? Where does the illness occur? Qi Bo replied: A long-standing cough in the five organs will transfer to the six hollow organs.</p>
<p>(Note: The illnesses of the six hollow organs shift based on the energy from the five organs.)</p>
<p>If the spleen&#39;s cough persists, it will affect the stomach. The symptoms of a stomach-related cough include coughing and vomiting; in severe cases, long worms may emerge.</p>
<p>(Note: The spleen and stomach are interconnected; if the spleen is ill, the disease transfers to the stomach, leading to the stomach&#39;s energy reversing and causing vomiting. If vomiting is severe, food energy is consumed, allowing worms to enter the stomach, thus leading to their emergence in severe cases.)</p>
<p>If the liver&#39;s cough continues, it will affect the gallbladder. Symptoms of a gallbladder-related cough include coughing and vomiting bile.</p>
<p>(Note: If the pathogenic factor is in the gallbladder, it causes reversal in the stomach, leading to bitter vomiting.)</p>
<p>If the lung&#39;s cough persists, it will affect the large intestine. Symptoms of a large intestine-related cough manifest as coughing and involuntary defecation.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The large intestine is a visceral organ of the lungs, serving as the channel for transmission. Thus, if it ascends, there will be coughing; if it descends, there will be incontinence. If the heart&#39;s cough persists, the small intestine will be affected. The small intestine coughs in a way that leads to a loss of qi, causing both qi and cough to be lost. If the qi of the extremities ascends, there will be coughing; if it descends, there will be incontinence. When both qi and cough are lost, it indicates that the qi is ascending and dispersing both upward and downward. If the kidney&#39;s cough persists, the bladder will be affected. The bladder coughs in a manner that leads to incontinence. The bladder is the organ of bodily fluids, responsible for the water pathway, hence the coughing leads to incontinence. If coughing continues for a long time, the three burners (San Jiao) will be affected. The three burners cough in a way that leads to abdominal fullness and a lack of desire for food and drink. The three burners are the organ of the middle passages, thus causing abdominal fullness. When coughing occurs, the upper burner cannot manage intake, resulting in a lack of desire for food and drink. All these conditions aggregate in the stomach, and relate to the lungs, causing excessive saliva and phlegm, with facial swelling and rebellious qi. When coughing occurs, the lungs elevate and fluids overflow, leading to an increase in saliva. Water and qi rising cause facial swelling and rebellious qi. The Emperor asked: How should this be treated? Qi Bo replied: To treat the organs, address their points; to treat the viscera, address their connections; and for swelling, treat the meridians. Coughing in the five organs should be treated at their points; coughing in the six viscera should be addressed at their connections; and for swelling, treat the meridians related to the lungs and stomach.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Great Discussion on the Changes of Qi</h3>
<p>In years when fire is excessive, summer heat prevails, leading to the dysfunction of the lungs associated with metal. As a result, the people suffer from fevers and experience symptoms of breathlessness and coughing. 【Note: In years governed by Wu, when fire is overly active, it overcomes metal. Therefore, the lungs are affected by heat, resulting in wheezing and coughing.】 </p>
<p>In years when metal is excessive, dry air prevails, harming the liver associated with wood. In severe cases, this leads to breathlessness and coughing with reversed qi, and in extreme cases, there is blood in the cough. 【Note: Wheezing and reversed qi are lung diseases. The liver meridian passes through the lungs, hence the severity of the cough. The liver governs blood storage, which explains the presence of blood.】 </p>
<p>In years when water is excessive, cold air prevails, harming the heart fire, leading to severe breathlessness and coughing. 【Note: In years governed by Bing, when water is overly active, it causes water qi to ascend, resulting in wheezing and coughing.】 </p>
<p>In years when wood is deficient, dryness becomes prevalent, leading again to summer heat and fire overpowering the lung metal, resulting in coughing and nasal conditions. 【Note: When the annual wood energy is insufficient, the dryness attributed to metal becomes rampant, and fire resurfaces because its mother is suppressed. In years with deficiencies, the opposing energies may run amok, leading to its own weakening. Therefore, the Qi of the lungs can gain supremacy. The lungs open to the nose, hence the coughing and nasal discharge.】<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Annotation: The Yangming is victorious; it is the year of Mao and You. The dry metal dominates above, hence the great coolness transforms the pulse, resulting in cough. Yangming&#39;s triumph arises from within, causing throat blockage and cough.</p>
<p>Annotation: The cold and austere metal energy emerges from within; the blockage and cough occur because the Yangming dry metal ascends to the lungs, creating a mutual resonance of energies. The Emperor asked: How does the recovery of the six energies manifest? Qibo replied: The recovery of the Shaoyin involves internal heat production, energy moving to the left, ascending to the right, resulting in cough and skin pain.</p>
<p>Annotation: The energy moving to the left indicates that the fire energy emanates from the water of the left kidney. Ascending to the right means that the lungs and kidneys intersect vertically, with the kidneys being the source and the lungs the endpoint. When the fire overtakes the lung&#39;s metal, coughing and skin pain arise. The recovery of the Taiyin involves transformation due to dampness, leading to internal fluid production, resulting in coughing and wheezing sounds.</p>
<p>Annotation: When the energy reaches an extreme, the transformation to cough and wheeze, accompanied by sound, indicates that fluids have invaded the lungs.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The notes explain that the qi from the heavens influences the three types of qi, contributing to ailments like coughing and vomiting due to exposure to wind and fire. The governance of the Lesser Yin is concerned with the qi transformation that occurs pre-naturally, resulting in people&#39;s ailments of cough and wheeze. The notes clarify that coughing and wheezing arise from heat diseases originating in the upper body.</p>
<p>When the qi of the terminal phase becomes dry, it leads to movement, causing residual fire to become concentrated, resulting in swelling and causing cough and wheeze. The notes explain that the terminating qi is governed by the Yangming, which oversees the dry and metallic transformation, thus causing dryness to lead to movement, heat accumulating from the interaction, and consequently leading to cough and wheeze. The governance of Yangming pertains to the post-natal qi transformation, leading to people&#39;s ailments of throat obstruction and cough. The notes mention that throat obstruction results from being affected by dry and damp qi, leading to sickness.</p>
<p>In separate discussions on Yin and Yang, it is noted that when the Yang is affected, it leads to a lack of vitality, prone to coughing and diarrhea. The notes explain that this Yang corresponds to the Lesser Yang qi. When in illness, the qi becomes insufficient while the fire becomes strong, leading to metallic burning, thus promoting coughing.</p>
<p>In relation to menstrual regulation, excess qi results in coughing and wheezing movements upward. The notes indicate that the lungs govern qi and breathing, so an excess leads to upward disturbances like coughing and wheezing.</p>
<p>As for syncope discussions, the hand Taiyin experiences reversal, resulting in a feeling of fullness and coughing. The notes clarify that the lungs govern qi, which can cause a feeling of emptiness and fullness due to reverse flow resulting in coughing. Furthermore, Yangming reverse flow leads to wheezing and coughing.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes</strong>: When Yangming qi is obstructed, it leads to wheezing; when it is counterflowing, it leads to coughing.<br><strong>On the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Coughing and wheezing occur when obstruction is in the chest, involving the hand Yangming and Taiyin. <strong>Note</strong>: When pathogens harm the skin, hair, and qi layer, it leads to coughing and upward-reversal of qi. The pathway of the hand Taiyin begins in the middle burner, circulating up to the diaphragm, while the pathway of the hand Yangming enters the chest cavity and connects to the lungs below the diaphragm, belonging to the large intestine. When the pathogen overwhelms the meridian, the stomach experiences counterflow.<br><strong>On the Communication of Vital Energy to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>In autumn, when attacked by dampness, there is upward-reversal and coughing, leading to weakness and counterflow. <strong>Note</strong>: In cases of Yin disease, the energy descends to extremes and then ascends, hence in autumn, being injured by dampness causes upward-reversal and coughing.<br><strong>On Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In Lesser Yin, what is termed vomiting, coughing, and wheezing occurs because yin qi is below and yang qi is above. When all yang qi is floating without support, it results in vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. <strong>Note</strong>: The cold water of Lesser Yin is below, while the fire qi of the monarch is above. When water and fire do not interact, all yang qi rises without support, causing the upward-reversal of yang heat, resulting in the disease of vomiting, coughing, and wheezing. In Lesser Yang, when coughing is accompanied by blood, it indicates damage to the yang vessels. When yang qi has not yet fully flourished above but the pulse is full, fullness leads to coughing, causing blood to appear in the nose. <strong>Note</strong>: When yang qi is not yet flourishing above, it indicates that by the ninth month, Lesser Yang begins to flourish. Blood flows with qi, and when qi is not yet flourishing but the pulse is already full, the blood accumulates and reverses.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Transmission of Disease Related to Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>Lung diseases characterized by wheezing and coughing lead to fullness and pain in the sides after three days; a feeling of heaviness and body pain after one day; bloating after five days; and if it does not resolve after ten days, death occurs. In winter, symptoms appear with the onset of cold, and in summer, they manifest as heat. </p>
<p><em>Note: The onset of symptoms corresponds to the energy of the sun—rising in the morning brings forth vitality, while setting in the evening draws it back. The lungs govern this vital energy, thus reflecting this cycle of inhalation and exhalation.</em></p>
<p>Heart disease initially presents as heart pain, followed by coughing after one day; pain in the sides after three days; obstruction and accumulation after five days, with body pain and heaviness, and if it persists for three days, death follows. In winter, this occurs during midnight; in summer, during noon. </p>
<p><em>Note: The heart is associated with fire. Midnight in winter indicates dominance of water, extinguishing the fire. Noon in summer indicates excessive fire, leading to self-immolation.</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Regulation of the Five Elements</strong></p>
<p>When metal is insufficient, it is said to give rise to transformation. When the conditions for transformation occur, symptoms include coughing and wheezing, affecting the lungs, presenting as sneezing, coughing, nasal discharge, and bleeding. </p>
<p><em>Note: Coughing and wheezing are manifestations of the lungs being harmed by fire. Sneezing, coughing, nasal discharge, and bleeding are diseases of metal.</em></p>
<p>When metal is excessive, it is described as solidification and formation. During conditions of solidification and formation, coughing becomes a prevalent symptom. </p>
<p><em>Note: Coughing in this context signifies damage to the lungs by fire.</em></p>
<p>When the lesser yang governs the heavens, fire energy descends, while lung energy rises, resulting in coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal obstruction. </p>
<p><em>Note: The upward movement is due to the descending atmospheric energy, feared to be overpowering, thus causing a follow-through response. Coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and obstruction all indicate lung disease.</em><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>The autumn&#39;s Geng and Xin energies are disrupted by external evils, resulting in &quot;Lung Wind.&quot; The symptoms of Lung Wind include excessive sweating and aversion to wind, presenting a pale and ashen complexion. There may be shortness of breath and cough that is intermittent, worse in the evening than during the day. The area above the eyebrows is examined, showing a pale color.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Wind is a Yang evil that opens the pores, which leads to excessive sweating. Wind harms Yang, causing a mismatch between the evil and the proper energies, hence the aversion to wind. The lung is associated with metal and has a white color. The lung governs Qi and can lead to coughing due to movement; when pressured by wind evil, this leads to shortness of breath. During the day, Yang energy is stronger and can overcome the evil, resulting in less severity; in the evening, the energy weakens, thus the illness worsens. The area above the eyebrows is a point for examining lung conditions.</p>
<h3>Essential Diagnostics Conclusion</h3>
<p>Spring acupuncture during the Autumn Equinox leads to muscle spasms and reverse Qi, which manifests as coughing.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The organs are fundamentally superior to the lungs, governing the regulation and nourishment of Yin and Yang. The nourishing and protecting Qi and blood help to moisten the muscles and bones and benefit the joints. If the liver is diseased and in turn injures the lung, this causes the muscles to spasm and the Qi to move in reverse, hence leading to an upward reversal of Qi that results in coughing.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the True Organs of Jade Mechanism</h3>
<p>When the autumn pulse is insufficient, it leads to wheezing, shallow breathing, and coughing, with blood seen in the upper airways and pathological sounds noted.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lungs govern the Qi of the entire body; when Qi is insufficient, it causes breathlessness and wheezing, with shallow breathing leading to cough. If Qi is insufficient and reverses upwards, then blood also moves upwards. If Qi is insufficient and reverses downwards, one hears the pathological sounds of groaning.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p>The lung is associated with coughing.<br>(Note: The theory of yin and yang suggests that the lung undergoes a transformation into cough.)</p>
<p><strong>On the Discussion of Heat Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>For illnesses of the kidney and wind, if the condition is weak, one should not apply acupuncture. If acupuncture is applied despite the weakness, after five days the patient&#39;s qi will surely manifest. When it manifests, there will be a sensation of heat accompanied by shortness of breath, heat rising from the chest and back to the head, sweating with hot hands, dry mouth and bitter thirst, yellowish urine, swelling below the eyes, rumbling in the abdomen, heavy body and difficulty in movement, missed menstruation, irritability, inability to eat, and trouble lying flat. Lying flat induces coughing, which is known as wind-water. The true qi ascends in rebellion, hence the bitter mouth and dry tongue. One cannot lie flat, as it leads to coughing up clear water. Those with water-related illnesses cannot lie down, as it causes fright, and fright exacerbates coughing.<br>(Note: The term &quot;wind-water&quot; is used here because wind provokes the movement of water. True qi refers to the vital essence from the heart of the organs. The heart belongs to fire and is adverse to water&#39;s evils; thus, when water qi rises, it forces the heart&#39;s qi to rebel, resulting in a bitter mouth and dry tongue. The kidney is the root, while the lung is the final aspect; both the metal and water organs are filled with moisture. Therefore, when water qi rises in the lung, it leads to coughing out clear water. Water evils invade the stomach, preventing one from lying down. The stomach meridian connects to the heart; when yang qi enters yin, yin and yang become imbalanced, causing fright and anxiety. The heart&#39;s qi overreaches into the lung, as metal fears fire and heat, thus exacerbating the cough.)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>How can it be known that this is caused by a cold? Indeed. When one speaks irrationally, how can this be said? The lungs govern sound; entering the liver produces breathing, entering the heart leads to speech, entering the spleen results in singing, entering the kidneys causes groaning, and when inside oneself, it leads to weeping. Therefore, it is known that lung pathology entering the heart results in irrational speech.</p>
<p>The illness consists of fever with chills, possibly leading to coughing and wheezing, with a pulse that is floating and strong but thin. The accumulation in the lungs is called &quot;Xi Bi,&quot; located beneath the right rib, large like a cup. If it persists for a long time, it causes chills and fever, coughing and wheezing, generating lung stagnation, which is obtained on the days of the spring甲乙. How can this be said? Heart illness transfers to the lungs, the lungs should transfer to the liver. The liver is suited to spring; if the sovereign does not receive evil, the lungs wish to return to the heart, but the heart is unwilling to accept, thus leaving a blockage as accumulation. Therefore, it is known that &quot;Xi Bi&quot; is obtained on the days of spring甲乙.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Coughing due to Mixed Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When heat resides in the upper jiao, coughing leads to lung wasting. If the pulse at the inch is rapid, and the person coughs with turbid phlegm in the mouth, this indicates lung wasting. </p>
<p>A question arises: if the cough is severe, how can we tell if it is a lung abscess? It should involve pus and blood; if summoned up, the person will die. What is the pulse type? The master said: the pulse at the inch is fine and rapid; fine means wind, rapid means heat. A fine pulse indicates sweating, while a rapid one indicates aversion to cold. Wind is associated with the defensive qi; when the breath does not enter, heat overwhelms the nutritive qi; when inhaled, it does not come out. Wind harms the skin and hair, heat injures the blood vessels. If wind resides in the lungs, the person will cough, experience dry mouth, wheezing, swollen throat without thirst, and much turbid phlegm, along with chills at times. The heat causes blood stagnation, accumulating into pus and abscesses that can be vomited like rice porridge—if emerging early, it can be saved; if the pus has formed, it is fatal. </p>
<p>For coughing with dyspnea and a watery chicken-like sound in the throat, use the Decoction of Rhubarb and Ephedra. For cough and dyspnea with continual turbid spitting, but unable to sleep while sitting, use the Soap Tree Pill. For coughing with a floating pulse, use the Decoction of Thick Pericarp and Ephedra.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A patient suffers from water retention, with swelling in the face, limbs, and body. Urination is not smooth; when the pulse is examined, water is not mentioned, but chest pain is reported, with qi rising to the throat, resembling the condition of roasted meat. The patient tends to have a slight cough and wheezing. As the teacher said, what type of pulse is this? The teacher responded: The pulse at the inch position is deep and tight. Deep indicates water, tight indicates cold; deep and tight clash, resulting in a blockage at the lower abdomen. Initially, the condition is slight but can go unnoticed in the young and vigorous. After the decline of yang, the defensive and nutritive energies become disturbed, with yang diminished and yin dominant. A slight cold blockage occurs, and kidney qi rises, causing a constriction in the throat and urgent pain below the ribs. The physician thinks that retaining fluid and treating with drastic purging will alleviate the condition, but as the qi doesn&#39;t disperse, the illness persists. Afterward, inducing severe vomiting causes stomach emptiness and distress, dryness in the throat craving water, poor urination, and undigested food leading to swelling in the face, hands, and feet. They also administered Ting Li Wan to remove water; at that time, the patient seemed to improve slightly, but overindulgence in food and drink caused the swelling to return as before, accompanied by painful pressure in the chest and ribs that felt like a runaway dolphin. If water rises and spills over, it leads to cough, wheezing, and reverse qi. The first step is to attack the defensive qi to stop the condition, then treat the cough; once the cough resolves, the wheezing will naturally improve. It is essential to treat the new illness first; the other illness will follow. </p>
<p>In the case of coughing up blood, reversed qi, and difficulty breathing, the pulse is rapid with signs of heat, leading to an inability to lie down, which results in death. For those who cough due to excessive drinking, this must lead to coughing up blood, a result of extreme overindulgence.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on the Deficiency and Excess of the Organs Regarding Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is ill, it first manifests as heart pain and incessant coughing. If the diaphragm is obstructed, the body feels heavy and this persists for three days, leading to death. The small intestine is the receptacle organ; when one coughs, the qi expels simultaneously. The pulse in the lungs comes weakly; if it does not reach adequately, it causes wheezing and coughing, with blood appearing in sputum and the presence of disease sounds below. If there is deficiency, cold arises, leading to cough, difficulty in breathing, exhaustion, and excessive sadness. Furthermore, if lung illness persists with coughing leading to blood, bodies feel hot and breathing is short, the pulse should be thin. If the pulse is instead floating and large, and the color appears red instead of white, it indicates fire overpowering metal, which is ten times more fatal and untreatable. In lung illnesses with wheezing and coughing, if the body is cold without heat, and the pulse is slow and weak, treatment is possible. If there is deficiency, one cannot breathe properly; the ears feel heavy, throat is dry, and there is wheezing and coughing with difficulty breathing, along with shoulder and back pain. If there is coughing with involuntary urination, it is due to the upper deficiency failing to control the lower. When drinking alcohol in a draft, if it affects the lungs, it leads to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. If there is blood, it is untreatable; if no blood is present, treatment is possible.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Prescriptions of a Thousand Gold</strong><br><em>by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Cough</strong>  </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;All five organs and six bowels can cause coughing.&quot; The lungs are externally situated, close to the upper parts, and associated with the skin and hair, which easily receive pathogens; thus, the lungs are particularly prone to cough. When pathogens invade the lungs, symptoms include chills, heat, wheezing, sweating, coughing affecting the shoulders and back, and wheezing noises; in severe cases, it leads to coughing up blood. </p>
<p>If lung cough persists, it transmits to the large intestine; the cough&#39;s manifestation will then involve incontinence of feces. Kidney cough manifests as pain in the lower back, and in severe instances, involves coughing up phlegm. If kidney cough persists, it transmits to the bladder; the manifestation will then involve incontinence of urine. </p>
<p>Liver cough presents as pain in the left side of the ribs, and in severe cases, the patient cannot turn over. If liver cough persists, it transmits to the gallbladder; the cough will lead to the discharge of bitter clear fluid. </p>
<p>Heart cough manifests as heart pain, a sensation of obstruction in the throat, and in severe cases, can lead to throat paralysis or swelling. If heart cough persists, it transmits to the small intestine; the manifestation will then involve loss of breath. </p>
<p>Spleen cough manifests as pain in the right side of the ribs, accompanied by a pulling sensation in the shoulders and back, and in severe cases, the patient cannot move; movement leads to severe coughing. If it continues for a long time, it transmits to the stomach; the manifestation will then involve coughing and vomiting; in severe cases, it can lead to expulsion of long worms.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A persistent cough that does not cease affects the Triple Burner. The symptoms of a cough associated with the Triple Burner include coughing with a sensation of fullness in the abdomen, inability to eat or drink. All of this accumulates in the stomach and relates to the lungs, causing excessive phlegm and facial swelling along with upward-contrary qi. When there is cold wind, and one is exposed to it, it injures the skin, penetrating into the internal organs, resulting in the above cough and shortness of breath. Sudden exposure to inappropriate cold harms the skin; if it combines with the lungs, it leads to coughing and shortness of breath, or pain in the chest and sides. If coughing up blood-streaked phlegm occurs, it indicates that heat has been affected by untimely cold, becoming violently concentrated and unable to disperse gradually, leading to deep-seated stagnation, likely indicating lung abscess. Coughing with warm medications may worsen the cough, and when accompanied by severe heat with purulent blood, sweating and aversion to cold will be present. When there are untimely cold instances, one must observe the four seasons closely.</p>
<p>When asked about the ten kinds of cough, the teacher replied: There is windy cough, cold cough, phlegm cough, liver cough, heart cough, spleen cough, lung cough, kidney cough, gallbladder cough, and Jueyin cough.

If one coughs due to drinking cold fluids or eating cold food, it is termed cold cough. A feeling of hardness and fullness below the heart, along with cough-related pain in the sides, with a pulse that is slow, is referred to as phlegm cough.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing is associated with the pulse indicating water; it can be treated with a decoction of ten dates. If one cannot find rest due to coughing, this is because the yin is unable to resist pathogens. Those who cough and cannot lie down will have pain radiating up along the neck. Their cough resembles that of a child with whooping cough. For those who consume alcohol and cough, they will surely vomit blood; this results from prolonged sitting and excessive drinking. If the pulse is deep, one should not induce sweating. In cases of chronic cough over several years, if the pulse is weak, it can be treated; if it is excessively strong, it leads to death. A weak pulse suggests that the condition may readily worsen; it indicates that there is fluid retained in the chest, thus belonging to someone with fluid issues. Sweating emerges with difficulty breathing, implying fluid issues. A cough accompanied by frequent urination, akin to loss of control, should not be treated with sweating, as sweating could induce cold chills or fainting. </p>
<p>For illnesses characterized by vomiting blood, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, with a rapid pulse indicating heat, those unable to lie down may face death. In cases of coughing and difficulty breathing with a rapid pulse, death follows, as the person&#39;s condition has deteriorated. A large, scattered pulse indicates a state of robust qi but deficient blood, referred to as having a superficial condition without a deep one. Difficulty breathing and facial swelling with a floating, large pulse is untreatable and often worsens with dysentery. When one experiences restless breathing and wheezing, this indicates lung swelling and a potential for fluid retention; inducing sweating can lead to healing. </p>
<p>In general, when dealing with breathing issues, many have found relief through the use of emetic herbs or acupuncture, which is important to deeply understand.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing due to cold damage has two patterns: one is the Taiyang pattern with cough, treated with Xiao Qing Long and Xiao Chai Hu. The other is the Shaoyin pattern with cough, treated with Zhen Wu Decoction, Si Ni San, and Zhu Ling Decoction. Generally, if heat is in the upper jiao, the person must drink water. If water accumulates below the heart, the lung becomes floating; the lung governs cough, and the water vapor rides on it, causing a cough with slight wheezing. Zhang Zhongjing states: if the cold damage does not resolve at the surface, and there is water vapor below the heart, leading to dry retching, fever, and cough, Xiao Qing Long Decoction is the primary treatment. If urination is not smooth and there is fullness in the lower abdomen, remove Ma Huang and add Fu Ling. For alternating chills and fever, fullness and pain in the chest and sides, or cough, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is the primary treatment; remove Ren Shen and Da Zao, adding Wu Wei Zi and Gan Jiang. If it is the Shaoyin pattern with cough, heaviness and pain in the four limbs, poor urination, and diarrhea with cough, Zhen Wu Decoction is the primary treatment; add Wu Wei Zi and Gan Jiang. In general, the water vapor from cold damage arises from excessive water consumption. The ancients treated coughing from water vapor: if the problem is in Yang, then Xiao Qing Long Decoction is used; if in Yin, then Zhen Wu Decoction is used. For cold extremities, abdominal pain, or diarrhea with cough, Si Ni San is the main treatment; add Wu Wei Zi and Gan Jiang. If diarrhea persists for six to seven days, with cough, dry thirst, agitation, and inability to sleep, Zhu Ling Decoction is the prime remedy.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Coughing Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Coughing refers to the presence of sound without phlegm, indicating that the lung qi is injured and not clear. &#39;Sough&#39; refers to having phlegm without sound, resulting from dampness in the spleen that produces phlegm. Coughing entails having phlegm and producing sound, which stems from lung qi injury and the movement of spleen dampness, leading to both cough and sough. Spleen dampness occurs when one is injured by humidity in autumn, causing accumulation in the spleen. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if there’s injury from dampness in autumn, one is bound to cough in winter. Generally, the nature of autumn is meant to be clear, but if this is disturbed, the qi will counteract and result in coughing, and if severe, it can excite spleen dampness and produce phlegm. Thus, it is understood that the spleen cannot retain dampness; though the lung qi is injured, it won&#39;t produce phlegm. Phlegm has less cold and more heat. Hence, coughing is not solely a disease of the lungs, as the lungs govern the skin and are responsible for external factors, thus wind and cold can first injure them. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all the five organs and six bowels can lead to coughing; it is not the sole domain of the lungs, as they each govern their respective times and can be affected by illness. The conditions vary; cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire—each can cause coughing. Only when dampness leads to phlegm drinks entering the stomach, lingering without movement, and solely entering the lungs does it result in coughing. For instance, dampness in the heart channel is called heat phlegm, in the liver channel it is called wind phlegm, in the lung channel it is named qi phlegm, and in the kidney channel it is known as cold phlegm; treatments differ and should be addressed according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is coughing without phlegm, use pungent and sweet substances to moisten the lungs. Therefore, when treating coughs, prioritize phlegm treatment; for phlegm treatment, prioritize regulating qi. Thus, Nánxīng and Bànxià are effective against phlegm, leading to spontaneous alleviation of cough; Zhǐkē and Chénpí promote the flow of qi, allowing phlegm to descend. For those with phlegm who can eat, use the Dà Chéngqì Tāng to mildly purge; if phlegm prevents eating, use the Hòubò Tāng for treatment. In summer, if cough accompanied by fever occurs, it is termed &quot;heat phlegm cough&quot; and should be treated with Four Liang of Xiǎo Chái Hú, adding One Liang of Shígāo and Half Liang of Zhīmǔ. In winter, if cough comes with chills and fever, it is termed &quot;cold cough&quot; and should be treated with Xiǎo Qīng Lóng plus apricot kernels. These are general principles; one should adjust based on the specific symptoms and timing, considering the condition&#39;s strength or weakness—this is the fundamental approach to treatment.</p>
<p>When one Yang is affected, there may be slight coughing and diarrhea, with the three jiaos (organs) not functioning well, resulting in coughing upwards and diarrhea downwards, with unsteady heart fire, manifesting as a pull; regulate the center and disperse to treat. </p>
<p>Coughing can originate from all five organs, due to inner injuries to the spleen and stomach, or from external wind-evil. The skin and hair are related to the lungs; wind and cold follow the source and enter, opening the pores for interior and exterior to connect, first transmitting to the lungs and resulting in cough, indicating lung heat. Cold transforms into heat, leading to phlegm production, hence wheezing fullness. The classics state: the throat feels obstructed like a knot; in severe cases, it leads to coughing blood. Chest fullness, wheezing, and thick, sticky phlegm indicate lung qi heat.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Duties of Filial Piety in Confucianism</strong> (Yuan, Zhang Congzheng)</p>
<p>Coughing and wheezing are essentially the same condition. Later scholars may distinguish cough as yang and wheeze as yin, but there is no substantial evidence for this. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses coughing exclusively in one section, without mentioning wheezing. Therefore, it can be concluded that cough is simply another form of wheeze and vice versa. The &quot;Discussion on Yin and Yang&quot; states: &quot;In autumn, one suffers from dampness, leading to cough in winter.&quot; Additionally, the &quot;Five Organs Generation&quot; text mentions &quot;coughing and wheezing with difficulty in breathing.&quot; The &quot;Essential Diagnosis&quot; concludes that &quot;spring treatment addresses autumn cough, which is cyclical.&quot; It also indicates in the &quot;Calm and Composed&quot; section that persistent cough indicates a reversal of kidney energy. The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; exclusively addresses cough in its various sections, and other texts focus on cough without mentioning wheeze, thereby confirming that they refer to the same condition. Some may argue that wheeze is a separate condition, as indicated in writings on exogenous febrile diseases, which describe cough as a sound resembling stairs in the throat; this perspective is unfounded. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; treats wheeze simply as a cough. The &quot;Discourse on the Flowing Vital Energy&quot; states: &quot;In autumn, one suffers from dampness, leading to an upward reversal and cough.&quot;<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discussion on the correspondence of yin and yang is essentially the same, and the absence of the character for &quot;cough&quot; indicates that a cough is clearly a form of &quot;sore throat.&quot; The reason I emphasize this is because Confucius said: &quot;One must indeed rectify names!&quot; Since coughs have historically been attributed to the lungs as a disease, this notion is not easily changed. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: lung diseases manifest as wheezing and cough. It also says: cough and shortness of breath occur with stagnation in the chest, affecting the hand&#39;s taiyin and yangming channels. Among the twelve meridians in the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; only the taiyin lung meridian mentions: &quot;The lungs are full and swollen, leading to wheezing and coughing,&quot; while the other meridians do not address it. Although the &quot;Suwen&quot; indicates that all five viscera and six bowels can have coughs, the essence lies in the lungs being central. The &quot;Suwen&quot; also says: &quot;The skin and hair are associated with the lungs; they are the first to receive pathogenic qi.&quot; The commentary suggests that the pathology refers to cold qi. The text further states: &quot;Pathogenic qi enters through their connection; if cold food and drink enter the stomach and travel up via the spleen meridian to the lungs, the lungs become cold. Cold lungs lead to an internal-external connection with pathogens, which can then result in a lung cough.&quot;<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Later generations see these words and wrongly conclude that coughing is due to cold, without comparing them to other texts. How could they know that all six qi can cause coughing? If one were to claim that coughing is due to cold evil, then how do we explain excessive fire in some years, where intense heat leads to lung evil, causing widespread coughing? Similarly, in years where wood is insufficient, the heart qi is delayed, overpowering the lung metal, resulting in coughs and nasal congestion. During periods of transformation, metal may be deficient, leading to sneezing and coughing; in times of hardening, excessive metal causes cough as well. In lesser yang&#39;s administration, fire descends while lung metal ascends, resulting in coughs and sneezes. When fire is excessive, it can lead to coughing up blood and restlessness. During lesser yang&#39;s control, if the body&#39;s defenses are strong, one experiences a full chest and cough; if the atmospheric heat becomes trapped, it can trigger reverse cough and vomiting. When the three qi arrive, heat is present, leading to people suffering from coughing and vomiting. In the final qi, if yang fails to contain itself, one will cough. In the rebound of lesser yang, dryness and excessive heat can cause frightening coughs and blood discharge, and in severe cases, reverse coughing leading to blood loss. In lesser yin&#39;s control, heat rises above while clear qi emerges from below, with cold and heat clashing in the middle, making people suffer from coughing and wheezing. When the three qi are active and the heavenly order is set forth, great fire spreads, secondary fire takes hold internally, swelling results in coughing and wheezing, and severe cases may lead to blood stagnation. In lesser yin&#39;s control, if external pathogens prevail, sneezing can occur, and in severe cases, coughing and wheezing may ensue. In the rebound of lesser yin, internal heat rises, qi moving left and right can lead to coughing, skin pain can enter the lungs, causing cough and nasal congestion.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

The laborious wind cough produces yellowish-green phlegm, resembling pus and the size of a pellet; this too is a wind cough. If there is loss or something sought is unattainable, it leads to a sound from the lungs, indicating lung heat and dryness; this is a heat-related cough. Yangming counterflow presents with wheezing, coughing, and body heat; this is also a heat-related cough. A sudden onset of disease can cause slight breath and frequent coughing; this indicates fire-related cough. Wheezing cough results from dampness affecting the Yangming; this is damp-related cough. If wind and water cannot be righted, it leads to coughing; this is also damp-related cough. Kidney energy issues with a distended abdomen and swollen legs, along with heavy wheezing, reflect dampness-related cough. In cases of spleen obstruction, there is lethargy in the limbs and a cough that brings up fluids, leading to great cold; this is a cold-related cough.

Conversely, there are many young people, regardless of gender, who perish within months from a cough.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Coughing Caused by Autumn Dampness</strong></p>
<p>Autumn is characterized by clear and crisp air, which leads to the gathering and descending energies of the body. When harmed by dampness, this is due to the lingering heat of late summer, which does not align with the principles of autumn. When the autumn vibe is insufficient, excess actions prevail, allowing fire to ascend and dominate metal. Since heart fire afflicts the lungs, lung Qi rebels, resulting in coughing. Those who cannot withstand this are disrespected; wood energy ascends, aligning with fire’s nature, causing continuous motion. Those born under this condition suffer illness, resulting in the depletion of kidney water. With prolonged excess of late summer, the energies of the triple burner become vigorous. The Mingmen (Gate of Life) is the convergence of the triple burner. Hence, kidney water is forced upwards and mingles with the damp heat of the spleen, creating phlegm, which leads to coughing with sound and sputum. If coughing does not occur in autumn but manifests in winter, it is due to the extreme of six Yin energies, and the air becomes conducive to harm, thus resulting in coughing in winter instead of autumn. Coughing represents the reversal and ascent of Qi. When Qi rises in rebellion, the face may swell slightly; if it intensifies, the entire body may swell, transforming into water retention. Therefore, it is said that when turbid Qi is present above, it causes distention. Moreover, it is stated that all depressive Qi belongs to lung metal.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is what it refers to. Spring is harmed by the wind, summer is harmed by the heat, winter is harmed by the cold; the reasoning for these is smooth and coherent, and the term &quot;time&quot; harms the term &quot;order.&quot; Only autumn is harmed by dampness, causing the term &quot;order&quot; to wound the term &quot;time,&quot; which readers do not doubt. These four instances have no excess and harm what they accompany. The evil comes later; the main qi of the year each misassigns its share, causing illness, which is a certain principle. If it is said that the term for autumn harms the term for dampness, its wording connects with the previous three sentences, but its reasoning and principles do not connect. Generally speaking, reasoning and principles are coherent and need not be bound by wording. Therefore, those who interpret poetry do not let wording harm meaning, nor let meaning harm intent, and thus they grasp its essence. Hence, it is said: &quot;Spring is harmed by the wind,&quot; which implies human capability is harmed by the wind, but that&#39;s not the case. If so, one would only suffer headaches from strong winds; how then could it be said that summer brings diarrhea? Now, saying &quot;spring is harmed by the wind&quot; clearly indicates time harms order. The classics state: &quot;The eastern winds bring infantile wind; they harm people externally in the muscles, but internally they reside in the liver.&quot; It is also said: &quot;In spring, the damage from Jia and Yi is called liver wind.&quot; Using these two sentences for comparison with the earlier text allows the reasoning to connect logically. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the Suwen, the chapter on the transmission of life energy states: In autumn, one is harmed by dampness, which causes an upward reversal leading to cough and results in weakness and numbness. The Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondence states: Being harmed by dampness in autumn leads to coughing in winter. Once autumn dampness prevails and winter moisture increases, the dampness and moisture interact, causing lung energy to weaken, which then manifests as coughing. The resultant weakness and numbness occurs because the internal dampness attacks the organs, resulting in upward coughing, while the external dispersal affects the tendons and leads to weakness. During autumn, the dampness is pervasive; being harmed by dampness during this season is a disruption of the long summer energy and its alignment with autumn. When autumn energy is insufficient, it falters and allows fire to rise and overcome metal. Since heart fire penalizes the lungs, lung energy reverses, leading to cough. What cannot be overcome is insulted, as wood energy ascends, sharing attributes with fire, causing continuous movement. Those affected suffer illness, leading to kidney water deficiency. With the long summer having reached excess, the energy of the Triple Burner is strong. The Mengmen, or life gate, is the convergence of the Triple Burner. Hence, the forced ascent of kidney water combines with the damp heat of the spleen soil to form phlegm, which, in turn, causes coughing with sound and phlegm. Coughing that does not arise in autumn but in winter is due to the extreme of six yin, where the onset of contraction begins to take effect. Thus, being harmed by autumn dampness results in upward coughing, leading to weakness and numbness.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The root of illness is the same as that of the spring wind, summer heat, and winter cold; however, their influences vary with the seasons. Each of these three corresponds to its own season&#39;s characteristics. Dampness is the characteristic of late summer, but what of autumn? Each season—spring, summer, and winter—has its own three months, so their influences operate within their respective periods. However, late summer&#39;s influence is primarily concentrated in the month of June. Although autumn also has its three months, the dampness from late summer often extends into autumn, which is why it is said that autumn is harmed by dampness. Regarding the notion that autumn is harmed by dampness, the principles governing its seasonal influence have been discussed previously. In the earlier section, it mentioned conditions such as cough due to counterflow, leading to paralysis and numbness, without specifying a delay in timing, suggesting that these arise immediately.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, although there is no clear text, I dare not compare it with the later chapters, and thus I decisively conclude that winter is the season for the onset of disease. Nevertheless, dampness is fundamentally a consequence of late summer, which encroaches upon autumn; even if it arises, it is indeed late in coming. This should only be discussed in relation to the diseases that manifest in autumn. Dampness originates from below, thus causing the lungs to dry, which leads to coughing, referred to as upward rebellion. The lungs are the master of all qi, so if there is already an illness, the qi cannot circulate outward, and dampness stagnates in the meridians, causing the limbs to become weak and powerless, and sometimes even cold and pale. The later chapter&#39;s mention of winter cough, already stating that it arrives late, indeed differs significantly from the meaning in the earlier chapter. When dampness lingers and does not disperse, and as winter&#39;s cold qi rises prominently, the lungs detest the cold and may be harmed, thus allowing the dampness to invade the lungs and manifest as coughing. Can one glean this intent and discern its significance from the texts?<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

Internally, there are symptoms of wheezing, coughing, and reversal of qi, along with vexation, chest fullness, and heat. At night, there is excessive nasal discharge and frequent sneezing, with nasal blockage. The lung is greatly filled with metal (qi), supporting the mother (lung function). The heart, spleen, and lungs all suffer from cold evil, resulting in sweet saliva; water assaults earth, causing fear. The abdomen is greatly cold, and this condition is called &quot;cold in the middle.&quot; White phlegm forms bubbles; when lung qi is weak, it results in extreme cold, thus supporting the mother. One should expel kidney water from the lungs; it can only be resolved with pungent and warm medicine.

<p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing can be classified into categories such as wind-cold, phlegm-damp, fire-stagnation, labor cough, and lung distension. In spring, when the energy is rising, use cooling medicines, such as Erchen Decoction with herbs like Banxia or Jingjie. In summer, characterized by heavy fire, use Qinshi (Qu) or Lian (Tian) to address this. In autumn, damp heat harms the lungs, and in winter, cold from the wind attacks externally; after dispersing with medicines, use Banxia to expel phlegm to prevent recurrence. Wind-cold leads to phlegm retention; to open the pores, utilize Erchen Decoction with Ma Huang, Jie Geng, and Xing Ren to eliminate phlegm and adjust based on symptoms. Fire affects the metal element, thus transforming phlegm and reducing fire. For labor cough, it is advisable to use Si Wu Decoction with bamboo sap and ginger juice, primarily nourishing Yin. Dry coughs are challenging to treat; these are symptoms of fire stagnation where phlegm obstructs fire. Use bitter herbs to dispel it, followed by medicines that nourish Yin and clear fire, such as Si Wu with fried Gan Cao and bamboo sap; if not resolved, it can lead to labor cough, common among those who feel frustrated — the overturned warehouse method is effective. For significant lung deficiency cough, those who have kidney deficiency will often experience this. Use ginseng paste, complemented with Chen Pi and fresh ginger, generally accompanied by phlegm-expelling medicines.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>When there is lung distention and coughing, either left or right, leading to inability to sleep, this is due to phlegm combined with blood stasis, obstructing qi; one should nourish blood to promote qi flow, lower fire, and soothe the liver to clear phlegm, using the Four Substance Decoction with peach kernel, myrobalan, green peel, bamboo juice, and ginger juice. If there is coughing with pain in the flanks, one should soothe liver qi with green peel and phlegm-relieving herbs, and for fullness, use white mustard seeds and later apply the Er Chen Decoction with nux vomica, cyperus, indigo, green peel, and ginger juice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming - Dai Sigong)</p>
<p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The ancients say: all organs and bowels can experience coughing. While coughing pertains to the lungs, why is it that all organs and bowels are involved? Coughing arises from illness, which can originate from external factors or arise internally. External factors include wind, cold, heat, and dampness; internal factors include emotions and issues related to hunger and fullness. Wind, cold, heat, and dampness first enter through the skin and hair; since the skin and hair are connected to the lungs, even though these are external evils, they must first affect the skin before impacting the organs, resulting in coughing — this is the external invasion. On the other hand, if internal harm arises from emotions or issues of hunger and fullness, the pathogenic qi can rebel upwards. Since the lungs govern the entry and exit of qi, the pathogens of the five organs can ascend and cause coughing — this is an internal manifestation. However, not all instances of wind, cold, heat, and dampness result in coughing; this is due to the severity of the illness causing direct harm to the organs and not lingering in the skin. Similarly, not all emotional disturbances result in coughing; this occurs when the illness is still mild, remaining confined to the originating organ without immediately attacking upwards. Thus, in cases of cold damage with coughing, it is considered milder, while coughing due to emotional issues or hunger and fullness can reoccur over time. For all forms of coughing, regardless of whether the cause is internal or external, it is advisable to administer Erchen Decoction with half a qian each of apricot kernel, five flavors, and ginseng. If there is temporary alleviation after drinking one or two mouthfuls of water, it indicates a hot cough; if relief is found after sipping hot soup, it indicates a cold cough. For treating a hot cough, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with five flavors; for a cold cough, use Li Zhong Decoction with five flavors. These methods have been tried and proven effective, as noted in &quot;Medical Remnants.&quot;<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughs of various types can be treated with the Dream-Responding Guanyin Powder, and for those with wheezing, it is advisable to take the Yangzheng Pill before meals. For thick phlegm and a heavy cough, sometimes with blood, chew a pinch of mint and fresh sesame seeds, then take the Suzi Decoction to relieve the Qi. If a cough occurs after exposure to wind, with a dislike of wind and sweating, or the body feeling hot, or clear nasal discharge, administer Gui Zhi Decoction with half a penny of ginseng, apricot kernels, and Schisandra. For coughing with excessive sweating, when the body is weak and cannot tolerate heat medicines, give the Juhu Scent Powder. If a cough arises from cold exposure, with dislike of wind and no sweating, or body heat, or clear nasal discharge, prescribe the Apricot Decoction. </p>
<p>For coughs caused by both wind and cold, whether with dislike of wind with or without sweating, headache, body aches, nasal congestion, and thick, sticky tears, use the Xiao Qing Long Decoction. The above three remedies can be used for coughs associated with the Taiyang channel in cases of cold damage. For coughs resulting from heat, with spontaneous sweating and thirst, or a cold appearance with sweating, the Liuhe Decoction with one penny of Schisandra is appropriate. If the cough is due to dampness, with body aches and heavy sensations, or sweating or difficult urination, this is often due to heat entering water, exposure to rain and dew, or not changing out of wet clothes after bathing, and the Bai Zhu Decoction is recommended.</p>
<p>For hot coughs with a dry, painful throat, and nasal discharge of hot air, where phlegm is difficult to expel, yellow and thick, occasionally with blood streaks or a foul smell, or firm like clam meat, it is less favorable compared to wind-cold coughs where phlegm is clear and white.

The remedy is to take Lung Tonifying Decoction, half a dose, adding apricot kernel, fritillaria, winter flower, donkey-hide gelatin, and lily, each in equal parts, decocted, strained, and mixed with powdered milk.

<p>For those who have a persistent cough for years without resolution, having taken medicine without improvement and showing no other symptoms, distinguishable from labor-induced cough, the remedy should be San&#39;ao Decoction, supplemented with Qingjin Dan. </p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach are normal and diet is unrestricted, one may add flavored ginseng lung-clearing soup or ginseng and millet soup. For sudden cough that does not respond to treatment, one may take live deer antler pills or large dodder seed pills for healing.

<p><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>Coughing as an illness can be classified: if there is a cough with phlegm, it indicates that the spleen is strong against dampness, causing phlegm to be slippery. If there is a persistent cough that does not produce phlegm, it indicates that the lungs are dry, overpowering the phlegm and dampness. For the slippery type, one should use herbs like Nanzheng, Banxia, or Zaohua to dry the spleen, while avoiding remedies that promote Qi. For the dry type, one should use herbs like Zhike, Zisu, or Xingren to strengthen the lungs, while avoiding remedies that dry out the lungs. </p>
<p>If there is a lung cough accompanied by wheezing, leading to spitting blood, one should use Mahuang Decoction. If the cough is from the large intestine with uncontrollable bowel movements, one should use Chishizhi Yu Yuliang Decoction or Taoren Decoction; if it persists, use Zhuling Fen Shui San. </p>
<p>For a cough associated with heart pain and a sensation of obstruction in the throat, especially severe cases leading to throat blockage, use Jiegeng Decoction. A cough from the small intestine that results in loss of breath — if both breath and cough are lost — requires Shaoyao Gancao Decoction, which is due to the small intestine&#39;s connection to the heart. A cough from the liver with pain beneath the ribs, especially severe enough to prevent turning, indicates fullness below the ribs and should be treated with Xiao Chaihu Decoction.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

Danxi stated: A cough with hypochondriac pain should be treated by soothing the liver qi, using ingredients such as Qingpi, Zhihua, and Xiangfuzi; if there is fullness, the use of Baijiezi and similar herbs is indicated. For a cough with bile, which includes vomiting bile, Huangqin should be combined with Banxia and Shengjiang in a decoction. For a spleen cough, with pain in the right hypochondrium that can refer to the shoulder and back, which may be severe enough to hinder movement, the Shengma Decoction is recommended. For a stomach cough with vomiting, especially if severe enough to bring up long worms, Wumei Pills are appropriate. A kidney cough characterized by pain in the lower back that may also reflect in the throat, leading to coughing up phlegm, calls for a decoction of Mahuang with Fuzi and Xixin. For a bladder cough with incontinence, the Fuling and Guangcao Decoction is indicated. A cough associated with fullness in the three burners, where one lacks appetite, may require treatment for heat phlegm with the Xiaohanjiao Decoction or the Mengshi Pills, as well as methods to clear the diaphragm and transform phlegm; if it persists, one should consider methods to expel phlegm-heat. A pale face with sorrowful sneezing, or chest distension and pain, or thin, weak, or slow pulse with cough may indicate cold fluid in the chest and abdomen, which should be treated with warming spicy herbs. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Dry cough refers to a condition without phlegm but with sound. This symptom originates from Qi stagnation. In mild cases, one may cough several times before phlegm is produced; in severe cases, one may cough dozens of times without producing phlegm. This is what is referred to as a dry cough.</p>
<p>Coughing indicates sound, resulting from lung Qi damage and lack of clarity. &quot;Cough&quot; indicates phlegm, arising from spleen dampness. A cough occurs due to lung Qi injury and spleen dampness activation. Although the illness can be classified into the six energies and five organs, the key points all pertain to the lungs, which govern Qi and manifest sound. The treatment method must distinguish between new and chronic conditions, deficiency and excess. For new illnesses, if it is due to wind-cold, expel it; if it&#39;s due to fire-heat, clear it; if it&#39;s due to damp-heat, drain it. Chronic illnesses belong to deficiency or stagnation; if there is Qi deficiency, tonify Qi; if there is blood deficiency, tonify blood; if there is stagnation, dispel it; nourish, moisten, and consolidate are the methods for treating deficiency. </p>
<p>The prescription includes peeled bitter almonds, white poria (each one qian), tangerine peel (seven-fifths qian), five-flavor fruit, balloon flower root, and honey-fried licorice (each five-fifths qian). In spring, when the rising Qi is abundant, it is suitable to moisten the lungs and soothe the liver, adding chuanxiong, peony, and pinellia (each one qian), and fried ophiopogon, yellow qin (each five-fifths qian), and anemarrhena. </p>
<p>In spring, if there is a cough due to a cold with clear nasal discharge, it is advisable to use acrid and cool herbs, adding wind protective herbs, mint, fried yellow qin, and ophiopogon (each one qian). </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lung governs the skin and hair; if lung qi is deficient, the pores will not be tightly closed, allowing external wind pathogens to easily invade. The appropriate treatment is to release the exterior while also reinforcing lung qi. If there is excess heat in the lungs, the pores will not remain closed, and wind pathogens will invade from the outside. Treatment should focus on releasing the exterior while clearing lung heat; once the pathogen retreats, the treatment should stop. If dispersing treatments are frequently applied, this could severely deplete body fluids, leading to lung abscesses or atrophy. Therefore, when the lungs are invaded by pathogens and fail to transform and transport, resulting in insufficient urination, gradual swelling of the skin, and an increase in coughing, one should use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the spleen and lungs, and the Six Flavor Pill to nourish kidney fluids.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h1>Introduction to Medicine: General Discussion on Coughing</h1>
<p>Coughing is mostly a result of lung fire. Why is it associated with the symptoms of a solar disease in terms of cold damage? The lungs are the canopy of the five organs, internally connected to the bladder, externally governing the skin and hair, and are the master of qi. When qi rebels and does not descend, coughing occurs. When wind and cold invade, the qi becomes stagnant due to the cold; when heat pathogens invade, the qi becomes dry and obstructed. When fluid obstruction occurs, the interaction with qi can lead to phlegm, which is also a source of coughing. </p>
<p>In cases of wind and cold, if there is a solar syndrome with fever, vomiting, and wheezing, use Mahuang and Xingren Decoction; for coughing and wheezing, use San&#39;ao Decoction. In the lesser yang syndrome with chills and fever coupled with chest fullness or diarrhea, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus ginseng and jujubes, adding Schisandra and dry ginger. In the lesser yin syndrome with cold extremities, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, use Si Ni Decoction plus Schisandra and dry ginger; for lesser yin cough with vomiting, thirst, restlessness, insomnia, and diarrhea, use Zhu Ling Decoction.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In spring and winter, wind and cold cause harm; in summer and autumn, dampness and cold are damaging. Symptoms include nasal congestion and throat sounds, with qi obstructed, leading to coughing. For this condition, prepare a decoction of tangerine peel and bamboo shavings. If the cough is due to heat, use Jinfeicao Powder, Chaihu Banxia Decoction, or Xiebai Powder. If there is coughing up of phlegm with blood, use Xiao Chaihu Decoction with Huangqin and black beans. If coughing occurs with fever and fullness and pain in the abdomen, treat it with Da Chaihu Decoction. If there is fullness in the abdomen with vomiting, use Da Banxia Decoction. After a purging treatment, if there’s cold in the stomach with lack of appetite, use Lizhong Decoction or Liu Junzi Decoction, both with added Schisandra and Asarum. If phlegm and qi are excessive, use Da Tangerine Peel Decoction. For those with chronic phlegm-fire conditions, adjust with Qinjian Erchen Decoction.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are three patterns for water cough: Qinglong Decoction treats exterior cold water in the Taiyang stage, Shizao Decoction treats interior water stagnation in the Taiyang stage, and Zhenwu Decoction treats cold water in the Yin pattern. For all coughs with minor urination, sweating should be avoided, as prolonged issues can lead to internal damage. Those affecting the upper and lower jiao should not be treated.</p>
<p>Regarding the differentiation of coughs:</p>
<p>Coughing is caused by the movement of qi producing sound, while a “sou” (cough with phlegm) indicates blood transforming into phlegm. If lung qi is agitated, coughing occurs; if spleen dampness is involved, &quot;sou&quot; will happen. When both spleen and lung are affected, both coughing and “sou” arise. However, since the lungs are primary, coughing is more commonly referenced, with “sou” included within it.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Between Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>When coughing, one must first assess the condition of the lung pulses: if they are excess, they will be floating, large, and forceful; if they are sinking and slippery, then phlegm and qi are abundant. If they are deficient, they will be thin, large, and weak; if they are sinking, thin, and fast, then there is severe internal heat.</p>
<p><strong>External Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>If wind affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include nasal obstruction, a heavy voice, dry mouth, and itchy throat; one may cough before finishing speaking. Use Shen Su Decoction with mulberry bark and apricot kernels, or Chai Hu Ban Xia Decoction, followed by various cough pills. For chronic coughs, nighttime coughs, and winter coughs from wind entering the lung orifices, it is advisable to fumigate.</p>
<p>If cold affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include tightness in the chest and hoarseness; use Er Chen Decoction with ma huang and apricot kernels, or Su Chen Jiu Bao Decoction, Hua Gai Powder, or Dan Sheng Jiang Pills. For those with simultaneous cold and heat, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is recommended. There is a condition called &quot;cold and warmth reaction,&quot; where cold wraps heat, and relieving the surface will eliminate it. Use Zhi Geng Decoction with ma huang, fang feng, apricot kernels, chen pi, zi su, mu tong, and huang qin. For coughs at night due to wind, cold, and obstructed heat, use San Yao Decoction with zhi mu and huang qin.</p>
<p>If summer heat affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include dryness of the mouth, hoarseness, and foamy sputum; use Liu Yi San with cinnabar. If there is blood, use loquat leaf powder. </p>
<p>If damp affects the lungs causing cough, symptoms include heavy body and painful joints; use Wu Ling San or Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, in spring, the qi rises, nourishing the lungs and soothing the liver; in summer, the fire rises, clearing metal and lowering heat; in autumn, dampness and heat are severe, thus clearing heat and draining dampness; in winter, wind and cold are heavy, necessitating resolving the surface and transporting phlegm.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Internal Injury</strong></p>
<p>Fire cough with much phlegm and little sputum, if frequent at dawn, is caused by food accumulation with damp heat flowing into the lungs. Use Xiao Baitang (Spleen-reinforcing powder) with Zhimu, or the ancient Ermu powder. If there&#39;s frequent cough in the late morning, it&#39;s due to excess fire in the stomach; use Dan Shigao pills with Zhibei. For constipation, thirst, and thick phlegm, use Liangge powder, Baidu powder, or Guqin Ban pills. Frequent cough in the late afternoon indicates Yin deficiency; use Siwu decoction mixed with Erchen tang added with Zhimu, Huangbai, and Mai Men Dong to nourish and cool down. If there are signs of Yin deficiency with fire dryness, cold and heat, night sweats, or blood in sperm, use Siwu decoction with Zhu Li, or Zhi Yin Jiang Huo decoction, or the modified Ermu pills. If there&#39;s frequent cough at dusk, it indicates fire floating in the lungs; use Runfei pills to suppress it, and do not solely rely on cold medicines. Generally, use Erchen decoction without Ban Xia, adding Beimu, (Chinese herb: Tongcao), Qingdai, Shanzhi, Huangqin, and Sangbai Pi.</p>
<p>Stagnation cough is fire cough; if prolonged, it becomes a dry cough with no phlegm, indicating kidney water depletion, with evil fire burning in the lungs. Use Xiao Baitang with bitter stem as the chief drug to break it up. For prolonged cases, use Heli Wan; for deficiency, use Shenqi Wan; if unsuccessful, use Xiatian Gao. If there are dry lungs, dry skin, itchy sores, and constipation, aim to invigorate blood and moisten dryness; use Shengjin beverage.</p>
<p>Labor cough is a cough resulting from five types of labor. Exhaustion harms the liver; if there&#39;s cough with pain in the left rib and lower abdomen, use Erchen decoction with Xiong, Gui, Shaoyao, Qingpi, Chaihu, Longdant, Huangqin, and Zhuru, or Huangqi Jianzhong decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm and Fluid Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Phlegm cough occurs when phlegm is expelled, leading to cessation of coughing, and there is a feeling of fullness in the chest and diaphragm. The classics state: &quot;In autumn, one is harmed by dampness; in winter, cough is inevitable.&quot; Dampness located in the heart is called &quot;heat phlegm,&quot; in the liver is called &quot;wind phlegm,&quot; in the lungs is called &quot;qi phlegm,&quot; and in the kidneys is called &quot;cold phlegm.&quot; Only when damp phlegm enters the stomach and ascends to the lungs will coughing arise, for which Qianqin Decoction, Zhuifang Pill, or Banxia Pill may be selected. When phlegm obstructs the lung meridian, resulting in excessive sputum during cough or a feeling of fullness in the chest, Erchen Decoction plus Zhiling, Banxia, Huangqin, and Fritillaria is advised, and in severe cases, He Ding Dan should be considered. If phlegm accumulates in the lung region leading to prolonged coughing that disrupts sleep, Douling Pill is effective. If phlegm is caused by fire, Erchen Decoction plus Qinlian or Qingqi Huatan Pill should be used. If phlegm is caused by food stagnation, Huatan Pill is suitable; if caused by liquor dampness, Fengluo Pill is required; if caused specifically by alcohol, Banlian Pill is appropriate. If phlegm is significant and leads to difficulty in eating with constipation, Xiaochengqi Decoction can be administered; if unable to eat with constipation, Houpu Decoction or Guntan Pill should be used for relief. </p>
<p>For coughing due to fluid retention, arising from drinking tea or water, which results in sputum rising, along with heat in the body and fullness in the chest causing palpitations, Xiao Qinglong Decoction is recommended; for cold body and hardness in the flanks, Zhenwu Decoction is suitable; for chest fullness, Xiaobanxia Decoction; for constipation, Shizao Decoction; and for difficulty in urination, Wulingsan is advised.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Regarding Recent and Chronic Coughs</strong></p>
<p>For a recent cough with phlegm, it is caused by external factors and should be dispersed according to the season; if there is no phlegm, it indicates heat, and should be cleared. For a chronic cough with phlegm, it requires drying the spleen and transforming phlegm; if there is no phlegm, then clear the metal and reduce the heat. Generally, prolonged external factors lead to stagnant heat, while prolonged internal injury leads to fiery inflammation; both conditions need to be resolved and moistened. If there are emotional disturbances or Qi counterflow, then the priority should be to use Zhiqiao and Xiangfu to regulate Qi; if there is stagnation of water and food, then Nansheng and Bintang should be used to disperse. For those with blood deficiency, it should be nourished and contained. If the root cause is not treated and excessive use of Douling or Sushe pills is applied, it may instead lead to lingering conditions. Moreover, the lungs are delicate organs, susceptible to cold and heat. Although Ren Shen is a neutral herb, it is most suitable for Qi deficiency. If there is heat in the lungs or a strong wind pathogen, Sand Shen or Yuan Shen should be substituted. Thus, coughing does not only relate to cold conditions. Prolonged coughing can also arise from issues with bowel movements, fatigue, and fluctuations in hunger and fullness, leading to cold in the lung and stomach, causing reduced appetite; in such cases, treating the spleen will lead to cessation of cough. However, the kidneys manage Qi; if coughing triggers an upward surge of Qi from below the navel, it indicates kidney deficiency where Qi does not return to its source. In this case, the medicine should include Guben Zhi and Wuweizi, or Sanwei An Shen Wan. For those with Yin deficiency, use Shen Qi Wan; for those with Yang deficiency, use Heixidan to calm. In cases where cough leads to lung distension or throat ulcers resulting in loss of voice, it is critical.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Coughing Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essential Readings for Medical Scholars</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhongzi)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>A sound without phlegm is called &quot;cough,&quot; caused by the fire in the lungs. A sound with phlegm is called &quot;sough,&quot; caused by the spleen being invaded by dampness. When there is both phlegm and sound, it is called &quot;coughing.&quot;</p>
<p>Although coughing is primarily a lung issue, all five internal organs and six hollow organs can contribute to it. Analyzing its causes, the classical texts often miss certain meanings; in summary, it results from internal injuries or external pathogens. External factors such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness harm the exterior first, affecting the skin and hair, which relate to the lungs. If the lung pathogen is not resolved, it can lead to illness in other organs, which originates from the lungs.</p>
<p>Internal injuries caused by labor or emotional distress affect the internal organs, injuring the vital energy, and manifesting in the upper body via the yin aspect. This flows from the internal organs to the lungs. </p>
<p>Illness that enters from the exterior is a yang condition that should be treated with warm and pungent remedies to disperse the pathogen; thus the lungs clear and coughing resolves. Illness that arises from within is a yin condition that should be treated with sweet tonics to strengthen the water element and nourish the metal element; thus the lungs settle and fire-induced coughing resolves.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, when treating exterior conditions, it is inappropriate to use medications that are quiet and static; stagnation leads to unresolved symptoms and the emergence of other ailments. Therefore, one should avoid cold, cool, and astringent treatments, as mentioned in the &quot;Five Organs Generation&quot; chapter, which states that the lungs desire pungent remedies. Conversely, when treating internal conditions, medications that are active are unsuitable; activity can lead to unrest caused by excessive yang, and symptoms like dryness and itching may worsen. Hence, one should avoid pungent, aromatic, and hot treatments, as indicated in the &quot;Five Qi&quot; chapter, which states that pungent substances stir the qi, and one should not excessively consume them. </p>
<p>However, while treating exterior conditions, it is necessary to use methods that disperse pathogens. If there is a concurrent deficiency of the body&#39;s structure, one must also tonify the central qi and assist with harmonization. If one solely focuses on dispersion, there is a risk that the lung qi may become weaker, the pores may become more open, allowing pathogens to exploit the deficiency and exacerbate the illness. </p>
<p>In treating internal conditions, although tranquility is necessary to nourish yin, if the fire at the life gate is weak and cannot return to its original strength, then herbs like ginseng, astragalus, cinnamon, and aconite must be used.

If wheezing and coughing are present, along with facial swelling and shoulder breath, a large floating pulse indicates death. If persistent coughing leads to a weak pulse, survival is possible; if the pulse is strong and rapid, it indicates death. If wheezing occurs with either low or high coughing, a slippery pulse, and warm hands and feet, survival is likely. If the pulse is thin and the limbs are cold, it indicates death.

<p>In treating coughs, the use of Schisandra berries is beneficial as it helps to gather lung energy; it is an essential remedy for heat conditions. However, if there is an external pathogen present, its use should be cautious, as it may trap the pathogenic energy. One must first disperse the pathogen before employing it. The flavor of the Chebula fruit is sour and bitter, capable of astringing and reducing heat. Apricot kernels disperse wind-cold in the lungs, but they should only be used when there is true heat stemming from cold. Mulberry root bark drains lung energy, but it is not purely effective and users should be cautious. Aristolochia can eliminate lung heat while also nourishing the lungs. Fresh ginger is pungent and can promote dispersion. Poppy husks should not be used abruptly; they are meant for later astringent effects. Ginseng can be used when there is qi deficiency or new coughs are associated with weakness; however, it should not be used when there is strong wind-cold or long-standing coughs with stagnant lung fire. Loquat seeds are sweet and can nourish the lungs, moistening and helping to reduce phlegm in the chest.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Principles - Six Essentials</strong><br><strong>Ming - Zhang Sanxi</strong><br><strong>General Discussion on Coughing</strong>  </p>
<p>The five organs and six bowels, when there is turbid qi, become stagnant and turn into fire, which then inflames the lungs, causing one to cough; thus, the lungs are indeed the overseer. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: the lungs are the canopy of the five organs and six bowels, primarily governing qi. When the distinction between clean and turbid qi is made, there is no cough. If clean qi is not distinguished and turbid qi rises to disturb the canopy, compounded by water and stagnant fluids, the lungs cannot be cleared, resulting in a cough. Furthermore, examining the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: all five organs and six bowels can cause coughing, not just the lungs. Generally speaking, if there is external evil, stagnant fire, and phlegm and fluid attacking upward, with a pulse that is tense and slippery, it indicates a condition that can be treated. However, if one loses blood, and the pulse is hollow and rapid, with tidal fever and a flushed face, and especially if symptoms are severe in the afternoon, it may initially be treatable, but over time, if one becomes emaciated, it becomes hopeless.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing refers to throat clearing; in common terms, it is called a cough. The lungs govern qi, and when evil influences invade the lungs, the qi becomes obstructed and does not descend, resulting in coughing. There are different causes for coughing: some due to lung cold, some due to retained fluids, and some due to pathogenic influences present both exteriorly and interiorly. Each requires different treatments. Coughing from water accumulation presents three signs that must be distinguished. Xiao Qing Long Decoction addresses coughing due to exterior water; Shi Zao Tang addresses coughing due to interior water; Zhen Wu Tang addresses coughing due to yin-related water qi. When water combines with exterior cold and causes coughing, Xiao Qing Long Decoction should induce sweating; when water combines with interior cold and causes coughing, Zhen Wu Tang should warm it; when intestinal disturbances combined with water affect the lungs and lead to coughing, Shi Zao Tang should purgatively treat it.</p>
<p>In cases of Tai Yang disease with body heat and coughing, dry heaving, and diarrhea, Xiao Qing Long Decoction has a method for adjustments. Severe cold and body pain should follow the original formula. If the body feels cool with coughing and dry heaving leads to diarrhea, if there is distention under the heart and pain under the ribs, Shi Zao Tang is indicated. </p>
<p>For heaviness and pain in the limbs, abdominal pain with diarrhea, cough, or vomiting, Zhen Wu Tang has methods for adjustments. </p>
<p>In cases of Shao Yang disease with alternating chills and fever, a tight and painful chest, and coughing, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction has a method for adjustments. </p>
<p>For coughing in Shao Yang, Si Ni Tang is appropriate. If accompanied by abdominal pain and diarrhea, with coughing and fullness leading to vomiting, Da Ban Xia Tang should be used.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Meaning of the Terms Cough and Coughing</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there are references to both cough and coughing. For example, in the chapters on autumn injuring dampness, one chapter uses just the term &quot;cough,&quot; while another includes &quot;coughing.&quot; This indicates that cough and coughing are essentially the same. The &quot;Jade Machine&quot; distinguishes between yin, yang, qi, and blood, which is an overcomplication. According to the ancient &quot;Essentials of the Machine,&quot; coughing refers to a sound without phlegm, while coughing with phlegm means a sound accompanied by phlegm; if both are present, it is a combination of both. This is a minor distinction in terms, but the interpretation reverses their meanings.</p>
<p>Mr. He of the Bo Zhai states: the discussion of cough and coughing in the &quot;Essentials of the Machine&quot; is indeed a misinterpretation. The lungs govern qi and produce sound. When the lungs are injured by cold fluids, stagnation leads to phlegm, which obstructs the sound trying to ascend; thus, a sound arises from the struggle, and when phlegm is expelled along with sound, it is called cough. When external influences of wind and cold restrain the lung passages, the sound is not efficient, resulting in another kind of sound, which is called coughing. The character for cough (咳) derives from &quot;hai&quot; (亥), which signifies a tangible object, hence things like fruit seeds also derive from &quot;hai.” &quot;Hai&quot; also implies obstruction. The character for coughing (嗽), combines elements meaning to bind and to lack; this reflects the ingenuity of ancient character formation and is the reason these two conditions are differentiated.</p>
<p>Observing this, it indeed seems that the interpretation in the &quot;Essentials of the Machine&quot; is misapplied.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

These are external causes. </p>
<p>Persistent coughing due to dysfunction of the internal organs relates to the six bowels, indicating internal causes. If coughing triggers chills and fever, along with pain in the waist and back, or wheezing and fullness, it is due to sexual exhaustion harming the kidneys; if experiencing fullness and bloating in the abdomen, acute heart pain with loss of appetite, it is due to imbalance in eating harming the spleen; if coughing causes pain in the left flank radiating to the lower abdomen, along with pain in the knees and wrists, it is due to extreme fatigue harming the liver; if there is white phlegm with dry mouth and hoarse voice, it is due to shouting harming the lungs; if coughing leads to irritability, sweating, dry throat, and coughing up blood, it is due to mental strain harming the heart.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Reversal of Coughing</h3>
<p>Chao said: When the lungs are deficient, they are susceptible to slight cold, which leads to coughing. As one coughs, the qi gathers in the lungs, causing them to become distended; this is known as coughing reversal. When evil qi clashes with the righteous qi, the righteous qi cannot disperse and ascends to the throat instead. When the evil is dormant, the qi remains calm; when it becomes active, it rushes upwards, causing anxiety and despair, hence it is called coughing reversal with upward qi.</p>
<h3>Treatment Should Follow the Season</h3>
<p>In the summer, if the cough is hot, it is called a &quot;heat cough,&quot; treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction supplemented with gypsum and Zhimu. In winter, if the cough is accompanied by aversion to cold, it is termed a &quot;cold cough,&quot; treated with Xiao Qing Long Decoction plus apricot kernels and herbs like winter flower, fine xinyi, and dried ginger. Generally, regarding coughs, in spring when the qi rises, &quot;Za Zhu&quot; states it is advisable to moisten the lungs and suppress the liver, using Er Chen Decoction with apricot kernels, Zhimu, Schisandra, Chuanxiong, Baishao, Mai Men Dong, and fried Huangqin. For summer coughs, when fire flares up above, use Er Chen removing Ban Xia plus Wu Wei, Jie Geng, Sang Bai Pi, Di Gu Pi, Mai Men Dong, Huangqin, and gypsum, as well as fritillary bulb. In autumn, if damp heat injures the lungs, one should clear heat and drain dampness, using Er Chen Decoction, removing Ban Xia and adding apricot kernels, Tian Men Dong, Fang Feng, Jie Geng, Cang Zhu, Bai Zhu, Sang Bai Pi, Zhi Zi Ren, and Huangqin. In winter, if the cough is constrained by wind and cold, use dispersing methods; Er Chen Decoction supplemented with Ma Huang, Gui Zhi, Jie Geng, and apricot kernels. If there is fever and headache, add Chuanxiong, Xiaobai, Qian Hu, and Chai Hu.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Between Deficiency and Excess, New and Chronic</strong></p>
<p>In general, for those who cough and have weak body energy, using expelling medications is often ineffective; if they do work, the cough will likely return. For such cases, it is advisable to tonify and the cough will naturally resolve. For those with stronger body energy, the cough may be due to external pathogens, and in these instances, it is essential to disperse the evil Qi and break up the stagnation for the cough to calm. New coughs should be treated similarly to those from excess; chronic coughs should be treated with tonifying methods. One may also use harsh medicines to stimulate the sluggish return to health, such as those included in the Jiuxian San.</p>
<p><strong>Caution Against Using Astringent Medicines First</strong></p>
<p>In treating coughs, one must first identify the root cause of the illness and eliminate the evil Qi. Only afterward should one use astringent agents like Wu Mei, He Zi, Wu Wei Zi, poppy husk, and the like, which possess drying and astringent properties, to help constrict and seize. These are necessary and may lead to improvement with just one dose. Care must be taken not to alter the proper order of treatment.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Coughing and Hiccoughing</strong></p>
<p>Hiccoughing is similar to coughing. When there is an abundance of phlegm and fluid in the chest, coughing causes the qi to move within the phlegm, striking between the throat and the phlegm qi; as the coughing starts and stops, it produces sound, which is called hiccoughing. Both Zhongjing and Danxi say: when there’s a sound like that of a water hen in the throat, it can be treated with preparations like Xie Gan Ma Huang Decoction. Generally, it is similar to coughing, but when it comes to administering medicine, one should particularly use substances that resolve phlegm and break down fluids; this is the main difference.</p>
<p><strong>Discourse on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing refers to the presence of sound without phlegm, indicating injury to the lung qi leading to obstructed clarity. Hiccoughing refers to the presence of phlegm without sound, stemming from dampness in the spleen producing phlegm. Coughing and hiccoughing indicates phlegm accompanied by sound, as it originates from lung qi injury, and is influenced by spleen dampness, thus resulting in hiccoughing. The classics say that all five organs and six bowels have coughing; why is it that all organs can be implicated? Coughing is a symptom of disease; it can arise from external invasion or internal causes. External factors include wind, cold, heat, and dampness; internal factors comprise emotional conditions and issues of hunger and satiation. External wind, cold, heat, and dampness first invade through the skin and hair, which is the connection to the lungs; hence, although it&#39;s an external pathogen, it must first encounter this connection to affect the organs and result in hiccoughing, delineating it as an external invasion.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the seven emotions cause hunger or satiety and there are internal injuries, then evil qi rises upwards. The lungs serve as the pathway for the entrance and exit of qi, thus the evils of the five organs ascend to the lungs and result in coughing; this is a manifestation from within. However, there are cases of wind, cold, heat, and dampness that do not cause coughing; this is because the affliction is severe and directly injures the organs without affecting the skin. Similarly, the seven emotions may not lead to coughing when the illness is still mild, remaining within the original organ and not attacking upwards. Therefore, in treating cold damage, coughing is considered mild, while coughing caused by the seven emotions due to hunger and satiety may take a long time to manifest.</p>
<p>The treatment should carefully consider the pulse symptoms and the three causes. If the external factor is evil qi, the approach should be to disperse it, while also considering its deficiency or excess, cold or heat. If the internal cause is due to the seven emotions, one should follow the meridian corresponding to the affected area, aligning with the qi and pulse. Priority should be given to smooth the qi, and then address phlegm. If there is retention of fluids causing cough, digestive remedies should be used; one must avoid using drugs like black plum or opium poppy. If the cold evil has not been expelled, one should also refrain from using tonics.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

If heat is present, they will feel intense discomfort; if dampness affects them, they will feel sluggish.

<p>The primary methods for treating coughing: if the lung pulse is floating, it&#39;s afflicted by wind; disperse it. If the lung pulse is full, it indicates internal heat due to Qi stagnation; clear it. If the pulse is thin and scattered, it suggests lung deficiency; tonify the lungs to restore balance. For those who have had a prolonged cough and have experienced relief only to worsen, leading to cold in both the lungs and stomach, where food cannot be ingested, one should apply warming herbs to assist the stomach and use balanced remedies to treat the cough.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

<p>The lungs are responsible for the release of qi, while the kidneys control its intake. The lungs are the master of qi, and the kidneys are the foundation.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Treating Coughs</strong> </p>
<p>Coughing refers to the sound without phlegm, while a &quot;sough&quot; is with phlegm and sound. Although it differentiates among the six organs and five viscera, the main concern is always the lungs. The lungs are the organ of clear and empty, unable to hold even a small amount; a light tickle can trigger a cough. Furthermore, the lungs are delicate and sensitive to heat and cold; excessive heat causes coughing, while cold can also induce it. Therefore, when someone coughs, the lungs must be held accountable. </p>
<p>However, the treatment approach is not exclusively focused on the lungs but also involves the spleen, ultimately returning to emphasize the kidneys. The spleen is the mother of the lungs, and the kidneys are the child of metal; therefore, if there is deficiency, one should nourish the mother, and if there is excess, one should drain the child. </p>
<p>For example, if a cough arises from an external invasion of wind-cold, modern treatments often involve herbs like Ephedra, Bitter Orange, and Perilla to disperse the exterior pathogens, theorizing that if the illness starts from the exterior, it must also exit through the exterior. If both form and qi are robust, often a sweat can remedy the issue. However, if the form and qi are slightly deficient, it is best to prioritize tonifying the spleen while also assisting with herbs that release the exterior. </p>
<p>Why is this? The lungs govern the skin and hair; if they are deficient, the pores will not be tightly sealed, making it easy for wind pathogens to enter. If the lungs are not deficient, how could pathogens enter? Hence, the ancients included ginseng in the Ginseng and Perilla Decoction and added peony and licorice in the Cinnamon Twig Decoction, combining exterior-releasing herbs with those that fortify the spleen. When the spleen is strong, the lung metal has nourishment, and the skin has defense; any invading pathogens are easily expelled, preventing further invasions.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the treatment focuses solely on the surface, then the lung qi becomes more deficient, and the pores become more lax. When external pathogens take advantage of this, when will it ever cease? One must use ginseng, astragalus, and licorice to replenish the spleen, along with cinnamon twig to drive away evils. This I say is treating the spleen rather than the lung; when deficient, one supplements its mother. The &quot;Ren Zhai Zhi Zhi&quot; states: The lung expels qi; the kidney receives qi. The lung is the master of qi, while the kidney is the root of qi. In cases of sudden, severe cough that causes disturbance in the body, with the sensation of qi rising from the lower abdomen upwards, this indicates kidney deficiency unable to contain qi. The treatments should focus on the Earth Yellow Pill or the An Kidney Pill, not merely on the lung. This is the principle of supplementing the child when there is deficiency of the mother. Furthermore, I have another statement. Among the five elements, only the lung and kidney are involved, where the mother becomes strong and the child suffers from evil.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is it? The lung governs qi. If the lung has heat, the qi becomes heated and rises, unable to descend to nourish the kidney, and thus the kidney becomes afflicted by pathogens. Once the kidney is affected, the lung&#39;s condition worsens. Why is this so? It is because the mother houses the child, and the child is hidden within the mother’s womb. In humans, the lung, which is of metal qi, returns to be stored in the kidney’s water at night when lying down. Now, if the lung suffers from the evil of heart fire, and attempts to descend to avoid the water, but the kidney&#39;s water is dried up, there is no place for the fire to reside, which leads to it rising again and causing illness. </p>
<p>Those with fire burning the lung metal, leading to cough, should clear metal and lower fire. In current medical texts, those discussing the clearing of metal and lowering of fire suggest using Scutellaria, Ophiopogon, and Morus alba to clear lung metal, while Coptis is used to lower heart fire, gypsum to reduce stomach fire, and herbs like Four Substance Decoction, Phellodendron, and Anemarrhena to reduce yin fire; they also recommend using Zhi (bitter orange) and Banxia (pinellia) to dispel yin damage, favoring the use of Fritillaria, (Baihe) lily, bamboo juice, and loquat leaves to moisten the lung and transform phlegm. Are these treatment methods not straightforward and reasonable? Little do they know that the rationale for clearing metal and lowering fire seems correct but is, in fact, mistaken.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To supplement the north, is precisely to drain the south; to nourish its yin is to decrease the fire. Do we not observe how the master of water, Qi Yuanzi, conquers the yang light? In my discussions on fire theory and the nourishing yin and descending fire theory, I have already detailed the inappropriateness of using herbs like Huangbo and Zhimu, along with the harms of cold and cooling medicines. I have more to say. Wang Jiezhai states that excessive alcohol and colors harm the true yin of the lungs and kidneys; therefore, one should not take Ren Shen (Ginseng) or Huang Qi (Astragalus) excessively, as it could lead to death, fearing that the yang may become too strong and the yin may diminish. Since this view took hold, those treating yin deficiency coughs regard Ren Shen and Huang Qi as poison, turning to Huangbo and Zhimu as miraculous elixirs, leading those afflicted to take these medicines with nearly no chance of recovery—which is truly tragic. Those who can restrain desires and avoid medications can often prolong their lives. It can be seen that the disease is not untreatable, but rather that the treatment methods are improper. The disease fundamentally arises from excessive sexual exertion, which depletes the true yin. When the yin is deficient, the fire rises; when the fire rises, it harms metal, resulting in cough, which inevitably damages metal further. I first use medicines that bolster the master of water, like Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill), to replenish the true yin, allowing water to rise and fire to descend; then I utilize lung-nourishing medicines, such as Ren Shen and Huang Qi, to supplement the mother of the kidneys, creating a cycle where metal and water support each other, thus facilitating recovery from illness. Those who use cold and cooling methods are shallow and mediocre; they need not be mentioned. Occasionally, there are those who know to use Ren Shen and Huang Qi, yet do not recognize the necessity to first bolster water to restrain fire, hastily using Ren Shen and Huang Qi to supplement the yang, which only strengthens the yang fire further, causing even more harm to metal. Is it truly the fault of the medicine? This is what we refer to as the failure to recognize the proper order.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen and stomach are initially deficient, the earth is unable to control water; water overflows and turns into phlegm, causing the child to seize the mother and cough. Also, if the condition starts from heart fire attacking metal due to mistakenly consuming cold substances, it can injure the spleen, further weakening the lungs and resulting in cough. This involves the position of fire being below, with water qi supporting it, leading the child to rescue the mother, as kidney water regains the fire&#39;s offense. Cold water, mixed with the wood force, ascends to invade the lungs and stomach, hence the cough arises from cold water affecting metal. If the previous illness is not resolved, the new illness worsens. If a rough practitioner does not understand this principle, they might wrongly believe that phlegm-fire is hard to eliminate and that cold must be increased, which could be dangerous! At this time, one must use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger to nourish the spleen and lungs, and the Eight Treasure Pill to supplement the earth mother, guiding water back to its source.

<p>The condition of coughing, when sought in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; is broad yet lacks key points; when sought in the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; it merely associates the five elements with phlegm and drinks afterward, yet presents no profound discussions. Unable to avoid consulting the sages of later generations, the so-called precious gems do not lack thorough examination in the literature, but ultimately, each speaks their own sound and rarely converge. If I do not pass down vague and ephemeral ideas to later generations, what words shall I convey? I have often revisited the texts of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: &quot;What causes coughing in the lungs?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;All five organs can cause coughing; it is not solely the lungs.&quot; This one statement opens up the discussion on lung coughing but seems to cover too broadly. If the topic of lung coughing had been initially presented in a gradual, detailed manner, there would be no doubts, and later generations would have established methods to follow. However, the sages merely expressed ideas that followed the text closely, slightly hinting at the beginnings. If one must consider every detail uniformly, it deviates from the essence only to fragment the discourse. Thus, reading the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; emphasizes grasping its key points. If one grasps the essence, a single statement suffices; if not, it splinters endlessly—how could this not apply specifically to the condition of coughing? The Yellow Emperor&#39;s directive to Lei Gong states: &quot;Not knowing to classify can lead to confusion, and can impede clarity.&quot;<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is well known that the method of analogy not only suffices to obscure the meanings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; but also to obscure the ultimate nature of the infinite and boundless. A tube can glimpse the heavens, and a gourd can measure the sea; the myriad texts of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; though extensive, can be comprehended and unified through a single analogy. As for the harsh illnesses that arise, they can be managed with ease, no further discussion is necessary. </p>
<p>Let us elaborate. Although Qi Bo mentions that all the five organs and six bowels can cause coughing, the primary focus is on the lungs. He later explains that the skin and hair are associated with the lungs. The skin and hair are the first to receive harmful qi; this evil qi enters through their connection. Cold food and drink, when affecting the stomach, travel through the stomach meridian to the lungs, causing the lungs to become cold; when the lungs are cold, the internal and external connect, allowing the evil to invade, resulting in a cough. This illustrates one aspect of how cold food and drink harm the lungs and clarifies the cause of coughs.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;internal and external evil combine&quot; is pivotal in the method of analogy, emphasizing its importance. The human body can have external evils, internal evils, evils that are both internal and external, external evils that have departed but internal evils that remain, and internal evils that have been resolved but external evils that are not yet cleared. By employing a single analogy, everything becomes clear and understandable. Why then do we fail to discern such matters early on, allowing them to worsen day by day?</p>
<p>As for external cold, it is the result of being affected by wind-cold; cold drinking is an internal injury caused by food and drink. When the formless evil of wind-cold enters the body and combines with the formless evil of food and drink, it will inevitably linger. Treating the external evil must be done externally; the internal evil must be expelled from below, yet they should not be treated together at the same time.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Golden Casket,&quot; the five directions ultimately do not stray from the formula of Xiao Qing Long Tang for adjustments, as discussed in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; with its corresponding formulas found in the &quot;Golden Casket.&quot; However, what is absent in both the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and the &quot;Golden Casket&quot; must be derived through comparisons; whence do we turn for this? Further investigation into summer heat and dampness reveals that these evils can provoke coughing. Indeed, when external pathogens infiltrate due to summer heat and dampness, they must combine with the inherent heat pathogenic forces, worsening the cough; therefore, it is advisable to resolve this with acrid and cooling remedies while also adapting the example of Xiao Qing Long Tang into Bai Hu Tang, incorporating elements like Tian Shui and Wu Ling.</p>
<p>Delving deeper into the aspect of fire, we can observe the complementary relationship between the sovereign and minister, apart from the internal and external interactions, which can frequently lead to coughing. Since the heart and lung coexist in the diaphragm, the heat of the heart can easily suppress the metal of the lung. However, the fire of the sovereign does not act proactively; it remains unyielding and, at times, exerts effort that leads to coughing, but ceasing heart activity naturally alleviates the coughing, thus not resulting in catastrophic situations. It is only when the ministerial fire rises and carries the sovereign&#39;s heat that it severely afflicts the lung, creating the most significant problems. To treat this, one might also draw parallels with examples from external and internal combined evils, controlling or redirecting the heat from below, effectively preventing widespread calamity.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing in the chest is a nuisance, caused by the reversal of kidney energy, which is influenced by the邪 (evil) disrupting the balance of the upper and lower parts of the body. However, the turbid yin qi rises and obstructs the clear yang, blocking the diaphragm and preventing the release of this disturbance. By driving down the turbid yin, the cough can naturally cease. </p>
<p>Furthermore, seeking a solution in dryness, there are no fixed attributes for the internal and external, upper and lower. It may be due to excessive sweating or vomiting leading to fluids leaking outward, or prolonged diarrhea depleting the yin. It could also result from deficient blood failing to nourish the muscles, or the essence and marrow being exhausted and unable to fill the bones, leading to the lungs becoming dry and the fire invading without restraint, causing an unending cough. At this time, it is crucial to generate fluids, nourish the blood, and replenish the essence. This can still be managed. </p>
<p>Failure to treat this will result in a dire condition: the vessel will be dry, cup emptied, hair and skin withered, muscles tense and nails brittle; coughing will cause pain in the chest and back, leading to discomfort in the sides, various qi stagnations, weakness, shortness of breath, vomiting; a sore throat with blood discharge, and various dangerous symptoms appearing in succession. What remedy can help nourish this scorched dryness? </p>
<p>The ancient texts state that continuous coughing with white blood indicates death; is this not due to the lung suffering from the dry heat and decaying, with the blood transforming into a paler hue? As for the coughs of the five organs and six bowels, the Inner Canon does not fully explain them; yet one can compare and connect their principles. The knowledge of an individual is limited; based only on cold, damp, and dry fire injuring the lungs and making broad comparisons, only provides a rough framework to stimulate understanding, while delving into the fundamental principles demands the efforts of future generations.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Continuation of the Discussion</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion on cough by Chang, comparing it to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; I find it insufficient and am not at ease. Therefore, I took the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; to ponder over, tirelessly throughout the day, and eventually came to a realization. I began to understand that the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; mentions cough in relation to phlegm and fluids, which holds profound significance. This is because cough must stem from phlegm and fluids, and among the five types of fluids, only the upper diaphragm fluid serves as the primary foundation for cough. When external pathogens enter and combine with it, they certainly provoke a cough; even without external pathogens, if the upper diaphragm fluid seeps into the lungs, it alone can cause persistent coughing. Moreover, if the upper diaphragm fluid is retained for a long time, the vital energy from the lower region may reverse and surge upward, making it even easier for external pathogens to combine with internal issues. Thus, due to the presence of upper diaphragm fluid, external pathogens can penetrate inward, and lower issues can rise; if the upper diaphragm fluid is not eliminated, the cough will never find tranquility. To dispel the upper diaphragm fluid, one should use the Ten Jujube Decoction, regardless of its potency. This applies not only at the onset of illness but also when the affliction has been prolonged; it is essential not to seek any alternative remedies. It is said: for those who cough, their pulse is taut and indicates the presence of fluid; the Ten Jujube Decoction is indicated for this. It rightly asserts that a tight pulse must urgently address the elimination of upper diaphragm fluid, which is easy to understand.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: If a person has a phlegm disorder, with a cough and chest pain, they do not die immediately. After one hundred days or a year, a decoction of ten dates is suitable; this can allow one to live despite their condition, effectively removing the phlegm. Is it not alarming and doubtful? Among people, who does not have phlegm in their chest? How is its harm so severe? Why must its removal require such effort? The diaphragm is governed by Yang energy, with the heart and lungs residing there. When phlegm obstructs this area, coughing occurs with lung movement, and agitation of the heart causes distress, leading to pain. When it presses on the interior, the nourishing and protective energies cannot flow, the spirit loses its anchor, resulting in sudden death. After one hundred days or a year without death, it is clear that Yang energy has not dispersed, and the spirit has not departed. Therefore, one must urgently remove the evil to stabilize the body&#39;s rightful condition; thus, the rigorous attacks are justified. By eliminating the Yin dampness, clarity can be restored. Compared to merely waiting for death, what is gained or lost? It is said: If a cough lasts for several years and the pulse is weak, it can be treated; if the pulse is significantly weak, death is certain. If the pulse is vacuous, one will suffer from the condition because the phlegm is inherently present in the chest. Treatment pertains to phlegm disorders. To treat the cough without addressing the phlegm reflects a hidden intention of Zhang Zhongjing that subtly reveals itself with a single thought. In fact, significant weakness results in an inability to control fire, leading to death.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Its weakness and emptiness are such that both the邪 and the正 are declining and can easily recover; hence it can be healed. It is said: If there is cough and shortness of breath, preventing lying down, Xiao Qing Long Decoction is the main remedy. This clarifies the signs of external and internal combined邪, with Xiao Qing Long being suitable for one specific condition. However, when using Xiao Qing Long Decoction, it must be noted that there is profound significance in its application; care must be taken to prevent excessive upward counterflow, which can greatly increase chaos and turbidity. If excessive upward conflict and turbidity arise, the cough cannot be tolerated. For injuries from cold, Da Qing Long Decoction is used; those without signs of Shaoyin can take it, while those with a faint and weak pulse should not, as it may cause the flesh to tremble and the tendons to shiver, leading to the loss of Yang. For mixed conditions, Xiao Qing Long Decoction is also employed, yet there are concerns that the Shaoyin kidney Qi is fundamentally weak, making it easy for the fire of the Chong and Ren meridians to reverse upward. When the Chong and Ren fire ascend, there is no cough but the increase of vexation and cough; moreover, with a prolonged cough, can one stir the upward counterflow? Indeed, the Chong and Ren meridians, along with the large network of the kidneys, originate from below the kidneys and emerge from within the womb. If the kidney is weak and cannot properly anchor below, the two meridians become constrained, pushing upward from the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Then, using Guìlìng Wǔwèi Gāncǎo Táng, first treat the counterflow qi. When the counterflow qi is low, but there is still coughing and chest fullness, it is because water is not dispersing in the diaphragm. If the condition changes again, remove the cassia and add dried ginger and asarum to treat the coughing fullness, which will then cease. Upon the third change, if there is renewed thirst and the counterflow qi reoccurs, treat with asarum and dried ginger as hot medicines, as this will initially cause thirst, but if the thirst subsides, it indicates a condition called Zhi Yin. The treatment for Zhi Yin should include emesis, which will necessarily lead to vomiting; for the vomit, take Ban Xia to eliminate the water, which will stop the vomiting once the water has been expelled. </p>
<p>Upon the fourth change, if the person appears swollen, it indicates that water remains on the surface, so add apricot kernels to address this. The symptoms suggest administering Ma Huang internally; however, since the person is experiencing blockages, it should not be administered internally. If administered contrary to this, it will certainly lead to counterflow. This happens because the person is blood deficient, and Ma Huang promotes its yang. </p>
<p>Upon the fifth change, if the face is hot like one who is drunk, this indicates stomach heat rising up to the face, and the addition of Da Huang will help to relieve this. Ah! Zhongjing&#39;s treatment of cough is entirely not derived from the cough itself, but rather aims to dispel Zhi Yin, reduce the counterflow qi, and thereby address the methods related to counterflow qi. The approach is accomplished effortlessly, completely resolving the issue. Isn’t it miraculous? Previously, one could not grasp the author&#39;s intent and felt there was no elevation to be achieved. Who would have expected that by making comparisons, one could discover the interaction between external pathogens and internal issues, stemming from the principles outlined in the &quot;Jīng Kuì&quot;? The essence and insights are truly profound, could they not have been revealed by divine inspiration? How comforting!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Miscellaneous Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that in autumn, one is harmed by dampness, and in winter, coughing arises. This is a misrepresentation that has been passed down through the ages; I will correct it now. It says: Summer is harmed by heat; the long summer is harmed by dampness, leading to autumn inevitably experiencing fevers and chills. If autumn is harmed by dryness, coughing will arise in winter. The principle of the six qi corresponding to the four seasons is clearly elucidated. Dampness is linked to water, while dryness relates to fire. Damp diseases must stem from spring and summer, whereas dry diseases are more pronounced in autumn and winter. Fevers and chills are clearly symptoms of the combination of summer heat and dampness; yet dampness is more pronounced than heat. Why is it overlooked and not mentioned? As for coughing, it is entirely due to the manifestation of fire and dryness; why then is it considered a harm from dampness? Thus, in spring and summer, when there is much dampness, after the spring equinox, the earth&#39;s qi rises while the heavens&#39; qi falls, and the two energies interact, leading to dampness steaming within. The soil becomes moist and rich with water, and the human body responds to this, resulting in the manifestation of damp diseases.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In autumn and winter, when many suffer from dryness-related illnesses, after the autumn equinox, the weather does not cool down, and the earth&#39;s energy does not rise. The two energies separate, manifesting dryness; the grass turns yellow, trees shed leaves, mountains become rugged, and waters dry up. The human body responds to this, and dryness-related ailments appear. Thus, it is clear that coughs caused by dryness are indeed a manifestation of this condition!</p>
<p>The six qi (energies) govern illnesses: wind, fire, heat, humidity, dryness, and cold all affect the lungs and can lead to coughing. Coughing due to humidity is classified within the five energies of wind, fire, heat, dryness, and cold. Coughing due to wind brings sweating and headaches, with phlegm not flowing freely; coughing due to fire brings wheezing, urgency, and possibly blood in nasal discharge; coughing due to heat leads to wheezing, red face, tidal fever, and in severe cases, extreme heat internally while the extremities feel cold, causing uncontrollable diarrhea; coughing due to dryness results in dry skin, small itchy sores, and constipation; coughing due to cold causes chills with no sweating, nasal congestion, body aches, and irritability.</p>
<p>As for coughing caused by damp phlegm internally, it must be due to the influence of wind, fire, heat, dryness, or cold, with each case having different characteristics. However, the effect on the lungs remains the same.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When harmed by dryness, the lungs are the first to be affected. Coughing is the primary illness of the lungs, with various manifestations. If the cough rises up, it is a sign of dryness. If it leads to weakness, it indicates that the lung metal is depleted by the liver wood; if it leads to a blockage, it means the lung qi is reversed and doesn&#39;t circulate, resulting in extreme dryness. This is due to internal heat from dryness, where metal does not cool and water does not chill, which means autumn and winter cannot store up, just as spring cannot flourish—it is indeed quite distant from each other! </p>
<p>Coughing from external influences is caused by the six evils, which can accumulate and turn into fire due to the interaction of the six evils. When they internally harm the five organs and the five pathogens clash, it creates different conditions. Furthermore, there are methods of contraction and dispersal: contraction refers to gathering lung qi; dispersal refers to dispersing cold evils. If dispersal is needed but contraction occurs, then the lung&#39;s cold evil is confined for a time, causing significant harm. Conversely, if contraction is needed but dispersal happens, the lung&#39;s qi becomes weak and scatters, allowing righteous qi to leak out, which is harmful as well. </p>
<p>For instance, if a cough from wind has already dispersed and the surface is weak, if cold evil is reintroduced, the interaction of the weakened and evil forces can lead to wheezing. If you wish to disperse the wind, it may worsen the weakness in the lungs; if you wish to contract, it may worsen the stagnation of the evil. Therefore, one should first lightly disperse and then gradually contract, so the lungs do not become weak, and the evil does not become stagnant, thus stopping the wheezing and cough on its own. </p>
<p>This concludes the six guidelines.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>Coughing is a symptom that I have observed various scholars complicate with excessive arguments, leading to confusion for future generations in diagnosing and treating it. From my perspective, the essence of coughing can be distilled into two main categories: external causes and internal injuries. </p>
<p>What are these two categories? First, there is external aggression; second, there is internal deficiency, and that is all there is to it. Coughing due to external causes must originate from the skin and hair, as these are connected to the lungs. When external pathogens invade, they must first enter through the lungs. If the condition persists and does not improve, it will eventually affect the five internal organs. </p>
<p>Coughing due to internal injury arises primarily from the deficiency of the yin. The lungs are associated with dryness (metal) and are the source of water. When the yin is depleted from below, the yang is left isolated above; this results in dryness affecting the lungs. When the lungs are dry, they become itchy, leading to persistent coughing. </p>
<p>In summary, although there are many types of coughs, they ultimately stem from lung issues, which can be categorized into these two types. However, it is essential to differentiate between yin and yang and to discern between deficiency and excess. External coughing is attributed to yang pathogens, which enter from the outside; therefore, treatment should involve warming and dispersing, allowing the pathogens to scatter. Conversely, internal coughing is due to yin deficiency, where the yin energy is impaired from within; in this case, treatment should focus on sweet and neutral substances that nourish the yin, enabling the cough to resolve. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, if there is an excess of external pathogens involved, even within an internal deficiency, treatment should involve a combination of nourishment and dispersion.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of internal injuries, many ailments are insufficient; if there&#39;s a deficiency that includes a fullness, it should also be addressed with clarity and moisture. Generally, the causes of coughing stem from this; by seeking it here, one obtains the root, making treatment responsive. How can there be confusion like the ten cough syndromes of the Chao family or the three causes of cough of the Chen family, which only serve to confuse people&#39;s minds and provide no relief? Those who pay attention will understand this meaning well. </p>
<p>The classics say: the lungs cause coughing. They also state: the five organs and six bowels can all cause coughing; it is not only the lungs. Furthermore, it is said: the skin and hair first receive the pathogenic energy, which combines with the harmony. It is also mentioned that each of the five organs suffers illnesses at their appointed times, and not all can transfer their conditions to each other simultaneously. Therefore, when coughing arises from the five organs, it is transmitted through the lungs, making the lungs the primary organ while the others are supplementary. Thus, the five organs and six bowels each have their signs, distinguished by their accompanying symptoms. </p>
<p>When there are accompanying symptoms, there should also be combined treatments. Even with combined treatments, the emphasis remains on the lungs, which is self-evident. However, there still remains a viewpoint. It suggests that coughing due to external pathogens and coughing due to internal injuries have different origins and require different treatments. In external coughs, the onset is in the lungs, thus it must arise from the lungs to the other organs, making the lungs the source and the other organs the signs. In internal coughs, the initial cause is the injury to the other organs; therefore, it must arise from the other organs to affect the lungs, with the other organs as the source and the lungs as the sign.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat internal injuries, one must not only focus on the lungs without understanding how to treat other organs; otherwise, how can the true yin be restored? Without the restoration of yin, the cough will never heal. When treating external conditions, one must not neglect the yang and mistakenly treat the yin; otherwise, how can the evil qi be resolved? If the evil is not dispelled, the cough will remain unrelieved. The classics state: to treat illness, one must seek its root. Why is it that modern people cannot discern this?</p>
<p>Regarding the labor wind syndrome, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that the treatment for heat-related illness requires attention to the lungs. This condition causes people to feel weak, with cloudy vision, and phlegm that resembles mucus, alongside an aversion to wind and chills; this is the disease of labor wind. Those who are robust recover in three days, middle-aged individuals in five days, and the weak in seven days. Coughing up green and yellow phlegm that appears like pus and is as large as a pellet, emerging from the mouth as if from the nose; if it does not come out, it harms the lungs, and lung damage will lead to death.</p>
<p>Labor wind syndrome refers to the effects of overexertion leading to wind exposure. People who exert themselves will have their pores open and sweat to flow, making it easy for wind evil to invade. Many modern cases of wind-injury present this syndrome. Thus, those with mild cases recover in three to four days, while severe cases take five to seven days, ultimately expelling turbid phlegm like mucus before healing, which indeed belongs to the category of labor wind. However, if treated according to the methods for external conditions, recovery is assured.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

<p>Coughing can arise from external pathogens as well as from internal injuries; one condition is real, the other is虚 (deficient), so treatment must be discerning. Cough due to external pathogens is usually caused by an exposure to wind and cold, leading to symptoms that may include chills and fever, or breathlessness, nasal congestion with a heavy sound, headaches, and phlegm.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The symptoms may include night fevers and heat sensations, weight loss, persistent redness in both cheeks, shortness of breath, dry throat, and a pulse that is either light and rapid or thin and tight. Coughs due to external factors appear suddenly, while those from internal deficiencies develop gradually. Coughs caused by external factors are due to cold evils, whereas those from internal injuries arise from Yin deficiency. External coughs may be treated with warming or dispersing methods, making them easier to manage; internal coughs require tonification and harmonization, which complicates their treatment. This is the distinction to be made. However, there are cases where individuals with weak pulses suddenly contract external illnesses, and strong individuals may suffer from internal injuries. In these ambiguous situations, one should closely observe the cause of illness and pulse characteristics to discern the appropriate responses. If one misdiagnoses the condition and treats it incorrectly, it could lead to serious consequences, so caution is advised.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for External Cough Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>External coughs occur at any time and are fundamentally caused by cold evils. Cold follows the seasonal climate and invades the lungs, so the treatment for coughs is to use warm excitants to disperse the evils, with Liugan Decoction plus fresh ginger being the most effective. For all cases of external afflictions, it is essential to use this decoction, adjusted as necessary. If there is dryness in the lung area with phlegm and air not flowing well, or if the patient is elderly or blood is deficient causing difficulty in coughing, add two to three qian of angelica root to this formula. If cold evils are too intense or if the lung qi is not warm enough to dispel the evils, add seven to eight fen or one qian of northern fine herb to this formula. If in winter when the cold is severe and qi is blocked, making it hard to disperse the evils, add ephedra and cinnamon twig or use Xiao Qing Long Decoction.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one suffers from a wind injury with cold, or a cold injury with wind, accompanied by alternating chills and fever, and a persistent cough, it is advisable to use a decoction of Chai Chen as the primary treatment. If the cold pathogen is not severe and the phlegm and qi are not abundant, simply adjusting the Er Chen Tang will suffice for treatment, and there will be no lack of cures.</p>
<p>Coughs caused by external factors, particularly in those with yin deficiency and little blood, or those with spleen and lung cold deficiency, are most susceptible to pathogens. However, if one observes that the pulse is slightly weak, there is no obstruction in the chest, or if kidney qi is insufficient leading to fluid accumulation as phlegm, or heart conditions manifesting as nausea and lack of appetite, or if one is middle-aged and experiencing gradual weakness of blood and qi, resulting in a cough that cannot be cured, it is advised to use the Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction with adjustments.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment of Internal Injury Cough</h3>
<p>All coughs resulting from internal injuries must originate from the Yin portion. What is the Yin portion? It is the essence and energy of the five organs. Although all five organs possess essence and energy, the kidney is the source of primordial essence, and the lung is the master of primordial energy. Therefore, when the energy of the five organs is harmed, the disease will manifest itself from above downward, starting from the lung and spleen, ultimately reaching the kidney; when the essence of the five organs is harmed, the disease will rise from below upward, starting from the kidney and spleen, ultimately reaching the lung. If both the lung and kidney are afflicted, the other organs will not be spared. Hence, cough resulting from overexertion is the most difficult to treat, precisely because its root cause is deep-seated and not easily influenced.</p>
<p>When the disease is rooted, can it not be treated by simply addressing the symptoms? Therefore, to treat what is above, one must not focus on the symptoms above but on those below; to treat what is below, one must not focus on the symptoms below but on those above. Understand that within Qi lies essence; the lung, belonging to the metal element, is a light and empty organ. When metal is subjected to the fire&#39;s burning, it results in cough; likewise, when metal is cold and water is icy, it also leads to cough; thus, coughs must be treated in the lung. However, coughs stemming from internal injury are not solely present in the lung. The essence of all five organs is stored in the kidney, and the lesser Yin kidney channel extends from the kidney, penetrating through the liver diaphragm and entering the lung, tracing up the throat and surrounding the base of the tongue. Hence, the weakness of lung metal is often due to the depletion of kidney water, with the child (lung) weakening the mother (kidney).</p>
<p>Therefore, in treating cough due to overexertion, it is essential to prioritize strengthening water and nourishing Yin, so that the lung&#39;s energy can be replenished, allowing the cough to gradually improve.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One should appropriately use formulas like Yiyin Decoction, Zuo Gui Pill, and Liu Wei Di Huang Pill. If there is a deficiency in the original yang, leading to a lack of vitality causing the spleen to be constrained below and the lungs to be burdened above, resulting in symptoms like wheezing, fullness, phlegm, nausea, and diarrhea with aversion to cold, then if the pulse is fine and weak, and signs of deficiency and cold are present, and the cough persists, it is not necessary to treat the cough directly; instead, one should tonify the yang, and the cough will cease on its own. Medicines such as You Gui Decoction, You Gui Pill, Ba Wei Di Huang Pill, Da Bu Yuan Decoction, Liu Wei Hui Yang Decoction, Li Zhong Decoction, and Jie Lao Powder should be used promptly based on necessity, and should not be delayed to prevent deeper complications.</p>
<p>For cough caused by internal injury, if there is a deficiency of water below and fire excess above, leading to fire damaging the lung metal and resulting in a dry cough, heat and pain in the throat, mouth sores with tidal fever, constipation with a preference for cold, and a rapid, slippery pulse, it is essential to also clear the heat to preserve the water; thus, Si Yin Decoction or a modified Yiyin Decoction, or Ren Shen Gu Ben Pill should be employed. This should be considered alongside cases of coughing blood, with detailed treatment methods referenced in the section on blood conditions.</p>
<p>For a hoarse cough, since the lung is associated with metal, when metal is strong it does not resonate, and when it is damaged it also does not resonate. A strong metal signifies that there is evil in the lung, either cold evil or fire evil. A damaged metal suggests that the true yin is compromised, which may be due to either qi deficiency or essence deficiency. For cold evil, warming and spicy remedies should be used; for fire evil, sweet and clarifying remedies should be indicated.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those with Qi deficiency should tonify Yang, while those with Jing deficiency should tonify Yin. Generally, if the condition is due to an external evil and is acute, treatment is easier. If it stems from deficiency, the onset is gradual, and treatment is more difficult. </p>
<p>For treating deficiency, methods should be combined with those for post-cough conditions. Cough from internal injury due to deficiency should not use drying medicines or aromatic stimulating agents like Liu&#39;an or Erchen, which should be used sparingly. Instead, one should use sweet and moistening substances to nourish Yin, such as cream, honey, lily, rehmannia, donkey-hide gelatin, ophiopogon, and peeled walnuts.</p>
<p>External evil conditions are often mistakenly thought to be caused by overexertion, leading to genuine exhaustion. This is particularly true for those whose Qi is weak and soft, where physicians might misinterpret symptoms of fever as heat and coughing as exhaustion, not distinguishing between exterior and interior issues, thus improperly using Yin-nourishing and fire-reducing medicinals. </p>
<p>It is unknown that if cold evil is already present externally, cooling medicines should not be recklessly prescribed. If there is both external cold and internal cold, it will result in a combined evil, which will cause the condition to persist and worsen. </p>
<p>Common sayings indicate that a cold or wind attack that doesn’t resolve can turn into exhaustion. However, how can a cold truly transform into exhaustion? It is merely due to the mismanagement of inept doctors that leads to daily deterioration. A frail person cannot withstand continual purging; if it remains unresolved for a long time, it can potentially become exhaustion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when diagnosing this condition, one must closely examine both superficial and internal factors, as well as the distinctions between new pathogens and chronic illnesses, along with pulse, complexion, and bodily signs. If the true nature is determined, a few doses of Six An Decoction, Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction, or similar formulations can cure it. The inaccuracy of a physician is one of the reasons for failure.</p>
<p>In the case of a dry cough, Danxi states: the fire is severely constrained. This indicates phlegm and fire stagnation in the lungs. One should use bitter herbs to open it up and utilize tonifying methods to lower the fire. If this does not relieve the condition, it may progress to consumptive illness, necessitating the use of the reversing method. This symptom commonly affects those who feel unfulfilled. However, I believe Danxi&#39;s interpretation is quite different. If it is said that one feels unfulfilled, then their worries and thoughts may lead to internal injury, which is not merely phlegm and fire illness, nor should it be treated with bitter herbs or the reversing method.</p>
<p>A dry cough arises from insufficient fluids in the lungs, indicating internal deficiency. When the lung and kidney are not in harmony, qi cannot produce fluids, and essence cannot transform into qi, resulting in this dryness. It is essential to distinguish whether there is excess fire or not. If there is no fire in the organs, it is simply due to lung deficiency, thus one must first tonify qi to generate essence, suitable for prescriptions like Five Blessings Decoction. If the organ&#39;s qi is slightly cold, it cannot be moistened without pungent herbs, so supplementing yang will generate yin; therefore, yin-regulating decoctions or Liu Jun Zi Decoction are appropriate.</p>
<p>If there are internal heat and fire, it is essential to preserve the true yin; thus, one must first strengthen water to control fire, recommending Yi Yin Decoction or a modified version, potentially combined with a pill containing Fritillaria. If one only focuses on resolving phlegm and relieving stagnation in this condition, they will see the qi deplete further and water become more deficient, ending up like a fish stranded in a dry rut.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The foolish observer Hejian believes that in treating cough, one should first address phlegm, hence using Nanning and Banxia as the main remedies, thinking he has found a method to treat cough. His reasoning implies that cough must originate from phlegm; thus, overcoming phlegm will naturally resolve the cough. However, this logic is flawed. </p>
<p>Coughs caused by external pathogens must arise from wind and cold; when wind and cold are present in the lungs, lung qi becomes obstructed, leading to cough, which in turn stirs up phlegm. Therefore, the root of cough from wind is based on external factors, not the other way around. Similarly, coughs caused by internal injury are always due to yin deficiency; with yin deficiency, fluids become depleted, and organs become exhausted, which leads to cough, while spleen deficiency and kidney weakness result in phlegm formation. Hence, the source of cough from yin deficiency originates in internal injuries, not from phlegm itself.</p>
<p>Thus, to say that cough should first be treated by addressing phlegm is surely not seeking the root cause! When treating cough from external factors, the most effective remedies are those belonging to the Erchen category. Why is that? It is because remedies like Nanning, Banxia, ginger, aged tangerine peel, and bitter orange are all spicy in flavor. Spiciness can penetrate the lungs and disperse cold; when cold is dispelled, phlegm cough resolves itself—this is truly a treatment that addresses the root cause, not merely treating phlegm. However, for coughs due to internal injuries involving yin deficiency, spicy and drying remedies are strictly contraindicated. Can such remedies be casually employed?</p>
<p>The classic states: the lungs require spiciness, which should be used to purge them. This applies to those with excess lung conditions needing spice. It also states: spiciness promotes qi; if there is a qi illness, one should not consume too much spice. This warns those with deficient lung conditions against spiciness. Thus, the principles regarding flavors and medicinal properties are expertly elaborated in the Inner Canon. Why does Hejian fail to comprehend this and claim that Nanning, Banxia, and similar remedies can solely treat phlegm? Can it truly be that addressing the surface symptoms of phlegm can resolve the fundamental issues of cough?<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

<p>The symptoms of lung cough stem from lung deficiency, which must be treated by nourishing the lungs. However, it is also necessary to treat the kidneys. This is because the essence of the lung, as metal, returns to the kidneys at night, analogous to the bond between mother and child; although the mother may wander outside, she must return to her child&#39;s home at night for rest. If the lung metal is injured by heart fire, it must seek help from its child to defend against this fire attack. If the child is impoverished, how can they repay their mother’s efforts?</p>
<p>There is a prescription for this: use one tael each of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, four qian of shan zhu yu, five qian of yuanshen, one qian each of perilla, asparagine, licorice, and achyranthes, three qian of adenophora, and five fen of purple aster, decocted in water and taken as a remedy. The effectiveness of this prescription lies in the strong nourishment of kidney water while minimally clearing lung metal; thus, the child thrives while the mother can repay her efforts.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also remedies to dispel evils; when used appropriately, they do not deplete the lung’s vitality at all. For example, when a child gathers friends, all of whom offer heartfelt support, any verbal attacks do not burden the resources of the mother. Thus, though the child&#39;s adversary may still exist, external hostility retreats at the mere mention of it, and they dare not repeatedly invade the mother’s home. This is also a subtle method of treating both the lungs and kidneys together. </p>
<p>In cases of dry cough, if the lungs have already been harmed, further complications like coughing up blood and pus will surely lead to death! Yet the desire to live can cloud judgment! It is not recognized that dry conditions causing a cough originate from external factors, not internal injuries. Even the expectoration of pus and blood arises from lung damage through coughing. To save the cough while nourishing the lung&#39;s essence, when the cough ceases, the pus and blood will also dissipate. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person has been suffering from a persistent cough for a long time, it is universally believed to be caused by an accumulation of pathogens. Why do everyday dispersing medicines fail to produce results? The reason is that the vital energy is dispersed. Once the vital energy is scattered, continuing to use dispersing medicines understandably leads to no effect even after months. The correct approach is to use one or two doses of astringent medicine to see success. </p>
<p>The prescription includes: one qian each of ginseng, white mustard seed, northern schisandra, and perilla seeds; three qian of white peony root; two qian of sour jujube seed; five qian of ophiopogon root; and five fen of fructus amomi. Prepare and take it as a decoction. One dose is light, two doses lead to complete recovery. Then, take the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pills, adding three liang of ophiopogon root and one liang of northern schisandra to the mix. If taken, the condition will not recur; otherwise, it cannot be prevented. </p>
<p>Long-term use of dispersing medicines depletes the essence of the true yin. Even if astringent medicines are temporarily effective, once the true yin is diminished, the pores are not tight. When exposed to wind pathogens, one becomes easily susceptible – this is an inevitable consequence. Taking the Rehmannia Pills nourishes the lung metal and maintains moisture, making one less susceptible to severe wind pathogens.</p>
<p><strong>Prescription: Houpo Mahuang Decoction (Zhongjing)</strong>  </p>
<p>For treating cough with a floating pulse:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Five liang of magnolia bark  </li>
<li>Four liang of ephedra  </li>
<li>One piece of gypsum the size of a chicken egg  </li>
<li>Half sheng of apricot kernels  </li>
<li>Half sheng of pinellia  </li>
<li>Half sheng of schisandra  </li>
<li>Two liang each of dried ginger and asarum  </li>
<li>One sheng of wheat</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare with one dou and three sheng of water. First, cook the wheat until soft, then strain it. Add the other herbs and simmer until three sheng remain. Take one sheng warm, three times a day.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

For a dry mouth and throat, use tea to wash it down. </p>
<p>Moreover, it is sung: &quot;For years of coughing, hard to treat, avoid foolish doctors, don’t waste your money; finely crush winter flowers into powder, burn the smoke, and inhale it down your throat.&quot;</p>

<p>For a cough that makes one feel near death: Use thick elm bark, shaved to the size of a finger and over a foot long; insert it into the throat and repeatedly pull it in and out, which will cause sputum and blood to be expelled, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>For a cough lasting ten to twenty years without responding to treatment: Take three live turtles, prepare them as if cooking food. Remove the intestines, add five liters of water, boil down to three liters, then soak four liters of fermented glutinous rice as usual and drink it all; this will prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Additionally: Use one live turtle, place it in a basin, let someone urinate on it for three days, then boil and grind it. Mix the powder with one liter of good wine and take it in one sitting; a moment later, one will expel phlegm and recover. For children, reduce the amount by half.</p>
<p>For phlegm and cough: Use genuine clam powder, stir-fried in a new tile until red, then add a little indigo, and mix with thin salt water and a few drops of sesame oil; take two qian (a measure).</p>
<p>For upper respiratory cough: Take four taels of pig fat, boil until bubbling, then eat it mixed with soy sauce and vinegar.</p>
<p>For a cough lasting twenty years: Take three pigs (referring to a reference term), one hundred jujubes, and soak them in five liters of wine; for autumn and winter, soak for seven days; for spring and summer, soak for five days. Strain and drink within seven days. Avoid salt.</p>

<p>In addition, a certain scholar from Yuet Province reported: In childhood I suffered from a severe cough that no medicines could cure.

<p>For a long-term cough: Three sheep (moon-era), one hundred dates, five liters of wine, soak for seven days and drink.</p>

<p><strong>Guidance:</strong><br>Movement: There are three types of this condition: either due to wind-cold causing coughing, or due to heart fire erratically moving and inflaming the lung passages. The method of returning to the origin and concentrating the spirit should be used to seal and secure; fire should not rise, the lung passages should not itch, and the coughing will naturally cease. For cold cough, especially practice a slight closing method. For fire cough, just stop and seal, seeking tranquility; then draw water from the kidneys to irrigate the lung fire, circulating it, and the lungs will receive moisture, causing the cough to naturally stop. Open the chest to clear the lung meridian, washing down through the lung meridian to the large intestine&#39;s nine curves, guiding it toward the valley path. </p>
<p>For cough caused by wind-cold and dampness, the external method involves making a fist and applying it at the shoulder’s edge, rubbing it down to the back and the kidney locations; self-warmth can dispel it. </p>
<p>Cough due to food accumulation requires an external method of rubbing the navel region, allowing food to gradually descend. It is necessary to be relaxed and have the diaphragm flat, allowing Qi to go down, which will lead to recovery. </p>
<p>For cough arising from deficient heat movements, one must swallow saliva, draw it down to the lower dantian, speak less, and avoid anger; this will lead to recovery. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Secret Instructions of the Stone Chamber&quot; states: The lungs, representing the metal element, are delicate organs that cannot contain foreign substances; however, they can still contain air. If a person has a persistent cough that does not improve despite taking various lung-nourishing medicines, unless air enters through the throat, the lungs will remain difficult to heal quickly. The method involves using the breath of a thirteen-year-old girl, who exhales her breath into the patient&#39;s mouth. Every day at the fifth watch (around 3-5 AM), the girl should mouth-feed the patient, fully sending her lower abdominal energy into the patient’s mouth. The patient should swallow a mouthful each day, limited to just one, which should be as effective as taking medicine. However, during the exhalation, one must strictly avoid any feelings of desire; any such motion will be not only useless but also harmful. The patient may only have one or two mouthfuls, in consideration of the girl’s health.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states: The method for guiding a cough involves sitting down with feet extended. Use the double child-rearing method, applying force to lift up, lower the head, and gradually bend down, using both hands to pull the toes three times. With strength, follow the original method to lift up, and then swallow saliva downwards into the lower abdomen.

It is damaged by dampness in autumn, leading to cough in winter. When winter&#39;s water is abundant, it combines with dampness, obstructing the heart, causing the fire not to descend but to rise, scorching the lung’s metal; after prolonged suffering, it results in a cough, and the metal cannot produce sound. Treating with tonics for the lungs and kidneys is not appropriate.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yang Shou&#39;s wife had been suffering from a cough for more than ten years, with persistent coughing for a day without relief. To stop it, musk soup was administered, yet even at midnight, the coughing persisted. After another dose, she felt somewhat nauseous the following morning, so ginseng soup was given, and after two days, she felt slightly better. After administering medicine on three occasions, the physician advised Luan Jingxian that a long-standing cough has already restrained the illness, and naturally, recovery would be slow. After several days of adjustment, the cough finally ceased. It is often said that after the cough eases, there are those who recover suddenly, and those who recover gradually. There are also cases of internal discomfort where the illness is not yet fully resolved, and cases of returning heat that must be treated without delay. Generally, after three days, a sense of relief is to be expected.</p>

He explained that a winter cough is caused by the dampness of the autumn, where damp earth reverses and causes coughing.

<p>A man, aged forty, suffered from a chronic cough, with phlegm that was thick and foul-smelling, unbearable to the nostrils. In autumn and winter, his condition was somewhat relieved, but worsened in spring and summer, characterized by alternating chills and fever, with symptoms manifesting in the afternoons, resembling those of malaria. He sweated excessively while sleeping, like water. He frequently took ephedra root and dried mulberry leaves, yet continued to sweat profusely. He also took calming and lung-soothing powders to no avail. Initially, the physician used a specific powder to induce vomiting, which brought forth phlegm resembling chicken fat, leading him to be unconscious for three days, occasionally given cool water to drink, gradually regaining consciousness and appetite. Afterward, he prescribed a mixture of ginseng and pinellia pills along with a sweet osmanthus remedy, and after a few doses, he was cured.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhao Xun&#39;s &quot;Notes on Nurturing Illness&quot; states: A young scholar from Zhao Prefecture suffered from a persistent cough, and none of the hundred medicines worked. Someone suggested using a bundle of soft mulberry branches facing south, cutting each branch into one-inch pieces to boil in a pot with five bowls of water until only one bowl remained. He was to drink this when thirsty, and after a month of this treatment, he recovered. This is also a modified method of boiling mulberry branches.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; mentions: A middle-aged woman with a dry cough had a pulse that was smooth and bean-like in shape, with the rest being scattered and large without being floating, and the left pulse was stronger than the right. Every morning at the fifth watch, she felt heat in her heart and sweat, but her anger was even worse, and there was no benefit from the herbs like platycodon. Thus, gypsum and cyperus were used as the main ingredients, along with gentian, coptis, indigo, asparagus, perilla fruit, dried tangerine peel, fried licorice, angelica, and platycodon as the assistants. In total, more than twenty prescriptions were given, and she began to feel better. A decoction of fresh ginger boiled with honey, and a decoction of dried tangerine peel were both effective for treating those without phlegm but still coughing, as the spicy-sweet ingredients moistened the lungs. If using only green tangerine peel, all the herbs should remove the white parts. </p>
<p>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states: Dried tangerine peel is spicy, regulates the qi, and removes phlegm and stagnation; green tangerine peel is bitter and regulates the lower qi. Both flavors work together to disperse the qi of the three jiao (body regions). Therefore, the &quot;Sacred Beneficial Treatise&quot; states: Dried tangerine peel removes obstructive elements; without removing obstruction, phlegm will form; ephedra induces sweating; if the obstruction is not removed, sweating will stop.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over fifty years old was suffering from a serious cold accompanied by a cough, with a hoarse voice. After taking a dose of Ginseng Decoction, his snoring gradually improved, and after two or three patches of treatment, the coughing also subsided. After taking two or three pounds of medicine, he was fully recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;The Essential Readings of Medicine&quot; states: The esteemed scholar Jin Bohan had a cough with difficulty in breathing. He had used nearly all remedies for clearing heat, moistening the lungs, transforming phlegm, and regulating the qi, but his illness showed no improvement. Upon examining his kidney pulse, it was large and soft, indicating a deficiency of qi with excessive fire. I prescribed three qian of ginseng decoction to accompany five qian of the Eight Flavors Pill, and after one dose, there was improvement. Later, I added one qian of cinnamon and eight fen of aconite to the Back to Qi Decoction. After a total of fifty doses and two pounds of the Eight Flavors Pill, he was cured.</p>
<p>The history scholar Ming Lin had been coughing for years and sought treatment from dozens of doctors, trying countless remedies, but his condition worsened. He believed he was bound to suffer from exhaustion. I said: &quot;Not so.&quot; His pulse was not rapid and weak but had a large, slippery quality on the right side, indicating unresolved wind-phlegm. He must have consumed too many sour astringents, which exacerbated his condition over time. I prescribed five doses of Ma Huang, Xing Ren, Ban Xia, Qian Hu, Jie Geng, Gan Cao, Ju Hong, and Su Zi, and after knowing the effects, he improved after ten doses.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhang Yuangong had a chronic cough for three years, and medication proved ineffective, so he resigned himself to his fate. One day, he visited me regarding another matter and expressed that he thought he could not be cured, but he requested a diagnosis. I asked him if he felt pain in his chest when hungry, and he said it was very painful. I noticed over ten white spots on his upper lip, which indicated that a worm was gnawing at his lungs. I prescribed a remedy made from hundred parts cream, along with black plum and betel nut. Within ten days, the pain subsided and the cough ceased. I instructed his family to search in a clean bucket, and they found more than forty small white worms. From then on, he never experienced a relapse.</p>
<p>Minister Feng Wuyue&#39;s daughter had been suffering from fever and cough for over six months. In October, she coughed up a significant amount of fresh blood. In one day, she could only consume a bowl of porridge, her large meat was consumed, her stools were watery, and she was bedridden, with a pulse rate of seven. I said: &quot;The method is not to save; this is well-known to everyone. If you can only heed my guidance and not be distracted by others, there is hope to save one out of ten.&quot; I prescribed three doses daily, each containing five qian of ginseng, three qian of astragalus, two qian of peony, and one qian of dried tangerine peel.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Medical Case Studies of Xue Ji&quot; states: A woman, unable to bear children, suffered from coughing, chest obstruction, and a lack of taste in her food. This indicated damage to both the spleen and lungs, with phlegm accumulating internally. The initial treatment was Gui Pi Decoction, supplemented with fresh gardenia fruit, Angelica, Fritillaria, and Platycodon, leading to gradual improvement of her symptoms.</p>
<p>A man experienced fatigue and coughed during winter. He took a dispersing remedy, thinking it beneficial. I said: This is due to weak lung qi and loose pores, making him susceptible to external pathogens. Immediate reinforcement of the spleen is essential for fundamental healing. He didn&#39;t believe me, took Six Gentlemen Decoction, removed ginseng and atractylodes, but added herbs like perilla and trifoliate orange, resulting in further depletion of his original qi, leading to lung abscess and his demise.</p>
<p>Doctor Li Beichuan, when overworked, would cough. I treated him with the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction, and he recovered. One day he relapsed and self-medicated with Ginseng and Perilla drink, worsening his condition; he then took Ginseng Dispersing Evils Powder, resulting in stiff neck, locked jaw, and tense back. I stated: He mistakenly lost sweat and body fluids, causing a transformation into a convulsion illness. Continuing with the previous decoction, I added a coin of aconite, and he recovered after four doses. If a cold leads to excessive sweating, difficulty in breathing, and continuous phlegm production, it may definitely result in abscess formation.</p>
<p>Master Tan Xizeng coughed and expectorated phlegm, with cold hands and feet. I diagnosed him with spleen and lung deficiency with cold, treated with Baizhong Yiqi, adding roasted ginger, and he was cured.&quot;<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Ruan, who was sent as an envoy, showed signs of coughing with a pale face and a runny nose; this indicated weakness in the spleen and lungs combined with an external pathogen. I treated him with a formula to tonify the middle and benefit the qi, adding Poria, Pinellia, and Schisandra, which led to recovery. I also later used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, along with Chuanxiong and Angelica, to ensure stability.</p>
<p>Director Chen Guohua had pre-existing yin deficiency and was suffering from a cough. He believed he understood medicine and used diaphoretic and phlegm-transforming medicines, which proved ineffective and worsened his condition. I stated that this was due to weakness in the spleen and lungs, but he did not believe me. Instead, he took Niu Huang Qing Xin Pill, resulting in further abdominal bloating, diminished appetite, and all signs of the three yin deficiencies became apparent. In the morning, he used Six Gentlemen Decoction, Platycodon, Cimicifuga, and the Five Flavors, to tonify the spleen and generate lung qi. In the evening, he took Eight Flavor Pill to reinforce the fire of the Mingmen, supporting the spleen. Over time, the various symptoms improved. The classic states: if one cannot treat the emptiness, how can one ask about the rest? The weakness of the spleen does not allow it to generate lung qi, and using previous medicines only exacerbates the fire; I could not understand that.</p>
<p>Zhongshu Bao Xifu, who also suffered from yin deficiency and a cough, took Qing Qi Hua Tan Pill, along with Er Chen, Scutellaria, and Coptis types, and his phlegm increased. He then used Si Wu, Coptis, Anemarrhena, and Scrophularia; he experienced abdominal bloating and hoarseness, with a floating and wiry pulse on the right and a vigorous pulse on the left. I suggested that since the spleen cannot generate lung qi and the yin fire is counteracting it, it should nourish the source of digestion. In the morning, he took a combination to tonify the middle, adding Cornus, Ophiopogon, and the Five Flavors, and in the evening, he took Six Flavor Rehmannia with Schisandra. After more than three months, he was delighted to find his condition had improved significantly.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Regarding the patient Shi Zhan, every spring he would cough. I prescribed a decoction of Ginseng and Suye, adding Scutellaria, Lian, Sang, and Xing, and he recovered. In the spring of the Year of Yisi, his condition worsened; he developed a hoarse voice and a weak pulse on the left wrist. I concluded this was related to the kidney meridian&#39;s yin fire, affecting the lung&#39;s metal; thus, I aimed to nourish the source of transformation. I prescribed Liuwei Dihuang Wan, supplemented with Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, and fried Gardenia, along with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Zhang Keming experienced coughing, treated with Er Chen, Scutellaria, Lian, Zhiqiao; he felt fullness in the chest, wheezing, and coughed up phlegm early in the morning. I added Suzi and Xingren, which led to the discharge of phlegm and a sensation of dryness and thirst. I diagnosed his early morning phlegm as due to spleen weakness leading to an inability to digest; the chest fullness was also due to spleen weakness failing to nourish the lung&#39;s metal; the excessive saliva was from spleen weakness failing to contain it; the thirst and dryness resulted from the spleen&#39;s inability to generate fluids. I then used Liu Jun Zi Tang with fried ginger and dried fruit to warmly nourish the spleen and stomach, and also incorporated Ba Wei Wan to replenish the earth element, resulting in his recovery.</p>
<p>One man experienced phlegm and coughing in summer, which did not respond to medicines for stomach fire. I diagnosed this as the fire invading the lung&#39;s metal and treated him with Mai Men Dong Tang, leading to recovery. Later, after overexertion, he coughed again; I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding Jie Geng, Shan Zhi, Pian Qin, Mai Men, and Wu Wei to assist in his recovery. However, he exhibited dryness of the mouth and fatigue, with dark and scanty urination. I employed Sheng Mai San daily to help him recover. If the cough was due to stomach fire with phlegm, I recommended Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang. For stomach qi deficiency, I suggested Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Beimu and Jie Geng. If yin fire was surging upwards, I would use Sheng Mai San with Di Huang Wan to protect the lung qi and nourish kidney water. This is a true organ issue, not simply a matter of nourishing the source of transformation, and cannot be resolved by simple methods.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered from a cough, side pain, and fever, which worsened in the afternoons. She was treated with a modified Xiao Yao San plus熟地 and recovered. After a year, due to anger and labor, her previous symptoms returned, accompanied by sun headaches and alternating cold and heat, as well as coughing and frequent urination. These were attributed to liver fire and blood deficiency. Using the previous formula along with Di Huang Wan for over a month, she recovered.</p>
<p>A cousin&#39;s wife experienced a cough with fever, vomiting phlegm, producing about five or six bowls of sputum day and night, with wheezing and constant coughing, chest constriction, thirst, and loss of appetite, culminating in a severe menstrual flow. This indicated a deficiency of the kidney&#39;s fire and coldness of the spleen, so she was treated with Ba Wei Wan and Fu Zi Li Zhong Tang with modifications, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman had a cough, with excessive phlegm in the morning and severe wheezing at night preventing sleep. I noted that the morning phlegm was due to a deficiency in the spleen that led to phlegm formation from food, while the nightly wheezing was due to pulmonary deficiency and excess yin fire. Hence, I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>Chen Dao Fu&#39;s eldest son suffered from deficiency in the kidney essence and had a chronic cough that worsened in the afternoons. I suggested that he should tonify the spleen, nourish the source of digestion, enabling the metal (lung) and water (kidney) to mutually support each other. During early spring, he was skeptical and instead took Huang Lian and Zhi Mu. By summer, he was coughing up phlegm, felt thirsty, urinated frequently, and had a flushed face. I prescribed a formula of Bai Zhu, Dang Gui, Fu Ling, Chen Pi, Mai Dong, Wu Wei, Dan Pi, and Ze Xie in four doses, which I then combined with Ren Shen, Huang Qi, 熟地, and Shan Yao into pills for him to take. All symptoms quickly subsided. Upon further consultation, I sensed his belief had strengthened, so I continued the previous medication as usual. However, he remained unwilling to take it, ultimately leading to his decline.<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states: A woman suffered from prolonged coughing due to lung heat, her body felt as if it were burned, and her muscles were thin, approaching exhaustion. Using equal parts of loquat leaves, akebia, winter flower, purple aster, apricot kernels, and mulberry white skin, with half the amount of rhubarb powdered finely, forming pills the size of cherries to be taken before bed during winter, she was cured before finishing one dose.</p>
<p>The &quot;Meaning of Herbs&quot; states: A patient presented with cough due to a cold, without any fever, felt extremely anxious as if near death, struggling to breathe. Upon examination, I found his head and face red, restless and unable to calm, and his pulse was large and empty. I remarked that this case was quite unusual, resembling a cold with excess heat; why would a cold also present symptoms this way? It was essential to use ginseng, aconite, and other warming herbs to support the lower source and recover the vital energy. Otherwise, he would profusely sweat at the shi and chou hours and could die from loss of yang. He did not heed my words. As night fell, without needing to exert himself, he grew even more frantic, which led him to urgently take the previous medicine. After taking it, he felt somewhat calmer for a while. I then suggested having someone sleep beside him to help bring out his sweat like rain. After using one more dose, his sweating stopped, and his body felt stable; he no longer coughed. When I inquired about what had happened, he mentioned having taken four doses of ephedra, which made him restless and feel like dying. Thus, I realized that even a cold could present an excess heat pattern, just like in cases of true cold. This was mainly due to his underlying deficiency, which made the true yang more prone to overflowing.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I was also informed that my lung abscess was becoming serious, and due to my old age, I could not bear it. Therefore, I used a decoction of Qingli and jujube to clear the lung. First, I opened the obstruction of the lung&#39;s qi, and then I felt some relief in my breathing, was able to eat a little, and could expel phlegm more easily. My body could also tilt slightly, indicating a significant chance of recovery. But I said: Not yet. I see that the situation is coming on too urgently, and if I am forced to seek immediate relief, ultimately, a temporary opening can easily lead to a reclosure. When it closes again, the previous method cannot be used again. Now, while it is temporarily open, I will explore multiple methods to remedy it, ensuring recovery by the winter solstice in sixty days. The dryness within the body and the dryness of the season are intertwined and difficult to resolve. We must wait for the dry metal to withdraw its qi, allowing the lung metal to attain tranquility. I urge diligent treatment for the condition during this period of sixty days, as there will be frequent crises and recoveries. Generally, all methods used should be active adjustments because supplementing is not appropriate for lung diseases.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a></p></div>
