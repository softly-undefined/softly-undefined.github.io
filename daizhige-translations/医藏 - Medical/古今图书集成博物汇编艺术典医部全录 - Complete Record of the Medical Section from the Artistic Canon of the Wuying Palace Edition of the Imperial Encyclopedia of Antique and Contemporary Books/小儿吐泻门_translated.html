      <div><p><strong>Collection of Medical Texts from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 434: Pediatric Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directives for Pediatric Patients</strong> (Song Dynasty, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Concurrent Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>After May 25, vomiting and diarrhea with strong heat indicates nine parts heat in the internal organs. If heat injures milk and food, resulting in vomiting that does not relieve, and diarrhea that is deep yellow in color, Yulu San should be used. </p>
<p>After June 15, vomiting and diarrhea with warm body indicates six parts cold in the internal organs. If there is vomiting of undigested milk and food, diarrhea that is yellow-white, and dryness and thirst, take a small dose of Yihuang San before meals and a larger dose of Yulu San after meals. </p>
<p>After July 7, vomiting and diarrhea with cool body indicates three parts heat and seven parts cold. If not breastfeeding due to excessive sleeping, experiencing agitation and choking, with breathlessness, sleeping with eyes open, and pale lips with frequent belching, both Yihuang and Yulu San should be used.</p>
<p>After August 15, vomiting and diarrhea with cool body, not breastfeeding, dry belching, and diarrhea of dark greenish-brown water indicates lack of yang, and Yihuang San should be used. For persistent diarrhea with undigested milk and food, resulting in muscle atrophy, this indicates spleen and stomach deficiency and coldness, and should use Muxiang Wan. It should not be taken in summer; if there are cold symptoms, take it in small doses.</p>
<p>If the body is warm with strong heat, or diarrhea is red, yellow, or black, this indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, and Huanglian Wan should be used. It should not be taken in winter; if there are heat symptoms, take it in small doses.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Note: According to previous methods as per the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; if there is cold, use distant cold; if heat, use distant heat. It is also said that if there is stagnation, treat it in opposition, even if it contradicts the timing but aligns with the symptoms. The stomach injury will cause vomiting, the spleen injury will lead to diarrhea, and if both the spleen and stomach are injured, vomiting and diarrhea will occur together. For symptoms of damage from pungent heat, with stagnation causing vomiting or severe diarrhea, use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Huanglian, Wuzhuyu, and Muxiang. If the stagnation has resolved but diarrhea persists, use Four Gentlemen Decoction plus Muxiang and Guozhi. If caused by injury from consuming cold, resulting in abdominal pain and greenish-white diarrhea, use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Sharen, Muxiang, and Paojiang. If the injury is due to fish or meat, use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Hawthorn and Sharen. If the diarrhea is red, yellow, or of any dark color, indicating general heat in the organs, first use Xianglian Pill, then follow with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to aid the Xianglian Pill. If experiencing greenish-white diarrhea, or if milk and food are undigested, use Ren Shen Li Zhong Pill. If there is vomiting and significant drowsiness with open eyes, use Wuwei Yigong Powder. If drowsiness without open eyes, use Yulu Powder. If there is vomiting with both hands and feet being hot, or if there is a preference for cold food and drink, or if drowsiness without open eyes, use Xie Huang Powder. If hands and feet are cold, if there is aversion to cold food and drink, or if there is drowsiness with open eyes, use Six Gentlemen Decoction and Muxiang.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The two pills, Mu Xiang and Huang Lian, while capable of dispelling disease and counteracting evil, are not without damage to the spleen and stomach; practitioners should examine accordingly! If one experiences vomiting with a yellow or watery diarrhea, it indicates damage from heat in the milk; if vomiting with a blue or green diarrhea, it indicates damage from cold in the milk; both should be treated with purgatives. Vomiting or diarrhea accompanied by lethargy and an inability to be refreshed by sleep indicates excess heat in the stomach. If there&#39;s sputum and green water, it suggests a cold weakness in the stomach.</p>
<p>Note: In cases where a child is startled or when a nursing mother is angry, leading to blue vomiting or diarrhea, it is advisable to use Yi Gong San with Chai Hu. If the mother consumes rich foods causing heat in the milk, use Dong Yuan Qing Wei San. If the mother has drunk alcohol causing heat in the milk, administer Ge Hua Jie Cheng Tang, one or two spoonfuls for the child. If consuming strong liquor causes heat in the milk, or if the mother and child develop redness or cloudiness, taking three to five cups of cold rice vinegar is also beneficial; the child may take one or two spoonfuls. If the mother has stagnation causing cold milk, she should take Yang Wei Tang, while the child should take Tiao Zhong Wan. If the mother has stagnation that heats the milk, she should take Da An Wan, and the child should take Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If the mother is emotionally upset, harming her liver and spleen, leading to hot milk, use Gui Pi Tang or Xiao Yao San. If the mother has a weak spleen and low blood causing heat in the milk, use Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding Chuan Xiong and Gui.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If the mother has deficiency of qi and blood along with heat in the milk, both the mother and child should take the Eight Treasures Powder. If the mother has fever due to overwork and there is heat in the milk, both should take the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction. If the heat in the milk is due to the mother&#39;s anger affecting the liver, use the Five-Flavored Different Effects Powder with added Chai Hu and Shan Zhi. If there is vomiting of phlegm or white-green fluid, it indicates a condition where the liver wood overcomes the spleen earth due to deficiency and cold; use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Chai Hu and Mu Xiang. Generally, if there is vomiting of milk and diarrhea with a bluish color, it pertains to fright, and treatment should focus on calming the liver and tonifying the spleen; if the vomiting and diarrhea are bluish-white, it relates to cold, and treatment should involve warm tonification of the spleen earth. If the previous conditions are accompanied by hot hands and feet, it indicates excess; if cold hands and feet, it indicates deficiency, which is also a method of diagnosis.</p>
<p>Within the first ten days after birth, if there is vomiting, diarrhea, and strong heat, and either no milk or milk that cannot be digested, or if it is white, first use the White Biscuit Powder to purge, then follow with the Yi Huang Powder to harmonize. </p>
<p>For newborns experiencing vomiting due to foulness swallowed, use the Water Melon Powder to address it. In general, for newborns, it is essential to promptly clean the mouth; otherwise, as soon as they cry, they may accidentally swallow waste, leading to various illnesses.</p>
<p>(Note: According to the notes, many issues in newborns arise from the wet nurse&#39;s lack of caution with emotions and indulgence in rich flavors, transferring illness to the child. One should carefully assess the cause to treat the mother. The medications previously mentioned may be too harsh for the delicate organs and must be used judiciously.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Hejian Six Classics</strong> (by Liu Wanshu)</p>
<p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>All five organs indicate heat syndromes, without signs of cold. However, some say that diarrhea with clear, pale, and non-turbid urine indicates cold. When food and drink do not digest but the color remains unchanged, resulting in foul-smelling vomit and diarrhea that is clear and cool, with pale and non-turbid appearance, and the body feeling cool without thirst, a weak and fine pulse indicates a cold syndrome. Although food does not digest, if the color changes and there is restlessness, thirst, and yellowish-red, turbid urine, it indicates a heat syndrome. It is commonly believed that children suffering from vomiting and diarrhea from cholera, with undigested milk resulting in white diarrhea, is mistakenly considered a cold syndrome. Zhang Zhongjing said: &quot;Heat evil does not digest food.&quot; How could it be cold!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Filial Piety in the Confucian School</strong> (by Zhang Congzheng)</p>
<p><strong>Body Heat, Vomiting, and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In the case of children with body heat, vomiting, and diarrhea, with abdominal fullness and inability to take in food and drink, one can urgently administer Niu Huang Tong Ge Wan. If the condition persists beyond four or five doses, recovery should ensue. This is because dairy foods belong to the category of water, and if severe, it results in dampness. Treating damp with drying and heating medicines is inappropriate. In cases of persistent watery diarrhea in children, one may use Wuling San and Yiyuan San each, with a dose of three to two qian mixed in fresh water, administered frequently without regard to time. If symptoms worsen rapidly, it pertains to fire, treat with cooling methods such as Qingge and Tongsheng, and those who use them should not take them lightly. This is not easy to explain without deep understanding of nature.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences sudden and persistent diarrhea, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that this is called acute diarrhea. If it persists and does not improve, it is due to excessive fire in the body. The nature of fire is abrupt and rapid. It is urgent to use freshly drawn water to prepare drinks such as Ganlu (sweet dew) and Wuling powder, or Tian Shui powder. Alternatively, one can decoct these medicines in well water, let it cool, and have the patient take it, which will lead to recovery. One should avoid cold rice husk, dried ginger, and strong purgative herbs; even if the diarrhea is stopped, it may cause stagnation in the intestines and stomach, leading to abdominal distension. The treatment must differentiate between yin and yang and promote the water pathways, which is the essence of effective treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>If a child suffers from prolonged diarrhea that persists until eight or nine months, it may develop into cold dysentery in autumn, characterized by cyanotic and white diarrhea, frequent pain, and undigested milk. One can use Yangpi pills about the size of millet, taking two to thirty pills each time, washed down with rice drink, three times a day until recovery. Yihuang powder may also be used. </p>
<p>In general, when treating children, one must avoid extreme cold or extreme hot medications, as well as harsh tonics and purgatives, or mistakenly using physic such as croton seeds, apricot kernels, sulfur, or greasy powders. Using these may cause additional illnesses. As children are prone to weakness and strong reactions, their intestines and stomach are tender and cannot withstand toxicity. When treating them, it is imperative to use methods that differentiate between yin and yang and promote water pathways, with preparations like Guiling Ganlu powder being particularly urgent.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of vomiting: silent vomiting, which is devoid of material; noisy vomiting, which has no material; and vomiting with both sound and material. The conditions are categorized into three: cold, heat, and food accumulation. </p>
<p>For cold vomiting, the expulsion is small while the quantity is large; this indicates that the stomach is affected by cold. One may use Wei Ling Wan or ginger decoction to swallow, or treat with Li Zhong Wan. In cases of cold vomiting, food does not congeal, and there is no aversion to food. </p>
<p>For heat vomiting, one expels a large quantity with little material; this indicates that the stomach is hot. Treat with Er Chen Tang combined with Huang Lian and cooked ginger. In heat vomiting, food is digested, and there is no aversion to food. </p>
<p>For food accumulation vomiting, it is essential to identify the three burners clearly, as all can consume food. If one vomits immediately upon eating, the accumulation is in the upper burner (stomach), and one should swallow with light salt water and afterward use a goose feather to clean the mouth to expel any residual accumulation, treating with Er Chen Tang combined with cooked ginger, Shen Qu, stir-fried malt, and stir-fried almonds. </p>
<p>If vomiting occurs one to two hours after eating, the accumulation is in the middle burner (gastric outlet near the small intestine). First use Ding Xiang Pi Ji Wan to clear the old accumulation, then treat with Er Chen Tang combined with digestive medicines.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If one experiences early morning vomiting after breakfast or vomiting after an evening meal, it indicates that the food is stuck in the lower jiao, below the small intestine and above the large intestine. First, administer the Dingxiang Pine Accumulation Pill to alleviate this issue, then use the Erchen Decoction combined with digestive herbs to treat it. Digestive herbs such as Shenyu, Malt, Sand Ginger, and Xiangfu should be included. If vomiting persists and none of the medicines are being absorbed, this indicates a condition of concealed stomach fire obstructing the entrance; in this case, use the Lizhong Decoction combined with children&#39;s urine and pig bile, stir-fry and prepare it for consumption, which will stop the issue effectively—its efficacy is remarkable and inexpressible. </p>
<p>If one vomits up roundworms, use the Lizhong Decoction with one black plum, a little piece of Aconite, and Huangbo and Chuan Jiao to stop it. If one becomes weak after vomiting, simply adjust with the Jisheng Pill. If various vomits are unable to absorb medicine, it indicates a deficiency of Yang due to excess Yin; adding children’s urine and pig bile is essential, as children’s urine is sour and salty with a cold nature, while bile is bitter and cold, which harmonizes with the Lizhong Decoction. This way, Yin gradually disperses and Yang can emerge; this aligns with what the Inner Canon states about addressing the root cause before the symptoms—this knowledge is not for my descendants to reveal.</p>
<p>In cases of persistent vomiting with eyes looking upwards and head leaning back, do not treat. The ancestral method for treating vomiting simply employs the Weiling Pill, taken with ginger decoction, effective regardless of hot or cold. If vomiting continues, taking medication yields no effect, and the patient becomes increasingly agitated, do not treat further.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Vomiting and refusal of food make it hard for medicine to take effect. This is due to excessive yin blocking the solitary yang, making it the time for medical troubles. Ginseng and astragalus cooked with ginger and served hot, and black plum with child’s urine are especially good. Adding pig bile in a careful manner, this method should respond like a shadow.</p>
<p>First, expel the roundworm; this is due to roundworm causing excessive yin. The black plum pill works like a miracle; a single dose will stabilize the stomach and stop vomiting. For those who cough and then vomit, transforming phlegm and smoothing qi is essential. If regularly experiencing vomiting, use ginger in the soup as a guide.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea is generally related to dampness, with five types of symptoms. The main treatment method focuses on promoting elimination and lifting, and one should not apply the same treatment indiscriminately. For symptoms of diarrhea with a pale blue color, or undigested dairy and food, accompanied by abdominal pain and cold limbs, with a pale face and no thirst, this is cold dampness. Symptoms often arise in winter, and one should use Wuling Powder as a guide, swallowing the Lizhong Pill to stop the condition. If the cold is severe and does not stop, Li Zhong Decoction with a slice of Fuzi will be effective.</p>
<p>For diarrhea characterized by yellow and thick stools, abdominal pain with heat, a red face, and thirst, this is heat dampness. Symptoms usually occur in summer, and one should treat it with Wuling Powder supplemented with Talcum, Licorice, and Mutong; in severe cases, Yulu San or Li Zhong Decoction will be effective.</p>
<p>For persistent diarrhea resulting in yellow watery stools, with or without thirst, this is wind dampness. Symptoms commonly occur in summer, and one should treat it with Wuling Powder combined with Fangfeng, Cangzhu, and Qianghuo.</p>
<p>For chronic diarrhea with slippery intestines that does not stop, this indicates dampness harming the original qi leading to sinking. It is advisable to use herbs that promote lifting. Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Shengma, Fangfeng, and Wumei is recommended, or one can use Four Gentlemen Decoction and swallow Qiwemeiren Doukou Pill to achieve the desired effect.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>If there is diarrhea accompanied by a sour smell, abdominal pain, a yellow complexion with heat, and a lack of appetite, this indicates food accumulation. First, use Clove Spleen Accumulation Pill to dispel the accumulation, and then adjust with Gather the Saints Pill. </p>
<p>If diarrhea lasts long and there is unquenchable thirst, just take a decoction of Atractylodes more frequently, and there will be no failure. </p>
<p>If diarrhea persists, the eyes lack spirit, the mouth is slightly open, the limbs feel cold, and there is a desire to sleep, use Four Gentlemen Decoction for adjustment in a larger quantity for effectiveness; for severe cases, add a small piece of cooked Aconite and take with dried ginger. </p>
<p>If diarrhea lasts long with persistent body heat, treat it with Tonic Decoction; as this is due to empty heat, cold or cooling medicines must not be carelessly used, and for severe cases, adding dried ginger will be effective. </p>
<p>For those who appear weak and yellow after diarrhea, just use Gather the Saints Powder. </p>
<p>Traditionally, diarrhea was treated without concern for cold or heat, merely using Stomach Tonic Pills along with one grain of Golden Pill, treating it with a decoction of prepared millet with plantain seeds. </p>
<p>For prolonged diarrhea with good spirit, a red face, and red lips, do not treat; if it turns into dysentery, do not treat; if the pulse is deep and thin, the body feels cold, there is lack of appetite, and thirst is unending, do not treat; if there are convulsions, do not treat; if the stools are as large as bamboo tubes and do not close, do not treat; if there is continuous slippery diarrhea, do not treat; if there is significant weight loss, do not treat. </p>
<p>In general, when treating diarrhea, regardless of severity, as long as dairy and food are consumed as usual and no other symptoms arise, recovery is easy. </p>
<p>Clear River Melody.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Diarrhea caused by the five deficiencies is truly unpredictable; the six pulses want to end, the intestines are slippery and the soul&#39;s gate is open, the spleen is cold and the body is thin, unable to swallow food. [Also weak in spirit.] A physician who can cure this illness is indeed skilled. Ginseng, astragalus, and poria, along with tang-kuei, stone calamus, and the skin of the he-hsieh, mixed with various grains. If you still see no effect, it&#39;s alright; oysters can be used for reinforcement. If taking medicine yields no effect at all, the golden liquid elixir is marvelous. Aconite and sulfur, with methods passed down through generations. Bringing the dead back to life, just a little relief can be quite healing.<br>Western River Moon<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>In summer months, many suffer from diarrhea, accompanied by abdominal pain and thirst. Use pigweed, dodder, and poria together, with licorice and dry ginger applied generously. Atractylodes, coptis, and talc are effective, as well as ginseng, sand ginger to warm the center. Ventilate the qi using pulsatilla, adding black plum decoction for extra benefit.</p>
<p>In summer, excessive rain harms dampness; benefiting urination is paramount. Combine pigweed, dodder, and coptis, along with gardenia and bupleurum for relief. Use notopterygium, green tangerine peel, and bitter orange, pairing with poria and red herbs. Stew papaya with white atractylodes, and a bit of yellow herbal for efficacy.</p>
<p>The secret methods for treating diarrhea are rarely discussed among common people. Now, teaching these to my children and grandchildren surpasses owning vast fields of good land. Initially, apply gentle diuresis, progressively warming the center for effect. Three doses may stop diarrhea in infants; this method is established through the ages.</p>
<p>Why does diarrhea occur? Simply because water and grain are not properly absorbed. Thus, gentle diuresis is imperative, and prolonged urination leads to control. Use talc, plantago, red poria, with ginseng, white atractylodes, and pigweed. Licorice, dodder, and cardamom should be added. Ginger and dates can serve as guides in decoction.</p>
<p>Should gentle diuresis fail, and the energy sinks, it requires raising. Use ginseng, white atractylodes, and astragalus, alongside licorice and dry ginger for clinical efficacy.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Achyranthes, Polygala, and red Poria; Angelica, roasted Aconite, and black plum. Bupleurum, white peony, and Dong Quai, ginger and jujube, for children, do not discard. </p>
<p>The elevation is rising but not stopping; at this time, the intestines are slippery and hard to manage. If the blockage is due to communication, what worries remain? Strike against inertia, and recovery is possible. Ginseng, Atractylodes, roasted ginger, and roasted licorice, black plum and sorghum support each other. Angelica, chebula, peony, and Dong Quai seek together; ginger and jujube, boiled and taken warm.</p>
<p>The methods exhaust leakage but still remain, during which good is scarce and misfortune plenty. Even if the parents had no other choice, you must not let the physician make mistakes. Ginseng, Atractylodes, Poria, ginger, and licorice, cardamom and nutmeg, chebula. Dried toad, aloe, and woody incense combined; red stone vinegar pills adjusted can do.</p>
<p>Diarrhea often causes thirst; white Atractylodes dispersed like immortals. Ginseng, white Atractylodes, and woody incense combined, dried ginger and patchouli leaf. Licorice, Poria, and the seven flavors, add black plum and boil together. At this time, also bring the Fulong liver; this method is worth a thousand gold.</p>
<p>For diarrhea, treat as usual, no need for trickery. Just use the pill medicine to treat the stomach and Poria, after three doses it will stop naturally. If this is ineffective, continue using previous methods for support. I will teach the heart method for people to know; it clearly shows the physician across three generations.</p>
<p>In the months of May and June, diarrhea is frequent, with less cold and more heat. The Li Zhong pill saves from deep illness; the Jade Dew powder can be adjusted and taken. If ineffective, four Poria serves as a guide, taking the Li Zhong mixture for harmony. Naturally, the leakage stops without delay; more lives saved leads many to remember me.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of symptoms for vomiting and diarrhea: cold, heat, and accumulation. The treatment methods are somewhat similar to those for diarrhea; those observing should examine them closely. </p>
<p>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea with flushed cheeks, warm legs and feet, a preference for drinking water, and a hot body, this indicates a heat condition. The treatment method is to use Weiling Pills or a single Jin Dan, administered with Cheqian Grass and Dengxin Decoction.</p>
<p>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea with a pale face, cold legs and feet, and lack of thirst, and if there is any heat present, this indicates a cold condition. The treatment is to start with Lizhong Decoction to stop the symptoms, and if they don’t stop, then use Yihuang Powder, or treat with Weiling Pills or Rou Dou Kou Pills.</p>
<p>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea where there is aversion to food or inability to breastfeed, accompanied by abdominal pain, and the vomit and diarrhea are all sour and foul, this indicates food accumulation. First, remove the food accumulation using the Ganying Pills, then regulate with Weiling Pills, or alternatively, Food Spleen Accumulation Pills may also be effective.</p>
<p>In cases of prolonged vomiting and diarrhea where one gradually becomes thinner and weaker, experiences thirst and heat, and if not treated for a long time, it will certainly worsen. For this, use a modified Buzhong Decoction for treatment.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Generally, when men and women suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, the balance of yin and yang should be clear. If a man experiences severe diarrhea without the presence of yin, and a woman vomits excessively without reason, this indicates a conflict caused by cold food. If there is an abundance of material but a scarcity of frequency, this suggests a prevalence of heat that must be carefully recognized. </p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea appear simultaneously, this is termed chaotic yang and yin. A single application of the rational remedy will resolve both vomiting and diarrhea. If taking medicine still proves ineffective, add gently processed ginger. Using black plum as an assistant is excellent advice, but do not boast about it to ordinary people.</p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea cause persistent thirst, various soups and medicines yield no effect. If drinking soup or water leads to abdominal swelling, one may be resigned to fate, awaiting death. Quickly drink Poria remedy and often mediate for the child. When vomiting ceases, and the fire is soothed, then confirm with the rational remedy.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Hundred Questions of Infants&quot; by Lu Bosi from the Ming Dynasty:</p>
<p>Zhong Yang states: When a newborn is cleaned, if the mouth is not thoroughly cleared of filth, it is swallowed into the throat, resulting in vomiting and various illnesses. &quot;Vomiting&quot; involves a sound, while &quot;to throw up&quot; refers to expelling milk. In general, infants should not be overfed; if full, they will overflow, leading to vomiting. The stomach takes in milk like a vessel filled with things; a small cup cannot hold the volume of a large bowl. When rain falls heavily, a pond overflows; when wine is violently stirred, a cup flips over. This is a matter of logic. </p>
<p>Wet nurses, lacking knowledge, merely focus on quickly getting the child to grow without considering timing; they may continue to feed the child while it sleeps. How can there be satisfaction? The source of illness gradually develops from this.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>If the stomach qi is deficient, and this leads to a slow reaction, should one not be cautious? In this case, it’s best to control the milk supply, and if it’s severe, to cease breastfeeding altogether. Initially, the wet nurse can take tonics to regulate the qi, while the child should take digestion pills to transform milk and strengthen the stomach. It is stated that issues such as vomiting milk may arise under various conditions, with both cold and heat manifestations, and one must discern the differences. If the milk comes out from the corners of the mouth, it indicates an excess of milk that the child cannot digest, leading to overflow; this is not a disease. Regular use of milk-dissolving pills or various tonics is advisable, and it is crucial for the wet nurse to moderate her milk supply. For cold-induced vomiting, remedies such as Qinyin Decoction, Xiangfu Powder, and Kuai Pi should be administered. If the vomiting is due to heat, the forehead will feel warm, with yellow saliva and thirst, and the urine will be scant and red. This is indicative of heat-induced vomiting, often seen after overheating. The wet nurse should also take Xiangru Powder and Wuling Powder. Additionally, for phlegm-induced vomiting due to unresolved wind, if the child vomits milk with phlegm, and this persists over time, it may lead to wind conditions; thus, one should consider laxative and phlegm-dissolving medicines, such as Zhu Ru Decoction without cinnamon, Wuling Powder, Qingzhou White Pills, and Warm Gallbladder Decoction. Careful adjustment and treatment should be prioritized, and Zishuang Pill may also be taken.</p>
<p>Heat-induced vomiting </p>
<p>During autumn and summer, children often experience heat-induced vomiting. How can one distinguish this? Symptoms may include yellow saliva, a warm forehead, heat in the five palms, scant and red urine, or dry lips accompanied by restlessness and thirst. The wet nurse should first take Xiangru Powder and Wuling Powder, while the child takes Zhu Ru Decoction and Wuling Powder. In cases of severe heat, a modified Chai Hu Decoction without Da Huang can be used, or Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may also be effective. For extreme heat, Da Cheng Qi Decoction may be administered, and its effects are remarkable; Yu Lu Powder can also be taken.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Cold Vomiting and Reversal</strong></p>
<p>If a child is affected by wind and cold, or consumes too much raw or cold fruits, the stomach may become cold, resulting in vomiting food or milk. This can be treated with the Rilizhong Decoction; other remedies include the Milk Fermentation Method, Digestive Tablets, Yigong Powder, Xiangpu Powder, Fuling Banxia Decoction, Erchen Decoction, Ren Shen Powder, and Shechen Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Cholera with Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>For children who experience vomiting and diarrhea, some may have a warm body, while others may feel hot or cool. There are those whose vomiting and diarrhea cause convulsions, those that suffer from summer heat, and those who vomit or have diarrhea within three days of birth. It is said: If a child under three days old has vomiting and diarrhea with strong heat, lacks desire for milk or food, has blue-white stools, and cannot digest milk or food, it indicates a cold damage, and should be purged immediately; afterward, warm the stomach with white biscuits. To warm the stomach, use Yihuang Powder as the primary treatment. </p>
<p>From three to ten days later, if vomiting and diarrhea occur with a warm or cool body, lacking desire for milk or food, and blue-white stools with undigested milk or food, this indicates excess above and deficiency below; treat it with adjusted Yihuang Powder. Additionally, if there is a wind-damage with vomiting and diarrhea, presenting warm at times and cool at others, with much qi, and yellow-white stools, along with vomiting undigested milk or food, persistent coughing, and signs affecting the five organs, medicinally, one should use the Junchen medicine, starting with Daqing Ointment and then Yihuang Powder as the primary treatment.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If there is vomiting and diarrhea, high body temperature, excessive sleep, the ability to eat milk, persistent thirst, vomiting phlegm, and yellow watery stools, this indicates stomach deficiency with heat, thirst, and vomiting. One should generate fluids in the stomach to quench the thirst, and after that, use diaphoretic medicines. To quench thirst, frequently take Bai Zhu San; to disperse, use Da Qing Gao and Diao Teng Yin. </p>
<p>If there is vomiting and diarrhea, coolness of the body, foaming at the mouth, pale watery stools, discomfort without thirst, and shortness of breath, this is caused by a slight injury from wind leading to vomiting and diarrhea. One should tonify the spleen and then disperse. To tonify the spleen, use Yi Huang San; for dispersal, Da Qing Gao and Diao Teng Yin.</p>
<p>After the summer solstice, if there is vomiting and diarrhea with strong body heat, this indicates heat syndrome, possibly caused by excessive heat from food, leading to undigested milk causing vomiting and deep yellow diarrhea. Yu Lu San is the main remedy, and Wu Ling San is also good, with options like Xiang Ru San and Che Qian Zi San as alternatives.</p>
<p>If the complexion is greenish-yellow, it indicates wind-heat in the spleen, fear of people, and inability to close the eyes, suggesting there is toxic phlegm in the heart leading to stomach inversion. One can take Ding Ming Dan.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Cold Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Tang said: This is due to spleen deficiency caused by cold, leading to the inability to digest food, resulting in diarrhea. Zhong Yang said: When a child cannot digest milk, has brown watery stools, and feels cold with no warmth, one should treat the spleen. Yi Huang San is the main prescription for this. There are differences between ancient and modern approaches, so adjustments should be made according to specific conditions for safety. For cold accumulation diarrhea, the Yan Shi Zi Wan is very effective. Ren Shen San and Li Zhong Tang with modifications are particularly beneficial; adding nutmeg will help stop the symptoms. Lai Fu Dan and Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San are also suitable. Guan Yin San and Yin Bai San with adjustments can be used as balanced remedies.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Heat Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Tang&#39;s School states: In cases of heat diarrhea in children, the stools are yellow and red, sometimes with foam, indicating accumulation in the intestines. This may be due to the wet nurse enjoying alcohol, indulging in hot foods, or sitting down causing excess heat. If the physician does not understand this, but merely prescribes cardamom, myrobalan, and other medicines, it is like pouring water on stone; lacking in diagnosis, they cannot differentiate between heat and cold, and using the wrong medication results in no effect. This condition should be verified with signs such as scanty red urine and dry mouth with agitation. The treatment principle should involve using Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu powder, excluding wood incense. Wu Ling powder, excluding cassia, can also be taken. For severe heat, Si Ni San or Da Chai Hu Decoction, excluding rhubarb, would be particularly effective. Additionally, Huang Lian Wan and similar formulas are also beneficial. The Tuning Middle Decoction, excluding rhubarb and adding Huang Lian and Zhi Ke, can be used. If there is concurrent heat and diarrhea, with a combination of Tai Yang and Shao Yang diseases and bowel movements, Huang Qin Decoction may be appropriate, adding Ban Xia in cases of vomiting. Furthermore, for cases of heat diarrhea with severe red and scanty urine, Si Shun Qing Liang Drink should be the main remedy.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Food-Related Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Tang said: For this type of diarrhea, one should not supplement immediately. First, use digestive medicines or Zishuang Pills to eliminate any food accumulation before considering supplementation. The classics say: For food-related diarrhea, it&#39;s important to extract what is heavy, while for weakness from malnutrition, one should utilize tonic herbs. When treating food-related diarrhea, you can use Xiangji Cake, Jiajiang Guanyin Powder, and Tiaozhong Decoction, adjusting as needed. It is essential that food-related diarrhea should not be abruptly stopped; moderation in diet is necessary. Progress with food retention pills to eliminate the accumulated food, followed by Qian’s Jiajiang Yihuang Powder, which can be effective in just one dose—this is a crucial treatment method. Following this, use Yigong Powder or Sijunzi Decoction for recovery to ensure full safety. For those with abdominal rumbling and diarrhea, Shengjiang Xiaoxin Decoction is indicated. If it is a case of cold accumulation causing diarrhea, use Xiangpu Powder to stop it. Baizhu Powder can harmonize qi and regulate the stomach; Tiaozhong Powder and Bao’an Pills can stop food-related diarrhea, while Ganying Pills, Chenxiang Decoction, and Sanling Decoction are also applicable.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Surprise Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Zhongyang says: After a slow onset of surprise illness, one might vomit and have diarrhea due to stomach deficiency, or feel weak due to fright; with white in the eyes resembling light ink and feces being greenish-yellow, this diarrhea should be treated with warming and tonifying remedies, primarily using the Sacred Life Preservation Pill and the Diaoteng Decoction. If there is milk alongside the feces, it can be treated with the Milk Dissolving Pill or the Eating Enhancement Pill. If there is slight thirst, with heart and spleen symptoms leading to agitation and frenzy, this diarrhea is particularly difficult to treat; use the cinnabar Wuling powder. For cold cases, prescribe the Determining Life Decoction, followed by the Warm Surprise Pill from Zhu Jun and the Sleep-Inducing Great Unity Pill.</p>
<p><strong>Cholera Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang says: Vomiting and diarrhea with strong heat and lack of appetite, or undigested milk indicates injury to the milk, thus one should take Werther&#39;s Cake after which use Yihuang Powder to harmonize the stomach. If there’s vomiting and diarrhea with body heat but no milk, and the stools are greenish-white, this indicates excess above and deficiency below; use Yihuang Powder with adjustments to treat it. Generally, vomiting and diarrhea with body heat, alternating between cool and heat sensations, coarse energy, and yellow stools, along with vomiting undigested milk indicates a wind-heat injury; start with Daqing Gao to disperse, then take Yihuang Powder to harmonize the stomach. If there is a fever with vomiting and diarrhea after the summer solstice, or if undigested milk leads to yellow diarrhea, it indicates injury to the heat of the milk; treat it with Yulu powder or similar preparations.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>For those with abdominal pain from milk discharge who cry when pressed, it is due to food accumulation; use white cake to alleviate it. If pressing does not cause crying, it is a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi; use Wumei Yigong San to tonify it. For cold hands and feet, it is due to cold spleen qi; use Yigong San with Mu Xiang. If there is a cold wind leading to vomiting and diarrhea, it indicates wind wood harming spleen earth; also use the aforementioned medicine. If one drinks hot milk and has yellow diarrhea, it indicates damp heat stagnation; use Si Ling San. If symptoms do not improve or worsen, it indicates further harm to the original qi; use Baizhu San. If there is diarrhea with a feeling of heaviness in the abdomen, it indicates a sinking of spleen qi; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If one uses drugs to resolve stagnation but feels constricted in the abdomen, it indicates a deficiency and stagnation of spleen qi; use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If there is a yellow complexion and green diarrhea, it suggests spleen deficiency with liver overacting; use Liu Jun, Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, and Mu Xiang. If there is frequent belching with yellow diarrhea, it indicates a deficiency of heart and spleen qi; use Liu Jun, Pao Jiang, and Sheng Ma. If vomiting occurs within the first fifteen days after birth, it is best to adjust the mother&#39;s condition, as the infant&#39;s organs are delicate and may not withstand medicinal treatment.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Vomit</strong></p>
<p>Vomit is accompanied by sound; to expel is to discharge milk and food. In general, infants should not be overfed. If they are full, they will overflow, leading to vomiting. Wet nurses, lacking knowledge, prioritize rapidly increasing the child&#39;s growth and neglect the appropriate feeding schedule. They may force feed the child while it is asleep, which becomes a source of illness, gradually worsening over time until vomiting occurs. In severe cases, it is advisable to gradually wean the child. The wet nurse should take medicinal herbs to regulate qi, and the child should take digestive pills to transform milk and strengthen the stomach. Vomiting from milk has several types: cold vomiting and hot vomiting, which should be carefully distinguished. If vomit comes from the corners of the mouth, it indicates that there is too much milk that cannot be digested, and if the stomach is full, it overflows; this is not an illness and can be treated with digestive pills. Hot vomiting is characterized by a warm forehead, possibly yellow saliva, a heated sensation in the palms and soles, scanty red urine, or dry lips with thirst. This is mostly due to summer heat or heat injury, leading to this symptom. The wet nurse should take herbal remedies like Xiangru San or Wuling San, while the child should take Xiangru Tang or Wuling San. Cold vomiting involves clear saliva mixed with milk being expelled, with frequent clear urination. This occurs because the wet nurse, exposed to wind, allows cool air to enter the milk, causing it to spoil. When the child ingests this, the cold air enters the stomach, resulting in vomiting. The wet nurse should remove old milk, take remedies to harmonize the stomach, and use methods to ferment the milk, combining it with Fuling and Banxia soup, or adjusting Guanyin powder to aid the stomach. Furthermore, if there is wind-phlegm vomiting, it results from unresolved wind and vomiting with phlegm; if this persists, it can lead to wind accumulation. This should be treated with Qingzhou Bai Wanzi or Banxia San to disperse wind and transform phlegm.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea is a specific illness of the spleen and stomach. When the balance of three factors—cold, heat, and diet—is disturbed, this is an internal cause that will inevitably lead to diarrhea. Additionally, external causes such as summer heat causing summer diarrhea, and autumn humidity harming digestion can also lead to this condition. Physicians should address each type accordingly and not merely apply one method to stop the diarrhea, claiming it will treat all, as this misleads the child; is this not simplistic? If the root cause is not treated, the diarrhea may temporarily cease but will recur. If prolonged, the spleen and stomach will become increasingly deficient, leading to other conditions that good doctors cannot remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Cholera with Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>The spleen is the center of the body, and the stomach is the sea of food and water. When milk enters the stomach, if the spleen can transform it properly, then the separation of the clear and turbid fluids will occur appropriately, thus preventing vomiting and diarrhea. In cases where children continuously vomit and have persistent diarrhea, this is caused by internal and external injuries, combined with the disruption of regular intake, leading to irregular feeding and resulting in weakness of the spleen and stomach, causing the clear and turbid to mix. If diarrhea occurs first followed by vomiting, this indicates cold in the spleen and stomach, characterized by white watery diarrhea, minimal vomiting, a gentle breath, and a slow countenance, with sweating on the forehead and a sinking, moist pulse—this suggests cold. If vomiting occurs first followed by diarrhea, this indicates heat in the spleen and stomach, with rapid breathing, red lips, a flushed face upon vomiting, a full and rapid pulse, and thirst for water—this suggests heat. The differentiation between cold and heat must be carefully examined.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>In case of ailments like cold or diarrhea with a warm body, alternating between cold and heat, coarse breathing, yellowish-white stools, vomiting of milk or food, undigested grains, frequent coughing, and signs affecting the five organs, one should first take Diaoteng Powder, followed by Yihuang Powder and Xiangpu Powder to address the symptoms. </p>
<p>If there is vomiting and diarrhea, lethargy, the ability to consume milk, persistent thirst, expectoration, and yellow watery stools, these indicate a deficiency of stomach heat causing thirst and diarrhea. One should create fluids in the stomach to alleviate thirst, followed by dispersive treatments to quench thirst, such as taking Baizhu Powder and Diaoteng Powder.</p>
<p>In cases of cooling with vomiting and diarrhea, with frothy white saliva, discomfort without thirst, and bloating, the spleen needs to be nourished. One should consider modified Si Junzi Decoction, Huoxiang Powder, and Yinbai Powder for treatment.</p>
<p>During the summer, if one suffers from heat-related vomiting and diarrhea with cold hands and feet, options include Lizhong Decoction, Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder, Wushun Powder, Cheqianzi Powder, and Buhuanjin Zhengqi Powder. If symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea present with wind and severe contraction leading to chronic conditions, one may refer to the treatment strategies for weakened spleen syndrome.</p>

<h3>Vomiting and Diarrhea in Children</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kengtang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong> </p>
<p>When a child experiences both vomiting and diarrhea, it is referred to as &quot;cholera.&quot; Those who have heart pain before vomiting or abdominal pain before diarrhea are all affected by issues in the middle energizer. The upper energizer is responsible for receiving and not expelling; the middle energizer is responsible for fermenting food and generating nourishment, irrigating the body; the lower energizer differentiates fluids, responsible for expelling and not receiving. The spleen resides in the center, and the stomach is the sea of food and drink. When milk enters the stomach, the spleen is able to transform it, allowing for appropriate distribution of fluids. How could there be issues of vomiting and diarrhea? </p>
<p>All cases of vomiting and diarrhea in children arise because the six qi have not matured, making them susceptible to the six excesses, combined with inappropriate dietary practices and irregular feeding, leading to spleen and stomach deficiency, where the clear and turbid mix, causing accumulation. </p>
<p>In cases where diarrhea occurs before vomiting, this indicates a cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach. The diarrhea is often characterized by white, watery stools, with little vomiting, a gentle breath, a slow demeanor, sweating on the forehead, and a deep, soft pulse—these are all signs of cold. </p>
<p>In cases where vomiting occurs before diarrhea, this suggests a heat condition in the spleen and stomach. Symptoms include rapid breathing, a red face after vomiting, a flooding and rapid pulse, and a thirst for water—these indicate heat. </p>
<p>The differentiation between cold and heat must be carefully examined. </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by lethargy with clear eyes, this indicates heat deficiency in the stomach; treat it with Bai Zhu San or He Zhong San. </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by lethargy without clear eyes, this indicates heat excess in the stomach; treat it with Qian&#39;s Yu Lu San or He Jian Yi Yuan San.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment for Children in Summer and Autumn</h3>
<p>When an infant is born and within three days, if they experience vomiting, diarrhea, intense heat, and lack of interest in milk or food, with stool that does not digest and is sometimes white, this indicates a case of cold damage. It should be treated immediately, and the stomach should be harmonized. Use white cake to aid digestion, and for harmonizing the stomach, use the benefit yellow powder as the main remedy.</p>
<p>If the child is three to ten days old, experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, with a body that feels warm or cool, and shows no interest in milk or food, with stool that is blue or white, indicating that the upper body is full while the lower body is deficient, one sees other symptoms related to the five organs: for the lungs, there is panting or difficulty in breathing; for the heart, there is anxiety and trouble when drinking water; for the spleen, there is fatigue and excessive sleep; for the liver, there is yawning and irritability; for the kidneys, there is a reluctance to speak and an aversion to light. </p>
<p>Priority should be given to observing the child and the symptoms related to the organs. First, treat the excess condition and then supplement the deficiency, such as using the benefit yellow powder for a deficient spleen. These two conditions are particularly common in summer and autumn.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>For children suffering from heat-related vomiting and diarrhea in the summer, if the evil heat is in the lower jiao, it causes diarrhea; if it is in the upper jiao, it causes vomiting. The loss of fluids leads to thirst. Use Yu Lu San, and even if they vomit, give it to them in small sips over time, and they will surely recover in three days.</p>
<p>If the child has a high fever and a strong pulse, with yellow urine, use equal parts of Wu Ling and Yi Yuan, mixed with hot water and served warm. If the body is cool, with a weak pulse and blue urine, use Yi Huang San in the morning and Yu Lu San in the afternoon. If, after four or five days, they feel weak and fatigued, it is advisable to use Yi Gong San, He Zhong San, or Kai Wei Wan.</p>
<p>If there is diarrhea with wind, use Fang Feng and Qiang Huo, as this indicates vomiting and diarrhea alongside a wind-related liver condition causing convulsions and distress. If there is diarrhea accompanied by heat, use Huang Lian, Huang Qin, and Da Huang, indicating vomiting and diarrhea concurrent with heat-related heart illness. </p>
<p>If diarrhea is due to cold, use Fu Zi, indicating vomiting and diarrhea with kidney-related coldness, or cold in the feet and legs that is counteracting. If there is moisture-related diarrhea, use Bai Zhu and Fu Ling, indicating vomiting and diarrhea alongside spleen issues, characterized by excessive sleepiness and heavy fatigue. </p>
<p>If there is lung illness with diarrhea, use Shao Yao and Gui Xin to alleviate coughing, along with Mai Dong and Ren Shen; for severe cases, use more Bing Lang, and if there are issues with bowel movements, add Da Huang.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>It is said that diarrhea combined with lung disease causes coughing and wheezing. For diagnosis, one should look further into the conditions being new or old. If new, it should be treated to stop it; if prolonged, it may lead to the risk of intestinal wind. Therefore, it is advisable to push out the old and bring in the new, ensuring the treatment promotes dispersing the wind and guiding it outwards, followed by using tonics for the internal organs, specifically the monarch and minister herbs, and it is advisable to use Yi Huang San.</p>
<p>In young children during the beginning of summer to early autumn, if they are exposed to the wind at night, feel thirsty, drink water, and consume cold foods after meals, it can severely irritate their stomach and intestines, leading to sudden vomiting and diarrhea, which may then result in numbness of the hands and feet, with painful contractions of the muscles. If treated as a case of fright, it is mistaken. It is said that when muscles encounter cold, they contract and shorten; also, the Yangming channel supports the governing muscles, which are associated with the stomach and large intestine. Thus, internal injuries from consuming cold food and drink, combined with external wind, lead to simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea. The stomach qi becomes deficient and unable to nourish the governing muscles, causing contractions and urgency. In this case, the breath is warm, the face looks pale, the pulse is thick and submerged. Furthermore, when pressing on both knees and wrists, if one observes the muscles contracting and pulling towards the skin, these are the signs.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>To treat with reformulated warm ginger water combined with prepared aconite, taken half raw and half processed, one should brew it with ginger until well-cooked and take it warm on an empty stomach, carefully noting the balance of deficiency and excess, as well as the interplay of hot and cold for treatment. </p>
<p>There are cases where young children suddenly suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, starting in the hot summer and autumn when they are exposed to extreme heat, removing their clothes to cool off, and then sleeping in a drafty area. They first contract heat, followed by cold, resulting in the interaction of yin and yang, causing qi to strike at the middle burner, which is called cholera. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; recommends the use of fragrant herb powder for treatment, as it can differentiate between food and water, regulating the ascending and descending of yin and yang. Those with excessive heat who desire to drink water should use the Five Licorice Powder. Those with excessive cold who do not want water should use the Reformulated Pill. </p>
<p>In dealing with this method of treatment, does it not aim to harmonize the middle burner? Generally, for summer-related vomiting and diarrhea, if the hands and feet are hot and there is thirst for cold drinks, it is a yang condition, thus requiring cooling agents. If the hands and feet are cold and there is thirst for hot drinks, it is a yin condition, thus requiring warming and tonifying agents. In all cases of yin conditions, if cold and cooling treatments are mistakenly applied, it can lead to death, evidenced by the hands and feet turning blue or dark, or this condition may spread throughout the body.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Winter-Spring Treatment Protocol</strong></p>
<p>For conditions of cold damage presenting with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, intermittent chills and fever, excessive sleeping with strong breath, yellowish-white stools, vomiting, indigestion of milk and food, occasional coughing, and symptoms involving the five internal organs, one should boil the medicinal concoction for the internal organs and first take the Da Qing Gao (a specific medicinal preparation), followed by Yi Huang San (another medicinal powder). If there has been prior purging or no purging symptoms are present, one must be cautious and not purge. This indicates that the spleen and lungs are affected by cold, which prevents nourishment from entering the spleen.</p>
<p>The ancient text states: if there is a warm body with vomiting, diarrhea, and coughing, this suggests that wind wood has invaded the spleen, leaving the mother weak and the child likewise weak. The proper method is to prescribe a mixture of betel nut and cardamom to combat Da Qing Gao, followed by Yi Huang San.</p>
<p>For wind-cold with vomiting and diarrhea, alongside a warm body and excessive sleep, while still being able to eat milk, with continuous drinking and vomiting phlegm, and yellow watery diarrhea, this indicates a deficiency of the stomach with hot thirst along with vomiting and diarrhea. One should generate stomach fluids to alleviate thirst; after stopping the thirst, use dispersing medicines. To ease thirst, one can frequently take Bai Zhu San (a powder made from white atractylodes); to disperse, Da Qing Gao is the main remedy.</p>
<p>The ancient text also asserts: if there is vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by heat and thirst, with scant urination, it falls under the purview of Wu Ling San (a medicinal formula). If there is heat and vomiting, one should take Bai Zhu San first, and then boil the mixture of betel nut and wood incense to be combined with Da Qing Gao.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Wind injury causes vomiting and diarrhea, with coolness in the body, foamy spit, and stool that is greenish-white. There is a feeling of heaviness, no thirst, difficulty breathing, prolonged exhalation, and watery eyes upon waking. This is wind injury, characterized by weakness and fear, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. One should strengthen the spleen before dispersing. The main remedy is Da Qing Gao. These two patterns are often found in spring and winter.</p>
<p>Jie Gu said: When there is coolness in the body, vomiting and diarrhea occur without thirst, it indicates cold. Therefore, decoct a mixture of Fuzi and Guizhi to administer Da Qing Gao.</p>
<p>Children affected by wind and cold experience vomiting and diarrhea. The physician diagnoses it as spleen deficiency and prescribes warming tonics, but when it does not improve and cooling medications are used, it cannot disperse. This is considered a primary wind injury; the physician indiscriminately attacks it. Due to spleen cold and deficiency, the body cannot disperse internally nor resolve externally. After more than ten days, symptoms often include watery eyes and a warm body, with wind affecting the spleen and stomach, leading to loose stools. One should eliminate wind from the spleen; once the wind retreats, dysentery ceases. The main remedy for this is Xuan Feng San. Later, use Shi Jun Zi Wan to tonify the stomach. In cases of prolonged vomiting and diarrhea that do not heal, it indicates spleen deficiency leading to wind, resulting in chronic shock.</p>
<p>Excessive vomiting and diarrhea weaken the spleen and stomach and may lead to the emergence of wind. In such cases, prescribe Si Jun Zi Decoction with an increased dose of Bai Fuzi reduced by half, boiled with fresh ginger for consumption.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Body heat with yellow diarrhea and thirst is treated with cooling agents.</p>
<p>Zeng said: If one vomits first and then experiences diarrhea, it indicates heat in the spleen and stomach, with rapid breathing and red lips, vomiting leading to a flushed face, and a vigorous pulse. Thirst for water indicates heat. Qian suggested treating heat-related illnesses with a combination of Yulu powder and Yihuang powder in summer and autumn, and with Baizhu powder and Daqing paste in spring and winter.</p>
<p>Body cold with green diarrhea and no thirst is treated with warming medicine.</p>
<p>Zeng said: If one has diarrhea first and then vomits, it indicates cold due to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, presenting with clear or white diarrhea, minimal vomiting, gentle breath, slow complexion, sweating on the forehead, and a deep, soft pulse, indicating cold. Qian suggested treating cold-related illnesses with Yihuang powder in autumn and alternating Yihuang powder and Daqing paste in winter and spring. For symptoms of abdominal distension or reversal, with a sunken forehead, the Four Gentlemen decoction with additions of Huoxiang, Dingxiang, and Shaoyao should be prepared.</p>
<p>Body warmth with yellow or white diarrhea and thirst indicates a mixed condition of cold and heat.</p>
<p>Qian’s treatment method includes alternating Yulu powder and Yihuang powder in summer and autumn, and Yihuang powder and Daqing paste in winter and spring.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>宿食</strong></p>
<p>Qian said: If there is vomiting and diarrhea with unprocessed milk, it indicates food damage, and it is appropriate to purge it. Feng Chengwu&#39;s child, five years old, experienced vomiting and diarrhea with high fever, showing no desire for food or drink. Qian observed that the child had more white in the eyes than black, and his complexion was pale, saying: This child must have many illnesses. A pale complexion indicates a lack of vitality. Few black eyes suggest renal deficiency. Since black eyes represent water, the inherent weakness and deficiency lead to frequent illness. If this continues into adulthood, the skin and flesh won&#39;t be robust, and he will be sensitive to cold and heat, easily fluctuating between deficiency and excess. The spleen and stomach are also weak, so indulgence in alcohol should be avoided. Without proper care, he won&#39;t survive past youth. </p>
<p>If the face lacks luster and spirit, it resembles a woman who has lost blood. Now, if there is vomiting and diarrhea with high fever and no appetite, it signifies food damage. Additionally, if there is weakness, purging should be avoided; if purged while weak, it leads to coughing if it enters the lungs, fright if it enters the heart, diarrhea if it enters the spleen, and further deficiency if it enters the kidneys. It is better to dissolve a digestive pill to provide some nourishment. If the damage is severe, purging may be necessary; otherwise, it can lead to a lasting condition. If there is impacted food inside, purging is also possible. After purging, reinforcing the spleen will ensure recovery. There is no case where this does not work, according to the state of deficiency and excess.</p>
<p>Qian further stated: Vomiting milk and diarrhea with a yellow tint indicates damage from hot milk; with a blue tint, it indicates damage from cold milk. Both should be purged as a method of addressing the issue. However, for damage from heat, use Wuling Powder to guide the reverse effect; for cold damage, use Lizhong Decoction to warm the interior, which will naturally restore balance.</p>
<p>If there is still stagnation in the spleen channel and then further food damage occurs, if there is no vomiting it leads to diarrhea; if no diarrhea, it leads to vomiting. It is advisable to use Sanddough Powder to dissolve stagnation and to guard the stomach with Hezhong Powder to harmonize the interior.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from irregular temperature and breastfeeding, the interplay of clear and turbid energies disrupts the stomach and intestines, leading to cholera and abdominal pain. Cold energy clashes with vital energy, sometimes attacking the heart from above and sometimes the abdomen from below, resulting in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Contraindications</strong></p>
<p>Zheng states: When a child has vomiting and diarrhea due to external cold or wind injuries, or internal injury from milk and food, or if the child’s crying is unsettled and their breath is unregulated, if they continue to breastfeed, the breath may reverse upwards, causing stagnation in the chest and leading to vomiting; if it reverses downwards, it harms the spleen and stomach, resulting in diarrhea; when breath reverses both up and down, vomiting and diarrhea occur simultaneously. </p>
<p>In cases where a child only vomits without diarrhea, this is a sign of reversal; there will be phlegm with the vomiting, and those who show signs of shock, ten out of one hundred do not survive. If a child only has diarrhea without vomiting, or experiences both together, and this persists over time, it may transform into convulsions. Treatment involves temporarily stopping breastfeeding; for mild cases, a few hours, and for severe cases, three days. It is advisable to frequently provide diluted porridge and administer medication for quick effect, with a success rate of eighty to ninety percent.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>It may be doubted whether this is true, but the life of a child depends on milk, and they are unwilling to stop it even temporarily. However, milk indeed cannot be stopped, yet they do not realize that those harmed by milk, if they continue to consume it recklessly, are like trying to put out a fire with more kindling—such remedies will be of no benefit at all. Among those who continue taking medicine and find peace, their ailments are likely minor. Yet there are many who, due to light issues, become gravely ill. </p>
<p>The &quot;Book of Nurturing Young Hearts&quot; states that when a child experiences continuous vomiting and diarrhea, it is imperative to reduce milk intake, administering medicine slowly for stabilization. Reducing means to cut back; for a day, offering only three or five times, and not overfeeding at each time. This will alleviate vomiting, and occasionally giving thin porridge can also help harmonize the stomach. It is often observed that those who do not grasp this principle rush to give medicine in hopes of quick results, abruptly stopping milk for three to four days, leading to extreme hunger and weakened stomachs, resulting in unending cries, which aggravates the condition. </p>
<p>Food is essential to life, and a child cannot survive without milk; how can one completely stop their milk? Yet milk is akin to blood, which is yin in nature and cold. Excessive vomiting leads to a weak stomach, thus the need to reduce it. Physicians must understand this thoroughly, and wet nurses should also take medicine that harmonizes qi and nourishes the blood to regulate the spleen and stomach. My humble opinion is that for older children who can eat, one should completely stop milk until they recover; for younger ones who cannot drink or eat, it is sufficient to only reduce the milk.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Saliva and phlegm or white-green water indicate a deficiency and coldness of the stomach. Thick saliva and blood indicate heat in the lungs. Continuous vomiting of water corresponds to heart pain and stomach coldness. If vomiting water accompanies heart pain, it indicates pain from parasites. If one is spitting out watery saliva from the mouth, they will likely experience parasitic pain later. </p>
<p>A pale face with a lack of vitality, cool breath in the mouth, no desire for food, and vomiting water suggest a need to tonify the spleen; the formula &quot;Yi Huang San&quot; should be used. During winter, if there is vomiting of roundworms, it is mostly due to cold deficiency of the stomach and the worms causing vomiting. Use the &quot;Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu San&quot; with two pieces of clove, and for this, one can apply the &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; without licorice, adding black plum and Sichuan pepper.</p>
<p>Vomiting is primarily related to the spleen and stomach. The ancients said that if the spleen is deficient, there is vomiting, and if the stomach is deficient, there is vomiting as well. In cases of nausea, there may be dry without substance, while vomiting involves substance without dryness.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>If the fingers and toes are warm, preferring to drink hot soup, or sleeping with eyes exposed, this indicates a weakness of stomach qi, and one should use Yigong Powder. If the fingers and toes are warm, drinking cold, or sleeping without exposing the eyes, this pertains to excess heat in the stomach channel, and one should use Xiehuang Powder. If experiencing thirst with decreased appetite, or if urination is reddish, this signifies weakness and heat in the stomach channel, and one should use Qiwèi Baizhu Powder. Generally, for infants on milk, the mother should particularly regulate her diet. If the wet nurse stops eating, it can also cause the child to vomit or have diarrhea, so care is essential. </p>
<p>Regarding the causes of vomiting, they are difficult to enumerate: there is cold vomiting, hot vomiting, accumulated vomiting, vomiting due to wind cold, and vomiting due to improper milk. Although the act of vomiting is the same, the symptoms differ, which will be discussed later. </p>
<p>Cold vomiting: Milk curds do not digest, frequent vomiting with little outgoing, pulse is deep and weak, face pale with slow eyes, breathing is gentle with mental dullness, and sweat appears on the forehead. This occurs due to wind-cold entering the stomach, or consuming raw and cold food, or harming previously ingested milk, leading to stomach weakness and inability to retain food, resulting in vomiting.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Should warm the stomach to dispel wind and remove lingering cold, using Danggui powder, decocted with water, ginger, and aged tangerine peel; or intermittently administer Chōnghé powder, Lǐzhōng decoction, and ginger-tangerine soup, or Dingtǔ drink. If these remedies are ineffective, treat with Ginseng and Xiang beverage.</p>
<p>Hot vomiting: face red and lips purple, vomiting occurs less frequently but in large amounts, milk has dissipated and the color is yellow, the body is very hot all over. This may be due to heat in the stomach from summer heat or consuming hot foods, with a restless spirit and much agitation; this is considered hot vomiting. One should dispel heat toxins with Dàshùn drink; use warm water to adjust to an empty stomach; also employ Wǔlíng powder and Xiǎo Cháihú decoction, adding ginger juice for gradual consumption, and use Xiāngrǔ powder for it. If hot medicines have been mistakenly consumed, first administer Lú Dòu drink to counteract, then take remedies to stop vomiting.</p>
<p>Accumulated vomiting: eyelids swollen, slightly yellow face, cold feet with a hot abdomen, lighter during the day and heavier at night, with a deep and slow pulse in older children.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>This lodging is cold and stagnates the spleen, hence the vomiting of yellow sour water; there may also be clear phlegm, with a firm and slippery pulse, caused by food accumulation, leading to the vomiting of sour and rotten gas; or undigested food may also expel, especially in small children, who vomit milk that does not digest. First, use Five Ling Powder, mixed with ginger juice and warm water to harmonize; then administer Black Rhinoceros Pill to manage it; for the very young, administer Three-Edge Powder and Transforming Abnormal Pill.</p>
<p>As for wind-cold cough with vomiting: there may be heat generating wind, or wind creating phlegm, which blocks the chest, causing unimpeded lung qi and persistent coughing. This is due to phlegm obstruction causing cough and vomiting, indicating a solid condition. It would be advisable to eliminate wind and transform phlegm; first administer Clear Lung Drink, followed by Minor Chaihu Decoction for treatment. If coughing persists and the lungs become deficient, leading to a lack of generation from the earth, the face may appear pale and lips dry, with a dry cough and dry retching without phlegm. In this case, warming and tonifying is optimal, using Poria and Magnolia Decoction, Awakening and Clarity Powder, and Ruyi Paste for treatment.</p>
<p>For breastfeeding-related vomiting: if vomiting occurs immediately after nursing or shortly thereafter, this arises from excessive milk intake and a weak spleen unable to process it, hence this condition. It is like a small container filled to the brim, leading to overflow. The treatment should involve moderating milk consumption and administering Three-Edge Powder.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Additionally, if there is phlegm and wind causing vomiting, it results from unresolved exterior wind, which leads to the expulsion of milk mixed with phlegm. If this occurs frequently, wind is likely to be generated; it is advisable to take Qingzhou Baiwanzi or Banxia San. Any remedy that disperses wind and relieves phlegm can be administered. </p>
<p>For toxic gas causing vomiting, refer to later sections. </p>
<p>For vomiting due to fright, remedies similar to Zhang Huan&#39;s Sanxiandan can be used. </p>
<p>For vomiting due to accumulation of food (disease), refer to the &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot;. </p>
<p>For persistent vomiting in cases of cholera, take two qian of finely powdered Fulong liver mixed with roasted Coix seed and simmered in broth, then consume. Alternatively, using roasted white hyacinth beans mixed in broth is also effective, especially young white hyacinth bean sprouts.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For cold vomiting in infants, it results from the wet nurse experiencing wind and becoming chilled, causing wind and cold to enter the breast milk and spoil it; thus, when the child drinks it, vomiting occurs. The wet nurse should eliminate spoiled leftover milk after meals and urgently take a regulating concoction, followed by the method of brewing milk. The symptoms involve cold clean phlegm mixed with milk being vomited. If there are these symptoms and the medicine is ineffective, the stomach qi may be almost exhausted; in such cases, Ling Sha Wan should be taken. If bowel movements are regular, then Lai Fu Dan may be appropriate. The two medicines are commonly used. </p>
<p>In cases of cold vomiting, the facial complexion appears swollen, sweat may be present on the forehead, and the pulse is deep, slow, and weak; cold energy stagnates in the stomach, preventing acceptance and thus leading to vomiting. Hiccups arise from excessive deficiency of stomach qi, due to overuse of purging methods, which prevent clear qi from rising and turbid qi from descending, leading to unsteady qi flow. If wind-cold is present in the stomach, use Li Zhong Wan. If there is stomach qi deficiency, use Liu Jun Zi Tang.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>For conditions caused by cool wind, it is advisable to pinch off spoiled milk, urgently take the Li Zhong Wan, and then use the fermented milk method. If there is vomiting of clear phlegm mixed with milk, and clear, frequent urination, use the Da An Wan. If the wet nurse has eaten rich foods, use the Dong Yuan Qing Wei San. If the wet nurse drinks strong alcohol, use the Ge Hua Jie Cheng Tang; drink three to five cups of cold rice vinegar with strong liquor. If the wet nurse has eaten raw and cold foods, use the Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If the wet nurse stops eating, the mother should take the Da An Wan, and the child should take the Yi Gong San. If the wet nurse is overworked, both mother and child should take the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If the wet nurse&#39;s anger stirs up liver fire, use the Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If the wet nurse is upset and injures the spleen, use the Gui Pi Tang. If the wet nurse has a weak spleen and blood deficiency, use Liu Jun, Xiong, and Gui, and the child should also take three to five drops. For conditions of qi and blood deficiency with hot milk, both mother and child should take the Ba Zhen San, and still address the heat, vomiting, and dysentery.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Heat Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>In children during autumn and summer, many experience heat vomiting, characterized by the expulsion of yellow phlegm, a warm forehead, a feeling of heat in the five palms, and possibly infrequent and reddish urination—this is termed heat vomiting. If there is dry retching without material, it is advisable to administer Xiangru drink. </p>
<p>Heat vomiting in children arises from excessive consumption of sweet and roasted foods, or from the rich flavors of a wet nurse&#39;s diet, leading to heat accumulation in the stomach, or due to heat from the summer sun penetrating the stomach. If there are muscle spasms and symptoms of restlessness and thirst, it indicates that summer heat has harmed the stomach&#39;s energy; first, use Xiangru powder, and then bamboo shavings soup. </p>
<p>If the vomit is yellowish and the child cannot accept anything, it indicates heat in the stomach; start with a yellow purging powder, followed by ginseng stomach-soothing powder. If the expulsion is sour and foul, it is caused by food stagnation; use Baohe pills. If there is vomiting of undigested milk, it signifies weak stomach energy; administer Yigong powder. </p>
<p>If vomiting is accompanied by reduced appetite and abdominal pain with a desire for pressure, it points to spleen qi deficiency; use Liu Junzi powder with added wood fragrance. </p>
<p>Overall, it is essential to examine the fingers; if they are warm, it indicates stomach heat, while if cool, it indicates stomach cold. For heat, use yellow purging powder; for cold, use warming middle soup; if neither hot nor cold, aim to balance with Yigong powder.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p>
<h3>Poisonous Gas Vomiting</h3>
<p>Chao Shi states: In spring and summer, when a child is given soup, their intestines and stomach are weak and cannot withstand medicinal effects, leading to continuous vomiting and diarrhea. The medicine steams the organs, causing distress and fatigue, resulting in poisoning from gas causing vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<h3>Injurious Milk Vomiting</h3>
<p>When an infant breastfeeds excessively, or if the child falls asleep while still nursing, there is no sense of fullness, leading to the spleen’s inability to function and the stomach’s inability to retain, causing fullness and overflow, hence inducing vomiting. If this continues, it can lead to chronic shock. Caution is advised! In this situation, it is best to regulate breastfeeding. If severe, one should temporarily stop breastfeeding, allowing the nurse to take a soothing formula and the child to take breast-milk dissolving pills to convert milk into digestible food. If vomiting occurs directly from the mouth corners, it indicates that the milk is excessive and cannot be digested, resulting in overflow; this is not a disease, and one should not rashly administer other vomiting medications. Vomiting milk that comes out directly without remaining is termed &quot;regurgitated milk.&quot; To stop it, decoct three qian of roasted barley, one qian of dried tangerine peel, and three fen of clove in water to be taken; this will stop the vomiting immediately.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the causes of diarrhea, there are various types: cold diarrhea, hot diarrhea, food-related diarrhea, watery diarrhea, accumulation diarrhea, shock diarrhea, wind diarrhea, visceral cold diarrhea, and malnutrition-induced diarrhea. Each has its own characteristics, described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Cold Diarrhea</strong>: Often characterized by clear watery stools, infrequent bowel movements, abdominal pain accompanied by sounds, a furrowed brow, slow eye movements, a pale face, sweating on the forehead, and is often treated with warming herbal drinks, a mixture of Angelica powder, ginger decoction, and remedies such as Zhong Tang, Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, Yi Zhong Gao, and Chen Xiang Bing Lang Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Diarrhea</strong>: The stool is yellow, similar to water pouring from a tube; it stops after a bout, but reappears after half a day. Symptoms include irritability, thirst, and scant yellow urine. Foods consumed are often coarse. Initial treatments include Wu Ling San or Da Shun Yin, followed by Qian’s Bai Zhu San; Xiang Ru San is also effective.</p>
<p><strong>Food-Related Diarrhea</strong>: This arises from a weak spleen and stomach, further aggravated by raw and cold fruits, causing loose stools; it may also derive from nursing mothers consuming raw, cold, and greasy foods which then adversely affect the child. Symptoms include pale lips and face, watery and less stool, sometimes with an abnormal foul smell, and yellowed thin appearance. The initial treatment focuses on warming and regulating the stomach&#39;s Qi, followed by addressing accumulations to solidify the spleen. Suitable remedies include Chōng Hé Yǐn, a mixture of Angelica powder, ginger, and dates decoction. For accumulation, larger children may take Wū Xī Wán, while smaller children might use Huà Pí Wán or Sān Lǐng Sàn; to solidify the spleen, methods include Hé Zhōng Sàn and Xǐng Pí Sàn.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>Diarrhea is termed &quot;dòng xiè&quot; (洞泄), which arises from an imbalance of yin and yang, where the body&#39;s fluids are not properly separated. This results in yellow water being expelled with little urine produced, and the discharges become frequent and excessive. This typically occurs between summer and autumn when, during the day, one may shed clothing for relief from heat, and at night, the loss of coverings causes a feeling of cold. The clash of hot and cold leads to confusion of the clear and turbid. Additionally, it may stem from a nursing mother having internal heat, which transfers heat to the milk. If the child is abruptly fed, it causes a discord in the child&#39;s spleen and stomach, mixing and expelling the fluids. In this case, one might use Wuling Powder combined with Coix seeds, Plantago seeds, and Pinellia, boiled in water with ginger, to correct the imbalance of yin and yang. Alternatively, one could start with Dashun Drink, warm white soup, or Xiangru Powder to regulate and mitigate the condition. Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu Powder and Liu He Soup are also effective.</p>
<p>Accumulated diarrhea occurs due to a weakness in the spleen&#39;s qi, where milk and food enter the stomach but cannot be properly metabolized, leading to stagnation over time. If cold foods further harm the stomach, the condition may progress to diarrhea that persists without end, rendering various medicines ineffective. Since the condition remains in the spleen and stomach, it cannot be cured until the accumulation is removed. Therefore, one should first eliminate the accumulation before addressing the diarrhea itself; once the diarrhea stops and the spleen is fortified, the illness will resolve. Treatments such as Sanleng Powder and Wuxi Pill can be applied, followed by the use of Chenxiang Betel Nut Pill, Shenling Baizhu Powder, Hezhong Powder, and Xiangju Cake for recovery.</p>
<p>In cases of shock-induced diarrhea, the stool is dark green and sticky like glue, and one should not hastily stop it. Rather, the focus should be on calming the heart, soothing the liver, and harmonizing the spleen and stomach to digest the breast milk and food. The treatment involves first administering Wuling Powder, followed by Sanleng Powder, brewed with water and ginger, and served with barnyard millet.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>If there is a sudden scattering, administer a mixture of ginger decoction with Shenqu (divine music) and take Chénxiāng (sandalwood), Bīngláng (betel nut) pills, and Wujingdan (non-surprising elixir). </p>
<p>Regarding wind diarrhea: This occurs after a major shock or illness, with loose stools that are yellow-brown, possibly mixed with undigested food, similar to milk food. This is due to spleen deficiency. If there are dark brown stools, it relates to kidney issues, as spleen deficiency allows kidney water to overwhelm it. If one does not consume food for a long time and experiences additional shock or convulsions, one should promote kidney water flow and eliminate spleen wind, then replenish the spleen for self-healing, thus preventing recurrence. To promote kidney water, take Wǔlíngsǎn (Five-ingredient powder) with half raw and half roasted Qianniuzi, along with job’s tears in water and ginger decoction. To eliminate spleen wind, take Xièhuángsǎn (Yellow-reducing powder). To regulate spleen energy, use Shēn-líng-bái-zhú-sǎn (Ginseng, Poria and Atractylodes powder).</p>
<p>For organ cold diarrhea: The stools resemble the color of green bamboo, neither too loose nor too firm, or may present as greenish water. Before the diarrhea, there might be abdominal pain and sounds, often accompanied by crying just before defecation. This typically occurs within the first three to five months of life and does not extend beyond the first year. The initial cause stems from a short umbilical cord, with wind and cold forcing in from outside, resulting in this ailment. Initially, use a soothing drink with water and white scallion decoction to warm the center and resolve the exterior; followed by taking Dāngguīsǎn (Angelica powder), water, and roasted ginger decoction, as well as a blend of Qi regulators and Lǐzhōngtāng (Regulating the center decoction).<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Parasitic accumulation leading to diarrhea: The symptoms include a pale yellow complexion, abdominal distension, weak legs, a large head with a small neck, sparse and upright hair, emaciated muscles, a lack of appetite, cool during the day and hot at night, and possibly gas or lumps in the abdomen. The diarrhea is of inconsistent color and has an unusual odor, occurring intermittently, which may happen every month, half-month, or every ten days, with spontaneous onset and resolution, referred to as parasitic accumulation leading to diarrhea. First, administer a decoction of Angelica powder combined with Poria and dried tangerine peel; next, use black rhinoceros pill, agarwood betel nut pill, as well as obstruction relief pill, aloe pill, and myrrh pill. For the youngest children, who have difficulty taking pills, only administer the Poria powder and quick relief soup, which can lead to noticeable recovery.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>If there is diarrhea or dysentery, with a blue color and pale yellow mixed with white, cold predominating over heat, this indicates that the yin evil overcomes the yang. It is advisable to use Shou Zhong Decoction and Wei Ling Decoction, to support the exterior and rescue the interior. Additionally, the formula Dang Gui San can be combined with Chen Pi and Zi Su, boiled with water, ginger, and glutinous rice; it is also beneficial to harmonize and resolve with Li Zhong Decoction, and drink Qing Mi Yin on an empty stomach to warm the spleen, eliminate dampness, tonify qi, and clear the spirit. If there is excessive cold, add熟附子 to Li Zhong Decoction, and boil with water, ginger, and dates for consumption; next, administer Nan Xing Fu Pi Decoction, boiled with water and ginger, to harmonize the spleen and stomach and eliminate yin evil.</p>
<p>If there is diarrhea and the color is blue and pale with thick yellow foam, with heat predominating over cold, this can also result in a yellow face and emaciated body, restlessness and unease. It is advisable to use Wu Ling San (adjusted) with added Yi Yi Ren and Che Qian Zi, boiled with water and ginger for consumption; this disperses residual evil. Additionally, use Yin Chen Hao and Zhi Zi Ren in a decoction, mix with fine powder of Wu Ling San for warm consumption, to reduce yellowishness and dispel yang toxins; and also administer Dang Gui San, boiled with water, ginger, and dates, or take Wan An Drink and Si Shen Wan.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Cold Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Tang stated: Cold diarrhea arises from deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach. Water fails to transform and therefore leads to diarrhea. Qian Zhongyang said: If a child is unable to consume milk, has brown diarrhea, and feels cold with no warmth in the body, one should use a modified version of the Yi Huang San. If the stools are bluish-white, and there is no thirst or impatience, it is cold accumulation diarrhea, and should be treated with Li Zhong Tang. If one is exposed to wind-cold air through the mouth and nose, and the spleen and stomach are affected by cold food, first use Li Zhong Tang, followed by Yi Gong San. When the fire of the Mingmen is weak, it cannot warm the qi of the Middle Jiao; therefore, those with cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach should use Yi Huang San and Ba Wei Wan. For individuals with weak spleen and stomach, use Wu Wei Yi Gong San; for those with sinking spleen qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; for cold and water harming the earth, apply Yi Huang San; when liver wood overacts on the spleen, use Si Jun Chai Hu San; and for cold extremities, add Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang. The practitioner should be discerning!</p>
<p>Danxi stated: Blue diarrhea is also due to cold, and it is advisable to use Su He Xiang Wan and Ping Wei San in equal parts, mixed with honeyed water for administration. </p>
<p>Tian stated: The bluish stools are due to fright wind affecting the interior and disharmony of spleen qi; therefore, Bai Zhu Tang is appropriate.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Heat Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Xue said: If the right cheek is red and the person drinks cold water, it indicates excess heat in the stomach; use the Xie Huang San. If the person dislikes cold and prefers heat, it indicates deficiency heat in the stomach; use the Bai Zhu San. If both the right cheek and forehead are red, it suggests heart and spleen heat; use Xie Huang San with fried black Huang Lian. If the left cheek and left side of the face are both red, it indicates liver fire affecting the spleen; use Si Jun Zi Tang with Chai Hu. If a child suffers from dietary injury, use Bao He Wan; nursing mothers should especially avoid rich foods and regulate their diet. If a nursing mother’s diet leads to her child’s vomiting and diarrhea, the treatment should focus on the mother. Generally, if heat appears at the onset of illness, it is due to prevailing evil qi, indicating excess; if it transforms to cold at the end, it shows true qi being depleted, indicating deficiency. Prolonged illness with heat indicates internal cold masked by false heat. Prolonged diarrhea with depletion of original qi requires reference to previous treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Food Injury Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Dong Yuan said: In cases of food injury, there is a dislike for food. For children experiencing diarrhea due to dietary issues, the spleen is harmed, and its qi cannot function properly, resulting in undigested dairy and food. If there is foul belching and sourness, with a sensation of fullness or pain in the chest and abdomen that worsens when pressed, it indicates that the stagnant matter has not yet resolved, and Bao He Wan should be used. If abdominal pain does not worsen when pressed, it indicates that the dairy and food have been digested; use Yi Gong San. If spleen qi is damaged and there is a lack of appetite, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. For injuries from cold foods or a preference for warmth, add Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang. If dairy and food have been digested and abdominal pain has stopped, but the diarrhea persists, it indicates a loss of the spleen&#39;s rising clear qi; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Other specific conditions should be addressed according to their respective categories.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Qian said: When Huang Chengwu was two years old, he fell ill, suffering from poor appetite and diarrhea. Many doctors attempted to stop it, but after more than ten days, he became pale and weak, his milk and food were not digesting, his body felt cold, and he was troubled by a feeling of heaviness and drowsiness. They all believed he was in a severe state and called for Qian. </p>
<p>Qian first gave him three doses each of Yihuang Powder and Pulmonary Nourishing Powder. After three days, his body warmed up, and he no longer had the feeling of heaviness. Then, with a small amount of white rice porridge, he introduced another three doses of Spleen Nourishing Powder to stimulate recovery and stop the discomfort. </p>
<p>Why did he do this? The diarrhea stemmed from a deficiency in the spleen due to improper eating. Initially, he did not administer purgatives because of the prolonged retention. After ten days, the upper system was full while the lower was weak. A weak spleen qi draws the lungs into weakness, as they are interdependent like mother and child. By first nourishing the spleen, the lung condition naturally recedes, which is why his body warmed up and the heaviness disappeared. Then, only did he address the cause of his injury.</p>
<p>Someone asked: Why not purge first and then nourish? He replied: The paleness indicates the lower organs are cold. If we purged first, it would lead to significant weakness. Now, by first fortifying the spleen and then purging, there would be no weakness. After this, he provided further nourishment, which ultimately restored his well-being.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Shock-related Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang states: After a shock, one may experience vomiting and diarrhea due to a weakened stomach, or a deficiency of qi due to emotional distress. If the sclera appears pale and the stool is greenish-yellow, this diarrhea requires warming and supplementation; use the Sacred Life Preservation Pill or the Diaoteng Decoction for treatment. If milk is accompanied by diarrhea, use the Milk Dissolving Pill or Food Intake Pill. For mild thirst, heart and spleen symptoms manifesting as irritability and fever, this type of diarrhea is particularly difficult to treat; use the Cinnabar and Five Poria Powder. In cases of severe cold, the Definitive Life-preserving Decoction should be used. Later, administer the Warm Shock Red Monarch Powder or the Sleeping Shock Celestial Medicine.</p>
<p>For children with shock-related diarrhea, the liver governs emotional distress. When the liver is excessive, it must transmit to the spleen. When the spleen is weakened, it fails to properly digest food, resulting in unregulated water passage, hence the greenish color of the diarrhea. If there are also convulsions, the green color indicates liver issues and convulsions indicate liver symptoms. There are also cases where the lactating mother suffers from spleen deficiency due to shock, leading to anger and liver fire. The treatise states: anger causes qi to rebel; if severe, it results in vomiting blood and food-related diarrhea. Thus, the method should focus on soothing the liver and supplementing the spleen; one must be cautious not to use harsh purgatives. If the spleen qi becomes increasingly deficient and liver evils worsen, serious cases involving convulsions and rigidity also signify intense liver fire and exhaustion of the Central Qi.</p>
<p>Whenever signs of shock are observed, one should only use formulas like Four Sovereigns, Six Sovereigns, or Yi Gong Powder, adding White Aconite to stabilize the wind, and Chaihu to soothe the liver, thus addressing issues at the root to prevent diarrhea and convulsions ensuring restoration of calm. If symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions have already been seen, yet one is still unaware of the necessity to reinforce the spleen and soothe the liver as a means of life preservation—using formulas like Bao Long or Zhen Jing—such knowledge indeed remains quite distant.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p>
<h3>Sudden Diarrhea</h3>
<p>The Cai family states: When a child has sudden diarrhea, it is due to the weakness of the intestines and stomach, harmed by the sudden invasion of hot and cold air. If it is heat, the color will be yellow or red; if it is cold, the color will be blue or white. When hot and cold intersect, it will transform into a stasis of red and white diarrhea.</p>
<h3>Chronic Diarrhea</h3>
<p>The major treatment is to tonify the deficiency and resolve accumulation. The &quot;Classics of Phoenix Essence&quot; sings: In the spleen, there is stagnant heat causing persistent diarrhea throughout the year. The neck is soft and many people experience choking sensation, along with clear fluid flowing from the nose. At times, there is a golden-yellow appearance; if there is also prolapsed intestine, it will not retract. For physical manifestations, observe the chest and diaphragm; the chest is deeply red with sweat resembling oil. The lips are red, sores appear, and the eyes have a red pulse; if the spleen is not regulated, it may lead to death.</p>
<h3>Food-related Diarrhea</h3>
<p>Medical texts refer to this as dietary diarrhea. Food does not digest, and the spleen and stomach are cold, hence they cannot assimilate properly. It is necessary to tonify the spleen, using &quot;Yihuang San&quot; as the main treatment. If there is undigested milk food, the initial illness arises suddenly with cold air released, and the limbs are also cold. The face is pale and lacks luster, with unstable spirit; this indicates disharmony of stomach qi, which can be treated with warming medicines like &quot;Junzi Pill&quot; and &quot;Yihuang San&quot; as the main treatment. If the illness persists over a long time without recovery and milk food does not digest, there is wind-cold in the spleen and stomach. First take &quot;Yihuang San&quot; twice, then follow with &quot;Xuanfeng San&quot; to guide it out. The stomach needs further tonification, and it is advisable to refer to major prescriptions for dietary diarrhea.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Hygiene: Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>The vomiting and diarrhea in children stem from a weakness of the spleen and stomach, irregularities in breastfeeding, and external influences such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness interfering with the body&#39;s proper functions. The symptoms vary, and are described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Vomiting from birth: If a child vomits immediately after birth, it is due to residual foul blood in the mouth being swallowed into the throat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vomiting and retching, with fullness in the chest and rapid breathing: This occurs when the infant cries excessively and breathes irregularly, and the mother abruptly feeds them milk. When the child still has reversed airflow, it prevents the milk from going down, causing it to stagnate in the chest, leading to vomiting as the milk follows the reversed air. It is advisable to regulate the airflow to stop the vomiting. Ancient texts also mention that crying excessively before feeding often leads to vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vomiting with abdominal distension, wheezing, undigested milk, mixed with greenish water, and a pale complexion: This is caused by the breastfeeding mother&#39;s stomach being cold and consuming cold food and drinks, which introduces cold energy into the milk, spoiling its quality and not being eliminated before feeding the child. Alternatively, if the mother feeds the child with cold items, the cold milk and food will clash with the air in the stomach, harming the spleen and stomach, leading to reversed airflow. In such cases, it is advisable to warm the stomach to stop the vomiting and regulate the airflow.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>If there is significant injury with stagnation, one should use stabilizing medicine to alleviate it; do not rush to take action, for fear that the spleen and stomach may become more deficient and generate wind. For all milk that has turned bad due to wind and cold, it should be squeezed out, and the breastfeeding child should be temporarily weaned. The wet nurse should take medicine to warm her abdomen before feeding the child again. If the milk is not squeezed out, it not only causes the child to vomit but can also allow cold to enter the already deficient stomach and intestines, leading to diarrhea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For vomiting, fever, and curdled milk, there is heat in the stomach. This may be due to the milk being overheated, or from consuming alcohol, which heats the milk, spoiling its quality, and if not squeezed out, it continues to be fed to the child. Alternatively, if the child nurses while hot, the heat can enter the stomach, battling with vital energy and causing a reverse reaction, leading to vomiting. If the symptoms are like this, and there has been a buildup of heat for a long time, sores will likely develop on the limbs, accompanied by excessive thirst and a yellowish complexion; gentle purgation is advisable. In the case of deficiency, use stabilizing medicine to alleviate it, then regulate the vital energy.</p>
<p>For vomiting, fever, cyanotic nose, yawning, restlessness, and hot breath at night, this is due to a cold invasion causing vomiting. This occurs due to improper release, where cold wind attacks the blood and energy, hence the fever, yawning, and restlessness with hot breath. If the energy cannot flow smoothly, this results in a reverse reaction and vomiting.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>It is advisable to regulate the qi to stop vomiting and disperse wind and cold. </p>
<p>For vomit and nausea, with black lips and a yellow face, frequent crying with phlegm, and foul breath, this indicates damage to the spleen and stomach; it is wise to first purge, then regulate the qi. </p>
<p>For vomit and nausea that occur with fever in the morning and evening, and disturbed sleep, this indicates shock-induced vomiting. Heart heat leads to shock, which disrupts sleep and causes restlessness. When the heart is unsettled, qi and blood become chaotic, resulting in vomiting. Therefore, it is necessary to calm the shock, eliminate heat, and stop the vomiting.</p>
<p>For vomit and nausea with a pale face lacking vitality, cold breath in the mouth, frequent swallowing without desire for food, and vomiting water, this suggests disharmony in the stomach qi; it is advisable to tonify the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>For vomit and nausea with yellow phlegm that is thick and obstructive, this signifies stomach heat. If the expelled phlegm is white and thin or foamy, the stomach is in a state of deficiency and cold. The hot condition should be treated with slight purging, while the cold condition should be supplemented with warmth.</p>
<p>For vomit, nausea, and the presence of blood, this indicates lung heat. If protracted, it can lead to lung deficiency and atrophy.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>In the past, when Qian Yi treated the four-year-old son of Duan Zhai, the boy had a fever, was coughing up phlegm, and had coughed up blood for several days. Other doctors used Platycodon Decoction and Stephania Powder but had no success. The boy continued to cough, with phlegm rising, and could not stop wheezing. Thus, they requested Yi to treat him. He prescribed a large dose of an emetic and also used Lung Nourishing Decoction and Spleen Strengthening Powder as treatment. Yi stated: This child is coughing up blood due to lung deficiency. Although he coughs up blood, it is because of heat. Over time, it can lead to weakness. Currently, the phlegm is rising, and he is vomiting; we need to expel that phlegm. If he does not vomit the phlegm, it will not be very beneficial, as expelling the phlegm can weaken him and also cause panic. When the phlegm is obstructing upward, it can also lead to convulsions. Therefore, it is appropriate to first resolve the phlegm and then nourish the spleen and lungs; it is vital to expel the phlegm for a proper treatment. If we first nourish the lungs, it would be contrary to the approach. The medicinal formula used by Yi is recorded in the collection; this is what is meant by understanding the priorities in treating diseases.</p>
<p>The terms &quot;retching&quot; and &quot;vomiting&quot; differ. Vomiting occurs when evil forces obstruct the stomach Qi, causing it to reverse and rise, preventing the transformation and movement of food, thus being expelled with the Qi. Retching, on the other hand, is merely the Qi reversing and the desire to vomit, but if vomiting occurs, food will not be expelled, hence it is commonly referred to as dry heaving. Retching can also happen when a child sucks too much milk, causing the stomach to overflow, which is commonly termed &quot;milk overflow.&quot; To remedy this, it is best to let the child suck an empty breast immediately. However, if they continue to suck frequently for a long time, it can also lead to illness.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea that is white in color is considered cold diarrhea. This occurs when a child&#39;s stomach and intestines are weak, leading to an expulsion of wind and cold, or due to consuming cold foods and drinks that enter the stomach and intestines, causing coldness to clash and result in diarrhea. If the stool is white and accompanied by a pale face or abdominal pain, one should harmonize the middle. If there is also an injury from wind and cold, with repeated bouts, and if the cold is severe, then diarrhea may become persistent and lead to a more serious condition.</p>
<p>Diarrhea that is red in color is considered hot diarrhea. This happens when a child’s stomach and intestines are originally accompanied by excessive heat, and wind and cold invade, conflicting and leading to diarrhea, which is why it appears red. In this case, it is advisable to mildly purge to guide out the heat and then regulate the qi.</p>
<p>Diarrhea that alternates between red and white, or is watery or contains grains, is known as mixed cold and hot diarrhea. This occurs when a child’s stomach and intestines have first experienced cold and then suffered from heat, or vice versa. With underlying weakness, the alternating effects of cold and heat cause diarrhea, thus one should adjust the balance of hot and cold and nourish the qi.</p>
<p>Diarrhea with colors of yellow, red, or black, all indicate heat. Red and black indicate toxicity, so one should mildly purge and then regulate the qi.</p>
<p>Diarrhea appearing green and accompanied by fever, or sometimes unrest during sleep, indicates shock-induced diarrhea. A child&#39;s stool is yellow, which is the natural color related to the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The color is green; the liver associated with wood represents wind. The liver&#39;s wood influences the spleen&#39;s earth, so it should be treated early. Otherwise, it may transform into spleen wind and provoke epilepsy, making it difficult to cure. The so-called green stool must be a quick and immediate response; the stool appearing blue is thus. If initially yellow and then later blue, it is not considered so. Children generally appear so; it should not be regarded as green stool. If diarrhea is a bluish white color, and food is not digested, it is called cold. Warmly tonify the spleen and stomach to dispel wind and cold.</p>
<p>If diarrhea is reddish and white, with a distended abdomen and visible blue veins, producing watery stools accompanied by crying, or if consuming soil and worms present intermittently, this indicates malabsorption diarrhea. It should be treated to stop the diarrhea and resolve malabsorption. </p>
<p>If diarrhea lasts several days, and the lips, mouth, and stool are all white, and there is considerable stool, this indicates chronic cold, with weakened spleen and stomach, risking a transformation to spleen wind causing epilepsy. Preventive measures should be taken to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Diarrhea occurring during a hot season is often due to heat and cold food. It is not harmed by heat but rather by cold. If heat injures and causes diarrhea, then there will be irritability and heat in the heart, and urination will be obstructed, with the distinction between clear and turbid lost. Diarrhea of a red-yellow color suggests promoting urination to alleviate summer heat. If urination occurs frequently with diarrhea, it indicates cold diarrhea, which is typically bluish white, with undigested food. It is advisable to warm the spleen and stomach to stop the diarrhea.</p>
<p>For diarrhea, one should not hasten to use hot remedies to stop it, as this often transforms into dysentery with pus and blood. The conditions of hot and cold should be carefully examined, and treatment should be adjusted according to the severity and urgency.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>Vomiting and Diarrhea</p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea are most common in the spring, summer, and autumn, while rarely occurring in winter. This is because both conditions arise from a deficiency of the spleen and stomach, affected by cold and heat. In winter, yang energy is predominant, with an abundance of warm food and limited intake of liquids. If a patient is afflicted, it is usually due to damage from dairy and other foods. When vomiting and diarrhea occur in spring, they are often caused by wind; in summer, by heat; and in autumn, by cold. In treating vomiting and diarrhea, one must carefully consider the season, observe the symptoms, and assess the conditions of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat. Only then can one avoid mistakes.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>Wind Cold and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>When affected by wind cold and experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, the body temperature fluctuates between hot and cold, accompanied by yawning, restlessness, excessive sleep, coarse breathing, and possible previous purging or absence of symptoms. It is crucial not to purge again. This condition arises from the spleen and lungs being chilled, hindering their function. There may be symptoms affecting the five internal organs. For those with a dispersing nature, use Da Qing Paste; for those who need to tonify the spleen, follow with Yi Huang Powder. These are the medications used by Qian Yi.</p>
<p>When experiencing wind cold, vomiting, diarrhea, with fever and excessive sleep, the ability to nurse, yawning, restlessness, hot breath, continuous thirst, phlegm vomiting, and yellow water in the stools, this indicates stomach heat and thirst from deficiency. One should generate body fluids to quench thirst. Qian Yi suggests taking a decoction of Bai Zhu and then dispersing the wind cold, also using Da Qing Paste. Additionally, if a person has symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea with drowsiness and visibly opened eyes, this indicates stomach heat; if they are drowsy without visible eye exposure, it indicates excess stomach heat.</p>
<p>In cases of wind cold, with coolness, frothy saliva, diarrhea that is light blue or white, yawning, restlessness without thirst, difficult breathing, prolonged exhalation, and drowsiness with opened eyes, this is a light and timid presentation of wind cold leading to vomiting and diarrhea, where one should first tonify the spleen. Qian Yi first recommends Yi Huang Powder, followed by dispersing the wind with Da Qing Paste. These two illnesses occur more frequently in spring and winter.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Injury from Food Leading to Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea with undigested milk and food, accompanied by a sour and foul odor, indicate an injury from food. If the vomit and stools are yellow or red, this is due to excessive heat from milk and food; if the vomit and stools are green or white, it results from cold milk and food. In both cases, a gentle purgative is advisable, followed by harmonizing the stomach. For those with deficient qi, use mild remedies to gradually alleviate the stagnation.</p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea occur within the first three days of birth, accompanied by strong heat and lack of appetite for milk, or with undigested white stools, this signifies a milk injury. A mild purgative should be administered, followed by harmonizing the stomach. For those with deficient qi, use mild remedies to gradually alleviate the stagnation.</p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea persist from three days up to ten days after birth, with body heat that feels cool, lack of desire for milk, blue or white stools, and undigested milk, this indicates a condition of excess above and deficiency below. There may also be evidence of involvement of the five organs, thus purging the excess while supplementing the deficient spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>In cases where vomiting and diarrhea are accompanied by organ symptoms, involvement of the lungs may show as drowsiness and wheezing; involvement of the heart may cause palpitations upon drinking; involvement of the spleen may lead to fatigue and excessive sleep. If the liver is affected, signs may include yawning and irritability; if the kidneys are involved, there may be muteness and a fear of light.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Cold and Hot Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea occurring after mid-May with a strong fever is associated with heat in the body. In this case, the internal organs of a child have nine parts heat and one part cold. This is due to overconsumption of hot milk or heat entering the stomach, causing the milk to not digest, resulting in deep red diarrhea. It is advisable to use medication to clear the heat, as suggested by Qian Yi, who recommended the use of Yu Lu San.</p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea occurring after mid-June with significant warmth that resembles heat indicates that there is six parts heat and four parts cold in the internal organs. There may be vomiting of undigested milk or food, and the diarrhea appears yellow with more white and a semblance of brown; this might occur regardless of whether milk is ingested or not. It is advisable to slightly nourish the spleen and emphasize clearing heat, as Qian Yi suggested using a lesser amount of Yi Huang San and more of Yu Lu San. Additionally, careful observation of the balance of heat and cold is necessary. If a child has intense heat with red or yellow diarrhea, this indicates excessive heat, and treatment should follow the protocols of after mid-May.</p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea occurring after mid-July manifest as warmth, with three parts heat and seven parts cold in the internal organs.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>One should not consume milk, as it resembles sleep; it causes stuffiness, turmoil, and a feeling of blocked energy, along with prolonged breath, sleepiness with opened eyes, pale lips, and a tendency to sip frequently without thirst. Qian Yi suggests taking a lot of Supplementing the Spleen and Nourishing the Yellow Powder before meals, and only a little of the Cooling Jade Dew Powder after meals. It is essential to observe the changes in temperature; if the body feels too warm and there is yellow diarrhea after purging, one should treat it based on what&#39;s customary after mid-June. </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea that occur after mid-August, if the body feels cold and lacks yang, one should not consume milk, and if there is dry cough and greenish-brown watery diarrhea, Qian Yi advises using only the Nourishing Yellow Powder to supplement the spleen and not to purge. </p>
<p>The discussions of heat and cold based on time and month pertain to the Central Plains; however, compared to Jiangzhou and Zhejiang, the climate is different. The regions of Jiangzhou and Zhejiang remain chilly in February and March, warm in April and May, and only heat up after entering the summer solstice in June. July is hot, and August&#39;s heat has not yet receded. Even during winter, many sunny days feel warm, while many cloudy summer days feel cold; thus, one cannot strictly apply the seasonal temperatures of the Central Plains as a universal conclusion. </p>
<p>The texts mention differences based on geography, with variations in warmth and coolness. Furthermore, each year&#39;s heat and cold follow the seasons&#39; cycles, making it difficult to strictly define specific days or months. One should observe the conditions as they arise: treat heat with heat, warmth with warmth, and cold with cold.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>When it becomes cool, treat it with coolness; this aligns with the seasonal changes, each suitable for its time. Diarrhea and vomiting during the heat of summer and autumn, where summer heat harms cold, lead to agitation of the heart, difficulty in urination, confusion between clear and turbid, and the disruption of yin and yang, are referred to as &quot;qi disturbance.&quot; Disturbance between the stomach and intestines is termed &quot;cholera.&quot; Symptoms arise from heat injuring cold, causing qi to reverse, resulting in cough, abdominal and flank fullness, elevated body temperature, disordered pulse, headaches, and body aches, resembling the signs of a cold; the upper part manifests as severe vomiting, the lower as severe diarrhea; in severe cases, the limbs may become cold and cramps occur in the legs. The method should regulate the qi, distinguish between clear and turbid, and manage the rise and fall of yin and yang. If symptoms are solely due to summer heat causing vomiting and diarrhea, there will be difficulty in urination, though the symptoms may resemble the previous ones but are milder and not comparable to cholera. The diarrhea will appear reddish-yellow; this condition is simply termed &quot;summer heat vomiting and diarrhea,&quot; not cholera.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>To treat cholera characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, if there is excessive heat and thirst, use Wuling Powder; if there is excessive cold without thirst, accompanied by pain in the heart and abdomen and restlessness with an inability to drink, one may take Lizhong Decoction; if there is severe cold with abdominal pain and cramping, and the limbs are tense, add Aconite to Lizhong Decoction; if sweating occurs with a feeling of cold, with cold hands and feet, diarrhea with clear stools, internal cold and external heat, and the pulse is feeble and about to cease, use Sini Decoction. For the aforementioned diseases, one may take Xiangru Powder, as other medicines cannot treat these conditions. </p>
<p>To treat heatstroke-induced vomiting and diarrhea, if there is difficulty in urination, administer Wuling Powder to facilitate urination, and use Xiangru Powder to alleviate heatstroke. For persistent vomiting, use Pill of the Lotus Seed or Rescuer Elixir to stop it. </p>
<p>Regardless of the timing of vomiting and diarrhea, it indicates weakness of the spleen and stomach, often leading to wind arising as &quot;spleen wind&quot; causing prolonged distress. This results from the spleen being weakened and the liver imposing its influence. Therefore, it is important to nourish the spleen and stomach to prevent them from being overwhelmed, so that wind does not arise and recovery becomes easier. </p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea have not completely resolved and there is thirst, it indicates internal consumption of fluids. Regardless of whether the condition is new or old, one should prepare and drink Qianyi Baizhu Powder to ensure adequate fluid intake. The more one drinks, the more favorable the outcome. Otherwise, internal fluid consumption will result in persistent thirst and the generation of heat, with external pathogens complicating the condition, leading to various symptoms and potentially severe complications.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In cases of children experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, there may be heat, cold, deficiency, accumulation, or fright; however, many cases arise from harm done by the wet nurse. Generally, if the fingertips are warm, it indicates heat in the stomach; if cold, it indicates cold in the stomach. If there is abdominal pain that the child wants to press, it belongs to deficiency; if it cannot be pressed, it belongs to excess. </p>
<p>In cold cases, the child’s energy is warm, the spirit clear, the face pale, and the limbs cold; there is vomiting without digestion, and the stool is blue-white. This requires the use of &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; or &quot;Yi Gong San&quot; with the addition of mint, peach kernel, and cardamom. </p>
<p>In heat cases, upon consuming milk, the child vomits; the limbs and palms are agitated and hot, the lips are red and thirsty, the stool is yellowish-brown, and there is scant, red urine. For this, add wood lotus and talc to &quot;Xie Huang San.&quot; </p>
<p>For cases of heatstroke, &quot;Huo Xiang Yin&quot; or &quot;Wu Ling San&quot; is appropriate. For those harmed by milk or food, there is drowsiness with belching, a lack of interest in milk or food, a hot belly, and cold feet; the vomit is sour and foul, the diarrhea resembles rotting eggs, and the abdomen cannot be pressed. Treatment should be with &quot;Bao He Wan&quot; or &quot;Ping Wei San&quot; with the addition of malt, Pinellia ternata, and clove. </p>
<p>For cases of wind harm, the child alternates between warmth and cold, coughs with shortness of breath; use &quot;Tian Ma San&quot; with the addition of angelica and lignum sappan. </p>
<p>In deficiency cases, if they sleep with open eyes, vomit without digestion, have unchanged stools, are lethargic and crave milk, with cold hands and fingers, pain in the abdomen that they like to press; employ &quot;Yi Gong San,&quot; &quot;Bai Zhu San,&quot; and &quot;Support the Stomach Paste.&quot; </p>
<p>For fright cases, the complexion is blue-yellow, food does not digest, diarrhea is blue-green; &quot;Liu Jun Zi Tang&quot; with the addition of bupleurum, smartweed, and aromatic wood is indicated. </p>
<p>In general, if vomiting occurs before diarrhea, it mostly relates to heat; if diarrhea occurs before vomiting, it typically indicates deficiency. If there is only vomiting without diarrhea, or only diarrhea without vomiting, one should treat from the pulse in the major diagnosis while also addressing the root cause of the illness with medicine, and not just focus on the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 436, Section on Pediatric Vomiting and Diarrhea</p>

Grind to a powder, and take three qian, decocted in jujube water. One variation adds Mu Xiang. Xue Ji states that this is a sacred remedy for tonifying the spleen and stomach. The human body places great importance on the spleen and stomach. If children have irregular feeding and cold intake, or if the nursing mother is affected by emotional disturbances, causing various ailments in the child, this medicine should be specifically used to treat it, and it works effectively. Wang Kentang notes that this formula treats weak spleen and stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, poor appetite, or symptoms of fright, excessive phlegm, hand and foot coldness, or weak spleen and stomach with cough and phlegm, or upward heat causing sores in the mouth and tongue, drooling. If the mother exhibits symptoms that affect the child, she should also take it.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Yihuang Powder is used to treat spleen and stomach deficiency with cold, leading to vomiting and diarrhea.

If it arises from the liver&#39;s wood harming the spleen soil, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chai Hu added. If there is no response or if there are cold hands and feet, indicating cold in the spleen and stomach, then add Mu Xiang and roasted ginger. If a nursing mother has a weak spleen leading to liver wood harming her child, the same medicines can be used. If the mother is angry and this affects the child, she should take an enhanced version of Gui Pi Decoction.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br><strong>Ginseng Stomach Soothing Powder</strong>: It treats conditions due to the use of harsh medicines that have depleted the spleen and stomach, which may lead to chronic fright, diarrhea, and vomiting, or gastrointestinal heat causing the above symptoms.

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>Qian Yi in &quot;Children&#39;s Direct Principle&quot; states: A certain official, the Grand Marshall, is suffering from persistent vomiting and diarrhea with undigested grains. Various physicians used warming herbs but after one day, the condition worsened with irregular vomiting and shortness of breath. Qian argued that it should be treated with cooling herbs, as the heat was internal. He prescribed three doses of gypsum decoction all at once. Others said the vomiting and diarrhea were severe and the grains were not digesting, so they recommended tonifying the spleen and questioned the use of cooling herbs. Wang Xin and many other physicians used a spleen-tonifying mixture of clove powder, giving three doses. When Qian arrived later, he said that this was inappropriate. He predicted that after three days, the patient would experience abdominal fullness and a rise in body heat with water-induced vomiting. After three days, this indeed occurred. The reasoning was that during June, internal heat was intense and when it penetrated the abdomen, it caused harm to the spleen and stomach, resulting in severe vomiting and diarrhea. The others then continued using warming herbs, further heating the upper body, leading to shortness of breath and an increased urge to drink, which would worsen after three days. Unable to resolve the issue, the physicians called Qian again. Upon observing the signs of heat, he prescribed three doses of Bai Hu decoction and additionally administered Bai Bingzi. On the first day, he reduced the dosage by two fen, on the second and third days he provided two doses of Bai Hu decoction, and on the fourth day, he used one dose of gypsum decoction. He combined Lian Dong, Huang Qing, Nao Zi, Niu Huang, Tian Zhu Huang, and Fu Ling, coated with Zhu Sha, and used five pills dissolved in bamboo leaf decoction. This reduced the heat and stabilized the patient.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>In the Guangqin Palace, the seventh Grand Commandant, aged seven, suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. It was July at the time, and the symptoms included lack of appetite, faintness, disturbed sleep, choking sensations, and retching. The bowel movements were infrequent, and there was no thirst. Various doctors treated it as a case of shock, suspecting it was due to the sleep. Qian said: &quot;First nourish the spleen, then clear the heat.&quot; He prescribed Shijunzi pills to nourish the spleen and gypsum decoction to clear the heat; he also ground mercury and sulfur into a powder, mixed it, and adjusted it with ginger water for administration. Qian commented: &quot;In cases of vomiting and diarrhea, within five days, nine parts should be purged and one part nourished; within eight days, nine parts should be nourished and one part purged.&quot; He stated that this was due to a deficiency in the spleen causing diarrhea, and if the physician treated it incorrectly, it could result in death from excessive purging. Therefore, it was necessary to nourish the spleen. If using Shijunzi pills was too slow, then it must also include warming the stomach and strengthening the spleen. A physician named Li asked: &quot;What caused the vomiting?&quot; Qian responded: &quot;A deficiency in the spleen and a lack of fluids leads to reverse qi.&quot; Li asked: &quot;What caused the diarrhea of greenish-brown water?&quot; Qian replied: &quot;The intestines and stomach are extremely deficient, leading to severe cold.&quot; Qian treated the condition, and the patient recovered.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>At five years old, Feng Chengwu&#39;s child suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhea, with high fever, lack of desire for food, and prominent whites of the eyes, looking lifeless. The teacher said: &quot;This indicates weakness in the kidney meridian; if purged, it will only worsen the deficiency.&quot; Therefore, he ground up a digestive pill for treatment, and the child gradually recovered. In general, if food is not expelled, it leads to accumulation; after purging, then give supplements to the spleen, and efficacy is assured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Door on Caring for Parents&quot; states: Liu Guangji&#39;s son from Hejian fell ill with sores at just two years of age, later experiencing vomiting and confusion. Treatments using cloves and cardamom were ineffective. Master Ma sent to his home and said to Guangji: &quot;Now there is a small formula, non-toxic, known by all. Will you accept it?&quot; Guangji replied: &quot;Surely, your words must have merit; how dare I refuse!&quot; Master Ma continued: &quot;Liu Hejian often says that Liangge Powder can treat sores; Zhang Dairen used it with miraculous results. Moreover, the Inner Canon states that minor yang leads to vomiting—minor yang is heat, not cold.&quot; Guangji was delighted and agreed. On that day, Li Erxing came in from outside, heard about the effectiveness, and remarked: &quot;Sores and blisters should not be purged at the onset.&quot; Master Ma regretted his excessive words, but since it had already been done, waited patiently. As mealtime approached, the child expelled a significant amount of yellow phlegm, and by noon, when asked, the child had already gone out to play in the streets.</p>
<p>The &quot;Baoying Jinjinglu&quot; states: A five-year-old child, after eating zongzi, began to grind his teeth and wanted to vomit. Soon, he experienced abdominal distension and confusion, with a bluish yellow complexion. This indicated damage to the spleen and earth element, affecting the heart and liver, resulting in food accumulation causing convulsions. First, the child was given chicken feather to induce vomiting of sour substances, and he quickly regained consciousness. His diet was adjusted, and recovery occurred without the need for medicine.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The Xue family&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Infant Care&quot; states: A small child in summer vomits milk, has warm fingers, feels thirsty and drinks cold water, and produces saliva. I believe this is due to heat in the stomach, causing saliva to flow. Using the Yellow Powder cures it. Later, if vomiting recurs, another remedy to relieve stagnation is used, and with thirst for soup, constant salivation persists. I believe this is due to deficiency of cold in the stomach, unable to hold saliva, so I used the Lizhong Pill to cure it.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child vomits without eating, has a pale face and cold fingers; this indicates a deficiency of cold in the stomach. I used Lizhong Decoction, and the vomiting quickly ceased, further employing Six Gentlemen Decoction to achieve recovery. Later, after injuring the stomach with food, he has abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and salivation. I first used a dose of Baohe Pill which relieved the pain and vomiting, then used Four Gentlemen and Gardenia to stop the salivation.</p>
<p>A small child vomits sour substances after eating cool jelly, experiences headaches and fever; this signifies a combination of internal injury and external infection. I used two qian of Ginseng Stomach-Tonifying Decoction mixed with ginger soup, and all symptoms resolved. Only the sour saliva remained, which halted with a dose of Da&#39;an Pill.</p>
<p>A small child injures the stomach from food, has a fever, vomits sour substances, and has persistently cold fingers. This indicates deficiency of cold in the stomach, with yin overpowering yang externally, causing false heat. I used two qian of Baohe Pill, mixed with strong ginger soup, which halted the vomiting; then, I used Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Gardenia to ensure stability.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>A small child experienced vomiting and thirst; during the hot months, sometimes using jade dew or similar drinks helped them recover. Additionally, when they suffered from food injury causing sour vomiting, I first used the Baohuan pill, and after a dose, the vomiting stopped. Next, I used the Wuwai Yigong powder, and gradually increased their diet, finally using the Sijunzi decoction to restore their health.</p>
<p>In another case, a small child in the hot months suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. I administered Xiangru drink and Wuling powder, which resolved the issue; however, their hands and feet were cold, and they slept with their eyes open, unable to eat or drink, with gurgling in the intestines that made them vomit. I intended to use a cooling medicine, but I said: this is initially heat, but ultimately cold; we must adapt to the symptoms of the time. I used Renzhong Li Zhong pills, dissolving them in ginger broth for two doses, which stabilized the condition. I then used Zushi decoction to gradually settle their stomach, followed by Liu Junzi decoction for further treatment until they recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a small child who overeats immediately vomited; I treated this with Wuwai Yigong powder and they recovered. When they experienced abdominal pain and vomiting, I first administered Daan pills, followed by the Yigong powder to achieve recovery. Later, when the symptoms recurred, I prescribed another remedy to expel the issue. They faced vomiting and diarrhea with severe abdominal pain, which ceased when pressed by hand; this indicated a return of spleen qi injury. I first used the Buzhong Yiqi decoction with additional Poria and Pinellia for one dose, followed by two doses of Liu Junzi and Shengma, allowing them to eat normally. Subsequently, they consumed raw and cold foods and experienced simultaneous shock with vomiting and diarrhea, hands and feet cold, lips and mouth twitching; I treated them with Liu Junzi, Diazhuo, and Chaihu, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>A young child experienced vomiting and fever after drinking cold drinks, with abdominal pain.

Zishuang Pills were used, and recovery followed. The child then caught a cold with coughing and abdominal distension, received other medications, developed a fever and vomiting, had cold hands and feet, and would twitch in sleep. Liujun and Diaoteng hooks were used for stabilization, and Sijun Decoction with Danggui and Chuanxiong led to recovery. Subsequently, the child suffered from vomiting and diarrhea with cold extremities, and the Zhiwei Paste was quickly effective.</p>
<p>Another child had vomiting and fever, treated with Xiehuang San, leading to recovery. Later, due to the wet nurse drinking alcohol, the child suffered from abdominal distension, vomiting, and diarrhea. Gehua Jiejing Decoction was given, and both the child and the nurse gradually improved. The child had five to seven bowel movements daily, treated with Wuwei Yigong San plus Shengma for two doses; after five daily movements, Sijun Decoction with Mujao cured the condition.</p>
<p>Yet another child experienced sour vomiting and fever and gradually improved with Baohuan Pills, supplemented with Sijun Decoction, Hawthorn, and Shenchu for stabilization. Later, due to excessive eating, vomiting recurred, treated with additional laxative pills, which led to increased diarrhea and abdominal distension, along with twitching of hands and feet. Noting the liver&#39;s wood harming the spleen&#39;s earth, Wuwei Yigong San with Chaihu and Diaoteng hooks was used to stop the twitching. Finally, Liujunzi Decoction was administered, and the child&#39;s diet gradually progressed leading to recovery.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>A small child experienced vomiting and abdominal pain during the summer, with constipation. After taking rhubarb, he recovered. Later, he had food poisoning with vomiting and fever, and after taking medicines like Xie Huang San, he still had vomiting and abdominal pain; pressing his abdomen relieved the pain. His face was pale and yellow, and his hands and feet were cold, indicating damage to the spleen and stomach with deficiency and cold. We used Yigong San with added Mu Xiang to cure him. Later, he had further food injury, with abdominal distension and pain; using digestion pills led to vomiting and diarrhea, with a heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, worsening in the afternoon. The next morning, we used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and in the evening, Liu Jun Zi Tang with Mu Xiang, which resulted in his recovery.</p>

Later, after more food retention and again using the same medicine, he had chills and fever, loss of appetite, abdominal distension, heavy feeling in the lower abdomen, and frequent but scanty stools, indicating renewed damage to the spleen qi and downward descent. We first used Yigong San with a few doses of Sheng Ma, and he gradually improved. Afterward, we added a few doses of Dang Gui to achieve complete recovery. Later, due to the anger of his wet nurse, the child developed chills, fever, convulsions, and vomiting.

The child also had grinding teeth and convulsions, with sour and rotten vomiting; once the vomiting stopped, the child felt better.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child was emaciated, with little appetite, fever, and yellowish complexion. I believed the spleen was injured, so I used two doses of a modified Liu Jun Zi Decoction with roasted ginger, which improved the child’s appetite. After removing the ginger, several more doses led to healing.</p>
<p>One child vomited milk, refused food, had convulsions in hands and feet, phlegm overflowing, cold in hands and feet, with a dark forehead and bluish lips. This was due to kidney water overpowering heart fire. I administered a dose of Wu Wei Yi Gong San with added Mu Xiang and炮姜, and after several doses without ginger, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A child frequently dry-heaved, was off milk, and had abdominal swelling. This indicated deficiency of the spleen and stomach, likely progressing to malnutrition. I used the Si Wei Fei Er Wan to treat the malnutrition and Si Jun Zi Tang to strengthen the interior. Later, after eating too much, the child vomited and had diarrhea with undigested grains, feeling weak and fatigued, with slight twitching in the limbs. I advised against medication. The next day, the vomiting ceased, but there was still twitching and diarrhea with green and yellow fluid. This indicated deficiency of the spleen-earth with the liver-wood overpowering it. I used Liu Jun Zi Tang and Diaoteng Gou for healing.</p>
<p>A child experienced vomiting and diarrhea of undigested milk and food, with pale color indicating the spleen and lungs were insufficient, presenting a dual deficiency of body and illness.

The treatment employs Yi Gong San to strengthen the spleen and lungs, and Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In a case of a child with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension who refuses milk, there is damage to the spleen and stomach. Initially, Xiang Sha to aid in digestion is administered to improve appetite, followed by the Six Gentlemen Decoction to enhance spleen and stomach function.</p>
<p>A child with alternating chills and fever, vomiting, and refusal of food will cry when the abdomen is pressed, indicating stagnation of food. Initial treatment with Da An Wan helps to stabilize the condition. If there is twitching of the lips and eyes and thin yellow stools, this suggests expulsion of the pathogenic factor and weakness of spleen qi, warranting the use of Six Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the spleen and Diaoteng Geng to soothe the liver, resulting in full recovery.</p>
<p>For a child under one year old, with shortness of breath, rapid breathing, reduced intake of milk and food, and occasional vomiting, this indicates spleen damage and food stagnation.

I used only white atractylodes, fried it yellow with soil, and boiled it with rice wash into a strong decoction, administering half a spoon at intervals. The next day, there was slight vomiting; after another day, there was no vomiting. Gradually, I increased to half a cup, and after a month, he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child stopped eating, had vomiting and diarrhea, with fever and thirst, and experienced red and white stools, sometimes greenish-yellow.

<p>A child with food poisoning had vomiting and diarrhea, with loose stools that were sometimes greenish-black, while sleeping with his eyes half-open and cold hands and feet. His forehead was dark and lips bluish. This indicated weakness of the middle qi and cold water harming the earth.

Later, when vomiting and diarrhea persisted, I first used Wei Ling Powder and then Yi Gong Powder for stabilization.</p>
<p>A child with cold and heat, experiencing vomiting or diarrhea of a greenish color, led me to believe it was due to spleen deficiency and liver wood invading. I treated him with the Liu Jun Decoction, chaihu, and shengma, and he recovered. Later, due to fright and cold heat, the condition worsened during the early morning hours, with frequent urination that persisted. This indicated liver fire and blood deficiency.

After long treatment without improvement, I noted that the fright was due to a deficiency of heart blood, and the fatigue resulted from weak qi, both caused by a deficiency in the spleen and kidneys. I used the Decoction for Tonifying the Middle and Augmenting Qi along with the Six-Flavor Pill, adding deer antler, and the child recovered.</p>

<p>A young child suffered from diarrhea, with a sensation of heaviness in the lower abdomen and reduced appetite. Initially, I administered six gentleman&#39;s decoction with four spirit pills over several doses, which gradually alleviated the diarrhea and allowed for slight food intake. I then used a few doses of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction, and the heaviness in the abdomen gradually improved. Later, due to overexertion, the child developed a fever starting from the navel, which intensified with hunger.

<p>In summer, a young child ate zongzi, which harmed the stomach, leading to vomiting and abdominal pain. I used Bao He pills, which seemed mild to him, so I prescribed a stronger dose. Vomiting and diarrhea occurred together, worsening the abdominal pain, but pressing on the abdomen did not elicit pain. I concluded that the food had been digested, leaving the spleen and stomach weak, indicating a need for warming and tonification. I continued with digestive aids; however, the child became drowsy and had convulsions. I employed the modified powder with added mu xiang, which gradually improved the condition. Later, after sustaining another dietary injury, I used another formulation to remove accumulation. With vomiting and diarrhea, lack of appetite, cold hands and feet, and sleeping while keeping the eyes open, the condition transformed into malaria.

Initially, I prescribed Stomach Nourishing Decoction with a small amount of roasted black Huanglian, three fen of Wuzhuyu, and four fen of Muxiang for the mother, and the child was given a spoonful or two which completely cured them. Later, the mother suffered from food injury and had blood dysentery with abdominal pain, and the child experienced the same condition. I treated them both with Sijun Decoction enhanced with the previous three ingredients. Confused by others&#39; advice, I allowed only the mother to take the treatment while the child received a different medicine for dysentery. The child then began to vomit instead of breastfeeding, and both hands and feet were cold. I used Wuwei Yigong Powder with added Muxiang, roasted Ginger, and Luoluo for both mother and child, and they recovered together.</p>

<p>Another child had vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, slept with eyes partly open, had a heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, and cold hands and feet. Initially, he received four doses of Liu Junzi, Shengma, and Ganjiang, which alleviated the pain and heaviness. Subsequently, Yigong Powder with Shengma and Mu Xiang cured him completely. Later, he had food injury resulting in abdominal pain. I administered different dispersing agents, revealing overall deficiency symptoms, and then used Lizhong Pills and Liu Junzi Decoction for recovery. However, with belching and saliva flowing from the mouth, this indicated spleen and stomach cold deficiency, for which I repeated Lizhong and Liu Junzi Decoctions for a cure.</p>

I said: &quot;This is shock-induced diarrhea.&quot; With the spleen weakened, the liver becomes aggressive, so we must warm the spleen and calm the liver before recovery is possible. Initially, they thought it was a simple case and used medicines for shock without success, leading to abdominal distension, heaviness, difficulty urinating, and swelling in the limbs. They then began to believe my earlier words and repeatedly sought treatment. I first used Wuwei Yigong San adding Shengma and Chaihu for several doses, alleviating some symptoms. Then I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for a few doses, slightly improving appetite. However, due to food injury combined with shock, he experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and spasms, necessitating another round of Yigong San with additional Chaihu and Diaotenggou for four doses, leading to further symptom relief.</p>
<p>Yet, he also caught a cold, leading to cough, abdominal distension, and diarrhea. Some would use formulas to disperse and relieve these symptoms, but the child experienced cold extremities and spasms during sleep. I noted that this was due to the spleen being weak and the lung suffering, severely injuring the vital energy. I used Yigong San with Zisuan for one dose to disperse the exterior evil, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Fuling and Banxia to adjust and replenish the vital energy, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>A small child, frightened, experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension. Initially treated with Six Gentleman, Saussurea, and Bupleurum, there was slight improvement. Later, after using the Wumei Yigong San, the child fully recovered. Afterwards, due to severe phlegm caused by fright, a calming and phlegm-transforming medicine was administered, but the child became fatigued and refused to eat, with diarrhea worsening. The Yigong San was then combined with Saussurea and Uncaria, and after four doses, the child was cured.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child consumed raw and cold food, resulting in abdominal pain and constipation. After taking a harsh purge, five bouts of diarrhea occurred, accompanied by belching and abdominal pain. I believed the heart and spleen were weak and cold, so I prescribed Yigong San with ginger, cinnamon, and Saussurea, but the child refused this treatment in favor of gastric fire remedies, leading to increased belching. I then added a piece of Aconite to the earlier medication, and after one dose, all symptoms improved; afterwards, I removed the Aconite, and after three doses, the child recovered. At that time, another child with the same condition who was treated with phlegm-clearing and stomach-cooling methods unfortunately passed away, with cold extremities.</p>
<p>A small child injured from eating experienced vomiting and fever with a red face. After taking digestive and heat-clearing medicines, the appetite returned, but the fever and redness did not subside. I believed the stomach&#39;s channel was weak and hot, so I prescribed Four Doses of Six Gentleman, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, and the child was cured.</p>
<p>Another small child injured from eating experienced vomiting with blood visible during vomiting. After taking purging medicine, the stools became bloody, and the lips turned pale or even blue. I assessed that the spleen was deficient and the liver was overacting, prompting me to have the child take Zhongyixitang to tonify Qi and Yigong San far from meals, allowing the saliva and blood to return to their origins, thus leading to recovery.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>A young child vomited sour milk and was treated with a combination of Four Gentlemen, Wu Yü, Huang Lian, and Mu Xiang to tonify the spleen and pacify the liver, leading to recovery. Later, the child had sour water in the mouth, and the same medicine was used, resulting in recovery. Eventually, the child vomited bitter water and the mouth was also bitter. Long Dan Decoction was employed to clear liver heat, while Four Gentlemen was used to tonify the spleen and promote full recovery.</p>
<p>A young child vomited yellow water after consuming food that was all sweet. Yellow Diarrhea Powder was used to clear the stomach heat, resulting in recovery. Later, due to cessation of eating and the use of a certain medicine, the child had a sweet taste in the mouth but did not eat, showing great weakness. A decoction to strengthen the center and boost qi was administered, nourishing the central energy and leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child suffered from food injury and belched a rotten odor. A dose of Ping Wei Powder was enough to resolve the accumulation from last night. It was noted there was no need for excessive medicine; simply regulating the diet would lead to self-recovery. Those who did not believe, and instead used other medicines to stop the accumulation, caused further vomiting and diarrhea, leading to a situation where recovery was unattainable.</p>
<p>A young child experienced food injury, manifested by fever, red face, convulsions, vomiting, and difficulty breathing with phlegm. This was due to spleen damage and weakened lung qi from improper diet. A combination of Six Gentlemen Decoction, stir-fried black Huang Lian, and mountain gardenia, each in a portion of two, was used as a single dose, resulting in immediate recovery.</p>
<p>A child from the Shen family experienced vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cold hands and feet. It was concluded that this was due to weakened spleen energy being oppressed by cold water. An initial dose of Yi Huang Powder was given, and symptoms resolved immediately, although the hands and feet remained cold, indicating still chilly water oppressing a weak spleen. A modification of Yi Gong Powder with a little Mu Xiang was used, and after removing Mu Xiang for the next dose, the child fully recovered.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>A young child suffered from food injury, developed a fever, vomited, had diarrhea, and abdominal pain, desiring to take Yihuang San. I stated: &quot;It contains clove and ginger, which are not suitable.&quot; The previous symptoms were from damage to the spleen and stomach without any cold signs. Doubting this, the child continued with the previous medicine, leading to increased pain, a blockade in bowel movements, and oral and tongue ulcers, resulting in death.</p>
<p>Another young child suffered from food injury, vomited continually, and had green diarrhea, showing a sleepy gaze with cold hands and feet, a black forehead, and bluish lips. I indicated: &quot;The green stool signifies wood overpowering earth; this might occasionally be due to loose stools from insufficient spleen qi; a black forehead and bluish lips indicate cold water countering earth, all related to a deficiency of central qi and cold.&quot; I used Wumei Yigong San, adding Shenma, Chaihu, Mu Xiang, and Fuzi, and they recovered after two doses.</p>
<p>A young child experienced vomiting and diarrhea due to intense heat. After taking Huanglian Xiangru Decoction, the condition worsened, followed by abdominal distension and coldness in hands and feet. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of spleen qi alongside the stasis of yin in summer months. I prescribed Wumei Yigong San, adding Mu Xiang, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another young child developed a fever and diarrhea around the midnight hours, and got better with Yihuang San. However, the symptoms recurred. Upon taking the previous medicine, they showed drowsiness with a sleepy gaze, thirst, reduced appetite, and frequent yellow stools. I determined: &quot;Liver excessive and spleen deficient, with original qi sinking.&quot; I employed Buzhong Yiqi Tang supplemented with Dihuang Wan, resulting in timely recovery.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>A young child suffering from summer heat, experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, with undigested food, may be treated with herbal drinks like Huanglian or Xiangru. If they present with abdominal bloating and pain, and their hands and feet are cold, this indicates a deficiency of the spleen energy with hidden internal yin. The condition can be remedied with Wumei Yigong San, adding Muxiang. The late emperor once stated: when summer heat causes vomiting and diarrhea, if the hands and feet feel warm, accompanied by thirst for cold drinks, this belongs to a yang pattern, thus it is appropriate to use cooling medicines; if the hands and feet feel cold, with thirst for warm beverages, it belongs to a yin pattern and should be treated with warming and tonifying medicines. Hence, if an adult has a yin condition and mistakenly uses cold medicines, their limbs may turn dark and cold after death, and in severe cases, the entire body may exhibit this, which can be observed.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child injures their stomach through overeating, leading to persistent vomiting and diarrhea with greenish or excessively thin stools, appearing to sleep with open eyes, and having cold hands and feet, with a dark forehead and bluish lips. I believe that greenish diarrhea indicates the liver overpowering spleen earth; if the stools are thin and white, this suggests a deficiency and coldness of spleen earth. The dark forehead and bluish lips imply that cold water is attacking the earth, all pointing to a deficiency of central energy and coldness. The condition can be treated with Wumei Yigong San, adding Shengma, Chaihu, Muxiang, and Fuzhi, resulting in recovery with one dose.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child is vomiting, experiencing fever with a flushed face. After administering digestive medicines, while the food has been digested, the fever and flush remain. I suspect this indicates a deficiency of stomach energy with residual heat. I would suggest using Liujunzi with additional Shengma and Chaihu, each twice the dosage, which would yield recovery after four doses.</p>
<p>In a final case, a young child shows a lethargic gaze, with foul-smelling stools, likely caused by drinking milk during a cross-symptomatic period. This can be treated with Sijunzi, adding Muxiang and Huoxiang to ensure stability.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>A young child vomited sour milk, and together with the Four Gentlemen, Wu Zhu, Huang Lian, and Mu Xiang, the treatment strengthened the spleen and calmed the liver, leading to recovery. Later, the child had sour water in the mouth, and the same medicine was used, and the child recovered. Subsequently, the child had bitter water in saliva and a bitter taste in the mouth. Long Dan Tang was used to clear the liver fire, supplemented by the Four Gentlemen to nourish the spleen&#39;s earth, and thus recovery was achieved.</p>
<p>Another young child had yellow water in saliva, or a sweet taste in the mouth, and everything he ate was sweet. The treatment was to use the Clear Yellow Powder for recovery. Later, milk and food were stopped, and he took medicines to overcome it, but with a sweet taste and no appetite, he was extremely weak, treated with the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Primer&quot; states: Huang Chengwu&#39;s child, aged two, fell ill from eating too much and had diarrhea. The doctors advised to stop it, but after more than ten days, the stools were greenish-white, and the milk and food did not digest. The body felt cold and there was a feeling of something stuck in the throat along with drowsiness; everyone said he was severely ill, and money was summoned. First, he was given Yi Huang San and Bu Fei San each three doses; after three days, the body warmed and no longer felt obstructed. Then, with a small amount of white cakes, he was slightly purged, and an additional three doses of Yi Pi San were given to stop the diarrhea. Why was this the case? The diarrhea stemmed from a weak spleen. Initially harming the food and not purging it left it stuck for ten days, leading to an excess above and deficiency below. A weak spleen qi pulls down the lung, hence the interdependence of spleen and lung. If the spleen was first nourished, then the lung illness would recede, resulting in warmth and no obstruction; afterwards, the harm from food could be purged. Someone asked: Why not purge first and then nourish? The response was that the stools turning green indicated a cold lower body; if purged first, there would be great deficiency. Now, first strengthening the spleen and then purging would prevent that deficiency. After, further nourishment was provided to ensure stability.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; says: I gave birth to my youngest son in the year Ding-si, during the first month, at the Yan residence. By the time of the White Dew season, just as half a circle of time had passed, I noticed the new chill arriving and feared that the thin bedding would expose him to cold. I repeatedly urged my family to take precautions, but they did not take it seriously. A few days later, he began to experience severe vomiting and diarrhea. I immediately used medicine to warm the stomach and harmonize the spleen, but it was ineffective. Then, I tried remedies like Lizhong, but to no avail. After three days, I added three qian of ginseng, along with ginger, cinnamon, Wu zhu, and nutmeg, yet there was still no improvement. By the fourth or fifth day, he was simultaneously vomiting and having diarrhea, expelling half through each, with nothing remaining in his stomach. I had no choice but to use five to six qian of ginseng, along with one or two qian of aconite, ginger, and cinnamon. As soon as he swallowed, he vomited everything without retaining a drop, and what he expelled was white and pure, still resembling milk. At this time, his physical condition was extremely critical, and there seemed to be no hope for survival.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>I sat quietly in my study, contemplating the reasons for my condition, and I measured how the cold air attacked my stomach, causing me to continuously vomit and have diarrhea. If I set aside herbs like ginseng, ginger, cinnamon, and aconite, what other remedies could there be? My skills had reached their limit; I was in a dire situation. After much thought, suddenly in the middle of the night, an idea arose: I believed my stomach had become extremely weak, and if the medicine’s flavor was even slightly unsuitable, my stomach would be unable to accept it, leading to rejection. Moreover, the salty flavor of aconite could also induce vomiting—this was surely part of the problem.</p>
<p>I then assessed the flavors of various remedies and decided that a sweet and spicy medicine was necessary, which might soothe my stomach and restore my appetite. I used three qian of pepper, crushed it, and added one liang of ginger, then brewed it with two sheng of water until reduced to eight parts. I set this aside for later use. Additionally, I took two liang of ginseng and brewed it with two sheng of water until reduced to one sheng, also setting it aside.</p>
<p>With these two remedies, I aimed to obtain their sweet and spicy essence. I then blended the two by mixing one tea spoonful of ginseng broth with ten spoonfuls of the pepper-ginger broth, resulting in a slightly sweet and spicy flavor—exactly what would be suitable. I warmed this mixture in hot broth, gradually spooning it to myself, in a steady manner, until I could consume it completely.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>After some time, all had swallowed without regurgitating, and ultimately achieved effect. From then on, the milk medicine was fine, but the diarrhea still had not ceased. From the time of the fourth watch up to noon, two taels of ginseng had been exhausted. After the ginseng was used up, suddenly there was great restlessness and moaning, causing much trouble for the family. They complained, saying that with the child&#39;s delicate organs, how could he endure such hot medicine? It would surely burn his intestines, and they were all in tears. Although I had my doubts, I did not panic. I calmly pondered that since the medicine had been administered from the fourth watch until now, if it were truly harmful, why had he been fine until noon, and why this sudden change now? It must be from several days of not eating, the stomach was just recovering, and being empty and extremely hungry led to this state. Nearby there was prepared porridge, which I showed him. He appeared very eager and rushed to take it, swallowing it hungrily, still looking for more. I then gave him a small bowl, which he devoured quickly, then still felt insufficient. I gave him another half bowl, and he quietly lay down and fell asleep. The next day, after further preparation, he finally stopped the diarrhea and was completely recovered.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>Alas! The rebirth of this child is indeed destined by heaven. However, when we examine the causes, it is clear that the body&#39;s vital energy is tied to the back. With a thin mattress and cold nights, the chill enters through the back, deeply affecting the internal organs. The methods of treatment rely on the use of medicine; if the ingredients are appropriate but incompatible with the patient&#39;s condition, achieving effectiveness becomes difficult. Moreover, if hunger induces agitation and the spirit fails to grasp its subtleties, using a cooler remedy rashly will lead to total failure, and the harm is indeed significant! Thus, I write this to illustrate the severity of the illness, the connection of ingredients, and the variability in diagnosis and treatment—matters of such importance. However, this is particularly about my own child, hence I trust this remedy. If it were another&#39;s child suffering from the same illness, and during the process of treatment with ginseng there is no improvement, they might assume the medicine is inadequate and hastily criticize the treatment, opting for bitter cold remedies, which could lead to death and yet still blame the use of ginseng. At such a moment, how can we discern right from wrong? Therefore, I elaborate on this matter to broaden people&#39;s understanding.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>In the capital, there was a young man named Qian Xuyang, who was around fourteen years old. During the summer, he sustained a spleen injury from eating raw fruits, leading to initial diarrhea followed by dysentery. Xuyang was good at medicine and understood that it was merely an injury from consuming cold foods. He prescribed warming herbs such as ginseng, atractylodes, ginger, and cinnamon to strengthen the spleen, but the diarrhea and dysentery did not improve. Instead, sores began to form on his lips and mouth. When consulting again, he said: &quot;This child is clearly injured by cold; now, if warming medicines are ineffective, what can be done?&quot; I replied: &quot;This is due to the diarrhea injuring the yin, coupled with the sudden intake of spicy foods, which has caused the empty fire to flare up. It cannot be resolved without aconite to return the fire to its original source.&quot; After two doses were administered, the sores on his lips and mouth became painfully intense, and the swelling in the throat worsened, visibly affecting his face, and his condition intensified. Again consulting, he remarked: &quot;The medications are not having the desired effect; could it truly be due to damp heat?&quot; I diagnosed and said: &quot;The pulse in the upper body and the output from the lower body indicate that this is not true heat but rather a deficiency of yang.&quot;<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>Now, if the heat does not respond, though it raises suspicion, in the end, if it were cold, it would surely lead to death, leaving no doubt. One might say that the medicine has yet to take effect. Xuyang said: &quot;There is still one proof, seemingly from true cold. The decoction used now must be extremely hot; we cannot swallow it, yet they consume it without concern, even though their throat swells and hurts, disregarding that. Could it not be a sign?&quot; I said: &quot;Exactly, exactly!&quot; Thus, we added one and a half taels of aconite, along with ginger, cinnamon, jujube, ginseng, and cooked reishi. The diarrhea gradually stopped, and with it, the swelling and pain in the throat and mouth resolved completely in less than a day. In this uncertainty, it is hard to discern, so if one does not have a firm understanding, it is exceedingly difficult to live on. Since I experienced this, I have gradually become unconfused; later, there were several cases treated similarly, all preserved. Alas! What is the essence of this path to clarity? It lies in knowing the root of the matter. Those facing cases should be very cautious!<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>A small child had diarrhea, with the stools hot and red, and the urine scanty and dark. This indicated heat accumulating internally. First, I prescribed a dose of Sijuling Powder with fried Huanglian to quickly reduce the heat. Then, I used a dose of Qiwwei Baizhu Powder, omitting the Mu Xiang, which promptly stopped the thirst due to heat. Afterwards, I used Sijun Decoction combined with Shengma to regulate and restore health.</p>
<p>In my early years in the capital, I treated a five-year-old girl from the neighborhood. When visiting a medicine shop, her father mistakenly thought a dried seed of the Croton plant was a pine nut and gave her one to eat. She bit into it, tasted the spiciness, and quickly spat it out, but had already swallowed half a seed. Shortly after, she had more than ten bouts of diarrhea. The next day, after the diarrhea, her belly and body became swollen, and she refused to eat, prompting her to seek treatment from me. Some suggested using Huanglian and Lu Dou to detoxify, while others recommended Sijuling and Wupizi to promote urination. I said, after such a major attack, isn&#39;t this a case of great deficiency? Could she withstand the cold treatment again to disrupt her spleen? After such significant diarrhea, what water remains to be expelled? Therefore, I decided to use only Shenling Powder and Warm Stomach Decoction to nurture the spleen qi. Within a few doses, she returned to her original state. Since there had been major diarrhea, why was there such swelling afterward? This instance shows that significant deficiency and cold can lead to swelling, and many cases are similar.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Directives for Pediatric Patients</strong> (Song Dynasty, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Concurrent Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>After May 25, vomiting and diarrhea with strong heat indicates nine parts heat in the internal organs. If heat injures milk and food, resulting in vomiting that does not relieve, and diarrhea that is deep yellow in color, Yulu San should be used. </p>
<p>After June 15, vomiting and diarrhea with warm body indicates six parts cold in the internal organs. If there is vomiting of undigested milk and food, diarrhea that is yellow-white, and dryness and thirst, take a small dose of Yihuang San before meals and a larger dose of Yulu San after meals. </p>
<p>After July 7, vomiting and diarrhea with cool body indicates three parts heat and seven parts cold. If not breastfeeding due to excessive sleeping, experiencing agitation and choking, with breathlessness, sleeping with eyes open, and pale lips with frequent belching, both Yihuang and Yulu San should be used.</p>
<p>After August 15, vomiting and diarrhea with cool body, not breastfeeding, dry belching, and diarrhea of dark greenish-brown water indicates lack of yang, and Yihuang San should be used. For persistent diarrhea with undigested milk and food, resulting in muscle atrophy, this indicates spleen and stomach deficiency and coldness, and should use Muxiang Wan. It should not be taken in summer; if there are cold symptoms, take it in small doses.</p>
<p>If the body is warm with strong heat, or diarrhea is red, yellow, or black, this indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, and Huanglian Wan should be used. It should not be taken in winter; if there are heat symptoms, take it in small doses.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

It is also said that if there is stagnation, treat it in opposition, even if it contradicts the timing but aligns with the symptoms. The stomach injury will cause vomiting, the spleen injury will lead to diarrhea, and if both the spleen and stomach are injured, vomiting and diarrhea will occur together. For symptoms of damage from pungent heat, with stagnation causing vomiting or severe diarrhea, use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Huanglian, Wuzhuyu, and Muxiang. If the stagnation has resolved but diarrhea persists, use Four Gentlemen Decoction plus Muxiang and Guozhi. If caused by injury from consuming cold, resulting in abdominal pain and greenish-white diarrhea, use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Sharen, Muxiang, and Paojiang. If the injury is due to fish or meat, use Six Gentlemen Decoction plus Hawthorn and Sharen. If the diarrhea is red, yellow, or of any dark color, indicating general heat in the organs, first use Xianglian Pill, then follow with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to aid the Xianglian Pill. If experiencing greenish-white diarrhea, or if milk and food are undigested, use Ren Shen Li Zhong Pill. If there is vomiting and significant drowsiness with open eyes, use Wuwei Yigong Powder. If drowsiness without open eyes, use Yulu Powder. If there is vomiting with both hands and feet being hot, or if there is a preference for cold food and drink, or if drowsiness without open eyes, use Xie Huang Powder. If hands and feet are cold, if there is aversion to cold food and drink, or if there is drowsiness with open eyes, use Six Gentlemen Decoction and Muxiang.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The two pills, Mu Xiang and Huang Lian, while capable of dispelling disease and counteracting evil, are not without damage to the spleen and stomach; practitioners should examine accordingly! If one experiences vomiting with a yellow or watery diarrhea, it indicates damage from heat in the milk; if vomiting with a blue or green diarrhea, it indicates damage from cold in the milk; both should be treated with purgatives. Vomiting or diarrhea accompanied by lethargy and an inability to be refreshed by sleep indicates excess heat in the stomach. If there&#39;s sputum and green water, it suggests a cold weakness in the stomach.</p>
<p>Note: In cases where a child is startled or when a nursing mother is angry, leading to blue vomiting or diarrhea, it is advisable to use Yi Gong San with Chai Hu. If the mother consumes rich foods causing heat in the milk, use Dong Yuan Qing Wei San. If the mother has drunk alcohol causing heat in the milk, administer Ge Hua Jie Cheng Tang, one or two spoonfuls for the child. If consuming strong liquor causes heat in the milk, or if the mother and child develop redness or cloudiness, taking three to five cups of cold rice vinegar is also beneficial; the child may take one or two spoonfuls. If the mother has stagnation causing cold milk, she should take Yang Wei Tang, while the child should take Tiao Zhong Wan. If the mother has stagnation that heats the milk, she should take Da An Wan, and the child should take Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If the mother is emotionally upset, harming her liver and spleen, leading to hot milk, use Gui Pi Tang or Xiao Yao San. If the mother has a weak spleen and low blood causing heat in the milk, use Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding Chuan Xiong and Gui.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>All five organs indicate heat syndromes, without signs of cold. However, some say that diarrhea with clear, pale, and non-turbid urine indicates cold. When food and drink do not digest but the color remains unchanged, resulting in foul-smelling vomit and diarrhea that is clear and cool, with pale and non-turbid appearance, and the body feeling cool without thirst, a weak and fine pulse indicates a cold syndrome. Although food does not digest, if the color changes and there is restlessness, thirst, and yellowish-red, turbid urine, it indicates a heat syndrome. It is commonly believed that children suffering from vomiting and diarrhea from cholera, with undigested milk resulting in white diarrhea, is mistakenly considered a cold syndrome. Zhang Zhongjing said: &quot;Heat evil does not digest food.&quot; How could it be cold!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Filial Piety in the Confucian School</strong> (by Zhang Congzheng)</p>
<p><strong>Body Heat, Vomiting, and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In the case of children with body heat, vomiting, and diarrhea, with abdominal fullness and inability to take in food and drink, one can urgently administer Niu Huang Tong Ge Wan. If the condition persists beyond four or five doses, recovery should ensue. This is because dairy foods belong to the category of water, and if severe, it results in dampness. Treating damp with drying and heating medicines is inappropriate. In cases of persistent watery diarrhea in children, one may use Wuling San and Yiyuan San each, with a dose of three to two qian mixed in fresh water, administered frequently without regard to time. If symptoms worsen rapidly, it pertains to fire, treat with cooling methods such as Qingge and Tongsheng, and those who use them should not take them lightly. This is not easy to explain without deep understanding of nature.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences sudden and persistent diarrhea, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that this is called acute diarrhea. If it persists and does not improve, it is due to excessive fire in the body. The nature of fire is abrupt and rapid. It is urgent to use freshly drawn water to prepare drinks such as Ganlu (sweet dew) and Wuling powder, or Tian Shui powder. Alternatively, one can decoct these medicines in well water, let it cool, and have the patient take it, which will lead to recovery. One should avoid cold rice husk, dried ginger, and strong purgative herbs; even if the diarrhea is stopped, it may cause stagnation in the intestines and stomach, leading to abdominal distension. The treatment must differentiate between yin and yang and promote the water pathways, which is the essence of effective treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>If a child suffers from prolonged diarrhea that persists until eight or nine months, it may develop into cold dysentery in autumn, characterized by cyanotic and white diarrhea, frequent pain, and undigested milk. One can use Yangpi pills about the size of millet, taking two to thirty pills each time, washed down with rice drink, three times a day until recovery. Yihuang powder may also be used. </p>
<p>In general, when treating children, one must avoid extreme cold or extreme hot medications, as well as harsh tonics and purgatives, or mistakenly using physic such as croton seeds, apricot kernels, sulfur, or greasy powders. Using these may cause additional illnesses. As children are prone to weakness and strong reactions, their intestines and stomach are tender and cannot withstand toxicity. When treating them, it is imperative to use methods that differentiate between yin and yang and promote water pathways, with preparations like Guiling Ganlu powder being particularly urgent.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>There are three types of vomiting: silent vomiting, which is devoid of material; noisy vomiting, which has no material; and vomiting with both sound and material. The conditions are categorized into three: cold, heat, and food accumulation. </p>
<p>For cold vomiting, the expulsion is small while the quantity is large; this indicates that the stomach is affected by cold. One may use Wei Ling Wan or ginger decoction to swallow, or treat with Li Zhong Wan. In cases of cold vomiting, food does not congeal, and there is no aversion to food. </p>
<p>For heat vomiting, one expels a large quantity with little material; this indicates that the stomach is hot. Treat with Er Chen Tang combined with Huang Lian and cooked ginger. In heat vomiting, food is digested, and there is no aversion to food. </p>
<p>For food accumulation vomiting, it is essential to identify the three burners clearly, as all can consume food. If one vomits immediately upon eating, the accumulation is in the upper burner (stomach), and one should swallow with light salt water and afterward use a goose feather to clean the mouth to expel any residual accumulation, treating with Er Chen Tang combined with cooked ginger, Shen Qu, stir-fried malt, and stir-fried almonds. </p>
<p>If vomiting occurs one to two hours after eating, the accumulation is in the middle burner (gastric outlet near the small intestine). First use Ding Xiang Pi Ji Wan to clear the old accumulation, then treat with Er Chen Tang combined with digestive medicines.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one experiences early morning vomiting after breakfast or vomiting after an evening meal, it indicates that the food is stuck in the lower jiao, below the small intestine and above the large intestine. First, administer the Dingxiang Pine Accumulation Pill to alleviate this issue, then use the Erchen Decoction combined with digestive herbs to treat it. Digestive herbs such as Shenyu, Malt, Sand Ginger, and Xiangfu should be included. If vomiting persists and none of the medicines are being absorbed, this indicates a condition of concealed stomach fire obstructing the entrance; in this case, use the Lizhong Decoction combined with children&#39;s urine and pig bile, stir-fry and prepare it for consumption, which will stop the issue effectively—its efficacy is remarkable and inexpressible. </p>
<p>If one vomits up roundworms, use the Lizhong Decoction with one black plum, a little piece of Aconite, and Huangbo and Chuan Jiao to stop it. If one becomes weak after vomiting, simply adjust with the Jisheng Pill. If various vomits are unable to absorb medicine, it indicates a deficiency of Yang due to excess Yin; adding children’s urine and pig bile is essential, as children’s urine is sour and salty with a cold nature, while bile is bitter and cold, which harmonizes with the Lizhong Decoction. This way, Yin gradually disperses and Yang can emerge; this aligns with what the Inner Canon states about addressing the root cause before the symptoms—this knowledge is not for my descendants to reveal.</p>
<p>In cases of persistent vomiting with eyes looking upwards and head leaning back, do not treat. The ancestral method for treating vomiting simply employs the Weiling Pill, taken with ginger decoction, effective regardless of hot or cold.

The main treatment method focuses on promoting elimination and lifting, and one should not apply the same treatment indiscriminately. For symptoms of diarrhea with a pale blue color, or undigested dairy and food, accompanied by abdominal pain and cold limbs, with a pale face and no thirst, this is cold dampness. Symptoms often arise in winter, and one should use Wuling Powder as a guide, swallowing the Lizhong Pill to stop the condition. If the cold is severe and does not stop, Li Zhong Decoction with a slice of Fuzi will be effective.</p>
<p>For diarrhea characterized by yellow and thick stools, abdominal pain with heat, a red face, and thirst, this is heat dampness. Symptoms usually occur in summer, and one should treat it with Wuling Powder supplemented with Talcum, Licorice, and Mutong; in severe cases, Yulu San or Li Zhong Decoction will be effective.</p>
<p>For persistent diarrhea resulting in yellow watery stools, with or without thirst, this is wind dampness. Symptoms commonly occur in summer, and one should treat it with Wuling Powder combined with Fangfeng, Cangzhu, and Qianghuo.</p>
<p>For chronic diarrhea with slippery intestines that does not stop, this indicates dampness harming the original qi leading to sinking. It is advisable to use herbs that promote lifting.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of symptoms for vomiting and diarrhea: cold, heat, and accumulation. The treatment methods are somewhat similar to those for diarrhea; those observing should examine them closely. </p>
<p>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea with flushed cheeks, warm legs and feet, a preference for drinking water, and a hot body, this indicates a heat condition. The treatment method is to use Weiling Pills or a single Jin Dan, administered with Cheqian Grass and Dengxin Decoction.</p>
<p>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea with a pale face, cold legs and feet, and lack of thirst, and if there is any heat present, this indicates a cold condition. The treatment is to start with Lizhong Decoction to stop the symptoms, and if they don’t stop, then use Yihuang Powder, or treat with Weiling Pills or Rou Dou Kou Pills.</p>
<p>In cases of vomiting and diarrhea where there is aversion to food or inability to breastfeed, accompanied by abdominal pain, and the vomit and diarrhea are all sour and foul, this indicates food accumulation. First, remove the food accumulation using the Ganying Pills, then regulate with Weiling Pills, or alternatively, Food Spleen Accumulation Pills may also be effective.</p>
<p>In cases of prolonged vomiting and diarrhea where one gradually becomes thinner and weaker, experiences thirst and heat, and if not treated for a long time, it will certainly worsen. For this, use a modified Buzhong Decoction for treatment.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, when men and women suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, the balance of yin and yang should be clear. If a man experiences severe diarrhea without the presence of yin, and a woman vomits excessively without reason, this indicates a conflict caused by cold food. If there is an abundance of material but a scarcity of frequency, this suggests a prevalence of heat that must be carefully recognized. </p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea appear simultaneously, this is termed chaotic yang and yin. A single application of the rational remedy will resolve both vomiting and diarrhea. If taking medicine still proves ineffective, add gently processed ginger. Using black plum as an assistant is excellent advice, but do not boast about it to ordinary people.</p>
<p>If vomiting and diarrhea cause persistent thirst, various soups and medicines yield no effect. If drinking soup or water leads to abdominal swelling, one may be resigned to fate, awaiting death. Quickly drink Poria remedy and often mediate for the child. When vomiting ceases, and the fire is soothed, then confirm with the rational remedy.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Hundred Questions of Infants&quot; by Lu Bosi from the Ming Dynasty:</p>
<p>Zhong Yang states: When a newborn is cleaned, if the mouth is not thoroughly cleared of filth, it is swallowed into the throat, resulting in vomiting and various illnesses. &quot;Vomiting&quot; involves a sound, while &quot;to throw up&quot; refers to expelling milk. In general, infants should not be overfed; if full, they will overflow, leading to vomiting. The stomach takes in milk like a vessel filled with things; a small cup cannot hold the volume of a large bowl. When rain falls heavily, a pond overflows; when wine is violently stirred, a cup flips over. This is a matter of logic. </p>
<p>Wet nurses, lacking knowledge, merely focus on quickly getting the child to grow without considering timing; they may continue to feed the child while it sleeps. How can there be satisfaction? The source of illness gradually develops from this.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the stomach qi is deficient, and this leads to a slow reaction, should one not be cautious? In this case, it’s best to control the milk supply, and if it’s severe, to cease breastfeeding altogether. Initially, the wet nurse can take tonics to regulate the qi, while the child should take digestion pills to transform milk and strengthen the stomach. It is stated that issues such as vomiting milk may arise under various conditions, with both cold and heat manifestations, and one must discern the differences. If the milk comes out from the corners of the mouth, it indicates an excess of milk that the child cannot digest, leading to overflow; this is not a disease. Regular use of milk-dissolving pills or various tonics is advisable, and it is crucial for the wet nurse to moderate her milk supply. For cold-induced vomiting, remedies such as Qinyin Decoction, Xiangfu Powder, and Kuai Pi should be administered. If the vomiting is due to heat, the forehead will feel warm, with yellow saliva and thirst, and the urine will be scant and red. This is indicative of heat-induced vomiting, often seen after overheating. The wet nurse should also take Xiangru Powder and Wuling Powder. Additionally, for phlegm-induced vomiting due to unresolved wind, if the child vomits milk with phlegm, and this persists over time, it may lead to wind conditions; thus, one should consider laxative and phlegm-dissolving medicines, such as Zhu Ru Decoction without cinnamon, Wuling Powder, Qingzhou White Pills, and Warm Gallbladder Decoction. Careful adjustment and treatment should be prioritized, and Zishuang Pill may also be taken.</p>
<p>Heat-induced vomiting </p>
<p>During autumn and summer, children often experience heat-induced vomiting. How can one distinguish this? Symptoms may include yellow saliva, a warm forehead, heat in the five palms, scant and red urine, or dry lips accompanied by restlessness and thirst. The wet nurse should first take Xiangru Powder and Wuling Powder, while the child takes Zhu Ru Decoction and Wuling Powder. In cases of severe heat, a modified Chai Hu Decoction without Da Huang can be used, or Xiao Chai Hu Decoction may also be effective. For extreme heat, Da Cheng Qi Decoction may be administered, and its effects are remarkable; Yu Lu Powder can also be taken.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>If a child is affected by wind and cold, or consumes too much raw or cold fruits, the stomach may become cold, resulting in vomiting food or milk.

<p><strong>Cholera with Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>For children who experience vomiting and diarrhea, some may have a warm body, while others may feel hot or cool. There are those whose vomiting and diarrhea cause convulsions, those that suffer from summer heat, and those who vomit or have diarrhea within three days of birth. It is said: If a child under three days old has vomiting and diarrhea with strong heat, lacks desire for milk or food, has blue-white stools, and cannot digest milk or food, it indicates a cold damage, and should be purged immediately; afterward, warm the stomach with white biscuits. To warm the stomach, use Yihuang Powder as the primary treatment. </p>
<p>From three to ten days later, if vomiting and diarrhea occur with a warm or cool body, lacking desire for milk or food, and blue-white stools with undigested milk or food, this indicates excess above and deficiency below; treat it with adjusted Yihuang Powder. Additionally, if there is a wind-damage with vomiting and diarrhea, presenting warm at times and cool at others, with much qi, and yellow-white stools, along with vomiting undigested milk or food, persistent coughing, and signs affecting the five organs, medicinally, one should use the Junchen medicine, starting with Daqing Ointment and then Yihuang Powder as the primary treatment.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is vomiting and diarrhea, high body temperature, excessive sleep, the ability to eat milk, persistent thirst, vomiting phlegm, and yellow watery stools, this indicates stomach deficiency with heat, thirst, and vomiting. One should generate fluids in the stomach to quench the thirst, and after that, use diaphoretic medicines. To quench thirst, frequently take Bai Zhu San; to disperse, use Da Qing Gao and Diao Teng Yin. </p>
<p>If there is vomiting and diarrhea, coolness of the body, foaming at the mouth, pale watery stools, discomfort without thirst, and shortness of breath, this is caused by a slight injury from wind leading to vomiting and diarrhea. One should tonify the spleen and then disperse. To tonify the spleen, use Yi Huang San; for dispersal, Da Qing Gao and Diao Teng Yin.</p>
<p>After the summer solstice, if there is vomiting and diarrhea with strong body heat, this indicates heat syndrome, possibly caused by excessive heat from food, leading to undigested milk causing vomiting and deep yellow diarrhea. Yu Lu San is the main remedy, and Wu Ling San is also good, with options like Xiang Ru San and Che Qian Zi San as alternatives.</p>

If the physician does not understand this, but merely prescribes cardamom, myrobalan, and other medicines, it is like pouring water on stone; lacking in diagnosis, they cannot differentiate between heat and cold, and using the wrong medication results in no effect. This condition should be verified with signs such as scanty red urine and dry mouth with agitation. The treatment principle should involve using Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu powder, excluding wood incense. Wu Ling powder, excluding cassia, can also be taken. For severe heat, Si Ni San or Da Chai Hu Decoction, excluding rhubarb, would be particularly effective. Additionally, Huang Lian Wan and similar formulas are also beneficial. The Tuning Middle Decoction, excluding rhubarb and adding Huang Lian and Zhi Ke, can be used.

When treating food-related diarrhea, you can use Xiangji Cake, Jiajiang Guanyin Powder, and Tiaozhong Decoction, adjusting as needed. It is essential that food-related diarrhea should not be abruptly stopped; moderation in diet is necessary. Progress with food retention pills to eliminate the accumulated food, followed by Qian’s Jiajiang Yihuang Powder, which can be effective in just one dose—this is a crucial treatment method. Following this, use Yigong Powder or Sijunzi Decoction for recovery to ensure full safety. For those with abdominal rumbling and diarrhea, Shengjiang Xiaoxin Decoction is indicated. If it is a case of cold accumulation causing diarrhea, use Xiangpu Powder to stop it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomit</strong></p>
<p>Vomit is accompanied by sound; to expel is to discharge milk and food. In general, infants should not be overfed. If they are full, they will overflow, leading to vomiting. Wet nurses, lacking knowledge, prioritize rapidly increasing the child&#39;s growth and neglect the appropriate feeding schedule. They may force feed the child while it is asleep, which becomes a source of illness, gradually worsening over time until vomiting occurs. In severe cases, it is advisable to gradually wean the child. The wet nurse should take medicinal herbs to regulate qi, and the child should take digestive pills to transform milk and strengthen the stomach. Vomiting from milk has several types: cold vomiting and hot vomiting, which should be carefully distinguished. If vomit comes from the corners of the mouth, it indicates that there is too much milk that cannot be digested, and if the stomach is full, it overflows; this is not an illness and can be treated with digestive pills. Hot vomiting is characterized by a warm forehead, possibly yellow saliva, a heated sensation in the palms and soles, scanty red urine, or dry lips with thirst. This is mostly due to summer heat or heat injury, leading to this symptom. The wet nurse should take herbal remedies like Xiangru San or Wuling San, while the child should take Xiangru Tang or Wuling San. Cold vomiting involves clear saliva mixed with milk being expelled, with frequent clear urination. This occurs because the wet nurse, exposed to wind, allows cool air to enter the milk, causing it to spoil. When the child ingests this, the cold air enters the stomach, resulting in vomiting. The wet nurse should remove old milk, take remedies to harmonize the stomach, and use methods to ferment the milk, combining it with Fuling and Banxia soup, or adjusting Guanyin powder to aid the stomach. Furthermore, if there is wind-phlegm vomiting, it results from unresolved wind and vomiting with phlegm; if this persists, it can lead to wind accumulation. This should be treated with Qingzhou Bai Wanzi or Banxia San to disperse wind and transform phlegm.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea is a specific illness of the spleen and stomach. When the balance of three factors—cold, heat, and diet—is disturbed, this is an internal cause that will inevitably lead to diarrhea. Additionally, external causes such as summer heat causing summer diarrhea, and autumn humidity harming digestion can also lead to this condition. Physicians should address each type accordingly and not merely apply one method to stop the diarrhea, claiming it will treat all, as this misleads the child; is this not simplistic? If the root cause is not treated, the diarrhea may temporarily cease but will recur. If prolonged, the spleen and stomach will become increasingly deficient, leading to other conditions that good doctors cannot remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Cholera with Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>The spleen is the center of the body, and the stomach is the sea of food and water. When milk enters the stomach, if the spleen can transform it properly, then the separation of the clear and turbid fluids will occur appropriately, thus preventing vomiting and diarrhea. In cases where children continuously vomit and have persistent diarrhea, this is caused by internal and external injuries, combined with the disruption of regular intake, leading to irregular feeding and resulting in weakness of the spleen and stomach, causing the clear and turbid to mix. If diarrhea occurs first followed by vomiting, this indicates cold in the spleen and stomach, characterized by white watery diarrhea, minimal vomiting, a gentle breath, and a slow countenance, with sweating on the forehead and a sinking, moist pulse—this suggests cold. If vomiting occurs first followed by diarrhea, this indicates heat in the spleen and stomach, with rapid breathing, red lips, a flushed face upon vomiting, a full and rapid pulse, and thirst for water—this suggests heat. The differentiation between cold and heat must be carefully examined.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Vomiting and Diarrhea in Children</h3>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kengtang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong> </p>
<p>When a child experiences both vomiting and diarrhea, it is referred to as &quot;cholera.&quot; Those who have heart pain before vomiting or abdominal pain before diarrhea are all affected by issues in the middle energizer. The upper energizer is responsible for receiving and not expelling; the middle energizer is responsible for fermenting food and generating nourishment, irrigating the body; the lower energizer differentiates fluids, responsible for expelling and not receiving. The spleen resides in the center, and the stomach is the sea of food and drink. When milk enters the stomach, the spleen is able to transform it, allowing for appropriate distribution of fluids. How could there be issues of vomiting and diarrhea? </p>
<p>All cases of vomiting and diarrhea in children arise because the six qi have not matured, making them susceptible to the six excesses, combined with inappropriate dietary practices and irregular feeding, leading to spleen and stomach deficiency, where the clear and turbid mix, causing accumulation. </p>
<p>In cases where diarrhea occurs before vomiting, this indicates a cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach. The diarrhea is often characterized by white, watery stools, with little vomiting, a gentle breath, a slow demeanor, sweating on the forehead, and a deep, soft pulse—these are all signs of cold. </p>
<p>In cases where vomiting occurs before diarrhea, this suggests a heat condition in the spleen and stomach. Symptoms include rapid breathing, a red face after vomiting, a flooding and rapid pulse, and a thirst for water—these indicate heat. </p>
<p>The differentiation between cold and heat must be carefully examined. </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by lethargy with clear eyes, this indicates heat deficiency in the stomach; treat it with Bai Zhu San or He Zhong San. </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by lethargy without clear eyes, this indicates heat excess in the stomach; treat it with Qian&#39;s Yu Lu San or He Jian Yi Yuan San.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p>When an infant is born and within three days, if they experience vomiting, diarrhea, intense heat, and lack of interest in milk or food, with stool that does not digest and is sometimes white, this indicates a case of cold damage. It should be treated immediately, and the stomach should be harmonized. Use white cake to aid digestion, and for harmonizing the stomach, use the benefit yellow powder as the main remedy.</p>
<p>If the child is three to ten days old, experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, with a body that feels warm or cool, and shows no interest in milk or food, with stool that is blue or white, indicating that the upper body is full while the lower body is deficient, one sees other symptoms related to the five organs: for the lungs, there is panting or difficulty in breathing; for the heart, there is anxiety and trouble when drinking water; for the spleen, there is fatigue and excessive sleep; for the liver, there is yawning and irritability; for the kidneys, there is a reluctance to speak and an aversion to light. </p>
<p>Priority should be given to observing the child and the symptoms related to the organs. First, treat the excess condition and then supplement the deficiency, such as using the benefit yellow powder for a deficient spleen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that diarrhea combined with lung disease causes coughing and wheezing. For diagnosis, one should look further into the conditions being new or old. If new, it should be treated to stop it; if prolonged, it may lead to the risk of intestinal wind. Therefore, it is advisable to push out the old and bring in the new, ensuring the treatment promotes dispersing the wind and guiding it outwards, followed by using tonics for the internal organs, specifically the monarch and minister herbs, and it is advisable to use Yi Huang San.</p>
<p>In young children during the beginning of summer to early autumn, if they are exposed to the wind at night, feel thirsty, drink water, and consume cold foods after meals, it can severely irritate their stomach and intestines, leading to sudden vomiting and diarrhea, which may then result in numbness of the hands and feet, with painful contractions of the muscles. If treated as a case of fright, it is mistaken. It is said that when muscles encounter cold, they contract and shorten; also, the Yangming channel supports the governing muscles, which are associated with the stomach and large intestine. Thus, internal injuries from consuming cold food and drink, combined with external wind, lead to simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea. The stomach qi becomes deficient and unable to nourish the governing muscles, causing contractions and urgency. In this case, the breath is warm, the face looks pale, the pulse is thick and submerged. Furthermore, when pressing on both knees and wrists, if one observes the muscles contracting and pulling towards the skin, these are the signs.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p>There are cases where young children suddenly suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, starting in the hot summer and autumn when they are exposed to extreme heat, removing their clothes to cool off, and then sleeping in a drafty area. They first contract heat, followed by cold, resulting in the interaction of yin and yang, causing qi to strike at the middle burner, which is called cholera. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; recommends the use of fragrant herb powder for treatment, as it can differentiate between food and water, regulating the ascending and descending of yin and yang. Those with excessive heat who desire to drink water should use the Five Licorice Powder. Those with excessive cold who do not want water should use the Reformulated Pill. </p>
<p>In dealing with this method of treatment, does it not aim to harmonize the middle burner? Generally, for summer-related vomiting and diarrhea, if the hands and feet are hot and there is thirst for cold drinks, it is a yang condition, thus requiring cooling agents. If the hands and feet are cold and there is thirst for hot drinks, it is a yin condition, thus requiring warming and tonifying agents.

<p>For conditions of cold damage presenting with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, intermittent chills and fever, excessive sleeping with strong breath, yellowish-white stools, vomiting, indigestion of milk and food, occasional coughing, and symptoms involving the five internal organs, one should boil the medicinal concoction for the internal organs and first take the Da Qing Gao (a specific medicinal preparation), followed by Yi Huang San (another medicinal powder). If there has been prior purging or no purging symptoms are present, one must be cautious and not purge. This indicates that the spleen and lungs are affected by cold, which prevents nourishment from entering the spleen.</p>
<p>The ancient text states: if there is a warm body with vomiting, diarrhea, and coughing, this suggests that wind wood has invaded the spleen, leaving the mother weak and the child likewise weak. The proper method is to prescribe a mixture of betel nut and cardamom to combat Da Qing Gao, followed by Yi Huang San.</p>
<p>For wind-cold with vomiting and diarrhea, alongside a warm body and excessive sleep, while still being able to eat milk, with continuous drinking and vomiting phlegm, and yellow watery diarrhea, this indicates a deficiency of the stomach with hot thirst along with vomiting and diarrhea. One should generate stomach fluids to alleviate thirst; after stopping the thirst, use dispersing medicines. To ease thirst, one can frequently take Bai Zhu San (a powder made from white atractylodes); to disperse, Da Qing Gao is the main remedy.</p>
<p>The ancient text also asserts: if there is vomiting and diarrhea accompanied by heat and thirst, with scant urination, it falls under the purview of Wu Ling San (a medicinal formula).

There is a feeling of heaviness, no thirst, difficulty breathing, prolonged exhalation, and watery eyes upon waking.

These two patterns are often found in spring and winter.</p>
<p>Jie Gu said: When there is coolness in the body, vomiting and diarrhea occur without thirst, it indicates cold. Therefore, decoct a mixture of Fuzi and Guizhi to administer Da Qing Gao.</p>
<p>Children affected by wind and cold experience vomiting and diarrhea. The physician diagnoses it as spleen deficiency and prescribes warming tonics, but when it does not improve and cooling medications are used, it cannot disperse. This is considered a primary wind injury; the physician indiscriminately attacks it. Due to spleen cold and deficiency, the body cannot disperse internally nor resolve externally. After more than ten days, symptoms often include watery eyes and a warm body, with wind affecting the spleen and stomach, leading to loose stools. One should eliminate wind from the spleen; once the wind retreats, dysentery ceases. The main remedy for this is Xuan Feng San. Later, use Shi Jun Zi Wan to tonify the stomach.

<p>Zeng said: If one has diarrhea first and then vomits, it indicates cold due to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, presenting with clear or white diarrhea, minimal vomiting, gentle breath, slow complexion, sweating on the forehead, and a deep, soft pulse, indicating cold. Qian suggested treating cold-related illnesses with Yihuang powder in autumn and alternating Yihuang powder and Daqing paste in winter and spring. For symptoms of abdominal distension or reversal, with a sunken forehead, the Four Gentlemen decoction with additions of Huoxiang, Dingxiang, and Shaoyao should be prepared.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>宿食</strong></p>
<p>Qian said: If there is vomiting and diarrhea with unprocessed milk, it indicates food damage, and it is appropriate to purge it. Feng Chengwu&#39;s child, five years old, experienced vomiting and diarrhea with high fever, showing no desire for food or drink. Qian observed that the child had more white in the eyes than black, and his complexion was pale, saying: This child must have many illnesses. A pale complexion indicates a lack of vitality. Few black eyes suggest renal deficiency. Since black eyes represent water, the inherent weakness and deficiency lead to frequent illness. If this continues into adulthood, the skin and flesh won&#39;t be robust, and he will be sensitive to cold and heat, easily fluctuating between deficiency and excess. The spleen and stomach are also weak, so indulgence in alcohol should be avoided. Without proper care, he won&#39;t survive past youth. </p>
<p>If the face lacks luster and spirit, it resembles a woman who has lost blood. Now, if there is vomiting and diarrhea with high fever and no appetite, it signifies food damage. Additionally, if there is weakness, purging should be avoided; if purged while weak, it leads to coughing if it enters the lungs, fright if it enters the heart, diarrhea if it enters the spleen, and further deficiency if it enters the kidneys. It is better to dissolve a digestive pill to provide some nourishment. If the damage is severe, purging may be necessary; otherwise, it can lead to a lasting condition. If there is impacted food inside, purging is also possible. After purging, reinforcing the spleen will ensure recovery. There is no case where this does not work, according to the state of deficiency and excess.</p>
<p>Qian further stated: Vomiting milk and diarrhea with a yellow tint indicates damage from hot milk; with a blue tint, it indicates damage from cold milk. Both should be purged as a method of addressing the issue. However, for damage from heat, use Wuling Powder to guide the reverse effect; for cold damage, use Lizhong Decoction to warm the interior, which will naturally restore balance.</p>
<p>If there is still stagnation in the spleen channel and then further food damage occurs, if there is no vomiting it leads to diarrhea; if no diarrhea, it leads to vomiting. It is advisable to use Sanddough Powder to dissolve stagnation and to guard the stomach with Hezhong Powder to harmonize the interior.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Abdominal Pain</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from irregular temperature and breastfeeding, the interplay of clear and turbid energies disrupts the stomach and intestines, leading to cholera and abdominal pain. Cold energy clashes with vital energy, sometimes attacking the heart from above and sometimes the abdomen from below, resulting in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Contraindications</strong></p>
<p>Zheng states: When a child has vomiting and diarrhea due to external cold or wind injuries, or internal injury from milk and food, or if the child’s crying is unsettled and their breath is unregulated, if they continue to breastfeed, the breath may reverse upwards, causing stagnation in the chest and leading to vomiting; if it reverses downwards, it harms the spleen and stomach, resulting in diarrhea; when breath reverses both up and down, vomiting and diarrhea occur simultaneously. </p>
<p>In cases where a child only vomits without diarrhea, this is a sign of reversal; there will be phlegm with the vomiting, and those who show signs of shock, ten out of one hundred do not survive. If a child only has diarrhea without vomiting, or experiences both together, and this persists over time, it may transform into convulsions. Treatment involves temporarily stopping breastfeeding; for mild cases, a few hours, and for severe cases, three days. It is advisable to frequently provide diluted porridge and administer medication for quick effect, with a success rate of eighty to ninety percent.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It may be doubted whether this is true, but the life of a child depends on milk, and they are unwilling to stop it even temporarily. However, milk indeed cannot be stopped, yet they do not realize that those harmed by milk, if they continue to consume it recklessly, are like trying to put out a fire with more kindling—such remedies will be of no benefit at all. Among those who continue taking medicine and find peace, their ailments are likely minor. Yet there are many who, due to light issues, become gravely ill. </p>
<p>The &quot;Book of Nurturing Young Hearts&quot; states that when a child experiences continuous vomiting and diarrhea, it is imperative to reduce milk intake, administering medicine slowly for stabilization. Reducing means to cut back; for a day, offering only three or five times, and not overfeeding at each time. This will alleviate vomiting, and occasionally giving thin porridge can also help harmonize the stomach. It is often observed that those who do not grasp this principle rush to give medicine in hopes of quick results, abruptly stopping milk for three to four days, leading to extreme hunger and weakened stomachs, resulting in unending cries, which aggravates the condition. </p>
<p>Food is essential to life, and a child cannot survive without milk; how can one completely stop their milk? Yet milk is akin to blood, which is yin in nature and cold. Excessive vomiting leads to a weak stomach, thus the need to reduce it. Physicians must understand this thoroughly, and wet nurses should also take medicine that harmonizes qi and nourishes the blood to regulate the spleen and stomach. My humble opinion is that for older children who can eat, one should completely stop milk until they recover; for younger ones who cannot drink or eat, it is sufficient to only reduce the milk.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Saliva and phlegm or white-green water indicate a deficiency and coldness of the stomach. Thick saliva and blood indicate heat in the lungs. Continuous vomiting of water corresponds to heart pain and stomach coldness. If vomiting water accompanies heart pain, it indicates pain from parasites. If one is spitting out watery saliva from the mouth, they will likely experience parasitic pain later. </p>
<p>A pale face with a lack of vitality, cool breath in the mouth, no desire for food, and vomiting water suggest a need to tonify the spleen; the formula &quot;Yi Huang San&quot; should be used. During winter, if there is vomiting of roundworms, it is mostly due to cold deficiency of the stomach and the worms causing vomiting. Use the &quot;Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu San&quot; with two pieces of clove, and for this, one can apply the &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; without licorice, adding black plum and Sichuan pepper.</p>
<p>Vomiting is primarily related to the spleen and stomach. The ancients said that if the spleen is deficient, there is vomiting, and if the stomach is deficient, there is vomiting as well.

<p>Cold vomiting: Milk curds do not digest, frequent vomiting with little outgoing, pulse is deep and weak, face pale with slow eyes, breathing is gentle with mental dullness, and sweat appears on the forehead.

<p>Hot vomiting: face red and lips purple, vomiting occurs less frequently but in large amounts, milk has dissipated and the color is yellow, the body is very hot all over. This may be due to heat in the stomach from summer heat or consuming hot foods, with a restless spirit and much agitation; this is considered hot vomiting. One should dispel heat toxins with Dàshùn drink; use warm water to adjust to an empty stomach; also employ Wǔlíng powder and Xiǎo Cháihú decoction, adding ginger juice for gradual consumption, and use Xiāngrǔ powder for it.

First, use Five Ling Powder, mixed with ginger juice and warm water to harmonize; then administer Black Rhinoceros Pill to manage it; for the very young, administer Three-Edge Powder and Transforming Abnormal Pill.</p>
<p>As for wind-cold cough with vomiting: there may be heat generating wind, or wind creating phlegm, which blocks the chest, causing unimpeded lung qi and persistent coughing.

<p><strong>Cold Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For cold vomiting in infants, it results from the wet nurse experiencing wind and becoming chilled, causing wind and cold to enter the breast milk and spoil it; thus, when the child drinks it, vomiting occurs. The wet nurse should eliminate spoiled leftover milk after meals and urgently take a regulating concoction, followed by the method of brewing milk. The symptoms involve cold clean phlegm mixed with milk being vomited. If there are these symptoms and the medicine is ineffective, the stomach qi may be almost exhausted; in such cases, Ling Sha Wan should be taken. If bowel movements are regular, then Lai Fu Dan may be appropriate. The two medicines are commonly used. </p>
<p>In cases of cold vomiting, the facial complexion appears swollen, sweat may be present on the forehead, and the pulse is deep, slow, and weak; cold energy stagnates in the stomach, preventing acceptance and thus leading to vomiting. Hiccups arise from excessive deficiency of stomach qi, due to overuse of purging methods, which prevent clear qi from rising and turbid qi from descending, leading to unsteady qi flow.

<p>In children during autumn and summer, many experience heat vomiting, characterized by the expulsion of yellow phlegm, a warm forehead, a feeling of heat in the five palms, and possibly infrequent and reddish urination—this is termed heat vomiting. If there is dry retching without material, it is advisable to administer Xiangru drink. </p>
<p>Heat vomiting in children arises from excessive consumption of sweet and roasted foods, or from the rich flavors of a wet nurse&#39;s diet, leading to heat accumulation in the stomach, or due to heat from the summer sun penetrating the stomach. If there are muscle spasms and symptoms of restlessness and thirst, it indicates that summer heat has harmed the stomach&#39;s energy; first, use Xiangru powder, and then bamboo shavings soup. </p>
<p>If the vomit is yellowish and the child cannot accept anything, it indicates heat in the stomach; start with a yellow purging powder, followed by ginseng stomach-soothing powder. If the expulsion is sour and foul, it is caused by food stagnation; use Baohe pills. If there is vomiting of undigested milk, it signifies weak stomach energy; administer Yigong powder. </p>
<p>If vomiting is accompanied by reduced appetite and abdominal pain with a desire for pressure, it points to spleen qi deficiency; use Liu Junzi powder with added wood fragrance. </p>
<p>Overall, it is essential to examine the fingers; if they are warm, it indicates stomach heat, while if cool, it indicates stomach cold. For heat, use yellow purging powder; for cold, use warming middle soup; if neither hot nor cold, aim to balance with Yigong powder.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chao Shi states: In spring and summer, when a child is given soup, their intestines and stomach are weak and cannot withstand medicinal effects, leading to continuous vomiting and diarrhea. The medicine steams the organs, causing distress and fatigue, resulting in poisoning from gas causing vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<h3>Injurious Milk Vomiting</h3>
<p>When an infant breastfeeds excessively, or if the child falls asleep while still nursing, there is no sense of fullness, leading to the spleen’s inability to function and the stomach’s inability to retain, causing fullness and overflow, hence inducing vomiting. If this continues, it can lead to chronic shock. Caution is advised! In this situation, it is best to regulate breastfeeding. If severe, one should temporarily stop breastfeeding, allowing the nurse to take a soothing formula and the child to take breast-milk dissolving pills to convert milk into digestible food. If vomiting occurs directly from the mouth corners, it indicates that the milk is excessive and cannot be digested, resulting in overflow; this is not a disease, and one should not rashly administer other vomiting medications. Vomiting milk that comes out directly without remaining is termed &quot;regurgitated milk.&quot; To stop it, decoct three qian of roasted barley, one qian of dried tangerine peel, and three fen of clove in water to be taken; this will stop the vomiting immediately.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the causes of diarrhea, there are various types: cold diarrhea, hot diarrhea, food-related diarrhea, watery diarrhea, accumulation diarrhea, shock diarrhea, wind diarrhea, visceral cold diarrhea, and malnutrition-induced diarrhea. Each has its own characteristics, described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Cold Diarrhea</strong>: Often characterized by clear watery stools, infrequent bowel movements, abdominal pain accompanied by sounds, a furrowed brow, slow eye movements, a pale face, sweating on the forehead, and is often treated with warming herbal drinks, a mixture of Angelica powder, ginger decoction, and remedies such as Zhong Tang, Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, Yi Zhong Gao, and Chen Xiang Bing Lang Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Diarrhea</strong>: The stool is yellow, similar to water pouring from a tube; it stops after a bout, but reappears after half a day. Symptoms include irritability, thirst, and scant yellow urine. Foods consumed are often coarse. Initial treatments include Wu Ling San or Da Shun Yin, followed by Qian’s Bai Zhu San; Xiang Ru San is also effective.</p>
<p><strong>Food-Related Diarrhea</strong>: This arises from a weak spleen and stomach, further aggravated by raw and cold fruits, causing loose stools; it may also derive from nursing mothers consuming raw, cold, and greasy foods which then adversely affect the child. Symptoms include pale lips and face, watery and less stool, sometimes with an abnormal foul smell, and yellowed thin appearance. The initial treatment focuses on warming and regulating the stomach&#39;s Qi, followed by addressing accumulations to solidify the spleen. Suitable remedies include Chōng Hé Yǐn, a mixture of Angelica powder, ginger, and dates decoction. For accumulation, larger children may take Wū Xī Wán, while smaller children might use Huà Pí Wán or Sān Lǐng Sàn; to solidify the spleen, methods include Hé Zhōng Sàn and Xǐng Pí Sàn.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Diarrhea is termed &quot;dòng xiè&quot; (洞泄), which arises from an imbalance of yin and yang, where the body&#39;s fluids are not properly separated. This results in yellow water being expelled with little urine produced, and the discharges become frequent and excessive. This typically occurs between summer and autumn when, during the day, one may shed clothing for relief from heat, and at night, the loss of coverings causes a feeling of cold. The clash of hot and cold leads to confusion of the clear and turbid. Additionally, it may stem from a nursing mother having internal heat, which transfers heat to the milk. If the child is abruptly fed, it causes a discord in the child&#39;s spleen and stomach, mixing and expelling the fluids. In this case, one might use Wuling Powder combined with Coix seeds, Plantago seeds, and Pinellia, boiled in water with ginger, to correct the imbalance of yin and yang. Alternatively, one could start with Dashun Drink, warm white soup, or Xiangru Powder to regulate and mitigate the condition. Qian&#39;s Bai Zhu Powder and Liu He Soup are also effective.</p>
<p>Accumulated diarrhea occurs due to a weakness in the spleen&#39;s qi, where milk and food enter the stomach but cannot be properly metabolized, leading to stagnation over time. If cold foods further harm the stomach, the condition may progress to diarrhea that persists without end, rendering various medicines ineffective. Since the condition remains in the spleen and stomach, it cannot be cured until the accumulation is removed. Therefore, one should first eliminate the accumulation before addressing the diarrhea itself; once the diarrhea stops and the spleen is fortified, the illness will resolve. Treatments such as Sanleng Powder and Wuxi Pill can be applied, followed by the use of Chenxiang Betel Nut Pill, Shenling Baizhu Powder, Hezhong Powder, and Xiangju Cake for recovery.</p>
<p>In cases of shock-induced diarrhea, the stool is dark green and sticky like glue, and one should not hastily stop it. Rather, the focus should be on calming the heart, soothing the liver, and harmonizing the spleen and stomach to digest the breast milk and food. The treatment involves first administering Wuling Powder, followed by Sanleng Powder, brewed with water and ginger, and served with barnyard millet.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>Regarding wind diarrhea: This occurs after a major shock or illness, with loose stools that are yellow-brown, possibly mixed with undigested food, similar to milk food. This is due to spleen deficiency. If there are dark brown stools, it relates to kidney issues, as spleen deficiency allows kidney water to overwhelm it. If one does not consume food for a long time and experiences additional shock or convulsions, one should promote kidney water flow and eliminate spleen wind, then replenish the spleen for self-healing, thus preventing recurrence. To promote kidney water, take Wǔlíngsǎn (Five-ingredient powder) with half raw and half roasted Qianniuzi, along with job’s tears in water and ginger decoction. To eliminate spleen wind, take Xièhuángsǎn (Yellow-reducing powder). To regulate spleen energy, use Shēn-líng-bái-zhú-sǎn (Ginseng, Poria and Atractylodes powder).</p>
<p>For organ cold diarrhea: The stools resemble the color of green bamboo, neither too loose nor too firm, or may present as greenish water. Before the diarrhea, there might be abdominal pain and sounds, often accompanied by crying just before defecation. This typically occurs within the first three to five months of life and does not extend beyond the first year. The initial cause stems from a short umbilical cord, with wind and cold forcing in from outside, resulting in this ailment. Initially, use a soothing drink with water and white scallion decoction to warm the center and resolve the exterior; followed by taking Dāngguīsǎn (Angelica powder), water, and roasted ginger decoction, as well as a blend of Qi regulators and Lǐzhōngtāng (Regulating the center decoction).<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cold Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Tang stated: Cold diarrhea arises from deficiency and coldness of the spleen and stomach. Water fails to transform and therefore leads to diarrhea. Qian Zhongyang said: If a child is unable to consume milk, has brown diarrhea, and feels cold with no warmth in the body, one should use a modified version of the Yi Huang San. If the stools are bluish-white, and there is no thirst or impatience, it is cold accumulation diarrhea, and should be treated with Li Zhong Tang. If one is exposed to wind-cold air through the mouth and nose, and the spleen and stomach are affected by cold food, first use Li Zhong Tang, followed by Yi Gong San. When the fire of the Mingmen is weak, it cannot warm the qi of the Middle Jiao; therefore, those with cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach should use Yi Huang San and Ba Wei Wan. For individuals with weak spleen and stomach, use Wu Wei Yi Gong San; for those with sinking spleen qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; for cold and water harming the earth, apply Yi Huang San; when liver wood overacts on the spleen, use Si Jun Chai Hu San; and for cold extremities, add Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang. The practitioner should be discerning!</p>
<p>Danxi stated: Blue diarrhea is also due to cold, and it is advisable to use Su He Xiang Wan and Ping Wei San in equal parts, mixed with honeyed water for administration. </p>
<p>Tian stated: The bluish stools are due to fright wind affecting the interior and disharmony of spleen qi; therefore, Bai Zhu Tang is appropriate.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heat Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Xue said: If the right cheek is red and the person drinks cold water, it indicates excess heat in the stomach; use the Xie Huang San. If the person dislikes cold and prefers heat, it indicates deficiency heat in the stomach; use the Bai Zhu San. If both the right cheek and forehead are red, it suggests heart and spleen heat; use Xie Huang San with fried black Huang Lian. If the left cheek and left side of the face are both red, it indicates liver fire affecting the spleen; use Si Jun Zi Tang with Chai Hu. If a child suffers from dietary injury, use Bao He Wan; nursing mothers should especially avoid rich foods and regulate their diet. If a nursing mother’s diet leads to her child’s vomiting and diarrhea, the treatment should focus on the mother. Generally, if heat appears at the onset of illness, it is due to prevailing evil qi, indicating excess; if it transforms to cold at the end, it shows true qi being depleted, indicating deficiency. Prolonged illness with heat indicates internal cold masked by false heat. Prolonged diarrhea with depletion of original qi requires reference to previous treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Food Injury Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Dong Yuan said: In cases of food injury, there is a dislike for food. For children experiencing diarrhea due to dietary issues, the spleen is harmed, and its qi cannot function properly, resulting in undigested dairy and food. If there is foul belching and sourness, with a sensation of fullness or pain in the chest and abdomen that worsens when pressed, it indicates that the stagnant matter has not yet resolved, and Bao He Wan should be used. If abdominal pain does not worsen when pressed, it indicates that the dairy and food have been digested; use Yi Gong San. If spleen qi is damaged and there is a lack of appetite, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. For injuries from cold foods or a preference for warmth, add Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang. If dairy and food have been digested and abdominal pain has stopped, but the diarrhea persists, it indicates a loss of the spleen&#39;s rising clear qi; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Qian said: When Huang Chengwu was two years old, he fell ill, suffering from poor appetite and diarrhea. Many doctors attempted to stop it, but after more than ten days, he became pale and weak, his milk and food were not digesting, his body felt cold, and he was troubled by a feeling of heaviness and drowsiness. They all believed he was in a severe state and called for Qian. </p>
<p>Qian first gave him three doses each of Yihuang Powder and Pulmonary Nourishing Powder. After three days, his body warmed up, and he no longer had the feeling of heaviness. Then, with a small amount of white rice porridge, he introduced another three doses of Spleen Nourishing Powder to stimulate recovery and stop the discomfort. </p>
<p>Why did he do this? The diarrhea stemmed from a deficiency in the spleen due to improper eating. Initially, he did not administer purgatives because of the prolonged retention. After ten days, the upper system was full while the lower was weak. A weak spleen qi draws the lungs into weakness, as they are interdependent like mother and child. By first nourishing the spleen, the lung condition naturally recedes, which is why his body warmed up and the heaviness disappeared. Then, only did he address the cause of his injury.</p>
<p>Someone asked: Why not purge first and then nourish? He replied: The paleness indicates the lower organs are cold. If we purged first, it would lead to significant weakness. Now, by first fortifying the spleen and then purging, there would be no weakness. After this, he provided further nourishment, which ultimately restored his well-being.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Shock-related Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang states: After a shock, one may experience vomiting and diarrhea due to a weakened stomach, or a deficiency of qi due to emotional distress. If the sclera appears pale and the stool is greenish-yellow, this diarrhea requires warming and supplementation; use the Sacred Life Preservation Pill or the Diaoteng Decoction for treatment. If milk is accompanied by diarrhea, use the Milk Dissolving Pill or Food Intake Pill. For mild thirst, heart and spleen symptoms manifesting as irritability and fever, this type of diarrhea is particularly difficult to treat; use the Cinnabar and Five Poria Powder. In cases of severe cold, the Definitive Life-preserving Decoction should be used. Later, administer the Warm Shock Red Monarch Powder or the Sleeping Shock Celestial Medicine.</p>
<p>For children with shock-related diarrhea, the liver governs emotional distress. When the liver is excessive, it must transmit to the spleen. When the spleen is weakened, it fails to properly digest food, resulting in unregulated water passage, hence the greenish color of the diarrhea. If there are also convulsions, the green color indicates liver issues and convulsions indicate liver symptoms. There are also cases where the lactating mother suffers from spleen deficiency due to shock, leading to anger and liver fire. The treatise states: anger causes qi to rebel; if severe, it results in vomiting blood and food-related diarrhea. Thus, the method should focus on soothing the liver and supplementing the spleen; one must be cautious not to use harsh purgatives. If the spleen qi becomes increasingly deficient and liver evils worsen, serious cases involving convulsions and rigidity also signify intense liver fire and exhaustion of the Central Qi.</p>
<p>Whenever signs of shock are observed, one should only use formulas like Four Sovereigns, Six Sovereigns, or Yi Gong Powder, adding White Aconite to stabilize the wind, and Chaihu to soothe the liver, thus addressing issues at the root to prevent diarrhea and convulsions ensuring restoration of calm. If symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions have already been seen, yet one is still unaware of the necessity to reinforce the spleen and soothe the liver as a means of life preservation—using formulas like Bao Long or Zhen Jing—such knowledge indeed remains quite distant.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Sudden Diarrhea</h3>
<p>The Cai family states: When a child has sudden diarrhea, it is due to the weakness of the intestines and stomach, harmed by the sudden invasion of hot and cold air.

The &quot;Classics of Phoenix Essence&quot; sings: In the spleen, there is stagnant heat causing persistent diarrhea throughout the year. The neck is soft and many people experience choking sensation, along with clear fluid flowing from the nose. At times, there is a golden-yellow appearance; if there is also prolapsed intestine, it will not retract. For physical manifestations, observe the chest and diaphragm; the chest is deeply red with sweat resembling oil. The lips are red, sores appear, and the eyes have a red pulse; if the spleen is not regulated, it may lead to death.</p>
<h3>Food-related Diarrhea</h3>
<p>Medical texts refer to this as dietary diarrhea. Food does not digest, and the spleen and stomach are cold, hence they cannot assimilate properly. It is necessary to tonify the spleen, using &quot;Yihuang San&quot; as the main treatment. If there is undigested milk food, the initial illness arises suddenly with cold air released, and the limbs are also cold. The face is pale and lacks luster, with unstable spirit; this indicates disharmony of stomach qi, which can be treated with warming medicines like &quot;Junzi Pill&quot; and &quot;Yihuang San&quot; as the main treatment. If the illness persists over a long time without recovery and milk food does not digest, there is wind-cold in the spleen and stomach. First take &quot;Yihuang San&quot; twice, then follow with &quot;Xuanfeng San&quot; to guide it out. The stomach needs further tonification, and it is advisable to refer to major prescriptions for dietary diarrhea.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Pediatric Hygiene: Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>The vomiting and diarrhea in children stem from a weakness of the spleen and stomach, irregularities in breastfeeding, and external influences such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness interfering with the body&#39;s proper functions. The symptoms vary, and are described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Vomiting from birth: If a child vomits immediately after birth, it is due to residual foul blood in the mouth being swallowed into the throat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vomiting and retching, with fullness in the chest and rapid breathing: This occurs when the infant cries excessively and breathes irregularly, and the mother abruptly feeds them milk. When the child still has reversed airflow, it prevents the milk from going down, causing it to stagnate in the chest, leading to vomiting as the milk follows the reversed air. It is advisable to regulate the airflow to stop the vomiting. Ancient texts also mention that crying excessively before feeding often leads to vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vomiting with abdominal distension, wheezing, undigested milk, mixed with greenish water, and a pale complexion: This is caused by the breastfeeding mother&#39;s stomach being cold and consuming cold food and drinks, which introduces cold energy into the milk, spoiling its quality and not being eliminated before feeding the child. Alternatively, if the mother feeds the child with cold items, the cold milk and food will clash with the air in the stomach, harming the spleen and stomach, leading to reversed airflow. In such cases, it is advisable to warm the stomach to stop the vomiting and regulate the airflow.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is significant injury with stagnation, one should use stabilizing medicine to alleviate it; do not rush to take action, for fear that the spleen and stomach may become more deficient and generate wind. For all milk that has turned bad due to wind and cold, it should be squeezed out, and the breastfeeding child should be temporarily weaned. The wet nurse should take medicine to warm her abdomen before feeding the child again. If the milk is not squeezed out, it not only causes the child to vomit but can also allow cold to enter the already deficient stomach and intestines, leading to diarrhea.</p>
<p>For vomiting, fever, and curdled milk, there is heat in the stomach. This may be due to the milk being overheated, or from consuming alcohol, which heats the milk, spoiling its quality, and if not squeezed out, it continues to be fed to the child. Alternatively, if the child nurses while hot, the heat can enter the stomach, battling with vital energy and causing a reverse reaction, leading to vomiting. If the symptoms are like this, and there has been a buildup of heat for a long time, sores will likely develop on the limbs, accompanied by excessive thirst and a yellowish complexion; gentle purgation is advisable. In the case of deficiency, use stabilizing medicine to alleviate it, then regulate the vital energy.</p>
<p>For vomiting, fever, cyanotic nose, yawning, restlessness, and hot breath at night, this is due to a cold invasion causing vomiting. This occurs due to improper release, where cold wind attacks the blood and energy, hence the fever, yawning, and restlessness with hot breath. If the energy cannot flow smoothly, this results in a reverse reaction and vomiting.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the past, when Qian Yi treated the four-year-old son of Duan Zhai, the boy had a fever, was coughing up phlegm, and had coughed up blood for several days. Other doctors used Platycodon Decoction and Stephania Powder but had no success. The boy continued to cough, with phlegm rising, and could not stop wheezing. Thus, they requested Yi to treat him. He prescribed a large dose of an emetic and also used Lung Nourishing Decoction and Spleen Strengthening Powder as treatment. Yi stated: This child is coughing up blood due to lung deficiency. Although he coughs up blood, it is because of heat. Over time, it can lead to weakness. Currently, the phlegm is rising, and he is vomiting; we need to expel that phlegm. If he does not vomit the phlegm, it will not be very beneficial, as expelling the phlegm can weaken him and also cause panic. When the phlegm is obstructing upward, it can also lead to convulsions. Therefore, it is appropriate to first resolve the phlegm and then nourish the spleen and lungs; it is vital to expel the phlegm for a proper treatment. If we first nourish the lungs, it would be contrary to the approach. The medicinal formula used by Yi is recorded in the collection; this is what is meant by understanding the priorities in treating diseases.</p>
<p>The terms &quot;retching&quot; and &quot;vomiting&quot; differ. Vomiting occurs when evil forces obstruct the stomach Qi, causing it to reverse and rise, preventing the transformation and movement of food, thus being expelled with the Qi. Retching, on the other hand, is merely the Qi reversing and the desire to vomit, but if vomiting occurs, food will not be expelled, hence it is commonly referred to as dry heaving. Retching can also happen when a child sucks too much milk, causing the stomach to overflow, which is commonly termed &quot;milk overflow.&quot; To remedy this, it is best to let the child suck an empty breast immediately. However, if they continue to suck frequently for a long time, it can also lead to illness.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Diarrhea that is white in color is considered cold diarrhea. This occurs when a child&#39;s stomach and intestines are weak, leading to an expulsion of wind and cold, or due to consuming cold foods and drinks that enter the stomach and intestines, causing coldness to clash and result in diarrhea. If the stool is white and accompanied by a pale face or abdominal pain, one should harmonize the middle. If there is also an injury from wind and cold, with repeated bouts, and if the cold is severe, then diarrhea may become persistent and lead to a more serious condition.</p>
<p>Diarrhea that is red in color is considered hot diarrhea. This happens when a child’s stomach and intestines are originally accompanied by excessive heat, and wind and cold invade, conflicting and leading to diarrhea, which is why it appears red. In this case, it is advisable to mildly purge to guide out the heat and then regulate the qi.</p>
<p>Diarrhea that alternates between red and white, or is watery or contains grains, is known as mixed cold and hot diarrhea. This occurs when a child’s stomach and intestines have first experienced cold and then suffered from heat, or vice versa. With underlying weakness, the alternating effects of cold and heat cause diarrhea, thus one should adjust the balance of hot and cold and nourish the qi.</p>
<p>Diarrhea with colors of yellow, red, or black, all indicate heat. Red and black indicate toxicity, so one should mildly purge and then regulate the qi.</p>
<p>Diarrhea appearing green and accompanied by fever, or sometimes unrest during sleep, indicates shock-induced diarrhea. A child&#39;s stool is yellow, which is the natural color related to the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

Otherwise, it may transform into spleen wind and provoke epilepsy, making it difficult to cure. The so-called green stool must be a quick and immediate response; the stool appearing blue is thus. If initially yellow and then later blue, it is not considered so. Children generally appear so; it should not be regarded as green stool. If diarrhea is a bluish white color, and food is not digested, it is called cold. Warmly tonify the spleen and stomach to dispel wind and cold.</p>
<p>If diarrhea is reddish and white, with a distended abdomen and visible blue veins, producing watery stools accompanied by crying, or if consuming soil and worms present intermittently, this indicates malabsorption diarrhea. It should be treated to stop the diarrhea and resolve malabsorption. </p>
<p>If diarrhea lasts several days, and the lips, mouth, and stool are all white, and there is considerable stool, this indicates chronic cold, with weakened spleen and stomach, risking a transformation to spleen wind causing epilepsy.

<p>Diarrhea occurring during a hot season is often due to heat and cold food. It is not harmed by heat but rather by cold. If heat injures and causes diarrhea, then there will be irritability and heat in the heart, and urination will be obstructed, with the distinction between clear and turbid lost. Diarrhea of a red-yellow color suggests promoting urination to alleviate summer heat. If urination occurs frequently with diarrhea, it indicates cold diarrhea, which is typically bluish white, with undigested food.

<p>When affected by wind cold and experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, the body temperature fluctuates between hot and cold, accompanied by yawning, restlessness, excessive sleep, coarse breathing, and possible previous purging or absence of symptoms. It is crucial not to purge again. This condition arises from the spleen and lungs being chilled, hindering their function. There may be symptoms affecting the five internal organs. For those with a dispersing nature, use Da Qing Paste; for those who need to tonify the spleen, follow with Yi Huang Powder. These are the medications used by Qian Yi.</p>
<p>When experiencing wind cold, vomiting, diarrhea, with fever and excessive sleep, the ability to nurse, yawning, restlessness, hot breath, continuous thirst, phlegm vomiting, and yellow water in the stools, this indicates stomach heat and thirst from deficiency. One should generate body fluids to quench thirst. Qian Yi suggests taking a decoction of Bai Zhu and then dispersing the wind cold, also using Da Qing Paste. Additionally, if a person has symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea with drowsiness and visibly opened eyes, this indicates stomach heat; if they are drowsy without visible eye exposure, it indicates excess stomach heat.</p>
<p>In cases of wind cold, with coolness, frothy saliva, diarrhea that is light blue or white, yawning, restlessness without thirst, difficult breathing, prolonged exhalation, and drowsiness with opened eyes, this is a light and timid presentation of wind cold leading to vomiting and diarrhea, where one should first tonify the spleen.

<p>Vomiting and diarrhea with undigested milk and food, accompanied by a sour and foul odor, indicate an injury from food.

<p>If vomiting and diarrhea occur within the first three days of birth, accompanied by strong heat and lack of appetite for milk, or with undigested white stools, this signifies a milk injury.

<p>If vomiting and diarrhea persist from three days up to ten days after birth, with body heat that feels cool, lack of desire for milk, blue or white stools, and undigested milk, this indicates a condition of excess above and deficiency below.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cold and Hot Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea occurring after mid-May with a strong fever is associated with heat in the body. In this case, the internal organs of a child have nine parts heat and one part cold. This is due to overconsumption of hot milk or heat entering the stomach, causing the milk to not digest, resulting in deep red diarrhea. It is advisable to use medication to clear the heat, as suggested by Qian Yi, who recommended the use of Yu Lu San.</p>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea occurring after mid-June with significant warmth that resembles heat indicates that there is six parts heat and four parts cold in the internal organs. There may be vomiting of undigested milk or food, and the diarrhea appears yellow with more white and a semblance of brown; this might occur regardless of whether milk is ingested or not. It is advisable to slightly nourish the spleen and emphasize clearing heat, as Qian Yi suggested using a lesser amount of Yi Huang San and more of Yu Lu San. Additionally, careful observation of the balance of heat and cold is necessary. If a child has intense heat with red or yellow diarrhea, this indicates excessive heat, and treatment should follow the protocols of after mid-May.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One should not consume milk, as it resembles sleep; it causes stuffiness, turmoil, and a feeling of blocked energy, along with prolonged breath, sleepiness with opened eyes, pale lips, and a tendency to sip frequently without thirst. Qian Yi suggests taking a lot of Supplementing the Spleen and Nourishing the Yellow Powder before meals, and only a little of the Cooling Jade Dew Powder after meals. It is essential to observe the changes in temperature; if the body feels too warm and there is yellow diarrhea after purging, one should treat it based on what&#39;s customary after mid-June. </p>
<p>For vomiting and diarrhea that occur after mid-August, if the body feels cold and lacks yang, one should not consume milk, and if there is dry cough and greenish-brown watery diarrhea, Qian Yi advises using only the Nourishing Yellow Powder to supplement the spleen and not to purge. </p>
<p>The discussions of heat and cold based on time and month pertain to the Central Plains; however, compared to Jiangzhou and Zhejiang, the climate is different. The regions of Jiangzhou and Zhejiang remain chilly in February and March, warm in April and May, and only heat up after entering the summer solstice in June. July is hot, and August&#39;s heat has not yet receded. Even during winter, many sunny days feel warm, while many cloudy summer days feel cold; thus, one cannot strictly apply the seasonal temperatures of the Central Plains as a universal conclusion. </p>
<p>The texts mention differences based on geography, with variations in warmth and coolness. Furthermore, each year&#39;s heat and cold follow the seasons&#39; cycles, making it difficult to strictly define specific days or months. One should observe the conditions as they arise: treat heat with heat, warmth with warmth, and cold with cold.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

Diarrhea and vomiting during the heat of summer and autumn, where summer heat harms cold, lead to agitation of the heart, difficulty in urination, confusion between clear and turbid, and the disruption of yin and yang, are referred to as &quot;qi disturbance.&quot; Disturbance between the stomach and intestines is termed &quot;cholera.&quot; Symptoms arise from heat injuring cold, causing qi to reverse, resulting in cough, abdominal and flank fullness, elevated body temperature, disordered pulse, headaches, and body aches, resembling the signs of a cold; the upper part manifests as severe vomiting, the lower as severe diarrhea; in severe cases, the limbs may become cold and cramps occur in the legs. The method should regulate the qi, distinguish between clear and turbid, and manage the rise and fall of yin and yang. If symptoms are solely due to summer heat causing vomiting and diarrhea, there will be difficulty in urination, though the symptoms may resemble the previous ones but are milder and not comparable to cholera. The diarrhea will appear reddish-yellow; this condition is simply termed &quot;summer heat vomiting and diarrhea,&quot; not cholera.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat cholera characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, if there is excessive heat and thirst, use Wuling Powder; if there is excessive cold without thirst, accompanied by pain in the heart and abdomen and restlessness with an inability to drink, one may take Lizhong Decoction; if there is severe cold with abdominal pain and cramping, and the limbs are tense, add Aconite to Lizhong Decoction; if sweating occurs with a feeling of cold, with cold hands and feet, diarrhea with clear stools, internal cold and external heat, and the pulse is feeble and about to cease, use Sini Decoction. For the aforementioned diseases, one may take Xiangru Powder, as other medicines cannot treat these conditions. </p>

<p>Regardless of the timing of vomiting and diarrhea, it indicates weakness of the spleen and stomach, often leading to wind arising as &quot;spleen wind&quot; causing prolonged distress.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomiting and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In cases of children experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, there may be heat, cold, deficiency, accumulation, or fright; however, many cases arise from harm done by the wet nurse. Generally, if the fingertips are warm, it indicates heat in the stomach; if cold, it indicates cold in the stomach. If there is abdominal pain that the child wants to press, it belongs to deficiency; if it cannot be pressed, it belongs to excess. </p>
<p>In cold cases, the child’s energy is warm, the spirit clear, the face pale, and the limbs cold; there is vomiting without digestion, and the stool is blue-white. This requires the use of &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; or &quot;Yi Gong San&quot; with the addition of mint, peach kernel, and cardamom. </p>
<p>In heat cases, upon consuming milk, the child vomits; the limbs and palms are agitated and hot, the lips are red and thirsty, the stool is yellowish-brown, and there is scant, red urine. For this, add wood lotus and talc to &quot;Xie Huang San.&quot; </p>
<p>For cases of heatstroke, &quot;Huo Xiang Yin&quot; or &quot;Wu Ling San&quot; is appropriate. For those harmed by milk or food, there is drowsiness with belching, a lack of interest in milk or food, a hot belly, and cold feet; the vomit is sour and foul, the diarrhea resembles rotting eggs, and the abdomen cannot be pressed. Treatment should be with &quot;Bao He Wan&quot; or &quot;Ping Wei San&quot; with the addition of malt, Pinellia ternata, and clove. </p>
<p>For cases of wind harm, the child alternates between warmth and cold, coughs with shortness of breath; use &quot;Tian Ma San&quot; with the addition of angelica and lignum sappan. </p>
<p>In deficiency cases, if they sleep with open eyes, vomit without digestion, have unchanged stools, are lethargic and crave milk, with cold hands and fingers, pain in the abdomen that they like to press; employ &quot;Yi Gong San,&quot; &quot;Bai Zhu San,&quot; and &quot;Support the Stomach Paste.&quot; </p>
<p>For fright cases, the complexion is blue-yellow, food does not digest, diarrhea is blue-green; &quot;Liu Jun Zi Tang&quot; with the addition of bupleurum, smartweed, and aromatic wood is indicated. </p>
<p>In general, if vomiting occurs before diarrhea, it mostly relates to heat; if diarrhea occurs before vomiting, it typically indicates deficiency. If there is only vomiting without diarrhea, or only diarrhea without vomiting, one should treat from the pulse in the major diagnosis while also addressing the root cause of the illness with medicine, and not just focus on the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

<p>Grind into powder, taking 1-2 qian mixed with warm clear soup. The &quot;Complete Book of Pediatrics&quot; states this is a key medicine for balancing yin and yang. Xue Ji said: If fluids are excessively seeping into the large intestine, causing diarrhea with little urination, this medicine is appropriate for unblocking. If yin and yang have been separated but urination is still scarce, this is due to spleen and lung qi deficiency affecting water generation, and it is advisable to use the Qi-boosting Decoction with added Mai Dong and Schisandra. If there is deficiency fire rising, causing reddish and scanty urination, this indicates lung qi damage and an inability to produce water, and one should use the Rehmannia Pill with added Mai Dong and Schisandra.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

Xue Ji states: If the patient maintains a normal diet but experiences thirst for cold drinks, it indicates excessive heat in the stomach channel; this medicine is appropriate. If the patient eats little, feels fatigued, or has yellow diarrhea, it indicates spleen deficiency and requires the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chaihu and Shengma added. If the diarrhea turns green, accompanied by abdominal distention or irritability, this suggests spleen deficiency being overrun by the liver; it is advisable to use the previous decoction with additional muxiang.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Scented Mugwort Drink</strong>: It treats the imbalance of yin and yang, the interference of clear and turbid, and the qi obstructing the middle burner, known as cholera. This is all due to overindulgence in rich foods like pork and additionally consuming dairy products, eating a variety of foods from land and sea without restraint, excessive intake of cold drinks, sleeping on cold bedding, and the chilling winds causing damage to the spleen and stomach. All food gets stuck and cannot be digested, leading to stagnation of the two energies of yin and yang, where yang qi wants to descend and yin qi wants to ascend, intertwining and resulting in continuous vomiting and diarrhea, confusion in the organs, and both nutrient and protective energies being depleted. Cold invades the muscles, causing cramps. It is advisable to take this remedy, which has significant efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Recipe</strong>: Use one tael each of thick bark, ginger juice, sautéed scented mugwort, and white hyacinth bean, stir-fried until golden. Grind them together and take three qian with one cup of water and half a cup of wine, simmer until reduced to seven parts, strain, and use freshly drawn water to rinse repeatedly, making it extremely cold, then take it at once; the colder the medicine, the quicker the effect. When boiling, do not use iron utensils, and simmer slowly.</p>
<p>It also treats atypical vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain, great thirst, irritability, cold extremities, excessive sweating, and unbearable cramping in the feet. One should immerse it in well water until extremely cold before taking, for it possesses remarkable efficacy. For treating dysentery, add Huang Lian (Coptis); for cholera with vomiting and diarrhea due to summer heat, add Chuan Xiong (Szechuan lovage root) and Bai Zhu (white atractylodes).<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

<p>&quot;The Comprehensive Medical Text&quot; states: For children who vomit breast milk, moxibustion should be applied to the Zhongting point, located one inch below the Xuanji point.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>Qian Yi in &quot;Children&#39;s Direct Principle&quot; states: A certain official, the Grand Marshall, is suffering from persistent vomiting and diarrhea with undigested grains. Various physicians used warming herbs but after one day, the condition worsened with irregular vomiting and shortness of breath. Qian argued that it should be treated with cooling herbs, as the heat was internal. He prescribed three doses of gypsum decoction all at once. Others said the vomiting and diarrhea were severe and the grains were not digesting, so they recommended tonifying the spleen and questioned the use of cooling herbs. Wang Xin and many other physicians used a spleen-tonifying mixture of clove powder, giving three doses. When Qian arrived later, he said that this was inappropriate. He predicted that after three days, the patient would experience abdominal fullness and a rise in body heat with water-induced vomiting. After three days, this indeed occurred. The reasoning was that during June, internal heat was intense and when it penetrated the abdomen, it caused harm to the spleen and stomach, resulting in severe vomiting and diarrhea. The others then continued using warming herbs, further heating the upper body, leading to shortness of breath and an increased urge to drink, which would worsen after three days. Unable to resolve the issue, the physicians called Qian again. Upon observing the signs of heat, he prescribed three doses of Bai Hu decoction and additionally administered Bai Bingzi. On the first day, he reduced the dosage by two fen, on the second and third days he provided two doses of Bai Hu decoction, and on the fourth day, he used one dose of gypsum decoction. He combined Lian Dong, Huang Qing, Nao Zi, Niu Huang, Tian Zhu Huang, and Fu Ling, coated with Zhu Sha, and used five pills dissolved in bamboo leaf decoction. This reduced the heat and stabilized the patient.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the Guangqin Palace, the seventh Grand Commandant, aged seven, suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. It was July at the time, and the symptoms included lack of appetite, faintness, disturbed sleep, choking sensations, and retching. The bowel movements were infrequent, and there was no thirst. Various doctors treated it as a case of shock, suspecting it was due to the sleep. Qian said: &quot;First nourish the spleen, then clear the heat.&quot; He prescribed Shijunzi pills to nourish the spleen and gypsum decoction to clear the heat; he also ground mercury and sulfur into a powder, mixed it, and adjusted it with ginger water for administration. Qian commented: &quot;In cases of vomiting and diarrhea, within five days, nine parts should be purged and one part nourished; within eight days, nine parts should be nourished and one part purged.&quot; He stated that this was due to a deficiency in the spleen causing diarrhea, and if the physician treated it incorrectly, it could result in death from excessive purging. Therefore, it was necessary to nourish the spleen. If using Shijunzi pills was too slow, then it must also include warming the stomach and strengthening the spleen. A physician named Li asked: &quot;What caused the vomiting?&quot; Qian responded: &quot;A deficiency in the spleen and a lack of fluids leads to reverse qi.&quot; Li asked: &quot;What caused the diarrhea of greenish-brown water?&quot; Qian replied: &quot;The intestines and stomach are extremely deficient, leading to severe cold.&quot; Qian treated the condition, and the patient recovered.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At five years old, Feng Chengwu&#39;s child suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhea, with high fever, lack of desire for food, and prominent whites of the eyes, looking lifeless. The teacher said: &quot;This indicates weakness in the kidney meridian; if purged, it will only worsen the deficiency.&quot; Therefore, he ground up a digestive pill for treatment, and the child gradually recovered. In general, if food is not expelled, it leads to accumulation; after purging, then give supplements to the spleen, and efficacy is assured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Door on Caring for Parents&quot; states: Liu Guangji&#39;s son from Hejian fell ill with sores at just two years of age, later experiencing vomiting and confusion. Treatments using cloves and cardamom were ineffective. Master Ma sent to his home and said to Guangji: &quot;Now there is a small formula, non-toxic, known by all. Will you accept it?&quot; Guangji replied: &quot;Surely, your words must have merit; how dare I refuse!&quot; Master Ma continued: &quot;Liu Hejian often says that Liangge Powder can treat sores; Zhang Dairen used it with miraculous results. Moreover, the Inner Canon states that minor yang leads to vomiting—minor yang is heat, not cold.&quot; Guangji was delighted and agreed. On that day, Li Erxing came in from outside, heard about the effectiveness, and remarked: &quot;Sores and blisters should not be purged at the onset.&quot; Master Ma regretted his excessive words, but since it had already been done, waited patiently. As mealtime approached, the child expelled a significant amount of yellow phlegm, and by noon, when asked, the child had already gone out to play in the streets.</p>
<p>The &quot;Baoying Jinjinglu&quot; states: A five-year-old child, after eating zongzi, began to grind his teeth and wanted to vomit. Soon, he experienced abdominal distension and confusion, with a bluish yellow complexion. This indicated damage to the spleen and earth element, affecting the heart and liver, resulting in food accumulation causing convulsions. First, the child was given chicken feather to induce vomiting of sour substances, and he quickly regained consciousness. His diet was adjusted, and recovery occurred without the need for medicine.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A small child experiences vomiting and diarrhea, anxiety, fatigue, and abdominal distension, indicating a deficiency of heart fire and weakness of the spleen. Treatment involves using Six Gentlemen Decoction, Fu Shen, and Suan Zao Ren to achieve recovery, followed by a secret-recipe spleen-preserving soup to ensure healing.</p>
<p>Another child presents with vomiting and diarrhea, convulsions, and a stiff neck, suggesting spleen damage and liver insult, with deficiency of vital energy and excess of pathogenic qi. The treatment includes Yi Gong San combined with Diaoteng Geng to tonify the spleen and calm the liver, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, yawning, distress, silence, and light sensitivity indicates a failure of the spleen and lungs to nourish the liver and kidneys. The treatment employs Yi Gong San to strengthen the spleen and lungs, and Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In a case of a child with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension who refuses milk, there is damage to the spleen and stomach. Initially, Xiang Sha to aid in digestion is administered to improve appetite, followed by the Six Gentlemen Decoction to enhance spleen and stomach function.</p>
<p>A child with alternating chills and fever, vomiting, and refusal of food will cry when the abdomen is pressed, indicating stagnation of food. Initial treatment with Da An Wan helps to stabilize the condition. If there is twitching of the lips and eyes and thin yellow stools, this suggests expulsion of the pathogenic factor and weakness of spleen qi, warranting the use of Six Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the spleen and Diaoteng Geng to soothe the liver, resulting in full recovery.</p>
<p>For a child under one year old, with shortness of breath, rapid breathing, reduced intake of milk and food, and occasional vomiting, this indicates spleen damage and food stagnation. Initial treatment with Six Gentlemen Decoction, Hawthorn, and Zhi Shi gradually improves the condition. If vomiting and diarrhea persist with thirst, use Wei Ling Gao to treat vomiting and diarrhea, and Bai Zhu San to generate spleen qi and stabilize the condition.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A four-year-old child, after having irregular meals or being startled, would vomit, have diarrhea, and experience convulsions. After taking calming and phlegm-resolving medicine, the condition worsened. He was unable to eat, and medication or food would immediately induce vomiting. I used only white atractylodes, fried it yellow with soil, and boiled it with rice wash into a strong decoction, administering half a spoon at intervals. The next day, there was slight vomiting; after another day, there was no vomiting. Gradually, I increased to half a cup, and after a month, he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child stopped eating, had vomiting and diarrhea, with fever and thirst, and experienced red and white stools, sometimes greenish-yellow. After taking Xianglian pill, his condition worsened, and his hands and feet turned cold. I believed this to be due to an initial excess and a subsequent deficiency, so I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding aurantium and rattan. He recovered.</p>
<p>A child with food poisoning had vomiting and diarrhea, with loose stools that were sometimes greenish-black, while sleeping with his eyes half-open and cold hands and feet. His forehead was dark and lips bluish. This indicated weakness of the middle qi and cold water harming the earth. I employed the Wu Wei Yi Gong Powder, adding shengma, chaihu, wood fragrance, and fuzi. He recovered. Later, when vomiting and diarrhea persisted, I first used Wei Ling Powder and then Yi Gong Powder for stabilization.</p>
<p>A child with cold and heat, experiencing vomiting or diarrhea of a greenish color, led me to believe it was due to spleen deficiency and liver wood invading. I treated him with the Liu Jun Decoction, chaihu, and shengma, and he recovered. Later, due to fright and cold heat, the condition worsened during the early morning hours, with frequent urination that persisted. This indicated liver fire and blood deficiency. I first administered Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with white atractylodes, poria, and two doses of angelica to stop the symptoms, then used Rehmannia Pill for recovery.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A small child had white eyes and pale lips, with a loss of appetite and vomiting during the seventh month, accompanied by fatigue and fright. After long treatment without improvement, I noted that the fright was due to a deficiency of heart blood, and the fatigue resulted from weak qi, both caused by a deficiency in the spleen and kidneys. I used the Decoction for Tonifying the Middle and Augmenting Qi along with the Six-Flavor Pill, adding deer antler, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another small child had diarrhea with greenish-white stools, cold hands, and a pale face, occasionally experiencing food regurgitation.

<p>A small child presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea, suffering from undigested food and a heavy feeling in the lower abdomen.

<p>A small child suffered from diarrhea and abdominal pain, with cold extremities, pale lips, and darkened forehead. I determined that cold water was harming the earth element and used the Benefit Yellow Powder to relieve pain; upon recurrence, I then prescribed the Six Gentlemen, dry ginger, and phragmites, which provided immediate relief. Eventually, using the Ginseng and Regulating Decoction, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A small child experienced prolonged diarrhea combined with rectal prolapse, heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, swollen limbs, and a dull yellow complexion, occasionally turning pale. Any medicine given resulted in vomiting. Upon examining the mother, I found her to be depressed and injuring her spleen, which led to the child&#39;s poor digestion. I first treated the mother with the Decoction for Tonifying the Middle and Augmenting Qi, the Five-Flavors Special Function Powder, and the Four Spirits Pill.

I used a modified Wuwai Yigong powder with added mu xiang, and both mother and child took it, leading to recovery. Later, the child experienced convulsions, with twitching of the lips and mouth. I used the modified powder again, adding mu xiang and diao teng gou to tonify the spleen and pacify the liver, resulting in healing.</p>
<p>Another young child had diarrhea, with convulsions in the hands and feet, phlegm rising, cold hands and feet, a dark forehead, and blue lips. I used the modified Wuwai Yigong powder with added mu xiang and fried ginger to tonify the heart fire and rescue the spleen soil, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child suffered from diarrhea, with a sensation of heaviness in the lower abdomen and reduced appetite. Initially, I administered six gentleman&#39;s decoction with four spirit pills over several doses, which gradually alleviated the diarrhea and allowed for slight food intake. I then used a few doses of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction, and the heaviness in the abdomen gradually improved. Later, due to overexertion, the child developed a fever starting from the navel, which intensified with hunger. I treated it with six gentleman&#39;s decoction and fried ginger to provide some relief. Subsequently, I applied Gui Pi and Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoctions, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>In summer, a young child ate zongzi, which harmed the stomach, leading to vomiting and abdominal pain. I used Bao He pills, which seemed mild to him, so I prescribed a stronger dose. Vomiting and diarrhea occurred together, worsening the abdominal pain, but pressing on the abdomen did not elicit pain. I concluded that the food had been digested, leaving the spleen and stomach weak, indicating a need for warming and tonification. I continued with digestive aids; however, the child became drowsy and had convulsions. I employed the modified powder with added mu xiang, which gradually improved the condition. Later, after sustaining another dietary injury, I used another formulation to remove accumulation. With vomiting and diarrhea, lack of appetite, cold hands and feet, and sleeping while keeping the eyes open, the condition transformed into malaria.

I prescribed Ershen Pills, but the patient did not believe it and continued with the previous medication. The child became emaciated and sought further treatment. I then used Sishen and Liuwelweih Pills, and soon the child recovered. After stopping the medicine for a few days, the child’s appetite gradually diminished, and the diarrhea recurred. At seventeen, after marriage, the diarrhea and thirst suddenly appeared again. I used the previous medication but it was ineffective, so I prescribed Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Bawei Pills, and the child began to recover.</p>
<p>Another young child, having been deprived of food due to maternal anger, suffered from diarrhea and, after taking laxatives, began to vomit milk. Initially, I prescribed Stomach Nourishing Decoction with a small amount of roasted black Huanglian, three fen of Wuzhuyu, and four fen of Muxiang for the mother, and the child was given a spoonful or two which completely cured them. Later, the mother suffered from food injury and had blood dysentery with abdominal pain, and the child experienced the same condition. I treated them both with Sijun Decoction enhanced with the previous three ingredients. Confused by others&#39; advice, I allowed only the mother to take the treatment while the child received a different medicine for dysentery.

I used Wuwei Yigong Powder with added Muxiang, roasted Ginger, and Luoluo for both mother and child, and they recovered together.</p>
<p>A young child suffered from diarrhea, felt hot, and was very thirsty; the foul-smelling diarrhea indicated internal heat. I administered Xianglian Pills and the condition improved.

The five-ingredients powder added with cardamom was used first, and symptoms gradually receded over a period of ten days. Then, the five-flavored formula was used as the main treatment, supplemented with the kidney-boosting pill, and after several days, both urination and defecation normalized, food intake increased gradually, swelling subsided, and recovery was achieved by regulating with the formula.</p>
<p>A thirteen-year-old child suffered from diarrhea due to food injury, showing signs of an enlarged chest and abdomen, with cold hands and feet. I suggested tonifying the central qi, but this was met with disbelief. Later, while sleeping, the child had open eyes and twitching lips, at which point six-gentlemen decoction, cardamom, and hook vine were used; twitching ceased after four doses. Two more doses allowed for increased food intake. The five-flavored formula combined with somniferous herb and bupleurum was used, alleviating the distention and achieving recovery.</p>
<p>A child had prolonged diarrhea due to fright, showing a sallow complexion. I diagnosed that liver wood overcomes spleen earth. In the morning, a formula to tonify the middle and benefit qi was administered, and in the evening, the five-flavored formula with cardamom was given; both the child and mother took it and recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had diarrhea with fright and twitching, while the mother presented with a pale complexion and a tense pulse. Initially, a small chaihu decoction with cardamom and reed was given; next, four-gentlemen decoction with cardamom, hook vine, and gardenia was used, and both mother and child recovered together.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young boy was suffering from diarrhea due to his mother&#39;s shock, and the medication he took harmed his stomach, causing him to vomit milk. I used Wuwei Yigong San, roasted black Huanglian, and rice aroma to treat his mother, administering one or two spoonfuls at a time, and they both recovered. Later, the mother, due to anger and emotional distress, stopped eating and experienced diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Her son became lethargic and stopped eating, so I prescribed Liujunzi decoction with Cheqianzi, Huanglian, and Muxiang. Both mother and son took the medicine and felt better.</p>
<p>A young child had been experiencing prolonged greenish diarrhea, with gurgling in the intestines and coldness. I said: &quot;This is shock-induced diarrhea.&quot; With the spleen weakened, the liver becomes aggressive, so we must warm the spleen and calm the liver before recovery is possible. Initially, they thought it was a simple case and used medicines for shock without success, leading to abdominal distension, heaviness, difficulty urinating, and swelling in the limbs. They then began to believe my earlier words and repeatedly sought treatment. I first used Wuwei Yigong San adding Shengma and Chaihu for several doses, alleviating some symptoms. Then I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for a few doses, slightly improving appetite. However, due to food injury combined with shock, he experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and spasms, necessitating another round of Yigong San with additional Chaihu and Diaotenggou for four doses, leading to further symptom relief.</p>
<p>Yet, he also caught a cold, leading to cough, abdominal distension, and diarrhea. Some would use formulas to disperse and relieve these symptoms, but the child experienced cold extremities and spasms during sleep. I noted that this was due to the spleen being weak and the lung suffering, severely injuring the vital energy. I used Yigong San with Zisuan for one dose to disperse the exterior evil, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Fuling and Banxia to adjust and replenish the vital energy, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>

Initially treated with Six Gentleman, Saussurea, and Bupleurum, there was slight improvement. Later, after using the Wumei Yigong San, the child fully recovered. Afterwards, due to severe phlegm caused by fright, a calming and phlegm-transforming medicine was administered, but the child became fatigued and refused to eat, with diarrhea worsening. The Yigong San was then combined with Saussurea and Uncaria, and after four doses, the child was cured.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child consumed raw and cold food, resulting in abdominal pain and constipation. After taking a harsh purge, five bouts of diarrhea occurred, accompanied by belching and abdominal pain. I believed the heart and spleen were weak and cold, so I prescribed Yigong San with ginger, cinnamon, and Saussurea, but the child refused this treatment in favor of gastric fire remedies, leading to increased belching. I then added a piece of Aconite to the earlier medication, and after one dose, all symptoms improved; afterwards, I removed the Aconite, and after three doses, the child recovered. At that time, another child with the same condition who was treated with phlegm-clearing and stomach-cooling methods unfortunately passed away, with cold extremities.</p>
<p>A small child injured from eating experienced vomiting and fever with a red face. After taking digestive and heat-clearing medicines, the appetite returned, but the fever and redness did not subside. I believed the stomach&#39;s channel was weak and hot, so I prescribed Four Doses of Six Gentleman, Cimicifuga, and Bupleurum, and the child was cured.</p>
<p>Another small child injured from eating experienced vomiting with blood visible during vomiting. After taking purging medicine, the stools became bloody, and the lips turned pale or even blue. I assessed that the spleen was deficient and the liver was overacting, prompting me to have the child take Zhongyixitang to tonify Qi and Yigong San far from meals, allowing the saliva and blood to return to their origins, thus leading to recovery.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

<p>A young child vomited yellow water after consuming food that was all sweet. Yellow Diarrhea Powder was used to clear the stomach heat, resulting in recovery.

<p>Another young child suffered from food injury, vomited continually, and had green diarrhea, showing a sleepy gaze with cold hands and feet, a black forehead, and bluish lips. I indicated: &quot;The green stool signifies wood overpowering earth; this might occasionally be due to loose stools from insufficient spleen qi; a black forehead and bluish lips indicate cold water countering earth, all related to a deficiency of central qi and cold.&quot; I used Wumei Yigong San, adding Shenma, Chaihu, Mu Xiang, and Fuzi, and they recovered after two doses.</p>
<p>A young child experienced vomiting and diarrhea due to intense heat.

<p>Another young child developed a fever and diarrhea around the midnight hours, and got better with Yihuang San. However, the symptoms recurred.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffering from summer heat, experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, with undigested food, may be treated with herbal drinks like Huanglian or Xiangru. If they present with abdominal bloating and pain, and their hands and feet are cold, this indicates a deficiency of the spleen energy with hidden internal yin. The condition can be remedied with Wumei Yigong San, adding Muxiang. The late emperor once stated: when summer heat causes vomiting and diarrhea, if the hands and feet feel warm, accompanied by thirst for cold drinks, this belongs to a yang pattern, thus it is appropriate to use cooling medicines; if the hands and feet feel cold, with thirst for warm beverages, it belongs to a yin pattern and should be treated with warming and tonifying medicines. Hence, if an adult has a yin condition and mistakenly uses cold medicines, their limbs may turn dark and cold after death, and in severe cases, the entire body may exhibit this, which can be observed.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child injures their stomach through overeating, leading to persistent vomiting and diarrhea with greenish or excessively thin stools, appearing to sleep with open eyes, and having cold hands and feet, with a dark forehead and bluish lips. I believe that greenish diarrhea indicates the liver overpowering spleen earth; if the stools are thin and white, this suggests a deficiency and coldness of spleen earth. The dark forehead and bluish lips imply that cold water is attacking the earth, all pointing to a deficiency of central energy and coldness. The condition can be treated with Wumei Yigong San, adding Shengma, Chaihu, Muxiang, and Fuzhi, resulting in recovery with one dose.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child is vomiting, experiencing fever with a flushed face. After administering digestive medicines, while the food has been digested, the fever and flush remain. I suspect this indicates a deficiency of stomach energy with residual heat. I would suggest using Liujunzi with additional Shengma and Chaihu, each twice the dosage, which would yield recovery after four doses.</p>
<p>In a final case, a young child shows a lethargic gaze, with foul-smelling stools, likely caused by drinking milk during a cross-symptomatic period. This can be treated with Sijunzi, adding Muxiang and Huoxiang to ensure stability.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child vomited sour milk, and together with the Four Gentlemen, Wu Zhu, Huang Lian, and Mu Xiang, the treatment strengthened the spleen and calmed the liver, leading to recovery. Later, the child had sour water in the mouth, and the same medicine was used, and the child recovered. Subsequently, the child had bitter water in saliva and a bitter taste in the mouth. Long Dan Tang was used to clear the liver fire, supplemented by the Four Gentlemen to nourish the spleen&#39;s earth, and thus recovery was achieved.</p>
<p>Another young child had yellow water in saliva, or a sweet taste in the mouth, and everything he ate was sweet. The treatment was to use the Clear Yellow Powder for recovery. Later, milk and food were stopped, and he took medicines to overcome it, but with a sweet taste and no appetite, he was extremely weak, treated with the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Primer&quot; states: Huang Chengwu&#39;s child, aged two, fell ill from eating too much and had diarrhea. The doctors advised to stop it, but after more than ten days, the stools were greenish-white, and the milk and food did not digest. The body felt cold and there was a feeling of something stuck in the throat along with drowsiness; everyone said he was severely ill, and money was summoned. First, he was given Yi Huang San and Bu Fei San each three doses; after three days, the body warmed and no longer felt obstructed. Then, with a small amount of white cakes, he was slightly purged, and an additional three doses of Yi Pi San were given to stop the diarrhea. Why was this the case? The diarrhea stemmed from a weak spleen. Initially harming the food and not purging it left it stuck for ten days, leading to an excess above and deficiency below. A weak spleen qi pulls down the lung, hence the interdependence of spleen and lung. If the spleen was first nourished, then the lung illness would recede, resulting in warmth and no obstruction; afterwards, the harm from food could be purged. Someone asked: Why not purge first and then nourish? The response was that the stools turning green indicated a cold lower body; if purged first, there would be great deficiency. Now, first strengthening the spleen and then purging would prevent that deficiency. After, further nourishment was provided to ensure stability.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p></div>

After three days, I added three qian of ginseng, along with ginger, cinnamon, Wu zhu, and nutmeg, yet there was still no improvement.

I had no choice but to use five to six qian of ginseng, along with one or two qian of aconite, ginger, and cinnamon. As soon as he swallowed, he vomited everything without retaining a drop, and what he expelled was white and pure, still resembling milk.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I sat quietly in my study, contemplating the reasons for my condition, and I measured how the cold air attacked my stomach, causing me to continuously vomit and have diarrhea. If I set aside herbs like ginseng, ginger, cinnamon, and aconite, what other remedies could there be? My skills had reached their limit; I was in a dire situation. After much thought, suddenly in the middle of the night, an idea arose: I believed my stomach had become extremely weak, and if the medicine’s flavor was even slightly unsuitable, my stomach would be unable to accept it, leading to rejection. Moreover, the salty flavor of aconite could also induce vomiting—this was surely part of the problem.</p>
<p>I then assessed the flavors of various remedies and decided that a sweet and spicy medicine was necessary, which might soothe my stomach and restore my appetite. I used three qian of pepper, crushed it, and added one liang of ginger, then brewed it with two sheng of water until reduced to eight parts. I set this aside for later use. Additionally, I took two liang of ginseng and brewed it with two sheng of water until reduced to one sheng, also setting it aside.</p>
<p>With these two remedies, I aimed to obtain their sweet and spicy essence. I then blended the two by mixing one tea spoonful of ginseng broth with ten spoonfuls of the pepper-ginger broth, resulting in a slightly sweet and spicy flavor—exactly what would be suitable. I warmed this mixture in hot broth, gradually spooning it to myself, in a steady manner, until I could consume it completely.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Alas! The rebirth of this child is indeed destined by heaven. However, when we examine the causes, it is clear that the body&#39;s vital energy is tied to the back. With a thin mattress and cold nights, the chill enters through the back, deeply affecting the internal organs. The methods of treatment rely on the use of medicine; if the ingredients are appropriate but incompatible with the patient&#39;s condition, achieving effectiveness becomes difficult. Moreover, if hunger induces agitation and the spirit fails to grasp its subtleties, using a cooler remedy rashly will lead to total failure, and the harm is indeed significant! Thus, I write this to illustrate the severity of the illness, the connection of ingredients, and the variability in diagnosis and treatment—matters of such importance. However, this is particularly about my own child, hence I trust this remedy. If it were another&#39;s child suffering from the same illness, and during the process of treatment with ginseng there is no improvement, they might assume the medicine is inadequate and hastily criticize the treatment, opting for bitter cold remedies, which could lead to death and yet still blame the use of ginseng. At such a moment, how can we discern right from wrong? Therefore, I elaborate on this matter to broaden people&#39;s understanding.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the capital, there was a young man named Qian Xuyang, who was around fourteen years old. During the summer, he sustained a spleen injury from eating raw fruits, leading to initial diarrhea followed by dysentery. Xuyang was good at medicine and understood that it was merely an injury from consuming cold foods. He prescribed warming herbs such as ginseng, atractylodes, ginger, and cinnamon to strengthen the spleen, but the diarrhea and dysentery did not improve. Instead, sores began to form on his lips and mouth. When consulting again, he said: &quot;This child is clearly injured by cold; now, if warming medicines are ineffective, what can be done?&quot; I replied: &quot;This is due to the diarrhea injuring the yin, coupled with the sudden intake of spicy foods, which has caused the empty fire to flare up. It cannot be resolved without aconite to return the fire to its original source.&quot; After two doses were administered, the sores on his lips and mouth became painfully intense, and the swelling in the throat worsened, visibly affecting his face, and his condition intensified. Again consulting, he remarked: &quot;The medications are not having the desired effect; could it truly be due to damp heat?&quot; I diagnosed and said: &quot;The pulse in the upper body and the output from the lower body indicate that this is not true heat but rather a deficiency of yang.&quot;<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>今热之不效，虽属可疑，然究其所归，寒之则死，必无疑也。意者，药犹未及耳。旭阳曰：尚有一证，似属真寒，今其所用汤饮，必欲极滚极热者，余等不能入口，而彼则安然吞之，即其喉口肿痛如此，所不顾也，岂其证乎？余曰：是矣是矣！遂复增附子一钱五分，及姜、桂、肉果、人参、熟地之属，其泻渐止，泻止而喉口等证，不一日而全收矣。疑似之间，难辨如此，使非有确持之见，万无一生矣。余自经此以来，渐至不惑，后有数儿证治大同者，俱得保全。噫！此不惑之道，其要何居？在知本之所在耳。临证者可无慎哉！<a id="orig-149p" href="#trans-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now, if the heat does not respond, though it raises suspicion, in the end, if it were cold, it would surely lead to death, leaving no doubt. One might say that the medicine has yet to take effect. Xuyang said: &quot;There is still one proof, seemingly from true cold. The decoction used now must be extremely hot; we cannot swallow it, yet they consume it without concern, even though their throat swells and hurts, disregarding that. Could it not be a sign?&quot; I said: &quot;Exactly, exactly!&quot; Thus, we added one and a half taels of aconite, along with ginger, cinnamon, jujube, ginseng, and cooked reishi. The diarrhea gradually stopped, and with it, the swelling and pain in the throat and mouth resolved completely in less than a day. In this uncertainty, it is hard to discern, so if one does not have a firm understanding, it is exceedingly difficult to live on. Since I experienced this, I have gradually become unconfused; later, there were several cases treated similarly, all preserved. Alas! What is the essence of this path to clarity? It lies in knowing the root of the matter. Those facing cases should be very cautious!<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A small child had diarrhea, with the stools hot and red, and the urine scanty and dark. This indicated heat accumulating internally. First, I prescribed a dose of Sijuling Powder with fried Huanglian to quickly reduce the heat. Then, I used a dose of Qiwwei Baizhu Powder, omitting the Mu Xiang, which promptly stopped the thirst due to heat. Afterwards, I used Sijun Decoction combined with Shengma to regulate and restore health.</p>
<p>In my early years in the capital, I treated a five-year-old girl from the neighborhood. When visiting a medicine shop, her father mistakenly thought a dried seed of the Croton plant was a pine nut and gave her one to eat. She bit into it, tasted the spiciness, and quickly spat it out, but had already swallowed half a seed. Shortly after, she had more than ten bouts of diarrhea. The next day, after the diarrhea, her belly and body became swollen, and she refused to eat, prompting her to seek treatment from me. Some suggested using Huanglian and Lu Dou to detoxify, while others recommended Sijuling and Wupizi to promote urination. I said, after such a major attack, isn&#39;t this a case of great deficiency? Could she withstand the cold treatment again to disrupt her spleen? After such significant diarrhea, what water remains to be expelled? Therefore, I decided to use only Shenling Powder and Warm Stomach Decoction to nurture the spleen qi. Within a few doses, she returned to her original state. Since there had been major diarrhea, why was there such swelling afterward? This instance shows that significant deficiency and cold can lead to swelling, and many cases are similar.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>
