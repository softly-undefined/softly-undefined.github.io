<p><strong>Entry on Jaundice</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Huangdi Neijing, Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>In the center, dampness is born; dampness produces earth; earth generates sweetness; sweetness nourishes the spleen, which appears as yellow in color. [Note: Yellow is the color of central earth.]</p>
<p><strong>From the Yujizhen Zang Lun</strong></p>
<p>Wind is the chief of all diseases. When wind and cold invade a person, it causes the hair to stand straight and the skin to close, resulting in heat. At this time, one may sweat and expel it. If there is numbness and swelling, one may use hot compresses or fire needling to remove it. If untreated, the liver transmits this to the spleen, resulting in a condition called &quot;spleen wind.&quot; Jaundice occurs when there is heat in the abdomen, leading to worry and yellow excretion. [Note: Jaundice arises from external damp heat. Heat in the abdomen leads to worry and yellow excretion, indicating internal heat.]</p>
<p><strong>From the Pingren Qixiang Lun</strong></p>
<p>If someone is yellow and lies down in comfort, it is jaundice. If after eating they feel hungry, it is stomach jaundice. If the eyes are yellow, it is known as jaundice. [Note: This recognizes the disease through observation of symptoms.]</p>
<p><strong>From the Tongping Xushi Lun</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Jaundice with violent pain, mania, and convulsions are all the result of prolonged imbalance. [Note: Jaundice is caused by internal damp heat stagnation manifesting externally, arising from the imbalance of yin, yang, and the five elements over time.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Channels and Vessels</strong></p>
<p>The Spleen meridian of the Foot Taiyin is responsible for diseases arising from the spleen, including diarrhea, abdominal distension, water retention, and jaundice. 【Note: The spleen is considered a solid organ.】</p>
<p>The Kidney meridian of the Foot Shaoyin governs diseases arising from the kidneys, such as dryness and heat in the mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat, shortness of breath, dry and painful throat, anxiety, heart pain, and jaundice. 【Note: The kidneys govern the storage of essence. When there are kidney diseases, essence cannot rise to nourish, resulting in symptoms like dryness and heat in the mouth, dry throat, anxiety, heart pain, and jaundice. This shows that when water does not nourish, fire becomes excessive above.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Diagnosing Diseases by the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>Body pain with a slight yellowish hue, yellowish tongue coating, yellow nails, indicates jaundice. If the person is comfortable lying down, with yellow-red urine and a weak, thin pulse, they have no appetite. 【Note: When the earth fails to nourish the four organs, body pain arises, indicating problems with the flesh; yellow in color indicates issues with the skin; yellowish tongue coating suggests problems with the bones; yellow nails indicate issues with the tendons; jaundice indicates diseases of the spleen. Due to spleen disease, one is compelled to rest comfortably. The small intestine is referred to as the red intestine, which is part of the heart&#39;s system. The heart governs the blood vessels, and yellow-red urine and a weak pulse indicate issues with the vessels. Yellow-red urine suggests heat in the lower jiao. A lack of appetite indicates deficiency in the upper jiao.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer by Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Jaundice: Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The section on jaundice states: If the pulse at the inch is floating and amiable, the floating indicates wind, and the amiable indicates stagnation. Stagnation is not due to wind, yet the limbs suffer discomfort; the spleen is likely yellow, and stagnant heat must move. The pulse at the foot yang is tight and rapid; rapid indicates heat, which depletes nourishment, while tight indicates cold, leading to fullness upon eating. The floating pulse at the inch indicates kidney damage, and the tight pulse at the foot yang indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold clash, consuming grains leads to dizziness, and the grain energy fails to dissipate, resulting in a bitter, turbid stomach; the turbidity descends, causing difficulty in urination. The yin is afflicted by cold, heat flows to the bladder, and the body turns entirely yellow, known as grain jaundice. If the forehead is dark, there is slight sweating, and the hands and feet feel warm, this arises at dusk, with urgent bladder symptoms and spontaneous urination, termed female labor jaundice. </p>
<p>If the abdomen presents a watery appearance, it should not be treated. If there is a feeling of vexation and heat in the heart, with difficulty eating and a desire to vomit, it is called alcoholic jaundice. </p>
<p>For yangming disease, if the pulse is slow, eating becomes difficult, and fullness causes agitation and dizziness, with urination notably difficult, this indicates the onset of grain jaundice. Even with purging, the abdomen remains distended, attributed to the slow pulse. </p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there must be difficulty in urination; accompanying signs include heat in the heart and warmth in the feet. For alcoholic jaundice, some may lack heat, but their words are clear; the abdomen feels full and there is a desire to vomit, with a dry nose. The floating pulse should first be induced to vomit, and the sinking pulse should first be purged. </p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic jaundice, if there is a feeling of heat in the heart accompanied by a desire to vomit, inducing vomiting will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The jaundice descends, and over time it becomes dark jaundice. The eyes turn blue and the face blackens; the heart feels as if it has consumed garlic. The stool is distinctly dark, the skin and nails show numbness, and the pulse is superficial and weak, though it appears slightly yellow. Therefore, it is understood.</p>
<p>The teacher said: For those suffering from yellow jaundice, with fever, restlessness, and shortness of breath, these symptoms arise from the illness, where fire consumes the sweat and both heats are at play. However, yellow jaundice is obtained from dampness. When the entire body feels overheated, with a yellow face and a hot belly, it must be treated immediately.</p>
<p>A deep, thirsty pulse and difficulty in urination indicate the presence of yellow. A swollen abdomen, a coated yellow tongue, and inability to sleep due to restlessness are signs of yellow jaundice.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The disease of jaundice should be dealt with within eighteen days. If treated for more than ten days without improvement, it becomes difficult to manage. </p>
<p>In cases where jaundice is accompanied by thirst, it is hard to treat; if there is no thirst, it is treatable. If the jaundice originates in the lower regions, the patient will certainly vomit; if from the upper regions, they will experience chills and fever. </p>
<p>For granular jaundice, there will be cold and heat with loss of appetite. Eating will cause dizziness and discomfort in the chest; prolonged yellowing indicates granular jaundice, which is primarily treated with the Yinchaihao Decoction. </p>
<p>In women, when jaundice appears in the afternoon with fever followed by chills, it results from labor. There will be urgency in the bladder and fullness in the lower abdomen. If the body is completely yellow, the forehead black, and the feet hot, it indicates black jaundice. The abdomen will be swollen, resembling water, with black and often loose stools; this condition is due to labor and not related to water. A swollen abdomen is hard to treat; it is managed with a powder of nitrate and alum.</p>
<p>For alcoholic jaundice, with feelings of discomfort or heat pain in the heart, the Zhizi Dahuang Decoction is used. </p>
<p>For all jaundice conditions, promoting urination is important. Even if the pulse is floating, treatment should commence with sweating; Gui Zhi Jia Huang Qi Decoction is appropriate for this case. </p>
<p>For all types of jaundice, the Zhu Gao Fah Jian (Pig Fat Decoction) is suitable for treatment.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Jaundice is treated with Yinchen Wuling Powder. </p>
<p>For jaundice with abdominal fullness, difficult urination, and red urine, alongside spontaneous sweating, this indicates an exterior harmony with interior excess. It should be treated with Da Huang Xiao Shi Decoction. </p>
<p>For jaundice where the urine color does not change and the patient wishes to urinate, with abdominal fullness and difficulty breathing, one should not eliminate heat, as its removal will cause hiccups. Hiccups are treated with Xiao Ban Xia Decoction. </p>
<p>For those with jaundice accompanied by abdominal pain and vomiting, Chai Hu Decoction should be used. </p>
<p>In males with jaundice where urination is smooth, one should administer the Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction for deficiency due to overwork. </p>
<p>According to the Water Pathology chapter, interior water causes the entire body and face to turn yellow and swell, with a deep pulse and difficult urination, hence causing water diseases. If the urine flows smoothly, it indicates a loss of body fluids, leading to thirst. This should be treated with Yao Bing Jiazhu Decoction.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>The Suwen says: In cases of Taiyang disease, if the body is yellow, the pulse is deep and tied, with distension in the lower abdomen and difficulty in urination, it indicates a lack of blood. If urination is spontaneous and the person appears delirious, this indicates blood evidence, to be treated with Ditan Decoction. In Taiyang disease with wind, sweat is expelled by fire, and the evil wind with heat disrupts the flow of blood and qi, causing the body to turn yellow. If Yang is excessive, there is a desire to sneeze; if Yin is deficient, urination is difficult. If both Yin and Yang are exhausted, the body becomes dry, with only head sweating that rolls down, slight abdominal fullness, mild wheezing, dry mouth, and a sore throat, possibly no bowel movements; if prolonged, there may be delirium, and in severe cases, nausea occurs, with hands and feet restless, fidgeting with clothing and touching the bed. If urination is smooth, the person can be treated.</p>
<p>For cold damage with sweating, if the body and eyes turn yellow, it is because the cold and dampness inside have not been resolved. One should not purge; instead, look for remedies within the cold and dampness. If there is stasis heat inside due to cold damage, the body will certainly turn yellow, and Ma Huang, Lian Qiao, and Xiao Dou Decoction should be used. After seven to eight days of cold damage, if the body appears orange-yellow and urination is difficult, with slight abdominal fullness, Yin Chen Hao Decoction should be used. If there is increased body heat with yellowing, Zhi Zi and Ban Bei Decoction should be used. </p>
<p>The Yangming section states: If the pulse is floating and slow, with warm hands and feet, it indicates a connection to Taiyin. Taiyin conditions cause the body to turn yellow. However, if urination is smooth, yellowing cannot occur. If after seven to eight days there is constipation, it indicates a Yangming disease. With cold damage transitioning to Yangming, the person will show slight sweating.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>In cases of Yangming syndrome, the pulse is wiry, floating, and large with shortness of breath. The abdomen feels full, there is pain under the ribs and in the heart, prolonged pressure does not relieve the qi. The nose is dry, there is no sweating, the patient desires to lie down, the entire body and face are yellow, urination is difficult, there is tidal fever, occasional belching, swelling in front of and behind the ears, and needling provides only slight relief but does not resolve the issue. </p>
<p>If, after ten days of illness, the pulse continues to be floating, administer the Xiao Chai Hu Tang. If the pulse is merely floating with no other symptoms, use Ma Huang Tang. If there is no urination and abdominal fullness with belching, do not treat. </p>
<p>In Yangming illness, if the face turns red, it must not be attacked; there will definitely be fever and a yellow complexion, along with difficult urination. If there is fever and sweating, it indicates excessive heat and thus cannot produce a yellow complexion.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If there is sweating from the head but none from the body, with a tense neck, difficulty urinating, and thirst for water, this indicates that there is stagnant heat inside. The body will certainly turn yellow; Yao Chen Hao Decoction is indicated for this.</p>
<p>In cold damage, when both yin and yang pulses are tight, if there are chills and fever, the pulse tends to become faint. When it is faint, the pulse initially comes strong, then gradually weakens, before returning to strong again; this is its characteristic. In such cases, chills may be severe, with excessive sweating and sore throat. If heat is excessive, the eyes will be red and the pulse vigorous, leading to blurred vision. If a physician induces vomiting, there will be injury to the throat; if purging occurs again, both eyes may close. If cold is dominant, the stool will be clear; if heat is dominant, the stool will contain pus and blood. If one steams, the body turns yellow; if one applies heat, the throat becomes dry. If urination is easy, this condition can be saved; if difficult, it is dangerous.</p>
<p>In Yangming disease, if there is no sweating, difficulty urinating, and a feeling of discomfort in the heart, the body will surely turn yellow. In Yangming disease caused by fire, if there is slight sweating on the forehead and difficulty urinating, it will definitely lead to yellowing of the skin.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Jaundice</h3>
<p>Jaundice comes in five types: yellow sweat, yellow jaundice, grain jaundice, wine jaundice, and female labor jaundice. </p>
<p><strong>Yellow Sweat</strong>: This type presents with slight swelling of the limbs and a feeling of fullness in the chest without thirst. Sweat appears as yellow as the juice of phellodendron. It is mainly caused by excessive sweating followed by sudden immersion in water.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Jaundice</strong>: The entire body and face turn yellow like an orange. It is caused by exposure to heat and then being washed with cold water, leaving heat in the stomach, which is further aggravated by eating cucumbers. If it develops into black jaundice, the prognosis is poor.</p>
<p><strong>Grain Jaundice</strong>: After eating, one may feel dizzy, and there is an uneasy and repressed sensation in the heart along with yellowing of the skin. This results from neglecting hunger, leading to large meals, causing gas to rise and accumulate in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Wine Jaundice</strong>: This condition involves heart pain, swelling in the legs and shins, yellow urine, and reddish-yellow spots on the face, arising from excessive drunkenness combined with exposure to wind and water.</p>
<p><strong>Female Labor Jaundice</strong>: The body and eyes are both yellow, accompanied by fever and chills, a distended lower abdomen, and difficulty urinating. This occurs due to excessive labor and heat, culminating in immersion in water.</p>
<p>When it comes to the disease of wet jaundice, its initial presentation involves body pain, fever, and a black-yellow complexion. After seven to eight days, there is strong heat inside, and if there is blood present, it should be expelled immediately in a manner resembling liver from a pig. If there is distension in the lower abdomen, it should be treated urgently.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>The Book for the Living</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Gong, Song Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Symptoms and Treatment of Jaundice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> A person experiences pain all over the body, fever, yellowing of the skin, difficulty in urination, and frequent bowel movements.<br><strong>Answer:</strong> This condition is called &quot;middle dampness.&quot; Wind and rain invade the body&#39;s defenses, and the dampness from mountains and marshes affects many people. Dampness flows into the joints, causing bodily discomfort, with a pulse that is deep and slow, indicating &quot;middle dampness,&quot; which results in overall pain, fever, and yellow skin. If urination is smooth, a remedy like Atractylodes and Prepared Aconite Decoction is appropriate. However, if urination is difficult and bowel movements are frequent, it is necessary to promote urination; in this case, Licorice and Aconite Decoction or Wuling Powder should be used.<br>The patient has internal cold dampness that has not dissipated, heat accumulating in the spleen and stomach, blocked pores, and stagnant heat mingling with undigested food, hence the yellowing. Both yellowing and blood stasis have similar outward signs and pulse indications, but difficulty in urination is associated with yellowing, while smooth urination indicates blood stasis. In essence, a person with yellowing has accumulation in the heart and spleen, leading to fever that prompts thirst; the pulse is likely to be floating, slippery, and rapid. In contrast, the blood stasis condition resembles mania, and the stool will be black; this distinction is key.<br>When a patient feels feverish, has sweating on the forehead while the body remains dry, and experiences thirst with difficulty in urination, this will certainly lead to yellowing; the appropriate prescription is Yinchenhao Decoction with Wuling Powder. After taking the decoction, if urination improves—such as producing reddish liquid similar to soapberry juice—and the abdomen feels lighter overnight, then the yellowing will be expelled through urination.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The ancients said: &quot;To treat dampness not benefiting urination is not the proper treatment.&quot; One may select from the recipes of Gardenia and Cortex Ponciri Decoction, or Ephedra, Forsythia, and Red Adzuki Bean Decoction. Additionally, for those suffering from a cold wanting to turn yellow, urgently use the powdered gourd stem, hold water in the mouth, and (allow it) to enter the nose, causing yellow fluid to be discharged; this is very effective. One may also use Artemisia and Wormwood Decoction adjusted with Wuling Powder; this is the best method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if asked: &quot;In White Tiger syndrome, there is also body heat, irritability, thirst for drink, and difficulty in urination. Why does it not turn yellow?&quot; The answer is: &quot;White Tiger is similar to the yellowing syndrome; sweating occurs all over the body, which is considered heat excess, thus it is White Tiger syndrome. When sweating occurs on the head and face, but none below the neck, this indicates yellowing syndrome.&quot;</p>
<p>If asked: &quot;In a Taiyang disease, if the entire body is in pain and feels like burning yellow, what does that mean?&quot; The reply is: &quot;This is dampness within the Taiyang. Zhongjing states that if sweating occurs from a cold damage, and the body and eyes turn yellow, it is because cold dampness in the interior has not resolved, and thus should not be purged. One should look for the condition within the cold dampness.&quot;</p>
<p>If inquired: &quot;For a patient with a wiry, floating pulse and shortness of breath, a full abdomen, pain under the ribs and in the heart, persistent pressure leading to obstruction, dry nose without sweating, excessive sleepiness, and the whole body and face turning yellow, with difficult urination and periodic coughing, what would this indicate?&quot; The answer is: &quot;This is a lesser yang wind; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is the main treatment.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Hejian&#39;s Six Diagnoses</strong> 【Jin, Liu Wansu】</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the stomach is empty like hunger, the heat in the stomach can digest grain. The Yangming meridians and the heart fire ascend, causing the heart to feel restless, the face to turn yellow, and the urine to be red and turbid. This condition is treated with the Poria Decoction with modifications. </p>
<p>The stagnation of the spleen is called &quot;repression qi,&quot; located in the gastric cavity, which is large like a cup. If it does not heal for a long time, it leads to limbs not retracting, causes jaundice, and food fails to nourish the skin. According to Zhongjing, if there is only sweating from the head and none from the body, with discomfort in the neck and difficulty in urination, and thirst for water, then the body will surely turn yellow. This indicates that heat is present at the surface, being dry and without sweat, while damp-heat is inside. The qi is so obstructed that it cannot disperse outward; thus, the damp-heat qi becomes extremely repressed and ascends, leading to the face and head showing signs of extreme yang. As a result, damp-heat condenses into slight sweating, but there is no sweat below the neck. However, damp-heat cannot naturally disperse and circulate throughout the body, leading to severe repression, causing the complexion to turn yellow. Therefore, in the case of Baihu Decoction, if there is spontaneous sweating all over the body, Zhongjing refers to it as &quot;dispersing outward,&quot; and there is no yellowing of the skin.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Those who experience difficulty in urination are exhibiting signs of damp-heat leading to jaundice. Some may have smooth urination, or experience mania, or have black stools, indicative of blood stasis. There are also cases of jaundice accompanied by delirium, which I do not mention here, as the signs of jaundice are not yet clear, so there is no need to elaborate. In society, there is a belief that cauterization for jaundice may lead to recovery; however, this applies to individuals with strong constitutions who do not have weakened middle qi, but merely mild damp-heat stagnation. If cauterization is misapplied, it could forcibly open the channels, leading to a release of qi and blood, resulting in sweating and recovery. Conversely, in individuals with inherently weak constitutions, if damp-heat is severe, forcible opening may lead instead to death, which is not rare. It is preferable to use Zhang Jing&#39;s methods to treat the condition with medicine, avoiding the risks of a violent intervention that may endanger life. Furthermore, recent misconceptions have circulated that extreme cold and severe jaundice are to be salvaged by rescuing the yang, which has caused numerous harms. If a mild illness is mistakenly addressed with forced opening and succeeds, such cases are rare, and the risks to life are immense. Generally, all forms of jaundice can be categorized into two types: one resulting from damp-heat and qi stagnation, which is universally applicable.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Just as wheat sprouts in the rain, when the heat and humidity are excessive, it leads to jaundice; during waterlogging and hot, humid weather, plants wither and turn yellow. If someone suffers from blood deficiency, they may become weak, and if dryness and heat become too severe, their body and face may turn yellow, much like how plants wither in drought. For those who are ill with dryness and heat leading to jaundice, the focus should be on reducing heat and moistening dryness. In cases of severe cold damage accompanied by humidity leading to jaundice, relieving the blockage and reducing heat while promoting drainage through both major and minor bodily channels can restore balance and aid recovery.</p>
<p>For jaundice accompanied by chest blockage, one should take equal parts of Yin Chen (artemisia) and Xian Xiong Decoction. If there is a misuse of Ba Dou (castor bean) heat-clearing pills, this can harm yin energy and excessively promote heat without resolution, leading to jaundice. In this case, taking equal parts of Da Cheng Qi Decoction can help. There are also instances where excessive heat and unrelieved conditions lead to jaundice; for those with chest blockage, add five parts of Yin Chen, three parts of Xian Xiong Decoction, and two parts of Da Cheng Qi Decoction to address it. If jaundice arises from dual environmental factors, then adding Huang Lian (coptis) detoxifying decoction for immediate relief may be necessary.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>If there is slight sweating on the head, with a mild yellowish appearance and easy urination, this indicates mild damp-heat; one should use Gardenia and Cortex Phellodendri Decoction. In cases of severe yellowing, use Yinchenhao combined with San-Yi Chengqi Decoction. </p>
<p>In Yangming disease, when there is extreme exterior heat, causing irritability and thirst, along with retained fluids that do not disperse, resulting in the clash of damp and heat leading to yellowing of the body, the signs are usually sweating on the head without sweating on the body, a stiff neck, difficulty urinating, and a thirst for water. For such cases, use Yinchen Decoction adjusted with Wuling Powder.</p>
<p>When yellowing occurs due to the convergence of cold and damp, its color resembles that of mossy sludge. If one has suffered from a cold and has mistakenly induced sweating, warmed, cauterized, or pressed, or taken toxic heat-clearing medications like silver powder or large doses of Ba Dou, leading to the depletion of fluids and damage to yin energy, causing the evil heat to escalate; or if purging is done too early, causing heat to form a obstructive mass in the chest, resulting in yellowing; or if improper cold treatment is applied; or if extreme heat originates from a serious condition and even with correct treatment cannot dispel the significant heat; or if heat remains unrelieved after purging—all of these can lead to yellowing. Generally, the root cause arises from extreme heat stagnation causing retained fluids which clash with damp-heat; thus, misapplying Zhuru Fuzheng Decoction is a mistake.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Ming Theory</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wujি)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to jaundice, how can this be clarified? The classical texts state: when dampness and heat intersect, the people will suffer from “tan” (jaundice). “Tan” refers to yellow; it is the manifestation of pure yang without yin. When cold damage leads to jaundice, it signifies a severe condition. When damp heat is intense, jaundice will appear; when internal heat is already strong and is further aggravated by fire, jaundice will also manifest. If the evil wind combines with fire heat, the two forms of yang will scorch each other, leading to jaundice. In cases of yangming disease, if there is slight sweating on the forehead and the urination is obstructed, jaundice must occur. This is due to internal heat combined with fire leading to jaundice. In yangming disease, if there is no sweating, obstructed urination, and a feeling of frustration in the heart, jaundice must occur. This is due to excess heat in yangming causing jaundice. If cold damage has caused sweating and the body and eyes turn yellow, the reason is that the cold dampness inside has not been resolved, as one cannot eliminate it through purging; jaundice is sought amidst cold dampness. This is jaundice caused by cold dampness. Both dampness and heat may lead to jaundice; can one distinguish between them? The two differ not only in their fundamental nature but also in their appearance. The jaundice from dampness is like a smoky yellow, dark and unclear despite its yellow hue. In contrast, the jaundice from excessive heat presents as a bright orange-yellow; in severe cases, it can stain clothing vividly, displaying the true yellow akin to “ban zhi” juice.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>From this observation, are humidity and heat not different? Generally, the Huang family corresponds to the Taiyin; Taiyin is associated with the spleen. The spleen represents earth, and yellow is the color of earth. When the spleen channel is vaporized by damp heat, the color appears externally, leading to a yellow body. The classic states: if the pulse in febrile illness is floating and slow, and the hands and feet are warm, this indicates a connection to Taiyin; it is indeed the Taiyin that causes the body to turn yellow. Although the internal heat may be strong, if there is already sweating and ease of urination, it will not lead to yellowing. If the head is sweating but the body doesn&#39;t, with a reaction in the neck and difficulty in urination, along with thirst for water, this signifies stagnation of heat internally, and the body will definitely turn yellow. The Huang family represents a strong heat syndrome, and its treatment must be distinct. After eight or nine days of febrile illness, if the body appears orange-yellow and there is difficulty in urination with fullness in the lower abdomen, then Yīn Chén Hāo Decoction should be prescribed; this aims to drain and cleanse the heat.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>For those with fever and yellowing of the body due to typhoid, the main remedy is the Gardenia and Phellodendron Decoction, aimed at dispelling the heat. If there is residual heat inside from typhoid, the body will surely turn yellow; in this case, the main remedy is the Ephedra, Forsythia, and Red Bean Decoction, also intended to disperse the heat. These remedies vary in their methods of purging and dissolving, yet they all serve to extract fire and clear heat. </p>
<p>If one presents with yellowing of the body, a sinking and knotty pulse, a distended lower abdomen, and voluntary urination that is akin to madness, this indicates that stagnant blood in the lower burner is causing the yellowing, and the resistance must be overcome with a decoction to promote recovery. </p>
<p>Yellowness signifies a severe illness; therefore, there are many who do not recover. It&#39;s not just that the pulse is absent at the wrist or coldness exudes from the nose, which indicates an incurable condition. Additionally, if the body resembles something smoked and the person stares while shaking their head, this signifies a severe heart condition; if the lips are dark and there is soft sweat appearing yellow, this indicates a severe spleen condition—both are signs of an incurable diagnosis.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms are caused by wind and cold injuring the body, leading to the descent of yang energy into the interior, while cold water rises along the meridians. The proper response should be to induce sweating to dispel the evil influence; if the physician neglects this and fails to induce sweating, jaundice will develop. The spleen governs the muscles, and the combination of cold dampness in the limbs with internal heat leads to the manifestation of jaundice. </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If one is not to take Wuling San, what symptoms will arise?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> If one does not take it, food will not be digested, water will be eliminated, and the body will weaken, leading to dryness and heat in the Yangming, accumulating in the stomach and causing jaundice. Thus, there will be symptoms of a regulated stomach decoction, as this entails a failure to descend properly due to not having taken Wuling San. </p>
<p>If heat is present in the middle burner but has not yet reached the origin of the Taiyang, and urination is clear and smooth, this indicates that fluids have circulated. If Wuling San is used to promote urination, it would further deplete the kidney&#39;s water. Not only does this deplete the kidney&#39;s water, but it also prevents the heat from toxins in alcohol from being resolved, leading to blockage both above and below, resulting in jaundice; if it enters the blood chamber, it would result in blood stasis.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Seeking Causes in Treating Illness</strong></p>
<p>When treating illnesses, one must investigate the underlying causes regardless of symptoms like typhus, blood stagnation, chest tightness, or jaundice, as well as all other miscellaneous symptoms. For instance, if jaundice presents with symptoms like headaches, stiff lower back, and aversion to cold, it indicates a Taiyang syndrome; if there is fever, eye pain, and a dry nose making it difficult to lie down, this indicates a Yangming syndrome. The same principle applies to other conditions.</p>

<p>For difficulty in urination with irritability and thirst, add Poria, Polyporus, Talcum, Angelica, and Cinnamon. [This is known as Han&#39;s Mingying Chen Yingling Decoction.] For irritability, shortness of breath, and vomiting without thirst, add Tangerine Peel, Atractylodes, Pinellia, Ginger, and Poria. [This is known as Han&#39;s Mingying Chen Pi Decoction.] For cold in the limbs and body, add Aconite and Licorice. [This is known as Han&#39;s Mingying Fuzi Decoction.] For cold limbs with spontaneous sweating in the lower back, add Aconite, Dried Ginger, and Licorice. [This is known as Han&#39;s Mingying Jiang Fu Decoction.] For persistent cold sweating, add Aconite and Dried Ginger. [This is known as Han&#39;s Mingying Fuzi Decoction.] If after taking the above herbs the pulse remains subdued, add Evodia, Aconite, Dried Ginger, Muli, and Angelica. [This is known as Han&#39;s Mingying Zhuyutang.] Han has distinctly named formulations such as Mingying Chen Fu Ling Decoction, Mingying Chen Jupi Decoction, Xiaoming Ying Chen Decoction, Mingying Si Ni Decoction, Mingying Fuzi Decoction, and Mingying Zhuyutang.

<p><strong>Treatment of Jaundice</strong>  </p>
<p>The smallpox does not differentiate into the five types; they all share the quality of damp-heat, similar to the characteristics of the Yang. For mild cases, use the small warming pill; for severe cases, use the large warming pill. If there is much heat, add Scutellaria and Lian. In cases of excess dampness, utilize the Yinchen Wuling Powder with digestive herbs. If damp-heat causes reversed stomach Qi leading to diarrhea, treat with Ginseng and Astragalus added to Gardenia, Yinchen, and Licorice. </p>
<p>Dai Yun states: The five types of jaundice manifest as skin and eye discoloration resembling water of Gardenia. If caused by food accumulation resulting in yellowness, assess the condition&#39;s strength and weakness and purge the food accumulation; for others, prioritize promoting urination. Light urination will appear white; the yellowness will subside naturally. </p>
<p>Jaundice arises from heat in the spleen and stomach channel; the cause should be investigated. Focus on purging first and then detoxifying. Symptoms like pale lips, restlessness, tinnitus, weakness in the legs, slight cold with fever, and cloudy urination indicate a deficiency. Treat with Four Gentleman Decoction and swallow the Eight Flavors Pill. Avoid excessive use of cooling agents or overly forceful promotion of urination, as it might lead to kidney water depletion. If the face turns dark yellow and there is thirst, do not treat; if there is no thirst, treatment is possible.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Jaundice presents with a yellow complexion all over; it is advisable to use Wuling San with fresh herbs and add Yinchai. Additionally, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be used with Yinchai, Fuling, and Zhishi, and a small amount of (Shi Bu) Nao. Jisheng Yinchentang can also be used; according to the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions,&quot; thin peach roots should be boiled and taken on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>For biliary jaundice, one feels lightheaded after meals, with a feeling of oppression and unease in the heart, resulting from hunger and satiety. The stomach&#39;s qi rising causes the jaundice; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Gu Ya, Zhishi, Houpo, Shanzhi, and Dahuang is recommended, along with Jisheng Gu Dan Wan.</p>
<p>For alcoholic jaundice, the body and eyes turn yellow, with feelings of frustration in the heart, swollen legs, yellow urine, and a reddish face with spots. This is caused by excessive alcohol heat in the stomach, lying in the wind while drunken, and retention of moisture; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be used with Yinchai, Douchi, Dahuang, Huanglian, and Ge Fen. The pulse is weak and rapid, with a dark blue-black face; there may be black stools, for which Sanyin Baizhu San is prescribed. If the pulse is stringy and rapid, Sanyin Danggui Baizhu San along with Jisheng Wuling Decoction with Ge Gen should be used.</p>
<p>For jaundice due to women&#39;s labor, caused by water retention after sexual activity, presenting with a dark forehead and yellow body, urgent fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficult urination, it is recommended to take a pinch of barley together with equal parts of talc and gypsum, boiled for consumption. If the sweat is yellow due to heat in the spleen and stomach, leading to yellow-stained sweat that does not quench thirst, Jisheng Fang Huangqi San and Yinchai Decoction should be used. Additionally, deep inhalation of a bitter clove the size of a bean can expel yellow water, aiding in recovery.</p>
<p>When presenting with yellow coloration, a pulse that is deep, fine, and slow, with cold extremities and persistent spontaneous sweating, Yinchai Si Ni Decoction is advisable.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Hygienic Treasure</strong><br><strong>[Yuan Dynasty - Luo Tianyi]</strong>  </p>

<p>If the skin is cool, yet there is restlessness and a desire to lie in water, along with wheezing, nausea, and a pulse that is deep, thin, slow, and weak with yellowish coloration, treat with Yinchen Four-Reversal Decoction. If the skin is cold, the area below the heart feels hard and painful when pressed, the body feels heavy, there is severe chill in the back, the eyes do not want to open, there is a lack of speech, spontaneous sweating, clear urination, and the bowel movement is completed but not fully satisfactory, with a pulse that is tight, thin, and slow with yellowish coloration, treat with Yinchen Four-Reversal Decoction. If the body is completely cold, the face looks like the color of peach or plum branches, the abdomen is distended, there is difficult urination, and the pulse at the guan and chi points is deep, thin, slow, and yellowish, the treatment approach is to first use Yinchen Poria Decoction to facilitate urination, and then follow with Yinchen Four-Reversal Decoction with added Angelica and Akebia.  </p>

<p><strong>Discussion of Alcoholic Jaundice</strong>  </p>
<p>Among the five types of jaundice, the variations of alcoholic jaundice are the most numerous. This is because the effects of alcohol vary with individual temperaments—some can consume a stone without becoming drunk, while others merely wet their lips and become disordered. Some individuals have heat toxins that penetrate their meridians, leading not only to yellowing but also causing blackening or swelling of the skin, and if it flows into the clear energy pathways, it results in yellow eyes and a yellow nose, exhibiting various different symptoms.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Five Types of Jaundice Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Including Facial Yellowing)</strong></p>
<p>Jaundice generally has five types: yellow, which indicates the color of the spleen. When the spleen is injured, the illness manifests externally, causing the whole body and face to appear yellow. It is advisable to use a base formula of Wuling Powder with Yinchen (Artemisia capillaris), or a combination of Wuling Powder and Pingwei Powder in equal parts, called Weiling Powder. </p>
<p>Yellow sweat occurs due to heat in the spleen and stomach, leading to sweating that may mix with bathwater, resulting in yellow sweat staining clothes. Only the aforementioned remedy is suitable. </p>
<p>Jaundice due to excessive drinking and eating causes the organs to become extremely heated, additionally impacted by wind and dampness, leading to stagnation that does not disperse. The damp heat condenses, causing both the body and eyes to turn yellow, sometimes accompanied by chills and fever; the prior remedy should be used. </p>
<p>Wine-induced jaundice arises from overconsumption of alcohol, commonly known as wine jaundice. It is best treated with a decoction of dry kudzu or gardenia seeds mixed with Wuling Powder, or with raw Wuling decoction adding a penny’s worth of dry kudzu. </p>
<p>Drinking leads to sleep, letting the wine poison harm the lungs. The spleen (earth) nourishes the lungs (metal); thus, when the lung receives the illness, it affects the spleen, resulting in yellowing. Furthermore, the lungs govern the skin, and since they are exposed to the wine’s toxins, the yellowing appears on the skin. Therefore, these two explanations are valid; treatment should address both the spleen and lungs, preferably using Huo Pi Decoction.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Jaundice occurs due to the harm from irregular eating, causing the stomach qi to become disturbed and resulting in yellowing of the complexion. When food is ingested, dizziness and discomfort may arise, so it is advisable to use red pills. If jaundice arises from damage to the spleen, it has already been observed with previous cases of yellowing. Heat toxins that harm the spleen can also lead to jaundice, and for this, a decoction of reed flowers combined with Wuling powder is recommended.</p>
<p>After loss of blood, the face often turns yellow. Blood is essential for nourishment; a rosy complexion indicates the presence of blood, while its absence results in yellowing. This can be likened to plants: in spring and summer, leaves are green, while in autumn, they turn yellow, signifying the difference between moist and dry conditions. The nourishing decoction, Zhigui decoction, or the Complete Tonifying Decoction should be used. For those who cannot eat, add Huangqi and Biandou each at a small amount to the Four Gentlemen Decoction. Alternatively, adding these two ingredients to Yigong powder is also acceptable. There are cases where the body is completely yellow, but the yellowing does not extend to the ears and eyes.</p>
<p>After an attack of malaria, many people experience yellowing, as malaria is associated with cold in the spleen. When the spleen is affected by illness, the complexion reflects this change. Therefore, it is crucial to address the spleen first. For this condition, Yigong powder with half a small amount of Huangqi and Biandou is also recommended. Any yellowing following other illnesses should also be addressed similarly.</p>
<p>For farmers suffering from jaundice due to overexertion after a full meal, causing spleen qi to become uncomfortably constrained, it is recommended to use the Shen Jin Wan from Master Yang.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation of Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Internal jaundice arises from physical labor and irregularities in diet, with changes in the Central States leading to cold, resulting in the onset of yellowing. It is not caused by external factors, so treating it with Jianzhong, Lizhong, or Dajianzhong is sufficient. Jaundice from improper diet and excessive labor is called &quot;yellow fat,&quot; and is an acute illness. Thus, Zhongjing sets an eighteen-day period for it. Jaundice from dietary labor is a chronic condition, with some cases lingering for a long time. </p>
<p>When it comes to jaundice affecting the eyes, the classics state that eye jaundice means yellowing, but there are instances where the eyes are yellow while the body is not. When the wind qi enters from the Yangming channel into the stomach and travels along the meridians to the eye corners, if the person is heavy and the wind qi cannot escape, it leads to heat in the body, causing yellowing of the eyes. </p>
<p>Black jaundice presents with swelling of the face, back pain preventing upright posture, and a dark complexion, often accompanied by profuse sweating and aversion to wind, indicating wind-related issues. </p>
<p><strong>Differentiation by Color</strong>: If the color is like smoky yellow, it indicates a damp illness, accompanying pain throughout the body; if the color resembles that of oranges, it indicates jaundice with no body pain.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Continuation of the Methods</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage, when encountering the Yang and Yin governing the heavens, if purging is excessive, it often transforms into jaundice. First, there is an excess of cold water, with water invading the earth; second, the earth&#39;s energy is insufficient, allowing water to invade, leading to various manifestations of this illness. </p>
<p>First is the Yinchen and Poria decoction, supplemented with Angelica and Cinnamon; second is the Yinchen and Orange Peel decoction, with added Ginger, Atractylodes, and Pinellia; third is the Yinchen and Aconite decoction; fourth is the Yinchen and Four-Negatives decoction; fifth is the Yinchen and Ginger-Aconite decoction; sixth is the Yinchen and Evodia decoction.</p>
<p>For cold damage in the interior with weak pulse and Qi deficiency leading to jaundice, administer Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Li Zhong decoction with Yinchen. In cases of alternating cold and heat, where the whole body appears yellow, use Xiaochaihu decoction with Gardenia. For jaundice with a feeling of fullness in the chest, it is related to the Taiyang, treated with methods for chest fullness. For a sensation of distension with jaundice, it is associated with the Taiyin, treated with methods for distension.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Diagnosis and Treatment of Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Damp jaundice, with &quot;damp&quot; referring to water, often occurs in the southeastern regions, where wind and rain attack the weak. The steam from mountains and marshes causes many to become afflicted with dampness. When dampness invades the meridians, there is evening fever and nasal congestion; in the joints, there is pain throughout the body; in the organs, there is a mix of clear and turbid in the stools, leading to loose stools and thick urine, while the abdomen may feel swollen. When damp heat combines, the body may turn yellow as if smoke has colored it, with mild cases showing only slight yellowing of the face. Mistaken purging results in wheezing; mistaking sweating leads to convulsions and death. Promoting urination is beneficial, and Wu Ling San (Five Poria Powder) is the primary treatment to eliminate dampness. If urination is hindered and bowel movements are too frequent, use Gan Cao Fu Zi Tang (Licorice and Aconite Decoction). If urine is not yellow, use Zhu Fu Tang (Atractylodes and Aconite Decoction). For body pain and nasal congestion, use Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang (Astragalus Nourishing the Center Decoction). For strong abdominal pressure and urinary retention, add Ting Li to Zhi Zhu Tang (Orange Peel and Atractylodes Decoction). If yellowing appears later. The yellow syndrome is marked by thirst and sweating from the head; if heat accumulates, the urine becomes thick and the abdomen distends, while if blood accumulates, the urine is clear and the lower abdomen feels tightly bound. The classics state that damp heat intermingling results in jaundice in the populace.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>&quot;Jaundice refers to yellowing, resulting from the condition of having excessive yang without yin. Although the yellowing from cold damage varies, it is all due to internal heat caused by the improper use of warming medicines, or from excessive fire attack, or from losing sweat and purging, leading to heat in the Yangming channel that manifests as true color on the skin, known as ‘stagnation heat resulting in jaundice.’ Symptoms include sweating, thirst, and poor urination, with bright yellow color; treatments include Yin Chen decoction, Yin Chen Three-Ingredient Decoction, and Tao’s Yin Chen Decoction.</p>
<p>For those with damp-heat causing jaundice, symptoms include body pain, fever, and dark yellow color; the treatment is Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder. For those with cold damp causing jaundice, it indicates the presence of cold damp inside as a complication of the Taiyang disease; if sweating is excessive, the cold will dissipate but damp will remain; thus, the treatment is Ma Huang, Lian Qiao, and Chi Xiao Dou Decoction.</p>
<p>If body pain and nasal congestion are present, swiftly employ the method of using the watermelon seed husk to treat the nose, alongside internal administration of Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder. If there is severe headache, add Yin Chen to Shen Zhu San.</p>
<p>For jaundice caused by middle dampness, symptoms include total body pain; excessive sweating results in both eyes and skin turning yellow. Treatments include Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder, Zhi Zi and Huang Bo Decoction, and Fang Ji and Huang Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>For those with bodily discomfort and pain, administer Ma Huang Decoction with the addition of Cao Zhu.&quot;<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If there is a yellowing of the skin accompanied by symptoms such as easy hunger, dry nose, abdominal pain, tidal fever, and cough, the prescription is Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Yin Chen. For severe cases, use Da Chai Hu Decoction to purge it. </p>
<p>For alternating chills and fever, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Shan Zhi and Yin Chen. </p>
<p>If there is internal injury with cold causing yellowing, where the spleen and stomach are inherently weak, or if cold food has caused stagnation, or if there are symptoms of vomiting, fullness in the abdomen, or diarrhea, use Li Zhong Tang with Yin Chen, Zhi Shi, and Qing Pi. For abdominal distension and an inability to eat well, leading to a desire for jaundice, use Wu Ling San with Yin Chen. </p>
<p>For cases of yin syndrome with yellowing, where the limbs are cold and the pulse is deep, or when yin is excessively manifesting and causing restlessness, use Si Ni Tang with Yin Chen. </p>
<p>For cases of constricted chest leading to yellowing, with a feeling of fullness and pressure in the heart and chest that is painful to touch, use Da Xian Xiong Tang with Yin Chen. </p>
<p>For cases of Qi stagnation leading to yellowing, where there is fullness and pressure below the heart that is not painful to touch, use Ban Xia Xie Xin Tang with Yin Chen; once the Qi is resolved, the yellowing will self-cure. </p>
<p>Generally, yellowing is similar to the treatment of dampness; in mild cases, use methods to promote drainage and harmonize; in severe cases, rely on strong diuretics and laxatives, and the yellowing will recede.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Not only is there no pulse at the inch (the pulse point), and the breath through the nose is cold, indicating untreatable conditions, but the body also appears to be deformed, blackened like it has been smoked, shaking the head with a direct gaze, and the ring around the mouth is dark. The sweat is soft and yellow, indicating that the spleen qi is completely depleted. </p>
<p>For those who initially turn yellow, first hold water in the mouth, add a bit of powdered gourd stem into the nose, and spit out the yellow water. Internally take Yinchen Wuling Powder or wine-steamed Huanglian Pills, and externally apply fresh ginger pounded with Yinchen over the entire body.</p>
<p>All cases of jaundice are due to insufficient urination. Only the yellow caused by stagnant blood allows for smooth urination, and this is accompanied by both stagnant blood and exterior heat symptoms, indicated by sweating on the head, thirst, and a floating, rapid pulse. However, when heat is confined to the lower burner, it consumes body fluids leading to poor urination, while blood stagnation in the lower burner consumes blood but not body fluids, hence urination remains smooth. Treatment is detailed in the section on stagnant blood syndrome in the blood door.</p>
<p>For treating jaundice, when there is an exterior pattern, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can cause mild sweating; if the exterior is weak with strong internal symptoms, use Yinchen Wuling Powder for drainage; if it is half exterior and half interior, combine Zhi Zi and Huang Bai Decoction, Yinchen Three-Material Decoction, or Yiqing Decoction; if there is a sense of urgency in the abdomen, use Yinchen Decoction.</p>
<p>Among these, the method of drainage is particularly effective, universally utilizing Wuling Powder. If there is much dampness, increase the amount of Yinchen, for food accumulation add Sanleng, Ezhu, Sharen, and Shenqu; for heat increase the use of Qin, Lian, and Caolongdan; if there is poor urination add Shan Zhi; for a weak stomach combine Pingwei Powder removing Houpo, and add Yinchen, Huanglian, Shan Zhi, Fangi, and Zhishi.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Medical Essentials</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Yellowing</strong></p>
<p>Fever, whole body painful, face and complexion yellow, with humidity in the sun. Use a decoction of Forsythia and red beans. If the heat persists and blood stagnates internally, causing yellowing, with slight difficulty in urination, use a decoction of Ephedra, Forsythia, and red beans. If there are alternating chills and fever with persistent pain and yellowing, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Gardenia. Fever with sweating, thirst for water, smooth urination, quick defecation, and yellowing, use Wu Ling San with Yin Chen. If urination is difficult, limbs heavy, resembling malaria, with no desire to drink, use Yin Chen Wu Ling San. If cold damages the pulse, urination normal but changes to dark yellow, use Li Zhong Decoction with Yin Chen. If purging is excessive, leading to spleen deficiency and consumption of fluids, water intake can further harm, this represents transformation into damp yellow, use Yin Chen Fu Ling Decoction or Yin Chen Si Ni Decoction. </p>
<p>Note that yellow refers to the color of the central earth element, hence jaundice is often related to the Taiyin spleen channel. If the spleen cannot manage dampness and is further afflicted by heat, it then stagnates and produces yellowing. This can be likened to a damp object meeting summer heat, compounded by covering, leading to the conflict of damp heat, consequently resulting in yellowing.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>However, dampness and heat have their distinctions: dampness-related jaundice is a dark yellow, while heat-related jaundice is a bright and lustrous yellow. There is also deficiency cold of the spleen and kidneys, with a pulse that is deep and thin, a cold body with spontaneous sweating, and diarrhea with pale urine; this is known as yin jaundice, treated with Yin Chen Jiang Fu decoction, Li Zhong decoction, or Ba Wei pill. If sweating stains the clothing and is the color of bitter juice, this is called yellow sweat, treated with Huang Qi decoction or Qi Shao Gui Ku wine decoction. If there is an exterior condition, the pulse is superficial; sweating it out will lead to recovery, treated with Gui Zhi plus Huang Qi decoction. If there is an interior condition, there will be abdominal distension; resolving it will bring relief, treated with Da Huang Xie Shi decoction. Food damage is referred to as grain jaundice, treated with Fu Ling, Yin Chen, and Zhi Zi decoction. Alcohol damage is referred to as wine jaundice, treated with Ge Hua Jie Cheng decoction plus Yin Chen leaves. If a woman is overworked, there may be urgency of the bladder with spontaneous urination, slight sweating with a dark forehead, and heat in the hands and feet, treated with added Four Gentlemen Decoction or Dong Yuan Shen Jaundice Decoction. In summary, the primary method for jaundice is to clear heat and drain dampness, using Fu Ling Shen Shi decoction. If the illness is prolonged, resulting in spleen deficiency and a thin stomach, it must be addressed with Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction with Ren Shen and Bai Zhu.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Jaundice Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Law</strong> [Qing Dynasty by Yu Chang]</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>The Classics say: &quot;Those who urinate yellow and red, and can lie quietly, have jaundice.&quot; Urinating yellow and red indicates dampness, while being calm and fond of lying down also indicates dampness. Therefore, there are methods for opening the Ghost Gate and purifying the Rectum. Opening the Ghost Gate allows heat to leak through the surface of the skin via sweat. Purifying the Rectum releases dampness through urination. This clarifies the fundamental principles of diagnosis and treatment, with intricate details found only in the “Classic of the Gold Coffer.” </p>
<p>It is essential to understand that the yellowing caused by external factors is fully elaborated in the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; particularly in the Yangming chapter. Though the &quot;Classic of the Gold Coffer&quot; mentions both external and internal causes of jaundice, it emphasizes the importance of internal injuries. Here, I will elaborate for future learners.</p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of the Gold Coffer&quot; discusses jaundice resulting from internal heat stagnation caused by external pathogens, stating: &quot;The pulse at the cun position is floating and slow; floating indicates wind, and slow indicates stasis. Stasis is not true wind, but the limbs feel heavy and there is a yellowish complexion, resulting from stagnant heat.&quot; This means that the interaction of wind and dampness in cold damage leads to this manifestation; although wind is generally good at mobilizing, when it combines with dampness, it becomes stagnant and does not move, resulting only in heat stagnation.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>When the condition of the liver reaches its extreme, the nature of wind begins to emerge. The wind consequently carries the stagnant heat to the limbs, causing them to feel troubled, revealing the signs of wind-induced minor ailments. It also carries the stagnant heat to the skin, causing a yellowish hue, which indicates the signs of dampness penetrating from the outside. The pulse is superficial due to the wind generating heat, and weak because of dampness causing obstruction. </p>
<p>At this point, the methods from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; should be employed to open the pathways and cleanse the body, allowing the heat carried by the wind to be released from the surface of the skin, and the damp yellow to be expelled through urination, thereby clarifying the distinction between the exterior and interior.</p>
<p>The &quot;Synopsis of Golden Coffer&quot; mentions that when a Yangming disease does not resolve after exposure to cold, it may result in a condition known as grain stagnation. If the pulse is slow, eating becomes difficult, leading to fullness; fullness results in agitation, dizziness, and difficulty urinating. This indicates an impending condition of grain stagnation. Even with treatment, the abdomen remains distended, which is attributed to the pulse being slow. The lingering heat in the Yangming stomach from external sources remains present, complicating digestion. When full, the food generates further heat, and the combination of the two heats leads to agitation, dizziness, difficulty in urination, and abdominal distension, making it inevitable.</p>
<p>In the case of Yangming syndrome, one should typically purge, especially if there is significant abdominal distension. However, in this specific scenario, purging will not alleviate the distension; rather, it may increase discomfort. This is due to the pulse being slow and the stomach being empty, with fluids not being sufficient. The fullness is merely a manifestation of internal excess heat, not an accumulation of solid heat in need of purging.</p>
<p>The repetition of this principle in the &quot;Synopsis of Golden Coffer&quot; carries profound meaning, indicating that when the pulse is slow and the stomach is weak, purging is not only ineffective but the methods to open the pathways and cleanse the body will also prove useless, which goes without saying.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>I remember a friend once asked: Zhang Zhongjing said that if the lower abdomen is still full as before, why not establish a treatment method? I replied: Zhang Zhongjing must use harmonizing methods. First harmonize internally, and only then can one purge it. My friend asked: How do you know this? I said: Zhang Zhongjing states that if the pulse is slow, it is not yet time to attack. The meaning of &quot;harmonizing&quot; clearly indicates the intention to resolve it. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; also says that for those with yellow abdominal pain and vomiting, one should use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. Observing this, it still treats the evil of cold damage causing high pain below, hence leading to vomiting. The sweet decoction of Xiao Chai is the method for this, which is why I know. Chen Wuzhe treated food stasis with a decoction of malt and bitter orange combined with Xiao Chai Hu, slightly recognizing this principle. However, using half of each method—half resolving, half harmonizing, and half purging—all together without order, is far from the meticulous approach of Zhang Zhongjing. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; also states: When the pulse at the foot yang is tight and rapid, rapid indicates heat, and heat causes food to not digest; tightness indicates cold, and fullness arises from food. A floating pulse at the chi position indicates kidney damage, while a tight pulse at the foot yang indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold clash, eating grain leads to dizziness. If the grain energy does not dissipate, it causes bitter and turbid conditions in the stomach, with turbid qi flowing down, leading to obstructed urination. The cold affects the yin, heat flows into the bladder, and the body turns completely yellow; this condition is called food stasis. This discussion on internal injury causing yellowing is truly an unprecedented marvel. Dong Yuan&#39;s &quot;Discussion on the Spleen and Stomach&quot; somewhat resembles one-tenth of this, and later generations delight in the sect, disregarding the profound meanings of the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; which is truly lamentable.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Please elaborate! The human body’s spleen and stomach reside in the central region. The spleen, representing the earth, is Yin in nature but functions as Yang; the stomach, representing the earth, is Yang in nature but functions as Yin. When these two are harmonized, neither too rigid nor too yielding exists. The stomach receives food, while the spleen processes the essence of grains, regulating the waterways and nourishing the various channels, achieving great utility. However, the seven emotions, along with hunger, fullness, and exertion, when excessive, cause internal harm, leading to a disharmony between the Yin and Yang of the spleen and stomach. If the stomach leans towards Yang without the Yin of the spleen to harmonize it, it is akin to nature experiencing summer without winter, accumulating heat alone and digesting grains inadequately. If the spleen leans towards Yin without the Yang of the stomach to harmonize it, it is like nature undergoing winter without summer, accumulating cold alone and leading to bloating. Those having a tense and rapid pulse in the Yang veins will surely exhibit clear signs. Diagnosing whether the pulse is tense or rapid reveals that the spleen and stomach govern the illness. If both tense and rapid, it indicates that the spleen and stomach share in the affliction, as the principle states accurately. Yet, there is a deeper understanding. If the pulse in both wrists is floating, it also suggests damage to the kidneys. The kidney pulse is inherently deep, so why is it floating? This is because the kidneys store essence, and essence is produced from grains. If the spleen fails to transport what’s in the stomach, the grain essence enters the kidneys, leading to a lack of nourishment for the essence and resultant kidney damage, which causes the deep pulse to become floating. Knowing the floating pulse in the wrists indicates kidney harm leads to the understanding that the tense Yang pulse indicates spleen injury. However, tension pertains to the liver pulse, aligning with what Zhongjing stated—that tension is like a bowstring. When the spleen pulse is loose, and it is affected by the liver wood’s overgrowth, it becomes tense.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The wind from the liver, combined with the coldness from the spleen, clash with each other, causing dizziness upon consuming grains. When grains enter and cannot thrive in the stomach&#39;s yang, they instead generate wind in the spleen&#39;s yin. The heat that gathers in the stomach and dissipates the grains merely turns them into a putrid, turbid qi, rather than pure essence. This turbid qi flows down from the stomach&#39;s heat into the bladder, resulting in heat obstructing the bladder&#39;s function, leading to difficulty in urination and a yellow complexion throughout the body. If the turbid qi flows down from the spleen&#39;s cold into the kidneys, the kidneys will be affected by this cold, and their excess will cause abdominal fullness. Ultimately, the condition of grain stagnation most often arises from stomach heat harming the bladder, while only about two or three in ten cases stem from spleen cold harming the kidneys. If food injures the spleen and is compounded by sexual exhaustion damaging the kidneys, the symptoms will inevitably lead to abdominal fullness that is difficult to treat. Zhongjing reiterated the principle regarding female conditions and abdominal heaviness, stating: &quot;The abdomen is water-like and untreated.&quot; Is this not profoundly clear? </p>
<p>For female conditions of abdominal heaviness, the forehead appears dark, indicating a yellow body with an additional dark forehead. Black, as a color of the north&#39;s darkness, added to the brightness of the south, signifies that there must first be turbid qi from stomach heat and spleen cold flowing down to the kidneys, compounded by excessive female labor, leading to this condition; its origins are not from just one day. The &quot;Zhouhou&quot; text suggests that this can be caused by intercourse leading to fluid accumulation, with some evidence to support this.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>When fire burns through firewood, the forehead&#39;s color turns black; although it does not enter water, can it be avoided? Therefore, the turbid gas within the spleen descends and enters the kidneys, the colors of water and earth reveal themselves, but in the yellow there is only black stagnation. If the fire of the heart rises from the water and joins with the sovereign fire of the heart, its force can spread like wildfire, the smoke and flames first manifest on the forehead, to the point where even a slight sweat will emerge from there, causing the heart&#39;s fluid to be drained. The heat in the hands and feet is the same; the internal injuries are just as dire. At dusk, when yangming is at work, yangming governs closure and gathers the damp heat of the entire body, hastily descending, the bladder consequently gives urgent signals, with smooth urination, and dark stools signify a retention of blood in the bladder. The abdomen appears water-like, but it is not water; it specifically refers to the retention of blood, hence it is not treated. </p>
<p>Alcoholic stagnation creates heat and bitterness in the heart, causing inability to eat and occasional urges to vomit. Alcohol is the most detrimental of damp and heat, as its energy returns to the heart and lungs, its taste is attributed to the spleen and stomach. When the heat accumulates for a long time, if it does not descend but instead rises, it leads to bitterness and blockage in the middle jiao, resulting in an inability to eat. If the damp heat does not descend but rises, it causes vomiting. When vomiting occurs, the direction reverses and accumulates throughout the body. </p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; states that if yangming disease has no sweating, if urination is not smooth, and if there is bitterness in the heart, the body is sure to turn yellow. This indicates that if the heat within is intense, it can lead to this condition, and it is not solely due to alcohol. </p>
<p>The &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; states regarding the treatment of alcoholic stagnation, using methods of either inducing vomiting or purging, that alcoholic yellow stagnation will surely lead to unsmooth urination, with heat felt in the heart and heat in the feet being the symptoms.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>It is also said: If there is no heat but clear speech, fullness in the abdomen with a desire to vomit, and a dark nose, then one should first induce vomiting for those with a floating pulse, and first purge for those with a deep and taut pulse. Additionally, if there is heat in the heart causing nausea, vomiting will bring relief. Furthermore, if there is vexation in the heart or heat causing pain, the prescription of Gardenia and Rhubarb decoction should be used. Moreover, if purging leads to prolonged black stool, this indicates a deeper issue. Although words may be expressed differently, the meaning is consistent.</p>
<p>When the heat from alcohol accumulates in the bladder, the qi cannot flow, which leads to difficulty in urination; if it accumulates in the upper burner, it causes heat in the heart; if it accumulates in the lower burner, it causes heat in the feet. If there is no heat in the heart or feet, and the speech is clear and the spirit is not clouded, but there is fullness in the abdomen, a desire to vomit, and dark nasal discharge, it indicates a mixed disorder of yin and yang in the stomach and abdomen.</p>
<p>Treatment must be sequentially divided, distinguishing between the floating and deep pulses to determine whether to induce vomiting or to purge first. A floating pulse indicates disease in the upper burner, with more yang present, so one should first induce vomiting for fullness in the upper burner and then treat the fullness in the middle. A deep and taut pulse indicates disease in the abdomen, with more yin present, so one should first alleviate the fullness in the middle and then treat the upper burner.</p>
<p>However, if the heat in the heart leads to a desire to vomit, the issue is entirely in the upper burner. Inducing vomiting will provide relief, so why focus on purging? If heat from alcohol causes inner binding, leading to confusion of the spirit and feelings of vexation and pain, then purging is necessary. But purging is a method that depletes the disease, and should not be used for long. If purged excessively over time, it will inevitably damage the yang qi of the spleen and lungs, preventing them from regulating the yin blood, which may lead to a deterioration of the blood that eventually turns black.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Have I ever suggested that the lower methods can be used inappropriately? Zhang Zhongjing arranged the treatment of alcoholic intoxication in a specific sequence, indicating the meticulousness of his approach.</p>
<p>The darkness of alcoholic intoxication differs significantly from that of female labor intoxication. The darkness from female labor arises from kidney qi, while that from alcohol reflects the corrupted color of vital blood. The &quot;vital&quot; refers to the essence of water and grains, which becomes stagnant due to damp heat, turning its brilliance into dullness. The chest feels tumultuous like chewing garlic, and its sweet flavor transforms to sour and spicy. Moreover, the skin becomes insensate to touch, the stools are notably dark, and the pulse is weak and floating—all indicating a blockage of lung qi and stagnation of blood.</p>
<p>To restore the clear and purifying qi of the lungs is necessary to drive out the impure blood within the vital essence. This condition is relatively easier to treat than female labor intoxication. The prescriptions merely recommend the use of Baizhu Decoction to regulate spleen qi and resolve the heat of alcohol; what an inept approach!</p>
<p>Hypertension arises from the heat and dampness of fire and earth. If it coincides with the dryness of the Yangming channel, the combination of these three opposing energies produces a yellow coloration in the individual, who will inevitably experience thirst and drink water. In this case, one must enhance the moistening and drying herbs within the damp-heat formulas to achieve proper transformation and flow of fluids in the three burners, thereby alleviating thirst and eliminating the yellow hue. If thirst persists, it indicates that dryness has not yet been resolved, but it is not a terminal condition. Why, then, is it said that thirst associated with intoxication is difficult to treat? </p>
<p>This raises further concern about the depletion of lower sources, not just the body fluids within. </p>
<p>This is the guiding principle.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>In cases of jaundice caused by external factors, mistakenly using tonifying methods is known as &quot;true excess,&quot; and it is the physician’s fault. In cases of jaundice caused by internal injury, mistakenly using purging methods is known as &quot;true deficiency,&quot; and it is the physician’s fault. When the jaundice manifests from yin, treating it as if it were yang, and wrongly applying bitter and cold treatments, resulting in extreme severity from which there is no return, the physician is guilty of killing the patient. </p>
<p>For yin jaundice with no fever and aversion to cold, with spontaneous urination, a pulse that is slow and faint, if one erroneously opens the gates of ghosts, the skin will become cold and sweat will persist unceasingly. If one mistakenly purifies the organs, the bladder will lose control over urination, leading to an imminent death, not to mention the grave mistake of inducing vomiting or diarrhea. Even using mild and beneficial medicines to prolong life is merely a method leading to waiting for death. </p>
<p>In cases that are half yin and half yang, one must first retreat the yin and expose the yang. Once the yin retreats, then one treats with yang methods. If aconite and coptis are used together, it will certainly be harmful. How could one use bitter and cold treatments on purely yin conditions without any yang?<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Jaundice, according to ancient scholars, is often attributed to damp-heat, with distinctions made among five types of jaundice, but these categorizations do not fully capture its essence. What is essential to understand about jaundice can be categorized into four types: yang jaundice, yin jaundice, exterior pathogen-induced jaundice, and gallbladder jaundice. Understanding these four types exhausts the discussion on jaundice.</p>
<p>Danxi stated that jaundice does not necessarily have to be divided into five types; it is all damp-heat, akin to the similarity of curving in nature. Can we truly say that all such instances are merely damp-heat? This is insufficient as evidence. I foolishly categorize them as follows:</p>
<p>Yang jaundice occurs when excessive dampness leads to heat; heat then produces jaundice, which is what we call a damp-heat syndrome. However, its symptoms must include fever, thirst, restlessness, increased appetite, or signs of painful and burning urination, or constipation. Its pulse will be strong and slippery. This condition does not strictly adhere to exterior or interior influences; it can arise from either external wind-dampness or internal injury from food and drink. Yet, if one observes that the vital energy remains strong and the spleen and stomach are not harmed, while damp-heat is indeed severe, the correct approach is to clear the heat and promote urination. Once the damp-heat is eliminated, the jaundice will diminish. Treating this condition is not difficult.</p>
<p>Yin jaundice, on the other hand, is entirely different from damp-heat and originates from the failure of blood and qi.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The essence does not generate blood, and thus blood fails; blood does not manifest color, and hence color fails. In cases of jaundice where there is absolutely no evidence of Yang symptoms or Yang pulse, it indicates Yin jaundice. What causes the illness of Yin jaundice? It must be due to the disturbance of the seven emotions affecting the organs, or fatigue harming the body, leading to a great depletion of central Qi, causing the spleen to fail in its function of transforming blood. Consequently, the color of the spleen&#39;s earth phase is revealed externally. In this condition, the patient prefers rest and dislikes movement, seeks darkness and fears brightness. Symptoms include mental fatigue, slight speech, possible dizziness and vertigo, aversion to cold and reduced appetite, weakness in the limbs, or unformed stools and urine like oil, along with a weak pulse—these are all signs of Yang deficiency. This stands in contrast to jaundice caused by damp-heat, which is like ice versus fire; if the original Qi is not quickly restored and the spleen and kidneys are not significantly nourished, there is no possibility of recovery. Additionally, these cases are most common; if one sees only yellow coloration without assessing pulse and symptoms, and hastily concludes it is jaundice, treating it as damp-heat with herbs like gardenia or gentian to clear heat and promote urination, there will inevitably be fatal outcomes following the treatment. The yellowing from exterior pathogens is actually a sign of a cold damage syndrome. In cases where cold damage leads to sweating that cannot penetrate and wind-damp is present on the surface, there can be yellow symptoms; or if the exterior pathogen is unresolved, transmitting internally and damp-heat is constrained in the Yangming, yellow symptoms can also occur.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Those who have not resolved the external邪 will definitely experience fever, body pain, floating pulse, and slight sweating; they should be treated by inducing sweat to disperse the邪. For those with internal damp-heat stagnation, there will necessarily be irritability, a slow and slippery pulse, and profuse sweating; they should be treated by clearing and eliminating the dampness and heat. If there is a real邪 pressing on the Yangming, causing fullness and distension, treatment should first focus on purging it, and then clearing away the residual heat to ensure complete recovery.</p>
<p>As for yellow bile syndrome, it occurs with great fright or injury from fighting. I have seen cases where someone, terrified by a tiger or wolf, lost courage suddenly and fell ill with yellowness; such cases develop rapidly. There are also cases caused by harsh officials or fears of disaster, where constant terror leads to gradual illness; such cases develop more slowly. During the 11th year of the Yongming era in the Qi dynasty, a student named Wei Zhun died from excessive fright, his whole body turned blue, and people believed it was due to a broken gallbladder, exemplifying this phenomenon. I have also observed cases of yellowness developing gradually after brawls, caused by gallbladder injury. The symptoms are characterized by absence of fire and dampness, with patients feeling lethargic and drowsy, and their complexion appearing a uniform yellow as if dyed. All of these symptoms stem from gallbladder injury; when the gallbladder is harmed, its energy is depleted, leading to leakage of bile, hence the manifestation of these symptoms. The text states: when bile leaks, it causes a bitter mouth, and when stomach energy is reversed, it leads to bitter vomiting; thus, it is called vomiting bile, reflecting the same principle.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>The gallbladder is linked to the liver, governing the vital energy of the lesser yang in spring. Where there is life, there is growth; where there is none, there is death. Hence it is said in the classics that all eleven organs depend on the gallbladder, for the vital energy within the gallbladder is the source of all transformations. If any of these conditions arise from harm to the gallbladder, then the vital energy is depleted. Once the vital energy is depleted, how can it produce life? Therefore, those suffering from these ailments often lead to dire consequences. However, if one examines the subtlety of the energy closely and acts quickly to restore the foundation, recovery is still possible. The authority of mending the heavens with stone is in the hands of those skilled in medicine.</p>
<p>Regarding jaundice, there are ancient distinctions of five types: Yellow Sweat, Yellow Jaundice, Grain Jaundice, Wine Jaundice, and Women&#39;s Labor Jaundice. In summary, if sweat soaks clothing, resembling the color of barberry juice, it is called Yellow Sweat; if the body, face, and eyes turn golden yellow, with yellow urine and without sweating, it is Yellow Jaundice; if it arises due to dietary harm to the spleen, it is Grain Jaundice; if caused by dampness from alcohol consumption, it is Wine Jaundice; if due to desires harming the yin, it is Women&#39;s Labor Jaundice. Although they have such distinctions, they ultimately fall into the categories of yin and yang. Generally, yang conditions are more solid, while yin conditions tend to be more deficient. Understanding this distinction between deficiency and excess captures the essence.</p>
<p>Difficult-to-treat jaundice conditions include: no pulse at the wrist, cold sweat at the nose, a body resembling one smudged by smoke, unsteady head with fixed gaze, dark black around the mouth, yellow oily sweat, and a long-term blackening of the skin—all of which are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Yang jaundice is often caused by dampness in the spleen leading to obstructed heat. It is essential to clear the fire and resolve dampness; when fire is cleared, urination will improve, and when urination improves, the jaundice will recede. For mild cases, prescriptions such as Yin Chen drink, Da Fen Qing drink, or Zhi Zi Ban Pi decoction are appropriate. If there is severe blockage with intense heat, manifesting as difficulty in urination and abdominal fullness, the treatment should include Yin Chen Hao decoction or Zhi Zi Da Huang decoction.</p>
<p>Yin jaundice, on the other hand, is often due to internal injury and insufficiency. One should not focus solely on clearing; it is important to tonify and replenish the heart, spleen, and kidneys to nurture blood and qi. When blood and qi are restored, the jaundice will surely fade. Key formulas include Si Jun Zi decoction, Wu Jun Zi drink, Shou Pi decoction, and Wen Wei drink, which are essential for the heart and spleen. If there is yang deficiency within the yin, remedies like Liu Wei Wan, Ba Wei Wan, Wu Fu drink, Li Yin decoction, as well as Zuo Gui and You Gui formulas are indicated. If the original qi is insufficient but there is considerable cold dampness, then formulas like Wu Ling San, Si Ling San, or variations of Yin Chen Wu Ling San can also be used with appropriate adjustments.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In cases of cold-damage with jaundice, when the exterior pathogen has not cleared and there is a predominance of damp-heat, the symptoms will manifest both on the surface and internally. Treatment should aim to resolve both aspects, recommended formulas include Chai Ling Decoction or Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder; if internal heat is severe while the exterior pathogen remains, Chai Ling Decoction is indicated. If there is only internal damp-heat leading to fullness and obstruction without external pathogen, Yin Chen Hao Decoction should be used. If jaundice occurs due to internal injury from fatigue, there will often be symptoms of jaundice, but if there&#39;s no evidence of internal damp-heat or pathogens, it is essential to use methods for yin jaundice to tonify and treat, possibly employing the method of Han Zhi as well. Merely attacking the pathogen without careful consideration will not lead to success. Therefore, Master Sun states: when jaundice is coupled with a floating pulse, it should be resolved with sweating, using Gui Zhi with Huang Qi Decoction. This exemplifies the method of supplementing the deficient and dispersing pathogens. External symptoms of cold damage should be thoroughly examined as well. The yellow bile condition is always due to liver damage. Once the liver suffers harm, the loss of the organ&#39;s qi becomes apparent; without restoration, rupture is inevitable. Thus, in the presence of such symptoms, it is essential to use generous amounts of warm sweet remedies to rapidly restore vital energy.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>One must investigate the root causes, whether to combine sourness to recover from dispersal and decline, or to combine thickening to stabilize from emptiness and collapse, or to combine weight to calm the unsettled spirit and soul, or to clarify paths and benefits to resolve unresolved doubts and fears. Generally, in medical practices, it is advisable to follow the treatment methods for Yin Jaundice, in order to obtain favorable results. If one treats this condition while further enforcing excessive measures, it&#39;s truly akin to pressing on an egg.</p>
<p>The treatment for Jaundice fundamentally should clear dampness and promote urination, although there are many cases not suitable for such measures, as discussed in detail in the treatise on dampness conditions.</p>
<p>Han Zhihe commented: If a patient takes excessive medication for three to five days, it weakens their spleen and stomach, depletes their bodily fluids, causing thirst for water, while the spleen soil becomes dampened and meets with evil heat to result in Jaundice. This is Yin Jaundice, and it should be treated with warming medicines. If the pulse in both hands is deep, thin, and slow, the limbs are cold, the skin develops bumps, or there is vomiting with a coating on the tongue, widespread yellowness, restlessness with a desire to lie in muddy water, and scanty, red urination, these are all signs of Yin conditions. Therefore, Yin Jaundice is often warmed with hot broth, or a cloth soaked in broth is applied to the chest and abdomen, or hot broth is held in a ladle and placed under the navel for fomentation.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Those who recover from this illness often have been treated for Zhao Xianzong’s cold damage lasting six or seven days. Due to excessive medication, they develop jaundice. Their pulse is deep, thin, slow, and weak, their skin is cool, their hair is frizzy, they desire to lie in mud, they experience wheezing and vomiting, and their urine is red and clouded. Initially, I prescribed a decoction of artemisia and dried orange peel, which alleviated the wheezing and vomiting; then, half a dose of the small artemisia decoction was given, and their pulse slightly improved, reducing the desire to lie in mud. The next day, half a dose of the artemisia and aconite decoction was administered, their limbs became warm, they urinated two to three liters, and they sweated profusely on that day, resulting in recovery. Cases like this are too numerous to list individually. </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage with jaundice, it is often associated with the celestial bodies of the sun or the moon. If purged excessively, it often turns to a severe jaundice. The presence of the Chen and Xu (the hours of the day associated with the sun) indicates cold water in charge, which invades the earth; for the Chou and Wei (the hours associated with the moon), damp earth is in charge, leading to insufficient earth energy, resulting in spleen and stomach weakness. This allows water to invade, frequently resulting in this condition.</p>
<p>Jaundice from cold damage often arises from damp heat. Symptoms may include difficulty with small urination, either yellow or red urine, a distended but painless lower abdomen, or firm stools with extreme thirst. The pulse is deep, solid, and strong, indicating damp heat. For mild cases, a formula of artemisia and five grain dispersal may be sufficient; for severe cases, the artemisia decoction can be used to promote urination, clear the blood, and eliminate heat, thus causing the jaundice to recede. However, there are also cases of yin jaundice with different treatment methods; these are detailed above and should be referred to accordingly.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescriptions of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Jaundice</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of jaundice include yellowing of the entire body and eyes, which indicates a death sentence. However, if treated at the onset, it may not necessarily lead to death. I possess a remarkable formula called the Decoction to Eliminate Jaundice and Resolve Dampness. It consists of three qian of Artemisia, three liang each of Job&#39;s tears and Plantago seeds, two liang of Poria, and three fen of cinnamon, which is to be boiled and consumed. After four doses, the jaundice will disappear and the dampness will resolve.  </p>
<p>Although jaundice arises from damp heat, the root cause is ultimately a deficiency of the spleen that fails to regulate and eliminate water and dampness, resulting in stagnation and jaundice. I prescribe large doses of Poria, Job&#39;s tears, and Plantago as the chief ingredients to dispel water dampness while also being fortifying for the spleen and qi; a small amount of Artemisia is used to resolve damp heat, and the cinnamon is included to guide it to the bladder for elimination through urination, subtly addressing the damp heat in the process. This formula is both light and exquisite, simple yet miraculous.  </p>
<p>After the first four doses, reduce the amount by half and add one liang of Atractylodes, then brew and drink. Use another four doses, and they will recover completely without subsequent issues. The symptoms of jaundice should generally not lead to death.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If treatment methods are not correct, it often transforms life into death. Indeed, jaundice caused by external dampness is easily treated, while those from internal injury are difficult to heal. In cases of external dampness, simply treating the dampness can lead to the recovery from jaundice, whereas treating internal injury solely for dampness makes recovery from jaundice challenging. Purging water diminishes vital energy, and inducing sweat causes loss of essence. How can one expect a rapid recovery from jaundice?</p>
<p>I have a remedy that treats internal injury causing jaundice, called the Internal Dissipation Jaundice Decoction. It consists of one tael each of Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria, and Job’s tears, two qian each of Artemisia capillaris and fried Gardenia fruit, and five fen of dried tangerine peel, all boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this prescription lies in the abundant use of Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria, and Job’s tears, which strengthen the spleen and facilitate water metabolism, assisting Artemisia capillaris and Gardenia fruit in dissipating dampness and heat, all from within the bladder, without the need to additionally expel the dampness from the skin, which will resolve itself. Generally, using this formula for ten doses will result in complete dissipation; it is not necessary to exceed ten doses. After ten doses, reduce to half, eliminate the Gardenia fruit, and take five more doses for full recovery; the person will be strong and vigorous. This is a remarkably effective and miraculous remedy, beneficial and harmless, suitable for treating those with internal injury compounded by dampness.</p>

<p>&quot;The Secret Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states: Jaundice is caused by dampness lingering internally, which leads to the obstruction of the meridians. To treat this condition, first knead the back several times, then perform the opening techniques to guide the blood flow and ensure connection between the internal and external. Afterwards, using the palms, press beneath the breasts and rub several dozen times until a sound resembling dripping is heard from the lower abdomen. </p>
<p>In cases of damp-related illness, the color may appear yellowish-black and swollen. Utilize heat to apply to the lower abdomen several times, followed by the opening techniques, allowing sweat to emerge and dampness to dissipate.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Family Care&quot; states: In Caizhai, there was a boy of fifteen years old, suffering from jaundice for a year. His face was as yellow as gold, his body swollen and weak, and he could only eat salt and burnt food. A practitioner used tea to mix a powder, which made him vomit a bowl of phlegm. Later, in the evening, he took seven to eight pills of a certain medicine and three qian of another mixture, which he expelled in four to five actions. After waiting six to seven days, he took more pills and another mixture, expelling four to five actions again. He began to detest salt and burnt food, and his complexion turned red. Afterwards, he used tea to induce vomiting again, bringing out two sheng of phlegm, which finally led to his recovery.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a man who developed a lump while suffering from jaundice. He had a good appetite but was thin, unable to lift his limbs, and his face was yellow and weak. His mother-in-law wanted to abandon him, but his daughter refused, saying: &quot;I have already borne two sons; how can I marry another?&quot; The mother-in-law, who was originally a farmer, wanted her son-in-law to work hard, but seeing his severe illness, she scolded him daily. People suggested he take gallbladder pills and a mixture with three angles, but they were of no help. Acupuncture and spells brought no relief either. </p>
<p>A practitioner saw him and treated him without diagnosis, administering an expelling agent that removed a斗 (about 10 liters) of stagnant phlegm and water. He then prescribed a laxative pill and another mixture, causing him to expel four to five dozen times. The practitioner ordered him to drink a bowl of ice water, which immediately stopped the expulsion. He next took a remedy for the stomach and intermittently took betel nut pills. After five to seven days, his yellow complexion faded and strength returned. The symptoms of jaundice from the spleen were due to damp heat clashing with accumulated food, commonly referred to as &quot;food labor jaundice.&quot;<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>Zhu, Ge, Zhou, Huang, and Liu, the three families, each had a servant afflicted with jaundice. Dairen said: &quot;In the role of servants, their diet and exposure to cold and heat, as well as wind, summer, dampness, and cold, often cause such ailments. It is difficult to treat and manage, resulting in wasted efforts.&quot; Thus, two families kept their servants at Dairen&#39;s place, following his dietary recommendations. One servant did not leave his master and continued to work. The three of them all took Ku Shen powder to induce vomiting and then took Sanhua Shenyuan pills to assist digestion. Within five days, indeed, two servants recovered while one did not, as predicted.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Yuyuan of Anxi became ill with widespread yellowing of the skin and sought a physician&#39;s advice. The doctor said: &quot;You have the Yangming disease; you and others have trained under Zhang Dairen, discussing the taking of Dahuang, so it&#39;s difficult for us to talk about this illness.&quot; Mr. Yuyuan was displeased, believing he had no other illness, and took eighty Sanhua Shenyuan pills but did not improve. He then realized: &quot;My damp heat is severe; this medicine still does not work.&quot; Using Zhou Che pills and Jun Chuan powder as remedies, he induced a major purge, resulting in significant bowel movement, and within one evening, his jaundice receded. This experience further reinforced Mr. Yuyuan&#39;s trust in Dairen&#39;s words.</p>
<p>A girl from Cai Zhai suffered from jaundice, with extreme swelling, a complexion like gold, fatigue, and a lack of appetite, only inclined to eat raw foods similar to mud and coal. Initially, a bitter agent was made into pills, inducing a bowl of phlegm; followed by Zhou Che pills and Tong Jing powder, inducing several bowel movements like ink; additionally, Daoyin pills and Mo Shi powder were used to relieve gas. Within a few days, her muscles returned to their original state.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A woman who gives birth in four months presents with a yellow complexion, fatigue in the limbs, reduced appetite, missed menstruation, occasional fever, and a taut pulse. Use one ounce of Atractylodes, half an ounce each of Ginseng, Gentian, Moutan, Rehmannia, Akebia, Bupleurum, and Peony, one dram each of Chuanxiong, Scutellaria, and Kudzu, and three-fifths of an ounce of Licorice. Prepare twelve doses, boil in water, and take hot before meals for recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; mentions: In the second month of the Bingyin year, Yuan Yan Zhengqing, due to labor from official duties and irregular eating, had heart fire troubling the spleen, and with weak spleen qi, anger and resentment injured the liver. He experienced distension in the chest, fatigue in the limbs, body numbness, jaundice appearing in the skin and eyes, slight cyanosis, a dark complexion, disturbed spirit, anxiety, a strong urge to vomit, a foul taste in the mouth, delayed digestion, and occasionally difficult urination that was red and dark. He experienced fever between the hours of Chen and Si, which subsided by evening, but intensified in April. His son, worried for his life, sought treatment and explained the situation. When the pulse was examined, it was floating and weak. The &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot; states that a floating pulse at the wrist indicates wind, while a weak pulse indicates blockage. Blockage is not due to wind stroke; the limbs suffer from restlessness, the spleen appears yellow, and there is heat and stagnation. A tense pulse at the Fuyuan point indicates spleen damage, with wind and cold colliding, leading to dizziness upon eating grains, with grain qi not digesting, bitter and turbid fluids in the stomach, turbid qi descending, difficulty in urination, yin affected by cold, heat flowing to the bladder, and the entire body appearing yellow, which is termed &quot;grain jaundice.&quot; It requires Fu Ling, Zhi Zi, and Yin Chen Decoction for treatment.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>In the sixth month of the year Bingyin during the Yuan dynasty, there was continuous rain, and many people fell ill with epidemics. Han Junxiang from Zhen Ding, due to overexertion, drank cold tea and ate cold foods, leading to a headache, pain in his limbs and joints, a feeling of heaviness in his body, fullness in his chest, and inability to eat. He believed it was an external sickness and took Tongsheng powder twice. After taking the medicine, his body felt even more fatigued, prompting him to seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>The doctor administered a hundred relief powder to induce sweating; four days later, he took Xiao Chai Hu decoction twice, but his agitation, fever, and thirst worsened. Six days later, he was given San Yi Cheng Qi decoction, exacerbating his agitation and thirst. Other prescriptions like Bai Hu decoction with ginseng and Chai Hu infusion were administered, but his condition only deteriorated. </p>
<p>He changed doctors, who prescribed Huang Lian Jie Du decoction, Zhu Sha ointment, and Zhi Bao pill among others. By the seventeenth day, the illness progressed, showing yellowing of skin and eyes, heaviness in limbs, chills in the back, cold skin, hardness and pain upon pressing the area under the heart, dry eyes that did not wish to open, a tendency to be mute, spontaneous sweating, small loose stools, and incomplete bowel movements. I was ordered to treat him, and upon examining his pulse, it was tight and thin, and when pressed felt hollow. The pulse at the two-inch point was short and inadequate. This condition arose from the combination of seasonal heat and excessive drinking of cold beverages, compounded by an overuse of cold medicines, causing the liver (wood) to overpower the heart, which in turn weakened the spleen (earth). </p>
<p>As the classics state: &quot;The one who is weak is overpowered by the one who is strong.&quot; It was the season of continuous rain, leading to a combination of cold and dampness, which manifested as a yin condition causing jaundice. I prescribed Yin Chen Fuzi Ganjiang decoction to treat him.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Cold infiltrates within; it is treated with sweet warmth, complemented by bitter and pungent agents. When dampness dominates, it must be balanced with bitter heat, diluted with mildness, and dried with bitterness. Aconite and dried ginger are strongly warm and spicy, dispersing the internal cold, thus they are used as the primary ingredients. Pinellia and cardamom are spicy and warm, while white atractylodes and aged tangerine peel are bitter, sweet, and warm, helping to strengthen the spleen and dry dampness, hence they serve as the secondary ingredients. Fresh ginger is spicy and warm to disperse, while licorice is sweet and neutral to help with infiltration. Bitter orange, being slightly cool and bitter, helps relieve fullness, while Artemisia capillaris is slightly cool and bitter, and its light nature helps; paired with ginger and aconite, it can expel cold dampness from the skin and body, thus serving as an assistant. Take one or two doses; if symptoms reduce by half, continue for complete relief. Additionally, take it with the Regulate the Middle Decoction for several days until the energy stabilizes.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Some may find it difficult to understand: Why is it thought that yellow indicates heat, and yet during the peak of summer, one uses heat-clearing medicine to treat it? I say: It is natural and must be this way. Cheng Wujǐ states: There are two types of yin syndromes: One arises from external cold pathogens injuring the yin channels, or from consuming cold food, thus harming the Taiyin channel. The second occurs when one initially contracts a yang syndrome, and then treats it with cold, which, if excessive, transforms yang into yin. Now, you have the condition of Mr. Xiang, caused by the summer heat; the consumption of cold food harms the spleen, and overindulgence in cold leads to a dominance of yin qi, with yang qi on the verge of collapse. Additionally, with the convergence of continual rain and cold humidity, it manifests as yellow. This correlates with what Zhongjing said about seeking it amid cold and damp. Li Sishun comments: To resolve it with excessive cold and coolness, or to purge it and chase out the intruder harms the host—this is precisely the case. The sages&#39; principles should not be carelessly neglected! Some might say: The study of cleanliness has been around since ancient times.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Treatise&quot; states: A woman aged sixty suffers from shivering and chills, indicating cold in the foot&#39;s solar channels; yawning and sneezing relate to the foot&#39;s lesser yang and gallbladder; lack of saliva in her mouth suggests deficiency in the foot&#39;s yang brightness; there is acute pain and fullness in the heart, with the hand&#39;s lesser yin affected by cold, and stagnation of blood in the foot&#39;s lesser yin. She feels hot but desires proximity to fire, showing heat on the skin while cold resides in the bones. There is cold and discomfort below the navel, indicating cold in the lower dantian; her whole body and eyes show yellow, a sign of cold dampness. I have confirmed this and know it to be cold. Frequent yellow, red, and dark urination denotes excessive cold dampness. When the illness causes her body to feel heavy like a mountain, she immediately lies on her bed; this indicates excess of yin dampness. The pulse at the right wrist shows a thin string at the gate of life and heartbeat; pressing reveals it is strong and string-like. A tense string signifies cold; if it is also delicate, it indicates northern cold waters; if mixed with a very slow pulse, this shows excess dampness leading to yellowish conditions. A strong and broad pulse indicates heart fire is constrained. Pressing the left wrist down to the bone and noting fullness in the hand indicates vitality in the kidneys (water). If all six pulses are empty, there is no yang present in the lower source. As for treatment, I first recommend light doses to dispel the cold dampness, while also reducing the strong pulse, using a formula combining licorice with poria cooked in water to serve cool. This addresses heat brought on by cold, using fictitious cold against the foot&#39;s solar channels&#39; false heat and applies the spicy warm properties of ginger to disperse the bladder&#39;s true qi, thus saying true against true, false against false. If there is no improvement, I would then prescribe a decoction of atractylodes and aconite. Although this condition presents with yellow and red urination, it still calls for cold treatment based on further symptom analysis and pulse examination.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>A person is suffering from body pain, their face is pale, they are short of breath, and have a severe headache. They can still eat and have normal bowel movements. Upon examining them, I found their pulse to be large and weak, their nose is blocked, and they appear restless. I said: It is not caused by damp heat clashing with residual food; this is cold dampness in the head. It cannot be treated with Yinchenhao and Wuling, as it is not suitable. Zhongjing states: In cases of dampness causing body pain, with fever, a yellowish face, shortness of breath, headaches, and nasal congestion, the pulse is large, and the person can still eat. There are no issues in the abdomen, indicating that the illness lies in the head; cold dampness attacking the nose causes the blockage. Medicines taken through the nose can alleviate it. Zhongjing does not provide a prescription, but this formula appears in the &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; which discusses treating the heat from seasonal epidemics. It likely harmonizes the cold dampness throughout the organs, penetrating deep into the marrow, and might cause jaundice; hence, the Guati powder is appropriate, which is this formula.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>A boat arrived with a patient suffering from a cold that had caused a yellowed nose and sore eyes, and their entire body and eyes appeared golden. The urine was red and frequent, while the bowel movements were normal. Some suggested using Yinchen and Wuling, but I said that was not the correct treatment. With normal bowel movements, it indicates the illness is not in the organs. Now, with pain in the eyes and nose, the issue lies within the pathways of the lungs. If Da Huang (rhubarb) is administered, it would certainly cause abdominal distension as a side effect. One could also use Guati San by first dissolving it in water, then placing it in the nose until the yellow fluid is completely cleared.</p>
<p>Zhao Zongyan, after excessive purging, developed jaundice with a pulse that was deep, thin, slow, and weak. Gradually, different medicines were administered, reaching Yinchen and Fuzi Decoction, which produced great effects. For the gradual approach, it meant first administering Han&#39;s Yinchen and Fuling Decoction, then moving on to Yinchen and Chenpi Decoction, and finally to Yinchen and Fuzi Decoction. Later, Scholar Zhao followed this method step by step. Due to early purging, he experienced jaundice, with a weak and shallow pulse and a cold body. He gradually took medication until reaching Yinchen and Sini Decoction, which had great effects.</p>
<p>A monk with a cold had not fully sweated out the illness and retained heat, causing his entire face and body to turn yellow and suffer from excessive heat, with a year passing without recovery. The doctor treated it as food poisoning, but that was not the correct approach, and the illness did not resolve. When asked about his diet, it had not decreased. Subsequently, this medicine was given. After five days, his condition improved by one third; after ten days, two thirds; and after twenty days, the illness was completely gone. The formula used was three parts of Yinchen and Zhi Zi, and four qian each of Qin Jiao and Sheng Ma, ground into a powder. Each time, three qian were used, boiled with four cups of water to reduce to two cups, strained, and taken warm after meals, in moderation.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>The &quot;Principles of Medicine&quot; states: A man over thirty suffered from jaundice and sought my treatment. I prescribed Wei Ling Decoction, removed the cinnamon, and added Yin Chen, using several dozen medicated plasters to reduce the yellowing. He thought himself cured and did not take the medication. After ten days, by evening, his vision failed completely. I said: This is called &quot;sparrow&#39;s eye.&quot; It is due to excessive damp phlegm and excess liver fire. I instructed him to cook pig liver and mix it with Ming Sha into pills to take, and his vision returned to normal. He came to thank me. I said: Not yet. If you do not take the liver-regulating, spleen-nourishing, phlegm-dispelling medicine early, it will certainly turn into bloating. He did not believe me, but after half a month, his abdomen gradually became bloated and full, and he sought treatment again. I prescribed Wei Ling Decoction once more, doubling the herbs, adding Mu Tong and Mai Men Dong, and prepared a decoction to take with the gold-reducing pills. After a month, he was well.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: The Grand Minister Li Pu Ting, a junior official from the Ministry of Personnel, was then suffering from jaundice and should have been treated with a light draining medicine. However, he hesitated due to his lack of heirs. I said: If you have this illness, you should use this medicine. I prescribed Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder with the addition of Qian, Lian, and Shan Zhi, and he recovered. In the year of Xin Mao, he had a son and took my hand, laughing, saying: A doctor&#39;s prescription is like a public case; if you avoid slanderous remarks, how could you enjoy your remaining years and entrust them to others? From then on, he treated me with even greater respect.</p>
<p>The governor of Yingtian suffered from full-body yellowing, spoke wildly, and endured severe chest pain, which was problematic due to blood accumulation in the middle burner. I used a single dose of Tao Ren Cheng Qi Decoction to drain the stagnant blood and he was cured.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　经言：溺黄赤安卧者，瘅病。溺黄赤者湿之征也，安静嗜卧者湿之征也，所以有开鬼门洁净府之法。开鬼门者，从汗而泄其热于肌表也。洁净府者，从下而泄其湿于小便也。此特辨明定治之大端，而精微要妙，惟《金匮》有独昭焉。要知外感发黄一证，《伤寒》阳明篇中已悉，《金匮》虽举外感内伤诸黄，一一发其底蕴，其所重尤在内伤。兹特详加表章，为后学法程焉。　　《金匮》论外感热郁于内而发黄之证云：寸口脉浮而缓，浮则为风，缓则为痹，痹非中风，四肢苦烦，脾色必黄，瘀热以行。其义取伤寒风湿相搏之变证为言，见风性虽善行，才与湿相合，其风即痹而不行，但郁为瘀热而已。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>及郁之之极，风性乃发，风发遂挟其瘀热以行于四肢，而四肢为之苦烦，显其风淫末疾之象；挟其瘀热以行于肌肤，而肌肤为之色黄，显其湿淫外渍之象；其脉以因风生热故浮，因湿成痹故缓。此而行《内经》开鬼门洁净府之法，俾风挟之热从肌表出，湿蒸之黄从小便出，而表里分消为有据也。　　《金匮》重出伤寒阳明病不解后成谷瘅一证云：阳明病脉迟者，食难用饱，饱则发烦，头眩，小便必难，此欲作谷瘅。虽下之，腹满如故，所以然者，脉迟故也。此因外感阳明胃中之余热未除，故食难用饱。饱则食复生热，两热相合，而发烦、头眩、小便难、腹满，势所必至。在阳明证本当下，阳明而至腹满尤当急下。独此一证，下之腹满必如故，非但无益，反增困耳。以其脉迟而胃气空虚，津液不充，其满不过虚热内壅，非结热当下之比。《金匮》重出此条，原有深意，见脉迟胃虚下之既无益，而开鬼门洁净府之法用之无益，不待言矣。<a id="orig-36p" href="#trans-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>尝忆一友问：仲景云，下之腹满如故，何不立一治法？予曰：仲景必用和法。先和其中，后乃下之。友曰：何以知之？予曰：仲景云，脉迟尚未可攻。味一尚字，其当攻之旨跃然。《金匮》又云，诸黄腹痛而呕者，用小柴胡汤。观此仍是治伤寒邪高痛下，故使呕也，小柴甜汤主之之法，是以知之耳。陈无择治谷瘅，用谷芽枳实小柴胡汤，差识此意。但半消半和半下，三法并用，漫无先后，较诸仲景之丝丝必贯，相去远矣。　　《金匮》又云：趺阳脉紧而数，数则为热，热即消谷，紧则为寒，食即为满。尺脉浮为伤肾，趺阳脉紧为伤脾。风寒相搏，食谷则眩，谷气不消，胃中苦浊，浊气下流，小便不通，阴被其寒，热流膀胱，身体尽黄，名曰谷瘅。此论内伤发黄，直是开天辟地未有之奇。东垣《脾胃论》仿佛什一，后世乐宗，《金匮》奥义置之不讲，殊可慨也。<a id="orig-37p" href="#trans-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>请细陈之！人身脾胃居于中土，脾之土体阴而用则阳，胃之土体阳而用则阴，两者和同，则不刚不柔，胃纳谷食，脾行谷气，通调水道，灌注百脉，相得益彰，其用大矣。惟七情饥饱房劳，过于内伤，致令脾胃之阴阳不相协和。胃偏于阳，无脾阴以和之，如造化之有夏无冬，独聚其热而消谷；脾偏于阴，无胃阳以和之，如造化之有冬无夏，独聚其寒而腹满。其人趺阳之脉，紧寒数热，必有明征。诊其或紧或数而知脾胃分主其病，诊其紧而且数而知脾胃合受其病，法云精矣。然更有精焉。诊其两尺脉浮，又知并伤其肾。夫肾脉本沉也，胡以反浮？盖肾藏精者也，而精生于谷，脾不运胃中，谷气入肾，则精无裨而肾伤，故沉脉反浮也。知尺脉浮为伤肾，则知趺阳脉紧即为伤脾。然紧乃肝脉，正仲景所谓紧乃弦状若弓弦之义。脾脉舒缓，受肝木之克贼，则变紧。<a id="orig-38p" href="#trans-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>肝之风气，乘脾聚之寒气，两相搏击，食谷即眩。是谷入不能长气于胃阳，而反动风于脾阴，即胃之聚其热而消谷者，亦不过蒸为腐败之浊气，而非精华之清气矣。浊气由胃热而下流入膀胱，则膀胱受其热气化不行，小便不通，一身尽黄。浊气繇脾寒而下流入肾，则肾被其寒，而克贼之余，其腹必满矣。究竟谷瘅由胃热伤其膀胱者多，由脾寒伤其肾者，十中二三耳。若饮食伤脾，加以房劳伤肾，其证必腹满而难治矣。仲景于女劳瘅下重申其义曰：腹如水状不治。岂不深切着明乎？　　女劳瘅，额上黑，谓身黄加以额黑也。黑为北方阴晦之色，乃加于南方离明之位，此必先有胃热脾寒之浊气下流入肾，益以女劳无度而后成之，其繇来自非一日。《肘后》谓因交接入水所致，或有所验。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>然火炎薪烬，额色转黑，虽不入水，其能免乎？故脾中之浊气，下趋入肾，水土互显之色，但于黄中见黑滞耳。若相火从水中上炎而合于心之君火，其势燎原，烟焰之色，先透于额，乃至微汗亦随火而出于额，心之液且外亡矣。手足心热，内伤皆然。日暮阳明用事，阳明主阖，收敛一身之湿热，疾趋而下，膀胱因而告急，其小便自利，大便黑时溏，又是膀胱蓄血之验。腹如水状，实非水也，正指蓄血而言也，故不治。　　酒瘅，心中懊憹而热，不能食，时欲吐。酒为湿热之最，气归于心肺，味归于脾胃，久积之热，不下行而上触则生懊憹，痞塞中焦则不能食，其湿热之气不下行而上触则为呕，呕则势转横逆，遍积周身也。《伤寒论》谓：阳明病无汗，小便不利，心中懊憹者，身必发黄。是知热甚于内者，皆足致此，非独酒矣。　　《金匮》治酒瘅用或吐或下之法云：酒黄瘅，必小便不利，其候心中热，足下热，是其证也。<a id="orig-40p" href="#trans-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>又云：或无热，靖言了了，腹满欲吐，鼻煤，其脉浮者先吐之，沉弦者先下之。又云：心中热欲呕者，吐之愈。又云：心中懊憹或热痛，栀子大黄汤主之。又云：下之久久为黑瘅。言虽错出，义实一贯。盖酒之积热入膀胱，则气化不行，必小便不利；积于上焦则心中热；积于下焦则足下热。其无心中足下热者，则靖言了了而神不昏，但见腹满、欲吐、鼻煤三证，可知其膈上与腹中阴阳交病。须分先后治之，当辨脉之浮沉以定吐下之先后。脉浮病在膈上，阳分居多，先吐上焦而后治其中满；脉沉弦，病在腹中，阴分居多，先下其中满而后治其上焦。若但心中热欲呕，则病全在上焦。吐之即愈，何取下为哉？其酒热内结，心神昏乱而作懊憹及痛楚者，则不可不下。但下法乃劫病之法，不可久用，久久下之，必脾肺之阳气尽伤，不能统领其阴血，其血有日趋于败而变黑耳。<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>曾谓下法可渎用乎？仲景于一酒瘅胪列先后次第，以尽其治，其精而且详若此。　　酒瘅之黑，与女劳瘅之黑，殊不相同。女劳瘅之黑，为肾气所发；酒瘅之黑，乃荣血腐败之色。荣者，水谷之精气，为湿热所瘀而不行，其光华之色转为晦黯，心胸嘈杂如啖蒜虀状，其芳甘之味变为酸辣，乃至肌肤抓之不仁，大便正黑，脉见浮弱，皆肺金节治之气不行而血瘀也。必复肺中清肃之气，乃可驱荣中瘀浊之血，较女劳瘅之难治，特一间耳。方书但用白朮汤，理脾气解酒热以言治，抑何庸陋之甚耶。　　黄瘅由于火土之热湿，若合于手阳明之燥金，则湿热燥三气相搏成黄，其人必渴而饮水。有此则去湿热药中，必加润燥，乃得三焦气化行，津液通，渴解而黄退。渴不解者，燥有未除耳，然非死候也。何又云瘅而渴者难治？则更虑其下泉之竭，不独云在中之津液矣。　　律三条<a id="orig-42p" href="#trans-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>　　黄瘅病得之外感者，误用补法，是谓实实，医之罪也。　　黄瘅病得之内伤者，误用攻法，是谓虚虚，医之罪也。　　阴瘅病误从阳治，袭用苦寒，倒行逆施，以致极重不返者，医杀之也。　　阴瘅无热恶寒，小便自利，脉迟而微，误开鬼门则肌肤冷鞕自汗不止，误洁净府则膀胱不约小便如奔，死期且在旦暮，况于吐下之大谬乎？即以平善之药迁延，亦为待毙之术耳。在半阴半阳之证，其始必先退阴伏阳，阴退乃从阳治。若以附子、黄连合用，必且有害，奈何纯阴无阳辄用苦寒耶？<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>

<p><strong>Entry on Jaundice</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Huangdi Neijing, Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>In the center, dampness is born; dampness produces earth; earth generates sweetness; sweetness nourishes the spleen, which appears as yellow in color. [Note: Yellow is the color of central earth.]</p>
<p><strong>From the Yujizhen Zang Lun</strong></p>
<p>Wind is the chief of all diseases. When wind and cold invade a person, it causes the hair to stand straight and the skin to close, resulting in heat. At this time, one may sweat and expel it. If there is numbness and swelling, one may use hot compresses or fire needling to remove it. If untreated, the liver transmits this to the spleen, resulting in a condition called &quot;spleen wind.&quot; Jaundice occurs when there is heat in the abdomen, leading to worry and yellow excretion. [Note: Jaundice arises from external damp heat. Heat in the abdomen leads to worry and yellow excretion, indicating internal heat.]</p>
<p><strong>From the Pingren Qixiang Lun</strong></p>
<p>If someone is yellow and lies down in comfort, it is jaundice. If after eating they feel hungry, it is stomach jaundice. If the eyes are yellow, it is known as jaundice. [Note: This recognizes the disease through observation of symptoms.]</p>
<p><strong>From the Tongping Xushi Lun</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: Jaundice with violent pain, mania, and convulsions are all the result of prolonged imbalance. [Note: Jaundice is caused by internal damp heat stagnation manifesting externally, arising from the imbalance of yin, yang, and the five elements over time.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Kidney meridian of the Foot Shaoyin governs diseases arising from the kidneys, such as dryness and heat in the mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat, shortness of breath, dry and painful throat, anxiety, heart pain, and jaundice. 【Note: The kidneys govern the storage of essence. When there are kidney diseases, essence cannot rise to nourish, resulting in symptoms like dryness and heat in the mouth, dry throat, anxiety, heart pain, and jaundice. This shows that when water does not nourish, fire becomes excessive above.】</p>

<p>Body pain with a slight yellowish hue, yellowish tongue coating, yellow nails, indicates jaundice. If the person is comfortable lying down, with yellow-red urine and a weak, thin pulse, they have no appetite. 【Note: When the earth fails to nourish the four organs, body pain arises, indicating problems with the flesh; yellow in color indicates issues with the skin; yellowish tongue coating suggests problems with the bones; yellow nails indicate issues with the tendons; jaundice indicates diseases of the spleen. Due to spleen disease, one is compelled to rest comfortably. The small intestine is referred to as the red intestine, which is part of the heart&#39;s system. The heart governs the blood vessels, and yellow-red urine and a weak pulse indicate issues with the vessels. Yellow-red urine suggests heat in the lower jiao.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer by Zhang Ji (Han Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Jaundice: Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The section on jaundice states: If the pulse at the inch is floating and amiable, the floating indicates wind, and the amiable indicates stagnation. Stagnation is not due to wind, yet the limbs suffer discomfort; the spleen is likely yellow, and stagnant heat must move. The pulse at the foot yang is tight and rapid; rapid indicates heat, which depletes nourishment, while tight indicates cold, leading to fullness upon eating. The floating pulse at the inch indicates kidney damage, and the tight pulse at the foot yang indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold clash, consuming grains leads to dizziness, and the grain energy fails to dissipate, resulting in a bitter, turbid stomach; the turbidity descends, causing difficulty in urination. The yin is afflicted by cold, heat flows to the bladder, and the body turns entirely yellow, known as grain jaundice. If the forehead is dark, there is slight sweating, and the hands and feet feel warm, this arises at dusk, with urgent bladder symptoms and spontaneous urination, termed female labor jaundice. </p>
<p>If the abdomen presents a watery appearance, it should not be treated. If there is a feeling of vexation and heat in the heart, with difficulty eating and a desire to vomit, it is called alcoholic jaundice. </p>
<p>For yangming disease, if the pulse is slow, eating becomes difficult, and fullness causes agitation and dizziness, with urination notably difficult, this indicates the onset of grain jaundice. Even with purging, the abdomen remains distended, attributed to the slow pulse. </p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there must be difficulty in urination; accompanying signs include heat in the heart and warmth in the feet. For alcoholic jaundice, some may lack heat, but their words are clear; the abdomen feels full and there is a desire to vomit, with a dry nose. The floating pulse should first be induced to vomit, and the sinking pulse should first be purged. </p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic jaundice, if there is a feeling of heat in the heart accompanied by a desire to vomit, inducing vomiting will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The jaundice descends, and over time it becomes dark jaundice. The eyes turn blue and the face blackens; the heart feels as if it has consumed garlic. The stool is distinctly dark, the skin and nails show numbness, and the pulse is superficial and weak, though it appears slightly yellow. Therefore, it is understood.</p>
<p>The teacher said: For those suffering from yellow jaundice, with fever, restlessness, and shortness of breath, these symptoms arise from the illness, where fire consumes the sweat and both heats are at play. However, yellow jaundice is obtained from dampness. When the entire body feels overheated, with a yellow face and a hot belly, it must be treated immediately.</p>
<p>A deep, thirsty pulse and difficulty in urination indicate the presence of yellow. A swollen abdomen, a coated yellow tongue, and inability to sleep due to restlessness are signs of yellow jaundice.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Suwen says: In cases of Taiyang disease, if the body is yellow, the pulse is deep and tied, with distension in the lower abdomen and difficulty in urination, it indicates a lack of blood. If urination is spontaneous and the person appears delirious, this indicates blood evidence, to be treated with Ditan Decoction. In Taiyang disease with wind, sweat is expelled by fire, and the evil wind with heat disrupts the flow of blood and qi, causing the body to turn yellow. If Yang is excessive, there is a desire to sneeze; if Yin is deficient, urination is difficult. If both Yin and Yang are exhausted, the body becomes dry, with only head sweating that rolls down, slight abdominal fullness, mild wheezing, dry mouth, and a sore throat, possibly no bowel movements; if prolonged, there may be delirium, and in severe cases, nausea occurs, with hands and feet restless, fidgeting with clothing and touching the bed. If urination is smooth, the person can be treated.</p>
<p>For cold damage with sweating, if the body and eyes turn yellow, it is because the cold and dampness inside have not been resolved. One should not purge; instead, look for remedies within the cold and dampness. If there is stasis heat inside due to cold damage, the body will certainly turn yellow, and Ma Huang, Lian Qiao, and Xiao Dou Decoction should be used. After seven to eight days of cold damage, if the body appears orange-yellow and urination is difficult, with slight abdominal fullness, Yin Chen Hao Decoction should be used. If there is increased body heat with yellowing, Zhi Zi and Ban Bei Decoction should be used. </p>
<p>The Yangming section states: If the pulse is floating and slow, with warm hands and feet, it indicates a connection to Taiyin. Taiyin conditions cause the body to turn yellow. However, if urination is smooth, yellowing cannot occur. If after seven to eight days there is constipation, it indicates a Yangming disease. With cold damage transitioning to Yangming, the person will show slight sweating.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

If a physician induces vomiting, there will be injury to the throat; if purging occurs again, both eyes may close. If cold is dominant, the stool will be clear; if heat is dominant, the stool will contain pus and blood. If one steams, the body turns yellow; if one applies heat, the throat becomes dry.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Jaundice</h3>
<p>Jaundice comes in five types: yellow sweat, yellow jaundice, grain jaundice, wine jaundice, and female labor jaundice. </p>
<p><strong>Yellow Sweat</strong>: This type presents with slight swelling of the limbs and a feeling of fullness in the chest without thirst. Sweat appears as yellow as the juice of phellodendron. It is mainly caused by excessive sweating followed by sudden immersion in water.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Jaundice</strong>: The entire body and face turn yellow like an orange. It is caused by exposure to heat and then being washed with cold water, leaving heat in the stomach, which is further aggravated by eating cucumbers. If it develops into black jaundice, the prognosis is poor.</p>
<p><strong>Grain Jaundice</strong>: After eating, one may feel dizzy, and there is an uneasy and repressed sensation in the heart along with yellowing of the skin. This results from neglecting hunger, leading to large meals, causing gas to rise and accumulate in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Wine Jaundice</strong>: This condition involves heart pain, swelling in the legs and shins, yellow urine, and reddish-yellow spots on the face, arising from excessive drunkenness combined with exposure to wind and water.</p>
<p><strong>Female Labor Jaundice</strong>: The body and eyes are both yellow, accompanied by fever and chills, a distended lower abdomen, and difficulty urinating. This occurs due to excessive labor and heat, culminating in immersion in water.</p>
<p>When it comes to the disease of wet jaundice, its initial presentation involves body pain, fever, and a black-yellow complexion. After seven to eight days, there is strong heat inside, and if there is blood present, it should be expelled immediately in a manner resembling liver from a pig. If there is distension in the lower abdomen, it should be treated urgently.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Book for the Living</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Gong, Song Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Symptoms and Treatment of Jaundice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> A person experiences pain all over the body, fever, yellowing of the skin, difficulty in urination, and frequent bowel movements.<br><strong>Answer:</strong> This condition is called &quot;middle dampness.&quot; Wind and rain invade the body&#39;s defenses, and the dampness from mountains and marshes affects many people. Dampness flows into the joints, causing bodily discomfort, with a pulse that is deep and slow, indicating &quot;middle dampness,&quot; which results in overall pain, fever, and yellow skin. If urination is smooth, a remedy like Atractylodes and Prepared Aconite Decoction is appropriate. However, if urination is difficult and bowel movements are frequent, it is necessary to promote urination; in this case, Licorice and Aconite Decoction or Wuling Powder should be used.<br>The patient has internal cold dampness that has not dissipated, heat accumulating in the spleen and stomach, blocked pores, and stagnant heat mingling with undigested food, hence the yellowing. Both yellowing and blood stasis have similar outward signs and pulse indications, but difficulty in urination is associated with yellowing, while smooth urination indicates blood stasis. In essence, a person with yellowing has accumulation in the heart and spleen, leading to fever that prompts thirst; the pulse is likely to be floating, slippery, and rapid. In contrast, the blood stasis condition resembles mania, and the stool will be black; this distinction is key.<br>When a patient feels feverish, has sweating on the forehead while the body remains dry, and experiences thirst with difficulty in urination, this will certainly lead to yellowing; the appropriate prescription is Yinchenhao Decoction with Wuling Powder. After taking the decoction, if urination improves—such as producing reddish liquid similar to soapberry juice—and the abdomen feels lighter overnight, then the yellowing will be expelled through urination.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ancients said: &quot;To treat dampness not benefiting urination is not the proper treatment.&quot; One may select from the recipes of Gardenia and Cortex Ponciri Decoction, or Ephedra, Forsythia, and Red Adzuki Bean Decoction. Additionally, for those suffering from a cold wanting to turn yellow, urgently use the powdered gourd stem, hold water in the mouth, and (allow it) to enter the nose, causing yellow fluid to be discharged; this is very effective. One may also use Artemisia and Wormwood Decoction adjusted with Wuling Powder; this is the best method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if asked: &quot;In White Tiger syndrome, there is also body heat, irritability, thirst for drink, and difficulty in urination. Why does it not turn yellow?&quot; The answer is: &quot;White Tiger is similar to the yellowing syndrome; sweating occurs all over the body, which is considered heat excess, thus it is White Tiger syndrome. When sweating occurs on the head and face, but none below the neck, this indicates yellowing syndrome.&quot;</p>
<p>If asked: &quot;In a Taiyang disease, if the entire body is in pain and feels like burning yellow, what does that mean?&quot; The reply is: &quot;This is dampness within the Taiyang. Zhongjing states that if sweating occurs from a cold damage, and the body and eyes turn yellow, it is because cold dampness in the interior has not resolved, and thus should not be purged. One should look for the condition within the cold dampness.&quot;</p>
<p>If inquired: &quot;For a patient with a wiry, floating pulse and shortness of breath, a full abdomen, pain under the ribs and in the heart, persistent pressure leading to obstruction, dry nose without sweating, excessive sleepiness, and the whole body and face turning yellow, with difficult urination and periodic coughing, what would this indicate?&quot; The answer is: &quot;This is a lesser yang wind; Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is the main treatment.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the stomach is empty like hunger, the heat in the stomach can digest grain. The Yangming meridians and the heart fire ascend, causing the heart to feel restless, the face to turn yellow, and the urine to be red and turbid. This condition is treated with the Poria Decoction with modifications. </p>
<p>The stagnation of the spleen is called &quot;repression qi,&quot; located in the gastric cavity, which is large like a cup. If it does not heal for a long time, it leads to limbs not retracting, causes jaundice, and food fails to nourish the skin. According to Zhongjing, if there is only sweating from the head and none from the body, with discomfort in the neck and difficulty in urination, and thirst for water, then the body will surely turn yellow. This indicates that heat is present at the surface, being dry and without sweat, while damp-heat is inside. The qi is so obstructed that it cannot disperse outward; thus, the damp-heat qi becomes extremely repressed and ascends, leading to the face and head showing signs of extreme yang. As a result, damp-heat condenses into slight sweating, but there is no sweat below the neck. However, damp-heat cannot naturally disperse and circulate throughout the body, leading to severe repression, causing the complexion to turn yellow. Therefore, in the case of Baihu Decoction, if there is spontaneous sweating all over the body, Zhongjing refers to it as &quot;dispersing outward,&quot; and there is no yellowing of the skin.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who experience difficulty in urination are exhibiting signs of damp-heat leading to jaundice. Some may have smooth urination, or experience mania, or have black stools, indicative of blood stasis. There are also cases of jaundice accompanied by delirium, which I do not mention here, as the signs of jaundice are not yet clear, so there is no need to elaborate. In society, there is a belief that cauterization for jaundice may lead to recovery; however, this applies to individuals with strong constitutions who do not have weakened middle qi, but merely mild damp-heat stagnation. If cauterization is misapplied, it could forcibly open the channels, leading to a release of qi and blood, resulting in sweating and recovery. Conversely, in individuals with inherently weak constitutions, if damp-heat is severe, forcible opening may lead instead to death, which is not rare. It is preferable to use Zhang Jing&#39;s methods to treat the condition with medicine, avoiding the risks of a violent intervention that may endanger life. Furthermore, recent misconceptions have circulated that extreme cold and severe jaundice are to be salvaged by rescuing the yang, which has caused numerous harms. If a mild illness is mistakenly addressed with forced opening and succeeds, such cases are rare, and the risks to life are immense. Generally, all forms of jaundice can be categorized into two types: one resulting from damp-heat and qi stagnation, which is universally applicable.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as wheat sprouts in the rain, when the heat and humidity are excessive, it leads to jaundice; during waterlogging and hot, humid weather, plants wither and turn yellow. If someone suffers from blood deficiency, they may become weak, and if dryness and heat become too severe, their body and face may turn yellow, much like how plants wither in drought. For those who are ill with dryness and heat leading to jaundice, the focus should be on reducing heat and moistening dryness. In cases of severe cold damage accompanied by humidity leading to jaundice, relieving the blockage and reducing heat while promoting drainage through both major and minor bodily channels can restore balance and aid recovery.</p>
<p>For jaundice accompanied by chest blockage, one should take equal parts of Yin Chen (artemisia) and Xian Xiong Decoction. If there is a misuse of Ba Dou (castor bean) heat-clearing pills, this can harm yin energy and excessively promote heat without resolution, leading to jaundice. In this case, taking equal parts of Da Cheng Qi Decoction can help. There are also instances where excessive heat and unrelieved conditions lead to jaundice; for those with chest blockage, add five parts of Yin Chen, three parts of Xian Xiong Decoction, and two parts of Da Cheng Qi Decoction to address it. If jaundice arises from dual environmental factors, then adding Huang Lian (coptis) detoxifying decoction for immediate relief may be necessary.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>In Yangming disease, when there is extreme exterior heat, causing irritability and thirst, along with retained fluids that do not disperse, resulting in the clash of damp and heat leading to yellowing of the body, the signs are usually sweating on the head without sweating on the body, a stiff neck, difficulty urinating, and a thirst for water. For such cases, use Yinchen Decoction adjusted with Wuling Powder.</p>
<p>When yellowing occurs due to the convergence of cold and damp, its color resembles that of mossy sludge. If one has suffered from a cold and has mistakenly induced sweating, warmed, cauterized, or pressed, or taken toxic heat-clearing medications like silver powder or large doses of Ba Dou, leading to the depletion of fluids and damage to yin energy, causing the evil heat to escalate; or if purging is done too early, causing heat to form a obstructive mass in the chest, resulting in yellowing; or if improper cold treatment is applied; or if extreme heat originates from a serious condition and even with correct treatment cannot dispel the significant heat; or if heat remains unrelieved after purging—all of these can lead to yellowing. Generally, the root cause arises from extreme heat stagnation causing retained fluids which clash with damp-heat; thus, misapplying Zhuru Fuzheng Decoction is a mistake.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ming Theory</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wujি)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to jaundice, how can this be clarified? The classical texts state: when dampness and heat intersect, the people will suffer from “tan” (jaundice). “Tan” refers to yellow; it is the manifestation of pure yang without yin. When cold damage leads to jaundice, it signifies a severe condition. When damp heat is intense, jaundice will appear; when internal heat is already strong and is further aggravated by fire, jaundice will also manifest. If the evil wind combines with fire heat, the two forms of yang will scorch each other, leading to jaundice. In cases of yangming disease, if there is slight sweating on the forehead and the urination is obstructed, jaundice must occur. This is due to internal heat combined with fire leading to jaundice. In yangming disease, if there is no sweating, obstructed urination, and a feeling of frustration in the heart, jaundice must occur. This is due to excess heat in yangming causing jaundice. If cold damage has caused sweating and the body and eyes turn yellow, the reason is that the cold dampness inside has not been resolved, as one cannot eliminate it through purging; jaundice is sought amidst cold dampness. This is jaundice caused by cold dampness. Both dampness and heat may lead to jaundice; can one distinguish between them? The two differ not only in their fundamental nature but also in their appearance. The jaundice from dampness is like a smoky yellow, dark and unclear despite its yellow hue. In contrast, the jaundice from excessive heat presents as a bright orange-yellow; in severe cases, it can stain clothing vividly, displaying the true yellow akin to “ban zhi” juice.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From this observation, are humidity and heat not different? Generally, the Huang family corresponds to the Taiyin; Taiyin is associated with the spleen. The spleen represents earth, and yellow is the color of earth. When the spleen channel is vaporized by damp heat, the color appears externally, leading to a yellow body. The classic states: if the pulse in febrile illness is floating and slow, and the hands and feet are warm, this indicates a connection to Taiyin; it is indeed the Taiyin that causes the body to turn yellow. Although the internal heat may be strong, if there is already sweating and ease of urination, it will not lead to yellowing. If the head is sweating but the body doesn&#39;t, with a reaction in the neck and difficulty in urination, along with thirst for water, this signifies stagnation of heat internally, and the body will definitely turn yellow. The Huang family represents a strong heat syndrome, and its treatment must be distinct. After eight or nine days of febrile illness, if the body appears orange-yellow and there is difficulty in urination with fullness in the lower abdomen, then Yīn Chén Hāo Decoction should be prescribed; this aims to drain and cleanse the heat.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p>If one presents with yellowing of the body, a sinking and knotty pulse, a distended lower abdomen, and voluntary urination that is akin to madness, this indicates that stagnant blood in the lower burner is causing the yellowing, and the resistance must be overcome with a decoction to promote recovery. </p>
<p>Yellowness signifies a severe illness; therefore, there are many who do not recover. It&#39;s not just that the pulse is absent at the wrist or coldness exudes from the nose, which indicates an incurable condition.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms are caused by wind and cold injuring the body, leading to the descent of yang energy into the interior, while cold water rises along the meridians. The proper response should be to induce sweating to dispel the evil influence; if the physician neglects this and fails to induce sweating, jaundice will develop. The spleen governs the muscles, and the combination of cold dampness in the limbs with internal heat leads to the manifestation of jaundice. </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If one is not to take Wuling San, what symptoms will arise?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> If one does not take it, food will not be digested, water will be eliminated, and the body will weaken, leading to dryness and heat in the Yangming, accumulating in the stomach and causing jaundice. Thus, there will be symptoms of a regulated stomach decoction, as this entails a failure to descend properly due to not having taken Wuling San. </p>
<p>If heat is present in the middle burner but has not yet reached the origin of the Taiyang, and urination is clear and smooth, this indicates that fluids have circulated. If Wuling San is used to promote urination, it would further deplete the kidney&#39;s water. Not only does this deplete the kidney&#39;s water, but it also prevents the heat from toxins in alcohol from being resolved, leading to blockage both above and below, resulting in jaundice; if it enters the blood chamber, it would result in blood stasis.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Treatment of Jaundice</strong>  </p>
<p>The smallpox does not differentiate into the five types; they all share the quality of damp-heat, similar to the characteristics of the Yang. For mild cases, use the small warming pill; for severe cases, use the large warming pill. If there is much heat, add Scutellaria and Lian. In cases of excess dampness, utilize the Yinchen Wuling Powder with digestive herbs. If damp-heat causes reversed stomach Qi leading to diarrhea, treat with Ginseng and Astragalus added to Gardenia, Yinchen, and Licorice. </p>
<p>Dai Yun states: The five types of jaundice manifest as skin and eye discoloration resembling water of Gardenia. If caused by food accumulation resulting in yellowness, assess the condition&#39;s strength and weakness and purge the food accumulation; for others, prioritize promoting urination. Light urination will appear white; the yellowness will subside naturally. </p>
<p>Jaundice arises from heat in the spleen and stomach channel; the cause should be investigated. Focus on purging first and then detoxifying. Symptoms like pale lips, restlessness, tinnitus, weakness in the legs, slight cold with fever, and cloudy urination indicate a deficiency. Treat with Four Gentleman Decoction and swallow the Eight Flavors Pill. Avoid excessive use of cooling agents or overly forceful promotion of urination, as it might lead to kidney water depletion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Five Types of Jaundice Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Including Facial Yellowing)</strong></p>
<p>Jaundice generally has five types: yellow, which indicates the color of the spleen. When the spleen is injured, the illness manifests externally, causing the whole body and face to appear yellow. It is advisable to use a base formula of Wuling Powder with Yinchen (Artemisia capillaris), or a combination of Wuling Powder and Pingwei Powder in equal parts, called Weiling Powder. </p>
<p>Yellow sweat occurs due to heat in the spleen and stomach, leading to sweating that may mix with bathwater, resulting in yellow sweat staining clothes. Only the aforementioned remedy is suitable. </p>
<p>Jaundice due to excessive drinking and eating causes the organs to become extremely heated, additionally impacted by wind and dampness, leading to stagnation that does not disperse. The damp heat condenses, causing both the body and eyes to turn yellow, sometimes accompanied by chills and fever; the prior remedy should be used. </p>
<p>Wine-induced jaundice arises from overconsumption of alcohol, commonly known as wine jaundice. It is best treated with a decoction of dry kudzu or gardenia seeds mixed with Wuling Powder, or with raw Wuling decoction adding a penny’s worth of dry kudzu. </p>
<p>Drinking leads to sleep, letting the wine poison harm the lungs. The spleen (earth) nourishes the lungs (metal); thus, when the lung receives the illness, it affects the spleen, resulting in yellowing. Furthermore, the lungs govern the skin, and since they are exposed to the wine’s toxins, the yellowing appears on the skin. Therefore, these two explanations are valid; treatment should address both the spleen and lungs, preferably using Huo Pi Decoction.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Jaundice occurs due to the harm from irregular eating, causing the stomach qi to become disturbed and resulting in yellowing of the complexion. When food is ingested, dizziness and discomfort may arise, so it is advisable to use red pills. If jaundice arises from damage to the spleen, it has already been observed with previous cases of yellowing. Heat toxins that harm the spleen can also lead to jaundice, and for this, a decoction of reed flowers combined with Wuling powder is recommended.</p>
<p>After loss of blood, the face often turns yellow. Blood is essential for nourishment; a rosy complexion indicates the presence of blood, while its absence results in yellowing. This can be likened to plants: in spring and summer, leaves are green, while in autumn, they turn yellow, signifying the difference between moist and dry conditions. The nourishing decoction, Zhigui decoction, or the Complete Tonifying Decoction should be used. For those who cannot eat, add Huangqi and Biandou each at a small amount to the Four Gentlemen Decoction. Alternatively, adding these two ingredients to Yigong powder is also acceptable. There are cases where the body is completely yellow, but the yellowing does not extend to the ears and eyes.</p>
<p>After an attack of malaria, many people experience yellowing, as malaria is associated with cold in the spleen. When the spleen is affected by illness, the complexion reflects this change. Therefore, it is crucial to address the spleen first. For this condition, Yigong powder with half a small amount of Huangqi and Biandou is also recommended. Any yellowing following other illnesses should also be addressed similarly.</p>
<p>For farmers suffering from jaundice due to overexertion after a full meal, causing spleen qi to become uncomfortably constrained, it is recommended to use the Shen Jin Wan from Master Yang.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Differentiation of Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Internal jaundice arises from physical labor and irregularities in diet, with changes in the Central States leading to cold, resulting in the onset of yellowing. It is not caused by external factors, so treating it with Jianzhong, Lizhong, or Dajianzhong is sufficient. Jaundice from improper diet and excessive labor is called &quot;yellow fat,&quot; and is an acute illness. Thus, Zhongjing sets an eighteen-day period for it. Jaundice from dietary labor is a chronic condition, with some cases lingering for a long time. </p>
<p>When it comes to jaundice affecting the eyes, the classics state that eye jaundice means yellowing, but there are instances where the eyes are yellow while the body is not. When the wind qi enters from the Yangming channel into the stomach and travels along the meridians to the eye corners, if the person is heavy and the wind qi cannot escape, it leads to heat in the body, causing yellowing of the eyes. </p>
<p>Black jaundice presents with swelling of the face, back pain preventing upright posture, and a dark complexion, often accompanied by profuse sweating and aversion to wind, indicating wind-related issues. </p>
<p><strong>Differentiation by Color</strong>: If the color is like smoky yellow, it indicates a damp illness, accompanying pain throughout the body; if the color resembles that of oranges, it indicates jaundice with no body pain.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Diagnosis and Treatment of Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Damp jaundice, with &quot;damp&quot; referring to water, often occurs in the southeastern regions, where wind and rain attack the weak. The steam from mountains and marshes causes many to become afflicted with dampness. When dampness invades the meridians, there is evening fever and nasal congestion; in the joints, there is pain throughout the body; in the organs, there is a mix of clear and turbid in the stools, leading to loose stools and thick urine, while the abdomen may feel swollen. When damp heat combines, the body may turn yellow as if smoke has colored it, with mild cases showing only slight yellowing of the face. Mistaken purging results in wheezing; mistaking sweating leads to convulsions and death. Promoting urination is beneficial, and Wu Ling San (Five Poria Powder) is the primary treatment to eliminate dampness. If urination is hindered and bowel movements are too frequent, use Gan Cao Fu Zi Tang (Licorice and Aconite Decoction). If urine is not yellow, use Zhu Fu Tang (Atractylodes and Aconite Decoction). For body pain and nasal congestion, use Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang (Astragalus Nourishing the Center Decoction). For strong abdominal pressure and urinary retention, add Ting Li to Zhi Zhu Tang (Orange Peel and Atractylodes Decoction). If yellowing appears later. The yellow syndrome is marked by thirst and sweating from the head; if heat accumulates, the urine becomes thick and the abdomen distends, while if blood accumulates, the urine is clear and the lower abdomen feels tightly bound. The classics state that damp heat intermingling results in jaundice in the populace.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Jaundice refers to yellowing, resulting from the condition of having excessive yang without yin. Although the yellowing from cold damage varies, it is all due to internal heat caused by the improper use of warming medicines, or from excessive fire attack, or from losing sweat and purging, leading to heat in the Yangming channel that manifests as true color on the skin, known as ‘stagnation heat resulting in jaundice.’ Symptoms include sweating, thirst, and poor urination, with bright yellow color; treatments include Yin Chen decoction, Yin Chen Three-Ingredient Decoction, and Tao’s Yin Chen Decoction.</p>
<p>For those with damp-heat causing jaundice, symptoms include body pain, fever, and dark yellow color; the treatment is Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder. For those with cold damp causing jaundice, it indicates the presence of cold damp inside as a complication of the Taiyang disease; if sweating is excessive, the cold will dissipate but damp will remain; thus, the treatment is Ma Huang, Lian Qiao, and Chi Xiao Dou Decoction.</p>
<p>If body pain and nasal congestion are present, swiftly employ the method of using the watermelon seed husk to treat the nose, alongside internal administration of Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder. If there is severe headache, add Yin Chen to Shen Zhu San.</p>

<p>All cases of jaundice are due to insufficient urination. Only the yellow caused by stagnant blood allows for smooth urination, and this is accompanied by both stagnant blood and exterior heat symptoms, indicated by sweating on the head, thirst, and a floating, rapid pulse.

If there are alternating chills and fever with persistent pain and yellowing, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Gardenia. Fever with sweating, thirst for water, smooth urination, quick defecation, and yellowing, use Wu Ling San with Yin Chen.

<p><strong>Medical Law</strong> [Qing Dynasty by Yu Chang]</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>The Classics say: &quot;Those who urinate yellow and red, and can lie quietly, have jaundice.&quot; Urinating yellow and red indicates dampness, while being calm and fond of lying down also indicates dampness. Therefore, there are methods for opening the Ghost Gate and purifying the Rectum. Opening the Ghost Gate allows heat to leak through the surface of the skin via sweat. Purifying the Rectum releases dampness through urination. This clarifies the fundamental principles of diagnosis and treatment, with intricate details found only in the “Classic of the Gold Coffer.” </p>
<p>It is essential to understand that the yellowing caused by external factors is fully elaborated in the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; particularly in the Yangming chapter. Though the &quot;Classic of the Gold Coffer&quot; mentions both external and internal causes of jaundice, it emphasizes the importance of internal injuries. Here, I will elaborate for future learners.</p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of the Gold Coffer&quot; discusses jaundice resulting from internal heat stagnation caused by external pathogens, stating: &quot;The pulse at the cun position is floating and slow; floating indicates wind, and slow indicates stasis. Stasis is not true wind, but the limbs feel heavy and there is a yellowish complexion, resulting from stagnant heat.&quot; This means that the interaction of wind and dampness in cold damage leads to this manifestation; although wind is generally good at mobilizing, when it combines with dampness, it becomes stagnant and does not move, resulting only in heat stagnation.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<p>At this point, the methods from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; should be employed to open the pathways and cleanse the body, allowing the heat carried by the wind to be released from the surface of the skin, and the damp yellow to be expelled through urination, thereby clarifying the distinction between the exterior and interior.</p>
<p>The &quot;Synopsis of Golden Coffer&quot; mentions that when a Yangming disease does not resolve after exposure to cold, it may result in a condition known as grain stagnation. If the pulse is slow, eating becomes difficult, leading to fullness; fullness results in agitation, dizziness, and difficulty urinating. This indicates an impending condition of grain stagnation. Even with treatment, the abdomen remains distended, which is attributed to the pulse being slow. The lingering heat in the Yangming stomach from external sources remains present, complicating digestion. When full, the food generates further heat, and the combination of the two heats leads to agitation, dizziness, difficulty in urination, and abdominal distension, making it inevitable.</p>
<p>In the case of Yangming syndrome, one should typically purge, especially if there is significant abdominal distension. However, in this specific scenario, purging will not alleviate the distension; rather, it may increase discomfort. This is due to the pulse being slow and the stomach being empty, with fluids not being sufficient. The fullness is merely a manifestation of internal excess heat, not an accumulation of solid heat in need of purging.</p>
<p>The repetition of this principle in the &quot;Synopsis of Golden Coffer&quot; carries profound meaning, indicating that when the pulse is slow and the stomach is weak, purging is not only ineffective but the methods to open the pathways and cleanse the body will also prove useless, which goes without saying.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I remember a friend once asked: Zhang Zhongjing said that if the lower abdomen is still full as before, why not establish a treatment method? I replied: Zhang Zhongjing must use harmonizing methods. First harmonize internally, and only then can one purge it. My friend asked: How do you know this? I said: Zhang Zhongjing states that if the pulse is slow, it is not yet time to attack. The meaning of &quot;harmonizing&quot; clearly indicates the intention to resolve it. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; also says that for those with yellow abdominal pain and vomiting, one should use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. Observing this, it still treats the evil of cold damage causing high pain below, hence leading to vomiting. The sweet decoction of Xiao Chai is the method for this, which is why I know. Chen Wuzhe treated food stasis with a decoction of malt and bitter orange combined with Xiao Chai Hu, slightly recognizing this principle. However, using half of each method—half resolving, half harmonizing, and half purging—all together without order, is far from the meticulous approach of Zhang Zhongjing. </p>
<p>The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; also states: When the pulse at the foot yang is tight and rapid, rapid indicates heat, and heat causes food to not digest; tightness indicates cold, and fullness arises from food. A floating pulse at the chi position indicates kidney damage, while a tight pulse at the foot yang indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold clash, eating grain leads to dizziness. If the grain energy does not dissipate, it causes bitter and turbid conditions in the stomach, with turbid qi flowing down, leading to obstructed urination. The cold affects the yin, heat flows into the bladder, and the body turns completely yellow; this condition is called food stasis. This discussion on internal injury causing yellowing is truly an unprecedented marvel. Dong Yuan&#39;s &quot;Discussion on the Spleen and Stomach&quot; somewhat resembles one-tenth of this, and later generations delight in the sect, disregarding the profound meanings of the &quot;Jin Kui,&quot; which is truly lamentable.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Please elaborate! The human body’s spleen and stomach reside in the central region. The spleen, representing the earth, is Yin in nature but functions as Yang; the stomach, representing the earth, is Yang in nature but functions as Yin. When these two are harmonized, neither too rigid nor too yielding exists. The stomach receives food, while the spleen processes the essence of grains, regulating the waterways and nourishing the various channels, achieving great utility. However, the seven emotions, along with hunger, fullness, and exertion, when excessive, cause internal harm, leading to a disharmony between the Yin and Yang of the spleen and stomach. If the stomach leans towards Yang without the Yin of the spleen to harmonize it, it is akin to nature experiencing summer without winter, accumulating heat alone and digesting grains inadequately. If the spleen leans towards Yin without the Yang of the stomach to harmonize it, it is like nature undergoing winter without summer, accumulating cold alone and leading to bloating. Those having a tense and rapid pulse in the Yang veins will surely exhibit clear signs. Diagnosing whether the pulse is tense or rapid reveals that the spleen and stomach govern the illness. If both tense and rapid, it indicates that the spleen and stomach share in the affliction, as the principle states accurately. Yet, there is a deeper understanding. If the pulse in both wrists is floating, it also suggests damage to the kidneys. The kidney pulse is inherently deep, so why is it floating? This is because the kidneys store essence, and essence is produced from grains. If the spleen fails to transport what’s in the stomach, the grain essence enters the kidneys, leading to a lack of nourishment for the essence and resultant kidney damage, which causes the deep pulse to become floating. Knowing the floating pulse in the wrists indicates kidney harm leads to the understanding that the tense Yang pulse indicates spleen injury. However, tension pertains to the liver pulse, aligning with what Zhongjing stated—that tension is like a bowstring. When the spleen pulse is loose, and it is affected by the liver wood’s overgrowth, it becomes tense.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The wind from the liver, combined with the coldness from the spleen, clash with each other, causing dizziness upon consuming grains. When grains enter and cannot thrive in the stomach&#39;s yang, they instead generate wind in the spleen&#39;s yin. The heat that gathers in the stomach and dissipates the grains merely turns them into a putrid, turbid qi, rather than pure essence. This turbid qi flows down from the stomach&#39;s heat into the bladder, resulting in heat obstructing the bladder&#39;s function, leading to difficulty in urination and a yellow complexion throughout the body. If the turbid qi flows down from the spleen&#39;s cold into the kidneys, the kidneys will be affected by this cold, and their excess will cause abdominal fullness. Ultimately, the condition of grain stagnation most often arises from stomach heat harming the bladder, while only about two or three in ten cases stem from spleen cold harming the kidneys. If food injures the spleen and is compounded by sexual exhaustion damaging the kidneys, the symptoms will inevitably lead to abdominal fullness that is difficult to treat. Zhongjing reiterated the principle regarding female conditions and abdominal heaviness, stating: &quot;The abdomen is water-like and untreated.&quot; Is this not profoundly clear? </p>
<p>For female conditions of abdominal heaviness, the forehead appears dark, indicating a yellow body with an additional dark forehead. Black, as a color of the north&#39;s darkness, added to the brightness of the south, signifies that there must first be turbid qi from stomach heat and spleen cold flowing down to the kidneys, compounded by excessive female labor, leading to this condition; its origins are not from just one day. The &quot;Zhouhou&quot; text suggests that this can be caused by intercourse leading to fluid accumulation, with some evidence to support this.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When fire burns through firewood, the forehead&#39;s color turns black; although it does not enter water, can it be avoided? Therefore, the turbid gas within the spleen descends and enters the kidneys, the colors of water and earth reveal themselves, but in the yellow there is only black stagnation. If the fire of the heart rises from the water and joins with the sovereign fire of the heart, its force can spread like wildfire, the smoke and flames first manifest on the forehead, to the point where even a slight sweat will emerge from there, causing the heart&#39;s fluid to be drained. The heat in the hands and feet is the same; the internal injuries are just as dire. At dusk, when yangming is at work, yangming governs closure and gathers the damp heat of the entire body, hastily descending, the bladder consequently gives urgent signals, with smooth urination, and dark stools signify a retention of blood in the bladder. The abdomen appears water-like, but it is not water; it specifically refers to the retention of blood, hence it is not treated. </p>
<p>Alcoholic stagnation creates heat and bitterness in the heart, causing inability to eat and occasional urges to vomit. Alcohol is the most detrimental of damp and heat, as its energy returns to the heart and lungs, its taste is attributed to the spleen and stomach. When the heat accumulates for a long time, if it does not descend but instead rises, it leads to bitterness and blockage in the middle jiao, resulting in an inability to eat. If the damp heat does not descend but rises, it causes vomiting. When vomiting occurs, the direction reverses and accumulates throughout the body. </p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; states that if yangming disease has no sweating, if urination is not smooth, and if there is bitterness in the heart, the body is sure to turn yellow. This indicates that if the heat within is intense, it can lead to this condition, and it is not solely due to alcohol. </p>
<p>The &quot;Golden Cabinet&quot; states regarding the treatment of alcoholic stagnation, using methods of either inducing vomiting or purging, that alcoholic yellow stagnation will surely lead to unsmooth urination, with heat felt in the heart and heat in the feet being the symptoms.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: If there is no heat but clear speech, fullness in the abdomen with a desire to vomit, and a dark nose, then one should first induce vomiting for those with a floating pulse, and first purge for those with a deep and taut pulse. Additionally, if there is heat in the heart causing nausea, vomiting will bring relief. Furthermore, if there is vexation in the heart or heat causing pain, the prescription of Gardenia and Rhubarb decoction should be used. Moreover, if purging leads to prolonged black stool, this indicates a deeper issue. Although words may be expressed differently, the meaning is consistent.</p>
<p>When the heat from alcohol accumulates in the bladder, the qi cannot flow, which leads to difficulty in urination; if it accumulates in the upper burner, it causes heat in the heart; if it accumulates in the lower burner, it causes heat in the feet. If there is no heat in the heart or feet, and the speech is clear and the spirit is not clouded, but there is fullness in the abdomen, a desire to vomit, and dark nasal discharge, it indicates a mixed disorder of yin and yang in the stomach and abdomen.</p>
<p>Treatment must be sequentially divided, distinguishing between the floating and deep pulses to determine whether to induce vomiting or to purge first. A floating pulse indicates disease in the upper burner, with more yang present, so one should first induce vomiting for fullness in the upper burner and then treat the fullness in the middle. A deep and taut pulse indicates disease in the abdomen, with more yin present, so one should first alleviate the fullness in the middle and then treat the upper burner.</p>
<p>However, if the heat in the heart leads to a desire to vomit, the issue is entirely in the upper burner. Inducing vomiting will provide relief, so why focus on purging? If heat from alcohol causes inner binding, leading to confusion of the spirit and feelings of vexation and pain, then purging is necessary. But purging is a method that depletes the disease, and should not be used for long. If purged excessively over time, it will inevitably damage the yang qi of the spleen and lungs, preventing them from regulating the yin blood, which may lead to a deterioration of the blood that eventually turns black.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Have I ever suggested that the lower methods can be used inappropriately? Zhang Zhongjing arranged the treatment of alcoholic intoxication in a specific sequence, indicating the meticulousness of his approach.</p>
<p>The darkness of alcoholic intoxication differs significantly from that of female labor intoxication. The darkness from female labor arises from kidney qi, while that from alcohol reflects the corrupted color of vital blood. The &quot;vital&quot; refers to the essence of water and grains, which becomes stagnant due to damp heat, turning its brilliance into dullness. The chest feels tumultuous like chewing garlic, and its sweet flavor transforms to sour and spicy. Moreover, the skin becomes insensate to touch, the stools are notably dark, and the pulse is weak and floating—all indicating a blockage of lung qi and stagnation of blood.</p>
<p>To restore the clear and purifying qi of the lungs is necessary to drive out the impure blood within the vital essence. This condition is relatively easier to treat than female labor intoxication. The prescriptions merely recommend the use of Baizhu Decoction to regulate spleen qi and resolve the heat of alcohol; what an inept approach!</p>
<p>Hypertension arises from the heat and dampness of fire and earth. If it coincides with the dryness of the Yangming channel, the combination of these three opposing energies produces a yellow coloration in the individual, who will inevitably experience thirst and drink water. In this case, one must enhance the moistening and drying herbs within the damp-heat formulas to achieve proper transformation and flow of fluids in the three burners, thereby alleviating thirst and eliminating the yellow hue. If thirst persists, it indicates that dryness has not yet been resolved, but it is not a terminal condition. Why, then, is it said that thirst associated with intoxication is difficult to treat? </p>
<p>This raises further concern about the depletion of lower sources, not just the body fluids within. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Jaundice</strong></p>
<p>Jaundice, according to ancient scholars, is often attributed to damp-heat, with distinctions made among five types of jaundice, but these categorizations do not fully capture its essence. What is essential to understand about jaundice can be categorized into four types: yang jaundice, yin jaundice, exterior pathogen-induced jaundice, and gallbladder jaundice. Understanding these four types exhausts the discussion on jaundice.</p>
<p>Danxi stated that jaundice does not necessarily have to be divided into five types; it is all damp-heat, akin to the similarity of curving in nature. Can we truly say that all such instances are merely damp-heat? This is insufficient as evidence. I foolishly categorize them as follows:</p>
<p>Yang jaundice occurs when excessive dampness leads to heat; heat then produces jaundice, which is what we call a damp-heat syndrome. However, its symptoms must include fever, thirst, restlessness, increased appetite, or signs of painful and burning urination, or constipation. Its pulse will be strong and slippery. This condition does not strictly adhere to exterior or interior influences; it can arise from either external wind-dampness or internal injury from food and drink. Yet, if one observes that the vital energy remains strong and the spleen and stomach are not harmed, while damp-heat is indeed severe, the correct approach is to clear the heat and promote urination. Once the damp-heat is eliminated, the jaundice will diminish. Treating this condition is not difficult.</p>
<p>Yin jaundice, on the other hand, is entirely different from damp-heat and originates from the failure of blood and qi.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence does not generate blood, and thus blood fails; blood does not manifest color, and hence color fails. In cases of jaundice where there is absolutely no evidence of Yang symptoms or Yang pulse, it indicates Yin jaundice. What causes the illness of Yin jaundice? It must be due to the disturbance of the seven emotions affecting the organs, or fatigue harming the body, leading to a great depletion of central Qi, causing the spleen to fail in its function of transforming blood. Consequently, the color of the spleen&#39;s earth phase is revealed externally. In this condition, the patient prefers rest and dislikes movement, seeks darkness and fears brightness. Symptoms include mental fatigue, slight speech, possible dizziness and vertigo, aversion to cold and reduced appetite, weakness in the limbs, or unformed stools and urine like oil, along with a weak pulse—these are all signs of Yang deficiency. This stands in contrast to jaundice caused by damp-heat, which is like ice versus fire; if the original Qi is not quickly restored and the spleen and kidneys are not significantly nourished, there is no possibility of recovery. Additionally, these cases are most common; if one sees only yellow coloration without assessing pulse and symptoms, and hastily concludes it is jaundice, treating it as damp-heat with herbs like gardenia or gentian to clear heat and promote urination, there will inevitably be fatal outcomes following the treatment. The yellowing from exterior pathogens is actually a sign of a cold damage syndrome. In cases where cold damage leads to sweating that cannot penetrate and wind-damp is present on the surface, there can be yellow symptoms; or if the exterior pathogen is unresolved, transmitting internally and damp-heat is constrained in the Yangming, yellow symptoms can also occur.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who have not resolved the external邪 will definitely experience fever, body pain, floating pulse, and slight sweating; they should be treated by inducing sweat to disperse the邪. For those with internal damp-heat stagnation, there will necessarily be irritability, a slow and slippery pulse, and profuse sweating; they should be treated by clearing and eliminating the dampness and heat.

<p>As for yellow bile syndrome, it occurs with great fright or injury from fighting. I have seen cases where someone, terrified by a tiger or wolf, lost courage suddenly and fell ill with yellowness; such cases develop rapidly. There are also cases caused by harsh officials or fears of disaster, where constant terror leads to gradual illness; such cases develop more slowly. During the 11th year of the Yongming era in the Qi dynasty, a student named Wei Zhun died from excessive fright, his whole body turned blue, and people believed it was due to a broken gallbladder, exemplifying this phenomenon. I have also observed cases of yellowness developing gradually after brawls, caused by gallbladder injury. The symptoms are characterized by absence of fire and dampness, with patients feeling lethargic and drowsy, and their complexion appearing a uniform yellow as if dyed. All of these symptoms stem from gallbladder injury; when the gallbladder is harmed, its energy is depleted, leading to leakage of bile, hence the manifestation of these symptoms. The text states: when bile leaks, it causes a bitter mouth, and when stomach energy is reversed, it leads to bitter vomiting; thus, it is called vomiting bile, reflecting the same principle.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The gallbladder is linked to the liver, governing the vital energy of the lesser yang in spring. Where there is life, there is growth; where there is none, there is death. Hence it is said in the classics that all eleven organs depend on the gallbladder, for the vital energy within the gallbladder is the source of all transformations. If any of these conditions arise from harm to the gallbladder, then the vital energy is depleted. Once the vital energy is depleted, how can it produce life? Therefore, those suffering from these ailments often lead to dire consequences. However, if one examines the subtlety of the energy closely and acts quickly to restore the foundation, recovery is still possible. The authority of mending the heavens with stone is in the hands of those skilled in medicine.</p>
<p>Regarding jaundice, there are ancient distinctions of five types: Yellow Sweat, Yellow Jaundice, Grain Jaundice, Wine Jaundice, and Women&#39;s Labor Jaundice. In summary, if sweat soaks clothing, resembling the color of barberry juice, it is called Yellow Sweat; if the body, face, and eyes turn golden yellow, with yellow urine and without sweating, it is Yellow Jaundice; if it arises due to dietary harm to the spleen, it is Grain Jaundice; if caused by dampness from alcohol consumption, it is Wine Jaundice; if due to desires harming the yin, it is Women&#39;s Labor Jaundice. Although they have such distinctions, they ultimately fall into the categories of yin and yang. Generally, yang conditions are more solid, while yin conditions tend to be more deficient. Understanding this distinction between deficiency and excess captures the essence.</p>
<p>Difficult-to-treat jaundice conditions include: no pulse at the wrist, cold sweat at the nose, a body resembling one smudged by smoke, unsteady head with fixed gaze, dark black around the mouth, yellow oily sweat, and a long-term blackening of the skin—all of which are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Yang jaundice is often caused by dampness in the spleen leading to obstructed heat. It is essential to clear the fire and resolve dampness; when fire is cleared, urination will improve, and when urination improves, the jaundice will recede. For mild cases, prescriptions such as Yin Chen drink, Da Fen Qing drink, or Zhi Zi Ban Pi decoction are appropriate. If there is severe blockage with intense heat, manifesting as difficulty in urination and abdominal fullness, the treatment should include Yin Chen Hao decoction or Zhi Zi Da Huang decoction.</p>
<p>Yin jaundice, on the other hand, is often due to internal injury and insufficiency. One should not focus solely on clearing; it is important to tonify and replenish the heart, spleen, and kidneys to nurture blood and qi. When blood and qi are restored, the jaundice will surely fade. Key formulas include Si Jun Zi decoction, Wu Jun Zi drink, Shou Pi decoction, and Wen Wei drink, which are essential for the heart and spleen. If there is yang deficiency within the yin, remedies like Liu Wei Wan, Ba Wei Wan, Wu Fu drink, Li Yin decoction, as well as Zuo Gui and You Gui formulas are indicated. If the original qi is insufficient but there is considerable cold dampness, then formulas like Wu Ling San, Si Ling San, or variations of Yin Chen Wu Ling San can also be used with appropriate adjustments.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of cold-damage with jaundice, when the exterior pathogen has not cleared and there is a predominance of damp-heat, the symptoms will manifest both on the surface and internally. Treatment should aim to resolve both aspects, recommended formulas include Chai Ling Decoction or Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder; if internal heat is severe while the exterior pathogen remains, Chai Ling Decoction is indicated. If there is only internal damp-heat leading to fullness and obstruction without external pathogen, Yin Chen Hao Decoction should be used. If jaundice occurs due to internal injury from fatigue, there will often be symptoms of jaundice, but if there&#39;s no evidence of internal damp-heat or pathogens, it is essential to use methods for yin jaundice to tonify and treat, possibly employing the method of Han Zhi as well. Merely attacking the pathogen without careful consideration will not lead to success. Therefore, Master Sun states: when jaundice is coupled with a floating pulse, it should be resolved with sweating, using Gui Zhi with Huang Qi Decoction. This exemplifies the method of supplementing the deficient and dispersing pathogens. External symptoms of cold damage should be thoroughly examined as well. The yellow bile condition is always due to liver damage. Once the liver suffers harm, the loss of the organ&#39;s qi becomes apparent; without restoration, rupture is inevitable. Thus, in the presence of such symptoms, it is essential to use generous amounts of warm sweet remedies to rapidly restore vital energy.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

If one treats this condition while further enforcing excessive measures, it&#39;s truly akin to pressing on an egg.</p>
<p>The treatment for Jaundice fundamentally should clear dampness and promote urination, although there are many cases not suitable for such measures, as discussed in detail in the treatise on dampness conditions.</p>
<p>Han Zhihe commented: If a patient takes excessive medication for three to five days, it weakens their spleen and stomach, depletes their bodily fluids, causing thirst for water, while the spleen soil becomes dampened and meets with evil heat to result in Jaundice. This is Yin Jaundice, and it should be treated with warming medicines. If the pulse in both hands is deep, thin, and slow, the limbs are cold, the skin develops bumps, or there is vomiting with a coating on the tongue, widespread yellowness, restlessness with a desire to lie in muddy water, and scanty, red urination, these are all signs of Yin conditions. Therefore, Yin Jaundice is often warmed with hot broth, or a cloth soaked in broth is applied to the chest and abdomen, or hot broth is held in a ladle and placed under the navel for fomentation.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who recover from this illness often have been treated for Zhao Xianzong’s cold damage lasting six or seven days. Due to excessive medication, they develop jaundice. Their pulse is deep, thin, slow, and weak, their skin is cool, their hair is frizzy, they desire to lie in mud, they experience wheezing and vomiting, and their urine is red and clouded. Initially, I prescribed a decoction of artemisia and dried orange peel, which alleviated the wheezing and vomiting; then, half a dose of the small artemisia decoction was given, and their pulse slightly improved, reducing the desire to lie in mud. The next day, half a dose of the artemisia and aconite decoction was administered, their limbs became warm, they urinated two to three liters, and they sweated profusely on that day, resulting in recovery. Cases like this are too numerous to list individually. </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage with jaundice, it is often associated with the celestial bodies of the sun or the moon. If purged excessively, it often turns to a severe jaundice. The presence of the Chen and Xu (the hours of the day associated with the sun) indicates cold water in charge, which invades the earth; for the Chou and Wei (the hours associated with the moon), damp earth is in charge, leading to insufficient earth energy, resulting in spleen and stomach weakness. This allows water to invade, frequently resulting in this condition.</p>
<p>Jaundice from cold damage often arises from damp heat. Symptoms may include difficulty with small urination, either yellow or red urine, a distended but painless lower abdomen, or firm stools with extreme thirst. The pulse is deep, solid, and strong, indicating damp heat. For mild cases, a formula of artemisia and five grain dispersal may be sufficient; for severe cases, the artemisia decoction can be used to promote urination, clear the blood, and eliminate heat, thus causing the jaundice to recede. However, there are also cases of yin jaundice with different treatment methods; these are detailed above and should be referred to accordingly.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescriptions of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Jaundice</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of jaundice include yellowing of the entire body and eyes, which indicates a death sentence. However, if treated at the onset, it may not necessarily lead to death. I possess a remarkable formula called the Decoction to Eliminate Jaundice and Resolve Dampness. It consists of three qian of Artemisia, three liang each of Job&#39;s tears and Plantago seeds, two liang of Poria, and three fen of cinnamon, which is to be boiled and consumed. After four doses, the jaundice will disappear and the dampness will resolve.  </p>
<p>Although jaundice arises from damp heat, the root cause is ultimately a deficiency of the spleen that fails to regulate and eliminate water and dampness, resulting in stagnation and jaundice. I prescribe large doses of Poria, Job&#39;s tears, and Plantago as the chief ingredients to dispel water dampness while also being fortifying for the spleen and qi; a small amount of Artemisia is used to resolve damp heat, and the cinnamon is included to guide it to the bladder for elimination through urination, subtly addressing the damp heat in the process. This formula is both light and exquisite, simple yet miraculous.  </p>
<p>After the first four doses, reduce the amount by half and add one liang of Atractylodes, then brew and drink. Use another four doses, and they will recover completely without subsequent issues. The symptoms of jaundice should generally not lead to death.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If treatment methods are not correct, it often transforms life into death. Indeed, jaundice caused by external dampness is easily treated, while those from internal injury are difficult to heal. In cases of external dampness, simply treating the dampness can lead to the recovery from jaundice, whereas treating internal injury solely for dampness makes recovery from jaundice challenging. Purging water diminishes vital energy, and inducing sweat causes loss of essence. How can one expect a rapid recovery from jaundice?</p>
<p>I have a remedy that treats internal injury causing jaundice, called the Internal Dissipation Jaundice Decoction. It consists of one tael each of Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria, and Job’s tears, two qian each of Artemisia capillaris and fried Gardenia fruit, and five fen of dried tangerine peel, all boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this prescription lies in the abundant use of Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria, and Job’s tears, which strengthen the spleen and facilitate water metabolism, assisting Artemisia capillaris and Gardenia fruit in dissipating dampness and heat, all from within the bladder, without the need to additionally expel the dampness from the skin, which will resolve itself. Generally, using this formula for ten doses will result in complete dissipation; it is not necessary to exceed ten doses. After ten doses, reduce to half, eliminate the Gardenia fruit, and take five more doses for full recovery; the person will be strong and vigorous. This is a remarkably effective and miraculous remedy, beneficial and harmless, suitable for treating those with internal injury compounded by dampness.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Five types of jaundice: Cui Yuanliang in &quot;On Maritime Methods&quot; states that there are several types of jaundice; it can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption or the mistaken ingestion of rat droppings. Yellowing may also occur from overexertion, accompanied by excessive phlegm and snot, red veins in the eyes, increased pallor, or facial redness with nausea. Use one tael of gentian, compounded into two doses, each using half a pound of wine, soaked and squeezed to extract the juice, to be taken on an empty stomach. This method may also yield convenience. Among these, those who are easy to treat with diet often find repeated applications effective.</p>
<p>Jaundice leads to yellowing both internally and externally, with red urination, and feelings of agitation and dry mouth: use three taels of gentian, one large sheng of cow&#39;s milk, boil for seven portions, and take again when warm. The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; add six qian of mirabilite.</p>
<p>Damp-heat jaundice: one tael of bupleurum and two and a half qian of licorice, made into one dose, with one cup of water and a handful of white sorgum root, decoct until reduced to seven parts, to be consumed freely at any time.</p>
<p>The five types of jaundice include: common jaundice, grain jaundice, alcohol jaundice, female jaundice, and labor jaundice. Sweating jaundice occurs due to profuse sweating and entering water, leading to slight body swelling, with sweat resembling yellow berberine juice. Use one handful of fresh sorgum root, finely chopped, with one pound of pork, to prepare a porridge.</p>
<p>Grain jaundice is acquired through diet; labor jaundice is acquired through exertion. Use one tael of gentian and three taels of bitter cucumber mixed into powder, combined with cow bile to form pills the size of a jujube, and consume five pills prior to meals with wheat drink, three times a day, without stopping until slightly increased. For labor jaundice, add one tael of gentian, three to seven seeds of gardenia, mixed with pig bile to form pills for consumption.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Family Care&quot; states: In Caizhai, there was a boy of fifteen years old, suffering from jaundice for a year. His face was as yellow as gold, his body swollen and weak, and he could only eat salt and burnt food. A practitioner used tea to mix a powder, which made him vomit a bowl of phlegm. Later, in the evening, he took seven to eight pills of a certain medicine and three qian of another mixture, which he expelled in four to five actions. After waiting six to seven days, he took more pills and another mixture, expelling four to five actions again. He began to detest salt and burnt food, and his complexion turned red. Afterwards, he used tea to induce vomiting again, bringing out two sheng of phlegm, which finally led to his recovery.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a man who developed a lump while suffering from jaundice. He had a good appetite but was thin, unable to lift his limbs, and his face was yellow and weak. His mother-in-law wanted to abandon him, but his daughter refused, saying: &quot;I have already borne two sons; how can I marry another?&quot; The mother-in-law, who was originally a farmer, wanted her son-in-law to work hard, but seeing his severe illness, she scolded him daily. People suggested he take gallbladder pills and a mixture with three angles, but they were of no help. Acupuncture and spells brought no relief either. </p>
<p>A practitioner saw him and treated him without diagnosis, administering an expelling agent that removed a斗 (about 10 liters) of stagnant phlegm and water. He then prescribed a laxative pill and another mixture, causing him to expel four to five dozen times. The practitioner ordered him to drink a bowl of ice water, which immediately stopped the expulsion. He next took a remedy for the stomach and intermittently took betel nut pills. After five to seven days, his yellow complexion faded and strength returned. The symptoms of jaundice from the spleen were due to damp heat clashing with accumulated food, commonly referred to as &quot;food labor jaundice.&quot;<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the sixth month of the year Bingyin during the Yuan dynasty, there was continuous rain, and many people fell ill with epidemics. Han Junxiang from Zhen Ding, due to overexertion, drank cold tea and ate cold foods, leading to a headache, pain in his limbs and joints, a feeling of heaviness in his body, fullness in his chest, and inability to eat. He believed it was an external sickness and took Tongsheng powder twice. After taking the medicine, his body felt even more fatigued, prompting him to seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>The doctor administered a hundred relief powder to induce sweating; four days later, he took Xiao Chai Hu decoction twice, but his agitation, fever, and thirst worsened. Six days later, he was given San Yi Cheng Qi decoction, exacerbating his agitation and thirst. Other prescriptions like Bai Hu decoction with ginseng and Chai Hu infusion were administered, but his condition only deteriorated. </p>
<p>He changed doctors, who prescribed Huang Lian Jie Du decoction, Zhu Sha ointment, and Zhi Bao pill among others. By the seventeenth day, the illness progressed, showing yellowing of skin and eyes, heaviness in limbs, chills in the back, cold skin, hardness and pain upon pressing the area under the heart, dry eyes that did not wish to open, a tendency to be mute, spontaneous sweating, small loose stools, and incomplete bowel movements. I was ordered to treat him, and upon examining his pulse, it was tight and thin, and when pressed felt hollow. The pulse at the two-inch point was short and inadequate. This condition arose from the combination of seasonal heat and excessive drinking of cold beverages, compounded by an overuse of cold medicines, causing the liver (wood) to overpower the heart, which in turn weakened the spleen (earth). </p>
<p>As the classics state: &quot;The one who is weak is overpowered by the one who is strong.&quot; It was the season of continuous rain, leading to a combination of cold and dampness, which manifested as a yin condition causing jaundice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Cold infiltrates within; it is treated with sweet warmth, complemented by bitter and pungent agents. When dampness dominates, it must be balanced with bitter heat, diluted with mildness, and dried with bitterness. Aconite and dried ginger are strongly warm and spicy, dispersing the internal cold, thus they are used as the primary ingredients. Pinellia and cardamom are spicy and warm, while white atractylodes and aged tangerine peel are bitter, sweet, and warm, helping to strengthen the spleen and dry dampness, hence they serve as the secondary ingredients. Fresh ginger is spicy and warm to disperse, while licorice is sweet and neutral to help with infiltration. Bitter orange, being slightly cool and bitter, helps relieve fullness, while Artemisia capillaris is slightly cool and bitter, and its light nature helps; paired with ginger and aconite, it can expel cold dampness from the skin and body, thus serving as an assistant. Take one or two doses; if symptoms reduce by half, continue for complete relief. Additionally, take it with the Regulate the Middle Decoction for several days until the energy stabilizes.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some may find it difficult to understand: Why is it thought that yellow indicates heat, and yet during the peak of summer, one uses heat-clearing medicine to treat it? I say: It is natural and must be this way. Cheng Wujǐ states: There are two types of yin syndromes: One arises from external cold pathogens injuring the yin channels, or from consuming cold food, thus harming the Taiyin channel. The second occurs when one initially contracts a yang syndrome, and then treats it with cold, which, if excessive, transforms yang into yin. Now, you have the condition of Mr. Xiang, caused by the summer heat; the consumption of cold food harms the spleen, and overindulgence in cold leads to a dominance of yin qi, with yang qi on the verge of collapse. Additionally, with the convergence of continual rain and cold humidity, it manifests as yellow. This correlates with what Zhongjing said about seeking it amid cold and damp. Li Sishun comments: To resolve it with excessive cold and coolness, or to purge it and chase out the intruder harms the host—this is precisely the case. The sages&#39; principles should not be carelessly neglected!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Treatise&quot; states: A woman aged sixty suffers from shivering and chills, indicating cold in the foot&#39;s solar channels; yawning and sneezing relate to the foot&#39;s lesser yang and gallbladder; lack of saliva in her mouth suggests deficiency in the foot&#39;s yang brightness; there is acute pain and fullness in the heart, with the hand&#39;s lesser yin affected by cold, and stagnation of blood in the foot&#39;s lesser yin. She feels hot but desires proximity to fire, showing heat on the skin while cold resides in the bones. There is cold and discomfort below the navel, indicating cold in the lower dantian; her whole body and eyes show yellow, a sign of cold dampness. I have confirmed this and know it to be cold. Frequent yellow, red, and dark urination denotes excessive cold dampness. When the illness causes her body to feel heavy like a mountain, she immediately lies on her bed; this indicates excess of yin dampness. The pulse at the right wrist shows a thin string at the gate of life and heartbeat; pressing reveals it is strong and string-like. A tense string signifies cold; if it is also delicate, it indicates northern cold waters; if mixed with a very slow pulse, this shows excess dampness leading to yellowish conditions. A strong and broad pulse indicates heart fire is constrained. Pressing the left wrist down to the bone and noting fullness in the hand indicates vitality in the kidneys (water). If all six pulses are empty, there is no yang present in the lower source. As for treatment, I first recommend light doses to dispel the cold dampness, while also reducing the strong pulse, using a formula combining licorice with poria cooked in water to serve cool. This addresses heat brought on by cold, using fictitious cold against the foot&#39;s solar channels&#39; false heat and applies the spicy warm properties of ginger to disperse the bladder&#39;s true qi, thus saying true against true, false against false. If there is no improvement, I would then prescribe a decoction of atractylodes and aconite. Although this condition presents with yellow and red urination, it still calls for cold treatment based on further symptom analysis and pulse examination.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

Zhongjing states: In cases of dampness causing body pain, with fever, a yellowish face, shortness of breath, headaches, and nasal congestion, the pulse is large, and the person can still eat. There are no issues in the abdomen, indicating that the illness lies in the head; cold dampness attacking the nose causes the blockage. Medicines taken through the nose can alleviate it. Zhongjing does not provide a prescription, but this formula appears in the &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; which discusses treating the heat from seasonal epidemics. It likely harmonizes the cold dampness throughout the organs, penetrating deep into the marrow, and might cause jaundice; hence, the Guati powder is appropriate, which is this formula.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

The urine was red and frequent, while the bowel movements were normal. Some suggested using Yinchen and Wuling, but I said that was not the correct treatment. With normal bowel movements, it indicates the illness is not in the organs. Now, with pain in the eyes and nose, the issue lies within the pathways of the lungs. If Da Huang (rhubarb) is administered, it would certainly cause abdominal distension as a side effect. One could also use Guati San by first dissolving it in water, then placing it in the nose until the yellow fluid is completely cleared.</p>
<p>Zhao Zongyan, after excessive purging, developed jaundice with a pulse that was deep, thin, slow, and weak. Gradually, different medicines were administered, reaching Yinchen and Fuzi Decoction, which produced great effects. For the gradual approach, it meant first administering Han&#39;s Yinchen and Fuling Decoction, then moving on to Yinchen and Chenpi Decoction, and finally to Yinchen and Fuzi Decoction. Later, Scholar Zhao followed this method step by step. Due to early purging, he experienced jaundice, with a weak and shallow pulse and a cold body. He gradually took medication until reaching Yinchen and Sini Decoction, which had great effects.</p>
<p>A monk with a cold had not fully sweated out the illness and retained heat, causing his entire face and body to turn yellow and suffer from excessive heat, with a year passing without recovery.

Subsequently, this medicine was given. After five days, his condition improved by one third; after ten days, two thirds; and after twenty days, the illness was completely gone. The formula used was three parts of Yinchen and Zhi Zi, and four qian each of Qin Jiao and Sheng Ma, ground into a powder.

I prescribed Wei Ling Decoction, removed the cinnamon, and added Yin Chen, using several dozen medicated plasters to reduce the yellowing. He thought himself cured and did not take the medication. After ten days, by evening, his vision failed completely. I said: This is called &quot;sparrow&#39;s eye.&quot; It is due to excessive damp phlegm and excess liver fire. I instructed him to cook pig liver and mix it with Ming Sha into pills to take, and his vision returned to normal. He came to thank me. I said: Not yet. If you do not take the liver-regulating, spleen-nourishing, phlegm-dispelling medicine early, it will certainly turn into bloating. He did not believe me, but after half a month, his abdomen gradually became bloated and full, and he sought treatment again. I prescribed Wei Ling Decoction once more, doubling the herbs, adding Mu Tong and Mai Men Dong, and prepared a decoction to take with the gold-reducing pills. After a month, he was well.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: The Grand Minister Li Pu Ting, a junior official from the Ministry of Personnel, was then suffering from jaundice and should have been treated with a light draining medicine. However, he hesitated due to his lack of heirs. I said: If you have this illness, you should use this medicine. I prescribed Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder with the addition of Qian, Lian, and Shan Zhi, and he recovered. In the year of Xin Mao, he had a son and took my hand, laughing, saying: A doctor&#39;s prescription is like a public case; if you avoid slanderous remarks, how could you enjoy your remaining years and entrust them to others? From then on, he treated me with even greater respect.</p>
<p>The governor of Yingtian suffered from full-body yellowing, spoke wildly, and endured severe chest pain, which was problematic due to blood accumulation in the middle burner.

[Note: Yellow is the color of central earth.] **From the Yujizhen Zang Lun** Wind is the chief of all diseases. When wind and cold invade a person, it causes the hair to stand straight and the skin to close, resulting in heat. At this time, one may sweat and expel it. If there is numbness and swelling, one may use hot compresses or fire needling to remove it. If untreated, the liver transmits this to the spleen, resulting in a condition called \"spleen wind.\" Jaundice occurs when there is heat in the abdomen, leading to worry and yellow excretion. [Note: Jaundice arises from external damp heat. Heat in the abdomen leads to worry and yellow excretion, indicating internal heat.] **From the Pingren Qixiang Lun** If someone is yellow and lies down in comfort, it is jaundice. If after eating they feel hungry, it is stomach jaundice. If the eyes are yellow, it is known as jaundice.

The pulse at the foot yang is tight and rapid; rapid indicates heat, which depletes nourishment, while tight indicates cold, leading to fullness upon eating. The floating pulse at the inch indicates kidney damage, and the tight pulse at the foot yang indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold clash, consuming grains leads to dizziness, and the grain energy fails to dissipate, resulting in a bitter, turbid stomach; the turbidity descends, causing difficulty in urination. The yin is afflicted by cold, heat flows to the bladder, and the body turns entirely yellow, known as grain jaundice. If the forehead is dark, there is slight sweating, and the hands and feet feel warm, this arises at dusk, with urgent bladder symptoms and spontaneous urination, termed female labor jaundice. If the abdomen presents a watery appearance, it should not be treated. If there is a feeling of vexation and heat in the heart, with difficulty eating and a desire to vomit, it is called alcoholic jaundice. For yangming disease, if the pulse is slow, eating becomes difficult, and fullness causes agitation and dizziness, with urination notably difficult, this indicates the onset of grain jaundice. Even with purging, the abdomen remains distended, attributed to the slow pulse. In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there must be difficulty in urination; accompanying signs include heat in the heart and warmth in the feet. For alcoholic jaundice, some may lack heat, but their words are clear; the abdomen feels full and there is a desire to vomit, with a dry nose.

The teacher said: For those suffering from yellow jaundice, with fever, restlessness, and shortness of breath, these symptoms arise from the illness, where fire consumes the sweat and both heats are at play. However, yellow jaundice is obtained from dampness. When the entire body feels overheated, with a yellow face and a hot belly, it must be treated immediately.

For granular jaundice, there will be cold and heat with loss of appetite. Eating will cause dizziness and discomfort in the chest; prolonged yellowing indicates granular jaundice, which is primarily treated with the Yinchaihao Decoction. In women, when jaundice appears in the afternoon with fever followed by chills, it results from labor. There will be urgency in the bladder and fullness in the lower abdomen.

It is mainly caused by excessive sweating followed by sudden immersion in water. **Yellow Jaundice**: The entire body and face turn yellow like an orange. It is caused by exposure to heat and then being washed with cold water, leaving heat in the stomach, which is further aggravated by eating cucumbers. If it develops into black jaundice, the prognosis is poor. **Grain Jaundice**: After eating, one may feel dizzy, and there is an uneasy and repressed sensation in the heart along with yellowing of the skin. This results from neglecting hunger, leading to large meals, causing gas to rise and accumulate in the stomach. **Wine Jaundice**: This condition involves heart pain, swelling in the legs and shins, yellow urine, and reddish-yellow spots on the face, arising from excessive drunkenness combined with exposure to wind and water. **Female Labor Jaundice**: The body and eyes are both yellow, accompanied by fever and chills, a distended lower abdomen, and difficulty urinating. This occurs due to excessive labor and heat, culminating in immersion in water. When it comes to the disease of wet jaundice, its initial presentation involves body pain, fever, and a black-yellow complexion.

Dampness flows into the joints, causing bodily discomfort, with a pulse that is deep and slow, indicating \"middle dampness,\" which results in overall pain, fever, and yellow skin. If urination is smooth, a remedy like Atractylodes and Prepared Aconite Decoction is appropriate. However, if urination is difficult and bowel movements are frequent, it is necessary to promote urination; in this case, Licorice and Aconite Decoction or Wuling Powder should be used. The patient has internal cold dampness that has not dissipated, heat accumulating in the spleen and stomach, blocked pores, and stagnant heat mingling with undigested food, hence the yellowing. Both yellowing and blood stasis have similar outward signs and pulse indications, but difficulty in urination is associated with yellowing, while smooth urination indicates blood stasis. In essence, a person with yellowing has accumulation in the heart and spleen, leading to fever that prompts thirst; the pulse is likely to be floating, slippery, and rapid. In contrast, the blood stasis condition resembles mania, and the stool will be black; this distinction is key. When a patient feels feverish, has sweating on the forehead while the body remains dry, and experiences thirst with difficulty in urination, this will certainly lead to yellowing; the appropriate prescription is Yinchenhao Decoction with Wuling Powder.

This condition is treated with the Poria Decoction with modifications. The stagnation of the spleen is called \"repression qi,\" located in the gastric cavity, which is large like a cup. If it does not heal for a long time, it leads to limbs not retracting, causes jaundice, and food fails to nourish the skin. According to Zhongjing, if there is only sweating from the head and none from the body, with discomfort in the neck and difficulty in urination, and thirst for water, then the body will surely turn yellow. This indicates that heat is present at the surface, being dry and without sweat, while damp-heat is inside. The qi is so obstructed that it cannot disperse outward; thus, the damp-heat qi becomes extremely repressed and ascends, leading to the face and head showing signs of extreme yang. As a result, damp-heat condenses into slight sweating, but there is no sweat below the neck. However, damp-heat cannot naturally disperse and circulate throughout the body, leading to severe repression, causing the complexion to turn yellow.

In society, there is a belief that cauterization for jaundice may lead to recovery; however, this applies to individuals with strong constitutions who do not have weakened middle qi, but merely mild damp-heat stagnation. If cauterization is misapplied, it could forcibly open the channels, leading to a release of qi and blood, resulting in sweating and recovery. Conversely, in individuals with inherently weak constitutions, if damp-heat is severe, forcible opening may lead instead to death, which is not rare. It is preferable to use Zhang Jing's methods to treat the condition with medicine, avoiding the risks of a violent intervention that may endanger life. Furthermore, recent misconceptions have circulated that extreme cold and severe jaundice are to be salvaged by rescuing the yang, which has caused numerous harms.

The classical texts state: when dampness and heat intersect, the people will suffer from “tan” (jaundice). “Tan” refers to yellow; it is the manifestation of pure yang without yin. When cold damage leads to jaundice, it signifies a severe condition. When damp heat is intense, jaundice will appear; when internal heat is already strong and is further aggravated by fire, jaundice will also manifest. If the evil wind combines with fire heat, the two forms of yang will scorch each other, leading to jaundice. In cases of yangming disease, if there is slight sweating on the forehead and the urination is obstructed, jaundice must occur. This is due to internal heat combined with fire leading to jaundice. In yangming disease, if there is no sweating, obstructed urination, and a feeling of frustration in the heart, jaundice must occur. This is due to excess heat in yangming causing jaundice. If cold damage has caused sweating and the body and eyes turn yellow, the reason is that the cold dampness inside has not been resolved, as one cannot eliminate it through purging; jaundice is sought amidst cold dampness. This is jaundice caused by cold dampness. Both dampness and heat may lead to jaundice; can one distinguish between them? The two differ not only in their fundamental nature but also in their appearance. The jaundice from dampness is like a smoky yellow, dark and unclear despite its yellow hue.

Although the internal heat may be strong, if there is already sweating and ease of urination, it will not lead to yellowing. If the head is sweating but the body doesn't, with a reaction in the neck and difficulty in urination, along with thirst for water, this signifies stagnation of heat internally, and the body will definitely turn yellow.

Therefore, there are methods for opening the Ghost Gate and purifying the Rectum. Opening the Ghost Gate allows heat to leak through the surface of the skin via sweat. Purifying the Rectum releases dampness through urination. This clarifies the fundamental principles of diagnosis and treatment, with intricate details found only in the “Classic of the Gold Coffer.” It is essential to understand that the yellowing caused by external factors is fully elaborated in the \"Treatise on Cold Damage,\" particularly in the Yangming chapter. Though the \"Classic of the Gold Coffer\" mentions both external and internal causes of jaundice, it emphasizes the importance of internal injuries. Here, I will elaborate for future learners. The \"Classic of the Gold Coffer\" discusses jaundice resulting from internal heat stagnation caused by external pathogens, stating: \"The pulse at the cun position is floating and slow; floating indicates wind, and slow indicates stasis. Stasis is not true wind, but the limbs feel heavy and there is a yellowish complexion, resulting from stagnant heat.\" This means that the interaction of wind and dampness in cold damage leads to this manifestation; although wind is generally good at mobilizing, when it combines with dampness, it becomes stagnant and does not move, resulting only in heat stagnation."},{"anchor":"trans-36p","marker":"36p","type":"translation","text":"When the condition of the liver reaches its extreme, the nature of wind begins to emerge. The wind consequently carries the stagnant heat to the limbs, causing them to feel troubled, revealing the signs of wind-induced minor ailments. It also carries the stagnant heat to the skin, causing a yellowish hue, which indicates the signs of dampness penetrating from the outside. The pulse is superficial due to the wind generating heat, and weak because of dampness causing obstruction. At this point, the methods from the \"Inner Canon\" should be employed to open the pathways and cleanse the body, allowing the heat carried by the wind to be released from the surface of the skin, and the damp yellow to be expelled through urination, thereby clarifying the distinction between the exterior and interior. The \"Synopsis of Golden Coffer\" mentions that when a Yangming disease does not resolve after exposure to cold, it may result in a condition known as grain stagnation. If the pulse is slow, eating becomes difficult, leading to fullness; fullness results in agitation, dizziness, and difficulty urinating. This indicates an impending condition of grain stagnation. Even with treatment, the abdomen remains distended, which is attributed to the pulse being slow. The lingering heat in the Yangming stomach from external sources remains present, complicating digestion. When full, the food generates further heat, and the combination of the two heats leads to agitation, dizziness, difficulty in urination, and abdominal distension, making it inevitable. In the case of Yangming syndrome, one should typically purge, especially if there is significant abdominal distension. However, in this specific scenario, purging will not alleviate the distension; rather, it may increase discomfort. This is due to the pulse being slow and the stomach being empty, with fluids not being sufficient. The fullness is merely a manifestation of internal excess heat, not an accumulation of solid heat in need of purging. The repetition of this principle in the \"Synopsis of Golden Coffer\" carries profound meaning, indicating that when the pulse is slow and the stomach is weak, purging is not only ineffective but the methods to open the pathways and cleanse the body will also prove useless, which goes without saying."},{"anchor":"trans-37p","marker":"37p","type":"translation","text":"I remember a friend once asked: Zhang Zhongjing said that if the lower abdomen is still full as before, why not establish a treatment method? I replied: Zhang Zhongjing must use harmonizing methods. First harmonize internally, and only then can one purge it. My friend asked: How do you know this? I said: Zhang Zhongjing states that if the pulse is slow, it is not yet time to attack. The meaning of \"harmonizing\" clearly indicates the intention to resolve it. The \"Jin Kui\" also says that for those with yellow abdominal pain and vomiting, one should use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. Observing this, it still treats the evil of cold damage causing high pain below, hence leading to vomiting. The sweet decoction of Xiao Chai is the method for this, which is why I know. Chen Wuzhe treated food stasis with a decoction of malt and bitter orange combined with Xiao Chai Hu, slightly recognizing this principle. However, using half of each method—half resolving, half harmonizing, and half purging—all together without order, is far from the meticulous approach of Zhang Zhongjing. The \"Jin Kui\" also states: When the pulse at the foot yang is tight and rapid, rapid indicates heat, and heat causes food to not digest; tightness indicates cold, and fullness arises from food. A floating pulse at the chi position indicates kidney damage, while a tight pulse at the foot yang indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold clash, eating grain leads to dizziness. If the grain energy does not dissipate, it causes bitter and turbid conditions in the stomach, with turbid qi flowing down, leading to obstructed urination. The cold affects the yin, heat flows into the bladder, and the body turns completely yellow; this condition is called food stasis. This discussion on internal injury causing yellowing is truly an unprecedented marvel. Dong Yuan's \"Discussion on the Spleen and Stomach\" somewhat resembles one-tenth of this, and later generations delight in the sect, disregarding the profound meanings of the \"Jin Kui,\" which is truly lamentable."},{"anchor":"trans-38p","marker":"38p","type":"translation","text":"Please elaborate! The human body’s spleen and stomach reside in the central region. The spleen, representing the earth, is Yin in nature but functions as Yang; the stomach, representing the earth, is Yang in nature but functions as Yin. When these two are harmonized, neither too rigid nor too yielding exists. The stomach receives food, while the spleen processes the essence of grains, regulating the waterways and nourishing the various channels, achieving great utility. However, the seven emotions, along with hunger, fullness, and exertion, when excessive, cause internal harm, leading to a disharmony between the Yin and Yang of the spleen and stomach. If the stomach leans towards Yang without the Yin of the spleen to harmonize it, it is akin to nature experiencing summer without winter, accumulating heat alone and digesting grains inadequately. If the spleen leans towards Yin without the Yang of the stomach to harmonize it, it is like nature undergoing winter without summer, accumulating cold alone and leading to bloating. Those having a tense and rapid pulse in the Yang veins will surely exhibit clear signs. Diagnosing whether the pulse is tense or rapid reveals that the spleen and stomach govern the illness. If both tense and rapid, it indicates that the spleen and stomach share in the affliction, as the principle states accurately. Yet, there is a deeper understanding. If the pulse in both wrists is floating, it also suggests damage to the kidneys. The kidney pulse is inherently deep, so why is it floating? This is because the kidneys store essence, and essence is produced from grains. If the spleen fails to transport what’s in the stomach, the grain essence enters the kidneys, leading to a lack of nourishment for the essence and resultant kidney damage, which causes the deep pulse to become floating. Knowing the floating pulse in the wrists indicates kidney harm leads to the understanding that the tense Yang pulse indicates spleen injury. However, tension pertains to the liver pulse, aligning with what Zhongjing stated—that tension is like a bowstring. When the spleen pulse is loose, and it is affected by the liver wood’s overgrowth, it becomes tense."},{"anchor":"trans-39p","marker":"39p","type":"translation","text":"The wind from the liver, combined with the coldness from the spleen, clash with each other, causing dizziness upon consuming grains. When grains enter and cannot thrive in the stomach's yang, they instead generate wind in the spleen's yin. The heat that gathers in the stomach and dissipates the grains merely turns them into a putrid, turbid qi, rather than pure essence. This turbid qi flows down from the stomach's heat into the bladder, resulting in heat obstructing the bladder's function, leading to difficulty in urination and a yellow complexion throughout the body. If the turbid qi flows down from the spleen's cold into the kidneys, the kidneys will be affected by this cold, and their excess will cause abdominal fullness. Ultimately, the condition of grain stagnation most often arises from stomach heat harming the bladder, while only about two or three in ten cases stem from spleen cold harming the kidneys. If food injures the spleen and is compounded by sexual exhaustion damaging the kidneys, the symptoms will inevitably lead to abdominal fullness that is difficult to treat. Zhongjing reiterated the principle regarding female conditions and abdominal heaviness, stating: \"The abdomen is water-like and untreated.\" Is this not profoundly clear? For female conditions of abdominal heaviness, the forehead appears dark, indicating a yellow body with an additional dark forehead. Black, as a color of the north's darkness, added to the brightness of the south, signifies that there must first be turbid qi from stomach heat and spleen cold flowing down to the kidneys, compounded by excessive female labor, leading to this condition; its origins are not from just one day.

Therefore, the turbid gas within the spleen descends and enters the kidneys, the colors of water and earth reveal themselves, but in the yellow there is only black stagnation. If the fire of the heart rises from the water and joins with the sovereign fire of the heart, its force can spread like wildfire, the smoke and flames first manifest on the forehead, to the point where even a slight sweat will emerge from there, causing the heart's fluid to be drained. The heat in the hands and feet is the same; the internal injuries are just as dire. At dusk, when yangming is at work, yangming governs closure and gathers the damp heat of the entire body, hastily descending, the bladder consequently gives urgent signals, with smooth urination, and dark stools signify a retention of blood in the bladder. The abdomen appears water-like, but it is not water; it specifically refers to the retention of blood, hence it is not treated. Alcoholic stagnation creates heat and bitterness in the heart, causing inability to eat and occasional urges to vomit. Alcohol is the most detrimental of damp and heat, as its energy returns to the heart and lungs, its taste is attributed to the spleen and stomach. When the heat accumulates for a long time, if it does not descend but instead rises, it leads to bitterness and blockage in the middle jiao, resulting in an inability to eat. If the damp heat does not descend but rises, it causes vomiting. When vomiting occurs, the direction reverses and accumulates throughout the body. The \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" states that if yangming disease has no sweating, if urination is not smooth, and if there is bitterness in the heart, the body is sure to turn yellow. This indicates that if the heat within is intense, it can lead to this condition, and it is not solely due to alcohol. The \"Golden Cabinet\" states regarding the treatment of alcoholic stagnation, using methods of either inducing vomiting or purging, that alcoholic yellow stagnation will surely lead to unsmooth urination, with heat felt in the heart and heat in the feet being the symptoms."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"It is also said: If there is no heat but clear speech, fullness in the abdomen with a desire to vomit, and a dark nose, then one should first induce vomiting for those with a floating pulse, and first purge for those with a deep and taut pulse.

Furthermore, if there is vexation in the heart or heat causing pain, the prescription of Gardenia and Rhubarb decoction should be used. Moreover, if purging leads to prolonged black stool, this indicates a deeper issue. Although words may be expressed differently, the meaning is consistent. When the heat from alcohol accumulates in the bladder, the qi cannot flow, which leads to difficulty in urination; if it accumulates in the upper burner, it causes heat in the heart; if it accumulates in the lower burner, it causes heat in the feet. If there is no heat in the heart or feet, and the speech is clear and the spirit is not clouded, but there is fullness in the abdomen, a desire to vomit, and dark nasal discharge, it indicates a mixed disorder of yin and yang in the stomach and abdomen. Treatment must be sequentially divided, distinguishing between the floating and deep pulses to determine whether to induce vomiting or to purge first. A floating pulse indicates disease in the upper burner, with more yang present, so one should first induce vomiting for fullness in the upper burner and then treat the fullness in the middle. A deep and taut pulse indicates disease in the abdomen, with more yin present, so one should first alleviate the fullness in the middle and then treat the upper burner. However, if the heat in the heart leads to a desire to vomit, the issue is entirely in the upper burner. Inducing vomiting will provide relief, so why focus on purging? If heat from alcohol causes inner binding, leading to confusion of the spirit and feelings of vexation and pain, then purging is necessary. But purging is a method that depletes the disease, and should not be used for long.

The \"vital\" refers to the essence of water and grains, which becomes stagnant due to damp heat, turning its brilliance into dullness. The chest feels tumultuous like chewing garlic, and its sweet flavor transforms to sour and spicy. Moreover, the skin becomes insensate to touch, the stools are notably dark, and the pulse is weak and floating—all indicating a blockage of lung qi and stagnation of blood. To restore the clear and purifying qi of the lungs is necessary to drive out the impure blood within the vital essence. This condition is relatively easier to treat than female labor intoxication. The prescriptions merely recommend the use of Baizhu Decoction to regulate spleen qi and resolve the heat of alcohol; what an inept approach! Hypertension arises from the heat and dampness of fire and earth. If it coincides with the dryness of the Yangming channel, the combination of these three opposing energies produces a yellow coloration in the individual, who will inevitably experience thirst and drink water. In this case, one must enhance the moistening and drying herbs within the damp-heat formulas to achieve proper transformation and flow of fluids in the three burners, thereby alleviating thirst and eliminating the yellow hue. If thirst persists, it indicates that dryness has not yet been resolved, but it is not a terminal condition. Why, then, is it said that thirst associated with intoxication is difficult to treat?

Understanding these four types exhausts the discussion on jaundice. Danxi stated that jaundice does not necessarily have to be divided into five types; it is all damp-heat, akin to the similarity of curving in nature. Can we truly say that all such instances are merely damp-heat? This is insufficient as evidence. I foolishly categorize them as follows: Yang jaundice occurs when excessive dampness leads to heat; heat then produces jaundice, which is what we call a damp-heat syndrome. However, its symptoms must include fever, thirst, restlessness, increased appetite, or signs of painful and burning urination, or constipation. Its pulse will be strong and slippery. This condition does not strictly adhere to exterior or interior influences; it can arise from either external wind-dampness or internal injury from food and drink. Yet, if one observes that the vital energy remains strong and the spleen and stomach are not harmed, while damp-heat is indeed severe, the correct approach is to clear the heat and promote urination. Once the damp-heat is eliminated, the jaundice will diminish. Treating this condition is not difficult.

Consequently, the color of the spleen's earth phase is revealed externally. In this condition, the patient prefers rest and dislikes movement, seeks darkness and fears brightness. Symptoms include mental fatigue, slight speech, possible dizziness and vertigo, aversion to cold and reduced appetite, weakness in the limbs, or unformed stools and urine like oil, along with a weak pulse—these are all signs of Yang deficiency. This stands in contrast to jaundice caused by damp-heat, which is like ice versus fire; if the original Qi is not quickly restored and the spleen and kidneys are not significantly nourished, there is no possibility of recovery. Additionally, these cases are most common; if one sees only yellow coloration without assessing pulse and symptoms, and hastily concludes it is jaundice, treating it as damp-heat with herbs like gardenia or gentian to clear heat and promote urination, there will inevitably be fatal outcomes following the treatment. The yellowing from exterior pathogens is actually a sign of a cold damage syndrome. In cases where cold damage leads to sweating that cannot penetrate and wind-damp is present on the surface, there can be yellow symptoms; or if the exterior pathogen is unresolved, transmitting internally and damp-heat is constrained in the Yangming, yellow symptoms can also occur."},{"anchor":"trans-46p","marker":"46p","type":"translation","text":"Those who have not resolved the external邪 will definitely experience fever, body pain, floating pulse, and slight sweating; they should be treated by inducing sweat to disperse the邪.

If there is a real邪 pressing on the Yangming, causing fullness and distension, treatment should first focus on purging it, and then clearing away the residual heat to ensure complete recovery. As for yellow bile syndrome, it occurs with great fright or injury from fighting. I have seen cases where someone, terrified by a tiger or wolf, lost courage suddenly and fell ill with yellowness; such cases develop rapidly. There are also cases caused by harsh officials or fears of disaster, where constant terror leads to gradual illness; such cases develop more slowly. During the 11th year of the Yongming era in the Qi dynasty, a student named Wei Zhun died from excessive fright, his whole body turned blue, and people believed it was due to a broken gallbladder, exemplifying this phenomenon. I have also observed cases of yellowness developing gradually after brawls, caused by gallbladder injury. The symptoms are characterized by absence of fire and dampness, with patients feeling lethargic and drowsy, and their complexion appearing a uniform yellow as if dyed. All of these symptoms stem from gallbladder injury; when the gallbladder is harmed, its energy is depleted, leading to leakage of bile, hence the manifestation of these symptoms.

Although they have such distinctions, they ultimately fall into the categories of yin and yang. Generally, yang conditions are more solid, while yin conditions tend to be more deficient. Understanding this distinction between deficiency and excess captures the essence. Difficult-to-treat jaundice conditions include: no pulse at the wrist, cold sweat at the nose, a body resembling one smudged by smoke, unsteady head with fixed gaze, dark black around the mouth, yellow oily sweat, and a long-term blackening of the skin—all of which are difficult to treat."},{"anchor":"trans-48p","marker":"48p","type":"translation","text":"**On Treatment** Yang jaundice is often caused by dampness in the spleen leading to obstructed heat.

The next day, half a dose of the artemisia and aconite decoction was administered, their limbs became warm, they urinated two to three liters, and they sweated profusely on that day, resulting in recovery. Cases like this are too numerous to list individually. In cases of cold damage with jaundice, it is often associated with the celestial bodies of the sun or the moon. If purged excessively, it often turns to a severe jaundice. The presence of the Chen and Xu (the hours of the day associated with the sun) indicates cold water in charge, which invades the earth; for the Chou and Wei (the hours associated with the moon), damp earth is in charge, leading to insufficient earth energy, resulting in spleen and stomach weakness. This allows water to invade, frequently resulting in this condition. Jaundice from cold damage often arises from damp heat. Symptoms may include difficulty with small urination, either yellow or red urine, a distended but painless lower abdomen, or firm stools with extreme thirst. The pulse is deep, solid, and strong, indicating damp heat. For mild cases, a formula of artemisia and five grain dispersal may be sufficient; for severe cases, the artemisia decoction can be used to promote urination, clear the blood, and eliminate heat, thus causing the jaundice to recede. However, there are also cases of yin jaundice with different treatment methods; these are detailed above and should be referred to accordingly."},{"anchor":"trans-52p","marker":"52p","type":"translation","text":"**Secret Prescriptions of the Stone Chamber** **By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty** **On Jaundice** The symptoms of jaundice include yellowing of the entire body and eyes, which indicates a death sentence. However, if treated at the onset, it may not necessarily lead to death. I possess a remarkable formula called the Decoction to Eliminate Jaundice and Resolve Dampness. It consists of three qian of Artemisia, three liang each of Job's tears and Plantago seeds, two liang of Poria, and three fen of cinnamon, which is to be boiled and consumed. After four doses, the jaundice will disappear and the dampness will resolve. Although jaundice arises from damp heat, the root cause is ultimately a deficiency of the spleen that fails to regulate and eliminate water and dampness, resulting in stagnation and jaundice. I prescribe large doses of Poria, Job's tears, and Plantago as the chief ingredients to dispel water dampness while also being fortifying for the spleen and qi; a small amount of Artemisia is used to resolve damp heat, and the cinnamon is included to guide it to the bladder for elimination through urination, subtly addressing the damp heat in the process. This formula is both light and exquisite, simple yet miraculous. After the first four doses, reduce the amount by half and add one liang of Atractylodes, then brew and drink. Use another four doses, and they will recover completely without subsequent issues.

Indeed, jaundice caused by external dampness is easily treated, while those from internal injury are difficult to heal. In cases of external dampness, simply treating the dampness can lead to the recovery from jaundice, whereas treating internal injury solely for dampness makes recovery from jaundice challenging. Purging water diminishes vital energy, and inducing sweat causes loss of essence. How can one expect a rapid recovery from jaundice? I have a remedy that treats internal injury causing jaundice, called the Internal Dissipation Jaundice Decoction. It consists of one tael each of Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria, and Job’s tears, two qian each of Artemisia capillaris and fried Gardenia fruit, and five fen of dried tangerine peel, all boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this prescription lies in the abundant use of Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria, and Job’s tears, which strengthen the spleen and facilitate water metabolism, assisting Artemisia capillaris and Gardenia fruit in dissipating dampness and heat, all from within the bladder, without the need to additionally expel the dampness from the skin, which will resolve itself. Generally, using this formula for ten doses will result in complete dissipation; it is not necessary to exceed ten doses. After ten doses, reduce to half, eliminate the Gardenia fruit, and take five more doses for full recovery; the person will be strong and vigorous. This is a remarkably effective and miraculous remedy, beneficial and harmless, suitable for treating those with internal injury compounded by dampness.

As the classics state: \"The one who is weak is overpowered by the one who is strong.\" It was the season of continuous rain, leading to a combination of cold and dampness, which manifested as a yin condition causing jaundice. I prescribed Yin Chen Fuzi Ganjiang decoction to treat him."},{"anchor":"trans-108p","marker":"108p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Inner Canon\" states: Cold infiltrates within; it is treated with sweet warmth, complemented by bitter and pungent agents. When dampness dominates, it must be balanced with bitter heat, diluted with mildness, and dried with bitterness. Aconite and dried ginger are strongly warm and spicy, dispersing the internal cold, thus they are used as the primary ingredients. Pinellia and cardamom are spicy and warm, while white atractylodes and aged tangerine peel are bitter, sweet, and warm, helping to strengthen the spleen and dry dampness, hence they serve as the secondary ingredients. Fresh ginger is spicy and warm to disperse, while licorice is sweet and neutral to help with infiltration. Bitter orange, being slightly cool and bitter, helps relieve fullness, while Artemisia capillaris is slightly cool and bitter, and its light nature helps; paired with ginger and aconite, it can expel cold dampness from the skin and body, thus serving as an assistant. Take one or two doses; if symptoms reduce by half, continue for complete relief. Additionally, take it with the Regulate the Middle Decoction for several days until the energy stabilizes."},{"anchor":"trans-109p","marker":"109p","type":"translation","text":"Some may find it difficult to understand: Why is it thought that yellow indicates heat, and yet during the peak of summer, one uses heat-clearing medicine to treat it? I say: It is natural and must be this way. Cheng Wujǐ states: There are two types of yin syndromes: One arises from external cold pathogens injuring the yin channels, or from consuming cold food, thus harming the Taiyin channel. The second occurs when one initially contracts a yang syndrome, and then treats it with cold, which, if excessive, transforms yang into yin. Now, you have the condition of Mr. Xiang, caused by the summer heat; the consumption of cold food harms the spleen, and overindulgence in cold leads to a dominance of yin qi, with yang qi on the verge of collapse. Additionally, with the convergence of continual rain and cold humidity, it manifests as yellow. This correlates with what Zhongjing said about seeking it amid cold and damp. Li Sishun comments: To resolve it with excessive cold and coolness, or to purge it and chase out the intruder harms the host—this is precisely the case. The sages' principles should not be carelessly neglected! Some might say: The study of cleanliness has been around since ancient times."},{"anchor":"trans-110p","marker":"110p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Medical Treatise\" states: A woman aged sixty suffers from shivering and chills, indicating cold in the foot's solar channels; yawning and sneezing relate to the foot's lesser yang and gallbladder; lack of saliva in her mouth suggests deficiency in the foot's yang brightness; there is acute pain and fullness in the heart, with the hand's lesser yin affected by cold, and stagnation of blood in the foot's lesser yin. She feels hot but desires proximity to fire, showing heat on the skin while cold resides in the bones. There is cold and discomfort below the navel, indicating cold in the lower dantian; her whole body and eyes show yellow, a sign of cold dampness. I have confirmed this and know it to be cold. Frequent yellow, red, and dark urination denotes excessive cold dampness. When the illness causes her body to feel heavy like a mountain, she immediately lies on her bed; this indicates excess of yin dampness. The pulse at the right wrist shows a thin string at the gate of life and heartbeat; pressing reveals it is strong and string-like. A tense string signifies cold; if it is also delicate, it indicates northern cold waters; if mixed with a very slow pulse, this shows excess dampness leading to yellowish conditions. A strong and broad pulse indicates heart fire is constrained. Pressing the left wrist down to the bone and noting fullness in the hand indicates vitality in the kidneys (water). If all six pulses are empty, there is no yang present in the lower source. As for treatment, I first recommend light doses to dispel the cold dampness, while also reducing the strong pulse, using a formula combining licorice with poria cooked in water to serve cool. This addresses heat brought on by cold, using fictitious cold against the foot's solar channels' false heat and applies the spicy warm properties of ginger to disperse the bladder's true qi, thus saying true against true, false against false. If there is no improvement, I would then prescribe a decoction of atractylodes and aconite.

They can still eat and have normal bowel movements. Upon examining them, I found their pulse to be large and weak, their nose is blocked, and they appear restless. I said: It is not caused by damp heat clashing with residual food; this is cold dampness in the head. It cannot be treated with Yinchenhao and Wuling, as it is not suitable. Zhongjing states: In cases of dampness causing body pain, with fever, a yellowish face, shortness of breath, headaches, and nasal congestion, the pulse is large, and the person can still eat. There are no issues in the abdomen, indicating that the illness lies in the head; cold dampness attacking the nose causes the blockage. Medicines taken through the nose can alleviate it. Zhongjing does not provide a prescription, but this formula appears in the \"Wai Tai,\" which discusses treating the heat from seasonal epidemics. It likely harmonizes the cold dampness throughout the organs, penetrating deep into the marrow, and might cause jaundice; hence, the Guati powder is appropriate, which is this formula."},{"anchor":"trans-112p","marker":"112p","type":"translation","text":"A boat arrived with a patient suffering from a cold that had caused a yellowed nose and sore eyes, and their entire body and eyes appeared golden. The urine was red and frequent, while the bowel movements were normal. Some suggested using Yinchen and Wuling, but I said that was not the correct treatment. With normal bowel movements, it indicates the illness is not in the organs. Now, with pain in the eyes and nose, the issue lies within the pathways of the lungs. If Da Huang (rhubarb) is administered, it would certainly cause abdominal distension as a side effect. One could also use Guati San by first dissolving it in water, then placing it in the nose until the yellow fluid is completely cleared. Zhao Zongyan, after excessive purging, developed jaundice with a pulse that was deep, thin, slow, and weak. Gradually, different medicines were administered, reaching Yinchen and Fuzi Decoction, which produced great effects. For the gradual approach, it meant first administering Han's Yinchen and Fuling Decoction, then moving on to Yinchen and Chenpi Decoction, and finally to Yinchen and Fuzi Decoction. Later, Scholar Zhao followed this method step by step. Due to early purging, he experienced jaundice, with a weak and shallow pulse and a cold body. He gradually took medication until reaching Yinchen and Sini Decoction, which had great effects. A monk with a cold had not fully sweated out the illness and retained heat, causing his entire face and body to turn yellow and suffer from excessive heat, with a year passing without recovery. The doctor treated it as food poisoning, but that was not the correct approach, and the illness did not resolve. When asked about his diet, it had not decreased. Subsequently, this medicine was given. After five days, his condition improved by one third; after ten days, two thirds; and after twenty days, the illness was completely gone. The formula used was three parts of Yinchen and Zhi Zi, and four qian each of Qin Jiao and Sheng Ma, ground into a powder.

After ten days, by evening, his vision failed completely. I said: This is called \"sparrow's eye.\" It is due to excessive damp phlegm and excess liver fire. I instructed him to cook pig liver and mix it with Ming Sha into pills to take, and his vision returned to normal. He came to thank me. I said: Not yet. If you do not take the liver-regulating, spleen-nourishing, phlegm-dispelling medicine early, it will certainly turn into bloating. He did not believe me, but after half a month, his abdomen gradually became bloated and full, and he sought treatment again. I prescribed Wei Ling Decoction once more, doubling the herbs, adding Mu Tong and Mai Men Dong, and prepared a decoction to take with the gold-reducing pills. After a month, he was well. The \"Medical Case of Xue Ji\" states: The Grand Minister Li Pu Ting, a junior official from the Ministry of Personnel, was then suffering from jaundice and should have been treated with a light draining medicine. However, he hesitated due to his lack of heirs. I said: If you have this illness, you should use this medicine. I prescribed Yin Chen Wu Ling Powder with the addition of Qian, Lian, and Shan Zhi, and he recovered. In the year of Xin Mao, he had a son and took my hand, laughing, saying: A doctor's prescription is like a public case; if you avoid slanderous remarks, how could you enjoy your remaining years and entrust them to others? From then on, he treated me with even greater respect. The governor of Yingtian suffered from full-body yellowing, spoke wildly, and endured severe chest pain, which was problematic due to blood accumulation in the middle burner.
