<p><strong>Childhood Wind and Cold</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Febrile Disease</strong></p>
<p>It is said: Children who have not been exposed to frost and snow do not fall ill from febrile diseases. Adults may suffer from cold for a long time, but this is not the concern here. However, when the weather is out of season, children may still become ill. Sometimes, during epidemic years, children can show symptoms like rashes after childbirth. In treating seasonal illnesses, the methods are similar to those for adults, but the doses of medication should be smaller and cooler.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Formula for Children</strong> (Song dynasty, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Wind Cold with Variations in Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When a child has a cold and is overly sleepy with a warm breath and feels uneasy, use large blue ointment to disperse it. If they continuously drink cold water and have a good appetite, use a small dose of rhubarb pills. Other remedies should not be purgative. For cold hands and feet, which indicate spleen deficiency, use nourishing yellow powder to warm the spleen and stomach along with large blue ointment to dispel wind pathogens. If the child is experiencing diarrhea due to a cold and has a weak spleen, use nourishing yellow powder and large blue ointment; if not healed, administer regulating middle pills. For cases of diarrhea, give rhubarb pills, followed later by warming and calming pills. If there is abdominal bloating or wheezing due to a weak spleen, first disperse and then reinforce the spleen. If the cold affects the liver, it will cause convulsions and restlessness; if it affects the heart, there will be anxiety; if it affects the lungs, there will be wheezing and coughing; if it affects the spleen, it will lead to drowsiness; if it affects the kidneys, the child may be sensitive to light. Each condition should be treated based on the organ that is affected.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Wind injury leads to excessive sleeping and eating, causing drinking and vomiting, with yellow stools; this indicates deficiency heat in the stomach. First, use Baizhu Powder to generate fluids, then use Daqing Paste to disperse.</p>
<p>With wind injury causing foamy vomiting, blue-white diarrhea, a feeling of distress without thirst, belching, and visible eyes while asleep, first use Yihuang Powder, then Daqing Paste.</p>
<p>With wind injury being hot or cold, excessive sleeping with coarse breathing, yellow-white stools, undigested milk vomiting, and intermittent coughing, first use Daqing Paste, then take Yihuang Powder, but be cautious not to use purgatives!</p>
<p>If purgatives are wrongly used for wind injury, causing thirst and a desire for water, this means the stomach has lost fluids and is in deficiency heat. Use Baizhu Powder frequently, and the heat thirst will naturally cease.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Daqing Paste is a remedy for dispersing exterior pathogens and should only be used when external pathogens have invaded the lungs, but lung qi has not been depleted. Dahuang Pill is a remedy for unblocking and should be applied when phlegm and stagnation accumulate in the stomach, with stomach qi still relatively robust. Moreover, since previous symptoms indicate spleen and lung qi deficiency, with open pores susceptible to external pathogens, treatment must be tailored to the case, primarily focusing on strengthening the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If there are cold limbs and self-benefiting, along with abdominal bloating and coughing, this indicates deficiency of the spleen and lungs due to cold. Use Liu Junzi Decoction with added Mu Xiang, Sheng Ma, and Jie Geng. If there are also palpitations and excessive phlegm, with little appetite and concern, this signifies deficiency of the heart and spleen. Use Si Junzi Decoction with added Chuan Xiong, Gui, and Suan Zao Ren. If there is also fatigue in the limbs, coughing, and shortness of breath, indicating qi deficiency of the spleen and lungs, use Liu Junzi Decoction with Dang Gui and Jie Geng. If there is sensitivity to light, with a lot of white sclera, this suggests kidney qi deficiency. Use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan with added Wu Wei Zi and Lu Rong; if not effective, further use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Wu Wei Zi and Shan Yao to nourish the kidney source. If there is excessive sleep and the person exhibits milk-like symptoms, with vomiting water and diarrhea, and yellow stool, this indicates deficiency of spleen qi and sinking down. Use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to raise and supplement the original qi. If there is foamy diarrhea and the patient sleeps with open eyes, indicating spleen deficiency due to invasion by wood, use Liu Junzi Decoction with added Sheng Ma and Chai Hu to adjust and supplement the spleen qi.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When one experiences alternating chills and fever, heavy breathing, yellowish-white stools, vomiting undigested milk, and has spleen and lung qi deficiency together with pathogenic factors, first use Xingxing San, followed by Si Junzi Tang. If laxatives are mistakenly used and thirst arises, it indicates damage to the spleen and stomach qi; in this case, use Baizhu San or either Liu Junzi or Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish. Generally, if the aforementioned symptoms appear urgently but the vital energy is intact, first use the original formula or a mild, clearing external remedy; if the vital energy is insufficient, as mentioned earlier, strengthen the vital energy to dispel external pathogens. If due to prolonged illness or the use of depleting medications the condition does not improve or mutates further, simply nourishing the spleen and stomach will lead to self-recovery. For children with wind-cold causing fever, nasal congestion, or phlegm blockage leading to convulsions, this often results from the wet breath of the wet nurse affecting the child’s fontanelle. They should take Xingxing Gao or use three to five stalks of green onions, finely chopped and pounded, spread on a piece of paper an inch long, and applied warm to the fontanelle; the pathogen will then be resolved. After removing the onions, take a silk piece about an inch long, coat it with flour paste, and reapply to the fontanelle, permanently alleviating the risk of catching a cold.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Injuries of Cold and Shock</strong></p>
<p>In the case of children with cold injuries, initially, there will be a fever without sweating, and they may cry excessively, appearing startled as if affected by sudden fright. One should use methods to dissipate heat without allowing thirst to develop; if thirst arises, they desire to drink water continuously, which indicates the need for dissipation. Remedies such as Qianghuo Powder, Sanhuang Powder, Chaihu Powder, or Baolong Pill may be used; if there is restlessness, Bamboo Leaf Decoction can be applied. For very young children, they should take Xixing Powder, Mint Powder, or Hongmian Powder, which will induce sweating in the limbs and naturally improve their spirit and mood. For severe cold injuries, treatment should follow the methods of Zhongjing. </p>
<p>When there is cold injury accompanied by shock, the first step is to dissipate the heat. To resolve phlegm and stop the shock, Baolong Pill can be given to infants under a year old, along with Qianghuo Powder combined with Jingjie and Fangfeng, and Sanhuang Powder to help relieve phlegm heat. Next, Chaihu and Huangqin should be used to regulate the condition, ensuring a calming effect. Scallion White Decoction can be administered.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Children&#39;s Febrile Illness and Seasonal Differences</p>
<p>Children’s febrile illness, whether acquired or experienced by adults, is fundamentally the same; the only difference in treatment is that children may also be startled. It can also arise from being startled while eating. The treatment method is similar to that for adults, but the dosage is smaller, resulting in a milder effect of the medicine. Zhang Zhongjing stated: in spring, the air is warm and gentle; in summer, it is hot and intense; in autumn, it is cool and refreshing; in winter, it is cold and bitter. This is the proper sequence of the four seasonal energies. When winter is harshly cold, those who encounter it are said to suffer from febrile illness. Any adverse effects of the seasonal energies can lead to illness. If one is afflicted by cold toxins in winter, the immediate symptoms include headache, body aches, fever, and chills, termed febrile illness. If symptoms do not appear immediately, the cold toxins may remain hidden in the skin, and as the yang energy rises in spring and summer, these toxins conflict with the yang in the body&#39;s protective system, producing a condition similar to the immediate illness experienced in winter, but due to its emergence in spring, it is termed a warm disease, and if it occurs in summer, it is termed a hot disease. When the yang heat is not yet abundant and is restricted by cold, it is called a warm illness; when the yang heat is abundant and cold cannot restrict it, it is called a hot illness. Therefore, the great physicians refer to it as febrile illness. However, hot diseases, febrile illnesses, and warm diseases are all variations of seasonal ailments that can change and intermingle. Seasonal ailments arise from improper experiences of the seasonal energies. For instance, if spring should be warm but is cold instead, summer should be hot but is cold, autumn should be cool but is hot, and winter should be cold but is warm, it is improper for the season to present such energies.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>In the case of illnesses caused by seasonal influences, symptoms can include headaches, fever, cough, rough breathing, irritability and thirst, a restless heart, confusion, and anxiety, resembling conditions like typhoid. Therefore, throughout the year, one may experience various ailments, which often appear similar; this is known as the seasonal wind or what people refer to as &quot;heavenly influences.&quot; </p>
<p>Treatment methods: In March and April, if there is a sudden cold, the yang energy is still weak and can be affected by the cold, leading to milder heat symptoms. In such cases, the Shegan Decoction or Sang Ju San is prescribed. In May and June, as the yang energy increases, if affected by cold, the heat symptoms can become severe; in July and August, as the yang energy declines, the cold can again have a lesser effect. The Tiaozhong Decoction, Shegan Decoction, and Banxia Guizhi Decoction can be selected for use. </p>
<p>In autumn and winter, treatment for dampness is aimed at promoting urination. For winter heat, it is also advisable to relieve and promote urination. For promoting urination, the Wuling San can be used; for relieving winter heat, the Weirui Decoction is appropriate. Winter heat arises from the influence of warm energies. Cold epidemics cause sudden cold effects on people; this is not due to exposure but is treated differently, and the herbs for cold and heat are also different. One should not rigidly adhere to a fixed timeframe for treatment but should adjust sweating, vomiting, or purging according to symptoms. </p>
<p>In summary, to treat heat, use cold methods; to treat warmth, use clearing methods; to treat cold, apply heating methods; to treat clarity, use warm methods. Aim for balance and avoid excess, which is the fundamental principle. The Tang family has the Seven Treasures Powder, which can be adjusted and taken, especially beneficial for nursing mothers. For those with heat symptoms, adding Chai Hu and Huang Qin to the Shegan Decoction is effective, and the Chai Hu Shigao Decoction is particularly potent.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>In treating pediatric typhoid fever, it is essential to distinguish between exterior and interior conditions. Without this distinction, sweating or purging may be misguided. Ancient sages said: &quot;With Gui Zhi, if the Yang is excessive, it leads to death; with Cheng Qi, if the Yin is excessive, it leads to disaster.&quot; Typhoid has both exterior symptoms and interior symptoms; some may present as half exterior and half interior, while others may show both conditions at once. </p>
<p>For those with exterior symptoms, sweating is advisable; for those with interior symptoms, purging is appropriate. In cases of mixed symptoms, harmonizing treatment is necessary. If there are no distinct exterior or interior symptoms, administer Da Chai Hu Decoction. </p>
<p>Exterior symptoms include fever, chills, body aches, a floating pulse, lack of sweating, headache, stiffness of the neck, and back pain; these indicate illness of the Tai Yang Bladder channel and should be treated with sweating. However, the method of sweating for exterior symptoms should depend on the severity of the illness. For headaches and fever accompanied by agitation, it may suffice to use Scallion White Decoction for sweating; for more severe cases, options include Ma Huang Decoction, Ge Gen Decoction, Xiao Feng San, and others, which can all be selected for use.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>In cases of interior syndrome, there is a dislike for heat but not for cold, with profuse sweating from the palms and armpits, dryness in the stomach, a dry throat, constipated stools, tidal fever, hard stools, normal urination, a full abdomen with shortness of breath, restlessness and thirst, a deep and slippery pulse, and internal heat causing delirium; this indicates a pattern of the Stomach meridian of the Foot Yangming and should be treated with purgatives such as Xiao Chengqi Decoction, Da Chengqi Decoction, Si Shun Drink, and Xixin Powder, used according to the severity. </p>
<p>In cases that are both half-exterior and half-interior, where there is fullness beneath the heart, lack of appetite, hard stools, and a deep, thin pulse, this is an interior syndrome and should be purged; if the person has sweating on the head, a slight aversion to cold, and cold hands and feet, then sweating should be induced. When both of these syndromes are present, as mentioned by Zhongjing, this is called half in the exterior, half in the interior, and should be treated with Xiao Chaihu Decoction.</p>
<p>In cases of Taiyang disease not resolving and transitioning into Shaoyang, with hardness and fullness beneath the ribs, dry retching unable to accept food and drink, and alternating chills and fever, if the pulse is taut and tight, then Xiao Chaihu Decoction is indicated, as this pertains to the Shaoyang Gallbladder meridian, and harmonization is necessary. </p>
<p>If both exterior and interior symptoms are present, and the patient has a floating and large pulse, this indicates an exterior syndrome, and sweating should be applied; if the person has fever, thirst, and red urination, this indicates an interior syndrome, and purgation is necessary. Thus, in cases where both exterior and interior symptoms appear together, Wu Ling San is the appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a person with a fever has not defecated for six or seven days and has a headache with heat, this indicates an interior syndrome that should be purged; if the person’s urination is clear, it shows that the condition is still in the exterior, and sweating must be induced.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>This indicates that both symptoms are present; therefore, it is not appropriate to purge. It is advisable to use Gui Zhi Decoction. Furthermore, in cases of Taiyang disease, if the physician purges, and there is also abdominal pain, this indicates an exterior condition combined with an interior condition. Zhang Zhongjing employed Gui Zhi Decoction with Shao Yao. If the pain is severe, Gui Zhi Decoction with Da Huang is used; or if the pain occurs when the abdomen is distended and both pulse readings are floating and surging, this corresponds to the Foot Taiyin Spleen Meridian. If there is free bowel movement and no thirst, it should be warmed with Si Ni Decoction or Li Zhong Decoction. If there are no exterior or interior symptoms after four or five days of febrile disease and the case has exceeded the time without exterior or interior symptoms, and if there are still interior symptoms that should not be purged, these cases are neither purging nor sweating conditions, and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can be used, adjusting according to symptoms. If after ten days of using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction there is no improvement, if the stools are hard and purging is deemed necessary, then Da Chai Hu Decoction should be used to purge them. Zhang Zhongjing states that if after six or seven days the eyes are unclear, the vision is not harmonious, and there are no exterior or interior symptoms, with difficult stool and slight feverishness of the body, this signifies a solid condition, and it should be purged using Da Cheng Qi Decoction. If there is no thirst, the mouth is not dry, but the tongue is dry and the pulse is deep, urgent warming is required, suggesting Si Ni Decoction is appropriate. This pertains to the Foot Shaoyin Kidney Meridian.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>If the surface is hot and the interior is cold, the body feels very hot and desires clothing; the heat is on the skin and the cold in the bone marrow. One should first administer Yindan Decoction; after alleviating this, follow with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added cinnamon to warm the surface. If the body feels very cold and desires no clothing, the cold is on the skin and the heat in the bone marrow. One should first administer Bai Hu Decoction with added ginseng; after eliminating the heat, follow with a decoction of equal parts cinnamon twig and ephedra to ease the exterior.</p>
<p>For the condition of Jueyin, where the pulse is floating and weak, the bag must not contract, and the exterior symptoms must feature fever and chills resembling malaria, indicating a desire for recovery. Therefore, one should use a decoction of equal parts cinnamon twig and ephedra. If the pulse at both positions is deep and short, the bag must contract, indicating that toxic qi has entered the organs; one should use Chengqi Decoction to purge it.</p>
<p>In Jueyin disease, if the pulse is slightly floating this indicates a desire for recovery; if not floating, recovery is not yet achieved. In this case, Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction should be used, as this pertains to the Jueyin liver channel. However, exterior and interior conditions may resemble the three Yin and three Yang syndromes, and should not be hastily categorized under the six major patterns of disease. Therefore, one should refer primarily to the &quot;Book of Living Persons&quot; and &quot;Discussion on Cold Damage.&quot;</p>
<p>The malaria signs follow the same treatment as in major treatises, with further details in this section. Summer heat-related issues will certainly lead to chills and fevers in the autumn. Treatments for heat conditions are primarily based on Yulu Powder, and the specifics of its healing method are similar to those in major treatises, albeit using lighter dosages. &quot;Oral Discussions&quot; mention Tie Jia San, which is very effective in dispelling heat, supporting the surface, and rescuing the interior; truly a fine remedy!<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Cold-induced Cough and Wind</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: In cases of cough, the lungs are slightly affected by cold. In the months of August and September, the lung qi is vigorous; those who suffer from cough in this period must have a substantial illness, not due to a long-standing condition. The symptoms include a flushed face, body heat, and abundant phlegm, which should be treated with Ting Li Wan. However, if the cough has persisted for a long time, it should not be purged.</p>
<p>In winter, cough is due to a wind cold, which should be treated with Ma Huang Tang to induce sweating. If there is a red face, drinking water, and thick phlegm with an obstructed throat, Gan Ju Tang should be used. In cases where lung qi is high leading to coughing and then wheezing, with facial swelling and a desire to drink water, but the person refrains, their body is definitely hot, and Bai Shao San should be used to purge it. If there is coughing with expectoration of phlegm, and a diet of milk or dairy, then Bai Bing Zi should be administered.</p>
<p>The lungs govern qi and are related to the skin and hair; they are the protective cover of the five zang organs. Young children affected by wind and cold, as it gets to their skin, can harm the lung channels, causing mild coughing or severe wheezing. If the lungs are injured by cold, there will be a cough with abundant phlegm, and a rapid sound in the throat. If injured by warmth, then the cough will be congested and obstructed. </p>
<p>Cold-induced injuries require expelling the cold pathogens, while warmth-induced injuries require draining the obstruction. To disperse cold, use sweet and pungent herbs like Gui Zhi, Ma Huang, and Xi Xin; for draining, use sour and bitter herbs like Ting Li and Da Huang. Additionally, the sourness of Wu Mei and Wu Wei Zi can help restrain lung qi and are vital medicines for treating cough. If a cough persists, it will definitely lead to a sensation of fright, stubborn phlegm, and blood vessels bursting in the face.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Coughing affects the five internal organs; it may result in reverse flow, phlegm and drool, coldness, or palpitations. In severe cases, the area around the eyes can become purple and black as if injured, with the whites of the eyes appearing red like blood. This is referred to as &quot;blood eyes.&quot; The method of treatment involves using raw Rehmannia and moist black beans ground into a paste and applied over the eyes. The swelling and darkness will reduce, and blood will flow out as tears, truly an excellent remedy. Additionally, taking wheat decoction powder will help stop the cough.</p>
<p>If the cough has persisted for a long time and has become a chronic condition, one should take powder to treat the syndrome. Generally, in treating a cough, one must first dispel the cold pathogen, then take medicine to relieve phlegm and stop the cough to achieve recovery. One should first take Nine Treasure Pills, Huagai Powder, Tingli Pills, or Baolong Pills; or a decoction of Chuanxiong and Schisandra. If there is heat, cooling herbs for the lung such as Chaihu and Huangqin can be employed, along with Baihua Powder; if there is abundant phlegm and shortness of breath, use Jinxing Pills. When phlegm is cleared, return to the previous remedies, then take Baibu Pills, Shengxi Powder, and Tianma Decoction to regulate and stabilize.</p>
<p>For cough due to cold, Xiao Qinglong Decoction plus apricot kernels, excluding ephedra, is also appropriate. For cough due to heat and timely Qi, Chaihu Powder with apricot kernels and Schisandra or Chaihu Shigao Decoction may also be good. Modified Qian&#39;s Shengxi Powder works well too. For cough due to fright, Tianma Fangfeng Pills are effective. Both Xingxing Powder and Huafeng Dan are applicable. Jinfencao Powder and San&#39;ao Decoction, with adjustments, are common remedies for cough from a cold. Hejie Decoction can be taken for colds at any time of the year, with adjustments as necessary.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Ming Medical Miscellany</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Wang Lun</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Wind Injury and Runny Nose</strong></p>
<p>For children under eight years old, without signs of a cold, even if they have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, fever, and cough due to a cold, the focus should be on reducing phlegm, with slight relief. Remedies that disperse and eliminate pathogens are not suitable for the young. For mild colds, there is no need for medication, as many tend to recover on their own within two or three days. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there are signs such as cold hands and feet or abdominal distension, which indicate spleen deficiency, use &quot;Six Gentleman Decoction&quot; with the addition of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu; if there is abdominal distension or shortness of breath indicating lung deficiency, use &quot;Four Gentleman Decoction&quot; with Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. The classics state: &quot;The lungs govern Qi and control the skin and hair. If the lungs are deficient, the pores are not tight, making it easy to be affected by external pathogens.&quot; After dispersing the exterior, once the pathogen is eliminated, it is important to tonify the spleen and lungs to consolidate the exterior, preventing the wind pathogen from re-entering; often, after dispersing the exterior, if heat cough persists, repeating exterior dispersal can lead to complications.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical System</strong><br><strong>Ming - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>

<p>Febrile diseases in children are no different from those in adults; the distinction lies primarily in their susceptibility to improper feeding. Sometimes, they may suffer from external influences known as seasonal afflictions, which are different from mere febrile illnesses. If an infant is weak or has a frail constitution, it is often due to the wet nurse neglecting to keep them warm and exposing them to cold winds. However, children cannot articulate the reasons for their ailments, nor can their pulses reveal clear diagnoses; they only show signs of irritability and fever, which necessitates careful attention.  </p>
<p>At the onset of illness, for infants, the redness of the pulse at the tiger&#39;s mouth and the three positions can be examined. For older children, one should press one finger on the three levels and determine the condition by assessing the tightness and fullness of the pulse in the left hand. Symptoms include wheezing, fear of cold, heat in the chest, yawning, irritability, and stiffness of the neck. If they show aversion to cold winds and seek warmth, huddling close to others and keeping their bodies covered, these are considered exterior symptoms.  </p>
<p>If they have internal heat, they will seek to expose their heads and limbs, showing restlessness, thirst, dryness in stools, and a tendency to throw off their coverings. This indicates interior symptoms. On the other hand, if there is cold sweat on the forehead, coolness in the hands and feet, a cold mouth, dark and pale complexion, and dark diarrhea, this is indicative of a yin condition. Observing the urine, whether red or white, can indicate the presence of internal heat; if it is dark or turbid, this reveals the severity of the internal condition.  </p>
<p>From these observations, one may deduce the appropriate method of inducing sweating and using warm remedies.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong></p>

The text mentions: Four Gentlemen Decoction.</p>
<p>In autumn, the governing element is metal; the body is cool and internally warm, which should be slightly lowered. The text mentions: Tonggewan and Jinhua Wan.</p>
<p>In winter, the governing element is water; the body is warm but dislikes cold, indicating heat on the outside and cold on the inside; if the body is cold and dislikes heat, then it suggests heat on the inside and cold on the outside. The text mentions: For heat inside, use the Adjusting Stomach and Chengqi Decoction; for cold inside, use the Adjusting Middle Decoction Pills. If there are exterior symptoms of aversion to wind and cold, one should induce sweating.</p>
<p>In general, for cold damage, one should base treatment on the four seasons of yin and yang, the ascending and descending, and the opposites of rigid and soft. If qi is rising and floating, it should be treated by allowing it to release; if it is stored, it should be lowered. If there is sweating with fever and aversion to wind, along with a deep and slow pulse, this indicates wind injury to the defensive qi, for which one should use Gui Zhi Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is no sweating, with fever and aversion to cold, not being aversive to wind but instead hating cold, and with a floating and tight pulse, this indicates cold injury to the nutritive qi, for which one should use Ma Huang Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is sweating, with fever and aversion to wind, and a floating and tight pulse; or if there is no sweating, with fever and aversion to cold, and a floating and slow pulse, this indicates both the nutritive and defensive qi are injured, so one can use a combination of Qinglong and Gui Zhi Ma Huang Decoction in equal parts. </p>
<p>If there is no sweating and fever, not aversive to wind or cold, and a deep and surging pulse, this can be treated with purgation. The treatment should be more carefully adjusted based on the severity of the cold or heat. </p>
<p>If there is sweating with cold limbs and a deep and weak pulse, this is called yin collapse, for which one would use Si Ni Decoction. If there is no sweating, with cold limbs and a deep and weak pulse, this is called yang collapse, for which one would use the Great Purgative Decoction with the addition of nèi fěn (sticky powder).<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If the limbs are not cool, and the body is hot both internally and externally, without affecting the three yang organs, it is appropriate to take cooling medicine in doses of three to five. Suitable prescriptions include Huangqin and Gancao Decoction, Huangqin and Baizhu Decoction, Huangqin and Cangzhu Decoction, Huangqin and Ziziphus Decoction, Lianqiao Yinzi, Xiaochaihu Decoction, Bazheng San, Lianggexi San, Baihu Decoction, and Wuhuang San—these are medicines suitable for the upper, middle, and lower jiao. </p>
<p>For heatstroke with a weak pulse, where there is coldness in the back, spontaneous sweating, and thirst, Baihu Decoction is indicated. </p>
<p>If the body feels cool and the pulse is tight, indicating internal heat, it should be urgently purged. If there is dry mouth and throat without bowel movement, it means. </p>
<p>If there is no sweat but great heat in the body, one may induce sweating with Shengma Decoction, Daqing Gao, or Tianma Gao. </p>
<p>If there is sweating with great heat in the body, suitable options include Guizhi Decoction, Xingseng San, Jiemai Decoction, Xiaochaihu Decoction, and Baizhu and Fangfeng Decoction. </p>
<p>For those inducing sweat, it is important to consider the seasonal variations of heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and cold, with appropriate treatments for spring coolness, summer cold, autumn warmth, and winter heat.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Pediatric Hygiene - On Febrile Illness</strong></p>
<p>The classic text states: There are five types of febrile illnesses: stroke, heat diseases, warm diseases, dampness diseases, and cold diseases, each causing different suffering. These five align with the five energies and correspond to the four seasons for diseases. Thus, spring corresponds to wind, summer to heat, autumn to dampness, winter to cold, and the central season to warmth, with cold residing in one category. Detailed discussions can be found in the classifications of febrile illnesses. The diseases of the four seasons, all referred to as cold illnesses, are general terms. </p>
<p>Internal heat diseases occur during the height of summer, caused by exposure to hot and humid air, also known as &quot;heatstroke.&quot; Damp diseases arise from exposure to rain, dew, frost, mist, smoke, and moisture. Young children are not subject to these two forms of illness because they do not engage in household chores, do not become fatigued, and tend to go to bed early and rise late, avoiding excessive exposure. </p>
<p>Young children can suffer from three illnesses: wind, cold, and warm diseases due to severe cold, strong winds, and pervasive warm air. Children&#39;s muscles are delicate, and their qi and blood are weak, making them easily injured. For these three diseases, diagnosis through pulse examination is not viable; slightly older children can have their pulses checked for diagnosis.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The pulse in a case of wind injury is floating in the yang and weak in the yin; the pulse in a case of cold injury has both yin and yang flourishing but is tight and thick; the pulse in a case of warm disease moves through various meridians, and it is unknown which meridian is affected, so the pulse is taken according to where it is located. If a child is too young to be diagnosed through pulse taking, one should observe their physical condition.</p>
<p>Wind injury refers to the harmful winds of all seasons and directions that affect people, presenting symptoms of drowsiness, yawning, irritability, hot breath, occasional sweating with aversion to wind, fever, nasal congestion with dry retching, more heat than cold, a radiant but not pale face, and heat in the hands and feet, alongside restlessness. The treatment should be dispersive. Some can drink water and eat, while others cannot eat. Those who can drink and eat may be treated with gentle purging; the rest should not be purged.</p>
<p>Cold injury, on the other hand, is caused by the severe cold air of winter that harms individuals by penetrating the skin. At that time, robust individuals merely experience qi movement, while the weak develop illness. The immediate onset of this condition is termed cold injury. If it occurs in spring, it is termed warm disease. One might also say that if it occurs before the summer solstice, it is not a seasonal warm disease. If it occurs in summer, it is classified as a heat disease; if after the summer solstice, it is not due to heatstroke.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>When the patient’s face is red, the body feels hot, there is headache and body ache, nasal congestion with a heavy voice, clear nasal discharge and cough, hairs standing on end, shortness of breath, possible vomiting of white fluid, predominance of cold over heat, pale and uncomfortable complexion, fingers and toes slightly cold, not irritable yet feeling cold. </p>
<p>Those with wind-cold do not dislike cold but dislike wind; those with cold-illness do not dislike wind but dislike cold. The one who dislikes wind feels cold when exposed to it; the one who dislikes cold may also feel cold even without exposure to wind. This distinguishes between the two.</p>
<p>For treatment: If the pulse is vigorous and strong, body feels hot, headache and face are red, and the limbs are warm, it indicates a yang condition; sweating is advisable. If the pulse is weak and thin, body feels cold, there is not much headache, body aches, face is pale, and the limbs are cold, it indicates a yin condition; warming is advisable.</p>
<p>In cases of warm-illness, if one suffers from unseasonable pathogens, such as feeling cold in spring when it should be warm, or feeling cool in summer when it should be hot, or feeling hot in autumn when it should be cool, or feeling warm in winter when it should be cold, it indicates that these conditions are due to pathogenic qi prevailing at that time. Therefore, this illness has no significant variations, hence termed seasonal pathogenic warm-illness, also known as timely warm-illness.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>When the patient presents with a headache, heaviness in the body, strong fever, and body aches, it resembles typhoid fever. However, by observing the pulse and symptoms, one must determine which meridian is affected by the illness and treat according to that meridian. The three conditions mentioned above are all treated as if they were typhoid fever. If the pathogen is external, it should be released through sweating; if it is internal, it should be warmed and purged. Treatment should be carried out according to the symptoms and established methods. Qian Yi mentioned that for men suffering from typhoid, the body is heavy and the face is yellow; for women, there is rapid breathing and a red face, both despising cold, with hot breath in the mouth, frequent yawning, and feelings of restlessness. This description does not differentiate between cold and typhoid but addresses them generally. Furthermore, cold and typhoid have multiple variations in symptoms, and there are established methods for each specific condition. Master Sun stated that the treatment for children and adults is no different, except that the quantity of medicinal decoctions should be reduced significantly. There are also cases of cold combined with food intake, commonly referred to as &quot;combined food and typhoid.&quot; The symptoms include strong fever, thirst, nasal congestion, heavy voice, fatigue in the limbs, yellowing of the eyes, abdominal distension and pain, salivation, vomiting, or yawning and restlessness. In treatment, one should not first attack the site of injury but rather release the exterior. Once the exterior is resolved, one can then address the internal issues, and both the illness and the food problems will subside; if one disregards the exterior and directly attacks with medicine, it can lead to stagnation and pain.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>When one suffers from hunger and consumes cold food and drinks, it harms the spleen and stomach, leading to a cold invasion. The signs include discomfort in the chest, abdominal distension and pain, a pale complexion with bluish lips, cold extremities, and a deep, fine pulse. This indicates cold injury to the spleen, belonging to the Taiyin category. Inexperienced practitioners misdiagnose this as simple discomfort in the chest and rashly resort to acupuncture or laxatives, which only worsen the discomfort leading to vomiting and diarrhea. Within just a couple of days, this can result in a critical condition, which reflects a lack of understanding in treatment. </p>
<p>There are many medicinal signs in the classic texts for cold injury, which are difficult to fully describe. Here, I will summarize common cases seen in children and those with overlapping symptoms. For those experiencing cold-induced symptoms like cold hands and feet, fever, reddened face, and headache—this indicates a weak spleen, and one should first harmonize the spleen before dispersing the cold. For those with cold-induced diarrhea, this indicates spleen deficiency, and one should first tonify the spleen before dispersing the cold. If the illness is not yet resolved, one must first regulate the internal condition. If there are signs of diarrhea, one may use mild purging; if there&#39;s shock, one should calm it. </p>
<p>For cold-induced abdominal distension accompanied by wheezing, this indicates spleen deficiency, and one should first strengthen the spleen to relieve distension and stabilize breathing. Once the breathing is stable, then one may disperse the cold.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>When one suffers from a cold and experiences heat following the cold, if the intense heat has receded but residual heat remains, it indicates excessive treatment of the cold, resulting in a deficiency of the stomach that allows heat to take hold. If there is deficient heat in the stomach, even if it is not much, it is important to generate fluid in the stomach; when fluids are produced, the heat will subside naturally.</p>
<p>When one is attacked by cold and the heat manifests outwardly, it is classified as an exterior condition. If the heat has not penetrated inward, both conditions must be resolved accordingly. If there is internal deficiency and reversed qi, resulting in heat accumulating and hardening in the chest causing pain, this is known as chest constriction; if there is only fullness and hardness without pain, it is known as phlegm qi; if the condition arises after drinking water, it is termed water accumulation. </p>
<p>If the external heat has penetrated inward for three to four days, it can cause abdominal fullness and phlegm if there are dry stools; in such cases, one must induce a bowel movement. If the heat enters the large intestine, it results in constipation with hard stools; if it enters the small intestine, it leads to difficulty in urination; if heat infiltrates both large and small intestines, it results in complete obstruction of both urination and defecation. </p>
<p>When heat enters the spleen and stomach, which are associated with the earth element and are reflected in the muscles, excess heat may manifest externally as jaundice. If the heat consumes the heart and chest area, it may lead to restlessness; if the bodily fluids are depleted, it results in thirst, and if the heat rushes upward affecting the throat and tongue, it causes sores, swelling, and pain. </p>
<p>In cases of blood loss, if blood is heated, it may overflow uncontrollably: if it flows from the nose, it is called nosebleed; if it comes from the mouth, it is termed hematemesis; if it appears in the stool, it is bloody diarrhea; and if it is found in the urine, it is referred to as hematuria.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>If the strong heat has not yet caused sweating, accompanied by restlessness, panting, and nasal wheezing, but there is a rise in blood pressure and the heat subsides, then the illness is resolved; however, if the discharge reaches two or three liters, it is dangerous. If the heat toxin is full within and does not descend in time, leading to toxins overwhelming stagnant blood, then severe agitation and mania will arise. If there is a combination of heat and cold causing confusion and heaviness, it can lead to death. If there is cold in the stomach causing disturbance, it will result in vomiting, belching, and rebellious qi; if there is cold in the lungs, it will lead to coughing and shortness of breath; if the qi is weak and transforms into yin, it will result in cold limbs, a pale face, body coldness, and clear diarrhea. Treatment should be based on the symptoms presented. </p>
<p>Qian Yi discusses colds and fevers, rashes, and eating disorders, which all share similarities. If one cannot discern between them in a rush, administering Shengma Gancao Decoction, Xingsheng Powder, or Xiaochaihu Decoction—a few medicines serve as effective general treatments.</p>
<p>The &quot;Shenghui&quot; also states that in cases of infantile fevers, one must not use excessively drying medicines to induce sweating, as drying can injure the organs. Extreme heat can harm the heart, making reversal difficult. Furthermore, one should not use hot medicines, as heat supports yang; when yang is extreme, yin contends, resulting in profuse sweating like oil from the limbs, which may be alternately cold or hot, often leading to agitation, seizures, and convulsions, making them difficult to treat.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>One must also avoid using cold remedies, for if the cold affects the yang, the clash of cold and heat will lead to continuous crying and sleeplessness. If heat rises to the head, it can cause the skull sutures to open, making it difficult to treat. I found myself in Qiantang, staying at the home of a relative, Su Bozheng, a well-known practitioner of medicine for treating typhoid fever. I often observed his method of prescribing medication. When a child suffers from typhoid fever with strong heat, symptoms like headache, body aches, a strong pulse, nasal congestion, heavy voice, sneezing, coughing, yawning, aversion to wind, and dislike of cold, and the disease is on the surface leading to sweating, he would use Silver White Powder; if there&#39;s excessive heat, Sweet Dew Powder; for issues with food stagnation, where the stomach and spleen are not in harmony, he would use An Wei Pills intermittently; for chest discomfort, he would use Fragrant Shell Powder intermittently; for thirst and the urge to drink, or when alternating between cold and heat, he would use Ling Sha Powder intermittently; if there is fright, he would use Tianma Fangfeng Pills or Ginseng Wind Resolving Ointment; for excessive saliva and coughing, he would use Small Pearl Pills. With this treatment approach, the recovery rate is quite high, about eighty to ninety percent. Only one or two cases are ones where the illness has persisted deeply or has developed into a more severe condition. When called for treatment, if he follows the prescribed methods, recovery can be achieved. Most of the medicines he uses are not from ancient formulas, and they are not excessively warming. Generally, they are mild and balanced, demonstrating a keen understanding of the differences between cold and heat in various regions, as well as a profound comprehension of the ancient principles of disease treatment.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Essentials for Treating Childhood Illnesses</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Dong Fengchong</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Febrile Illnesses</strong>  </p>
<p>In treating febrile illnesses, one must differentiate between exterior and interior conditions. Failure to make this distinction can lead to mistakes in sweating or purging. When the exterior condition is present, sweating is indicated; when the interior condition is present, purging is indicated. Attacking the interior when the exterior condition is present is not an effective method. The exterior conditions belong to Yang and affect the six bowels, while the interior conditions belong to Yin and affect the five organs. When Yang is excessive and Yin is deficient, sweating will lead to death, while purging should lead to recovery. Conversely, when Yang is deficient and Yin is excessive, purging will lead to death, while sweating should lead to recovery.<br>When Yang is deficient with external cold and Yin is deficient with internal heat, or when Yang is excessive with external heat and Yin is excessive with internal cold, inappropriate sweating will result in fluid overflow and exhaustion. Failure to sweat or excessive sweating will lead to obstruction of the openings and stagnation. Inappropriate purging or excessive purging will cause uncontrolled diarrhea. Failure to purge will lead to swelling and discomfort. Violating any of these principles may result in fatality.  </p>

Take 2 to 3 qian each time, decoct in ginger water. Xue Ji states: If the wind pathogen recedes but phlegm heat persists, strengthening the middle qi will transform phlegm and achieve recovery.

Grind into powder. Take one to two qian (a unit of weight), decoct with ginger and mint water. Xue Ji said: According to the &quot;Secret Instructions,&quot; even if a child has a cold with symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, fever, and cough, the main focus is to reduce phlegm with slight relief from the symptoms. Generally, dispersing toxins is not suitable for young children. If symptoms are mild, it may not be necessary to use medicine; wait one to two days for self-recovery. I suggest that if symptoms include cold hands and feet or abdominal distension, indicating spleen deficiency, use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction) with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma; if there is abdominal distension or weak breathing, indicating lung deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction) with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. Indeed, if the lungs are deficient, the defensive qi is weak and external pathogens can easily enter. After expelling pathogens, the internal organs should be nourished to strengthen the surface, ensuring no changes in the condition.</p>

When the yang is floating and heat arises, the weak yin leads to spontaneous sweating, aversion to cold, and intermittent feverish sensations, along with nasal congestion and dry retching. </p>
<p>The ingredients include: </p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 taels of cinnamon twig (桂枝) without the bark</li>
<li>1.5 taels of fresh ginger (生姜)</li>
<li>1.5 taels of peony root (芍药)</li>
<li>1 tael of honey-fried licorice root (炙草)</li>
<li>6 dates (枣子)</li>
</ul>
<p>This mixture is prepared into a decoction. Each dose is 3 qian, with a cup of water, boiled down to around 80%, then filtered. Adjust the dosage as needed. After taking the decoction, it is advised to consume a bowl of warm congee to enhance the medicinal effects, covering oneself well for about an hour. If there is a slight overall warmth and mild sweating, then the Guizhi Decoction may be further adjusted. </p>
<p>For those residing in the northwest and in all seasons, this remedy will certainly prove effective. In the Jianghuai region, it should only be used in winter and spring. From late spring to just before summer solstice, when there are symptoms of Guizhi, you may add one part of Huangqin, calling it Yindan Decoction. After the summer solstice, if there are Guizhi symptoms, half a tael of Zhimu and one tael of gypsum, or one part of Shengma may be added. </p>
<p>However, if the patient has long-standing deficiency and cold conditions, only the original formula should be used without adjustments. </p>
<p>A caution: Guizhi is the most difficult herb to use. Although it is said to resolve external conditions, it can induce sweating. The suitable case for Guizhi Decoction requires that the patient typically has spontaneous sweating, urination is infrequent, hands and feet are warm, perhaps with slight cold in hands and toes, and mildly bothersome body heat with aversion to cold. In such cases, it can be used. If the patient has no sweating, more frequent urination, cold hands and feet without aversion to cold, or if the individual dislikes sweet due to alcohol consumption, Guizhi should not be used. Moreover, if the symptoms of Guizhi have been present and the decoction was taken without resolution of those symptoms, it should not be administered again.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Peony is used to treat Taiyang disease; if there is a reversal and resulting abdominal pain, it indicates both exterior and interior conditions, and it should be administered. </p>

<li><p>For a child with a cold, suffering from high fever for a hundred days: Burn one jin of iron tridents until red, add two dou of water; quench it seven times, then boil down to half and add seven pieces of willow leaves for bathing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a child with wind-cold: Grind one qian of radish seeds into a fine powder and take it with warm scallion wine to induce slight sweating with great effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To treat colds with strong symptoms and unbearable headaches: Grind (stone salt) into a fine powder and mix with oil to apply to the top of the head.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>To treat the pain in the hands and feet caused by febrile illness: use goat-peach juice mixed with salt and fermented soy sauce to soak.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To treat febrile illness causing hardness and pain in the epigastric region due to water retention, known as &quot;water knot&quot;: mix garden balsam flower with vinegar, stir-fry over low heat until cooked, wrap in cotton to apply, and change when it cools. Stir-fry again and use as needed.</p>
<p>To treat febrile illness with heat toxin affecting the heart, leading to confusion and restlessness: use indigo dye, one character or half a coin&#39;s worth, mixed with fresh water.</p>
<p>To treat febrile illness with Yin syndrome showing reverse cold, use half a sheng of evodia fruit, mixed with wine, and steam in two silk bags until very hot, applying to the soles of the feet. Change when it cools. Wait until the breath is smooth and warm, then stop.</p>
<p>To treat febrile illness with lingering heat after sweating, causing restlessness, thirst, and weakness in the limbs, resulting in inability to eat: pound burdock root into a mash, extract the juice, and administer based on size and quantity.</p>
<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>In Wan&#39;s &quot;Developments in Pediatric Studies,&quot; it is stated: A child of small stature caught a wind pathogen, took an exterior dispersant and began to sweat and wheeze; once the pathogen was expelled, the spleen and lungs became weak. The treatment with Yigong Powder halted the sweating and wheezing. After another dosage, the child resumed eating.</p>
<p>In Xue Kai&#39;s &quot;Essentials for Infant Care,&quot; it is mentioned: A nine-year-old child, who has always been sensitive to wind and cold with little appetite, experiences cold air entering the mouth and nose in autumn and winter, leading to chilly sensations in the abdomen and ice-cold hands and feet. Drinking ginger soup and strong liquor provided relief, but the pulse was thin and weak, and the two wrists felt almost absent. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of the fire of the Mingmen. Using Huanshaodan was ineffective, so I changed to Bawei Pill. After about ten days, all symptoms improved.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>Wujiang&#39;s Shi Anqing&#39;s son suffered from a cold. After using a medicine to disperse and transform phlegm, he experienced an increase in phlegm and cough, with a swollen abdomen and pale complexion. This indicated that the spleen&#39;s deficiency could not generate the lung&#39;s essence. I administered a dose of the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Platycodon and he recovered immediately. However, after three days, the previous symptoms returned, with a runny nose; this was again caused by a cold, so I used the previous medicine with added Mulberry Bark, Apricot Kernel, and Platycodon, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Shi Shaocan&#39;s son had wheezing and coughing, along with an expanded chest and abdomen, diarrhea, and poor appetite. This was due to dietary harm to the spleen&#39;s essence, which could not produce the lung&#39;s essence. I prescribed one dose of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>Shi Muchuan, aged six, caught a cold and had a cough. After excessive dispersing, he experienced wheezing and loss of appetite. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additional Platycodon and he recovered. It was April, and while accompanying his father inspecting the fields, he suddenly developed chills and resumed coughing. Although some used a medicine to dispel the cold, there was blood in the phlegm. I indicated this was a result of lung abscess. The next day, he coughed up phlegm with pus and recovered after using Platycodon Decoction. Later, his vitality had not fully returned; his bowel movements resembled dysentery, and he sometimes used Five-Ingredient, Coptis, and Bitter Orange preparations. With symptoms of phlegm and wheezing, and extremities twitching, I concluded this was due to weakened spleen qi transforming into chronic spleen wind. He refused treatment, and this indeed was the case.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　伤寒正受伤寒夹惊</p>
<p>　　小儿伤寒，初得浑身发热无汗，多啼哭，看眼急有如惊风，但用发散退热，莫令发渴；如渴便欲饮水不歇，当发散，羌活散、三黄散、柴胡散、抱龙丸；或虚烦，可用竹叶汤。如嫩小儿当服洗心散、薄荷散、红绵散，四肢发汗，自然精神喜悦。感伤寒之重者，当依仲景之法治之。又有伤寒夹惊，先要发散，其热乃退。化痰截惊，乳下婴儿抱龙丸，羌活散加荆芥、防风，三黄散，微利痰热；次用柴胡、黄芩药调理，管取向安。葱白汤方可服。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　小儿伤寒与时气同异</p>
<p>　　夫小儿伤寒，得之与大人无异，所异治者，兼惊而已。又有因夹惊食而得，治法与大人一同，但小其分剂，使药性少瘥耳。仲景云：春气温和，夏气炎热，秋气清凉，冬气冷冽，此则四时正气之序也。冬时严寒，触冒之者，乃名伤寒耳。其伤于四时之气，皆能为病。冬受寒毒之气，其即时而病者，头痛身疼，肌肤热而恶寒，名曰伤寒，其不即时病者，寒毒藏于肌肤之间，至春夏阳气发生，则寒毒与阳气相搏于荣卫之间，其病与冬时即病无异，但因春而发名曰温病，至夏而发名曰热病。阳热未盛，为寒所制，病名为温；阳热已盛，寒不能制，病名为热。故太医均谓之伤寒也。然热病、伤寒、温病。时气，传变无异也。凡时气者，四时之间有不正之气也。如春应暖而反寒，夏应热而反冷，秋应凉而反热，冬应寒而反温，非其时而有其气。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>气之中人，则头疼壮热咳嗽气粗，烦渴心躁，恍忽惊悸，传变与伤寒无异。故一岁之中，病无长少，率相似者，此则时行之气，俗谓之天行是也。治法：三四月或有暴寒，其时阳气尚弱，为寒所折，病热犹轻，升麻汤解肌汤主之。五六月阳气已盛，为寒所折，病热则重；七八月阳气已衰，为寒所折，病热亦微。调中汤、射干汤、半夏桂甘汤可选用也。秋温冬温，治湿则利小便。治冬温亦宜解利。其利小便也，则以五苓散辈；其解利冬温，宜葳蕤汤。盖冬温者，感温气而作。寒疫者，暴寒折人，非触冒之过，其治法不同，所施寒热温凉之剂亦异，不可拘以日数，发汗吐下，随证施行。要之治热以寒，温而行之；治温以清，冷而行之；治寒以热，凉而行之；治清以温，热而行之。以平为期，不可以过，此为大法。汤氏有七宝散，加减服之，并与乳母尤好。有热者，升麻汤加柴胡、黄芩等剂治之，柴胡石膏汤极效。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　　伤寒表里</p>
<p>　　凡治小儿伤寒，须辨表里，表里不分，汗下差误。古人云：桂枝下咽，阳盛即毙；承气入胃，阴盛以亡。伤寒有表证，有里证，有半在表、半在里，有表里二证俱见。然在表者宜汗，在里者宜下，在半表半里者宜和解，表里俱见，随证施治。无表里证，用大柴胡汤下之。其表证者，发热恶寒，身体痛而脉浮，无汗头疼，项强腰脊痛；此足太阳膀胱经受病也，宜汗之。然伤寒发表，当随病轻重而汗之，头疼发热兼惊，亦只用葱白汤汗之，甚则麻黄汤、各半汤、解肌汤、葛根汤、柴胡散，皆可选而用之。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>其里证者，恶热而不恶寒，手掌心并腋下濈濈汗出，胃中干，咽燥，粪结聚，潮热，大便硬，小便如常，腹满而喘，躁渴脉沉而滑，内热而谵语，此属足阳明胃经也，宜下之，小承气汤、大承气汤、四顺饮、洗心散，斟酌轻重用之。其在半表半里者，心下满，口不欲食，大便硬，脉沉细，是里证，当下；其人头汗出，微恶寒，手足冷，即当汗。此两证俱见者，仲景所谓半在表半在里也，小柴胡汤主之。太阳病不解，传入少阳，胁下硬满，干呕不能入饮食，往来寒热，尚未吐下，诊其脉弦紧者，小柴胡汤主之，此属少阳胆经也，宜和解。其表里两证俱见者，病人脉浮而大，是表证，当汗；其人发热烦渴，小便赤，是里证，当下。是表里证俱见，五苓散主之。又伤寒不大便六七日，头痛有热者是也，里证当下；其人小便清者，知不在里，仍在表，当须发汗。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>此是两证俱见，即未可下，宜与桂枝汤。又太阳病医反下之，因亦腹痛，是有表复有里，仲景用桂枝加芍药汤，痛甚者桂枝加大黄汤；或腹满时痛，尺寸脉俱浮洪者，此足太阴脾经也，自利不渴当温之，四逆汤理中汤。其无表里者，伤寒四五日以后，以至过经无表里证，又于里证未可下者，既非下证，亦非汗证，皆可用小柴胡汤随证加减用之。以至十余日外用小柴胡汤不愈者，若大便硬，看可下，则用大柴胡汤下之。仲景云：六七日目中不了了，睛不和，无表里证，大便难，身微热，此为实也，当下，宜大承气汤。若不渴口不燥，舌干而脉沉者，急温之，宜四逆汤。此足少阴肾经也。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>其表热里寒者，身大热而反欲得衣，热在皮肤，寒在骨髓也，宜先与阴旦汤；塞已，次以小柴胡汤加桂，以温其表。又身大寒而反不欲近衣，寒在皮肤，热在骨髓也，宜先与白虎加人参汤；热除，次以桂枝麻黄各半汤以解其外。又厥阴证脉浮缓者，必囊不缩，外证必发热恶寒似疟，为欲愈，宜桂枝麻黄各半汤。若脉尺寸俱沉短者，必囊缩，毒气入脏，宜承气汤下之。厥阴病，其脉微浮为欲愈，不浮为未愈，宜小建中汤，此足厥阴肝经也。然以表里证内近似三阴三阳之证，而疏于各证之下，非可以尽备六经之大法也，当以《活人书》、《伤寒论》为主。其疟证与大方治法同，后有本条。夏伤于暑，秋必痎疟。其暑证玉露散主之，其详亦与大方同其治法，但用分剂轻耳。《口议》有脱甲散，大能除热，扶表救里，真良方也！<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>　　　　　伤寒咳嗽伤风</p>
<p>　　仲阳云：咳嗽者，肺感微寒，八九月间肺气大旺，病嗽者其病必实，非久病也，其证面赤，身热痰盛，法当以葶苈丸下之；若久嗽，不可下也。冬月嗽，乃伤风咳也，当以麻黄汤汗之；有热证面赤饮水，涎痰浓稠，咽喉不利者，宜甘桔汤；有肺盛者嗽而后喘，面肿欲饮水，有不饮水者，其身即热，以泻白散泻之；有嗽而吐涎痰，乳食者，以白饼子下之。然肺主气，应于皮毛，肺为五脏华盖，小儿感于风寒，客于皮肤，入伤肺经，微者咳嗽，重者喘急。肺伤于寒则嗽，多痰涎，喉中鸣急，肺伤于暖，则嗽声不通雍滞。伤于寒者必散寒邪，伤于暖者必泄壅滞。发散属以甘辛，即桂枝、麻黄、细辛是也；涌泄系以酸苦，即葶苈、大黄是也。更五味子、乌梅之酸，可以敛肺气，亦治咳嗽之要药也，久嗽不已，必生惊悸顽涎，血脉灌脸。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>其嗽传受五脏，或吐逆，或痰涎，或厥冷，或恐悸，甚而至于眼目两眶，紫黑如被物伤损，眼白红赤如血。谓之血眼。治之之法、当用生地黄及湿黑豆研成膏，掩眼上，而眼肿黑自消，其血皆自眼泪而出，真良方也。兼服麦煎散而嗽自止。久嗽成癎，当服散癎等剂。凡治嗽先要发散寒邪，然后服宽气化痰止嗽之药，即得痊瘥。先服九宝丸、华盖散、葶苈丸、抱龙丸，或细辛五味子汤；如有热可服凉肺之药，柴胡、黄芩等剂，并泻白散；痰多气喘，用金星丸；利痰了，却服前药，后服百部丸、生犀散、天麻定喘饮，调理而安。冷证咳嗽，小青龙汤加杏仁，去麻黄，亦可服。有热及时气咳嗽，柴胡散加杏仁、五味子，柴胡石膏汤亦可，钱氏生犀散加减亦佳。有惊咳嗽，天麻防风丸治之。惺惺散、化风丹皆可服。金沸草散、三拗汤加减，乃治伤风咳嗽之常剂也。和解汤治四时感冒，可加减服。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　　　明医杂着 【明　王纶】</p>

<p>　　小儿八岁以下，无伤寒，虽有感冒伤风，鼻塞流涕，发热咳嗽，以降痰为主，略加微解。凡散利败毒，非幼稚所宜。感冒轻者不必用药，候二三日多有自愈。　　 【注　按前证，若手足冷或腹胀，脾虚也，用六君子汤加升麻、柴胡；若腹胀或气喘，肺虚也，用四君子汤加柴胡、升麻。经云：肺主气而司皮毛，肺虚则腠理不密，外邪易感。凡发表之后，其邪既去，用补脾肺以实其表，庶风邪不能再入；往往表散之后，热嗽不退，复行发表，多变坏证。】<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　　　古今医统 【明　徐春甫】</p>

<p>　　小儿伤寒，与大人无异，所以异者，兼有夹食而已。而或偶而中伤，谓之时气，又与伤寒不同。若小儿在襁褓中，或长成而禀赋怯弱，多因乳母解脱衣服，不避风寒所致也。然小儿患此，口不能言其致病之由，脉不能诊其必然之理，但只烦啼发热而已，故不可不尽心焉。初得之时，婴幼则以虎口三关脉纹红色验之，长而童稚，则以一指按其三部，据左手脉之紧盛而断之。其喘急憎寒，心气热，呵欠烦闷，项急者是也。其恶寒恶风，必偎人藏身，引衣密隐，是为表证。恶热内实者，必出头露面，扬手掷足，烦渴燥粪，掀衣气粗，是为里证。至若头额冷汗，手足凉，口冷气，面色黑暗淡，大便泻青，此为阴证。视其小便或赤或白，可以知里热之有无；或青或浊，可以知里证之轻重。举是观之，则汗下清温之法，可类推矣。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>

<p><strong>Childhood Wind and Cold</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Febrile Disease</strong></p>
<p>It is said: Children who have not been exposed to frost and snow do not fall ill from febrile diseases. Adults may suffer from cold for a long time, but this is not the concern here. However, when the weather is out of season, children may still become ill. Sometimes, during epidemic years, children can show symptoms like rashes after childbirth. In treating seasonal illnesses, the methods are similar to those for adults, but the doses of medication should be smaller and cooler.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Formula for Children</strong> (Song dynasty, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Wind Cold with Variations in Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When a child has a cold and is overly sleepy with a warm breath and feels uneasy, use large blue ointment to disperse it. If they continuously drink cold water and have a good appetite, use a small dose of rhubarb pills. Other remedies should not be purgative. For cold hands and feet, which indicate spleen deficiency, use nourishing yellow powder to warm the spleen and stomach along with large blue ointment to dispel wind pathogens. If the child is experiencing diarrhea due to a cold and has a weak spleen, use nourishing yellow powder and large blue ointment; if not healed, administer regulating middle pills. For cases of diarrhea, give rhubarb pills, followed later by warming and calming pills. If there is abdominal bloating or wheezing due to a weak spleen, first disperse and then reinforce the spleen. If the cold affects the liver, it will cause convulsions and restlessness; if it affects the heart, there will be anxiety; if it affects the lungs, there will be wheezing and coughing; if it affects the spleen, it will lead to drowsiness; if it affects the kidneys, the child may be sensitive to light. Each condition should be treated based on the organ that is affected.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the case of children with cold injuries, initially, there will be a fever without sweating, and they may cry excessively, appearing startled as if affected by sudden fright. One should use methods to dissipate heat without allowing thirst to develop; if thirst arises, they desire to drink water continuously, which indicates the need for dissipation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Children&#39;s Febrile Illness and Seasonal Differences</p>
<p>Children’s febrile illness, whether acquired or experienced by adults, is fundamentally the same; the only difference in treatment is that children may also be startled. It can also arise from being startled while eating. The treatment method is similar to that for adults, but the dosage is smaller, resulting in a milder effect of the medicine. Zhang Zhongjing stated: in spring, the air is warm and gentle; in summer, it is hot and intense; in autumn, it is cool and refreshing; in winter, it is cold and bitter. This is the proper sequence of the four seasonal energies. When winter is harshly cold, those who encounter it are said to suffer from febrile illness. Any adverse effects of the seasonal energies can lead to illness. If one is afflicted by cold toxins in winter, the immediate symptoms include headache, body aches, fever, and chills, termed febrile illness. If symptoms do not appear immediately, the cold toxins may remain hidden in the skin, and as the yang energy rises in spring and summer, these toxins conflict with the yang in the body&#39;s protective system, producing a condition similar to the immediate illness experienced in winter, but due to its emergence in spring, it is termed a warm disease, and if it occurs in summer, it is termed a hot disease. When the yang heat is not yet abundant and is restricted by cold, it is called a warm illness; when the yang heat is abundant and cold cannot restrict it, it is called a hot illness. Therefore, the great physicians refer to it as febrile illness. However, hot diseases, febrile illnesses, and warm diseases are all variations of seasonal ailments that can change and intermingle. Seasonal ailments arise from improper experiences of the seasonal energies. For instance, if spring should be warm but is cold instead, summer should be hot but is cold, autumn should be cool but is hot, and winter should be cold but is warm, it is improper for the season to present such energies.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of illnesses caused by seasonal influences, symptoms can include headaches, fever, cough, rough breathing, irritability and thirst, a restless heart, confusion, and anxiety, resembling conditions like typhoid. Therefore, throughout the year, one may experience various ailments, which often appear similar; this is known as the seasonal wind or what people refer to as &quot;heavenly influences.&quot; </p>
<p>Treatment methods: In March and April, if there is a sudden cold, the yang energy is still weak and can be affected by the cold, leading to milder heat symptoms. In such cases, the Shegan Decoction or Sang Ju San is prescribed. In May and June, as the yang energy increases, if affected by cold, the heat symptoms can become severe; in July and August, as the yang energy declines, the cold can again have a lesser effect. The Tiaozhong Decoction, Shegan Decoction, and Banxia Guizhi Decoction can be selected for use. </p>
<p>In autumn and winter, treatment for dampness is aimed at promoting urination. For winter heat, it is also advisable to relieve and promote urination. For promoting urination, the Wuling San can be used; for relieving winter heat, the Weirui Decoction is appropriate. Winter heat arises from the influence of warm energies. Cold epidemics cause sudden cold effects on people; this is not due to exposure but is treated differently, and the herbs for cold and heat are also different. One should not rigidly adhere to a fixed timeframe for treatment but should adjust sweating, vomiting, or purging according to symptoms. </p>
<p>In summary, to treat heat, use cold methods; to treat warmth, use clearing methods; to treat cold, apply heating methods; to treat clarity, use warm methods. Aim for balance and avoid excess, which is the fundamental principle. The Tang family has the Seven Treasures Powder, which can be adjusted and taken, especially beneficial for nursing mothers. For those with heat symptoms, adding Chai Hu and Huang Qin to the Shegan Decoction is effective, and the Chai Hu Shigao Decoction is particularly potent.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating pediatric typhoid fever, it is essential to distinguish between exterior and interior conditions. Without this distinction, sweating or purging may be misguided. Ancient sages said: &quot;With Gui Zhi, if the Yang is excessive, it leads to death; with Cheng Qi, if the Yin is excessive, it leads to disaster.&quot; Typhoid has both exterior symptoms and interior symptoms; some may present as half exterior and half interior, while others may show both conditions at once. </p>
<p>For those with exterior symptoms, sweating is advisable; for those with interior symptoms, purging is appropriate. In cases of mixed symptoms, harmonizing treatment is necessary. If there are no distinct exterior or interior symptoms, administer Da Chai Hu Decoction. </p>
<p>Exterior symptoms include fever, chills, body aches, a floating pulse, lack of sweating, headache, stiffness of the neck, and back pain; these indicate illness of the Tai Yang Bladder channel and should be treated with sweating. However, the method of sweating for exterior symptoms should depend on the severity of the illness. For headaches and fever accompanied by agitation, it may suffice to use Scallion White Decoction for sweating; for more severe cases, options include Ma Huang Decoction, Ge Gen Decoction, Xiao Feng San, and others, which can all be selected for use.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of interior syndrome, there is a dislike for heat but not for cold, with profuse sweating from the palms and armpits, dryness in the stomach, a dry throat, constipated stools, tidal fever, hard stools, normal urination, a full abdomen with shortness of breath, restlessness and thirst, a deep and slippery pulse, and internal heat causing delirium; this indicates a pattern of the Stomach meridian of the Foot Yangming and should be treated with purgatives such as Xiao Chengqi Decoction, Da Chengqi Decoction, Si Shun Drink, and Xixin Powder, used according to the severity. </p>
<p>In cases that are both half-exterior and half-interior, where there is fullness beneath the heart, lack of appetite, hard stools, and a deep, thin pulse, this is an interior syndrome and should be purged; if the person has sweating on the head, a slight aversion to cold, and cold hands and feet, then sweating should be induced. When both of these syndromes are present, as mentioned by Zhongjing, this is called half in the exterior, half in the interior, and should be treated with Xiao Chaihu Decoction.</p>
<p>In cases of Taiyang disease not resolving and transitioning into Shaoyang, with hardness and fullness beneath the ribs, dry retching unable to accept food and drink, and alternating chills and fever, if the pulse is taut and tight, then Xiao Chaihu Decoction is indicated, as this pertains to the Shaoyang Gallbladder meridian, and harmonization is necessary. </p>
<p>If both exterior and interior symptoms are present, and the patient has a floating and large pulse, this indicates an exterior syndrome, and sweating should be applied; if the person has fever, thirst, and red urination, this indicates an interior syndrome, and purgation is necessary. Thus, in cases where both exterior and interior symptoms appear together, Wu Ling San is the appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a person with a fever has not defecated for six or seven days and has a headache with heat, this indicates an interior syndrome that should be purged; if the person’s urination is clear, it shows that the condition is still in the exterior, and sweating must be induced.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This indicates that both symptoms are present; therefore, it is not appropriate to purge. It is advisable to use Gui Zhi Decoction. Furthermore, in cases of Taiyang disease, if the physician purges, and there is also abdominal pain, this indicates an exterior condition combined with an interior condition. Zhang Zhongjing employed Gui Zhi Decoction with Shao Yao. If the pain is severe, Gui Zhi Decoction with Da Huang is used; or if the pain occurs when the abdomen is distended and both pulse readings are floating and surging, this corresponds to the Foot Taiyin Spleen Meridian. If there is free bowel movement and no thirst, it should be warmed with Si Ni Decoction or Li Zhong Decoction. If there are no exterior or interior symptoms after four or five days of febrile disease and the case has exceeded the time without exterior or interior symptoms, and if there are still interior symptoms that should not be purged, these cases are neither purging nor sweating conditions, and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction can be used, adjusting according to symptoms. If after ten days of using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction there is no improvement, if the stools are hard and purging is deemed necessary, then Da Chai Hu Decoction should be used to purge them. Zhang Zhongjing states that if after six or seven days the eyes are unclear, the vision is not harmonious, and there are no exterior or interior symptoms, with difficult stool and slight feverishness of the body, this signifies a solid condition, and it should be purged using Da Cheng Qi Decoction. If there is no thirst, the mouth is not dry, but the tongue is dry and the pulse is deep, urgent warming is required, suggesting Si Ni Decoction is appropriate.

<p>For the condition of Jueyin, where the pulse is floating and weak, the bag must not contract, and the exterior symptoms must feature fever and chills resembling malaria, indicating a desire for recovery. Therefore, one should use a decoction of equal parts cinnamon twig and ephedra.

<p>In Jueyin disease, if the pulse is slightly floating this indicates a desire for recovery; if not floating, recovery is not yet achieved.

The symptoms include a flushed face, body heat, and abundant phlegm, which should be treated with Ting Li Wan. However, if the cough has persisted for a long time, it should not be purged.</p>
<p>In winter, cough is due to a wind cold, which should be treated with Ma Huang Tang to induce sweating. If there is a red face, drinking water, and thick phlegm with an obstructed throat, Gan Ju Tang should be used. In cases where lung qi is high leading to coughing and then wheezing, with facial swelling and a desire to drink water, but the person refrains, their body is definitely hot, and Bai Shao San should be used to purge it. If there is coughing with expectoration of phlegm, and a diet of milk or dairy, then Bai Bing Zi should be administered.</p>
<p>The lungs govern qi and are related to the skin and hair; they are the protective cover of the five zang organs. Young children affected by wind and cold, as it gets to their skin, can harm the lung channels, causing mild coughing or severe wheezing. If the lungs are injured by cold, there will be a cough with abundant phlegm, and a rapid sound in the throat. If injured by warmth, then the cough will be congested and obstructed. </p>
<p>Cold-induced injuries require expelling the cold pathogens, while warmth-induced injuries require draining the obstruction. To disperse cold, use sweet and pungent herbs like Gui Zhi, Ma Huang, and Xi Xin; for draining, use sour and bitter herbs like Ting Li and Da Huang. Additionally, the sourness of Wu Mei and Wu Wei Zi can help restrain lung qi and are vital medicines for treating cough. If a cough persists, it will definitely lead to a sensation of fright, stubborn phlegm, and blood vessels bursting in the face.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing affects the five internal organs; it may result in reverse flow, phlegm and drool, coldness, or palpitations. In severe cases, the area around the eyes can become purple and black as if injured, with the whites of the eyes appearing red like blood. This is referred to as &quot;blood eyes.&quot; The method of treatment involves using raw Rehmannia and moist black beans ground into a paste and applied over the eyes. The swelling and darkness will reduce, and blood will flow out as tears, truly an excellent remedy. Additionally, taking wheat decoction powder will help stop the cough.</p>
<p>If the cough has persisted for a long time and has become a chronic condition, one should take powder to treat the syndrome. Generally, in treating a cough, one must first dispel the cold pathogen, then take medicine to relieve phlegm and stop the cough to achieve recovery. One should first take Nine Treasure Pills, Huagai Powder, Tingli Pills, or Baolong Pills; or a decoction of Chuanxiong and Schisandra. If there is heat, cooling herbs for the lung such as Chaihu and Huangqin can be employed, along with Baihua Powder; if there is abundant phlegm and shortness of breath, use Jinxing Pills. When phlegm is cleared, return to the previous remedies, then take Baibu Pills, Shengxi Powder, and Tianma Decoction to regulate and stabilize.</p>
<p>For cough due to cold, Xiao Qinglong Decoction plus apricot kernels, excluding ephedra, is also appropriate. For cough due to heat and timely Qi, Chaihu Powder with apricot kernels and Schisandra or Chaihu Shigao Decoction may also be good. Modified Qian&#39;s Shengxi Powder works well too. For cough due to fright, Tianma Fangfeng Pills are effective. Both Xingxing Powder and Huafeng Dan are applicable. Jinfencao Powder and San&#39;ao Decoction, with adjustments, are common remedies for cough from a cold. Hejie Decoction can be taken for colds at any time of the year, with adjustments as necessary.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>For children under eight years old, without signs of a cold, even if they have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, fever, and cough due to a cold, the focus should be on reducing phlegm, with slight relief. Remedies that disperse and eliminate pathogens are not suitable for the young. For mild colds, there is no need for medication, as many tend to recover on their own within two or three days. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there are signs such as cold hands and feet or abdominal distension, which indicate spleen deficiency, use &quot;Six Gentleman Decoction&quot; with the addition of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu; if there is abdominal distension or shortness of breath indicating lung deficiency, use &quot;Four Gentleman Decoction&quot; with Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. The classics state: &quot;The lungs govern Qi and control the skin and hair. If the lungs are deficient, the pores are not tight, making it easy to be affected by external pathogens.&quot; After dispersing the exterior, once the pathogen is eliminated, it is important to tonify the spleen and lungs to consolidate the exterior, preventing the wind pathogen from re-entering; often, after dispersing the exterior, if heat cough persists, repeating exterior dispersal can lead to complications.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical System</strong><br><strong>Ming - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Febrile Diseases in Children</strong>  </p>
<p>Febrile diseases in children are no different from those in adults; the distinction lies primarily in their susceptibility to improper feeding. Sometimes, they may suffer from external influences known as seasonal afflictions, which are different from mere febrile illnesses. If an infant is weak or has a frail constitution, it is often due to the wet nurse neglecting to keep them warm and exposing them to cold winds. However, children cannot articulate the reasons for their ailments, nor can their pulses reveal clear diagnoses; they only show signs of irritability and fever, which necessitates careful attention.  </p>
<p>At the onset of illness, for infants, the redness of the pulse at the tiger&#39;s mouth and the three positions can be examined. For older children, one should press one finger on the three levels and determine the condition by assessing the tightness and fullness of the pulse in the left hand. Symptoms include wheezing, fear of cold, heat in the chest, yawning, irritability, and stiffness of the neck. If they show aversion to cold winds and seek warmth, huddling close to others and keeping their bodies covered, these are considered exterior symptoms.  </p>
<p>If they have internal heat, they will seek to expose their heads and limbs, showing restlessness, thirst, dryness in stools, and a tendency to throw off their coverings. This indicates interior symptoms. On the other hand, if there is cold sweat on the forehead, coolness in the hands and feet, a cold mouth, dark and pale complexion, and dark diarrhea, this is indicative of a yin condition. Observing the urine, whether red or white, can indicate the presence of internal heat; if it is dark or turbid, this reveals the severity of the internal condition.  </p>
<p>From these observations, one may deduce the appropriate method of inducing sweating and using warm remedies.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Pediatric Hygiene - On Febrile Illness</strong></p>
<p>The classic text states: There are five types of febrile illnesses: stroke, heat diseases, warm diseases, dampness diseases, and cold diseases, each causing different suffering. These five align with the five energies and correspond to the four seasons for diseases. Thus, spring corresponds to wind, summer to heat, autumn to dampness, winter to cold, and the central season to warmth, with cold residing in one category. Detailed discussions can be found in the classifications of febrile illnesses. The diseases of the four seasons, all referred to as cold illnesses, are general terms. </p>
<p>Internal heat diseases occur during the height of summer, caused by exposure to hot and humid air, also known as &quot;heatstroke.&quot; Damp diseases arise from exposure to rain, dew, frost, mist, smoke, and moisture. Young children are not subject to these two forms of illness because they do not engage in household chores, do not become fatigued, and tend to go to bed early and rise late, avoiding excessive exposure. </p>
<p>Young children can suffer from three illnesses: wind, cold, and warm diseases due to severe cold, strong winds, and pervasive warm air. Children&#39;s muscles are delicate, and their qi and blood are weak, making them easily injured. For these three diseases, diagnosis through pulse examination is not viable; slightly older children can have their pulses checked for diagnosis.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse in a case of wind injury is floating in the yang and weak in the yin; the pulse in a case of cold injury has both yin and yang flourishing but is tight and thick; the pulse in a case of warm disease moves through various meridians, and it is unknown which meridian is affected, so the pulse is taken according to where it is located. If a child is too young to be diagnosed through pulse taking, one should observe their physical condition.</p>
<p>Wind injury refers to the harmful winds of all seasons and directions that affect people, presenting symptoms of drowsiness, yawning, irritability, hot breath, occasional sweating with aversion to wind, fever, nasal congestion with dry retching, more heat than cold, a radiant but not pale face, and heat in the hands and feet, alongside restlessness. The treatment should be dispersive. Some can drink water and eat, while others cannot eat. Those who can drink and eat may be treated with gentle purging; the rest should not be purged.</p>
<p>Cold injury, on the other hand, is caused by the severe cold air of winter that harms individuals by penetrating the skin. At that time, robust individuals merely experience qi movement, while the weak develop illness. The immediate onset of this condition is termed cold injury. If it occurs in spring, it is termed warm disease. One might also say that if it occurs before the summer solstice, it is not a seasonal warm disease. If it occurs in summer, it is classified as a heat disease; if after the summer solstice, it is not due to heatstroke.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<p>Those with wind-cold do not dislike cold but dislike wind; those with cold-illness do not dislike wind but dislike cold. The one who dislikes wind feels cold when exposed to it; the one who dislikes cold may also feel cold even without exposure to wind. This distinguishes between the two.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the patient presents with a headache, heaviness in the body, strong fever, and body aches, it resembles typhoid fever. However, by observing the pulse and symptoms, one must determine which meridian is affected by the illness and treat according to that meridian. The three conditions mentioned above are all treated as if they were typhoid fever. If the pathogen is external, it should be released through sweating; if it is internal, it should be warmed and purged. Treatment should be carried out according to the symptoms and established methods. Qian Yi mentioned that for men suffering from typhoid, the body is heavy and the face is yellow; for women, there is rapid breathing and a red face, both despising cold, with hot breath in the mouth, frequent yawning, and feelings of restlessness. This description does not differentiate between cold and typhoid but addresses them generally. Furthermore, cold and typhoid have multiple variations in symptoms, and there are established methods for each specific condition. Master Sun stated that the treatment for children and adults is no different, except that the quantity of medicinal decoctions should be reduced significantly. There are also cases of cold combined with food intake, commonly referred to as &quot;combined food and typhoid.&quot; The symptoms include strong fever, thirst, nasal congestion, heavy voice, fatigue in the limbs, yellowing of the eyes, abdominal distension and pain, salivation, vomiting, or yawning and restlessness. In treatment, one should not first attack the site of injury but rather release the exterior. Once the exterior is resolved, one can then address the internal issues, and both the illness and the food problems will subside; if one disregards the exterior and directly attacks with medicine, it can lead to stagnation and pain.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one suffers from hunger and consumes cold food and drinks, it harms the spleen and stomach, leading to a cold invasion. The signs include discomfort in the chest, abdominal distension and pain, a pale complexion with bluish lips, cold extremities, and a deep, fine pulse. This indicates cold injury to the spleen, belonging to the Taiyin category. Inexperienced practitioners misdiagnose this as simple discomfort in the chest and rashly resort to acupuncture or laxatives, which only worsen the discomfort leading to vomiting and diarrhea. Within just a couple of days, this can result in a critical condition, which reflects a lack of understanding in treatment. </p>
<p>There are many medicinal signs in the classic texts for cold injury, which are difficult to fully describe. Here, I will summarize common cases seen in children and those with overlapping symptoms. For those experiencing cold-induced symptoms like cold hands and feet, fever, reddened face, and headache—this indicates a weak spleen, and one should first harmonize the spleen before dispersing the cold. For those with cold-induced diarrhea, this indicates spleen deficiency, and one should first tonify the spleen before dispersing the cold. If the illness is not yet resolved, one must first regulate the internal condition. If there are signs of diarrhea, one may use mild purging; if there&#39;s shock, one should calm it. </p>
<p>For cold-induced abdominal distension accompanied by wheezing, this indicates spleen deficiency, and one should first strengthen the spleen to relieve distension and stabilize breathing. Once the breathing is stable, then one may disperse the cold.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one suffers from a cold and experiences heat following the cold, if the intense heat has receded but residual heat remains, it indicates excessive treatment of the cold, resulting in a deficiency of the stomach that allows heat to take hold. If there is deficient heat in the stomach, even if it is not much, it is important to generate fluid in the stomach; when fluids are produced, the heat will subside naturally.</p>
<p>When one is attacked by cold and the heat manifests outwardly, it is classified as an exterior condition. If the heat has not penetrated inward, both conditions must be resolved accordingly. If there is internal deficiency and reversed qi, resulting in heat accumulating and hardening in the chest causing pain, this is known as chest constriction; if there is only fullness and hardness without pain, it is known as phlegm qi; if the condition arises after drinking water, it is termed water accumulation. </p>
<p>If the external heat has penetrated inward for three to four days, it can cause abdominal fullness and phlegm if there are dry stools; in such cases, one must induce a bowel movement. If the heat enters the large intestine, it results in constipation with hard stools; if it enters the small intestine, it leads to difficulty in urination; if heat infiltrates both large and small intestines, it results in complete obstruction of both urination and defecation. </p>
<p>When heat enters the spleen and stomach, which are associated with the earth element and are reflected in the muscles, excess heat may manifest externally as jaundice. If the heat consumes the heart and chest area, it may lead to restlessness; if the bodily fluids are depleted, it results in thirst, and if the heat rushes upward affecting the throat and tongue, it causes sores, swelling, and pain. </p>
<p>In cases of blood loss, if blood is heated, it may overflow uncontrollably: if it flows from the nose, it is called nosebleed; if it comes from the mouth, it is termed hematemesis; if it appears in the stool, it is bloody diarrhea; and if it is found in the urine, it is referred to as hematuria.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the strong heat has not yet caused sweating, accompanied by restlessness, panting, and nasal wheezing, but there is a rise in blood pressure and the heat subsides, then the illness is resolved; however, if the discharge reaches two or three liters, it is dangerous. If the heat toxin is full within and does not descend in time, leading to toxins overwhelming stagnant blood, then severe agitation and mania will arise. If there is a combination of heat and cold causing confusion and heaviness, it can lead to death. If there is cold in the stomach causing disturbance, it will result in vomiting, belching, and rebellious qi; if there is cold in the lungs, it will lead to coughing and shortness of breath; if the qi is weak and transforms into yin, it will result in cold limbs, a pale face, body coldness, and clear diarrhea.

<p>Qian Yi discusses colds and fevers, rashes, and eating disorders, which all share similarities. If one cannot discern between them in a rush, administering Shengma Gancao Decoction, Xingsheng Powder, or Xiaochaihu Decoction—a few medicines serve as effective general treatments.</p>
<p>The &quot;Shenghui&quot; also states that in cases of infantile fevers, one must not use excessively drying medicines to induce sweating, as drying can injure the organs. Extreme heat can harm the heart, making reversal difficult. Furthermore, one should not use hot medicines, as heat supports yang; when yang is extreme, yin contends, resulting in profuse sweating like oil from the limbs, which may be alternately cold or hot, often leading to agitation, seizures, and convulsions, making them difficult to treat.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

If heat rises to the head, it can cause the skull sutures to open, making it difficult to treat. I found myself in Qiantang, staying at the home of a relative, Su Bozheng, a well-known practitioner of medicine for treating typhoid fever. I often observed his method of prescribing medication. When a child suffers from typhoid fever with strong heat, symptoms like headache, body aches, a strong pulse, nasal congestion, heavy voice, sneezing, coughing, yawning, aversion to wind, and dislike of cold, and the disease is on the surface leading to sweating, he would use Silver White Powder; if there&#39;s excessive heat, Sweet Dew Powder; for issues with food stagnation, where the stomach and spleen are not in harmony, he would use An Wei Pills intermittently; for chest discomfort, he would use Fragrant Shell Powder intermittently; for thirst and the urge to drink, or when alternating between cold and heat, he would use Ling Sha Powder intermittently; if there is fright, he would use Tianma Fangfeng Pills or Ginseng Wind Resolving Ointment; for excessive saliva and coughing, he would use Small Pearl Pills. With this treatment approach, the recovery rate is quite high, about eighty to ninety percent. Only one or two cases are ones where the illness has persisted deeply or has developed into a more severe condition. When called for treatment, if he follows the prescribed methods, recovery can be achieved. Most of the medicines he uses are not from ancient formulas, and they are not excessively warming. Generally, they are mild and balanced, demonstrating a keen understanding of the differences between cold and heat in various regions, as well as a profound comprehension of the ancient principles of disease treatment.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Febrile Illnesses</strong>  </p>
<p>In treating febrile illnesses, one must differentiate between exterior and interior conditions. Failure to make this distinction can lead to mistakes in sweating or purging. When the exterior condition is present, sweating is indicated; when the interior condition is present, purging is indicated. Attacking the interior when the exterior condition is present is not an effective method. The exterior conditions belong to Yang and affect the six bowels, while the interior conditions belong to Yin and affect the five organs. When Yang is excessive and Yin is deficient, sweating will lead to death, while purging should lead to recovery. Conversely, when Yang is deficient and Yin is excessive, purging will lead to death, while sweating should lead to recovery.<br>When Yang is deficient with external cold and Yin is deficient with internal heat, or when Yang is excessive with external heat and Yin is excessive with internal cold, inappropriate sweating will result in fluid overflow and exhaustion. Failure to sweat or excessive sweating will lead to obstruction of the openings and stagnation. Inappropriate purging or excessive purging will cause uncontrolled diarrhea. Failure to purge will lead to swelling and discomfort. Violating any of these principles may result in fatality.  </p>

Grind into powder. Take one to two qian (a unit of weight), decoct with ginger and mint water. Xue Ji said: According to the &quot;Secret Instructions,&quot; even if a child has a cold with symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, fever, and cough, the main focus is to reduce phlegm with slight relief from the symptoms. Generally, dispersing toxins is not suitable for young children. If symptoms are mild, it may not be necessary to use medicine; wait one to two days for self-recovery. I suggest that if symptoms include cold hands and feet or abdominal distension, indicating spleen deficiency, use Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction) with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma; if there is abdominal distension or weak breathing, indicating lung deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction) with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma. Indeed, if the lungs are deficient, the defensive qi is weak and external pathogens can easily enter. After expelling pathogens, the internal organs should be nourished to strengthen the surface, ensuring no changes in the condition.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Guizhi Decoction is used to treat a Taiyang wind condition, characterized by a floating yang and weak yin. When the yang is floating and heat arises, the weak yin leads to spontaneous sweating, aversion to cold, and intermittent feverish sensations, along with nasal congestion and dry retching. </p>
<p>The ingredients include: </p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 taels of cinnamon twig (桂枝) without the bark</li>
<li>1.5 taels of fresh ginger (生姜)</li>
<li>1.5 taels of peony root (芍药)</li>
<li>1 tael of honey-fried licorice root (炙草)</li>
<li>6 dates (枣子)</li>
</ul>
<p>This mixture is prepared into a decoction. Each dose is 3 qian, with a cup of water, boiled down to around 80%, then filtered. Adjust the dosage as needed. After taking the decoction, it is advised to consume a bowl of warm congee to enhance the medicinal effects, covering oneself well for about an hour. If there is a slight overall warmth and mild sweating, then the Guizhi Decoction may be further adjusted. </p>
<p>For those residing in the northwest and in all seasons, this remedy will certainly prove effective. In the Jianghuai region, it should only be used in winter and spring. From late spring to just before summer solstice, when there are symptoms of Guizhi, you may add one part of Huangqin, calling it Yindan Decoction. After the summer solstice, if there are Guizhi symptoms, half a tael of Zhimu and one tael of gypsum, or one part of Shengma may be added. </p>
<p>However, if the patient has long-standing deficiency and cold conditions, only the original formula should be used without adjustments. </p>
<p>A caution: Guizhi is the most difficult herb to use. Although it is said to resolve external conditions, it can induce sweating. The suitable case for Guizhi Decoction requires that the patient typically has spontaneous sweating, urination is infrequent, hands and feet are warm, perhaps with slight cold in hands and toes, and mildly bothersome body heat with aversion to cold. In such cases, it can be used. If the patient has no sweating, more frequent urination, cold hands and feet without aversion to cold, or if the individual dislikes sweet due to alcohol consumption, Guizhi should not be used. Moreover, if the symptoms of Guizhi have been present and the decoction was taken without resolution of those symptoms, it should not be administered again.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

Drinking ginger soup and strong liquor provided relief, but the pulse was thin and weak, and the two wrists felt almost absent. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of the fire of the Mingmen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wujiang&#39;s Shi Anqing&#39;s son suffered from a cold. After using a medicine to disperse and transform phlegm, he experienced an increase in phlegm and cough, with a swollen abdomen and pale complexion. This indicated that the spleen&#39;s deficiency could not generate the lung&#39;s essence. I administered a dose of the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Platycodon and he recovered immediately. However, after three days, the previous symptoms returned, with a runny nose; this was again caused by a cold, so I used the previous medicine with added Mulberry Bark, Apricot Kernel, and Platycodon, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Shi Shaocan&#39;s son had wheezing and coughing, along with an expanded chest and abdomen, diarrhea, and poor appetite. This was due to dietary harm to the spleen&#39;s essence, which could not produce the lung&#39;s essence. I prescribed one dose of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>Shi Muchuan, aged six, caught a cold and had a cough. After excessive dispersing, he experienced wheezing and loss of appetite. I used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additional Platycodon and he recovered. It was April, and while accompanying his father inspecting the fields, he suddenly developed chills and resumed coughing. Although some used a medicine to dispel the cold, there was blood in the phlegm. I indicated this was a result of lung abscess. The next day, he coughed up phlegm with pus and recovered after using Platycodon Decoction. Later, his vitality had not fully returned; his bowel movements resembled dysentery, and he sometimes used Five-Ingredient, Coptis, and Bitter Orange preparations. With symptoms of phlegm and wheezing, and extremities twitching, I concluded this was due to weakened spleen qi transforming into chronic spleen wind. He refused treatment, and this indeed was the case.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>
