<p><strong>Discussion on the Essential Truths</strong></p>
<p>When the Young Yin recovers, internal heat results, leading to external swelling and belching. <em>(Note: Belching refers to the irregular flow of Qi in the small intestine, ascending to the heart and resulting in belching.)</em> When the Yangming recovers, clear Qi rises strongly; in severe cases, there may be heart pain, fullness in the abdomen, diarrhea, bitter vomiting, cough and belching, restlessness, and the disease is in the diaphragm. <em>(Note: Coughing and belching indicate reversed lung Qi; coughing and restlessness signify the disease is in the diaphragm, and the Yangming Qi is ascending abnormally.)</em> When the Taiyang recovers, there is an ascent of deficiency Qi, leading to the spitting of clear water and belching. <em>(Note: Spitting clear water and belching indicates movement from the stomach upward to the heart.)</em></p>

<h3>Spleen Disease</h3>
<p>If the spleen is distended, there will be joy in belching, with urgency in the limbs, a heavy body, and a tendency to sigh. In cold conditions, there will be pain in the lower back and spine, a dark face with dry ears, inability to eat due to belching, or possibly vomiting blood.</p>
<h3>Febrile Disease Symptoms</h3>
<p>A reverse cough is what Zhang Zhongjing referred to as belching. Belching arises from cold in the stomach. Febrile disease is fundamentally deficient; attacking its heat must lead to belching. Moreover, it is said that if a febrile disease leads to extreme vomiting and diarrhea, and sweating is induced again, the person will have water stagnating, and if water is given to bring forth sweat, belching will occur. This is due to the coldness in the stomach. The treatment involves using dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, or a formula of Qiang Huo and Fu Zi, or a decoction of Ban Xia and ginger, or the Tui Yin San. If taking medicine does not heal, moxibustion will surely cure. The method: for women, bend the nipple down towards the bone in between, and moxibustion three times; for men and small-breasted individuals, take one finger as a measure. Position is important: men on the left, women on the right, burning moxa the size of a small bean directly above the pulsing artery midpoint. However, there are also those with a yang syndrome experiencing a reverse cough, treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang or tangerine peel and bamboo leaf decoction. Zhang Zhongjing also says: if belching occurs with abdominal fullness, by examining the front and back, one can discern which part is obstructed, and relieving that will lead to recovery. Zhang Zhongjing offers no specific formula. The front should use Zhu Ling Decoction, and the back should use Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Decoction. Bian Que&#39;s &quot;Zhong Cang Jing&quot; recommends for febrile cough and reverse cough, using the Clove Powder. Mix cloves and persimmon calyx each at one part, and licorice and ginger each at half a part; boil in hot water to form a dose, and consume it while hot for utmost efficacy.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>In Volume 11 of &quot;San Yin,&quot; there are also prescriptions such as Bamboo Rhizome Decoction and Clove Powder. Bamboo Rhizome Decoction treats Yang syndromes.</p>
<p>In Volume 8 of &quot;Ben Shi Fang,&quot; for treating the symptoms of cold damage, there is a prescription for cough and counterflow with Cardamom Decoction. For treating Yin syndrome&#39;s cough and counterflow, medications like Clove, Fennel, and Nutmeg are used, while they are unsuitable for Yang syndromes.</p>
<p>Coughing and counterflow often arise from initial heat followed by the intake of raw and cold substances or too many cooling medications, leading to conflicting Qi between Yin and Yang. A neighboring servant had a strong fever, and after using cooling medications excessively, experienced coughing and counterflow for four to five days. Eventually, only after taking Clove and Persimmon stem did they improve. Following that, they used Xiao Chai Hu for lingering heat and recovered afterwards, indicating that the fever was not fully resolved.</p>
<p>For treating cold damage with cough and counterflow, two prescriptions were subsequently provided by Mr. Zhou from Huagai Mountain in Fuzhou. One is an emergency prescription: half a tael of Cyperus tuber and tangerine seed, finely shredded, fried together in half a cup of wine until the medicine turns a golden yellow, ground into a fine powder. Take two qian with a small cup of water, decoct it until down to eight parts, and sip it slowly.</p>
<p>One formula uses only the powder of Cyperus, while another incorporates two cloves of garlic, sautéed and ground, mixed with white ginger powder, formed into pills the size of the seeds of the Wutong tree, and swallowed with the juice of Shao Cai in a dose of twenty pills. When the illness recedes, take another fifteen pills.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Ji Sheng Fang</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty - Yan Yonghe)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>The disease of coughing and reverse flow, upon careful examination of various texts, is not explicitly recorded. Only Master Sun mentions that there is no specific term for &quot;coughing and reverse flow&quot; in the discussions of herbal formulas, but that the ancients referred to it as &quot;coughing and reverse sounds.&quot; This often occurs after vomiting or purging, leading to a condition of emptiness and cold in the stomach, which gives rise to this symptom. There are also cases where stomach qi ascends with heat, resulting in coughing with eight or nine continuous sounds, where breath is unable to return. In such cases, one should carefully examine the pulse and symptoms and apply appropriate treatments. Generally, this condition is observed in the elderly, the weak, those suffering from prolonged illnesses, and women after childbirth. These are all signs of a deep-seated illness, not favorable omens.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Ming</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wujǐ)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>How can one clarify the signs of a febrile disease characterized by eructation? Eructation is commonly referred to as a reverse cough, which is characterized by a sound of gulping. If food obstructs the chest and throat, causing the qi to become blocked and unable to descend, there is no sound; this is purely a gastric disorder, albeit with varying degrees of severity. When there is a clash of vacuous cold and one drinks cold water, it induces a large sweating response; the cold qi clashes with the body, leading to eructation after consuming food, indicative of the depletion of gastric qi. After excessive vomiting and purging in cases of severe vacuity, if sweating recurs, it suggests the external qi is stagnant. If one then consumes water to induce sweating, it leads to eructation, which is due to the coldness in the stomach. Furthermore, if the stomach is vacuous and cold, making it unable to receive food, drinking water will also trigger eructation, indicating various gastric disorders. The classics mention: &quot;If the Fuyang pulse is floating, it indicates vacuity; if the Guan pulse is slippery, it indicates eructation.&quot; This suggests a medical fault, blaming the state of vacuity for the real issues at hand. In general, after excessive purging, if the qi in the stomach is reversed, it ultimately leads to eructation.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The classics state: If one purges a phlegmatic patient too early, it will cause vomiting; if the stomach is originally weak and one attacks its heat, it will cause vomiting; and in cases of Yangming disease where one cannot eat, attacking the heat will surely cause vomiting. All of these situations occur due to the stomach being weak after purging. However, burping is primarily due to the cold water clashing against the stomach, thus one must use Minor Blue Dragon Decoction, removing Ephedra and adding Aconite. As for burping, it is also caused by the obstruction of heat, where qi cannot flow properly. If mild, it indicates a need for harmonization; if severe, it indicates a need for purging. The classics state: When there are tidal fevers accompanied by burping, correlating with Minor Chaihu Decoction, this is a sign of harmonization. If there is burping along with abdominal fullness, by examining conditions before and after, one can understand which part is obstructed; relieving it will lead to recovery, which points to the need for purging. When a cold damage leads to burping, the illness has reached an extreme, unlike lighter conditions such as thirst or irritation. In cases of Sun Pattern Wind, where fire harms and causes sweating, both yin and yang are completely exhausted, leaving the body dry, with only head sweat coming, slightly returning to the neck, abdominal fullness, mild wheezing, dry mouth, and throat decay, and possibly no bowel movements—if prolonged, it leads to disorientation, and in severe cases to burping, indicating an extreme condition. Furthermore, if there is no urination along with abdominal fullness and burping, this condition cannot be treated and represents a true illness. In such cases, although there are divine methods, it’s a situation where one may be helpless; how could one possibly respond?<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Symptoms and Terminology</strong></p>
<p>Cough-reversal, commonly referred to as &#39;a-逆&#39; (e-reversing) or &#39;a-忒&#39; (e-taste), is mentioned only in the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; under the section on distinguishing the pulse. However, in the chapters on the six disorders and whether to induce sweating or purging, there is no mention of it. Later scholars, upon seeing the sections on the six disorders and whether to induce sweating or purging, noted that only &#39;a&#39; is mentioned without reference to cough-reversal, thus labeling it as cough-reversal. Alas! This assertion originated from Master Sun, followed by discussions from Zhu and Cheng, which led to confusion over the definitions of the two terms. The &quot;Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer&quot; states: If a patient appears as if they are panting without actually panting, as if they are vomiting without truly vomiting, and as if they are &#39;a&#39; without being &#39;a&#39;, yet feels bewildered in their chest with no relief, Ginger and Pinellia Decoction is indicated. For dry retching, &#39;a&#39;, or if there are symptoms of limb coldness, Orange Peel Decoction is indicated. For instances of &#39;a&#39; and cough-reversal, Orange Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction is indicated. From this, it is clear that Zhang Zhongjing only identifies it among those similar to dry retching and does not reference cough-reversal. Cough-reversal denotes a sound that abruptly starts and stops; although it may be repeated several times, it is short and quick, resembling a cough in its sound. Therefore, the mention of cough-reversal and &#39;a&#39; implies a desire to expel something but with nothing being expelled, characterized by a harsh and potent sound, lasting until the breath is exhausted before ceasing, unlike the light and less intense nature of dry retching. Thus, both arise from upward-reversed qi, which is why they are both described as &#39;reversed&#39;.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Although &quot;Shang Han&quot; distinguishes between cough and reverse flow using the pulse method, and considers cough with reverse flow to be related to hiccups, how can we be sure this is not simply a case of cough leading to breath reversal? Therefore, I cannot assert that it must be hiccups. &quot;Jin Kui Yao Lue&quot; states: for illness characterized by cough and reverse flow, a thin and rapid pulse at the cun position indicates lung abscess. When cough and breath reversal occur, with frequent expectoration of turbid phlegm and an inability to lie down and sleep, use the Zao Jia Wan. If the cough causes breath reversal with a sound like waterfowl in the throat, the She Gan Ma Huang Tang should be employed. These three cases all involve cough and breath reversal; how can we solely categorize cough and reverse flow as hiccups? Currently, while practitioners of Shang Han may consider hiccups, the sections on the six meridians and whether to induce sweating or purging do not mention it, indicating it may have been neglected in the writings. Although hiccups are not discussed in the six meridians section or related sections, one cannot equate cough with breath reversal to hiccups, nor can they conflate cough and breath reversal with hiccups. Some say: you claim that the &quot;Yao Lue&quot; depicts reverse flow not as hiccups; why, then, do later practitioners treat hiccups using Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction and achieve recoveries? I respond: Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction is a formula that is spicy and sweet, having both dispersing and soothing properties, as well as harmonizing and nourishing effects. Despite the differing symptoms, the cause remains the same—an imbalance of pathogenic and righteous qi leading to turmoil. Thus, it can be effectively used for both. Nonetheless, treating two conditions with the same medicine is acceptable, but viewing them as one entity is not.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong><br><strong>Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>Belching is a reverse reaction, where the qi surges upward from below the navel and escapes through the mouth, making a sound. The Book states: &quot;Fire rises.&quot; The Inner Canon says: &quot;All reverse movements that surge upward belong to fire.&quot; Dongyuan argues that fire cannot coexist with the original qi, asserting that fire is a thief of the original qi. Ancient prescriptions always described this condition as a weakness of the stomach without addressing the fire, and treated it with remedies such as clove, persimmon stems, bamboo shavings, and dried citrus peel. It remains unclear which truly reduces fire and which compensates for emptiness. </p>
<p>The yin qi of a person depends on the stomach for nourishment. When the stomach is damaged, the wood qi oppresses it, which is a matter of earth being defeated and wood being robbed. The yin is overrun by fire, unable to be contained internally; the wood, led by the fire, thus surges upward through the clear pathway. To say the stomach is weak means the yin is weak; if this weakness is severe, it may appear to be a critical condition. However, one must be mindful of actual deficiencies. </p>
<p>For coughs with belching, weak qi, or yin fire, one should observe whether there is excess or deficiency to treat accordingly. For deficiency, use Ren Shen Bai Zhu Decoction or Major Tonifying Pill; for excess accompanied by phlegm, induce vomiting with Ren Shen and similar herbs. When phlegm has solidified and qi is stagnant, using honey water for vomiting can help; this indicates dryness of phlegm that cannot be expelled.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Phlegm consists of dried tangerine peel and pinellia. For qi deficiency, use ginseng and white atractylodes. For yin fire, use coptis, honeysuckle, and talc. If there is a cough with reversed flow and diarrhea, use talc, licorice, fried coptis, white peony, ginseng, white atractylodes, and dried tangerine peel, along with bamboo roof sap to take. </p>
<p>Coughing and reversal is referred to in ancient times as &quot;he&quot; and more recently as &quot;e,&quot; caused by cold in the stomach, where cold qi rises, making this condition very dangerous. There are also heat-related instances that present as cold damage. If there are other illnesses causing &quot;e,&quot; use one tael of pinellia and half a tael of fresh ginger, decocted in water and taken hot; or add half a qian each of bitter orange and poria to a warming middle decoction, with one qian of pinellia; if ineffective, add ten cloves. </p>
<p>For cough and reversal after vomiting or diarrhea caused by cold in the stomach, use Qianghuo and Aconite Decoction or take ten cloves and ten dried persimmon stalks chopped and decocted in water. For cough and reversal after vomiting or diarrhea due to heat in the stomach, use bamboo peel and bamboo shavings decoction. </p>
<p>If there are no other illnesses and e occurs occasionally, this is due to qi reversal. In such cases, use a small amount of pinellia and poria decoction with bitter orange and pinellia. Alternatively, decoct and steep radish seeds, grind to extract the juice, and mix with wood fragrant to disperse heat, which is particularly effective for reversed qi.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> </p>
<p><strong>By Li Chen (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cold Water Clashing</strong></p>
<p>When one experiences a heaving sensation, it means dry retching, with a voice that is heavier and longer. This occurs due to a blockage of qi in the chest. If the stomach pulse is floating, it indicates a blockage; if slippery, it suggests heaving. Both conditions arise from weakened stomach qi, which may be exacerbated by excessive sweating or drinking cold water. The clash of cold water causes the stomach qi to rise abnormally. To alleviate this, one can use the &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; with added cinnamon and clove to disperse cold and reduce qi. Additionally, Poria and Banxia can help dispel water retention. If the conditions persist, one may consider using &quot;Gui Pi Tang&quot; or &quot;Zhu Ru Tang.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is a blockage due to heat stagnation that obstructs the upward and downward flow of qi, then &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang&quot; with fresh ginger should be included. In severe cases of constipation, the &quot;Xiao Cheng Qi Tang&quot; formula should be used. For soft stools, a selection of &quot;Zhong Shi Tang&quot; is recommended. For warm diseases that cause thirst and result in heaving, &quot;Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang&quot; with added rhizoma of reed should be used. One must always incorporate Banxia to disperse qi stagnation; bamboo leaves help clear the stomach and relieve restlessness; fresh ginger disperses the rising qi. These issues arise from qi reversal, making fresh ginger an essential remedy for vomiting. If there is heat, black plum can be used as a substitute.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Eating Reversed and Naming</p>
<p>It used to be thought that coughing referred to the cough itself, while the common view equated &quot;呃&quot; with the sound made when something is stuck in the throat. According to the study of rhymes by Yu Huaxi, &quot;食戹&quot; is associated with &quot;呃,&quot; which refers to the rising of qi. There is also a definition of &quot;呃&quot; as &quot;哕,&quot; where &quot;哕&quot; produces a sound before inhalation, while &quot;呃&quot; produces a sound after the reverse flow is complete. The processes of inhalation and exhalation differ. For those who experience both vomiting and &quot;哕,&quot; the issue originates from the stomach; for those who do not, it stems from the lungs. When grains enter the stomach, the stomach qi rises to the lungs, leading to a conflict between cold qi and the fresh grain qi, causing it to reverse back to the stomach, resulting in audible &quot;噫噫.&quot; Thus, Danxi emphasized that the fire from the lower abdomen directly surges up to the chest, interacting with the jueyin, causing a clash between water and fire, which produces the sound.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Differentiating Between Yang and Yin Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Yang patterns present with fever, bitter mouth, chest fullness, and a wiry rapid pulse. For such symptoms, prescribe Xiaochaihu Decoction with bamboo shavings; if there is urinary retention, add Poria or use Zhu Ling Decoction. For constipation, use Tiaogui Chengqi Decoction. In cases of Shaoyin patterns with fullness in the lower abdomen and constipation, or if clear water (from food) is regurgitating, prescribe Xiao Chengqi Decoction. In Yangming patterns with fever and thirst, chest fullness, and irritability, indicated by a surging rapid pulse, this may be fire attacking the lungs, for which use Gan Cao Xie Xin Decoction.</p>
<p>Yin patterns characterized by soft stools and gastric coldness, or due to extreme vomiting and diarrhea leading to aversion to cold with a thin pulse, should use Ju Pi Gan Jiang Decoction. For internal cold and cold extremities, use Qiang Huo Fu Zi Decoction or Ding Xiang Shi Di San, and adjust with Su He Xiang Wan. For gastric cold causing drinking water to clash, prescribe Xiao Qinglong Decoction, omitting Ma Huang and adding Fu Zi. For cold hands and feet, use Xiao Ju Pi Decoction. For chest fullness and weakness, use Da Ju Pi Decoction. As a rule, for food regurgitation, all remedies should include Chen Pi, bamboo shavings, and ginger juice. When symptoms arise indicating the need for proper sweating, or if Yin and Yang are rising and falling, recovery is possible; if food accumulates, leading to urinary retention and phlegm-fire rising, abdominal fullness with inability to urinate, and a sinking and faint pulse, it indicates a grim prognosis. The disease fundamentally relates to water qi, with both exterior and interior signs present.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Differentiation of Illness: Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>Deficiency arises from internal injuries to the spleen and stomach or from weakness after a major illness, often presenting with a pale face, cold limbs, and loose stools. Excess is due to external factors causing dryness in the stomach or from great anger and overeating, often presenting with a red face, heat in the limbs, and constipation. Excess can be treated, but deficiency is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Heat from Inefficiency of Yin</strong></p>
<p>Fire is the thief of original Qi. The Yin Qi of a person is nourished by the Stomach Qi. When the stomach is harmed, the wood element invades it, the Yin fire takes advantage, unable to guard internally, and the wood carries the fire upwards, severely worsening deficiency. Those with damp-heat from rich foods can take the Ten Flavor Xiao Chai Hu Decoction along with Dan Huang Bo pills or tune with Yi Yuan Powder. For those with strong stomach fire and good appetite, use Xiao Ban Xia Decoction adding Shan Zhi, Huang Qin to induce vomiting. For excessive fire, add Huang Lian, Huang Bo to Yi Yuan Powder. For those with diarrhea or women postpartum, experiencing reversal from the navel upwards, particularly at night, all belong to Yin deficiency, needing Si Wu Decoction with added Zhi Mu, Bo He, Chen Pi, and Zhu Ru.</p>
<p><strong>Strain and Injury to the Spleen</strong></p>
<p>Severe labor and poverty cause fire to rise and turbidity to ascend, needing Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction or Sheng Mai San with a little Huang Bo and Fu Zi. For those with sexual strain, use Qiong Yu Paste. If kidney Qi does not return to the source, use Jiu Wei An Shen Pills.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Prolonged Illness</strong></p>
<p>Prolonged illness is a dangerous condition. A rapid pulse indicates fire, and if metal is affected, it is likely to be fatal. In cases of prolonged illnesses from cold damage, vomiting, or diarrhea, along with symptoms of hiccups, this indicates fire attempting to ascend, being obstructed by cold pathogens in the stomach. Therefore, it is appropriate to administer a blend of clove and persimmon calyx powder, Qianghuo Fuzi Decoction, or a modified Li Zhong Decoction with increased ginseng. For long-standing cases, use Sanxiang Powder or decoction of papaya root. If there is middle vacuity, stupor, and a knotty pulse, use the honey-fried licorice decoction to rescue.</p>
<p><strong>Food Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>When the stomach is overly full, the pathway of ascension and descent is obstructed. One should use the Er Chen Decoction with added bitter orange peel and sand ginger.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Qi</strong></p>
<p>When phlegm is obstructed above and fire is activated below, without other symptoms, and if hiccups suddenly arise from the chest, one should use the Qinjian Er Chen Decoction, or simply take decoctions of tangerine peel, pinellia, and ginger. Alternatively, ginseng and reed decoction can be used for expulsion. Stagnant phlegm due to anger and heat is also manageable. Ginseng and reed clear the lungs, allowing the lungs to regain function and restoring fire and earth to their proper places. If one is affected by emotional distress, the Mukxiang Yungqi Powder should be used, administered with radish decoction, or the Suzi Jiangqi Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Mismanaged Downward Movement</strong></p>
<p>When the pathways are obstructed, leading to hiccups, cold medicines should be administered. Da Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate. If the pulse is excessively weak and on the verge of collapse, it is necessary to use Liang Ge Powder or Detoxification Decoction to nourish yin and diminish yang; large purgation should be avoided. After sweating, vomiting, and purging, if stomach heat remains, one can take Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with tangerine peel and bamboo shavings, or decoctions of tangerine peel and bamboo shavings, or a single heart-purge decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>When a person eats too quickly, inhales water into the lungs, or laughs excessively, it is considered excess. If there is belching from eating or laughing, one can use paper twists to stimulate the nose for a sneeze, or holding their breath for a long time may stop it. For water-related belching, one may use Xiao Xian(xiong) Tang or Xiao Qing Long Tang without Ma Huang, simply to clear and resolve. Generally, if one has sweated, vomited, or taken too many cooling medications, they should take warming tonics; if there is upward rising of spleen and stomach yin fire, they should take balanced tonics; if there is heat present, cooling tonics are appropriate. &quot;Jufang&quot; usually employs Dingfu to warm and assist the fire, diminishing insufficiencies and benefiting the excess, thus it is likely that belching and counterflow will inevitably lead to death.</p>
<h3>Summary of Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>For cold damage with cough and counterflow, Zhongjing refers to cough counterflow as &quot;yi,&quot; with two types of conditions: yin and yang. The yin condition arises from cold in the stomach. There may also be cases where the initial condition was heat, but excessive sweating later led to vomiting and purging, attacking heat too vigorously, leading to stomach cold. For cough and counterflow due to cold, use dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, or half summer and ginger decoction. For cough and counterflow, add half summer and aged tangerine peel in equal parts to the decoction of platycodon and bitter orange, and boil with ten slices of ginger; this also treats the yin condition of cough and counterflow. The yang condition of cough counterflow results from heat in the stomach, treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang or tangerine peel and bamboo leaf decoction. If the yang condition of cough counterflow also includes abdominal pain, inquire about the location of the discomfort. If it is in the front, use Zhu Ling Tang; if in the back, use Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Tang.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>There are cases where one experiences belching without illness, which is due to the reversal of qi. In severe cases, it may persist for a day or two. It is advisable to use a small amount of Banxia Fuling Decoction, adding Zhi Shi and Banxia, or to use a decoction to soak radish seeds, extract the juice, and adjust with Mu Xiang to regulate the qi, taking it warm, which is best for combating reversed qi. If there is severe cold in the stomach, causing persistent cough and possibly vomiting, and light remedies do not take effect, one should use clove decoction, and add Fuzi and glutinous rice decoction, increasing the amounts of stir-fried Sichuan pepper and cloves to ten each per dose.</p>
<p>When the stomach is full, it leads to belching; when it is deficient, it causes &quot;huò&quot; (a type of prolonged belching). Reversal indicates insufficiency in the stomach and excess heat above the diaphragm. Coughing with reversal is a condition referred to in ancient texts as &quot;huò&quot; and more recently as &quot;è,&quot; stemming from cold in the stomach, causing the cold qi to reverse and lead to belching, which is the most serious symptom. Occasionally, there may be heated belching seen in cases of febrile diseases. If belching occurs due to other illnesses, it still relates to cold, and the remedy should be one liang of Banxia, two halves of fresh ginger, and one bowl of water, decocted to half a bowl and taken hot; alternatively, take ten cloves and ten cut persimmon stems, boiled in half a bowl of white water. If ineffective, one may add an additional ten cloves to a modified Li Zhong Decoction with half a qian of Zhi Ke and Fuling, and one qian of Banxia.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Shāng Hán Liù Shū | Ming Táo Hua</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Evidence and Distinction of Names</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Huò&quot; refers to a severe form of dry heaving, which differs from regular dry heaving in that it is accompanied by sound, is clamorous and prolonged, producing sound without substance. This occurs due to the inherent weakness of the stomach qi, often exacerbated by excessive sweating, drinking too much cold water, or cold water clashing against internal cold, leading to a pathological reversal. Additionally, if heat qi accumulates, obstructing passage up and down, it may also cause &quot;huò&quot;. In mild cases, it can be alleviated with harmonizing and dispersing methods; in severe cases, warming and dispersing measures are needed. If &quot;huò&quot; is accompanied by abdominal fullness and difficulty in defecation, first administer a half summer ginger decoction, then proceed with a small purgative. If urinary output is insufficient, use a pigweed decoction. Should &quot;huò&quot; persist, apply a ginger and tangerine peel decoction. For febrile conditions with heat, if &quot;huò&quot; arises from excessive cold water intake, a rehmannia and kudzu decoction is indicated. If &quot;huò&quot; occurs without urination, it indicates a grave condition.</p>
<p>As for coughing reversely, it is commonly referred to as &quot;è tè&quot; in vernacular. The sound may just begin in the throat and then abruptly stop, resulting in short, consecutive sounds that are fleeting. The ancients distinguished this as &quot;huò&quot;, but that is incorrect. &quot;Huò&quot; is not different from dry heaving; the only distinction is that it produces a prolonged, clamorous sound without substance. When the illness progresses to &quot;huò&quot;, it becomes critical and difficult to treat.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Generally, when there is obstruction in the chest that prevents downward flow, it leads to the expulsion of a rough sound externally. Thus, these two conditions are similar, arising from the original weakness of the stomach qi, excessive sweating, or further drinking of cold water, which clashes with the coldness, resulting in a reversal of the qi. The texts say: when the yang pulse is floating, it indicates obstruction; and when the pulse is slippery, it signifies a rough sound. This is a medical fault, blaming weakness for taking too much from the reality. </p>
<p>There is also the possibility of heat qi being trapped, preventing the qi from circulating properly, which may cause a rough sound. For mild cases, harmonizing and promoting circulation may suffice; for severe cases, warmth and dispersion are necessary. </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, there is no urination and the abdomen is distended, accompanied by a rough sound, and if there is a scattered pulse without coherence, even a divine physician may not be able to intervene effectively; this condition differs from that of cold damage with a rough sound and reversed qi. If one incorrectly attributes rough sounds and coughing to reversed qi, it would lead to great mistakes. Therefore, it is important to distinguish clearly when encountering illness.</p>
<p>In cases with reversed coughing and little bowel movement, one should use the major purging decoction. This is due to heat qi colliding with the spleen and lungs. If the stool is soft, one would use the heart-purging decoction to combat the reversal of stomach qi. If the pulse is scattered, it should not be treated. For reversed coughing with mild fever, one can use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with tangerine peel and fresh ginger. </p>
<p>In instances of cold damage, there may be excessive sweating or indulgence in cold water, leading to the clash of coldness and the rough, unpleasant, prolonged sound known as a rough sound, which is not the same as dry heaving. For mild cases, harmonizing and promoting circulation may suffice; for severe cases, warmth and dispersion are necessary.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Xu Chunfu)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Distinctions in Symptoms</strong>  </p>
<p>Coughing and reverse cough signify a progressive dry cough, characterized by sound without phlegm, continuous and unending. The energy rises from the lower abdomen and ascends, exiting through the throat, as if struck and causing the reverse effect. There are also instances where the cough emits from the throat, followed by a sound that draws back into the throat, which is what constitutes the reverse cough symptom. Hiccups refer to a sound entering the throat. If there are both coughing and hiccuping sounds striking forth, persistent and in the tens of thousands without cessation, and medication proves ineffective, then the method of inducing vomiting should be employed to expel phlegm and saliva immediately. Hiccups, on the other hand, produce a sound exiting, and the sound ceases before inhalation; the root of this occurs in the stomach, elaborated upon in discussions of vomiting, thus will not be revisited here. Hiccups are characterized by an inward sound, where the energy reverses into the throat, and the sound ceases before exhalation; the root of this lies in the lungs, and their inhalation and exhalation differ greatly, making them easy to distinguish.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Coughing and Reflux Belong to Heat</p>
<p>The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: Coughing and reflux refer to what Zhong Jing called regurgitation. Regurgitation arises from stomach cold. When a febrile disease is fundamentally deficient, attacking its heat will inevitably lead to regurgitation. It also mentions that after severe vomiting and purging in a febrile disease, if one subsequently sweats profusely, regurgitation arises because of the deficiency and coldness of stomach qi. Therefore, one should use remedies such as dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, Qianghuo and Aconite decoction, Banxia and ginger decoction, or the Retreating Yin powder. These are Zhong Jing&#39;s methods for treating regurgitation. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; mistakenly equates cough and reflux, thus treating heat as if it were cold. Zhong Jing&#39;s discussion of regurgitation does not imply it is the same as coughing and reflux; the former arises from cold while the latter comes from heat. Since the &quot;Book of Living&quot; regards coughing and reflux as the same, how can one not use heating medicines? The differentiation of syndromes is critical; thus, the choice of remedies must be precise. If it were not for Dongyuan&#39;s diligent clarification of these errors, how would subsequent scholars come to understand this?<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The Illness Must Be Distinguished Between Root and Branch</p>
<p>Dong Yuan said: In the &quot;Living Human Book,&quot; cough and reverse flow are considered a type of belching, suggesting that if it can be treated with purgatives, it is advisable to use the Gui Cheng Qi Decoction. This is because the evil qi resides in the stomach, thus it is identified as belching, which is indeed the case. However, one should not forget that cough and reverse flow indicate that the Yangming has lost its downward transmission to the Taiyin. The &quot;Living Human Book&quot; discusses the root of fire but does not address its branch; it mentions that fire rises to an extreme height leading to cough and reverse flow. Viewed together, belching and cough are manifestations of the same heat. Specifically, belching pertains to the root, associated with the gallbladder, stomach, and the middle; whereas cough pertains to the branch, associated with the heart, lungs, and the upper. If the branch is evident above, then it is rightfully called a branch and does not need to be termed belching. If it is not indicated that it is belching, later generations might only notice the gallbladder and stomach as the root, neglecting the heart and lung as the branch.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The treatment should reduce internal heat and harmonize the Qi.</p>
<p>Coughing with a reverse flow often holds characteristics of coldness in ancient formulas. Therefore, ingredients such as clove, persimmon stem, ginger, and warming medicines are used, although this may be one-sided. Coughing with a reverse flow can be due to deficiency, excess, or heat. When the Qi forcefully rises from below to create sound, what else could it be? Generally, in cases of epidemic fevers, after sweating, vomiting, and purging, overusing cooling medications may lead to weak and cold stomach Qi. This could also occur. In such instances, one must use warming tonics, and not heat-inducing medicines. </p>
<p>Aside from this, if it occurs after an illness, it is often due to prolonged heat when sweating was not adequately achieved, causing enduring heat stagnation, leading to Yin deficiency. If one sweats and purges at the wrong time, it results in excessive heat, so even after the fever has subsided, there can still be heat lurking in the Yin, rising in combination with weak stomach Qi, creating a sound that results in cough (food stagnation) symptoms. Ingredients such as bamboo shavings, ophiopogon, and orange peel can help alleviate constipation with purgative decoctions.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Method of Inducing Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For those who bear repressed anger and are unable to act on their will, many exhibit symptoms of coughing and rebellion. The remedy involves clearing heat, purging phlegm, and soothing qi; if this proves ineffective, it is essential to induce vomiting. This can be done using a decoction of ginseng and reed, with a small amount of salt, which should be consumed. After a little while, inducing vomiting will expel the thick phlegm and saliva, and the cough will cease.</p>
<p>In cases where there is a substantial condition caused by an external cold leading to a lack of downward movement, resulting in constipation and cough, it is urgent to use cold medicines for purging. If the issue arises from excessive food intake, from phlegm or fluid stagnation, or due to violent anger and qi rebellion, it is all considered a substantial condition. In such cases, the combination of gentle purging methods, especially using ginseng and reed, is particularly effective. </p>
<p>Cough and rebellion must be assessed for excess or deficiency. For instance, Danxi treated an elderly man who developed cough after constipation with ginseng and atractylodes decoction, along with a major supplement pill, and he recovered. Similarly, he treated a woman who experienced food-related issues after becoming angry by inducing vomiting with ginseng and reed, which resulted in her recovery.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Erni, which is referred to as &quot;he&quot; in the “Inner Canon,” has varying interpretations. Some say Cheng Wujia and Xu Xueshi consider “he” to be erni, while Dongyuan and Haizang regard it as dry retching, and Chen Wuze names it coughing reverse. There are different opinions among scholars; why do you alone adopt the views of Cheng and Xu? The meaning of “he” is clearly stated in the “Inner Canon,” but various schools overlook this. According to the end of the miscellaneous diseases chapter in the “Spiritual Pivot,” “he” is merely caused by a tickling sensation in the nose, leading to sneezing; there are methods that can suddenly stop it. Similarly, if one is startled, it can also be alleviated. Examining these three methods from the text reveals that they are indeed treatments for erni. </p>
<p>For erni, pricking the nose with a piece of paper leads to sneezing, and the sneezing will immediately stop the erni; another method is to close the mouth and restrict the breathing to stop it; or one can use a great shock from a thief or robber to achieve the same result. This is why I adopt the interpretation of “he” as erni by Cheng and Xu, for it aligns with the essence of the text. If one considers “he” as dry retching, could dry retching be stopped by sneezing, holding one’s breath, or being startled? It is clear that “he” is not dry retching! </p>
<p>As for the interpretation of “he” as coughing reverse, according to the “Inner Canon,” it states: &quot;In autumn, damage from dampness causes upward rebellion and coughing.&quot; The theory of yin and yang correspondence also indicates: &quot;In autumn, damage from dampness leads to coughing in winter.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>In this discussion, it is clear that &quot;ke ni&quot; refers to coughing, as evident from its comparison throughout the three seasons of spring, summer, and winter. The Daoist Master Sun said in &quot;Qianjin&quot;: &quot;Ke ni&quot; is certainly a cough. This is self-evident, but later generations have mistakenly interpreted &quot;ke ni&quot; as &quot;e ni,&quot; which is a significant error. </p>
<p>Liu Zonghou mentioned: The symptom of &quot;e ni&quot; can be either due to deficiency or excess, and can involve heat, phlegm, or water qi; it should not be exclusively categorized under cold conditions. For instance, after sweating, vomiting, or purging due to a cold, and in cases of prolonged diarrhea or after a serious illness, or postpartum conditions in women, such symptoms arise from severe deficiency of the spleen and stomach qi and blood. </p>
<p>If a healthy person eats too quickly, causing qi to get stuck, or if they drink water and laugh, leading to choking, or if phlegm-water obstructs the heart, or if anger causes qi to rebel and phlegm to ascend, or if it occurs post-illness due to heat without proper purging, all these are classified as excess conditions. Water is moist and descendent, while fire is hot and ascendant; if the qi is pushing upward from below, what else could it be but fire? Generally, the treatment for deficiency is to tonify it, but within deficiency, one must differentiate between cold and heat. If due to excessive consumption of cold after sweating, vomiting, or purging, it should be treated with warming tonics; if due to deficiency-heat from the spleen and stomach, it should be treated with harmonizing tonics; if heat is present, cool and tonify. </p>
<p>In contrast, conditions like excess from cold in cases of illness leading to &quot;e ni&quot; necessitate cooling and purging. Similarly, when phlegm-water stagnates, or if overwhelming anger leads to rebellious qi and phlegm, these symptoms must be characterized by substantial excess qi, with no other adverse signs. The treatment should target the location of the pathogenic qi by inducing, purging, clearing, or draining as needed.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;reversal of qi&quot; did not exist in ancient texts; in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it was originally called &quot;hiccup,&quot; named for the repeated sound it produces, hence it is now referred to as reversal of qi, which is also appropriate in meaning. Observing the methods to treat hiccups in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; one uses herbs to stimulate the nose to induce sneezing, or applies techniques like breath manipulation and shock, which are all remedies for hiccups. This hiccup is fundamentally the reversal of qi, and there is no need for further distinction. </p>
<p>Master Sun stated: Amidst the extensive search for methods, no similar name was found, thus he equated &quot;coughing and reversal&quot; with hiccups. This led to subsequent generations misinterpreting and confusing &quot;coughing,&quot; &quot;dry heaving,&quot; and &quot;belching&quot; since the Tang Dynasty. Such terminologies must be examined and corrected. </p>
<p>The term &quot;coughing and reversal&quot; originally comes from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; where it refers to the phenomenon of coughing accompanied by reversed qi. For instance, in the &quot;Great Treatise on Changes,&quot; it states that when the metal element (autumn) is excessive, it can lead to coughing and reversed qi. This indicates that coughing results in reversed qi, thus it is called &quot;reversed qi.&quot; It also mentions: &quot;When coughing and reversal worsen, blood may overflow.&quot;<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>It is common for a condition where persistent cough and reverse flow of qi lead to blood, but it has not been heard of that coughing with reverse flow results in blood. Just as the Great Discussion on the Six Origins states: when there is metal distress, people suffering from cough with reverse flow relates to this notion. It is also clear that this cough is not the same as the reverse flow of qi. However, in later generations, some officials have defined reverse flow only as a type of cough, which shows they have not thoroughly examined the matter. </p>
<p>Observing the words of Danxi, in &quot;Essentials Compilation,&quot; it is stated: Master Sun mistakenly identified reverse flow as a cough, indicating that reverse flow is not cough. In the &quot;Heart Methods Appendix,&quot; it is stated: cough with reverse flow means the ancient term was &quot;哕&quot; (huè), a recent term being &quot;呃&quot; (è), suggesting again that &quot;哕&quot; is indeed cough with reverse flow. The section on vomiting states: if there is sound and material, it is called vomiting; if there is sound without material, it is called &quot;哕.&quot; Thus, dry heaving is also categorized as &quot;哕.&quot; The inconsistencies here are quite mistaken! Furthermore, some officials from Haizang and Hejian view &quot;哕&quot; as dry heaving while considering cough with reverse flow as &quot;噫&quot; (yī), which is all erroneous.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The act of nausea can be categorized into two types: when one vomits without any material, it is called &quot;nausea,&quot; and when one vomits with material, it is called &quot;vomiting.&quot; The condition of abdominal distension and belching is referred to as &quot;regurgitating,&quot; while the upward movement of qi from below is also called &quot;regurgitating.&quot; These four terms have distinct meanings and proper names; can they be confused in this way? Therefore, I analyze and clarify them: belching refers to the regurgitation of food, not a cough reflex. A severe cough reflex is referred to as a strong cough, not regurgitation. Dry heaving is empty vomiting, which is nausea, not belching. Regurgitating refers to the breath after a full meal, which is warm qi, not a cough reflex. If later generations take this as a guide, then the doubts arising from differing opinions can be resolved. The symptoms of regurgitation can be associated with typhoid fever or other mixed conditions; in ancient texts, they were all regarded as manifestations of cold deficiency. However, Danxi cites the Neijing, stating that all regurgitations that rise upward belong to fire. When patients exhibit this, it may seem like a critical condition. Yet, there are also cases of true excess that should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>I once saw this statement and doubted that it contradicted ancient thinkers, thinking it incorrect, as I believed this evidence must pertain to the condition of coldness and not to actual heat. However, with my experiences in later years, I gained a definitive understanding and realized that Danxi&#39;s words were indeed not false. Although the distinctions between cold and heat, void and substance vary, the fundamental cause of a cough is always due to reversed Qi. When Qi is reversed from below, it rushes upward; without Qi, there is no cough, and without Yang, there is also no cough. Thus, the cause must be related to Qi. If one wishes to understand its manifestations, do we not witness thunder in the rain or splashing in the water? For Yang is obscured by Yin, giving rise to thunder, which roars unceasingly; this fire is the origin of thunder, and fire is precisely Qi. Similarly, Qi is concealed by water, giving rise to splashing, which flows continuously; this Qi is the origin of splashing, and Qi is indeed Yang. However, when the illness resides in the Qi aspect, it is not just one side; the primary causes of coughing are merely three: first, cold; second, heat; and third, deficiency and collapse. A cough from cold can be warmed or dispersed, and once the cold leaves, the Qi will naturally ease. A cough from heat can be lowered or cleared, and when the fire calms, the Qi will stabilize. Yet a cough arising from deficiency and collapse is indeed a perilous sign, and those who escape from it are exceedingly fortunate.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p>
<h3>On Cough</h3>
<p>In cases of mixed symptoms of hiccup, although they arise from reversed qi, there are those with a combination of cold, those with a combination of heat, those due to food stagnation causing reversal, those due to qi stagnation causing reversal, those due to deficiency of the middle qi causing reversal, and those due to depletion of yin qi causing reversal. However, by observing the causes and treating the qi, there will be no cases that cannot be cured. If hiccups are mild or occur occasionally, and the qi is flowing smoothly, there is no need for treatment. Only when hiccups are frequent or severe must one consider that the qi is greatly reversed, or there is significant depletion of the spleen and kidney&#39;s vital energy. </p>
<p>Actual patterns of symptoms are not difficult to treat, but depletion of the vital energy is the most dangerous condition. When cold stagnation causes hiccups, it might be due to wind-cold, consumption of raw or cold foods, or the inherent cold nature of the internal organs that occasionally leads to reversal. In such cases, removing the obstruction and suppressing the cold will stop the hiccup. Suitable remedies include tangerine peel soup, San Yin clove powder, or Er Chen decoction with five to seven slices of fresh ginger, or combined with other formulas such as Guanjian decoction or licorice and dried ginger soup, or tangerine peel and dried ginger soup. When the cold is severe, use Jiangshui powder or Si Ni decoction.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Stomach fire causes hiccups, and its symptoms are quite numerous. However, upon examining the pulse, if it is slippery and solid while the body is not deficient in energy, and there is stagnation in the chest and diaphragm, or if the stools are hard or do not pass, it indicates that there is fire in the stomach, which causes the hiccups. By reducing this fire, the hiccups will naturally stop, and using “An Wei Drink” is most effective. I have cured many people with these symptoms.</p>
<p>For hiccups accompanied by bloating due to qi counterflow, it is advisable to use a modified Er Chen Decoction with added Wu Yao, or Baoguan Dingxiang Shidi Powder, or Qiang Huo Fu Zi Decoction, or Shen Xiang Powder.</p>
<p>If hiccups are caused by food stagnation, one should use a modified Er Chen Decoction with added Hawthorn, White Mustard Seed, and Wu Yao, or employ Da He Zhong Drink with added Dried Ginger and Mu Xiang.</p>
<p>For those with deficiency cold in the middle burner (spleen and stomach) and hiccups caused by qi counterflow, one should use a modified Li Zhong Decoction with added Dingxiang, or Warm Stomach Drink with Dingxiang. If hiccups are a result of internal injury from overwork and fatigue, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Dingxiang. Generally, severe cold in the middle burner stems from deficiency in spleen and stomach qi. If the spleen and stomach are not deficient, then the cold will not be severe; hence, when treating cold, the focus should be on spleen qi. If there is no heat present, ingredients like Fresh Ginger, Ban Xia, Dingxiang, Shidi, Bai Zhu, and Cinnamon can be used.</p>
<p>After vomiting or purging when the stomach qi is slightly deficient, or if hiccups are accompanied by heat in the diaphragm, one should use Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction suitably. </p>
<p>For deficiency cold in the lower burner, the liver and kidney’s ability to produce vital energy is impaired, hence hiccups are commonly seen in weak individuals due to insufficient original yang, which is easily suppressed.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>The root of this nausea mainly lies in the kidneys; therefore, I formulate the Guiqi Decoction to address it, which is quite effective. Some use the Li Yin Decoction with added clove to disperse the qi, and it is also excellent. </p>
<p>In cases following severe illness, or those who are extremely thin and weak, or who suffer from weakness due to overexertion leading to nausea, this is the most critical condition. If the deficiency within is noted, one should promptly nourish the spleen; if it is a deficiency of yin, one should promptly nourish the kidneys. The first two methods are indeed firm, yet if there is still concern, then one should resort to great tonifying formulas like the Yuan Decoction and the You Gui Decoction, which may be the best options.</p>
<p>In cases of nausea, if the voice is strong and the energy is robust with a slippery and full pulse, one generally should clear it down; if the voice is small and the breath slight with a weak pulse, one generally should warm and tonify. </p>
<p>For nausea due to exterior cold, it ultimately is another manifestation of qi counterflow, which may differ from mixed conditions, as mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing regarding its categories. However, if there are still things unclarified or treatments insufficient, I will briefly mention them as follows.</p>
<p>In cases of cold in the stomach due to external cold, conditions are generally similar to the previous mixed conditions and should be treated as mentioned before with warming and middle-regulating remedies. If the stomach is cold and drinking water leads to nausea, then it should be treated according to Zhang Zhongjing’s methods. If the pathogen resides in the exterior, it has no relation to the interior, thus there is no nausea.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>If the evil of lesser yang is located between the half exterior and half interior, resulting in alternating chills and fever along with qi being hindered leading to hiccups, it can be treated with Chai-Chen decoction. If accompanied by cold, add cloves; if with heat, add Huangqin; or Xiao-Chai-Hu decoction may also be appropriate. </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage causing downward obstruction, if the evil enters the upright yangming and internal heat reaches its extreme, with the three burners dried up, the vaginal discharge ceased, and hiccups arising due to upward qi rebellion, it is essential to clear the heat and remove the obstruction, so that the rebellious qi can descend and thus alleviate the hiccups. However, it is crucial to carefully assess the severity of the evil: if there are no solid distension symptoms, only dryness and heat, then Bai-Hu decoction or Zhu-ye-Shi-Gao decoction, or Xie-Xin decoction to cool and resolve should be used; if there is indeed dry feces constipation and solid distension, then San-Cheng-Qi decoction should be administered.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage where the evil has not yet dispersed, using too much warming and tonifying treatments can cause the middle burner qi to rebel, which can especially lead to hiccups; in such cases, Anwei drink is the best remedy. If there is rebellious qi without fire, then use Ju-Pi decoction; if there is simultaneous exterior evil unresolved, then Chai-Chen decoction is appropriate.</p>
<p>In situations where cold damage is mistakenly attacked, whether by vomiting, purging, or wrongly using cold cooling methods, leading to severe deficiency and cold of the spleen, kidneys, and stomach, which causes hiccups, it becomes a critical condition. Immediate adjustment using methods that warm the stomach and regulate yin is needed, for delay may render the situation irreparable.</p>
<p>Observing Zhang Zihe&#39;s method of vomiting can also treat hiccups, as it can allow the qi to extend and disperse when it is stagnant. Therefore, for cases of fullness and stagnation, Zhang Zihe&#39;s method is indeed applicable.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Secret Method of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo, Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment Method</strong>  </p>
<p>When the qi is disturbed and cannot rise, it is in a state of stagnation. If the qi can rise and spread freely, but is instead suppressed and unable to ascend, there will inevitably be signs of rebellious qi, requiring the use of medicine to promote its upward movement, allowing the qi to spread and expand. </p>
<p>The prescription includes three qian each of Dang Gui, Bai Shao, Huang Qi, and Bai Zhu, five qian of Shu Di, and one qian each of Ren Shen, Fu Ling, and Chuan Xiong, along with five fen each of Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, to be decocted in water for consumption. This is the Eight Treasure Decoction, effective for balancing blood and qi. If licorice is used instead of Huang Qi, it no longer qualifies as the Eight Treasure Decoction. </p>
<p>Once the balance of qi and blood is achieved without any deviation, one can then use Sheng Ma and Chai Hu to help it rise, promoting the flow of blood and qi, thus eliminating any signs of rebellious qi. If only the yang is supplemented without the yin, the yang will flourish while the yin will decline; conversely, if only the yin is supplemented without the yang, the yin will prosper while the yang will diminish.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Therefore, it is necessary to supplement it comprehensively. Initially, this is beneficial, and it should not be viewed alongside the dispersed kinds. When water qi overwhelms the heart protector&#39;s network, there is persistent belching, which is a sign of impending death. However, I believe it can be salvaged because the heart protector is overwhelmed by water qi, and there is concern about the heart being harmed. Therefore, persistent belching occurs because it seeks to summon the qi of the five organs to jointly rescue the heart threatened by water qi. As water qi overwhelms the heart protector, leading to belching symptoms, it is essential to merely disperse the dampness of water qi, and the belching will cease naturally.</p>
<p>To stop belching, use the following decoction: one tael each of Poria and Job&#39;s tears; three qian each of Atractylodes, White Atractylodes, and Ginseng; five qian of Foxnut; one qian each of Pinellia and dried tangerine peel; five fen of Clove; and three fen of the fruit of Evodia. Boil in water and take the decoction. After one dose, belching will stop; after two doses, it will be cured. This formula strengthens the stomach and solidifies the spleen. Although it promotes the excretion of dampness and water, it does not deplete true qi; thus, it can supplement the heart protector and strengthen the position of the heart ruler without needing to treat belching—belching will resolve itself.</p>

<p>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: The Yellow Emperor asked: What qi causes belching in a person? Qibo replied: Food enters the stomach, and the stomach qi rises to the lungs. Now, if cold qi and new grain qi both enter the stomach together, they disturb each other, the true and the evil qi attack each other, and the qi reverses and exits the stomach, thus causing belching. Strengthen the hand taiyin and drain the foot shaoyin. The lung is responsible for belching; therefore, treat with hand taiyin and foot shaoyin.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: Mental distress, cold and heat in the guest, frequent hiccups, and strains the Heart of the Palace.

<p>The &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; states: Shaohai governs reversed Qi during breathing, belching, and vomiting. Wenliu governs cold and heat injuries, headache with hiccups and nosebleeds, and inability to lift the shoulders. </p>
<p>Another method: Moxibustion on Chengjiang, seven times with moxa the size of wheat grains. </p>

<p>For heat disorders in the stomach with frequent hiccups, moxibustion on Sanli, thirty times; the point is three inches below the knee. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ji Sheng Fang&quot; states: For hiccups and reversal, the method is: for women, press the nipple downward to the bone&#39;s end, which is the point; for men or women with small breasts, take one finger&#39;s width as a reference, men on the left, women on the right, the point is between the breasts near the pulsating artery, moxa the size of a small bean, three times. </p>
<p>The &quot;Wei Sheng Bao Jian&quot; states: For all persistent hiccups, men on the left, women on the right, at the dark point beneath the breast, about the size of a chive leaf, moxa three times; for severe cases, moxa twenty-one times. </p>
<p>The &quot;Gu Jin Yi Tong&quot; states: Hiccups, moxa at Shanzhong, Zhongwan, Qihai, and Sanli. </p>

<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A woman presented with a heavy head and strong heat, a flushed face, alternating chills and fevers, dry heaving and coughing, pain in the chest and ribs, difficulty turning over, tinnitus, and loss of appetite. Initially, a purgative was administered, followed by a modified Yiyuan San with Qingdai and mint powder in two to three doses, resulting in reduced symptoms. A physician diagnosed that this illness often makes one want to cry to feel relief. The woman confirmed this, stating it happens frequently but she did not understand why. The physician explained that the Shaoyang fire was attacking the Lung metal, which was weakened by the fire, causing a lack of expression. Since the Lung governs sorrow, this led to the urge to cry for relief. Adding Guizhao Huanglian Jiedu Decoction in several doses resulted in complete recovery. </p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Xinfah&quot; states: A girl beyond the age of marriage had a disposition of restlessness and likened rich tastes. During the hot months, she became extremely angry, leading to coughing and a convulsive body, with a pulse that was difficult to diagnose, and she appeared dazed with both her form and energy being substantial. It was determined that phlegm was present above the diaphragm, anger was repressed, and the heat from phlegm clashed, obstructing the qi from descending, making vomiting necessary. A decoction of ginseng and reed was prescribed, resulting in a significant expulsion of stubborn phlegm through several bowls and a day of deep sleep thereafter. Ginseng enters the Taiyin channel, replenishing the Yang within the Yin; whereas reed does the opposite, strongly draining the Yang of Taiyin. The girl&#39;s violent anger raised her qi; the Liver governs anger, the Lung governs qi, and with anger, the qi rebels. The wooden Liver overcomes the Lung&#39;s metal, leading to coughing and confusion. The combination of ginseng and reed effectively promotes vomiting, resolving phlegm and allowing the qi to descend, extinguishing the fire, restoring the metal qi, and harmonizing the stomach qi, bringing relief.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Zhao Litong, nearing fifty, was of weak constitution and often angry. In July, during a scorching heat, he suffered from severe hunger while requesting food at home, but as it couldn&#39;t be prepared quickly, he became very angry. Two days later, he developed retention issues and experienced thirst. He believed that mixing cold water with honey would quench his thirst quickly, and his retention gradually eased. After five to seven days, he summoned me. Upon checking, his pulse was slightly strong but not rapid, so I instructed him to stop the honey water. When thirsty, he was to take a decoction of ginseng and white atractylodes mixed with Yiyuan powder, and the retention continued to gradually improve. A week later, he felt very fatigued and began to burp. I recognized this was due to his prolonged retention leading to kidney deficiency, so I advised him to stick with the previous medication. However, the retention had not stopped yet, and he continued with the honey drink. After three days of this, the burping had not ceased. Others believed that the medicine was inappropriate and intended to add ginger to the drink. I said: “Tonifying medicines do not produce immediate effects, and aconite does not tonify the kidneys; taking it would surely be fatal.” They asked: “Could it be because of drinking too much cold water, leading to coldness?” I replied: “Under such sultry heat, drinking something cool is not cold; don’t doubt this too much. Wait a few days; the medicinal properties will take effect, and it will resolve itself.” Four days later, the burping stopped, and the retention was also stable.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Chen Zerens was nearly seventy years old, a person with a robust appetite, but he had a chronic cough that disturbed him intermittently. In the early autumn, he suffered from stagnation and reduced his food intake, leading to belching after five or seven days. He summoned me to examine him; his pulse was forceful and wide, which others deemed serious. I said, &quot;Those who are thin can still be treated.&quot; I prescribed a large tonic pill made with ginseng and white atractylodes to replenish his blood, and after seven days, he was stable.</p>
<p>Zhou Yue, who was over twenty years younger than Chen, developed a belching condition after running several miles following a heavy meal. He belched over a hundred times without stopping for half a day; drinking alcohol and soup did not trigger any belching. By evening, he developed a fever, and this lasted for two months. His pulse was thin and weak, so I treated him by nourishing the blood and pushing it into the qi using a modified Tao Ren Chengqi Decoction, which helped him discharge dark blood numerous times and alleviate his symptoms. Then, I used a Qi-regulating pill with muskmallow, and combined it with clove. After ten days, he recovered.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>At the age of twenty-six, Lady Hong was obstructed by her superiors due to matters in the summer months. She harbored pent-up anger that could not be released. Soon after, she bathed in water that was too hot to approach, which exacerbated her anger, causing her to feel faint and collapse. She covered herself with her clothes and went to her room. Shortly after, she began to cough violently; each cough made her body jolt, leading to further dizziness. This occurred every three to five breaths, and her pulse could not be diagnosed. I said: &quot;There is phlegm in the upper part of the body, and the anger has caused it to be stagnant. The hot phlegm is clashing, preventing qi from descending, so it must be expelled.&quot; At that time, it was midnight, and suddenly, someone happened to have two taels of ginseng and reed available. A concentrated decoction was made, resulting in her expelling about two sheng of thick phlegm, sweating profusely, and after half the night of being exhausted, she found peace.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Correct Transmission of Medicine,&quot; it states: The son of the Li family from Dongyang suffered from a yangming interior excess due to febrile disease. The physician treated him with tonic herbs, leading to a paroxysm of vomiting. Ten days later, he called me to diagnose his pulse, which was long, strong, and big. I administered the Da Chengqi Decoction to purge him significantly; the fever subsided and his vomiting also ceased.</p>
<p>The son of the Zhou family from Pansong presented with symptoms of febrile disease. After seven days, the fever subsided but he continued to vomit repeatedly, causing distress to the family. They summoned me to diagnose his pulse, which showed all six pulses were deep, thin, and weak, and he was very fatigued. I prescribed a large dose of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding one qian of fried Fuzi, with three doses a day, along with moxibustion on three points: Rugen and Qihai. That same day, his vomiting ceased, and his pulse became fuller and stable.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The &quot;Six Essentials of Medical Principles&quot; states: A senior experienced internal injuries from diet, and although digestion had not decreased, one person mistakenly took two doses of a laxative pill, leading to worsening abdominal distension and pain; another person took two doses of a purgative, resulting in incessant coughing. They were treated with large doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, up to five applications, and through tonification, recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; mentions: My elder brother had recurring diarrhea for nine months, with over fifty bowel movements each night, vomiting food, and after five or six days became increasingly nauseous. I gave him a grain of clove to dissolve, which immediately stopped the nausea, but after a while, it returned. Therefore, I used the Huang Lian Xie Xin Decoction with added bamboo shavings to drink; although nausea lessened, the diarrhea remained unresolved. This persisted for over ten days, and so I used a small amount of polished rice husks to help absorb the excess fluid and during the day, I supplemented with white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel to nourish his deficiency. After taking the polished rice husks, the nausea gradually subsided, and the diarrhea also stabilized.</p>
<p>There was a patient recovering from a cold who suddenly developed nausea. I tried nearly all remedies for nausea known to ancient practitioners, but none worked. Out of desperation, I used powdered soap pod to blow into the nose, leading to a sneeze that stopped the nausea; however, it returned after a while, so I repeated the use of powdered soap pod, resulting in multiple sneezes that alleviated it for hundreds of times. Each sneeze led to increasing phlegm and mucus, which gradually cleared the nausea, and within two to three days, it stopped. This is a method that aligns with the principles of acupuncture and nasal sneezing, thus I record it here.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Yiqimen (The Door of Breath)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi Suwen (The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Simple Questions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Final Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyin condition manifests as abdominal distention, leading to difficulty in breathing, along with frequent belching and vomiting. 【Note: The foot Taiyin channel enters the abdomen corresponding to the spleen, thus causing abdominal distention. The hand Taiyin channel affects the diaphragm and is related to the lungs, hence the difficulty in breathing. When distention occurs, elevation and descent are challenging; when breathing is restricted, qi pathways are obstructed, resulting in belching and vomiting.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>In the case of heart obstruction, the pulse does not flow smoothly, causing agitation that leads to a sensation of fullness below the heart, sudden upward rising qi, and dry throat with frequent belching. 【Note: When pathogenic factors obscure below the heart, it stirs and affects the heart, causing agitation; hence, agitation leads to fullness below the heart. Reversed qi suddenly rises, resulting in wheezing and a dry throat. The heart governs belching, and when heart qi reverses and exits, it leads to frequent belching.】</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Explanation Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyin condition, which is said to ascend to the heart as belching, arises from the abundance of yin that ascends to Yangming; since Yangming is linked to the heart, it is thus called ascending to the heart as belching. 【Note: Belching refers to the expulsion of qi. The qi of Taiyin ascends from Yangming and exits through the heart, resulting in belching.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Needle Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>Needling the center of the heart leads to death in one day, causing a reaction of belching. 【Note: When the heart is obstructed, it leads to belching; thus, if belching occurs, heart qi is exhausted.】</p>
<p><strong>Lingshu (The Spiritual Pivot)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Channels and Vessels Chapter</strong><a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>The spleen&#39;s channel of the foot Taiyin manifests in several ways: when disturbed, it leads to a strong feeling in the root of the tongue, vomiting after eating, stomach pain, and abdominal bloating with frequent belching. </p>
<p>Note: The spleen, when in motion, affects Qi, which then influences the channels and organs, resulting in symptoms like a strong tongue, vomiting, pain, and bloating. Frequent belching indicates that spleen Qi is rising towards the heart. </p>
<p>The heart governs belching. </p>
<p>Note: Belching is the reverse Qi of the middle burner rising to the heart. </p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), the question arises: what does &quot;exhaustion of the upper jiao&quot; with belching mean? The master replies: the upper jiao receives Qi from the middle burner; if it is not harmonized, it cannot digest food, hence the belching. Exhaustion of the lower jiao results in loss of urine and stool, as Qi is unregulated and cannot be controlled. No treatment is necessary; it will resolve with time.</p>
<p>In treating belching, if there is heat and phlegm in the stomach, one should not take soft gypsum pills. Regarding the prescription, it states that belching with sour regurgitation is due to food stagnation combined with heat; this is related to the rising fire Qi. Use Huangqin as the main ingredient, and add Nanshen, Banxia, and Chenpi as assistants; if there is more heat, add Qingdai.</p>
<p>When phlegm-heat is present, with stagnant fire in the stomach and thick phlegm in the diaphragm due to dietary accumulation, it is necessary to expel phlegm-heat, using pills such as Runxia Wan and Guyu Lian Wan. </p>
<p>Treatment should distinguish between deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Excessive qi leads to belching, which increases after eating; when the rancid qi is strong, it can cause more belching. This is often due to the harmful effects of dampness and heat from food. For treatment, use Erchen Decoction with added Cangzhu, Shenqu, Malt, stir-fried Huanglian, or Baohe Pills. If persistent belching is not related to diet, it is due to deficiency, caused by stagnant turbid qi in the stomach and damp phlegm in the diaphragm, both of which can lead to belching. For this, administer Liu Junzi Decoction with Chenxiang as the chief ingredient, Houpu and Suzi as officials, and Wuyu as a messenger; also consider Qinigunqi Pill or Suhexiang Pill; for severe cases, Ling Sha can be used to settle the condition.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: The stomach is the sea of food and drink, receiving all substances. If one indulges without restraint in damp, fishy, cold, or overly slippery foods, it results in a build-up of thick phlegm, causing a noisy stomach and symptoms like acid reflux, fullness, and, in severe cases, vomiting and obstruction in the diaphragm. This manifests as a sensation of hunger without hunger, pain without pain, and a state of distress causing unease. Symptoms may include belching, fullness, nausea, leading to pain in the stomach area, indicative of phlegm-fire accumulation. Treatment should focus on herbs like Nansheng, Banxia, and Ju Hong to dispel phlegm; Qinjie, Lian, Zhizhi, Shigao, and Zhimai to reduce fire; and Cangzhu, Baizhu, and Shaoyao to strengthen the spleen and resolve dampness, thereby reinforcing the fundamental essence. Additionally, it is essential to avoid certain foods and practice moderation without disregarding personal discomfort.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p>
<h3>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Belching and Sourness</strong></p>
<p>Belching, swallowing sour air, and vomiting sour substance are caused by retained food. This is evidenced by symptoms in the middle abdomen: when there is fluid, it causes discomfort, and when there is retained food, it causes sourness. Belching and swallowing sour air, expelling rotten gas, and experiencing sour water reversing in the throat often manifest as spitting up clear sour water several times each morning. Some individuals may not experience this discomfort during the day, while others feel a consistent sour ache in the diaphragm. These issues are due to both the harm from food and a deficiency in the middle abdomen. The remedy is to use Pingwei Powder with equal parts shenqu and maiya, or alternatively, Bawei Pingwei Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Disharmony of Spleen and Stomach with Phlegm and Fire</strong></p>
<p>Danxi states that belching indicates the presence of phlegm and fire in the stomach. Chunfu believes that frequent belching is largely due to disharmony in the gastric qi, leading to blockage and discomfort. How can this be identified? Generally, after eating to fullness, people often expel gas since a full meal causes the stomach to feel uneasy. If belching occurs not long after meals, it suggests a deficiency in the stomach with resultant disharmony. While Danxi mentions phlegm and fire, it represents only one aspect of the condition.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;噫&quot; in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; corresponds to what is now called &quot;aerophagia&quot; or belching. The Five Qi Theory states that belching originates from the heart, while the theory of obstruction indicates that when the heart is blocked, the pulse does not flow smoothly, leading to sensations of fullness and labored breathing, accompanied by dryness in the throat and an inclination to belch. The &quot;Great Treatise on True Principles&quot; describes the role of the Taiyang in governing the heavens, while the recovery of the Shaoyin is associated with the occurrence of belching. The Four Seasons indicate that obstruction and counterflow treatment derived from piercing the center leads to death in one day and results in belching. The Yin-Yang Distinctions state that two Yangs and one Yin cause symptoms such as fright, back pain, a tendency to belch, and yawning; this is termed &quot;wind syncope.&quot; The Pulse Interpretation chapter discusses how the Taiyin relates to the heart through belching, indicating that when Yin is abundant and ascends to the Yangming, and since Yangming connects to the heart, it is said that this ascent relates to belching. This indicates that belching emanates from the heart. The Jueyin in the pulse reflects abdominal bloating and belching, with relief from gas leading to a sensation of lightness. The discussion of the Taiyin concludes that prolonged conditions result in frequent belching. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; mentions the Foot Taiyin as active in conditions like abdominal bloating and belching. It also notes that cold qi lodges in the stomach, causing counterflow upwards that leads to belching. Zhang Zhongjing argues that if the upper jiao receives unbalanced qi from the middle jiao, it cannot digest properly, resulting in belching. Furthermore, if the qi of the upper jiao does not return, it can lead to belching and sour regurgitation, indicating that when the qi does not reach its respective areas, digestion is obstructed, resulting in belching and sourness. Thus, belching is viewed as the qi of fire and earth being constrained and unable to vent, leading to its outward expression. Wang’s commentary on the meaning of the heart relating to belching likens it to fire&#39;s ascent, with smoke following the flames; similarly, when phlegm obstructs the diaphragm, the central qi cannot extend, resulting in belching, which is also a manifestation of internal earth qi being stagnant.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Recipe for Betel Nut Powder</strong> </p>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Spirit Pivot&quot; states: The Yellow Emperor asked: What qi causes human belching? Qi Bo replied: Cold qi resides in the stomach, causing counterflow that disperses upward, thus belching is a supplement to the greater yin and yang brightness. It can also be said to nourish the root of the eyebrows. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: The right hand&#39;s front wrist position shows a lack of lung pulse. Bitter, shortness of breath, coughing upwards, throat obstruction, and reversed belching, need to puncture the yang brightness channel for treatment. </p>
<p>The &quot;Shell and Leaf Classic&quot; states: In heat illness, if there is fever, anxiety, fullness, and a desire to vomit, and after three days no sweating occurs, with palpitations in the chest and flanks, cannot turn over, contented cough, red urination, bloody stools, continuous nosebleeds, vomiting blood, counterflow belching without ending, throat pain, loss of appetite, great thirst, tongue ulcers, palm heat, and vomiting after drinking, one should treat the labor palace. </p>

<p>Láogōng pertains to qi counterflow, causing persistent belching. </p>
<p>When belching and hiccups arise due to a blockage and coldness in the diaphragm, moxibustion is applied to the area beneath the armpits and beside the ribs, applying fifty strong strokes. For belching, hiccups, and nausea, a hundred strong strokes of moxibustion are applied at Shígān.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; states: for belching, one should target the middle epigastric point of the spleen channel.</p>
<p>Medical Case Study</p>
<p>The &quot;Dànxī Xīnfǎ&quot; mentions a patient from Xuanzhou with accumulation and stagnation beneath the heart, causing pain and frequent belching of rotting gas. Using Zhǐkè powder, the symptoms were resolved. Qi accumulation in the heart and diaphragm led to slight easing of belching, while the right pulse was weak and short, and the left guān and left chǐ were long, strong, and rapid, indicating heat in the liver. This requires draining the liver and tonifying the spleen, using one qian of Qingpi, two and a half qian of Baizhu, and two qian each of Mutong and Gancao, decocted, then taking fifteen grains of Bǎohé pills and twenty grains of Yìqīng pills for recovery.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　哕即干呕，声更重且长耳。[食(句去口改吉)]乃胸间气塞不通。胃脉浮则为[食(句去口改吉)]，滑则为哕。皆因胃气本虚，汗下太过，或复饮冷水，水寒相搏，胃气虚逆而上，理中汤加肉桂、丁香以散寒下气，茯苓、半夏以消水。而不止者，橘皮干姜汤、橘皮竹茹汤。间有热邪壅郁，上下之气不得通者俱小柴胡加生姜和之。热甚便难者，小承气下之。便软者，诸泻心汤选用。温病发渴饮冷作哕者，升麻葛根汤加茅根。必用半夏，散结气也；用竹茹，清胃解烦也；用生姜，散逆气也。皆因气逆所致，故生姜为呕家圣药。热者乌梅代之。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　　　　吃逆辨名</p>

<p>　　呃逆即《内经》所谓哕也。或曰：成无己、许学士固以哕为呃逆，然东垣、海藏又以哕为干呕，陈无择又以哕名咳逆，诸论不同，今子独取成许二家之说何也？曰：哕义具在《内经》，顾诸家不察耳。按《灵枢》杂病篇末云：哕，以草刺鼻嚏嚏而已；无息而疾迎引之，立已；大惊之亦可已。详此经文三法，正乃治呃逆之法。按呃逆用纸捻刺鼻便嚏，嚏则呃逆立止；或闭口鼻气，使之无息亦立已；或作冤盗贼大惊骇之，亦已。此予所以取成、许二家之论哕为呃逆为得经旨也。若以哕为干呕，设使干呕之人，或使之嚏，或使之无息，或使之大惊，其干呕能立已乎？哕非干呕也明矣！若以哕名咳逆，按《内经》生气通天论曰：秋伤于湿，上逆而咳。阴阳应象论曰：秋伤于湿，冬生咳嗽。<a id="orig-26p" href="#trans-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>以此论之，则咳逆为咳嗽无疑，以春夏冬三时比例自见。孙真人《千金》曰：欬逆者嗽也。本自明白，后人不知何以将咳逆误作呃逆，失之远矣！　　刘宗厚曰：呃逆一证，有虚有实，有火有痰有水气，不可专作寒论。盖伤寒发汗吐下之后，与泻利日久及大病后、妇人产后有此者，皆脾胃气血大虚之故也。若平人食入太速，而气噎，或饮水喜笑错喉而气抢，或因痰水停隔心中，或因暴怒气逆痰厥，或伤寒热病失下而有此者，则皆属实也。夫水性润下，火性炎上，今其气自下冲上，非火而何？大抵治法虚则补之，虚中须分寒热。如因汗吐下后误服寒凉过多，当以温补之；如脾胃阴虚火逆上冲，当以平补之；挟热者，凉而补之。若夫实者如伤寒失下，地道不通，因而呃逆，当以寒下之。如痰饮停畜，或暴怒气逆痰厥，此等必形气俱实，别无恶候，当随其邪之所在，涌之、泄之、清之、利之也。<a id="orig-27p" href="#trans-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>
<p>　　　　　论证</p>
<p>　　呃逆一证，古无是名，其在《内经》本谓之哕，因其呃呃连声，故今以呃逆名之，于义亦妥。观《内经》治哕之法，以草刺鼻而嚏，及气息迎引、大惊之类，是皆治呃之法。此哕本呃逆，无待辨也。自孙真人云：遍寻方论无比名，遂以咳逆为哕，因致后世讹传，乃以咳逆、干呕、噫气之类，互相淆乱，自唐迄今矣。此名之不可不察，亦不可不正也。　　咳逆之名，原出《内经》，本以咳嗽气逆者为言。如气交变大论曰：岁金太过，甚则喘咳逆气。此因喘咳以致气逆，故云咳逆气也。又曰：欬逆甚而血溢。<a id="orig-28p" href="#trans-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>正以咳逆不止而血随气溢，则病之常也，未闻以呃逆而见血者也。即如六元正纪大论云；金郁之发，民病咳逆者，亦是此意。此欬逆之非呃逆，亦甚明矣。而今后世诸公乃悉以哕为咳逆，岂皆未之详察耶？及观丹溪之言，在《纂要》则曰：孙真人误以哕为咳逆，是谓哕非咳逆也。在《心法附录》则曰：咳逆为病，古谓之哕，近谓之呃，此又谓哕即咳逆也。在呕吐门则又曰：有声有物谓之呕吐，有声无物谓之哕，此又以干呕为哕也。前后不一，何其自谬若此！再如海藏、河间诸公，有以哕为干呕者，有以咳逆为噫者，总皆谬矣。<a id="orig-29p" href="#trans-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>盖呕即吐之类，但吐而无物者曰呕，呕而有物者曰吐；腹胀嗳气者曰噫，逆气自下而上者亦曰噫。此四者之辨，自有正名，顾可纷纷若是乎？兹余析而判之曰：哕者呃逆也，非咳逆也。欬逆者，欬嗽之甚者也，非呃逆也。干呕者，无物之吐即呕也，非哕也。噫者，饱食之息，即暧气也，非咳逆也。后人但以此为鉴，则异说之疑可尽释矣。　　呃逆证有伤寒，有杂证，其在古人则悉以虚寒为言。惟丹溪引《内经》之言曰：诸逆冲上，皆属于火。病人见此，似为死证。然亦有实者，不可不知。<a id="orig-30p" href="#trans-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>余向见此说，疑其与古人相左，不以为然，盖亦谓此证必属虚寒，何有实热？兹及晚年历验，始有定见，乃知丹溪此言为不诬也。虽其中寒热虚实，亦有不同，然致呃之因，总由气逆，气逆于下，则直冲于上，无气则无呃，无阳亦无呃，故致之之因，所以必由气也。欲得其象，不见雨中之雷，水中之浡乎？夫阳为阴蔽，所以为雷，而轰轰不已者，此火为雷之本，而火即气也；气为水覆，所以为浡，而汨汨不已者，此气为浡之本，而气即阳也。然病在气分，本非一端，而呃之大要，亦惟三者而已，则一曰寒、二曰热、三曰虚脱。寒呃可温可散，寒去则气自舒也；热呃可降可清，火静而气自平也。惟虚脱之呃，则诚危殆之证，其或免者亦万幸矣。<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Spleen Disease</h3>
<p>If the spleen is distended, there will be joy in belching, with urgency in the limbs, a heavy body, and a tendency to sigh. In cold conditions, there will be pain in the lower back and spine, a dark face with dry ears, inability to eat due to belching, or possibly vomiting blood.</p>
<h3>Febrile Disease Symptoms</h3>
<p>A reverse cough is what Zhang Zhongjing referred to as belching. Belching arises from cold in the stomach. Febrile disease is fundamentally deficient; attacking its heat must lead to belching. Moreover, it is said that if a febrile disease leads to extreme vomiting and diarrhea, and sweating is induced again, the person will have water stagnating, and if water is given to bring forth sweat, belching will occur. This is due to the coldness in the stomach. The treatment involves using dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, or a formula of Qiang Huo and Fu Zi, or a decoction of Ban Xia and ginger, or the Tui Yin San. If taking medicine does not heal, moxibustion will surely cure. The method: for women, bend the nipple down towards the bone in between, and moxibustion three times; for men and small-breasted individuals, take one finger as a measure. Position is important: men on the left, women on the right, burning moxa the size of a small bean directly above the pulsing artery midpoint. However, there are also those with a yang syndrome experiencing a reverse cough, treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang or tangerine peel and bamboo leaf decoction. Zhang Zhongjing also says: if belching occurs with abdominal fullness, by examining the front and back, one can discern which part is obstructed, and relieving that will lead to recovery. Zhang Zhongjing offers no specific formula. The front should use Zhu Ling Decoction, and the back should use Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Decoction. Bian Que&#39;s &quot;Zhong Cang Jing&quot; recommends for febrile cough and reverse cough, using the Clove Powder. Mix cloves and persimmon calyx each at one part, and licorice and ginger each at half a part; boil in hot water to form a dose, and consume it while hot for utmost efficacy.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>In Volume 8 of &quot;Ben Shi Fang,&quot; for treating the symptoms of cold damage, there is a prescription for cough and counterflow with Cardamom Decoction. For treating Yin syndrome&#39;s cough and counterflow, medications like Clove, Fennel, and Nutmeg are used, while they are unsuitable for Yang syndromes.</p>
<p>Coughing and counterflow often arise from initial heat followed by the intake of raw and cold substances or too many cooling medications, leading to conflicting Qi between Yin and Yang. A neighboring servant had a strong fever, and after using cooling medications excessively, experienced coughing and counterflow for four to five days.

<p><strong>Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>The disease of coughing and reverse flow, upon careful examination of various texts, is not explicitly recorded. Only Master Sun mentions that there is no specific term for &quot;coughing and reverse flow&quot; in the discussions of herbal formulas, but that the ancients referred to it as &quot;coughing and reverse sounds.&quot; This often occurs after vomiting or purging, leading to a condition of emptiness and cold in the stomach, which gives rise to this symptom. There are also cases where stomach qi ascends with heat, resulting in coughing with eight or nine continuous sounds, where breath is unable to return. In such cases, one should carefully examine the pulse and symptoms and apply appropriate treatments. Generally, this condition is observed in the elderly, the weak, those suffering from prolonged illnesses, and women after childbirth. These are all signs of a deep-seated illness, not favorable omens.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Ming</strong><br><strong>(Jin Cheng Wujǐ)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Treatment of Febrile Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>How can one clarify the signs of a febrile disease characterized by eructation? Eructation is commonly referred to as a reverse cough, which is characterized by a sound of gulping. If food obstructs the chest and throat, causing the qi to become blocked and unable to descend, there is no sound; this is purely a gastric disorder, albeit with varying degrees of severity. When there is a clash of vacuous cold and one drinks cold water, it induces a large sweating response; the cold qi clashes with the body, leading to eructation after consuming food, indicative of the depletion of gastric qi. After excessive vomiting and purging in cases of severe vacuity, if sweating recurs, it suggests the external qi is stagnant. If one then consumes water to induce sweating, it leads to eructation, which is due to the coldness in the stomach. Furthermore, if the stomach is vacuous and cold, making it unable to receive food, drinking water will also trigger eructation, indicating various gastric disorders. The classics mention: &quot;If the Fuyang pulse is floating, it indicates vacuity; if the Guan pulse is slippery, it indicates eructation.&quot; This suggests a medical fault, blaming the state of vacuity for the real issues at hand. In general, after excessive purging, if the qi in the stomach is reversed, it ultimately leads to eructation.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics state: If one purges a phlegmatic patient too early, it will cause vomiting; if the stomach is originally weak and one attacks its heat, it will cause vomiting; and in cases of Yangming disease where one cannot eat, attacking the heat will surely cause vomiting. All of these situations occur due to the stomach being weak after purging. However, burping is primarily due to the cold water clashing against the stomach, thus one must use Minor Blue Dragon Decoction, removing Ephedra and adding Aconite. As for burping, it is also caused by the obstruction of heat, where qi cannot flow properly. If mild, it indicates a need for harmonization; if severe, it indicates a need for purging. The classics state: When there are tidal fevers accompanied by burping, correlating with Minor Chaihu Decoction, this is a sign of harmonization. If there is burping along with abdominal fullness, by examining conditions before and after, one can understand which part is obstructed; relieving it will lead to recovery, which points to the need for purging. When a cold damage leads to burping, the illness has reached an extreme, unlike lighter conditions such as thirst or irritation. In cases of Sun Pattern Wind, where fire harms and causes sweating, both yin and yang are completely exhausted, leaving the body dry, with only head sweat coming, slightly returning to the neck, abdominal fullness, mild wheezing, dry mouth, and throat decay, and possibly no bowel movements—if prolonged, it leads to disorientation, and in severe cases to burping, indicating an extreme condition. Furthermore, if there is no urination along with abdominal fullness and burping, this condition cannot be treated and represents a true illness. In such cases, although there are divine methods, it’s a situation where one may be helpless; how could one possibly respond?<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Symptoms and Terminology</strong></p>
<p>Cough-reversal, commonly referred to as &#39;a-逆&#39; (e-reversing) or &#39;a-忒&#39; (e-taste), is mentioned only in the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; under the section on distinguishing the pulse. However, in the chapters on the six disorders and whether to induce sweating or purging, there is no mention of it. Later scholars, upon seeing the sections on the six disorders and whether to induce sweating or purging, noted that only &#39;a&#39; is mentioned without reference to cough-reversal, thus labeling it as cough-reversal. Alas! This assertion originated from Master Sun, followed by discussions from Zhu and Cheng, which led to confusion over the definitions of the two terms. The &quot;Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer&quot; states: If a patient appears as if they are panting without actually panting, as if they are vomiting without truly vomiting, and as if they are &#39;a&#39; without being &#39;a&#39;, yet feels bewildered in their chest with no relief, Ginger and Pinellia Decoction is indicated. For dry retching, &#39;a&#39;, or if there are symptoms of limb coldness, Orange Peel Decoction is indicated. For instances of &#39;a&#39; and cough-reversal, Orange Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction is indicated. From this, it is clear that Zhang Zhongjing only identifies it among those similar to dry retching and does not reference cough-reversal. Cough-reversal denotes a sound that abruptly starts and stops; although it may be repeated several times, it is short and quick, resembling a cough in its sound. Therefore, the mention of cough-reversal and &#39;a&#39; implies a desire to expel something but with nothing being expelled, characterized by a harsh and potent sound, lasting until the breath is exhausted before ceasing, unlike the light and less intense nature of dry retching. Thus, both arise from upward-reversed qi, which is why they are both described as &#39;reversed&#39;.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although &quot;Shang Han&quot; distinguishes between cough and reverse flow using the pulse method, and considers cough with reverse flow to be related to hiccups, how can we be sure this is not simply a case of cough leading to breath reversal? Therefore, I cannot assert that it must be hiccups. &quot;Jin Kui Yao Lue&quot; states: for illness characterized by cough and reverse flow, a thin and rapid pulse at the cun position indicates lung abscess. When cough and breath reversal occur, with frequent expectoration of turbid phlegm and an inability to lie down and sleep, use the Zao Jia Wan. If the cough causes breath reversal with a sound like waterfowl in the throat, the She Gan Ma Huang Tang should be employed. These three cases all involve cough and breath reversal; how can we solely categorize cough and reverse flow as hiccups? Currently, while practitioners of Shang Han may consider hiccups, the sections on the six meridians and whether to induce sweating or purging do not mention it, indicating it may have been neglected in the writings. Although hiccups are not discussed in the six meridians section or related sections, one cannot equate cough with breath reversal to hiccups, nor can they conflate cough and breath reversal with hiccups. Some say: you claim that the &quot;Yao Lue&quot; depicts reverse flow not as hiccups; why, then, do later practitioners treat hiccups using Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction and achieve recoveries? I respond: Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction is a formula that is spicy and sweet, having both dispersing and soothing properties, as well as harmonizing and nourishing effects. Despite the differing symptoms, the cause remains the same—an imbalance of pathogenic and righteous qi leading to turmoil. Thus, it can be effectively used for both. Nonetheless, treating two conditions with the same medicine is acceptable, but viewing them as one entity is not.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>Belching is a reverse reaction, where the qi surges upward from below the navel and escapes through the mouth, making a sound. The Book states: &quot;Fire rises.&quot; The Inner Canon says: &quot;All reverse movements that surge upward belong to fire.&quot; Dongyuan argues that fire cannot coexist with the original qi, asserting that fire is a thief of the original qi. Ancient prescriptions always described this condition as a weakness of the stomach without addressing the fire, and treated it with remedies such as clove, persimmon stems, bamboo shavings, and dried citrus peel. It remains unclear which truly reduces fire and which compensates for emptiness. </p>
<p>The yin qi of a person depends on the stomach for nourishment. When the stomach is damaged, the wood qi oppresses it, which is a matter of earth being defeated and wood being robbed. The yin is overrun by fire, unable to be contained internally; the wood, led by the fire, thus surges upward through the clear pathway. To say the stomach is weak means the yin is weak; if this weakness is severe, it may appear to be a critical condition. However, one must be mindful of actual deficiencies. </p>
<p>For coughs with belching, weak qi, or yin fire, one should observe whether there is excess or deficiency to treat accordingly. For deficiency, use Ren Shen Bai Zhu Decoction or Major Tonifying Pill; for excess accompanied by phlegm, induce vomiting with Ren Shen and similar herbs. When phlegm has solidified and qi is stagnant, using honey water for vomiting can help; this indicates dryness of phlegm that cannot be expelled.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p>If there are no other illnesses and e occurs occasionally, this is due to qi reversal. In such cases, use a small amount of pinellia and poria decoction with bitter orange and pinellia. Alternatively, decoct and steep radish seeds, grind to extract the juice, and mix with wood fragrant to disperse heat, which is particularly effective for reversed qi.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> </p>
<p><strong>By Li Chen (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cold Water Clashing</strong></p>
<p>When one experiences a heaving sensation, it means dry retching, with a voice that is heavier and longer. This occurs due to a blockage of qi in the chest. If the stomach pulse is floating, it indicates a blockage; if slippery, it suggests heaving. Both conditions arise from weakened stomach qi, which may be exacerbated by excessive sweating or drinking cold water. The clash of cold water causes the stomach qi to rise abnormally. To alleviate this, one can use the &quot;Li Zhong Tang&quot; with added cinnamon and clove to disperse cold and reduce qi. Additionally, Poria and Banxia can help dispel water retention. If the conditions persist, one may consider using &quot;Gui Pi Tang&quot; or &quot;Zhu Ru Tang.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is a blockage due to heat stagnation that obstructs the upward and downward flow of qi, then &quot;Xiao Chai Hu Tang&quot; with fresh ginger should be included. In severe cases of constipation, the &quot;Xiao Cheng Qi Tang&quot; formula should be used. For soft stools, a selection of &quot;Zhong Shi Tang&quot; is recommended. For warm diseases that cause thirst and result in heaving, &quot;Sheng Ma Ge Gen Tang&quot; with added rhizoma of reed should be used. One must always incorporate Banxia to disperse qi stagnation; bamboo leaves help clear the stomach and relieve restlessness; fresh ginger disperses the rising qi. These issues arise from qi reversal, making fresh ginger an essential remedy for vomiting. If there is heat, black plum can be used as a substitute.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Eating Reversed and Naming</p>
<p>It used to be thought that coughing referred to the cough itself, while the common view equated &quot;呃&quot; with the sound made when something is stuck in the throat. According to the study of rhymes by Yu Huaxi, &quot;食戹&quot; is associated with &quot;呃,&quot; which refers to the rising of qi. There is also a definition of &quot;呃&quot; as &quot;哕,&quot; where &quot;哕&quot; produces a sound before inhalation, while &quot;呃&quot; produces a sound after the reverse flow is complete. The processes of inhalation and exhalation differ. For those who experience both vomiting and &quot;哕,&quot; the issue originates from the stomach; for those who do not, it stems from the lungs. When grains enter the stomach, the stomach qi rises to the lungs, leading to a conflict between cold qi and the fresh grain qi, causing it to reverse back to the stomach, resulting in audible &quot;噫噫.&quot; Thus, Danxi emphasized that the fire from the lower abdomen directly surges up to the chest, interacting with the jueyin, causing a clash between water and fire, which produces the sound.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiating Between Yang and Yin Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Yang patterns present with fever, bitter mouth, chest fullness, and a wiry rapid pulse. For such symptoms, prescribe Xiaochaihu Decoction with bamboo shavings; if there is urinary retention, add Poria or use Zhu Ling Decoction. For constipation, use Tiaogui Chengqi Decoction. In cases of Shaoyin patterns with fullness in the lower abdomen and constipation, or if clear water (from food) is regurgitating, prescribe Xiao Chengqi Decoction. In Yangming patterns with fever and thirst, chest fullness, and irritability, indicated by a surging rapid pulse, this may be fire attacking the lungs, for which use Gan Cao Xie Xin Decoction.</p>
<p>Yin patterns characterized by soft stools and gastric coldness, or due to extreme vomiting and diarrhea leading to aversion to cold with a thin pulse, should use Ju Pi Gan Jiang Decoction. For internal cold and cold extremities, use Qiang Huo Fu Zi Decoction or Ding Xiang Shi Di San, and adjust with Su He Xiang Wan. For gastric cold causing drinking water to clash, prescribe Xiao Qinglong Decoction, omitting Ma Huang and adding Fu Zi. For cold hands and feet, use Xiao Ju Pi Decoction. For chest fullness and weakness, use Da Ju Pi Decoction. As a rule, for food regurgitation, all remedies should include Chen Pi, bamboo shavings, and ginger juice. When symptoms arise indicating the need for proper sweating, or if Yin and Yang are rising and falling, recovery is possible; if food accumulates, leading to urinary retention and phlegm-fire rising, abdominal fullness with inability to urinate, and a sinking and faint pulse, it indicates a grim prognosis. The disease fundamentally relates to water qi, with both exterior and interior signs present.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiation of Illness: Deficiency and Excess</strong></p>
<p>Deficiency arises from internal injuries to the spleen and stomach or from weakness after a major illness, often presenting with a pale face, cold limbs, and loose stools. Excess is due to external factors causing dryness in the stomach or from great anger and overeating, often presenting with a red face, heat in the limbs, and constipation. Excess can be treated, but deficiency is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Heat from Inefficiency of Yin</strong></p>
<p>Fire is the thief of original Qi. The Yin Qi of a person is nourished by the Stomach Qi. When the stomach is harmed, the wood element invades it, the Yin fire takes advantage, unable to guard internally, and the wood carries the fire upwards, severely worsening deficiency. Those with damp-heat from rich foods can take the Ten Flavor Xiao Chai Hu Decoction along with Dan Huang Bo pills or tune with Yi Yuan Powder. For those with strong stomach fire and good appetite, use Xiao Ban Xia Decoction adding Shan Zhi, Huang Qin to induce vomiting. For excessive fire, add Huang Lian, Huang Bo to Yi Yuan Powder. For those with diarrhea or women postpartum, experiencing reversal from the navel upwards, particularly at night, all belong to Yin deficiency, needing Si Wu Decoction with added Zhi Mu, Bo He, Chen Pi, and Zhu Ru.</p>
<p><strong>Strain and Injury to the Spleen</strong></p>
<p>Severe labor and poverty cause fire to rise and turbidity to ascend, needing Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction or Sheng Mai San with a little Huang Bo and Fu Zi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Prolonged Illness</strong></p>
<p>Prolonged illness is a dangerous condition. A rapid pulse indicates fire, and if metal is affected, it is likely to be fatal. In cases of prolonged illnesses from cold damage, vomiting, or diarrhea, along with symptoms of hiccups, this indicates fire attempting to ascend, being obstructed by cold pathogens in the stomach. Therefore, it is appropriate to administer a blend of clove and persimmon calyx powder, Qianghuo Fuzi Decoction, or a modified Li Zhong Decoction with increased ginseng. For long-standing cases, use Sanxiang Powder or decoction of papaya root. If there is middle vacuity, stupor, and a knotty pulse, use the honey-fried licorice decoction to rescue.</p>
<p><strong>Food Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>When the stomach is overly full, the pathway of ascension and descent is obstructed. One should use the Er Chen Decoction with added bitter orange peel and sand ginger.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm and Qi</strong></p>
<p>When phlegm is obstructed above and fire is activated below, without other symptoms, and if hiccups suddenly arise from the chest, one should use the Qinjian Er Chen Decoction, or simply take decoctions of tangerine peel, pinellia, and ginger. Alternatively, ginseng and reed decoction can be used for expulsion. Stagnant phlegm due to anger and heat is also manageable. Ginseng and reed clear the lungs, allowing the lungs to regain function and restoring fire and earth to their proper places. If one is affected by emotional distress, the Mukxiang Yungqi Powder should be used, administered with radish decoction, or the Suzi Jiangqi Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Mismanaged Downward Movement</strong></p>
<p>When the pathways are obstructed, leading to hiccups, cold medicines should be administered. Da Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate. If the pulse is excessively weak and on the verge of collapse, it is necessary to use Liang Ge Powder or Detoxification Decoction to nourish yin and diminish yang; large purgation should be avoided. After sweating, vomiting, and purging, if stomach heat remains, one can take Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with tangerine peel and bamboo shavings, or decoctions of tangerine peel and bamboo shavings, or a single heart-purge decoction.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>When a person eats too quickly, inhales water into the lungs, or laughs excessively, it is considered excess. If there is belching from eating or laughing, one can use paper twists to stimulate the nose for a sneeze, or holding their breath for a long time may stop it. For water-related belching, one may use Xiao Xian(xiong) Tang or Xiao Qing Long Tang without Ma Huang, simply to clear and resolve. Generally, if one has sweated, vomited, or taken too many cooling medications, they should take warming tonics; if there is upward rising of spleen and stomach yin fire, they should take balanced tonics; if there is heat present, cooling tonics are appropriate. &quot;Jufang&quot; usually employs Dingfu to warm and assist the fire, diminishing insufficiencies and benefiting the excess, thus it is likely that belching and counterflow will inevitably lead to death.</p>
<h3>Summary of Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>For cold damage with cough and counterflow, Zhongjing refers to cough counterflow as &quot;yi,&quot; with two types of conditions: yin and yang. The yin condition arises from cold in the stomach. There may also be cases where the initial condition was heat, but excessive sweating later led to vomiting and purging, attacking heat too vigorously, leading to stomach cold. For cough and counterflow due to cold, use dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, or half summer and ginger decoction. For cough and counterflow, add half summer and aged tangerine peel in equal parts to the decoction of platycodon and bitter orange, and boil with ten slices of ginger; this also treats the yin condition of cough and counterflow. The yang condition of cough counterflow results from heat in the stomach, treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang or tangerine peel and bamboo leaf decoction. If the yang condition of cough counterflow also includes abdominal pain, inquire about the location of the discomfort. If it is in the front, use Zhu Ling Tang; if in the back, use Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Tang.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are cases where one experiences belching without illness, which is due to the reversal of qi. In severe cases, it may persist for a day or two. It is advisable to use a small amount of Banxia Fuling Decoction, adding Zhi Shi and Banxia, or to use a decoction to soak radish seeds, extract the juice, and adjust with Mu Xiang to regulate the qi, taking it warm, which is best for combating reversed qi. If there is severe cold in the stomach, causing persistent cough and possibly vomiting, and light remedies do not take effect, one should use clove decoction, and add Fuzi and glutinous rice decoction, increasing the amounts of stir-fried Sichuan pepper and cloves to ten each per dose.</p>
<p>When the stomach is full, it leads to belching; when it is deficient, it causes &quot;huò&quot; (a type of prolonged belching). Reversal indicates insufficiency in the stomach and excess heat above the diaphragm. Coughing with reversal is a condition referred to in ancient texts as &quot;huò&quot; and more recently as &quot;è,&quot; stemming from cold in the stomach, causing the cold qi to reverse and lead to belching, which is the most serious symptom. Occasionally, there may be heated belching seen in cases of febrile diseases. If belching occurs due to other illnesses, it still relates to cold, and the remedy should be one liang of Banxia, two halves of fresh ginger, and one bowl of water, decocted to half a bowl and taken hot; alternatively, take ten cloves and ten cut persimmon stems, boiled in half a bowl of white water. If ineffective, one may add an additional ten cloves to a modified Li Zhong Decoction with half a qian of Zhi Ke and Fuling, and one qian of Banxia.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Evidence and Distinction of Names</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Huò&quot; refers to a severe form of dry heaving, which differs from regular dry heaving in that it is accompanied by sound, is clamorous and prolonged, producing sound without substance. This occurs due to the inherent weakness of the stomach qi, often exacerbated by excessive sweating, drinking too much cold water, or cold water clashing against internal cold, leading to a pathological reversal. Additionally, if heat qi accumulates, obstructing passage up and down, it may also cause &quot;huò&quot;. In mild cases, it can be alleviated with harmonizing and dispersing methods; in severe cases, warming and dispersing measures are needed. If &quot;huò&quot; is accompanied by abdominal fullness and difficulty in defecation, first administer a half summer ginger decoction, then proceed with a small purgative. If urinary output is insufficient, use a pigweed decoction. Should &quot;huò&quot; persist, apply a ginger and tangerine peel decoction. For febrile conditions with heat, if &quot;huò&quot; arises from excessive cold water intake, a rehmannia and kudzu decoction is indicated. If &quot;huò&quot; occurs without urination, it indicates a grave condition.</p>
<p>As for coughing reversely, it is commonly referred to as &quot;è tè&quot; in vernacular. The sound may just begin in the throat and then abruptly stop, resulting in short, consecutive sounds that are fleeting. The ancients distinguished this as &quot;huò&quot;, but that is incorrect. &quot;Huò&quot; is not different from dry heaving; the only distinction is that it produces a prolonged, clamorous sound without substance. When the illness progresses to &quot;huò&quot;, it becomes critical and difficult to treat.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, when there is obstruction in the chest that prevents downward flow, it leads to the expulsion of a rough sound externally. Thus, these two conditions are similar, arising from the original weakness of the stomach qi, excessive sweating, or further drinking of cold water, which clashes with the coldness, resulting in a reversal of the qi. The texts say: when the yang pulse is floating, it indicates obstruction; and when the pulse is slippery, it signifies a rough sound. This is a medical fault, blaming weakness for taking too much from the reality. </p>
<p>There is also the possibility of heat qi being trapped, preventing the qi from circulating properly, which may cause a rough sound. For mild cases, harmonizing and promoting circulation may suffice; for severe cases, warmth and dispersion are necessary. </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, there is no urination and the abdomen is distended, accompanied by a rough sound, and if there is a scattered pulse without coherence, even a divine physician may not be able to intervene effectively; this condition differs from that of cold damage with a rough sound and reversed qi. If one incorrectly attributes rough sounds and coughing to reversed qi, it would lead to great mistakes. Therefore, it is important to distinguish clearly when encountering illness.</p>
<p>In cases with reversed coughing and little bowel movement, one should use the major purging decoction. This is due to heat qi colliding with the spleen and lungs. If the stool is soft, one would use the heart-purging decoction to combat the reversal of stomach qi. If the pulse is scattered, it should not be treated. For reversed coughing with mild fever, one can use Xiao Chai Hu Tang with tangerine peel and fresh ginger. </p>
<p>In instances of cold damage, there may be excessive sweating or indulgence in cold water, leading to the clash of coldness and the rough, unpleasant, prolonged sound known as a rough sound, which is not the same as dry heaving.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Xu Chunfu)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Distinctions in Symptoms</strong>  </p>
<p>Coughing and reverse cough signify a progressive dry cough, characterized by sound without phlegm, continuous and unending. The energy rises from the lower abdomen and ascends, exiting through the throat, as if struck and causing the reverse effect. There are also instances where the cough emits from the throat, followed by a sound that draws back into the throat, which is what constitutes the reverse cough symptom. Hiccups refer to a sound entering the throat. If there are both coughing and hiccuping sounds striking forth, persistent and in the tens of thousands without cessation, and medication proves ineffective, then the method of inducing vomiting should be employed to expel phlegm and saliva immediately. Hiccups, on the other hand, produce a sound exiting, and the sound ceases before inhalation; the root of this occurs in the stomach, elaborated upon in discussions of vomiting, thus will not be revisited here. Hiccups are characterized by an inward sound, where the energy reverses into the throat, and the sound ceases before exhalation; the root of this lies in the lungs, and their inhalation and exhalation differ greatly, making them easy to distinguish.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing and Reflux Belong to Heat</p>
<p>The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: Coughing and reflux refer to what Zhong Jing called regurgitation. Regurgitation arises from stomach cold. When a febrile disease is fundamentally deficient, attacking its heat will inevitably lead to regurgitation. It also mentions that after severe vomiting and purging in a febrile disease, if one subsequently sweats profusely, regurgitation arises because of the deficiency and coldness of stomach qi. Therefore, one should use remedies such as dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, Qianghuo and Aconite decoction, Banxia and ginger decoction, or the Retreating Yin powder. These are Zhong Jing&#39;s methods for treating regurgitation. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; mistakenly equates cough and reflux, thus treating heat as if it were cold. Zhong Jing&#39;s discussion of regurgitation does not imply it is the same as coughing and reflux; the former arises from cold while the latter comes from heat. Since the &quot;Book of Living&quot; regards coughing and reflux as the same, how can one not use heating medicines? The differentiation of syndromes is critical; thus, the choice of remedies must be precise. If it were not for Dongyuan&#39;s diligent clarification of these errors, how would subsequent scholars come to understand this?<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>Dong Yuan said: In the &quot;Living Human Book,&quot; cough and reverse flow are considered a type of belching, suggesting that if it can be treated with purgatives, it is advisable to use the Gui Cheng Qi Decoction. This is because the evil qi resides in the stomach, thus it is identified as belching, which is indeed the case. However, one should not forget that cough and reverse flow indicate that the Yangming has lost its downward transmission to the Taiyin. The &quot;Living Human Book&quot; discusses the root of fire but does not address its branch; it mentions that fire rises to an extreme height leading to cough and reverse flow. Viewed together, belching and cough are manifestations of the same heat. Specifically, belching pertains to the root, associated with the gallbladder, stomach, and the middle; whereas cough pertains to the branch, associated with the heart, lungs, and the upper. If the branch is evident above, then it is rightfully called a branch and does not need to be termed belching. If it is not indicated that it is belching, later generations might only notice the gallbladder and stomach as the root, neglecting the heart and lung as the branch.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The treatment should reduce internal heat and harmonize the Qi.</p>
<p>Coughing with a reverse flow often holds characteristics of coldness in ancient formulas. Therefore, ingredients such as clove, persimmon stem, ginger, and warming medicines are used, although this may be one-sided. Coughing with a reverse flow can be due to deficiency, excess, or heat. When the Qi forcefully rises from below to create sound, what else could it be? Generally, in cases of epidemic fevers, after sweating, vomiting, and purging, overusing cooling medications may lead to weak and cold stomach Qi. This could also occur. In such instances, one must use warming tonics, and not heat-inducing medicines. </p>
<p>Aside from this, if it occurs after an illness, it is often due to prolonged heat when sweating was not adequately achieved, causing enduring heat stagnation, leading to Yin deficiency. If one sweats and purges at the wrong time, it results in excessive heat, so even after the fever has subsided, there can still be heat lurking in the Yin, rising in combination with weak stomach Qi, creating a sound that results in cough (food stagnation) symptoms. Ingredients such as bamboo shavings, ophiopogon, and orange peel can help alleviate constipation with purgative decoctions.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Inducing Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>For those who bear repressed anger and are unable to act on their will, many exhibit symptoms of coughing and rebellion. The remedy involves clearing heat, purging phlegm, and soothing qi; if this proves ineffective, it is essential to induce vomiting. This can be done using a decoction of ginseng and reed, with a small amount of salt, which should be consumed. After a little while, inducing vomiting will expel the thick phlegm and saliva, and the cough will cease.</p>
<p>In cases where there is a substantial condition caused by an external cold leading to a lack of downward movement, resulting in constipation and cough, it is urgent to use cold medicines for purging. If the issue arises from excessive food intake, from phlegm or fluid stagnation, or due to violent anger and qi rebellion, it is all considered a substantial condition. In such cases, the combination of gentle purging methods, especially using ginseng and reed, is particularly effective. </p>
<p>Cough and rebellion must be assessed for excess or deficiency. For instance, Danxi treated an elderly man who developed cough after constipation with ginseng and atractylodes decoction, along with a major supplement pill, and he recovered.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Erni, which is referred to as &quot;he&quot; in the “Inner Canon,” has varying interpretations. Some say Cheng Wujia and Xu Xueshi consider “he” to be erni, while Dongyuan and Haizang regard it as dry retching, and Chen Wuze names it coughing reverse. There are different opinions among scholars; why do you alone adopt the views of Cheng and Xu? The meaning of “he” is clearly stated in the “Inner Canon,” but various schools overlook this. According to the end of the miscellaneous diseases chapter in the “Spiritual Pivot,” “he” is merely caused by a tickling sensation in the nose, leading to sneezing; there are methods that can suddenly stop it. Similarly, if one is startled, it can also be alleviated. Examining these three methods from the text reveals that they are indeed treatments for erni. </p>
<p>For erni, pricking the nose with a piece of paper leads to sneezing, and the sneezing will immediately stop the erni; another method is to close the mouth and restrict the breathing to stop it; or one can use a great shock from a thief or robber to achieve the same result. This is why I adopt the interpretation of “he” as erni by Cheng and Xu, for it aligns with the essence of the text. If one considers “he” as dry retching, could dry retching be stopped by sneezing, holding one’s breath, or being startled? It is clear that “he” is not dry retching! </p>
<p>As for the interpretation of “he” as coughing reverse, according to the “Inner Canon,” it states: &quot;In autumn, damage from dampness causes upward rebellion and coughing.&quot; The theory of yin and yang correspondence also indicates: &quot;In autumn, damage from dampness leads to coughing in winter.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this discussion, it is clear that &quot;ke ni&quot; refers to coughing, as evident from its comparison throughout the three seasons of spring, summer, and winter. The Daoist Master Sun said in &quot;Qianjin&quot;: &quot;Ke ni&quot; is certainly a cough. This is self-evident, but later generations have mistakenly interpreted &quot;ke ni&quot; as &quot;e ni,&quot; which is a significant error. </p>
<p>Liu Zonghou mentioned: The symptom of &quot;e ni&quot; can be either due to deficiency or excess, and can involve heat, phlegm, or water qi; it should not be exclusively categorized under cold conditions. For instance, after sweating, vomiting, or purging due to a cold, and in cases of prolonged diarrhea or after a serious illness, or postpartum conditions in women, such symptoms arise from severe deficiency of the spleen and stomach qi and blood. </p>
<p>If a healthy person eats too quickly, causing qi to get stuck, or if they drink water and laugh, leading to choking, or if phlegm-water obstructs the heart, or if anger causes qi to rebel and phlegm to ascend, or if it occurs post-illness due to heat without proper purging, all these are classified as excess conditions. Water is moist and descendent, while fire is hot and ascendant; if the qi is pushing upward from below, what else could it be but fire? Generally, the treatment for deficiency is to tonify it, but within deficiency, one must differentiate between cold and heat. If due to excessive consumption of cold after sweating, vomiting, or purging, it should be treated with warming tonics; if due to deficiency-heat from the spleen and stomach, it should be treated with harmonizing tonics; if heat is present, cool and tonify. </p>
<p>In contrast, conditions like excess from cold in cases of illness leading to &quot;e ni&quot; necessitate cooling and purging. Similarly, when phlegm-water stagnates, or if overwhelming anger leads to rebellious qi and phlegm, these symptoms must be characterized by substantial excess qi, with no other adverse signs. The treatment should target the location of the pathogenic qi by inducing, purging, clearing, or draining as needed.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Reversal of Qi</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;reversal of qi&quot; did not exist in ancient texts; in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it was originally called &quot;hiccup,&quot; named for the repeated sound it produces, hence it is now referred to as reversal of qi, which is also appropriate in meaning. Observing the methods to treat hiccups in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; one uses herbs to stimulate the nose to induce sneezing, or applies techniques like breath manipulation and shock, which are all remedies for hiccups. This hiccup is fundamentally the reversal of qi, and there is no need for further distinction. </p>
<p>Master Sun stated: Amidst the extensive search for methods, no similar name was found, thus he equated &quot;coughing and reversal&quot; with hiccups. This led to subsequent generations misinterpreting and confusing &quot;coughing,&quot; &quot;dry heaving,&quot; and &quot;belching&quot; since the Tang Dynasty. Such terminologies must be examined and corrected. </p>
<p>The term &quot;coughing and reversal&quot; originally comes from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; where it refers to the phenomenon of coughing accompanied by reversed qi. For instance, in the &quot;Great Treatise on Changes,&quot; it states that when the metal element (autumn) is excessive, it can lead to coughing and reversed qi. This indicates that coughing results in reversed qi, thus it is called &quot;reversed qi.&quot; It also mentions: &quot;When coughing and reversal worsen, blood may overflow.&quot;<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is common for a condition where persistent cough and reverse flow of qi lead to blood, but it has not been heard of that coughing with reverse flow results in blood. Just as the Great Discussion on the Six Origins states: when there is metal distress, people suffering from cough with reverse flow relates to this notion. It is also clear that this cough is not the same as the reverse flow of qi. However, in later generations, some officials have defined reverse flow only as a type of cough, which shows they have not thoroughly examined the matter. </p>
<p>Observing the words of Danxi, in &quot;Essentials Compilation,&quot; it is stated: Master Sun mistakenly identified reverse flow as a cough, indicating that reverse flow is not cough. In the &quot;Heart Methods Appendix,&quot; it is stated: cough with reverse flow means the ancient term was &quot;哕&quot; (huè), a recent term being &quot;呃&quot; (è), suggesting again that &quot;哕&quot; is indeed cough with reverse flow. The section on vomiting states: if there is sound and material, it is called vomiting; if there is sound without material, it is called &quot;哕.&quot; Thus, dry heaving is also categorized as &quot;哕.&quot; The inconsistencies here are quite mistaken! Furthermore, some officials from Haizang and Hejian view &quot;哕&quot; as dry heaving while considering cough with reverse flow as &quot;噫&quot; (yī), which is all erroneous.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The act of nausea can be categorized into two types: when one vomits without any material, it is called &quot;nausea,&quot; and when one vomits with material, it is called &quot;vomiting.&quot; The condition of abdominal distension and belching is referred to as &quot;regurgitating,&quot; while the upward movement of qi from below is also called &quot;regurgitating.&quot; These four terms have distinct meanings and proper names; can they be confused in this way? Therefore, I analyze and clarify them: belching refers to the regurgitation of food, not a cough reflex. A severe cough reflex is referred to as a strong cough, not regurgitation. Dry heaving is empty vomiting, which is nausea, not belching. Regurgitating refers to the breath after a full meal, which is warm qi, not a cough reflex. If later generations take this as a guide, then the doubts arising from differing opinions can be resolved. The symptoms of regurgitation can be associated with typhoid fever or other mixed conditions; in ancient texts, they were all regarded as manifestations of cold deficiency. However, Danxi cites the Neijing, stating that all regurgitations that rise upward belong to fire. When patients exhibit this, it may seem like a critical condition.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I once saw this statement and doubted that it contradicted ancient thinkers, thinking it incorrect, as I believed this evidence must pertain to the condition of coldness and not to actual heat. However, with my experiences in later years, I gained a definitive understanding and realized that Danxi&#39;s words were indeed not false. Although the distinctions between cold and heat, void and substance vary, the fundamental cause of a cough is always due to reversed Qi. When Qi is reversed from below, it rushes upward; without Qi, there is no cough, and without Yang, there is also no cough. Thus, the cause must be related to Qi. If one wishes to understand its manifestations, do we not witness thunder in the rain or splashing in the water? For Yang is obscured by Yin, giving rise to thunder, which roars unceasingly; this fire is the origin of thunder, and fire is precisely Qi. Similarly, Qi is concealed by water, giving rise to splashing, which flows continuously; this Qi is the origin of splashing, and Qi is indeed Yang. However, when the illness resides in the Qi aspect, it is not just one side; the primary causes of coughing are merely three: first, cold; second, heat; and third, deficiency and collapse. A cough from cold can be warmed or dispersed, and once the cold leaves, the Qi will naturally ease. A cough from heat can be lowered or cleared, and when the fire calms, the Qi will stabilize. Yet a cough arising from deficiency and collapse is indeed a perilous sign, and those who escape from it are exceedingly fortunate.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Cough</h3>
<p>In cases of mixed symptoms of hiccup, although they arise from reversed qi, there are those with a combination of cold, those with a combination of heat, those due to food stagnation causing reversal, those due to qi stagnation causing reversal, those due to deficiency of the middle qi causing reversal, and those due to depletion of yin qi causing reversal. However, by observing the causes and treating the qi, there will be no cases that cannot be cured. If hiccups are mild or occur occasionally, and the qi is flowing smoothly, there is no need for treatment. Only when hiccups are frequent or severe must one consider that the qi is greatly reversed, or there is significant depletion of the spleen and kidney&#39;s vital energy. </p>
<p>Actual patterns of symptoms are not difficult to treat, but depletion of the vital energy is the most dangerous condition. When cold stagnation causes hiccups, it might be due to wind-cold, consumption of raw or cold foods, or the inherent cold nature of the internal organs that occasionally leads to reversal. In such cases, removing the obstruction and suppressing the cold will stop the hiccup. Suitable remedies include tangerine peel soup, San Yin clove powder, or Er Chen decoction with five to seven slices of fresh ginger, or combined with other formulas such as Guanjian decoction or licorice and dried ginger soup, or tangerine peel and dried ginger soup. When the cold is severe, use Jiangshui powder or Si Ni decoction.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Stomach fire causes hiccups, and its symptoms are quite numerous. However, upon examining the pulse, if it is slippery and solid while the body is not deficient in energy, and there is stagnation in the chest and diaphragm, or if the stools are hard or do not pass, it indicates that there is fire in the stomach, which causes the hiccups. By reducing this fire, the hiccups will naturally stop, and using “An Wei Drink” is most effective. I have cured many people with these symptoms.</p>
<p>For hiccups accompanied by bloating due to qi counterflow, it is advisable to use a modified Er Chen Decoction with added Wu Yao, or Baoguan Dingxiang Shidi Powder, or Qiang Huo Fu Zi Decoction, or Shen Xiang Powder.</p>
<p>If hiccups are caused by food stagnation, one should use a modified Er Chen Decoction with added Hawthorn, White Mustard Seed, and Wu Yao, or employ Da He Zhong Drink with added Dried Ginger and Mu Xiang.</p>
<p>For those with deficiency cold in the middle burner (spleen and stomach) and hiccups caused by qi counterflow, one should use a modified Li Zhong Decoction with added Dingxiang, or Warm Stomach Drink with Dingxiang. If hiccups are a result of internal injury from overwork and fatigue, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Dingxiang. Generally, severe cold in the middle burner stems from deficiency in spleen and stomach qi. If the spleen and stomach are not deficient, then the cold will not be severe; hence, when treating cold, the focus should be on spleen qi. If there is no heat present, ingredients like Fresh Ginger, Ban Xia, Dingxiang, Shidi, Bai Zhu, and Cinnamon can be used.</p>
<p>After vomiting or purging when the stomach qi is slightly deficient, or if hiccups are accompanied by heat in the diaphragm, one should use Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction suitably. </p>
<p>For deficiency cold in the lower burner, the liver and kidney’s ability to produce vital energy is impaired, hence hiccups are commonly seen in weak individuals due to insufficient original yang, which is easily suppressed.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The root of this nausea mainly lies in the kidneys; therefore, I formulate the Guiqi Decoction to address it, which is quite effective. Some use the Li Yin Decoction with added clove to disperse the qi, and it is also excellent. </p>
<p>In cases following severe illness, or those who are extremely thin and weak, or who suffer from weakness due to overexertion leading to nausea, this is the most critical condition. If the deficiency within is noted, one should promptly nourish the spleen; if it is a deficiency of yin, one should promptly nourish the kidneys. The first two methods are indeed firm, yet if there is still concern, then one should resort to great tonifying formulas like the Yuan Decoction and the You Gui Decoction, which may be the best options.</p>
<p>In cases of nausea, if the voice is strong and the energy is robust with a slippery and full pulse, one generally should clear it down; if the voice is small and the breath slight with a weak pulse, one generally should warm and tonify. </p>
<p>For nausea due to exterior cold, it ultimately is another manifestation of qi counterflow, which may differ from mixed conditions, as mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing regarding its categories. However, if there are still things unclarified or treatments insufficient, I will briefly mention them as follows.</p>
<p>In cases of cold in the stomach due to external cold, conditions are generally similar to the previous mixed conditions and should be treated as mentioned before with warming and middle-regulating remedies. If the stomach is cold and drinking water leads to nausea, then it should be treated according to Zhang Zhongjing’s methods. If the pathogen resides in the exterior, it has no relation to the interior, thus there is no nausea.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the evil of lesser yang is located between the half exterior and half interior, resulting in alternating chills and fever along with qi being hindered leading to hiccups, it can be treated with Chai-Chen decoction. If accompanied by cold, add cloves; if with heat, add Huangqin; or Xiao-Chai-Hu decoction may also be appropriate. </p>
<p>In cases of cold damage causing downward obstruction, if the evil enters the upright yangming and internal heat reaches its extreme, with the three burners dried up, the vaginal discharge ceased, and hiccups arising due to upward qi rebellion, it is essential to clear the heat and remove the obstruction, so that the rebellious qi can descend and thus alleviate the hiccups. However, it is crucial to carefully assess the severity of the evil: if there are no solid distension symptoms, only dryness and heat, then Bai-Hu decoction or Zhu-ye-Shi-Gao decoction, or Xie-Xin decoction to cool and resolve should be used; if there is indeed dry feces constipation and solid distension, then San-Cheng-Qi decoction should be administered.</p>
<p>In cases of cold damage where the evil has not yet dispersed, using too much warming and tonifying treatments can cause the middle burner qi to rebel, which can especially lead to hiccups; in such cases, Anwei drink is the best remedy. If there is rebellious qi without fire, then use Ju-Pi decoction; if there is simultaneous exterior evil unresolved, then Chai-Chen decoction is appropriate.</p>
<p>In situations where cold damage is mistakenly attacked, whether by vomiting, purging, or wrongly using cold cooling methods, leading to severe deficiency and cold of the spleen, kidneys, and stomach, which causes hiccups, it becomes a critical condition. Immediate adjustment using methods that warm the stomach and regulate yin is needed, for delay may render the situation irreparable.</p>
<p>Observing Zhang Zihe&#39;s method of vomiting can also treat hiccups, as it can allow the qi to extend and disperse when it is stagnant. Therefore, for cases of fullness and stagnation, Zhang Zihe&#39;s method is indeed applicable.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Method of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo, Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment Method</strong>  </p>
<p>When the qi is disturbed and cannot rise, it is in a state of stagnation. If the qi can rise and spread freely, but is instead suppressed and unable to ascend, there will inevitably be signs of rebellious qi, requiring the use of medicine to promote its upward movement, allowing the qi to spread and expand. </p>
<p>The prescription includes three qian each of Dang Gui, Bai Shao, Huang Qi, and Bai Zhu, five qian of Shu Di, and one qian each of Ren Shen, Fu Ling, and Chuan Xiong, along with five fen each of Chai Hu and Sheng Ma, to be decocted in water for consumption. This is the Eight Treasure Decoction, effective for balancing blood and qi. If licorice is used instead of Huang Qi, it no longer qualifies as the Eight Treasure Decoction. </p>
<p>Once the balance of qi and blood is achieved without any deviation, one can then use Sheng Ma and Chai Hu to help it rise, promoting the flow of blood and qi, thus eliminating any signs of rebellious qi. If only the yang is supplemented without the yin, the yang will flourish while the yin will decline; conversely, if only the yin is supplemented without the yang, the yin will prosper while the yang will diminish.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, it is necessary to supplement it comprehensively. Initially, this is beneficial, and it should not be viewed alongside the dispersed kinds. When water qi overwhelms the heart protector&#39;s network, there is persistent belching, which is a sign of impending death. However, I believe it can be salvaged because the heart protector is overwhelmed by water qi, and there is concern about the heart being harmed. Therefore, persistent belching occurs because it seeks to summon the qi of the five organs to jointly rescue the heart threatened by water qi. As water qi overwhelms the heart protector, leading to belching symptoms, it is essential to merely disperse the dampness of water qi, and the belching will cease naturally.</p>
<p>To stop belching, use the following decoction: one tael each of Poria and Job&#39;s tears; three qian each of Atractylodes, White Atractylodes, and Ginseng; five qian of Foxnut; one qian each of Pinellia and dried tangerine peel; five fen of Clove; and three fen of the fruit of Evodia. Boil in water and take the decoction. After one dose, belching will stop; after two doses, it will be cured. This formula strengthens the stomach and solidifies the spleen. Although it promotes the excretion of dampness and water, it does not deplete true qi; thus, it can supplement the heart protector and strengthen the position of the heart ruler without needing to treat belching—belching will resolve itself.</p>
<p>Formula:</p>
<p>Small Chengqi Decoction [Zhongjing, same below] is used to treat constipation and frequent belching with incoherent speech. Use four ounces of Rhubarb, three ounces of Magnolia Bark, and three pieces of roasted bitter orange (large). Combine the three ingredients and simmer with four liters of water until one liter and two portions remain. Strain and divide into two warm doses; cease once benefits are obtained.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For persistent vomiting and belching: take three pounds of reed root, chop it, and boil it in water to create a concentrated juice.

<p>Another remedy: mix vinegar with flour to make twenty to thirty small pills. Cook them in boiling water, then strain and place them in cold water until warm; swallow two or three pills. If the vomiting stops, there’s no need to take more; if it continues, take more in the evening.</p>
<p>For a feeling of fullness in the heart accompanied by vomiting, with a firm mass below the heart: take eight taels of ginger, three quarts of water, and boil down to one quart. Take five handfuls of pinellia, wash it, then boil five quarts of water down to one quart. Combine this juice with the ginger broth to make one and a half quarts, and divide to take in portions.</p>
<p>For vomiting due to warm illness from excessive drinking: use half a pound each of loquat leaves (after removing the hairs) and lemon grass root, boil in four quarts of water to produce two quarts, and drink a little.</p>
<p>For kidney qi causing belching: kidney qi rises from the abdomen to the throat, where the reverse qi connects but cannot be expelled, leading to many sounds of belching without relief. This occurs due to cold injuring the stomach, with kidney deficiency and qi reversal rising to the stomach. This is referred to as &quot;belching&quot; in the &quot;Nanjing,&quot; and the &quot;Suwen&quot; states that for deep illness with this sound, this remedy should be taken. If it does not stop, moxibustion should be applied to the Qimen, Guanyuan, and Shenshu points.

<hr>
<p>Persistent belching: Fry six pieces of stone lotus meat until they turn reddish-yellow, grind into a powder, mix with half a cup of cold cooked water, and take to stop it.</p>
<p>For treating unceasing coughing and belching: Use fifteen pieces of persimmon stems, half a piece of white salt plum, and one cup of water, decocting to six parts, and take warm at any time.</p>
<p>For cold-induced vomiting: Use two qian of wuzhuyu soaked, and two qian each of the white part of green tangerine peel. Add one cup of water and three slices of ginger, decoct to seven parts to take. Another prescription: Use powdered Sichuan pepper to make pills the size of wutong seeds, taking twenty pills each time with white broth. Another prescription: Use two qian each of dried tangerine peel and bitter orange to decoct and take.</p>
<p>Method to treat stubborn cough when medication is ineffective: Use equal parts of sulfur and frankincense, decocted in wine for the patient to inhale. Another method involves using realgar alone, decocted in wine for inhalation.</p>
<p>For chronic cough with repeated coughs of one or two dozen times: Take half a cup of ginger juice, one spoonful of honey, decoct until hot, and take warm. Effective after three doses.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: The Yellow Emperor asked: What qi causes belching in a person? Qibo replied: Food enters the stomach, and the stomach qi rises to the lungs. Now, if cold qi and new grain qi both enter the stomach together, they disturb each other, the true and the evil qi attack each other, and the qi reverses and exits the stomach, thus causing belching. Strengthen the hand taiyin and drain the foot shaoyin. The lung is responsible for belching; therefore, treat with hand taiyin and foot shaoyin.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case Report</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A woman presented with a heavy head and strong heat, a flushed face, alternating chills and fevers, dry heaving and coughing, pain in the chest and ribs, difficulty turning over, tinnitus, and loss of appetite. Initially, a purgative was administered, followed by a modified Yiyuan San with Qingdai and mint powder in two to three doses, resulting in reduced symptoms. A physician diagnosed that this illness often makes one want to cry to feel relief. The woman confirmed this, stating it happens frequently but she did not understand why. The physician explained that the Shaoyang fire was attacking the Lung metal, which was weakened by the fire, causing a lack of expression. Since the Lung governs sorrow, this led to the urge to cry for relief. Adding Guizhao Huanglian Jiedu Decoction in several doses resulted in complete recovery. </p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Xinfah&quot; states: A girl beyond the age of marriage had a disposition of restlessness and likened rich tastes. During the hot months, she became extremely angry, leading to coughing and a convulsive body, with a pulse that was difficult to diagnose, and she appeared dazed with both her form and energy being substantial. It was determined that phlegm was present above the diaphragm, anger was repressed, and the heat from phlegm clashed, obstructing the qi from descending, making vomiting necessary. A decoction of ginseng and reed was prescribed, resulting in a significant expulsion of stubborn phlegm through several bowls and a day of deep sleep thereafter. Ginseng enters the Taiyin channel, replenishing the Yang within the Yin; whereas reed does the opposite, strongly draining the Yang of Taiyin. The girl&#39;s violent anger raised her qi; the Liver governs anger, the Lung governs qi, and with anger, the qi rebels. The wooden Liver overcomes the Lung&#39;s metal, leading to coughing and confusion. The combination of ginseng and reed effectively promotes vomiting, resolving phlegm and allowing the qi to descend, extinguishing the fire, restoring the metal qi, and harmonizing the stomach qi, bringing relief.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhao Litong, nearing fifty, was of weak constitution and often angry. In July, during a scorching heat, he suffered from severe hunger while requesting food at home, but as it couldn&#39;t be prepared quickly, he became very angry. Two days later, he developed retention issues and experienced thirst. He believed that mixing cold water with honey would quench his thirst quickly, and his retention gradually eased. After five to seven days, he summoned me. Upon checking, his pulse was slightly strong but not rapid, so I instructed him to stop the honey water. When thirsty, he was to take a decoction of ginseng and white atractylodes mixed with Yiyuan powder, and the retention continued to gradually improve. A week later, he felt very fatigued and began to burp. I recognized this was due to his prolonged retention leading to kidney deficiency, so I advised him to stick with the previous medication. However, the retention had not stopped yet, and he continued with the honey drink. After three days of this, the burping had not ceased. Others believed that the medicine was inappropriate and intended to add ginger to the drink. I said: “Tonifying medicines do not produce immediate effects, and aconite does not tonify the kidneys; taking it would surely be fatal.” They asked: “Could it be because of drinking too much cold water, leading to coldness?” I replied: “Under such sultry heat, drinking something cool is not cold; don’t doubt this too much. Wait a few days; the medicinal properties will take effect, and it will resolve itself.” Four days later, the burping stopped, and the retention was also stable.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

In the early autumn, he suffered from stagnation and reduced his food intake, leading to belching after five or seven days. He summoned me to examine him; his pulse was forceful and wide, which others deemed serious. I said, &quot;Those who are thin can still be treated.&quot; I prescribed a large tonic pill made with ginseng and white atractylodes to replenish his blood, and after seven days, he was stable.</p>
<p>Zhou Yue, who was over twenty years younger than Chen, developed a belching condition after running several miles following a heavy meal. He belched over a hundred times without stopping for half a day; drinking alcohol and soup did not trigger any belching. By evening, he developed a fever, and this lasted for two months.

Soon after, she bathed in water that was too hot to approach, which exacerbated her anger, causing her to feel faint and collapse. She covered herself with her clothes and went to her room. Shortly after, she began to cough violently; each cough made her body jolt, leading to further dizziness. This occurred every three to five breaths, and her pulse could not be diagnosed. I said: &quot;There is phlegm in the upper part of the body, and the anger has caused it to be stagnant. The hot phlegm is clashing, preventing qi from descending, so it must be expelled.&quot; At that time, it was midnight, and suddenly, someone happened to have two taels of ginseng and reed available.

They were treated with large doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, up to five applications, and through tonification, recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; mentions: My elder brother had recurring diarrhea for nine months, with over fifty bowel movements each night, vomiting food, and after five or six days became increasingly nauseous. I gave him a grain of clove to dissolve, which immediately stopped the nausea, but after a while, it returned. Therefore, I used the Huang Lian Xie Xin Decoction with added bamboo shavings to drink; although nausea lessened, the diarrhea remained unresolved. This persisted for over ten days, and so I used a small amount of polished rice husks to help absorb the excess fluid and during the day, I supplemented with white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel to nourish his deficiency. After taking the polished rice husks, the nausea gradually subsided, and the diarrhea also stabilized.</p>
<p>There was a patient recovering from a cold who suddenly developed nausea. I tried nearly all remedies for nausea known to ancient practitioners, but none worked. Out of desperation, I used powdered soap pod to blow into the nose, leading to a sneeze that stopped the nausea; however, it returned after a while, so I repeated the use of powdered soap pod, resulting in multiple sneezes that alleviated it for hundreds of times. Each sneeze led to increasing phlegm and mucus, which gradually cleared the nausea, and within two to three days, it stopped. This is a method that aligns with the principles of acupuncture and nasal sneezing, thus I record it here.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Taiyin condition manifests as abdominal distention, leading to difficulty in breathing, along with frequent belching and vomiting. 【Note: The foot Taiyin channel enters the abdomen corresponding to the spleen, thus causing abdominal distention. The hand Taiyin channel affects the diaphragm and is related to the lungs, hence the difficulty in breathing.

<p><strong>Discussion on Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>In the case of heart obstruction, the pulse does not flow smoothly, causing agitation that leads to a sensation of fullness below the heart, sudden upward rising qi, and dry throat with frequent belching. 【Note: When pathogenic factors obscure below the heart, it stirs and affects the heart, causing agitation; hence, agitation leads to fullness below the heart. Reversed qi suddenly rises, resulting in wheezing and a dry throat. The heart governs belching, and when heart qi reverses and exits, it leads to frequent belching.】</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Explanation Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyin condition, which is said to ascend to the heart as belching, arises from the abundance of yin that ascends to Yangming; since Yangming is linked to the heart, it is thus called ascending to the heart as belching. 【Note: Belching refers to the expulsion of qi. The qi of Taiyin ascends from Yangming and exits through the heart, resulting in belching.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Needle Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>Needling the center of the heart leads to death in one day, causing a reaction of belching. 【Note: When the heart is obstructed, it leads to belching; thus, if belching occurs, heart qi is exhausted.】</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The spleen&#39;s channel of the foot Taiyin manifests in several ways: when disturbed, it leads to a strong feeling in the root of the tongue, vomiting after eating, stomach pain, and abdominal bloating with frequent belching. </p>
<p>Note: The spleen, when in motion, affects Qi, which then influences the channels and organs, resulting in symptoms like a strong tongue, vomiting, pain, and bloating. Frequent belching indicates that spleen Qi is rising towards the heart. </p>
<p>The heart governs belching. </p>
<p>Note: Belching is the reverse Qi of the middle burner rising to the heart. </p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), the question arises: what does &quot;exhaustion of the upper jiao&quot; with belching mean? The master replies: the upper jiao receives Qi from the middle burner; if it is not harmonized, it cannot digest food, hence the belching. Exhaustion of the lower jiao results in loss of urine and stool, as Qi is unregulated and cannot be controlled. No treatment is necessary; it will resolve with time.</p>
<p>In treating belching, if there is heat and phlegm in the stomach, one should not take soft gypsum pills. Regarding the prescription, it states that belching with sour regurgitation is due to food stagnation combined with heat; this is related to the rising fire Qi. Use Huangqin as the main ingredient, and add Nanshen, Banxia, and Chenpi as assistants; if there is more heat, add Qingdai.</p>
<p>When phlegm-heat is present, with stagnant fire in the stomach and thick phlegm in the diaphragm due to dietary accumulation, it is necessary to expel phlegm-heat, using pills such as Runxia Wan and Guyu Lian Wan. </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Excessive qi leads to belching, which increases after eating; when the rancid qi is strong, it can cause more belching. This is often due to the harmful effects of dampness and heat from food. For treatment, use Erchen Decoction with added Cangzhu, Shenqu, Malt, stir-fried Huanglian, or Baohe Pills. If persistent belching is not related to diet, it is due to deficiency, caused by stagnant turbid qi in the stomach and damp phlegm in the diaphragm, both of which can lead to belching. For this, administer Liu Junzi Decoction with Chenxiang as the chief ingredient, Houpu and Suzi as officials, and Wuyu as a messenger; also consider Qinigunqi Pill or Suhexiang Pill; for severe cases, Ling Sha can be used to settle the condition.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: The stomach is the sea of food and drink, receiving all substances. If one indulges without restraint in damp, fishy, cold, or overly slippery foods, it results in a build-up of thick phlegm, causing a noisy stomach and symptoms like acid reflux, fullness, and, in severe cases, vomiting and obstruction in the diaphragm. This manifests as a sensation of hunger without hunger, pain without pain, and a state of distress causing unease. Symptoms may include belching, fullness, nausea, leading to pain in the stomach area, indicative of phlegm-fire accumulation. Treatment should focus on herbs like Nansheng, Banxia, and Ju Hong to dispel phlegm; Qinjie, Lian, Zhizhi, Shigao, and Zhimai to reduce fire; and Cangzhu, Baizhu, and Shaoyao to strengthen the spleen and resolve dampness, thereby reinforcing the fundamental essence. Additionally, it is essential to avoid certain foods and practice moderation without disregarding personal discomfort.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Key Points on Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Belching and Sourness</strong></p>
<p>Belching, swallowing sour air, and vomiting sour substance are caused by retained food. This is evidenced by symptoms in the middle abdomen: when there is fluid, it causes discomfort, and when there is retained food, it causes sourness. Belching and swallowing sour air, expelling rotten gas, and experiencing sour water reversing in the throat often manifest as spitting up clear sour water several times each morning. Some individuals may not experience this discomfort during the day, while others feel a consistent sour ache in the diaphragm. These issues are due to both the harm from food and a deficiency in the middle abdomen. The remedy is to use Pingwei Powder with equal parts shenqu and maiya, or alternatively, Bawei Pingwei Powder.</p>
<p><strong>Disharmony of Spleen and Stomach with Phlegm and Fire</strong></p>
<p>Danxi states that belching indicates the presence of phlegm and fire in the stomach. Chunfu believes that frequent belching is largely due to disharmony in the gastric qi, leading to blockage and discomfort. How can this be identified? Generally, after eating to fullness, people often expel gas since a full meal causes the stomach to feel uneasy. If belching occurs not long after meals, it suggests a deficiency in the stomach with resultant disharmony. While Danxi mentions phlegm and fire, it represents only one aspect of the condition.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;噫&quot; in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; corresponds to what is now called &quot;aerophagia&quot; or belching. The Five Qi Theory states that belching originates from the heart, while the theory of obstruction indicates that when the heart is blocked, the pulse does not flow smoothly, leading to sensations of fullness and labored breathing, accompanied by dryness in the throat and an inclination to belch. The &quot;Great Treatise on True Principles&quot; describes the role of the Taiyang in governing the heavens, while the recovery of the Shaoyin is associated with the occurrence of belching. The Four Seasons indicate that obstruction and counterflow treatment derived from piercing the center leads to death in one day and results in belching. The Yin-Yang Distinctions state that two Yangs and one Yin cause symptoms such as fright, back pain, a tendency to belch, and yawning; this is termed &quot;wind syncope.&quot; The Pulse Interpretation chapter discusses how the Taiyin relates to the heart through belching, indicating that when Yin is abundant and ascends to the Yangming, and since Yangming connects to the heart, it is said that this ascent relates to belching. This indicates that belching emanates from the heart. The Jueyin in the pulse reflects abdominal bloating and belching, with relief from gas leading to a sensation of lightness. The discussion of the Taiyin concludes that prolonged conditions result in frequent belching. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; mentions the Foot Taiyin as active in conditions like abdominal bloating and belching. It also notes that cold qi lodges in the stomach, causing counterflow upwards that leads to belching. Zhang Zhongjing argues that if the upper jiao receives unbalanced qi from the middle jiao, it cannot digest properly, resulting in belching. Furthermore, if the qi of the upper jiao does not return, it can lead to belching and sour regurgitation, indicating that when the qi does not reach its respective areas, digestion is obstructed, resulting in belching and sourness. Thus, belching is viewed as the qi of fire and earth being constrained and unable to vent, leading to its outward expression. Wang’s commentary on the meaning of the heart relating to belching likens it to fire&#39;s ascent, with smoke following the flames; similarly, when phlegm obstructs the diaphragm, the central qi cannot extend, resulting in belching, which is also a manifestation of internal earth qi being stagnant.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

In cold conditions, there will be pain in the lower back and spine, a dark face with dry ears, inability to eat due to belching, or possibly vomiting blood. ### Febrile Disease Symptoms A reverse cough is what Zhang Zhongjing referred to as belching. Belching arises from cold in the stomach. Febrile disease is fundamentally deficient; attacking its heat must lead to belching. Moreover, it is said that if a febrile disease leads to extreme vomiting and diarrhea, and sweating is induced again, the person will have water stagnating, and if water is given to bring forth sweat, belching will occur. This is due to the coldness in the stomach. The treatment involves using dried tangerine peel and ginger decoction, or a formula of Qiang Huo and Fu Zi, or a decoction of Ban Xia and ginger, or the Tui Yin San. If taking medicine does not heal, moxibustion will surely cure. The method: for women, bend the nipple down towards the bone in between, and moxibustion three times; for men and small-breasted individuals, take one finger as a measure. Position is important: men on the left, women on the right, burning moxa the size of a small bean directly above the pulsing artery midpoint. However, there are also those with a yang syndrome experiencing a reverse cough, treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang or tangerine peel and bamboo leaf decoction. Zhang Zhongjing also says: if belching occurs with abdominal fullness, by examining the front and back, one can discern which part is obstructed, and relieving that will lead to recovery. Zhang Zhongjing offers no specific formula. The front should use Zhu Ling Decoction, and the back should use Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Decoction. Bian Que's \"Zhong Cang Jing\" recommends for febrile cough and reverse cough, using the Clove Powder. Mix cloves and persimmon calyx each at one part, and licorice and ginger each at half a part; boil in hot water to form a dose, and consume it while hot for utmost efficacy."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"In Volume 11 of \"San Yin,\" there are also prescriptions such as Bamboo Rhizome Decoction and Clove Powder. Bamboo Rhizome Decoction treats Yang syndromes. In Volume 8 of \"Ben Shi Fang,\" for treating the symptoms of cold damage, there is a prescription for cough and counterflow with Cardamom Decoction. For treating Yin syndrome's cough and counterflow, medications like Clove, Fennel, and Nutmeg are used, while they are unsuitable for Yang syndromes. Coughing and counterflow often arise from initial heat followed by the intake of raw and cold substances or too many cooling medications, leading to conflicting Qi between Yin and Yang. A neighboring servant had a strong fever, and after using cooling medications excessively, experienced coughing and counterflow for four to five days. Eventually, only after taking Clove and Persimmon stem did they improve. Following that, they used Xiao Chai Hu for lingering heat and recovered afterwards, indicating that the fever was not fully resolved. For treating cold damage with cough and counterflow, two prescriptions were subsequently provided by Mr. Zhou from Huagai Mountain in Fuzhou. One is an emergency prescription: half a tael of Cyperus tuber and tangerine seed, finely shredded, fried together in half a cup of wine until the medicine turns a golden yellow, ground into a fine powder. Take two qian with a small cup of water, decoct it until down to eight parts, and sip it slowly. One formula uses only the powder of Cyperus, while another incorporates two cloves of garlic, sautéed and ground, mixed with white ginger powder, formed into pills the size of the seeds of the Wutong tree, and swallowed with the juice of Shao Cai in a dose of twenty pills. When the illness recedes, take another fifteen pills."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"**Ji Sheng Fang** **(Song Dynasty - Yan Yonghe)** **Discussion** The disease of coughing and reverse flow, upon careful examination of various texts, is not explicitly recorded. Only Master Sun mentions that there is no specific term for \"coughing and reverse flow\" in the discussions of herbal formulas, but that the ancients referred to it as \"coughing and reverse sounds.\" This often occurs after vomiting or purging, leading to a condition of emptiness and cold in the stomach, which gives rise to this symptom. There are also cases where stomach qi ascends with heat, resulting in coughing with eight or nine continuous sounds, where breath is unable to return. In such cases, one should carefully examine the pulse and symptoms and apply appropriate treatments. Generally, this condition is observed in the elderly, the weak, those suffering from prolonged illnesses, and women after childbirth. These are all signs of a deep-seated illness, not favorable omens."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"**The Theory of Ming** **(Jin Cheng Wujǐ)** **On the Treatment of Febrile Diseases** How can one clarify the signs of a febrile disease characterized by eructation? Eructation is commonly referred to as a reverse cough, which is characterized by a sound of gulping. If food obstructs the chest and throat, causing the qi to become blocked and unable to descend, there is no sound; this is purely a gastric disorder, albeit with varying degrees of severity. When there is a clash of vacuous cold and one drinks cold water, it induces a large sweating response; the cold qi clashes with the body, leading to eructation after consuming food, indicative of the depletion of gastric qi. After excessive vomiting and purging in cases of severe vacuity, if sweating recurs, it suggests the external qi is stagnant. If one then consumes water to induce sweating, it leads to eructation, which is due to the coldness in the stomach. Furthermore, if the stomach is vacuous and cold, making it unable to receive food, drinking water will also trigger eructation, indicating various gastric disorders. The classics mention: \"If the Fuyang pulse is floating, it indicates vacuity; if the Guan pulse is slippery, it indicates eructation.\" This suggests a medical fault, blaming the state of vacuity for the real issues at hand. In general, after excessive purging, if the qi in the stomach is reversed, it ultimately leads to eructation."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"The classics state: If one purges a phlegmatic patient too early, it will cause vomiting; if the stomach is originally weak and one attacks its heat, it will cause vomiting; and in cases of Yangming disease where one cannot eat, attacking the heat will surely cause vomiting. All of these situations occur due to the stomach being weak after purging. However, burping is primarily due to the cold water clashing against the stomach, thus one must use Minor Blue Dragon Decoction, removing Ephedra and adding Aconite. As for burping, it is also caused by the obstruction of heat, where qi cannot flow properly. If mild, it indicates a need for harmonization; if severe, it indicates a need for purging. The classics state: When there are tidal fevers accompanied by burping, correlating with Minor Chaihu Decoction, this is a sign of harmonization.

When a cold damage leads to burping, the illness has reached an extreme, unlike lighter conditions such as thirst or irritation. In cases of Sun Pattern Wind, where fire harms and causes sweating, both yin and yang are completely exhausted, leaving the body dry, with only head sweat coming, slightly returning to the neck, abdominal fullness, mild wheezing, dry mouth, and throat decay, and possibly no bowel movements—if prolonged, it leads to disorientation, and in severe cases to burping, indicating an extreme condition.

Later scholars, upon seeing the sections on the six disorders and whether to induce sweating or purging, noted that only 'a' is mentioned without reference to cough-reversal, thus labeling it as cough-reversal. Alas! This assertion originated from Master Sun, followed by discussions from Zhu and Cheng, which led to confusion over the definitions of the two terms.

For dry retching, 'a', or if there are symptoms of limb coldness, Orange Peel Decoction is indicated. For instances of 'a' and cough-reversal, Orange Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction is indicated. From this, it is clear that Zhang Zhongjing only identifies it among those similar to dry retching and does not reference cough-reversal.

Therefore, the mention of cough-reversal and 'a' implies a desire to expel something but with nothing being expelled, characterized by a harsh and potent sound, lasting until the breath is exhausted before ceasing, unlike the light and less intense nature of dry retching.

Ancient prescriptions always described this condition as a weakness of the stomach without addressing the fire, and treated it with remedies such as clove, persimmon stems, bamboo shavings, and dried citrus peel. It remains unclear which truly reduces fire and which compensates for emptiness. The yin qi of a person depends on the stomach for nourishment. When the stomach is damaged, the wood qi oppresses it, which is a matter of earth being defeated and wood being robbed. The yin is overrun by fire, unable to be contained internally; the wood, led by the fire, thus surges upward through the clear pathway. To say the stomach is weak means the yin is weak; if this weakness is severe, it may appear to be a critical condition. However, one must be mindful of actual deficiencies. For coughs with belching, weak qi, or yin fire, one should observe whether there is excess or deficiency to treat accordingly. For deficiency, use Ren Shen Bai Zhu Decoction or Major Tonifying Pill; for excess accompanied by phlegm, induce vomiting with Ren Shen and similar herbs.

In mild cases, it can be alleviated with harmonizing and dispersing methods; in severe cases, warming and dispersing measures are needed. If \"huò\" is accompanied by abdominal fullness and difficulty in defecation, first administer a half summer ginger decoction, then proceed with a small purgative.

The texts say: when the yang pulse is floating, it indicates obstruction; and when the pulse is slippery, it signifies a rough sound. This is a medical fault, blaming weakness for taking too much from the reality. There is also the possibility of heat qi being trapped, preventing the qi from circulating properly, which may cause a rough sound. For mild cases, harmonizing and promoting circulation may suffice; for severe cases, warmth and dispersion are necessary. If, on the other hand, there is no urination and the abdomen is distended, accompanied by a rough sound, and if there is a scattered pulse without coherence, even a divine physician may not be able to intervene effectively; this condition differs from that of cold damage with a rough sound and reversed qi. If one incorrectly attributes rough sounds and coughing to reversed qi, it would lead to great mistakes. Therefore, it is important to distinguish clearly when encountering illness. In cases with reversed coughing and little bowel movement, one should use the major purging decoction. This is due to heat qi colliding with the spleen and lungs.

There are different opinions among scholars; why do you alone adopt the views of Cheng and Xu? The meaning of “he” is clearly stated in the “Inner Canon,” but various schools overlook this. According to the end of the miscellaneous diseases chapter in the “Spiritual Pivot,” “he” is merely caused by a tickling sensation in the nose, leading to sneezing; there are methods that can suddenly stop it. Similarly, if one is startled, it can also be alleviated. Examining these three methods from the text reveals that they are indeed treatments for erni. For erni, pricking the nose with a piece of paper leads to sneezing, and the sneezing will immediately stop the erni; another method is to close the mouth and restrict the breathing to stop it; or one can use a great shock from a thief or robber to achieve the same result.

For instance, after sweating, vomiting, or purging due to a cold, and in cases of prolonged diarrhea or after a serious illness, or postpartum conditions in women, such symptoms arise from severe deficiency of the spleen and stomach qi and blood. If a healthy person eats too quickly, causing qi to get stuck, or if they drink water and laugh, leading to choking, or if phlegm-water obstructs the heart, or if anger causes qi to rebel and phlegm to ascend, or if it occurs post-illness due to heat without proper purging, all these are classified as excess conditions. Water is moist and descendent, while fire is hot and ascendant; if the qi is pushing upward from below, what else could it be but fire? Generally, the treatment for deficiency is to tonify it, but within deficiency, one must differentiate between cold and heat. If due to excessive consumption of cold after sweating, vomiting, or purging, it should be treated with warming tonics; if due to deficiency-heat from the spleen and stomach, it should be treated with harmonizing tonics; if heat is present, cool and tonify.

This indicates that coughing results in reversed qi, thus it is called \"reversed qi.\" It also mentions: \"When coughing and reversal worsen, blood may overflow.\""},{"anchor":"trans-29p","marker":"29p","type":"translation","text":"It is common for a condition where persistent cough and reverse flow of qi lead to blood, but it has not been heard of that coughing with reverse flow results in blood. Just as the Great Discussion on the Six Origins states: when there is metal distress, people suffering from cough with reverse flow relates to this notion. It is also clear that this cough is not the same as the reverse flow of qi. However, in later generations, some officials have defined reverse flow only as a type of cough, which shows they have not thoroughly examined the matter. Observing the words of Danxi, in \"Essentials Compilation,\" it is stated: Master Sun mistakenly identified reverse flow as a cough, indicating that reverse flow is not cough. In the \"Heart Methods Appendix,\" it is stated: cough with reverse flow means the ancient term was \"哕\" (huè), a recent term being \"呃\" (è), suggesting again that \"哕\" is indeed cough with reverse flow. The section on vomiting states: if there is sound and material, it is called vomiting; if there is sound without material, it is called \"哕.\" Thus, dry heaving is also categorized as \"哕.\" The inconsistencies here are quite mistaken! Furthermore, some officials from Haizang and Hejian view \"哕\" as dry heaving while considering cough with reverse flow as \"噫\" (yī), which is all erroneous."},{"anchor":"trans-30p","marker":"30p","type":"translation","text":"The act of nausea can be categorized into two types: when one vomits without any material, it is called \"nausea,\" and when one vomits with material, it is called \"vomiting.\" The condition of abdominal distension and belching is referred to as \"regurgitating,\" while the upward movement of qi from below is also called \"regurgitating.\" These four terms have distinct meanings and proper names; can they be confused in this way? Therefore, I analyze and clarify them: belching refers to the regurgitation of food, not a cough reflex. A severe cough reflex is referred to as a strong cough, not regurgitation. Dry heaving is empty vomiting, which is nausea, not belching. Regurgitating refers to the breath after a full meal, which is warm qi, not a cough reflex. If later generations take this as a guide, then the doubts arising from differing opinions can be resolved. The symptoms of regurgitation can be associated with typhoid fever or other mixed conditions; in ancient texts, they were all regarded as manifestations of cold deficiency. However, Danxi cites the Neijing, stating that all regurgitations that rise upward belong to fire. When patients exhibit this, it may seem like a critical condition. Yet, there are also cases of true excess that should not be overlooked."},{"anchor":"trans-31p","marker":"31p","type":"translation","text":"I once saw this statement and doubted that it contradicted ancient thinkers, thinking it incorrect, as I believed this evidence must pertain to the condition of coldness and not to actual heat. However, with my experiences in later years, I gained a definitive understanding and realized that Danxi's words were indeed not false. Although the distinctions between cold and heat, void and substance vary, the fundamental cause of a cough is always due to reversed Qi. When Qi is reversed from below, it rushes upward; without Qi, there is no cough, and without Yang, there is also no cough. Thus, the cause must be related to Qi. If one wishes to understand its manifestations, do we not witness thunder in the rain or splashing in the water? For Yang is obscured by Yin, giving rise to thunder, which roars unceasingly; this fire is the origin of thunder, and fire is precisely Qi. Similarly, Qi is concealed by water, giving rise to splashing, which flows continuously; this Qi is the origin of splashing, and Qi is indeed Yang. However, when the illness resides in the Qi aspect, it is not just one side; the primary causes of coughing are merely three: first, cold; second, heat; and third, deficiency and collapse. A cough from cold can be warmed or dispersed, and once the cold leaves, the Qi will naturally ease. A cough from heat can be lowered or cleared, and when the fire calms, the Qi will stabilize. Yet a cough arising from deficiency and collapse is indeed a perilous sign, and those who escape from it are exceedingly fortunate."},{"anchor":"trans-32p","marker":"32p","type":"translation","text":"### On Cough In cases of mixed symptoms of hiccup, although they arise from reversed qi, there are those with a combination of cold, those with a combination of heat, those due to food stagnation causing reversal, those due to qi stagnation causing reversal, those due to deficiency of the middle qi causing reversal, and those due to depletion of yin qi causing reversal. However, by observing the causes and treating the qi, there will be no cases that cannot be cured. If hiccups are mild or occur occasionally, and the qi is flowing smoothly, there is no need for treatment. Only when hiccups are frequent or severe must one consider that the qi is greatly reversed, or there is significant depletion of the spleen and kidney's vital energy. Actual patterns of symptoms are not difficult to treat, but depletion of the vital energy is the most dangerous condition. When cold stagnation causes hiccups, it might be due to wind-cold, consumption of raw or cold foods, or the inherent cold nature of the internal organs that occasionally leads to reversal. In such cases, removing the obstruction and suppressing the cold will stop the hiccup. Suitable remedies include tangerine peel soup, San Yin clove powder, or Er Chen decoction with five to seven slices of fresh ginger, or combined with other formulas such as Guanjian decoction or licorice and dried ginger soup, or tangerine peel and dried ginger soup. When the cold is severe, use Jiangshui powder or Si Ni decoction."},{"anchor":"trans-33p","marker":"33p","type":"translation","text":"Stomach fire causes hiccups, and its symptoms are quite numerous. However, upon examining the pulse, if it is slippery and solid while the body is not deficient in energy, and there is stagnation in the chest and diaphragm, or if the stools are hard or do not pass, it indicates that there is fire in the stomach, which causes the hiccups. By reducing this fire, the hiccups will naturally stop, and using “An Wei Drink” is most effective. I have cured many people with these symptoms. For hiccups accompanied by bloating due to qi counterflow, it is advisable to use a modified Er Chen Decoction with added Wu Yao, or Baoguan Dingxiang Shidi Powder, or Qiang Huo Fu Zi Decoction, or Shen Xiang Powder. If hiccups are caused by food stagnation, one should use a modified Er Chen Decoction with added Hawthorn, White Mustard Seed, and Wu Yao, or employ Da He Zhong Drink with added Dried Ginger and Mu Xiang. For those with deficiency cold in the middle burner (spleen and stomach) and hiccups caused by qi counterflow, one should use a modified Li Zhong Decoction with added Dingxiang, or Warm Stomach Drink with Dingxiang. If hiccups are a result of internal injury from overwork and fatigue, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Dingxiang. Generally, severe cold in the middle burner stems from deficiency in spleen and stomach qi. If the spleen and stomach are not deficient, then the cold will not be severe; hence, when treating cold, the focus should be on spleen qi. If there is no heat present, ingredients like Fresh Ginger, Ban Xia, Dingxiang, Shidi, Bai Zhu, and Cinnamon can be used. After vomiting or purging when the stomach qi is slightly deficient, or if hiccups are accompanied by heat in the diaphragm, one should use Tangerine Peel and Bamboo Shavings Decoction suitably. For deficiency cold in the lower burner, the liver and kidney’s ability to produce vital energy is impaired, hence hiccups are commonly seen in weak individuals due to insufficient original yang, which is easily suppressed."},{"anchor":"trans-34p","marker":"34p","type":"translation","text":"The root of this nausea mainly lies in the kidneys; therefore, I formulate the Guiqi Decoction to address it, which is quite effective. Some use the Li Yin Decoction with added clove to disperse the qi, and it is also excellent. In cases following severe illness, or those who are extremely thin and weak, or who suffer from weakness due to overexertion leading to nausea, this is the most critical condition. If the deficiency within is noted, one should promptly nourish the spleen; if it is a deficiency of yin, one should promptly nourish the kidneys. The first two methods are indeed firm, yet if there is still concern, then one should resort to great tonifying formulas like the Yuan Decoction and the You Gui Decoction, which may be the best options. In cases of nausea, if the voice is strong and the energy is robust with a slippery and full pulse, one generally should clear it down; if the voice is small and the breath slight with a weak pulse, one generally should warm and tonify. For nausea due to exterior cold, it ultimately is another manifestation of qi counterflow, which may differ from mixed conditions, as mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing regarding its categories. However, if there are still things unclarified or treatments insufficient, I will briefly mention them as follows. In cases of cold in the stomach due to external cold, conditions are generally similar to the previous mixed conditions and should be treated as mentioned before with warming and middle-regulating remedies. If the stomach is cold and drinking water leads to nausea, then it should be treated according to Zhang Zhongjing’s methods. If the pathogen resides in the exterior, it has no relation to the interior, thus there is no nausea."},{"anchor":"trans-35p","marker":"35p","type":"translation","text":"If the evil of lesser yang is located between the half exterior and half interior, resulting in alternating chills and fever along with qi being hindered leading to hiccups, it can be treated with Chai-Chen decoction. If accompanied by cold, add cloves; if with heat, add Huangqin; or Xiao-Chai-Hu decoction may also be appropriate. In cases of cold damage causing downward obstruction, if the evil enters the upright yangming and internal heat reaches its extreme, with the three burners dried up, the vaginal discharge ceased, and hiccups arising due to upward qi rebellion, it is essential to clear the heat and remove the obstruction, so that the rebellious qi can descend and thus alleviate the hiccups. However, it is crucial to carefully assess the severity of the evil: if there are no solid distension symptoms, only dryness and heat, then Bai-Hu decoction or Zhu-ye-Shi-Gao decoction, or Xie-Xin decoction to cool and resolve should be used; if there is indeed dry feces constipation and solid distension, then San-Cheng-Qi decoction should be administered. In cases of cold damage where the evil has not yet dispersed, using too much warming and tonifying treatments can cause the middle burner qi to rebel, which can especially lead to hiccups; in such cases, Anwei drink is the best remedy. If there is rebellious qi without fire, then use Ju-Pi decoction; if there is simultaneous exterior evil unresolved, then Chai-Chen decoction is appropriate. In situations where cold damage is mistakenly attacked, whether by vomiting, purging, or wrongly using cold cooling methods, leading to severe deficiency and cold of the spleen, kidneys, and stomach, which causes hiccups, it becomes a critical condition. Immediate adjustment using methods that warm the stomach and regulate yin is needed, for delay may render the situation irreparable. Observing Zhang Zihe's method of vomiting can also treat hiccups, as it can allow the qi to extend and disperse when it is stagnant. Therefore, for cases of fullness and stagnation, Zhang Zihe's method is indeed applicable."},{"anchor":"trans-36p","marker":"36p","type":"translation","text":"**Secret Method of the Stone Chamber** **By Chen Shiduo, Qing Dynasty** **Discussion on Treatment Method** When the qi is disturbed and cannot rise, it is in a state of stagnation.

Initially, this is beneficial, and it should not be viewed alongside the dispersed kinds. When water qi overwhelms the heart protector's network, there is persistent belching, which is a sign of impending death. However, I believe it can be salvaged because the heart protector is overwhelmed by water qi, and there is concern about the heart being harmed. Therefore, persistent belching occurs because it seeks to summon the qi of the five organs to jointly rescue the heart threatened by water qi. As water qi overwhelms the heart protector, leading to belching symptoms, it is essential to merely disperse the dampness of water qi, and the belching will cease naturally. To stop belching, use the following decoction: one tael each of Poria and Job's tears; three qian each of Atractylodes, White Atractylodes, and Ginseng; five qian of Foxnut; one qian each of Pinellia and dried tangerine peel; five fen of Clove; and three fen of the fruit of Evodia.

A physician diagnosed that this illness often makes one want to cry to feel relief. The woman confirmed this, stating it happens frequently but she did not understand why. The physician explained that the Shaoyang fire was attacking the Lung metal, which was weakened by the fire, causing a lack of expression.

It was determined that phlegm was present above the diaphragm, anger was repressed, and the heat from phlegm clashed, obstructing the qi from descending, making vomiting necessary. A decoction of ginseng and reed was prescribed, resulting in a significant expulsion of stubborn phlegm through several bowls and a day of deep sleep thereafter. Ginseng enters the Taiyin channel, replenishing the Yang within the Yin; whereas reed does the opposite, strongly draining the Yang of Taiyin. The girl's violent anger raised her qi; the Liver governs anger, the Lung governs qi, and with anger, the qi rebels. The wooden Liver overcomes the Lung's metal, leading to coughing and confusion.

Note: The spleen, when in motion, affects Qi, which then influences the channels and organs, resulting in symptoms like a strong tongue, vomiting, pain, and bloating. Frequent belching indicates that spleen Qi is rising towards the heart. The heart governs belching. Note: Belching is the reverse Qi of the middle burner rising to the heart. Regarding the symptoms of the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), the question arises: what does \"exhaustion of the upper jiao\" with belching mean? The master replies: the upper jiao receives Qi from the middle burner; if it is not harmonized, it cannot digest food, hence the belching. Exhaustion of the lower jiao results in loss of urine and stool, as Qi is unregulated and cannot be controlled. No treatment is necessary; it will resolve with time. In treating belching, if there is heat and phlegm in the stomach, one should not take soft gypsum pills. Regarding the prescription, it states that belching with sour regurgitation is due to food stagnation combined with heat; this is related to the rising fire Qi. Use Huangqin as the main ingredient, and add Nanshen, Banxia, and Chenpi as assistants; if there is more heat, add Qingdai. When phlegm-heat is present, with stagnant fire in the stomach and thick phlegm in the diaphragm due to dietary accumulation, it is necessary to expel phlegm-heat, using pills such as Runxia Wan and Guyu Lian Wan.

This is often due to the harmful effects of dampness and heat from food. For treatment, use Erchen Decoction with added Cangzhu, Shenqu, Malt, stir-fried Huanglian, or Baohe Pills. If persistent belching is not related to diet, it is due to deficiency, caused by stagnant turbid qi in the stomach and damp phlegm in the diaphragm, both of which can lead to belching. For this, administer Liu Junzi Decoction with Chenxiang as the chief ingredient, Houpu and Suzi as officials, and Wuyu as a messenger; also consider Qinigunqi Pill or Suhexiang Pill; for severe cases, Ling Sha can be used to settle the condition. **General Discussion** The \"Neijing\" states: The stomach is the sea of food and drink, receiving all substances. If one indulges without restraint in damp, fishy, cold, or overly slippery foods, it results in a build-up of thick phlegm, causing a noisy stomach and symptoms like acid reflux, fullness, and, in severe cases, vomiting and obstruction in the diaphragm. This manifests as a sensation of hunger without hunger, pain without pain, and a state of distress causing unease. Symptoms may include belching, fullness, nausea, leading to pain in the stomach area, indicative of phlegm-fire accumulation. Treatment should focus on herbs like Nansheng, Banxia, and Ju Hong to dispel phlegm; Qinjie, Lian, Zhizhi, Shigao, and Zhimai to reduce fire; and Cangzhu, Baizhu, and Shaoyao to strengthen the spleen and resolve dampness, thereby reinforcing the fundamental essence.

This is evidenced by symptoms in the middle abdomen: when there is fluid, it causes discomfort, and when there is retained food, it causes sourness. Belching and swallowing sour air, expelling rotten gas, and experiencing sour water reversing in the throat often manifest as spitting up clear sour water several times each morning. Some individuals may not experience this discomfort during the day, while others feel a consistent sour ache in the diaphragm. These issues are due to both the harm from food and a deficiency in the middle abdomen. The remedy is to use Pingwei Powder with equal parts shenqu and maiya, or alternatively, Bawei Pingwei Powder. **Disharmony of Spleen and Stomach with Phlegm and Fire** Danxi states that belching indicates the presence of phlegm and fire in the stomach. Chunfu believes that frequent belching is largely due to disharmony in the gastric qi, leading to blockage and discomfort. How can this be identified? Generally, after eating to fullness, people often expel gas since a full meal causes the stomach to feel uneasy. If belching occurs not long after meals, it suggests a deficiency in the stomach with resultant disharmony. While Danxi mentions phlegm and fire, it represents only one aspect of the condition."},{"anchor":"trans-58p","marker":"58p","type":"translation","text":"**Summary** The term \"噫\" in the \"Inner Canon\" corresponds to what is now called \"aerophagia\" or belching. The Five Qi Theory states that belching originates from the heart, while the theory of obstruction indicates that when the heart is blocked, the pulse does not flow smoothly, leading to sensations of fullness and labored breathing, accompanied by dryness in the throat and an inclination to belch. The \"Great Treatise on True Principles\" describes the role of the Taiyang in governing the heavens, while the recovery of the Shaoyin is associated with the occurrence of belching. The Four Seasons indicate that obstruction and counterflow treatment derived from piercing the center leads to death in one day and results in belching. The Yin-Yang Distinctions state that two Yangs and one Yin cause symptoms such as fright, back pain, a tendency to belch, and yawning; this is termed \"wind syncope.\" The Pulse Interpretation chapter discusses how the Taiyin relates to the heart through belching, indicating that when Yin is abundant and ascends to the Yangming, and since Yangming connects to the heart, it is said that this ascent relates to belching. This indicates that belching emanates from the heart. The Jueyin in the pulse reflects abdominal bloating and belching, with relief from gas leading to a sensation of lightness. The discussion of the Taiyin concludes that prolonged conditions result in frequent belching. The \"Spiritual Pivot\" mentions the Foot Taiyin as active in conditions like abdominal bloating and belching. It also notes that cold qi lodges in the stomach, causing counterflow upwards that leads to belching. Zhang Zhongjing argues that if the upper jiao receives unbalanced qi from the middle jiao, it cannot digest properly, resulting in belching. Furthermore, if the qi of the upper jiao does not return, it can lead to belching and sour regurgitation, indicating that when the qi does not reach its respective areas, digestion is obstructed, resulting in belching and sourness. Thus, belching is viewed as the qi of fire and earth being constrained and unable to vent, leading to its outward expression. Wang’s commentary on the meaning of the heart relating to belching likens it to fire's ascent, with smoke following the flames; similarly, when phlegm obstructs the diaphragm, the central qi cannot extend, resulting in belching, which is also a manifestation of internal earth qi being stagnant."},{"anchor":"trans-59p","marker":"59p","type":"translation","text":"**Recipe for Betel Nut Powder** For treating cold spleen causing undigested food, fatigue, bloating, discomfort, and unhappiness: Take eight betel nuts, skin intact; two taels each of ginseng, poria, aged barley, thick-fleshed, wheat germ, evodia, and white atractylodes.

咳逆之名，原出《内经》，本以咳嗽气逆者为言。如气交变大论曰：岁金太过，甚则喘咳逆气。此因喘咳以致气逆，故云咳逆气也。又曰：欬逆甚而血溢。"},{"anchor":"orig-29p","marker":"29p","type":"original","text":"正以咳逆不止而血随气溢，则病之常也，未闻以呃逆而见血者也。即如六元正纪大论云；金郁之发，民病咳逆者，亦是此意。此欬逆之非呃逆，亦甚明矣。而今后世诸公乃悉以哕为咳逆，岂皆未之详察耶？及观丹溪之言，在《纂要》则曰：孙真人误以哕为咳逆，是谓哕非咳逆也。在《心法附录》则曰：咳逆为病，古谓之哕，近谓之呃，此又谓哕即咳逆也。在呕吐门则又曰：有声有物谓之呕吐，有声无物谓之哕，此又以干呕为哕也。前后不一，何其自谬若此！再如海藏、河间诸公，有以哕为干呕者，有以咳逆为噫者，总皆谬矣。"},{"anchor":"orig-30p","marker":"30p","type":"original","text":"盖呕即吐之类，但吐而无物者曰呕，呕而有物者曰吐；腹胀嗳气者曰噫，逆气自下而上者亦曰噫。此四者之辨，自有正名，顾可纷纷若是乎？兹余析而判之曰：哕者呃逆也，非咳逆也。欬逆者，欬嗽之甚者也，非呃逆也。干呕者，无物之吐即呕也，非哕也。噫者，饱食之息，即暧气也，非咳逆也。后人但以此为鉴，则异说之疑可尽释矣。
