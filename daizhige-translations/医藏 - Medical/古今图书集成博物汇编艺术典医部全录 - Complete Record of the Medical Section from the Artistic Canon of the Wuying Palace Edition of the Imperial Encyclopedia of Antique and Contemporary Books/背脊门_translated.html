<p><strong>Back and Spine Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>The back represents Yang, and within Yang, it is the essence of Yang, which is the heart. The back represents Yang, and within Yin, it is the essence of Yin, which is the lungs. 【Note: The heart is a Yang organ located in the upper burner, thus it is the essence of Yang. The lungs are a Yin organ also located in the upper burner, thus they are the essence of Yin.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When two Yang and one Yin give rise to illness, it leads to fright, back pain, frequent yawning, and frequent sighing, known as wind syncope. 【Note: Two Yang and one Yin refer to the conditions of Yangming and Jueyin. The back represents Yang, and Jueyin governs the spring Yang Liver Wood, hence it causes back pain.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The back is the organ of the chest; when the back curves, the shoulders follow, indicating the organs may be failing. 【Note: Shoulders and back are Yang, while the chest and abdomen are Yin. Yang pertains to organs, while Yin pertains to the viscera. The heart and lungs reside in the chest, and their acupoints correspond to the shoulders and back, hence the back is considered an organ of the chest.**<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the True Discomfort of the Jade Machine</strong></p>
<p>In winter, if the pulse is excessive, it leads to discomfort (and irritability), pain in the spine, and a lack of energy, making one reluctant to speak; if it is insufficient, it causes a feeling of anxiety as if suffering from hunger, coldness in the middle, pain in the spine, fullness in the lower abdomen, and changes in urination. 【Note: The kidneys are the source of vital energy and govern closure and storage. If excessive, energy leaks out, harming the foundation, leading to lethargy and reduced energy. Insufficient yang energy causes pain in the spine. The heart governs speech, and since the root energy is damaged, one loses the desire to speak. If the pulse is insufficient, the interaction of water and fire energies between the heart and kidneys is compromised, leading to a feeling of anxiety similar to that of hunger. In the coldness of the middle, at the end of the rib bones above the kidneys, the deficiency of kidney yang causes this coldness. The kidneys are connected to the bladder; if the kidneys are weak, they cannot transform properly, leading to changes in urination and fullness in the lower abdomen.】 </p>
<p>In spring, if the pulse is insufficient, it causes chest pain that radiates to the back, and fullness in both sides below. 【Note: The yang energy of spring wood arises from the yin of the kidney water. The deficiency of yin energy results in insufficient yang, leading to chest pain radiating to the back. The sides are the area of the liver and kidneys; when the vital energy is deficient and cannot express outwardly, it results in internal fullness.】 </p>
<p>In autumn, if the pulse is excessive, it leads to rebellious qi and back pain with irritation. 【Note: The lungs govern the qi of the entire body; excessive energy results in rebellion outward, leading to back pain. The lung&#39;s acupoint is located at the shoulder and back.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Principles of Qi and Pathology</h3>
<p>For those with heart ailments, there is pain in the chest, fullness in the sides, pain below the ribs, pain between the shoulder blades, and pain in the inner arms.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The pathway of the Heart Channel (hand Shaoyin) begins in the heart, runs upward alongside the throat, exits beneath the ribs, follows the inner arm down to the middle of the elbow, and continues along the inner side of the arm. The pathway of the Small Intestine Channel (hand Shaoyang) ascends the upper arm, follows the inner shoulder, exits at the shoulder joint, and circles around the shoulder blade. When these two channels are filled with qi, pain results. Fullness in the sides is due to the branches of the Shaoyin being filled and causing pain below the ribs.</p>
<p>For those with lung ailments, symptoms include wheezing, coughing, and reversed qi, along with pain in the shoulders and back, profuse sweating, and pain in the buttocks, thighs, knees, and feet.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The lungs govern qi and derive their origin from the kidneys; the kidneys are the root, and the lungs are the branch. The qi of the mother and son channels is interconnected. Therefore, the pathway of the Foot Shaoyin channel runs directly from the kidneys, penetrating the diaphragm, entering the lungs, and circling the throat, alongside the base of the tongue. When this qi is disrupted, it causes wheezing and coughing. The lung&#39;s acupuncture point is in the shoulder and back area; when qi is reversed upwards, it causes pain in the shoulders and back, leading to sweating; when reversed downwards, it causes pain in the buttocks, thighs, knees, etc.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Chapter on Blood and Qi</strong></p>
<p>To understand the points on the back, first measure the space between the two nipples. Then use another piece of grass to measure this space, halving it, and use the two ends as supports. Next, position this measurement to assess the back, ensuring one end is above, aligned with the spinal prominence, while the two ends below align with the lower end, which corresponds to the Lung point.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: This discussion pertains to the method of identifying five points. The points associated with the five organs are all located on the back, as the back is the hollow of the chest. Therefore, the measurement of the two nipples is first established before determining the points on the back. By using grass to measure the distance between the nipples and halving this, we create three key points: one above aligned with the spinal prominence, and two below that support the lower end, which represents the Lung point.]</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>On Malaria</strong></p>
<p>Evil qi enters the Wind Palace, descends along the body, and the protective qi gathers in the Wind Palace for a day and night. The next day, it descends to a certain level; therefore, it manifests later. This first affects the back. [Note: This indicates that the evil originates in the Wind Palace and affects the spaces in the back, which leads to an early or delayed onset of illness.] When it strikes the back, the qi reaches the back and causes illness. [Note: When it strikes the back, the evil resides in the spaces of the back. The protective qi encounters the evil, hence the onset of illness.]</p>
<p><strong>On Pain</strong></p>
<p>When cold qi invades the pulses at the back acu-points, the pulse becomes weak. A weak pulse leads to deficient blood, and deficient blood results in pain. Because the back is associated with the heart, they reinforce each other, causing pain. Pressing on it brings forth heat, and when heat arrives, the pain stops. [Note: The pulses at the back acu-points refer to the Foot Taiyang pulse, which runs along the back, with the five organs and six bowels associated with the Taiyang meridian, hence it is called the back pulse. The blood and qi of the organs converge at the acu-points, so when cold invades, the pulse weakens, leading to blood deficiency, and thus, pain arises.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>The condition of kidney wind is characterized by back pain that prevents one from standing upright.<br><em>Note: The kidney governs the bones; therefore, back pain prevents upright posture.</em></p>
<h3>Treatise on Pulses</h3>
<p>The so-called &quot;strongly pulling upward&quot; of the taiyang (greater yang) is due to the yang energy rising vigorously and contending, hence it is strongly pulling upward.<br><em>Note: The strong upward pull refers to the head and neck being tense, pulling towards the shoulders and back. The pulse of the taiyang ascends from the forehead to the crown, diverging from the crown to the nape, and pressing against the lower back, with the yang energy being vigorous and agitated above, causing the strong upward pull.</em></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Qi Office</h3>
<p>The governor vessel emerges from the large vertebra at the base of the neck down to the tailbone and the fifteen points at its sides, reaching the sacrum, encompassing a total of twenty-one segments, pertaining to the spinal vertebrae.<br><em>Note: From the large vertebra to the tailbone is measured as thirteen points, plus the two adjacent points, totaling fifteen points. The large vertebra is located at the prominent bony area at the back of the neck, with the Tao Dao located between the large vertebra and the segment below, the Shen Dao located between the fifth and sixth segments, Ling Tai between the sixth and seventh segments, Zhi Yang between the seventh and eighth segments, Jin Suo between the eighth and ninth segments, Zhong Gu between the eleventh and twelfth segments, Xuan Shu between the thirteenth and fourteenth segments, Ming Men between the fourteenth and fifteenth segments, Yang Guan between the sixteenth and seventeenth segments, Yao Shu between the twenty-first segment, Chang Qiang at the end of the sacrum, and Hui Yang at both sides of the tailbone, belonging to the taiyang bladder meridian. From the large vertebra to the sacrum comprises a total of twenty-one segments, plus the three segments above the neck, making a total of twenty-four segments, which is said to correspond to the twenty-four qi.</em><a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Symptoms and Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Spleen diseases cause body pain and heaviness. On the first day, there is bloating; on the second day, pain in the lower abdomen, waist, spine, and aching limbs; on the third day, pain in the back (muscles) and urinary blockage. If this continues for ten days, death ensues. In winter, people become stable; in summer, they eat late. </p>
<p><em>Note: When the disease first affects the spleen, body pain and heaviness occur. On the first day, it affects the stomach, leading to bloating. On the second day, it affects the kidneys, resulting in pain in the lower abdomen, waist, spine, and aching limbs. On the third day, it affects the bladder, causing back pain (muscles) and urinary blockage, and if this persists for ten days, death follows. Ma Shi states: in winter, stability lies during the pig hour, signifying the decline of earth and the dominance of water; in summer, late eating occurs during the tiger hour, where wood flourishes and earth is exhausted.</em>*</p>
<p>Kidney diseases also result in pain in the lower abdomen, waist, and spine, with aching limbs. After three days, back pain (muscles) and urinary blockage occur. After three days, abdominal bloating arises, and after three days, there is pain in both sides of the body. If it continues for three days, death ensues. In winter, it occurs early in the morning; in summer, it occurs late in the afternoon.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The illness first manifests in the kidneys, leading to pain in the lower abdomen and lower back, followed by pain in the shoulders and bladder, and then difficulty in urination after three days. After another three days, the stomach will experience bloating, and after three days, pain will occur in the liver and sides. In winter, the major bright period is at Chen; the earth is strong and the water is subdued. In summer, the end of the day is at Hai; the water is exhausted and cannot nurture anything.</p>
<p>In the case of stomach illness, there is bloating and heaviness, with pain in the lower abdomen and lower back after five days, and after three days, pain in the shoulders and difficulty in urination. After five days, the body feels heavy, and if it continues for six days, it leads to death. After midnight in winter, the earth weakens and the water dominates. During the brilliant summer day, it is the time governed by Yangming, where the earth is exhausted and cannot produce. </p>
<p>The illness first manifests in the stomach, hence the bloating occurs. After five days, it affects the kidneys, causing pain in the lower abdomen and lower back, and after three days, it moves to the bladder, resulting in shoulder pain and difficulty in urination. After five days, it reaches the spleen, leading to a heavy body, and if it persists for another six days, it results in death. After midnight in winter, the earth is defeated and water triumphs. In the summer sun, it is a time when Yangming is in control, leading to the collapse of earth and the inability to generate life.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The Classic of the Sinews</p>
<p>The Treatise on the Disease Forms of the Organs and Viscera due to Evil Qi</p>
<p>When evil qi enters a person, it rides upon the void, penetrating the chest and back, as well as the sides. [Note: The collateral of the three yang channels of the hands and feet all ascend from the neck to the head and face. The chest and back, as well as the sides, also follow from the head and neck down to the chest and shoulders.] When the heart pulse is slightly rapid, it leads to heart pain radiating to the back; if it is slightly large, it leads to heart obstruction radiating to the back, accompanied by profuse tears. [Note: Various rapid pulses represent cold, while the heart is the organ of fire. Slight cold merely affects the boundaries of the heart, thus causing heart pain that radiates to the back; if more pronounced, it becomes excessive; slight excess reverses below the heart, leading to heart obstruction radiating to the back, causing the heart essence to rise with the qi to the eyes, resulting in tears.] When the lung pulse is slightly rapid, it indicates lung cold heat, laziness, coughing up blood, and radiating to the lower back, chest, and if there are nasal polyps, nasal obstruction; when slightly large, it indicates lung obstruction, radiating to the chest and back, causing aversion to sunlight. [Note: Lung cold heat refers to cold or heat on the skin. Cold on the skin results in slight rapidity. The lungs govern qi; thus, laziness and coughing up blood radiate to the lower back, chest, and nose, as if there were polyps causing obstruction, all due to deficiency and cold of lung qi. When qi is mildly excessive above, it indicates lung obstruction radiating to the chest and back, as the qi rises from below. With diminished yin blood, there is an aversion to sunlight, as metal fears fire.] When the kidney pulse is markedly slow, it leads to a bent spine.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Governing Vessel is associated with the kidneys and runs along the spine. If it becomes relaxed, the spine may become bent.</p>
<p>The Bladder channel of the Foot Taiyang causes headaches when in motion, with symptoms such as feeling like the eyes are popping out, neck tension, back pain, a feeling of fracture in the waist, inability to bend the thigh, knots in the knees, and splitting pain in the ankles, which leads to ankle cramping. This channel governs diseases related to tendons, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, mania, headaches in the temples and neck, yellowing of the eyes with tears, nosebleeds, and pain in the neck, back, waist, buttocks, knees, and feet, to the point that the little toe is unusable. </p>
<p>The Taiyang energy stems from the water of the Bladder, making it the governing energy of all Yang. The gentle quality of Yang nurtures the tendons, hence the diseases related to the tendons manifest as hemorrhoids. If the channels sink and are thin, it results in malaria, while reverse flow downwards leads to epilepsy and mania. Symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, eye issues, back and knee pain are all conditions resulting from pathways in the channels. </p>
<p>The Foot Shaoyin channel runs along the spine and is associated with the kidneys, connecting to the Bladder. The differentiation of the Governing Vessel is termed &quot;Changqiang,&quot; which runs alongside the spine up to the neck and is situated between the shoulder blades; when it is full, the spine is strong.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on Meridians and Tendons</strong></p>
<p>The tendons of the Foot Taiyin attach to the spine. Their disorders cause pain radiating down to the navel, pain in the flanks, and pain within the spine. The tendons of the Foot Shaoyin run along the spine, hugging the spleen, rising to the nape, and joining with the tendons of the Foot Taiyang.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Bone Measurements</strong></p>
<p>From the hairline at the nape down to the vertebrae of the back measures two and a half inches; from the lumbar vertebra down to the sacrum, there are twenty-one segments measuring three feet in total. Each of the upper segments measures one inch and four and one-fourth tenths. The peculiar fraction is counted at the bottom; thus, the seven segments above the lumbar vertebra measure seven inches and nine tenths. </p>
<p>[Note: This is the measurement of the bones of the spine. The distance from the nape down to the vertebrae of the back, measured from the hairline at the back of the head to the largest vertebra of the back, is two and five-tenths inches long. The lumbar vertebra is the spinal vertebra. From the largest vertebra of the back, tracing down along the lumbar vertebra to the sacrum, there are twenty-one segments totaling three feet in length. Each upper segment measures one inch and four-tenths of a cent, with the peculiar fraction of nine-tenths counted at the lower segment. Thus, counting the segments above the lumbar vertebra, there are seven segments each measuring one inch and four-tenths of a cent, so seven make seven inches and four to seven make eight-tenths, totaling nine inches and eight-tenths. Moreover, each segment adds one-tenth, yielding a total of nine inches, eight-tenths and seven-tenths, hence saying seven-tenths of nine inches and eight-tenths.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Nutritional Qi</strong></p>
<p>Nutritional Qi circulates from the spine down to the tailbone; it also moves through the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), enters the gallbladder, and radiates out to the flanks, continuing to circulate through the spine into the sacrum.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Epilepsy and Madness</strong><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The onset of madness begins with stiffness, leading to pain in the spine.<br>[Note: Pain in the spine indicates that cold qi has settled in the earth. The spine refers to the back. The Book of Changes states: &quot;Stabilize the back; stability is like a mountain, stopping and not moving, thereby becoming the high elevation of Kun.&quot;]</p>
<p>Heart pain is related to the back.<br>[Note: The back is yang, and the heart is the sun among the yang, hence the correspondence and resultant pain between the heart and back.]</p>
<p>When yin and yang are not in harmony, fluids overflow and flow downward into the yin, causing both marrow and fluids to be depleted and descend. Excessive descent leads to deficiency, resulting in pain in the lower back and soreness in the shins.<br>[Note: The disharmony of yin and yang refers specifically to the imbalance between the lesser yin and the greater yang. When the energies of yin and yang are not harmonious, the fluids and essence do not unify, causing the fluids to overflow outside the bones and downward into the yin. When fluids overflow outward, both marrow and fluids decrease and descend, leading to an inability to rise. Excessive downward flow results in weak bones, causing pain in the lower back and soreness in the shins.]</p>
<p>Those with thick shoulders and backs have strong lungs, while those with thin shoulders and backs have brittle lungs. A thick back indicates proper lung alignment, whereas a sparse side indicates a tilted lung.<br>[Note: The lungs reside within the shoulders and chest, thus observing the shoulders and back reveals the status of the lungs&#39; strength and alignment. As Ni Chong stated: The lungs belong to heaven, covered by a canopy above; the back is yang and shapes the body above, hence the lung points are located at the shoulders and back.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Back Shu Points</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: &quot;I wish to understand the Back Shu points of the five zang organs.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The great shu point of the back is located at the end of the blade bone; the lung shu is between the three jiao; the heart shu is between the five jiao; the diaphragm shu is between the seven jiao; the liver shu is between the nine jiao; the spleen shu is between the eleven jiao; the kidney shu is between the fourteen jiao. Each point is located three cun away from the spine. To validate their efficacy, press on these locations. If you feel pain and it relieves the tension at the center, then that is the shu point.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: &quot;Jiao&quot; refers to the vertebrae where the spinal joints intersect, along which the Governing Vessel runs. The great shu is on either side of the first vertebra. By first mentioning the great shu when asking about the five zang, it refers to the apex of the bone at the back of the neck, where the Governing Vessel runs along the first vertebra of the spine.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The source of the Foot Shaoyin is located three cun above the inner ankle, marked by the back shu and the two meridians beneath the tongue. The source of the Foot Jueyin is at five cun above the interspace, marked by the back shu. The source of the Foot Taiyin is four cun above the center of the Zhongfeng point, marked by the back shu and the root of the tongue. The source of the Hand Shaoyin is at the tip of the wrist bone, marked by the back shu. </p>
<p>Qi in the chest stops at the chest and back shu; Qi in the abdomen is also stopped at the back shu.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Jade Tablet Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Coughing up blood, fullness in the chest pulling to the back, pulse thin and rapid, indicative of rebelling energy. </p>
<p><strong>Five Sounds and Five Tastes Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Chong and Ren vessels both arise from within the womb, and ascend along the back.</p>
<p><strong>Cold and Heat Diseases Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The five organs have five sections in the body: the first is the lower abdomen, the second is the calves (the calves are related to the spleen); the third is the back; the fourth corresponds to the associations of the five organs; the fifth is at the neck. If there are carbuncles or sores in these five sections, it results in death. </p>
<p>Those external conditions, such as skin being yang and bones being yin, indicate that carbuncles arise between the skin, flesh, and bones. This suggests that each of the five organs has five sections, and if the yin and yang of one section are not harmonious, it leads to stagnation and results in carbuncles. The &quot;lower abdomen&quot; relates to the kidney, the &quot;calf&quot; relates to the spleen, the &quot;back&quot; corresponds to the lung, while the associations of the five organs refer to the five vertebrae&#39;s heart associations. The &quot;neck&quot; corresponds to the liver. The classic text states: the emergence of carbuncles does not originate from external factors but from accumulated subtleties. Therefore, if there are carbuncles in these five sections, it signifies a gradual accumulation of toxic stagnation from the five organs, manifesting externally due to disharmony in blood and qi, resulting in death if present in these areas.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Jinkui Yaolue [Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji]</strong></p>

<p>For the illness of chest blockage, characterized by wheezing, coughing, spitting, pain in the chest and back, shortness of breath, a deep and slow pulse at the cun position, and a tight and rapid pulse at the guan position, use a decoction of Luo Han Qi Bai and white wine as the principal remedy. If there is chest blockage causing inability to lie down, and heart pain radiating to the back, use a decoction of Luo Han Qi Bai and Ban Xia as the principal remedy. For heart pain radiating to the back, and back pain radiating to the heart, use Wu Tou and Chi Shi Zhi pills. If there is cold in the heart, the person suffers from heart pain similar to eating garlic; if severe, heart pain radiates to the back, and back pain radiates to the heart, resembling poison. If the pulse is floating, recovery will follow self-vomiting. </p>
<p>For upper abdomen diseases, when phlegm causes fullness, wheezing, coughing, vomiting, and if accompanied by chills, fever, back pain, and lower back pain, with tears streaming from the eyes, the person may experience tremors and spasms, suggesting there may be concealed drinking.</p>
<p><strong>Zhongcangjing [Han Dynasty, Hua Tuo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain related to the organs, deficiency, excess, and cold</strong></p>
<p>When the heart pulse is slightly rapid, and heart pain radiates to the back, there is no food intake; if it is slightly stronger, it leads to back pain and excessive tearing. Overactivity of the lungs causes reversed qi with chest fullness and back pain; if deficient, it leads to shoulder and back pain. Cold in the upper jiao impedes food intake, resulting in vomiting sour fluid, radiating chest and back pain, dryness of the throat, and inability to take in fluids.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> [Tang, Sun Simiao]</p>
<p><strong>Bladder Excess Heat</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse is strong in the middle of the right wrist, it signifies excess yang, particularly affecting the foot taiyang channel. The illness manifests as difficulty urinating, dizziness and pain in the head, a feeling of fullness, and rigidity in the back, which is termed &quot;Bladder Excess Heat.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Back Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Any person who consumes metals or stones must labor their entire body and not indulge in comfort. Those who do otherwise often experience agitation. Furthermore, one must not excessively warm themselves according to their liking. It is necessary to resist desires for warmth and seek the cold; although this might cause discomfort at the time, it will ultimately be beneficial for the body and eliminate concerns of agitation.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers</strong> [Jin, Dou Hanqing]</p>
<p><strong>Back Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of sores on the back results from accumulated toxins in the organs. If the righteous qi is strong, the condition lingers; if the original qi is weak, it tends to worsen by night. The sores appear like an arrow, small outside but large within. If contained properly, they will heal; if not, they can lead to death. For treatment, ginseng and astragalus should be the primary herbs; this principle remains unchanged for centuries. If an abscess appears on the back, measuring a foot wide and an inch deep, even if it ruptures down to the bone, as long as the membrane is not pierced, it is not fatal. This condition relates to the six qi and seven emotions or may arise from diet; its toxins accumulate in the spleen and abdomen. Medications should first eliminate the toxins in the spleen and abdomen, applying internal and external treatments to ensure safety.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Fish Spine Boils</strong></p>
<p>Fish spine boils occur due to accumulation of cold in the internal organs and deficiency of kidney Yang, causing virtual heat to transmit through the meridians and spine. This can appear anywhere in the body, initially resembling sores. When they burst, yellow fluid flows out, forming white blisters that look like fish spines. If not treated promptly, the flesh may rot and pus may flow, making survival difficult. First, take the Shen Gong Huo Ming Decoction, then use Gui Qi Tiao Rong Decoction or Shen Qi Nei Tuo Powder. Externally, apply Detoxifying and Moisturizing Powder, or use Jin Si Ointment. Washing with pig trotters broth or using decocted Earth Bone Bark is particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Double-Ended Hair</strong></p>
<p>In cases of double-ended hair, which is small at both ends and scattered around the sides, this is caused by body weakness from drinking alcohol. It results from a conflict between Qi and food, leading to Yin deficiency. Due to Qi deficiency, the hair opens and widens, necessitating urgent internal medicinal treatment for resolution, and it’s advisable to also tonify Yang. The treatment method is similar to that for back and shoulder sores, with adjustments to the formula as needed. </p>
<p><strong>Kidney Shu Hair</strong></p>
<p>Kidney Shu hair is associated with Yin, often overlooked. It occurs due to summer dampness and anger, as well as drinking hot alcohol. This injures the internal kidneys, allowing toxic substances to flow into them. Quickly detoxify the internal kidney poison, attacking both internally and externally. If the physician is slow in treating the membrane, survival is unlikely. Completely avoid anger and sexual activity; even slight transgressions should not be treated. The treatment method is the same as for back boils, but supplement the kidneys with ingredients like Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, Myrrh, and Guang Jiao.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Heart Fire Disorder</strong></p>
<p>Heart fire disorder is difficult to treat. The heart is the ruler&#39;s office, from which spirit and clarity emerge. When calm and empty, how can illness arise? If the heart is upset, various illnesses will emerge. Conditions that manifest in the hands and feet all stem from heart fire. Therefore, when symptoms arise from the heart, they manifest in the back, opposing the heart; this is termed heart fire disorder. Due to the excess heart fire, heat energy accumulates in that area. As the toxicity increases, it is urgent to use medications that clear and regulate the heart fire. Careful intention must be applied, akin to military strategy, to have a chance for recovery. One must control their temperament; a single burst of anger can hinder recovery. Those symptoms arising on the side of the heart can also be treated. It is advisable to take Huang Lian Jiedu Decoction, Hu Xin San, and La Fan Wan, day and night.</p>
<p><strong>Scattered and Flowing Qi Disorder</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises between the shoulder blades, where if the qi and blood are unbalanced, the meridians obstructed, and one is affected by external elements and internal emotions, toxic qi becomes stimulated by wind and heat, causing it to disperse. This occurs due to excessive wind generating heat; when heat is extreme, qi becomes overloaded and scatters. Urgent relief is needed to disperse the wind and settle the heat to allow qi to naturally rest. If the vital energy is strong at the onset, one should promptly apply moxa on seven spots, apply medicine around the area, and take a decoction of twenty-four herbs for dispersing qi; recovery is almost certain. If the symptoms flow into the hands, feet, or legs, there is no doubt of a grim outcome.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Linked Pearls Disease</strong></p>
<p>This illness manifests with swelling of the scrotum, difficulty urinating, and abdominal distention and pain. This ulcer originates from excessive sexual desire, resulting in drunkenness and indulgence in sexual activities, which harms the kidney&#39;s water. Those afflicted with this illness will develop a series of symptoms, causing dryness of the mouth, chills and fever throughout the body, and pain in all joints. It should be treated with the Ten Marvels Powder and Liquor-Cooked Powder. If the affected area has good flesh with red and swollen edges that look like fire, use a magnetic stone to draw out the bad blood, followed by applying a mixture of chicken egg and frankincense powder. Regularly use banana root juice to moisten the area to enhance the effectiveness of the medication.</p>
<p><strong>Honeycomb Disease</strong></p>
<p>This illness presents as dark blue or blackened flesh that is significantly depressed in the center, surrounded by hard, reddish-purple tissue. It is caused by wind-venom damaging the pores. If the disease erupts, it can heal, but if it does not, it can lead to death. This toxicity arises from a rich diet, excessive warmth from heavy bedding, drunkenness, and indulgent sexual activity, causing the five organs to accumulate toxins that do not flow, eventually forming a carbuncle, resulting in mental confusion, restless nights, frequent urination, and loose stools. If this illness causes a series of symptoms on the left side, the outcome is death. The treatment should involve the internal use of the Ten Clear Powder and taking Wax Alum Pills five times daily. Once pus begins to form, take medication to expel the pus while supplementing with the Ten Clear Powder, and mix in Mu Xiang and Pangolin scales, continuing to apply Gold Silk Ointment.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p>
<h3>Jìng Tǐ Fā (Sudden Outbreak)</h3>
<p>This poison appears between the shoulder blades, arising in the hot summer when the hollow body absorbs foul qi, causing the stomach qi to deteriorate, leading to vomiting and nausea. If untreated, the poisonous qi enters within, making recovery difficult. Quickly take乳香托里散 (Mother of Pearl Base), then take五香连翘散 (Five Spice and Forsythia Powder) and蜡矾丸 (Wax and Alumen Pill), apply金丝膏 (Golden Silk Ointment) externally, and consume忍冬酒 (Honeysuckle Wine) three times a day.</p>
<h3>Lián Zǐ Fā (Lotus Seed Outbreak)</h3>
<p>This sore arises in the right shoulder region, as the poisoned qi threatens to reach the heart. It is necessary to disperse the poison with medicine, applying local treatment to prevent it from attacking the heart. If it reaches the midsection and causes swelling throughout the back, it may be irretrievable. For those with minor symptoms, treatment is possible. All sores that cause pain and itching are related to the heart, as the heart generates blood and circulates qi, which governs pain. Treat all sores with topical medicine and puncture with large needles three or four times, using前化毒消肿散 (Detoxifying and Swelling-Reducing Powder), adding extra astragalus from千金内托散 (Thousand Gold Inner Prescribing Powder), along with护心散 (Heart-protecting Powder) and蜡矾丸 (Wax and Alumen Pill). This must be done consistently.</p>
<h3>Shàng Zhōng Xià Sān Dā Shǒu (Upper, Middle, Lower Triple Hand)</h3>
<p>This poison lies in the five organs and six bowels, with toxic heat from worry and anger, harming the lung channels, accumulating into poison. This is a severe condition. Use medicines for brain abscess and back abscesses to treat it similarly, while regularly taking忍冬酒 (Honeysuckle Wine) and蜡矾丸 (Wax and Alumen Pill).<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Upper, Middle, and Lower Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>Upper back pain is related to the Taoist meridians, primarily affecting the lungs and liver. This condition can be caused by emotional distress leading to anger, which can injure the liver and result in toxins accumulating in the back. This is a serious condition. First, administer the Detoxifying Flowing Qi Decoction; next, use the Heart Protecting Dispersion; and finally, treat it with the Internal Flowing Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>Middle back pain is linked to the Spirit Hall and Spiritual Path meridians, causing heart toxicity. The heart&#39;s blood cannot return to the liver, resulting in stagnation of Qi and blood in the back, damaging the liver meridian. This is a severe condition. Herbal decoctions should be used to administer the Detoxifying Flowing Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>Lower back pain involves the Spleen and Liver meridians, causing stagnation within the internal organs and damaging three meridians. This represents the condition of the three toxins. First, use the Detoxifying Flowing Qi Decoction; then apply the Ginseng Internal Dispersion, and for external application, use surrounding medicinal herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>What is meant by phlegm accumulation? It arises from the influences of the six energies and seven emotions, leading to phlegm that cannot circulate, becoming trapped between the shoulder blades and resting within the meridians. The back is a significant area, and over time this can lead to the formation of a pouch, connecting internally to the organs and externally to the skin. It should be treated promptly. The shape may vary - it could be round, oblique, or resemble a grain bag, and feel hard like a stone. For treatment, apply surrounding herbs externally and take 40 to 50 doses of the Ginseng Internal Dispersion. Once the vital energy is sufficient, one may use purgatives, leading to the elimination of several liters of phlegm and achieving recovery.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Three String Poison</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises on the upper and lower back. Although its appearance is uniform, the skin in the center is fine, but the internal flesh is rotting. It initially presents as red and is not too painful, gradually worsening over time. The origin of this condition is attributed to influences from the six Qi and seven emotions, as well as exposure to severe cold and extreme heat, causing toxic accumulation in the organs. It may also afflict older men and women who are usually calm and silent, likely due to habitual sitting or lying in damp conditions. If there are no external symptoms, it can survive. However, if there is a decrease in appetite, diarrhea, or fever, survival becomes difficult. The treatment approach is similar to that used for back abscesses.</p>
<p><strong>Kidney-Related Anger Causing Spleen Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition occurs with dual eruptions at the lower back&#39;s kidney points due to consuming hot wine during intercourse, combined with anger that harms the liver and causes dampness. External Yang manifestations are treatable. If the phlegm causes Yin damage to the kidney membrane, and the pus is thin, it indicates weakness and is hard to treat. If older women, who are generally warm-tempered, regulate their diet and are not troubled by emotional disturbances, also suffer from this condition, it is likely due to dampness from the ground or bathing in cold water during hot months. Spleen abscess appears between the left shoulder blades; when it first manifests, it can be treated with moxibustion. Quickly taking a decoction to disperse it and sweating it out can help. The treatment method with medications is the same as before. Wax alum pills are very suitable for use.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Blood Sores and Flowing Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>This condition often occurs in people of a robust build, particularly those who enjoy consuming fried, roasted, or sugary foods. The abscess may be large, resembling a chicken egg, and it appears swollen but not red, lying between the meridians, flowing into the joints and causing widespread aches and pains. To treat this, use internal powders combined with papaya, white peony, and forsythia, and additionally take frankincense heart-protecting powder and alum pills; apply external dressings promptly. When administering medication, be mindful of the symptoms and do not strictly adhere to formulas.</p>
<p><strong>Navel-Related Poison</strong></p>
<p>Abscesses occurring in the lumbar region between the kidneys can result in swelling along the back, also referred to as &quot;navel abscess&quot; or &quot;seasonal kidney.&quot; This condition impacts the heart and can last thirty days, after which it may be punctured. If the pus is red-white, survival is likely; if it is blue-yellow or purple, and accompanied by hallucinations, it indicates internal kidney pain. Transitioning to thirst indicates dire conditions. A substantial intake of ginseng and astragalus internal formulas, along with rehmannia, coptis, and ophiopogon for nourishing kidney water, is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>From the Direct Prescription of Renjai</strong>【Song - Yang Shiying】</p>
<p><strong>Back Sores</strong><a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Whenever fever occurs, it is called a back sore; if there is no fever, it is all boils. If there are internal hidden symptoms in the five organs, they manifest as dullness without heat. </p>
<p>Abscesses on the back with hidden symptoms have a flat head directed inward, are dull and painless, the whole body and the affected area are not hot. One should take Angelica wine to expel pus, and use internal tonics like San He San and an enhanced version of Jin Zheng Qi San as supplements, along with rice flour, pig&#39;s feet, and buttock meat for nourishment. Buckwheat flour can help generate heat and can be cooked. If it does not generate heat, one can use slices of pangolin head, dip them in vinegar and fry until burnt, mixed with two and a half qian of ground human teeth.</p>
<p>This mixture can be made into two portions, using spicy cinnamon, Angelica, and Ephedra boiled in wine for oral intake; externally, ginger juice mixed with flour can be thickly applied to the affected area. </p>
<p>For back abscesses with hidden symptoms, one should internally take Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin, Mi Fang Dou Ming San, Xian Chuan Hua Du Tang, Ji Xue San, and Gou Bao Wan, as well as Sai Fei Long Duo Ming Dan. Externally, use Si Hu San for application. </p>
<p>When abscesses occur on the head, sideburns, eyebrows, and chin, and on the back, these are considered the five abscesses, which are particularly dangerous. Their symptoms often cause headache, nausea, chills and fever, breathlessness, and cramps, and require Wu Xiang San or Wu Xiang Tang. </p>
<p>To investigate the cause of the illness, there may be wind, qi, food, drug toxicity, or physical strain. Wind tends to cause itching, qi often causes pain, food leads to chills and fever, drug toxicity results in hardness, and strain leads to weakness. Wind, qi, and food accumulation are easier to treat and require Er Xiang San. Drug toxicity combined with strain is more complicated to heal.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Severe Pain with Cold Sensation</strong></p>
<p>When afflicted by wind, one may experience severe pain in the waist and spine. Wind and heat obstruct the qi, causing stagnation of the muscles and constriction of the vessels, resulting in a stiff and painful spine. In cases of cold damage, when the evil heat is on the surface, the back will certainly feel stiff and the body will be tight. In cases of Taiyang syndrome, the spine is stiff and the pulse is superficial, without sweating. With a mixed condition of yin and two yang diseases, one may experience shock, back pain, and sighing; this is termed &quot;wind seizure.&quot; It is due to the earth element of the stomach being overcome by the wood element of the liver, with wind overpowering dampness, failing to regulate kidney water, causing an upward reversal. Wind in the kidney leads to spinal pain, making it difficult to stand upright. When cold enters the meridians, it causes stagnation and tears, hindering the flow of qi, resulting in pain pulling between the heart and back. If qi travels up to the wind palace, it results in &quot;wind in the brain,&quot; causing cold sensations in the back.</p>
<p><strong>Back Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of a back ulcer, one can use the Zangyong Pill and Yuzhu Powder as a powerful remedy, administering it to the internal organs a dozen or more times. With a needle, prick the swollen area to draw out blood, doing this three times. In severe cases, blood may also be drawn from the Baihui and Weizhong regions, followed by applying Yangqishi Powder. It is not advisable to casually take internal tonics with Guigui, especially when cooked with alcohol. The back is considered yang in men, and applying heat to heat could be excessive. If the ulcer shows little improvement, or if the ulcer’s edges have not closed, or if the scab has not formed, but there is wind itch, one may use internal tonics to dispel wind evils. </p>
<p><strong>Stagnant Qi Causes Pain</strong><a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: Wind-cold leads to sweating, shoulder and back pain, and incomplete urination. When wind-heat invades the lungs, it severely obstructs lung qi. One should expel the wind-heat and promote qi; Fangfeng Decoction is the main remedy. For shoulder and back pain, do not look back; this is due to qi stagnation in the Taiyang channel, and one should disperse it with wind herbs.</p>
<p>As for the back abscess, it first appears the size of a millet grain, itchy and painful with a distinct feeling. If touched and ruptured, it will expand and exhibit a red, swollen, and heavy sensation, pulling and causing pain in the ribs. After several days, the skin increasingly feels hot, with chills and thirst. The swelling spreads, with pus oozing, and if it does not rupture for days, and suppression leads to bleeding, it is called a back abscess. </p>
<p>There can also be an initial stage with no head, swelling three to four inches wide, first felt as dull pain; after several days, if the skin appears smooth and soft, it can lead to fever, chills, headache, and thirst; this is called a back boil. This condition is particularly severe. The initial formation of these abscesses is mostly due to rich foods and thick clothing. Thick warm clothing invites cold easily, while excessive rich foods create heat within the five organs. When the organs accumulate heat, blood flow is obstructed and toxic qi stagnates. The pathogenic qi is trapped, heat attacks the blood, and when the blood stagnates, it leads to meat rotting into sores. A mild case is a furuncle, a severe one is a boil, and a deep case is an abscess. There are also instances where the condition arises from the use of metals or stones, as well as cases where individuals who have never taken such substances still develop this illness. This is attributed to ancestral toxic influences being passed down. Once this disease first emerges and is recognized as an abscess, prompt treatment is advisable.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If one has strong passion, they should take Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction and Loushu Decoction. For those under fifty, robust and young, they may take Wuli Dahuang Decoction or Huadu Wan, to promote the flow and support organ function. For lesions, use a remedy like Zhui Du San and apply warm poultices, along with Tanshong Decoction and Huidu Decoction for cleansing. Such treatments are to be administered while awaiting the formation of pus. Prior to this, do not use various medicines for healing, to settle the patient&#39;s mind; be careful not to provoke anger. Once the pus has formed and ruptured, it is advisable to take Five-Spice Decoction, along with Neituoli San, Fuling Decoction, and Danggui Neituoli San. If there is unquenchable thirst, take Zhuye Huangqi Decoction or Ruxiang San. Do not induce great heat; avoid bitter cold drugs such as Dahuang and (Shibu) Nitre. If taking purgative medicines results in persistent diarrhea, it can be fatal. If there is still necrotic tissue in the wound and the pus is not flowing well, use destructive medicines, or apply a binding agent, topped with powdered deer antler mixed with vinegar to create a paste for application. As necrotic tissue recedes and healthy tissue gradually forms, use Shou Pus San and Cuixia San for binding. If the toxicity of the sore has not fully dissipated, be cautious not to use muscle-generating medicines too early; even if recovery seems possible, the problem is likely to recur. During this process, careful adjustment and timely considerations are crucial, taking care to safeguard and avoid potential mistakes.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><em>Zhu Zhenheng</em></p>
<p><strong>Cold Pain</strong></p>
<p>The area between the shoulder blades is often cold, caused by phlegm. Those who are good at treating phlegm do not treat the phlegm directly but instead address the qi; when the qi flows smoothly, the body’s fluids will also flow in accordance with it. Generally, individuals experience a cold sensation in the back as if a line has been drawn, which is also caused by phlegm, and it is advisable to expel it. For pain in the spine and shoulder blades, it is recommended to use a decoction of Atractylodes.</p>
<p><strong>Back Boils</strong></p>
<p>Boils on the back initially present as swelling due to the accumulation of qi and blood, which then transforms the flesh into pus, causing pain mostly at the onset of the boil. Once the pus is discharged and the swelling subsides, the pain will gradually lessen; however, if pain reoccurs, this indicates deficiency, and nourishment is needed. If there is contact with foul qi, harmonization is advisable. For wind-cold invasion, warmth and dispersion are recommended. In cases of deficiency and weakness, where the protective and nutritive qi are blocked, with a sensation of heaviness as if bearing a stone, do not use aromatic and drying herbs; instead, use Kidney Qi Pills or Tuo Li San.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>There are those who consume gold and stone to enhance desire, which leads to the depletion of vital energy and an excess of toxic substances. Gold and stone are similar to the lungs, and since the lungs are connected to the kidneys, this often results in back pain. There are also treatments using soft-shelled turtles; they can be used for back pain because the yang energy of the turtle gathers in the upper back, making it suitable for medicinal use. If toxins arise in the lower regions, and one cannot use warming herbs such as Aconite or Cinnamon, with exterior pain and internal cold, one should use Five-Spice Decoction. For individuals with back sores or those suffering from excessive bleeding after sores have erupted, and where bodily fluids are scant, Muscle Change Powder is recommended. If toxins first manifest with headaches and body aches, alternating between chills and fever, it is likely that external pathogens are present, and one should administer Xiang Su Decoction with additions of Chuanxiong, Bai Zhi, Fang Feng, Dang Gui, and Chen Pi.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aversion to Cold Associated with Fluid Disorder</strong></p>
<p>Aversion to cold in the back indicates phlegm and fluid. Zhang Zhongjing states: if there is retained fluid under the heart, the person experiences aversion to cold in the back, feeling like ice; thus, Poria Pill is the remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with the Lungs</strong></p>
<p>Shoulder and back pain relates to the lung territory. The classic text states: &quot;Western winds arise in autumn, and diseases are in the lungs, manifesting in the shoulders and back.&quot; Therefore, autumn conditions can lead to illnesses affecting the shoulders and back. Additionally, it is stated: &quot;Excessive lung condition in autumn leads to illnesses that result in reversed qi, causing back pain and irritability.”<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Conditions Related to Heat</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: When the year is excessively hot, the people suffer from shoulder and back heat. It also states: In the presence of lesser yin affecting Heaven, where heat overwhelms, there are pains in the shoulder and back, especially in the area of the shoulder blade. Additionally, it mentions: When the year&#39;s metal is insufficient, diseases manifest internally in the chest and sides, externally on the skin. Treating these with cold remedies is the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Loss in the Back</strong></p>
<p>To treat hair loss in the back, Sea藏 (a herbal remedy) uses the Deadly Dan and Cang Er formula. One utilizes rhubarb and oyster shell, while the other uses Cang Er, indicating a distinction between internal and external. Previously, using the Deadly Dan with two medicines shows their different effects; this is due to the changes in diet. The pulse can be deep and slippery, indicating that dampness from the ground affects the flesh and tendons; if the pulse is floating and slippery, there will be differences in discharge and hair loss.</p>
<p>Among humanity&#39;s greatest concerns, hair loss in the back is one of the five types: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Yang toxin. This arises from wind and heat, either causing heat toxin to lead to excessive thirst or manifesting after suffering from cold damage, with residual yang toxin accumulating at the back. It does not matter how many vertebrae are involved; it simply arises from between the two sides of the spine and extends up to the waist, often presenting as heat throughout the back, red, purple, or flame-like, with pus that is hard to generate. Once formed, pain persists; when it seems to subside in a few days, it is merely a deceptive appearance. This is an internal attack causing flesh to sink, which cannot be treated.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The second type is a toxic boil appearing on the back. This condition arises from cold energy and starts as small as millet grains. If emotions are unhappy, it causes dull pain directly in the chest, leading to heart disquiet and a heavy head, with chills and fever resembling malaria. After five to seven days, it will begin to swell and spread, making it difficult to contain. There is pus accumulating inside, deep and slow. If it hasn&#39;t broken out yet, it&#39;s best to urgently use tonic herbal medicine to nourish the qi and externally apply poultices to draw out the pus. If pus is observed, it is advisable to act quickly; if there is no pus, healing may occur on its own, but not until later.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third type occurs in individuals who frequently consume medicines made from metals or stones, resulting in toxicity and stagnation that causes boils. Initially, it manifests like a red rash, gradually opening up like a burn; the face turns crimson, and there is anxiety and restlessness within the chest, accompanied by extreme thirst and a preference for cold. These sores are difficult to form and, when they do, startle others more than those from either yin or yang toxins. Therefore, there is a prescription for antidotal medicine to treat the internal toxicity of metal and stone. A clear foundation needs to be established, and urgent treatment is necessary for safety.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Fourth, there are those who suffer from toxic reactions in the back due to food and alcohol. This ailment is not acquired recently; rather, it results from long-term accumulation in the organs. When one is hungry and fatigued, they eat and then sleep; or they consume excessive amounts of rich, greasy, and cold food and drink, causing obstruction in the chest. With unchecked indulgence in the wind, the spleen&#39;s energy becomes deficient, unable to resist the accumulation, resulting in toxicity attacking the back. The pain does not discriminate by the number of vertebrae but begins as small lumps like marbles, later growing to the size of fists, hard as stone, causing widespread pain, stiff limbs, bitter mouth, dry tongue, abdominal distress, and difficulty with urination and defecation. After ten days, there may be swelling in the head, face, hands, and feet, alongside gastrointestinal leakage. The urgent pain signifies this condition. If there is a tendency to swell, immediate use of swelling-relief remedies is essential, and the issue must be treated without delay; pus and fluid should not be allowed to accumulate. Otherwise, neglect can lead to skin necrosis, bone injury, and muscle decay, resulting in increased pus production, internal disintegration from external pathogens, leading to death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fifth, there are those who suffer from toxic reactions in the back due to exposure to mountain miasmas and pestilential air.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Initially in the organs, as time passes, the Qi and blood become deficient and weaken. It begins with a swelling that is dark blue or black like a boot, accompanied by a hard pain, deeply affecting the muscles and bones, reaching the marrow. Pressing it feels like touching wood or stone; only by pressing harder can one feel a painful spot. After five to seven days, the toxic Qi rises, causing a shallow, swollen area that turns pale blue, resembling the effect of a punch. There may be chills akin to malaria, and symptoms of wind exposure, with the head shifting and the mouth skewed, hands and feet feeling cold and in reversal, the eyes appearing dark with excessive whites, sluggish. This indicates an internal struggle with evil Qi. It is urgent to expel three to five liters of clear blood to allow the yellow pus and white fluid to flow out. The skin remains neither relaxed nor slow but urgent; the swelling and pain do not cease until the color fades and the heat and pain finally subside. It’s advisable to urgently expel the pus and toxic Qi outwards, as it does no harm. </p>
<p>There may be abscesses or sores on the back, like the toxic Qi is fierce, and the onset resembles flames burning brush, making it prone to decay. It begins as small as a millet grain; in three to four days, it becomes red and swollen, as large as the palm of a hand, and within five to seven days, it can be as large as a bowl, making it easy to attack.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>When the heat is intense and resembles a fire burning, the surface gradually breaks down and broadens, with internal swelling like the cooking of food. The external skin and flesh rot away, as if purple bruises are removed. There is a large amount of pus, and the swelling does not subside, with persistent pain. The patient experiences difficulty with eating and drinking, with symptoms of vomiting and shortness of breath. In cases where the condition is superficial and broad, it is especially advisable to use pus-generating medicinals to detoxify; usage will surely result in healing, as this represents a real yang syndrome.</p>
<p>In some cases, there may be one that is only the size of a teacup; this does not indicate a lack of size but rather that the toxic qi is deeply rooted, and there is internal deficiency close to the membranes. This must internally attack the viscera and then externally afflict the limbs, first targeting the head and face with superficial swelling, then affecting the hands and subsequently the two feet. If the face is swollen and the toxic qi disseminates into the limbs, the person may have a hoarse voice and gasp for breath, with darkened small eyes and swollen black fingers, dry and scorched without treatment, indicating a true yin syndrome of deficiency.</p>
<p>Whenever boils or abscesses first arise, with firm and swollen elevations, yet the toxic qi is shallower, this indicates disharmony in the six bowels leading to the boil, which is a yang symptom. Although the situation appears urgent, it is easier to treat.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>If it first appears like a grain of millet, sometimes as large as a bean, and is level with the flesh, it may be red, occasionally causing itching and pain. During the itching, be careful not to scratch it open; this indicates a disorder in the five organs leading to a boil. Its symptoms are of yin nature, reflecting that toxic gas has accumulated deeply within. Though it progresses slowly, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>If it first appears as large as a broad bean, the body heats up; the area of the boil swells and is hot and painful. This is an external outbreak; even if it is as large as a basin, treating it properly will certainly lead to recovery—this is a manifestation of yang.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the body does not feel hot and there is a sense of fatigue, the boil is also not warm. After several days, it gradually enlarges, without swelling or pain, sinking down and rotting. This indicates an internal outbreak; even immortals cannot remedy this—this is a manifestation of yin deficiency.</p>
<p>At first, when swelling occurs, treating it with moxibustion within three days will yield results. If pus forms within eight days and proper guiding techniques are applied, it will also lead to healing. If one engages in labor before it has healed, it will worsen. Care in diet will help in recovery. Managing emotions will also assist. Aggressive treatment of the swelling will lead to complications, as will rushed treatments. Disregarding the risk of it spreading will lead to improvement.</p>
<p>If one waits for the pus to come out on its own without any guiding treatment, it may lead to death. If there is no internal attack and guiding treatment is applied with the use of needles and moxibustion, recovery is possible; however, if internal issues have arisen and treatments are applied afterward, it may result in death.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>When pus and heat pain are severe, those previously treated may survive; however, if the condition has progressed and becomes internal, death is certain. If pus forms but does not drain and only topical medicine is applied, death will occur. In cases of red or white dysentery with severe Qi stagnation, it indicates internal attack; treatment will be ineffective, and death is inevitable. Infected boils, if not treated, will have a survival rate of only five out of ten, while untreated carbuncles will have a mortality rate of ten out of ten. Those with mild swelling and pain sensitivity will surely die. Without encountering effective methods, one will die. If treatment does not adhere to the proper timing, death is assured. Those foolishly adhering to their own desires and indulging in their emotions will die.</p>
<p>In general, for boils and carbuncles on the back, regardless of size, whether painful or not, hot or cold, as long as the swelling increases to over one foot, if it is red and swollen with heat, immediate use of urgent remedies to reduce the red swelling should be applied without allowing drainage. Center treatment involves using remedies to draw out pus and disperse toxins, urgently expelling toxins while internally administering remedies to drain pus and consolidate toxins. Wait for the pus to form, then successively drain the abscess, observing the state of the sore&#39;s size and depth to allow the pus to release. If the pus flows abundantly, urgent internal nourishment is required; even if the abscess is opened with little pus, further draining and toxin expulsion is necessary.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Be cautious not to allow a swelling to recur; it is essential to alleviate pain and reduce swelling. If the patient feels light and comfortable, it indicates a favorable response to the illness. It is crucial to regulate diet carefully. When heat and toxins are prevalent, one may experience intense thirst and should avoid excessive consumption of cold water and cold drinks. This is due to toxic energies attacking the heart, leading to dry mouth and discomfort. Instead, one should use heart-nourishing medications to support the internal organs. Nourishing refers to ingredients like ginseng and astragalus, while expelling pus includes substances like soapberry thorns.</p>
<p>For furuncles, if they arise on the hip and back, particularly at the heart and pericardium points, if not needled within twenty days, it can be fatal. They can be needled after ten days. If the color is reddish-black with clear pus, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>For special furuncles, if they occur at the lung and liver points, if not needled, they lead to death within twenty days. They can be needled after eight days. If the color is deep red with hidden, pepper-like elevations, it is fatal.</p>
<p>For the dual-qi furuncle, which can be broad or small on the back, exhibiting swelling and heat, they can be needled after ten days. Expelling pus, regardless of how deep or shallow, is necessary. If the patient experiences thirst and fatigue, and no pus is observed within ten days, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>For tendon furuncles, if they occur on both sides of the spine along the large tendons, with a bluish color, they can be needled after eight days. If there is a boil in the large intestine, it can lead to death within ninety days.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Individuals with a consistently cold back often suffer from phlegm and dampness; they should take a decoction for phlegm combined with Suzi Decoction to relieve qi. If the back feels cold, it can have both yin and yang manifestations: in the case of a lesser yin pattern of cold damage, the back will feel unbearably cold while the mouth is warm; in the yangming pattern, the back feels cold and the mouth is dry. This helps distinguish between cold and heat. Heat in the back is attributed to the lungs, as the lungs are situated in the upper jiao, hence the heat manifests there. </p>
<p>For dampness, if the back is stooped and the feet have contracted rendering them almost useless, one can take a small amount of sweet hemp to be stewed with pig kidneys; if there’s vomiting and diarrhea, this will cure it.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Back Bumps and Swelling:</strong></p>
<p>If a back bump causes heat and pain, is red in color with thirst, and has a rapid, strong pulse, one should first take the Life-Saving Drink, followed by the Decoction to Clear the Heat and Remove Toxins. If the swelling is not hot, has slight pain, is dark in color, causes thirst, and has a weak rapid pulse, it is due to kidney deficiency; one should use the Decoction to Clear the Heat. If there is reduced appetite, take Six Gentlemen Decoction with ginger. If there’s evening heat and yin deficiency, use the Four Substances Decoction with ginseng and atractylodes, or Kidney Qi Pill. If cold feels increasingly bad around the body, this indicates yang deficiency; use only ginseng soup or the Ten Complete Tonics Decoction. Frequent urination suggests taking the Eight Flavor Pill. If appetite is diminished at the onset, it indicates an overwhelming pathogen and spleen deficiency, requiring urgent use of the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Boost Qi for rescue. Nowadays, people solely rely on the Sai Ming Dan or Yao Jin for cases due to anger or food poisoning and in obese individuals, which might suffice; yet in thin individuals or cases driven by sexual desire, it can inversely cause depletion of yin leading to thirst and diarrhea, or obstructing blood and toxic qi which can be fatal within ten days if not properly treated. Generally, humid bumps with robust qi and blood are easier to treat. If the swelling does not respond to detoxifying medication, it indicates that toxicity exceeds qi and blood, which can be fatal in a few days.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If it has already emitted but is not festering, one must urgently use the Tuli medication and also replenish the spleen and stomach; otherwise, death will occur within twenty days. If it has festered but the color is not red or active, use Tuli powder with ginseng, astragalus, cinnamon, and spleen-replenishing medicine, but it cannot regenerate muscle. If the wound edges are dark and large without closing, it indicates spleen collapse, leading to death within a month. For exterior symptoms combined with interior sweating, and interior conditions needing to regulate the meridians and resolve internal issues. For those with a weak constitution, if not festering, use Tuli for disinfection; if festering, use Tuli for warming and tonifying. </p>
<p>Although back carbuncles are governed by the bladder and governor vessels, all five organs are connected to the back. They may arise from overeating rich foods, emotional distress, or physical exertion, leading to depletion of water and inflammation of fire, excessive phlegm, and heat in the blood. They can also be triggered by external evils and toxins, appearing anywhere, commonly under the shoulder or along the spine, due to dietary intake of toxins, extending one foot wide and one inch deep. Even if festering internally, if the membrane is not pierced, it will not be fatal; immediate treatment for the toxins in the spleen and abdomen is required, taking heart-protecting powder internally and applying topical medicine externally to prevent distress in the heart. The primary course of action is to take medicine to cut it off. If there is swelling along the spine, it is hopeless.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Lotus Seed Eruption</strong></p>
<p>The lotus seed erupts in the right shoulder; it appears like a lotus pod, with a central opening. There is a fear that its poison may rush into the heart. Generally, one should use the Tuo Li San, combined with Huang Qin, Lian, Huang Bo, and He Gai San, to avoid attacking the heart, allowing it to gradually dissipate and become treatable. If there is swelling in the back, it is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Spleen Eruption</strong></p>
<p>The spleen eruption occurs between the left arms. At the onset, it can be broken with a flame; internally, use Chui Ding Decoction. Sweating will disperse it.</p>
<p><strong>Honeycomb Eruption</strong></p>
<p>The honeycomb eruption typically occurs along the spine; it resembles a honeycomb. Those with openings at the top are particularly unfavorable and serve as counter-indications. Tuo Li San with chrysanthemum should be used to promote flesh regeneration and alleviate pain, preventing the poison from attacking the heart. It is difficult to treat because the heart fire has yet to arise.</p>
<p><strong>Heart-facing Eruption</strong><a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Severe heart disturbances arise from an excess of heart fire, leading to concentrated heat in this area. The toxicity becomes intense and aggressive, necessitating the urgent use of remedies to clear the heart fire.</p>
<p><strong>Flowing Disturbance</strong><br>Flowing disturbances disperse and escape; poisonous vapors ride the wind and heat, so it is crucial to disperse the wind and calm the heat for treatment, allowing the energy to stabilize. If this disturbance occurs in the hands, feet, or legs, death is inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Shape Disturbance</strong><br>This disturbance has both ends pointed, with the sides spreading out widely, resembling the shape of a turtle. It arises from dietary issues, linked to the energy and food intake, coupled with yin deficiency. The energy disperses due to weakness, leading to an open and wide mouth; urgent use of remedies to support energy is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case</strong><br>The moxibustion method and medications:<br>The &quot;Essentials&quot; states: The classics say all pain, itching, sores, and lesions belong to heart fire. Previous practitioners noted that carbuncles and abscesses often occur in those who labor heavily in the stone industry. For anyone over the age of forty who develops sores on their back or elsewhere, it is advisable to calm the heart and seek early treatment. These symptoms are like a tiger entering a home; if handled poorly, they will harm the person. First, use internal remedies to disperse toxicity, followed by Lianqiao Wuxiang Decoction, and additionally use the method of moxibustion on the foot Sanli point, or moxibustion with garlic to expel the toxins. The presence of evil causes energy deficiency; if left unattended, the illness becomes severe. Therefore, if carbuncles or abscesses have not burst, internal organs are still harboring toxins, and not even a bit of heat-inducing medicine should be used. If the carbuncles or abscesses have burst, and the internal organs are already depleted, not even a bit of cold medicine should be used. It is also important to avoid plasters that may close up the pores.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>If there is heat, thirst, and constipation, with a pulse that is deep, forceful, and rapid, it is advisable to use herbs like Da Huang to purge the toxins. Afterwards, use remedies such as Guo Lao Gao, Wan Jin San, Huang Fan Wan, or Yuan Zhi Jiu, choosing as appropriate.</p>
<p>Note: If the symptoms indicate heat toxins accumulated internally, with constipation but no deficiency of vital energy, it is best to use Da Huang and similar medicines to expel the heat and toxins. If there is deficiency in yin with an excess of yang, leading to insufficient essence and depleted qi, and weak spleen and stomach, warming tonics should be used to replenish the source. </p>
<p>If sores are not ulcerated or swollen but not festering, they still require warming and tonifying. If sores have already ulcerated, with swelling that persists and pain that does not stop, cooling remedies should still be applied. </p>
<p>In cases of acute illness with sufficient vital energy, treat the symptoms first; in cases of chronic illness with deficient vital energy, treat the root cause first. If the illness is acute and vital energy is even more deficient, it is essential to treat the root cause first while also managing the symptoms.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Generally, if there is swelling, pain, and thick, sticky pus, the vital energy is not damaged, and treatment is easy; if there is diffuse swelling, slight pain, and clear, thin pus, the vital energy is weak, and treatment is difficult; if there is no swelling or pain, or if there is diffuse swelling that is dark in color and unrelieved, it arises from Yin, and the vital energy is severely deficient, thus it should not be treated. </p>
<p>If there is swelling, pain, and high elevation, first use the Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction, then use the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder. For diffuse swelling and slight pain, it is advisable to use the Tuo Li Powder; if there is no response, add ginger and cinnamon. If pus is discharged but there is pain, it indicates deficiency of Qi and blood, use the Ba Zhen Powder. If there is no pus, no necrosis, it indicates deficient Yang Qi, use Si Jun Powder plus Gui, Qi, and cinnamon. If there is no generation of flesh, no retraction, it indicates deficient spleen Qi, use the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction plus ginger and cinnamon. If there is fever in the afternoon and internal heat, it indicates deficiency of Yin blood, use Si Wu Decoction plus ginseng and Atractylodes. If there is a desire to vomit or actual vomiting, it indicates deficient stomach Qi, use the Liu Jun Decoction plus roasted ginger. If there is spontaneous sweating or night sweats, it indicates deficiency of the five organs, use the Liu Wei Wan plus Schisandra.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>When there is little food intake and physical weakness, it indicates a deficiency of the spleen and qi. One should use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; and add Poria and Pinellia. If there are symptoms of wheezing and coughing, it indicates deficiency of the spleen and lungs. In this case, one adds wheat and five-flavor fruit to the previous decoction. For nausea and reduced appetite, it indicates deficiency of the spleen and stomach, thus &quot;Ren Shen Li Zhong Decoction&quot; should be used. For abdominal pain and diarrhea, indicating cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach, use &quot;Fu Zi Li Zhong Decoction.&quot; For distension in the lower abdomen and swelling in the lower legs, indicating weakness of the spleen and kidneys, use &quot;Shiquan Dabu Decoction&quot; with additions of spiny date, yam, and cinnamon. For diarrhea with cold feet, also indicating weakness of the spleen and kidneys, add cinnamon and aconite to the previous medicine. For thirst accompanied by heat and urinary difficulty, it indicates kidney yin deficiency fire; one should use the modified &quot;Eight Flavors Pill.&quot; For wheezing and urinary difficulty, indicating deficiency fire of the lungs and kidneys, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; combined with the modified &quot;Eight Flavors Pill.&quot; All these variations are caused by depletion of the vital energy, a result of inadequate preemptive supplementation. Therefore, Master Danxi stated: &quot;Whenever one sees swelling and pain, and the pulse indicates weakness, one should supplement; if there is no deficiency of qi and blood, one can ensure a good outcome.&quot; This statement is profound! It is essential to adapt treatments to the differing conditions of deficiency and excess throughout history and apply treatments according to the times, which can lead to slight differences.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Protecting and Treating Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>Li states: Although there are many prescriptions for treating boils, few are truly effective. Now, I will select and record those that have been proven to work, hoping to avoid misleading people. For example, the Heart Protecting Powder—whenever there is a boil or sore, it should be taken several times early on to help expel the toxins without causing nausea; otherwise, sores may appear on the throat, mouth, and tongue, or they may become black and rotten like fungus. If the sore develops after four or five days, it is advisable to use a different medicine for treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Heart Protecting Powder is a remedy for boils caused by stones and metals. If there is fever with swollen painful areas, accompanied by thirst and vomiting from drinking cold water, it should be used. Conversely, if there is fever, swelling, thirst, and vomiting from drinking broth, it should not be used. If there is spleen deficiency with phlegm stagnation or cold invasion, or if there is pain affecting the spleen and stomach, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used. If sores appear on the throat and tongue, with dryness of the mouth and frequent urination, the Six Flavor Pill should be prescribed.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>In general, if one has sores and feels nauseous, or if drinking cold leads to constipation, it is due to heat poison, which can be resolved with Huanglian Xiaodu San. If drinking cold results in a balanced condition, it indicates stomach fire, treatable with Zhuye Shigao Tang to clear it. If one is disinterested in food and drinks soup, it signifies stomach deficiency, to be addressed with Buzhong Yiqi Tang for nourishment. If the stool is loose and there is a preference for hot soup, it points to cold deficiency in the spleen and stomach, to be warmed with Liu Jun Jia Pao Jiang. Those with weak spleen and stomach conditions may find that using the previous remedies causes internal coldness, leading to nausea. For sores on the throat and tongue, this indicates depletion of kidney water and rising false heat; if the symptoms are severe, urgently use the modified Bamei Wan, which has been known to restore life. </p>
<p>For back sores (abscesses), thirst often appears before and sometimes after the sores, and neglecting it is perilous. Taking the modified Bamei Wan not only alleviates thirst but also greatly nourishes qi and blood, promoting muscle growth.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Sources of Boils</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>External factors; </li>
<li>Weakness and stagnation of energy; </li>
<li>Anger; </li>
<li>Kidney energy deficiency; </li>
<li>Consumption of cold drinks, hot foods, and pills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the causes of the aforementioned conditions vary, the treatment methods should also carefully distinguish between the meridians, the deficiencies and excesses of yin and yang, as well as external and internal swelling and ulceration. The primary goal is to support the stomach and strengthen energy to ensure a solid foundation, thereby safeguarding against potential risks.</p>
<p><strong>Life and Death Signs</strong></p>
<p>Question: Some illnesses are severe and lead to death, while others are mild yet still result in death. How can one differentiate between conditions that indicate life or death? </p>
<p>Answer: If there is an abscess on the back that penetrates the internal membrane, it is a sign of death; this refers to the area above the liver. If there is yet no penetration but the face turns blue and the lips black, with dark stool, it indicates death; this refers to organ deterioration with stagnant blood. </p>
<p>There are various causes for the conditions mentioned, including weakness of the original qi leading to internal toxicity, initial manifestations that fail to promote internal harmony, excessive toxicity that fails to dissipate, weakness that fails to be replenished, formation of pus that fails to be drained, and corruption leading to failure in nourishment. If the abscesses are due to damp-heat obstruction, the use of Huanglian Jiedu San and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang is advised to eliminate dampness and toxins, bolster the spleen and lungs, and nourish the water of the kidneys.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>Effect of Wheat Meal Stone Plaster</p>
<p>Li said: Wheat meal stone plaster treats carbuncles and abscesses with remarkable efficacy, though sadly few in the world know of its virtues. There was a patient whose pus did not rupture; after applying a toxic medicine, the condition worsened, and the poison spread to the throat and knees, resulting in an untreatable state. I used this plaster, and in one night it ruptured. Whenever there is pus in an abscess, the poison begins to resolve. If there is no rupture, this plaster must be applied. Thus, I record it to allow for careful selection and adjustment, aiming for complete success.</p>
<p>Moreover, in cases where the symptoms belong to the yang and the qi and blood are not harmed, applying this plaster will surely lead to healing. However, for cases that belong to the yin and show deficiency in qi and blood, one must carefully assess the cause and adjust the internal condition accordingly. Generally, the formation of sores and ulcers arises from improper gastric qi; the rupture of sores and ulcers stems from the corruption of gastric qi; the healing of sores and ulcers depends on the nourishment of gastric qi. I have treated initial swellings by dispersing them; those on the verge of producing pus by facilitating their decay; pus that has formed but not ruptured by encouraging its opening; and once pus has ruptured by promoting its healing. Mr. Dongyuan stated that gastric qi is the source of vitality and the foundation of the human body. Mr. Danxi also remarked that treating sores should involve strengthening the stomach to bolster qi, ensuring the foundation is solid. His words are profound!<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Cold, Heat, and Excessive Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Li stated: Recently, there have been several cases of back abscess, either starting with cold followed by heat, or the other way around, or occurring on consecutive days or intermittently. These patients must experience vomiting, phlegm, and profuse sweating before their condition improves, and both Chai Hu and Heng Shan were ineffective. I believe this is due to an imbalance in the spleen&#39;s energy, compounded by the invasion of cold and excessive phlegm. Therefore, I first used Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San, followed by Pái Nóng Nèi Tuō San and Mu Xiang Tang, and within three days, they recovered. </p>
<p>If, after the external evil has been expelled, symptoms persist, one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang to nourish the spleen and stomach. Generally, if vomiting occurs due to weakened stomach energy, warmth is preferred; if caused by internal heat and toxins, cold is favored. Treatment should be differentiated accordingly.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Fever Associated with Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Li said: When there is a fever affecting the back, it invariably arises from kidney deficiency. It is essential to take the modified Eight Flavor Pill at the early hours of the morning. The previous discussion is indeed a guide for future generations and a lasting benefit. Fever along the back results from damp-heat in the kidney meridian, with deficient fire rising, leading to adverse symptoms. Unless one takes the modified Eight Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water and restrain heart fire, supplement the center and benefit Qi to generate transformation, it would be difficult to seek recovery. Qi Yuanzi stated: If there is extreme cold yet no heat, it signifies a lack of fire, and thus one should support the heart. If there is extreme heat yet no cold, it signifies a lack of water, and thus one should nourish the kidneys. Cold without cold means there is insufficient water; heat without heat means there is insufficient fire. Prolonged heat indicates a deficiency of the heart; prolonged cold indicates a lack of water. I suggest that for lack of fire, one should use the Eight Flavor Pill to nourish the heart; for lack of water, one should use the Six Flavor Pill to nourish the kidneys. Furthermore, according to &quot;Zhouhou,&quot; if you cut off one end of a winter melon and place it over a sore, when it rots, cut it again and apply it. If there is severe swelling and pain with the pathogen on the surface, this method is most suitable to disperse heat and draw out toxins to resolve stagnation. If swelling and pain are accompanied by thirst and constipation, indicating that the pathogen is internal, one must assist with Huang Lian Decoction, to open and benefit the organs for detoxification; if located in the meridians, it is advisable to use Tuo Li Rong Wei Decoction to regulate Qi and blood, which is excellent.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Three Causes of Separation</p>
<p>Chen Wuze states: Those who develop back pain are influenced by three causes. The discussion states: boils, sores, and tuberculosis, regardless of whether they are due to deficiency or excess, cold or heat, all arise from stagnant qi. The classic text also states: qi accumulates in the meridians, thickening with blood, causing blockage that leads to boils and sores. It does not mention that heat must be present later for boils to form; rather, this is a result of internal causes such as pent-up emotions—joy, anger, worry, or thought.</p>
<p>When the body has heat and is struck by wind and cold, the blood vessels become congested and fail to flow, resulting in heat accumulation and blockage. There are also cases where yin deficiency and yang qi converge, causing cold to transform into heat, leading to decay of flesh into pus; this, too, arises from external causes of cold, heat, wind, or dampness.</p>
<p>Moreover, ingesting certain elixirs or consuming overly heated wine, using thick bedding, or exhausting oneself sexually—all of these lead to empty yang and disrupted qi’s adjustment. Hence, it is understood that the three causes are comprehensive. However, while the three causes are classified, the variations in the pathogens that affect skin, surface, or internal conditions are not distinctly outlined, therefore the treatment methods cannot be thoroughly detailed.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p>
<h3>Overview of Back Sores</h3>
<p>Back sores are associated with the Governing Meridian and the Bladder Channel. They can arise from various causes: excess heat due to Yin deficiency, consumption of rich foods and alcohol, emotional distress, or heat toxins from minerals. </p>
<p>If there is significant swelling, redness, and pain, with a strong and rapid pulse, this indicates heat toxin, which is easier to treat. If there is diffuse swelling with slight pain, a dark color, and despite a rapid pulse it feels weak, this indicates Yin deficiency, which is more difficult to treat. If there is no swelling or pain, or diffuse swelling with a dark color and a weak, thin pulse, this indicates severe Yang deficiency and is particularly hard to treat.</p>
<p>For individuals with back sores, it is difficult to conceal the symptoms. Use about ten douts of mung bean and make a large bag to hide it, which will naturally cool the heart and calm the body. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain, accompanied by chills and fever, while appetite remains unchanged, this indicates excess of both form and spirit. Start with the Immortal Vitality Decoction, followed by the Elimination of Toxins Powder for resolution.</p>
<p>For headache and stiffness as a surface condition, take one or two doses of Ginseng Poison-Dispelling Powder first. For cramping pain, use Honeysuckle Powder or Sophora Flower Wine, or the effective Elimination of Toxins Powder.</p>
<p>For pain and hard swelling with a solid pulse, employ cooling drinks, Immortal Vitality Decoction, or Bitter Root Pills. If there is hard swelling with a wooden feeling, pain, heat, restlessness, cold drinks causing constipation, and a deep solid pulse, then use the Internal Clearing Huanglian Decoction or a cooling drink.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The stool has been released, and if pus is desired, use the Immortal Formulation for Vitality Drink, Toli Powder, and Lapis Aluminis Pill, and externally apply the Divine Efficacy Ointment. If there is mild swelling and slight pain or the color is not red, accompanied by little appetite and thoughts, this indicates deficiency in both form and qi, and Toli Powder should be used to replenish. If there is no pus or if pus forms but does not rupture, it indicates yang qi deficiency; therefore, Toli Powder should be increased with cinnamon, ginseng, and astragalus. If pus emerges but causes pain again or if the pus is clear and thin, it indicates deficiency in both qi and blood, and Ba Zhen Decoction should be used. If there is aversion to cold and a cold body, or if it does not contract, it signifies yang qi deficiency; thus, Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction is recommended. If there is heat in the afternoon or heat inside, or if it does not contract, it signifies yin qi deficiency; therefore, Si Wu Decoction plus ginseng and atractylodes should be used. If there is nausea and a desire to vomit or if it does not contract, it indicates stomach qi deficiency; in this case, Liu Jun Zi Decoction plus roasted ginger should be taken. If there is little appetite and fatigue, or if it does not contract, it indicates spleen qi deficiency; thus, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with poria and half summer should be used. If the meat is red and does not contract, it indicates blood heat; Si Wu Decoction should be increased with gardenia and forsythia. If the meat is pale and does not contract, it indicates spleen deficiency; Si Jun Zi Decoction should be added with wine-fried peony and woodshop. If there is frequent urination, it indicates kidney yin deficiency; Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan should be added. If there is high swelling, pain, and a floating pulse, it signifies an invasion of the exterior; thus, it should be treated with Toli. If there is pain that is stubborn or there is dryness in the throat, it indicates fire in the upper; therefore, it should be purged.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>If there is swelling and pain, or no pus forms, it indicates the stagnation of evil qi, and it should be resolved. If there is swelling and pain accompanied by chills and fever, it signifies heat, and it should be cleared. If there is no pus, or it does not break or constrict, it indicates deficiency of yang qi, and it should be tonified. If the affected flesh does not decay, or if toxins accumulate without resolution, it indicates deficiency of yang qi, and yang qi should be supported. If there is a lot of pus or clear pus, it indicates deficiency of both qi and blood, and it should be replenished vigorously. </p>
<p>If the right guan pulse is weak and the muscles grow slowly, one should strengthen the spleen and stomach. If the initial condition has not surfaced, but there are chills, fever, pain, and thirst with a preference for cold drinks, this indicates latent evil qi; the remedy is Xianfang Huomailing Decoction. If there is dry mouth and thirst, diffuse swelling with slight pain, this indicates deficiency of original qi; the remedy is Tori Xiaodu Powder. With little appetite and thought, with fatigue in the limbs, this indicates weakness of the spleen and stomach; the remedy is Liu Junzi Decoction. If symptoms persist, add ginger and cassia. If there are those who are in critical condition, it indicates excess of evil qi and deficiency of true qi, preventing it from surfacing, typically seen within a ten-day period.</p>
<p>If the condition has already emerged, use Tori Xiaodu Powder. If there is no decay or suppuration, use Tori Powder; if it is unresponsive, urgently warm and tonify the spleen and stomach. If there are critically ill individuals, it indicates that true qi is deficient and cannot decay, typically seen within a two-week period. </p>
<p>If there is already decay and suppuration, use Tori Powder to generate flesh. If it is unresponsive, urgently warm and tonify the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>If there are deaths, it is due to weak Qi of the spleen that cannot consolidate. This condition can be observed over the course of a month. Although these three indicators are not found in classical texts, I have treated and verified them through experience.</p>
<p>When treating the initial stage of a carbuncle that has not formed pus, first apply black gold ointment or aid-life ointment to the affected area a few times to counteract the prevailing condition, and then take the Immortal Vitality Decoction. If appetite is low or the patient is not fond of flavorful foods, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with added sweet basil and take three to five doses. If the outer skin is corrupted, wash it with the arsenic detoxifying powder, applying black gold ointment to the corrupted area daily. When a sore appears, use a piece of paper twisted to dip into black gold ointment and insert it into the sore. If there is pus trapped between the muscle membranes causing swelling and pain, use a needle to draw it out, removing any obstructing rotten flesh. If there is necrotic flesh that is corrupted, wash it with pig&#39;s foot broth. If the pus is thick and painful, while the patient maintains normal eating habits, and the necrotic flesh is naturally decaying, use disinfectant medications along with medicines to remove toxins, and continue applying black gold ointment. If the necrotic flesh has separated from healthy tissue, remove it. If the pus is neither thick nor thin, presenting slight pain and decreased appetite, and the necrotic flesh is decaying slowly, apply moxa to the affected area using mulberry wood and treat with medications that support the interior. If the necrotic flesh does not decay or the pus is clear and thin, and there is no significant pain, take large tonic prescriptions and continue using mulberry wood moxa to replenish the Yang energy and dissipate stagnated toxins, allowing the flesh to decay naturally.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles: Six Essentials</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain Causes</strong></p>
<p>For those who suffer from waist and back pain due to prolonged reading or sitting in games, it is associated with deficiency. The main treatment is Shenqi Decoction, along with Bawei Decoction. Overweight individuals with phlegm, particularly older ones who experience pain alleviated by hitting, are attributed to phlegm and deficiency; they should focus on eliminating dampness and phlegm while also tonifying the spleen and kidneys. </p>
<p>After excessive drinking or eating, if pain occurs with a desire to be hit, it is due to the spleen&#39;s inability to transport, leading to damp heat. One should regulate their diet. Slim individuals often suffer from blood deficiency and Yin deficiency, and they cannot indulge in alcohol or rich foods as a result. Nourishing blood and clearing heat can be achieved with Siwu Decoction, Jiuqing (Wine with Scutellaria), Lian, and paeonia. </p>
<p>For back pain, one should add Qianghuo and Fangfeng to guide treatment along the meridians; overweight individuals should minimize the use of Fuzi. Individuals with a history of deficiency, as well as those recovering from illness or childbirth, may experience heart pain or radiating pain to the sides of the chest or back. This is due to the reversal of vital energy; one must guide it back to the source and should not further relax or press, as it will lead to increased pain. </p>
<p>Those who sweat excessively often suffer from this condition and should focus on warm supplementation. Being bound by pain prevents effective treatment; sweat is the liquid of the heart, and if excessive, it depletes heart fluid and leads to insufficient Yang energy, resulting in pain.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<h3>Cold-Induced Fever</h3>
<p><strong>Aversion to Cold</strong></p>
<p>The back corresponds to Yang, and the abdomen corresponds to Yin. When there is an aversion to cold in the back, it indicates Yang deficiency. When Yang is insufficient, Yin energy becomes excessive; this results in harmony in the mouth. When Yang energy sinks inward, the mouth becomes dry. Aconite and White Tiger Decoction should be examined in detail. When there is harmony in the mouth, but an aversion to cold in the back, it belongs to the Lesser Yin; Aconite Decoction and moxibustion at Qihai (Sea of Qi) is appropriate. When Yang energy sinks inward, leading to a dry mouth and an aversion to cold in the back, White Tiger Decoction is indicated.</p>

<h3>Clinical Guidelines</h3>
<p><strong>Severe Pain</strong></p>
<p>When there is pain in the spine, stiffness in the neck, and the lower back feels broken, with a feeling of pulling in the neck and sudden head pain, it indicates blockage in the Foot Taiyang channel; Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction is the principal remedy. If the pain is due to trauma from falling from a height, with stagnant blood in the Taiyang channel, resulting in unbearable pain in the lower back and spine, Diluolong Decoction is indicated. According to the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; a combination of wind and cold leading to sweating causes pain in the shoulders and back, along with frequent and insufficient urination; this suggests that wind-heat has invaded the lungs, severely obstructing lung qi. You should disperse the wind-heat to promote qi; Fangfeng Decoction is the main remedy. If cold and warm qi are insufficient to rest, and pain in the shoulders and back leads to loss of urination, you should supplement lung qi deficiency with ingredients such as Ginseng and Astragalus. This is self-evident.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Heavenly Pillar Hair, Heart Opposite Hair, and Navel Opposite Hair</p>
<p>If one asks how many types of hair-related sores on the back there are, it is said: there are three types - upper, middle, and lower - all located in the spine and associated with the Governing Vessel. The upper hair is injured in the lungs, appearing below the Heavenly Pillar bone, known as Heavenly Pillar Hair. The middle hair is injured in the liver, referred to as Heart Opposite Hair. The lower hair is injured in the kidneys, known as Navel Opposite Hair. All are caused by accumulated heat and anger. Initially, they may feel like millet, or be itchy, or tense, or not painful, or very painful. At the first sensation, one may apply moxibustion nearby with garlic, or induce sweating, purging, or lifting, assessing their deficiency to implement treatment. For issues at the upper back, one should avoid using licorice due to the risk of leading to deficiency in the lower origin; this is especially important for the elderly and weak. However, the three types of hair on the back are critical areas, differing from others, and should be treated with caution. If there is slight pain or itching, prompt treatment is advisable. For life-saving decoctions, add Qianghuo, Zijingdan, Shengjindan, or Duomingdan. For those strong and robust, one can use one pill of Jindan or Baizhensan for purging. For the elderly and weak, use Huangqi and Muxiang San or Shiquan Dabu Tang for lifting.<br>Yin and Yang sores.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Someone asked: &quot;My back feels numb and varies between swelling and sinking, sometimes soft and sometimes hard, and changes from cold to hot. What does this mean?&quot; The response was: &quot;This is known as Yin-Yang sore, caused by internal disharmony from the seven emotions, leading to imbalance of Yin and Yang. This condition must induce great thirst. If the spirit is clear and the pulse is steady, it can be treated with the lifesaving drink adding Qiang Huo. It may surpass the Golden Elixir or the Life-Draining Elixir when chosen. If the patient is in a state of confusion and agitation, unable to eat and drink, they will die. If yellow or white pus appears within ten days, it can be treated; if there is no pus after several days, they will die.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding avian sore, someone asked: &quot;Suddenly my back feels numb, tight yet painless, with a dozen spots of purple flesh resembling the shape of a fist. What does this mean?&quot; The reply was: &quot;This is known as avian sore. If cold and hot symptoms occur along with mouth lock within seven days, the patient will die. Immediate administration of the lifesaving drink with Qiang Huo and Du Huo, superior to the Golden Elixir and Life-Draining Elixir, is necessary. If there is sweating, it can be treated; if there’s no sweating, it cannot. If the spirit is clear and the pulse is harmonious, it can be treated. If the spirit is confused and pulse irregular, whether rapid or intermittent, they will die. If there is swelling that does not ulcerate, it is advisable to take Tai Ge Zhi Wei pills. In the initial phase of avian sore, if rashes appear, resembling numerous fist-like spots, causing chills and locking of the teeth, the patient will die within fourteen days. If after ten days the pus can be drawn out, recovery is possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding the &quot;Full Sky Stars,&quot; someone asked: &quot;The sore on my back is small at both ends and spreads outwards. What does this mean?&quot; The answer was: &quot;This is known as &#39;two ends developing,&#39; also called &#39;Full Sky Stars&#39; or &#39;Wide Cotton Back Development,&#39; caused by anger leading to heat accumulation. Administer the lifesaving drink adding Qiang Huo and Zi Jin Dan or Sheng Jin Dan. For robust individuals, Eight Array Powder or a single Golden Elixir should be taken. Those who have a high, red, and swollen condition may survive, while those who have a low, sunken, and dark appearance will die.&quot;<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Mouse Bumps (Laoshu Zuan)</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: Between the back and the armpits, what about three or two spots of sores? I replied: This is called &quot;mouse bumps,&quot; also known as &quot;wandering blood spleen sores,&quot; caused by accumulated anger and heat. It often occurs in the Gallbladder and Liver meridians of the feet. It is advisable to use remedies that regulate qi and clear heat, such as Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, Huoming Decoction plus Huanglian and Zhi Zi, and also take Zijing Dan. For strong individuals, a single pill of gold essence should be taken. For the elderly and weak, choose Huangqi Muxiang San or Neibu Shixuan San. If there is no pus after seven days, and if there are signs of black depression and agitation, death is imminent.</p>
<p><strong>Body Sores (Jingtifa)</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: If a sore appears on the back, with unchanged flesh color, slight numbness and itching, firm like the skin of a cow’s neck, measuring two or three feet, what about it? I replied: This is called &quot;body sores,&quot; also known as &quot;pepper eye sores,&quot; caused by exposure to foul air while fasting under the intense heat of summer, and by suppressed anger. It is advisable to use Huoming Decoction plus Qianghuo, or Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, Shengjindan, or Wujin San. For strong individuals, take Bazhen San or a single gold essence pill. If it has not formed pus within seven days, it is advisable to apply garlic moxibustion. If moxibustion produces a sore and the spirit is clear with harmonious pulse, it can be treated; if there is no reaction, and if there is abdominal distention with confusion, a weak or intermittent pulse indicates death. Taking sweating agents to induce sweating indicates survival; without sweating indicates death. If tonic agents cause a rosy appearance and a sore develops, indicating pain, survival is possible; if it expands without food, and is dry and black, death is imminent.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Alcohol Toxicity Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks: &quot;I feel pain on my back and heart area, numbness is not common, with lumps like bullets or fists, hard as stone, pain penetrating deep within, and my body feels constrained; what should I do?&quot; The response is: This is called alcohol toxicity abscess, caused by hunger, excessive eating, physical labor, and the consumption of rich flavors. It is advisable to take Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction with added Qiang Huo and Gan Cao, or Shen Xiao Xiao Du San, internal dispersing Huang Lian Decoction, Zi Jin Ding, or select Sheng Jin Dan. If the spirit is confused and the pulse is chaotic, with great thirst and delirious speech affecting eating, it can be fatal. If there are difficulties with urination and bowel movements, it can also be fatal. If it is caused by cold leading to internal collapse, use Tuo Li Wen Zhong Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Cucumber Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks: &quot;There is an abscess on my back side, two inches high and about a foot long, shaped like a cucumber, with unchanged flesh color; what should I do?&quot; The response is: This is known as cucumber abscess, also called meat abscess, causing pain that affects the heart, along with numbness in the limbs. This condition is often difficult to treat; quickly take Zi Jin Dan, Sheng Jin Dan, and Huo Ming Yin with Qiang Huo and Chai Hu, and select Duo Ming Dan or Shen Xian Chui Du Wan. If the pulse is weak with spontaneous sweating and delirium, it can be fatal. If it is flat and black in color, use Du Jiang San, and take Tai Ge Zi Wei Wan.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Dragon Sores</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;On both sides of the ninth vertebra, there is sudden swelling and pain without a head, with intense cold and heat; what should be done?&quot; The answer: &quot;This is called &#39;Dragon Sores,&#39; which is a condition of the middle jiao, belonging to the Taiyang channel, caused by accumulated heat from anger. For robust individuals, urgently take a grain of gold elixir, or administer &#39;Eight Array Powder.&#39; For life-saving, mix Chaihu, Qianghuo, and Huangqin in equal parts with water and wine and decoct. For the elderly or weak, use Huangqi and Muxiang powder, Neibu Shixuan powder, or choose from Shiquan Dabu Decoction. If the sores are red, raised, and moist, they can be treated. If they are black, sunken, cause nausea, dizziness, with slippery stools and painful urination, accompanied by delirium, this may lead to death.</p>
<p><strong>Dandruff Sores</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;There are countless small spots on the back, soaking two feet in size, like burns from hot water, with agitation and thirst; what should be done?&quot; The answer: &quot;This is dandruff sores, caused by taking strong dan stone medications. If red and moist, the prognosis is good. If dark purple, the prognosis is poor. For those with mild symptoms, take Huanglian Xiaodu powder, Shengjindan, or Guolao ointment. For those with severe symptoms such as unconsciousness, rapid pulse, and swelling with nausea, the prognosis is very poor and may lead to death.&quot;<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Beehive Carbuncle</strong></p>

The answer: This is a beehive carbuncle. Its pulse is weak and slow, with cold limbs, indicating deficiency. This has resulted from excessive consumption of qi-depleting agents and sudden anger. Use the Life-Saving Decoction with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, along with old and young areca nut, green tangerine peel, and cardamom, alternating with the Purple Gold Pill. When pus forms and discharges, take the Complete Nourishing Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Orthodox External Medicine</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong】</p>
<p><strong>Song of the Yang Manifestation on the Back</strong></p>
<p>For abscesses and carbuncles, regardless of being upper, middle, or lower categorized, one must depend solely on the yin and yang to differentiate. Although there are correct and deviant manifestations in beehive carbuncles, one must observe both elevation and depression. When pure yang first arises, it must swell and be tender, accompanied by a slight fever and chills. The top protrudes sharply, resembling the point of a spear, with swelling akin to the root of a bent bow. Within seven days, there is much discomfort, and after fourteen days, pus gradually spreads. Motion and stillness become known, and food is delicious; bowel movements are regular, without diarrhea. As the swelling subsides, pus discharges, and one feels refreshed; rotten flesh gives way, replaced by new vigor and complete blood circulation. Naturally, five good conditions arrive, and seven evils are completely absent. Pain diminishes as pus decreases, swelling recedes and the flesh expands. New flesh begins to bloom, vivid red, while rotten skin retracts and turns pale. The whole body feels light and joyful, and the five organs are in harmony. This belongs to pure yang, easily revivable; a hundred out of a hundred can be ensured peace and safety.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>Song of Yin Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>Pure Yin initially arises with no sores, resembling a grain structure with hard lumps. Not red, not swollen, unaware of pain, subtly warm, slightly rough, with minimal precautions. After seven mornings, the body feels weary, sore roots are even and rejoice in hot broth. The top is not high, the root not alive, the color lacks brightness and decays without grain. Soft, sunken, without pus, empty aggregation, the pulse floats, disperses, large and small, rising and falling. Meals are unconsumed, the body trembles, tasting broth just for the sake of it. On the sores, a covering appears like shedding armor, and the knots in the holes seem to harbor fragrance. Excess pus, foul odors, difficult bodily functions, movements frantic, rhythms don&#39;t last. Sores form purple-black, facial complexion shifts to green-yellow. Spirit foggy and dazed, much snoring during sleep, speech without anyone to express it. Mouth is dry, tongue thick, phlegm and wheezing lead to death. This belongs to pure Yin, which cannot be treated; each hundred can reach the spring town.</p>
<p><strong>Song of Half Yin Half Yang Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>The signs of Yin and Yang interweave, life and death coexist, inviting matters. Mild heat, mild cold, slight redness and swelling, half dazed, half refreshed, half elevated. Though the pulse comes fast, it lacks strength; even with meals, digestion is not easy. Swollen but not ruptured due to weak spleen; ruptured but not confined due to excessive pus. Frequent loose stools, numerous urination, sweating above, dryness below. Although five virtues coexist, seven evils are not fully escaped. Mouth thirsts for broth, abdominal pain; face swells from drink, heart elevated. Heart troubled, unstable sleep, spirit confused, feared sounds disturb. Prescribing according to the condition is wonderful; as Yin turns to Yang, gradual adjustments are possible. True heart creates transformation, your fate is solid and strong. Encountering this is divine intervention; half-dead, the remaining life should not flee.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p>
<h3>Bandaging Method for Back Sores</h3>
<p>When the back sore has burst and is purulent, regardless of winter or summer, it is advisable to use four or five layers of silk cloth, applying a medicinal plaster externally. Additionally, use an eight-inch piece of cotton cloth, securing it with thin snake skin strips at the corners, and place it over the silk to anchor tightly on the sore. This method helps retain warmth within the sore, facilitating the process of decay. When cleaning the sore, prepare two bands for replacement, ensuring that the internal warmth is maintained.</p>
<h3>Chills</h3>
<p>In a case of Shaoyin disease lasting one or two days, if the mouth feels comfortable but there is a sensation of chills in the back, one should use moxibustion and Fuzi soup to treat both internally and externally. If the mouth feels comfortable and neither dry nor thirsty, it indicates no internal pathological evidence. The back is governed by the Governor Vessel, which oversees the rising yang energies; if there is no chill elsewhere but solely in the back, it is evident that there is an abnormality of yang deficiency and the intrusion of yin pathogens. Therefore, both external moxibustion and internal warming should be combined, with the goal of eliminating yin and restoring yang. Those who lack understanding may believe that if the illness has only lasted one or two days and the external symptoms are mild, there is no need for such urgency. However, Zhang Zhongjing highlighted that in just one or two days, signs of yang deficiency and excess yin might already manifest, necessitating early treatment of acute illnesses. Waiting until the third or fourth day will result in a condition that becomes extremely severe and difficult to reverse, rendering it untreatable.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>The heart pains through the back, and the back pains through the heart; this is the chilling energy that reverses upward and obstructs, accumulating between the chest and back meridians, leading to interlinked pain, disrupting the flow of qi and blood, and disturbing its boundaries. If one uses herbs to disperse the qi, it will only intensify the pain and may become perilous. Zhang Zhongjing used the Wutou and Chishizhi pills, incorporating Sichuan pepper and Wutou for their spiciness to disperse the yin evil. Yet, fearing that the chaotic energy in the chest and back would be hard to settle, he included dried ginger and Chishizhi in the warm medicines to fill the obstructed qi paths, allowing the qi in the chest and back to flow freely, preventing mutual interference, thus resolving the ailment. This embodies the essence of transforming stone to mend the heavens. Today, people recognize the methods of warming qi, tonifying qi, moving qi, and dispersing qi, as well as knowing how to clear obstructed paths of evil qi to enable the yin and yang energies of the chest and back to work harmoniously.</p>
<p>As for the pain in the spine, it arises from the depletion of kidney water, which fails to nourish the brain; thus, the pathway of the river cart becomes dry and hard to traverse, leading to pain. Such symptoms cannot be resolved with just one or two doses; it requires prolonged use of tonifying herbs to nourish yin and significantly taking tonics to replenish water for noticeable effect. The formula includes Huangqi and Shudi each one tael, Shanzhuyu and Mai MenDong each four qian, Beiwuweizi one qian, Baizhu five qian, Fangfeng five fen, and Fuling three qian, with Fuzhu one fen, boiled in water for oral administration.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>In this prescription, to tonify Qi, there are Astragalus and Atractylodes; to nourish the essence, there are prepared Rehmannia and Chinese Wolfberry; to dispel dampness, there is Poria; to expel wind, there is Siler; to guide the efficacy, there is Aconite; and there is also Ophiopogon to nourish the source of kidney water. Naturally, when Metal is strong, it produces Water; when Water is sufficient, the path of the river cart will not be dry. If it is not dry, then Metal will be moistened and bones nourished, so why suffer from pain? If there is no pain, then why is the back not straight? Yet, this prescription will not show results overnight; it requires prolonged use to be effective.</p>
<p>For someone suffering from back pain, people might think it is a heart issue, but in reality, it is due to the disruption of the bladder&#39;s Qi. Consequently, the upper body is obstructed, resulting in pain. The method here should clear the fire of the bladder to alleviate the pain in the back. The bladder is the organ associated with the kidneys; when the kidneys are deficient, the bladder is also weak. The spine acts as the pathway of the river cart, with the bladder operating through the kidney&#39;s channel, hence the discomfort in the back.</p>
<p>The prescription includes one tael of prepared Rehmannia, three fen of cinnamon, three qian each of Plantago seed and Alisma, and five qian each of Job&#39;s tears, Poria, and Euryale seed, decocted in water to take as two doses. This allows for the large passage of the bladder&#39;s water route, and the back pain will also subside. Prepared Rehmannia is the supreme agent for tonifying the kidneys, and with sufficient kidneys, the bladder&#39;s Qi will also be strong. Moreover, with Poria, Plantago, and Job&#39;s tears to help drain the water, and cinnamon to guide the various herbs to the bladder to unblock its Qi, naturally the fluids will flow and the fire will disperse, resolving any stagnation. What issue would remain? This is why the treatment is effective.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>Crack Revealing Snake Lice</strong></p>
<p>If a person suddenly experiences pain in their back, a crack opens, and a snake about two feet long jumps out, it is very good at leaping. I have personally treated this and confirmed the symptoms: there must first be severe pain in the spine without swelling; if it lasts long, swelling will occur, and a snake approximately one foot long will grow, seemingly standing upright on the spine. I then lightly cut the skin with a knife, and the snake jumps out, startling the person immensely. I treated this with one tael of ginseng, three qian each of pinellia and rhizoma arisaema, and one qian of aconite; it suddenly revived. A flesh-repairing powder was applied to the affected area, and it healed.</p>
<p>If a person has a crack in the spine from which over a thousand lice emerge, this is due to wind in the kidneys being blown by yang energy, leading to the unnoticed rupture and appearance of lice. The prescription uses three taels each of cooked rehmannia and cornus fruit, one tael of eucommia, five qian of white atractylodes, one qian of twining vine, and three qian of equal-leaved sweet herb; two doses for the crack will completely kill the lice.</p>
<p>There is also another recipe using three seeds of castor bean, ground into a paste, and three red dates, pounded into balls the size of a marble, burned and then smoked on clothes; this will kill the lice and heal the crack.

<p>These eleven ingredients serve to treat internal blockages. Take with rice wine using a spoon, allowing the medicine to flow into the sore. If the carbuncles cannot break after moxibustion, or if they are already rotten, you may take this medicine. For those not rotten, omit the bitter herb; for those that have begun to suppurate, include the bitter herb. Take the medicine seven to eight times a day and two to three times at night; more is better. </p>
<p>If the condition is in the lower body, the pus and blood will emerge, indicating intestinal carbuncles. For various internal diseases, simply taking this medicine allows one to feel its effectiveness; pain will cease. Regular use means omitting the bitter herb. It treats all kinds of sores, carbuncles, hemorrhoids; for women, it helps with milk fever that has already ulcerated for quicker recovery. </p>

<p><strong>Shen Yi Ointment</strong> – Treats all kinds of carbuncles and furuncles.</p>
<p>Take one liang of peeled and sliced apricot kernel, one liang of cleaned bee&#39;s nest, and the more bees, the better. Clean and dry one liang of snake’s skin washed in salt water. Take half a liang each of original root and astragalus, three fen of astragalus, and five liang of yellow lead, finely ground. The messy hair of a man, cleaned and dried, about the size of a chicken egg, uses one jin of real hemp oil.</p>
<p>For preparation: first, place the hemp oil in a silver mortar, mix it with the messy hair, and slowly simmer it over a gentle flame until the hair is charred and completely melted. When this happens, add in the apricot kernels and wait for them to change color. Then filter the oil through fine cotton to remove any residue. Next, put the strained oil back into the silver mortar and add the two herbs, original root and astragalus, simmering them over a low fire for one to two hours. Remove the mortar and place it on a cool hearth, waiting for about half an hour until the heat subsides. Then quickly add the cleaned bee&#39;s nest and snake’s skin, and stir with a willow branch while keeping the mortar over the fire, constantly stirring until it reaches a yellow-purple color. After filtering again through cotton, pour in the clean oil and rapidly mix in the yellow lead. Then return the mortar to the fire, stirring constantly over a low flame until the oil turns black. When droplets fall into water and form beads, the ointment is complete.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>If the paste is scarce, simmer for a little longer, and it will be ready. Then use a ceramic container to seal and store it for future use. If there is a concern that it may have been overheated and becomes too hard to use, add a little wax and mix in sesame oil, placing it in a ceramic container to steam over boiling water, stirring well while hot, and then store it. Once the ointment is completed, it is essential to place the ceramic container in a basin of clean water to draw out the harmful heat for a full day and rest for three days before it can be used. The process of preparing this ointment is very sensitive to the temperature; one must patiently monitor the heat carefully, as too strong a fire will cause the paste to overheat—this precaution is paramount! The formula for the ointment is numerous, but those that are effective are unmatched by this one.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p>

<p>To treat abscesses and all kinds of poisonous sores, preemptive use prevents toxins from entering the body. </p>
<p>Take one pound of true sesame oil, heat it in a silver vessel until it boils several times, then let it cool. </p>
<p>Next, take two bowls of wine and combine with five cups of oil. Consume it hot through the mouth, finishing it in one day; if slow, take it over several days. </p>

<p>Sesame oil clears heat and toxins from the lower energizers and relieves gas stagnation in the large and small intestines. If sores begin to develop with toxins accumulating inside, or if constipation occurs, using it to facilitate detoxification is indeed a good method. However, if constipation is not present and there is excessive heat in the lower energizers, it may not be appropriate; one should examine the condition carefully before use.</p>

<p>Use a soft cloth to cover the sore, without opening the sores excessively, to avoid draining vital energy. Note: All back sores classified as yin are due to the internal organs deteriorating first, with internal toxins not able to surface outwardly.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>In the past, methods such as using a chicken comb to cut and let blood drip onto the sore, applying vinegar-boiled male mugwort, using pig brain heat medicine as a poultice, and using divine lamp heat to cauterize were all treatments for yin sores. Although I have tried these, I have not seen significant results. However, when a yin sore does not develop, it is like the roots of a tree becoming rotten; cultivating the branches and leaves vigorously does not lead to growth. I have tried using medications according to principle, and it is true that out of ten cases, three or four can recover.</p>
<p>This is akin to agriculture: one must first loosen the soil, unblock the land veins, support the roots, and revive the yang energy. Each of these four steps is essential. Use astragalus, magnolia bark, Poria, and dried tangerine peel to unblock the upper part, and use light artemisia, angelica, chaff, and safflower to open the veins. For the roots, use ginseng, astragalus, goji berries, and mountain cornel to support them, while aconite, lemongrass, licorice, and angelica can revive the yang. If used in this way, as long as there is still a pulse of vitality within the roots, taking these can lead to recovery.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the hands and feet feel warm, the sores produce heat, gradually swelling occurs, and the pain returns, with dark colors indicating vitality and hardness indicating decay, while stomach energy is restored, then this is a sign of the efficacy of the medicine. It should manifest as auspicious within three doses. Additionally, externally, complementary methods to assist in reviving yang are to be combined, as this constitutes the great method for treating yin sores.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>The divine lamp illuminates the method. When treating initial furuncles, seven days before and after, those not fully formed will dissolve on their own, while those that are formed will burst. For those not erupting, they will erupt, and for those not rotting, they will rot; this is indeed a good method. </p>

Each use three fen, wrap the medicine in cotton paper to form a stick about a foot long, and moisten it thoroughly with genuine hemp oil, then burn like a lamp. Hold it about half an inch away from the sore, shining it from the outside in, moving gently around, with the flame pointing upwards to allow the medicinal vapors to enter. The toxins of the sore will dissipate with the fire, preventing them from invading the internal organs. Start with three sticks, gradually increasing to four or five, observing as the sores gradually diminish. After fumigation, continue applying the topical medicine. If the sore has already burst and pus is discharging, there is no need to use this method; it is better to use a plaster to cover it.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br><strong>Application of Medicine</strong>: For treating back boils, first shine a divine lamp on the area, then apply this medicine. </p>

If it’s just starting out, also add two or three points of flying salt powder, mixing them into a thick paste to apply over the sore, leaving a small peak for the ointment to cover. Avoid wind, as it will naturally draw out the pus and toxins.</p>

<li>A piece of fresh bamboo roughly the thickness of 3-4 cm (1.2-1.5 inches) and about 18 cm (7 inches) long, leaving a joint at one end. Remove the outer green with a knife, leaving a white inner section about 0.3 cm (1/10 inch) thick. Drill a small hole near the joint, tightly sealing it with a willow stick. Place the powdered herbs inside the tube, sealing the open end with scallions. Place the tube horizontally in a pot, weighting it down to prevent it from floating. Use 10 bowls of clear water to boil the tube until the medicine is richer and thoroughly cooked, and then remove it for future use.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>Using a beryllium needle, place it within an inch above the top of the sore, and create three openings in a pattern. Insert it to a shallow depth, approximately within the boundary of the tube. Connect the medicinal tube to the decoction and store it in a large ceramic bowl. In front of the patient, pour out the contents of the tube and, while hot, apply the open end of the tube to the sore, pressing it down firmly with your hand, allowing it to naturally adhere. After a while, when the tube has warmed, remove the wooden plug from the hole, and the tube should come off by itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examine the contents poured out of the tube. If you see a mixture of pus and blood that is bright red and yellow in color, roughly equivalent to one or two cups, this indicates an active sore, which will definitely heal with treatment. However, if the contents are purely decomposed blood, with foul, dark purple-black characteristics, thin and watery without signs of pus, this indicates that the energy and blood are severely depleted inside, with non-vital muscle tissue, signifying a dead sore, which cannot be cured even with forceful treatment. </p>
<p>This method is a family tradition and has been verified many times. For sores that easily rupture and produce pus, this method should not be used, as it would harm the energy and blood. It can only be applied to stagnant sores, ideally those that are firm, don’t rupture, and don’t produce pus about fifteen days prior. This method has the potential to restore vitality, and it is essential for practitioners of medicine to know it.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br><strong>Angelica Wine</strong>: Treats阴疽 (yin abscess).<br>5 qian of dried ginger, 4 qian of angelica, 2 qian each of costus and white atractylodes.

<p>For treating back sores, Mica stone powder is very good; it is a secret recipe from the hermit Lü Zihua of Mount Zhongyue. Take Mica stone, which varies in size - some are like fists, some like goose eggs, others like cakes, generally resembling a gathered mass. The stone has small grains that appear like beans or rice, and is either yellow or white; it can be found among the gravelly stones in streams. Crush the stone into pieces the size of chess pieces, then heat it in charcoal until it glows red. Soak it in rice vinegar for ten times, then grind it into a fine powder. Place it in a mortar and grind further for five to seven days until it reaches a very fine texture, amounting to four ounces; take one set of deer antlers, preferably fresh with the brain bone intact; those that have shed are not usable. Cut them into two or three-inch pieces, char them until the smoke stops, then grind into a fine powder, amounting to two ounces; take two ounces of white peony root, grind it into powder, and boil in three-year-old rice vinegar inside a silver vessel, bringing it to a boil; then add the other powdered ingredients while stirring continuously with a bamboo branch. Cook for one or two hours until the desired consistency is achieved, then cool in a basin, covering it with paper to keep out dust. When using, apply with a goose feather over the swelling and the surrounding areas that are red, leaving an area the size of a coin to allow for air escape.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>If there is pus, it can be dissipated within; if it forms a head, it should be pressed small; if it has burst, the pus should be expelled like rushing water. If the illness has lasted long and the flesh is rotting away, exposing the tendons and bones, then apply fine cloth to cover it, changing it when dry, with the wound gradually closing day by day. However, if it has sunk into a cavity, it will not heal. For those that have burst, first wash away the pus and blood with pig’s hoof broth, then dry the area with cloth before applying medication. It is crucial to avoid touching the tender flesh with hands and do not blow air from the mouth onto it. Also, avoid contact with the scent of armpits, menstruating women, and pregnant individuals; these are to be avoided in conjunction with medication. Initially, wash and change once a day; after ten days, change every two days. The medication must be extremely fine to be effective. If not finely ground, application will cause extreme pain. This method has been noted in Sun Zhenren&#39;s &quot;Qianjin&quot; and is comprehensive in detail. Additionally, during the Northern Qi era, Ma Siming treated Yang Zunyan&#39;s back sore by taking coarse yellow stone, about the size of an egg, heating it strong fire until red, immersing it in strong vinegar, allowing impurities to fall into the vinegar, then heating and steeping it until finished. The resulting particles should be sun-dried, ground to an extremely fine powder, mixed with vinegar, and applied, leading to immediate healing. Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Chuanxin Fang&quot; referred to it as the stone refining method, validated for treating swellings and sores.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>When a rash initially appears on the back, accompanied by intense chills, or if sores and swellings have already developed: take three or two pieces of stone powder, calcine it, soak it in one liter of water until dissolved, fold a blue cloth three times, apply it to the reddened area while warm, and change it as soon as it heats up, frequently replacing it for recovery. </p>

<p>In the early stages of back pain: One sheng of fresh cassia seeds, crushed, one liang of fresh licorice, and three sheng of water, boiled down to one sheng, taken in two doses.

<p>Another method: Burn deer antlers to ash, mix with vinegar and apply it, changing five to six times a day.</p>
<p>For early-stage poisonous swelling on the back: Use a live toad, place it on the sore for half a day until it becomes sluggish, then put it in water to revive; replace with another toad, and repeat the method until the toad becomes unsteady; once it returns to normal, the poison will have dispersed. This has shown strong effectiveness upon repeated trials. If the condition is severe, take one or two or three live toads, open their bellies, and use them warm on the sore; it will soon become malodorous, and replacing them two or three times will lead to a cure.

<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: For the foot taiyang malarial fever, one experiences waist pain and heavy-headedness, with cold rising from the back; first cold, then heat, with feverish discomfort and difficulty sweating once the heat subsides. Needle the xue point for bleeding. The malarial pulse is fast and full; needle the back-shu points and the five hu points, regulating for both fat and thin. If neck or back pain occurs first, needle that area first.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>Wind-cold malaria causes sweating and aversion to wind when it attacks; it should be treated by needling the back points of the three yang meridians. In the case of lung heat illness, the heat leads to wheezing and coughing, causing pain that radiates through the chest and back, preventing deep sighing, accompanied by severe headaches, sweating accompanied by chills, and when the heat is intense, it can lead to death. Needling the hand&#39;s taiyin and yangming points can help by drawing blood like the size of a large bean, which provides immediate relief. </p>
<p>Needling along the spine&#39;s intervertebral spaces, especially the mid-spinal cord, is significant. For deep and serious conditions, needling the major organs is essential. If there is an accumulation in the lower abdomen, needle the spaces on either side of the spine around four vertebrae and around the iliac crests at the sides of the ribs, guiding the Qi and heat from the abdomen downward.</p>
<p>When pain in the back is related to the heart, treatment should focus on the Tian Tui point and the ten vertebrae along with the upper and lower junctures; the upper juncture refers to the stomach area, while the lower juncture refers to the Guanyuan point. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: for the foot taiyang branch, called Feiyang, located seven cun above the ankle, it branches to flow into the shaoyin. If there is fullness, it causes stuffiness and pain in the head and back; if there is deficiency, it leads to nasal hemorrhage, addressing the branches. </p>
<p>The branch of the Governing Vessel is called Changqiang; it runs along the spine to the nape, dispersing headaches and extending to the shoulders, left and right it branches into the taiyang, entering and mingling with the ribs. In cases of fullness, the spine becomes stiff; when deficient, there is a heavy sensation in the head; to alleviate it, treat the blood network in the popliteal area of the foot taiyang. </p>

All these points are three inches away from the spine. To verify these points, you should press on them; if it hurts, then it is indeed their point. Moxa can be used, but needles should not. If there is excess Qi, reduce it; if deficient, then tonify it. When using fire for tonification, do not blow on the flames; it should extinguish by itself. When using fire for reduction, blow on the flames swiftly, and for moxa, ensure it goes out.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Coffer&quot; states that drinking alcohol is a major contraindication for moxibustion on the abdomen and back, as it can lead to intestinal blockage. The &quot;Classic of the Shell and the Green&quot; states that if there is pain or inability to lift the shoulder and back, it indicates blood stagnation in the shoulder, governed by the large bone. If one cannot wear clothes by themselves, and experiences pain on the outer side of the arm and wrist, it indicates the Yang Valley point. If there is a desire to break the shoulder with pain radiating downward, and the hand cannot move up or down independently, it indicates the Elderly Support point.

<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: The separated void governs back cold and shivering, insufficient breath; with cold chills, crossing both hands leads to dizziness. If the condition is full, there is heat in the back, sweating, and limbs swelling violently; if empty, there is shoulder cold and shivering, with insufficient breath. </p>
<p>The attached points govern back pain that radiates to the head.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>The diaphragm, the border of the spine, and the vital bones govern the pain from cold in the back, causing stiffness that makes it difficult to bend or look up. The fish region governs the numbness that spreads across the chest and back, making it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>The channel and hill ruins relate to acute sensations in the chest and back, with a feeling of fullness in the chest. All occurrences of back issues are caused by consuming the five-stone cold food and Shengsheng powder; there are also those who suffer by merely taking bellflower. Additionally, some develop back issues despite not having taken anything throughout their lives. This is noted in the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text, volume twenty-two as a remedy. These are cases from previous generations who consumed such.</p>
<p>The condition commonly begins between the shoulder blades, initially resembling the size of a grain of millet, accompanied by either pain or itchiness while appearing red. At first, people do not regard it as serious, but over ten days it may grow larger, potentially leading to death. At its worst, it can extend three inches wide and one inch high, with dozens of sores. Pressing on it will release pus from all the holes, and the voice may be lost.</p>
<p>Therefore, for maintenance of health, when one feels an unusual itch or pain in the back, it is urgent to take pure earth, mix it with water to make a paste, and form into cakes that are two-finger thick and one and a half inches wide. Use coarse moxa to create sticks, and apply them to the sore where the mud cake is placed. Change the cake with each stick. When the sore is the size of a grain of millet, seven cakes will suffice for healing. If it is the size of a catalpa seed, use seven times seven sticks for treatment. If it is the size of a coin, treatment is not limited by the number of sticks used both day and night. Also, take the Five Spice Lonicera and Iron Juice to help combat the condition for healing.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>Another method: For the condition of back boils that have not developed into large pus accumulations, one can apply cold water to shoot at them, soak stones to cool and press them against the boils, continuously day and night without stopping, until healing occurs. This ailment is sensitive to face, wine, and five pungent flavors. Sometimes boils arise on both shoulders. </p>
<p>In general, when swelling appears between the shoulder blades, the head becomes white like millet, with the edges connected, and the swelling is red and black, causing confusion, it is called back boils. One should avoid rooms, meat, and garlic. If not treated with moxibustion, it may lead to severe internal consequences. If using moxibustion, it should be applied to the sore vigorously, with seven or eight hundred vigorous touches. Some who are unknowledgeable mistakenly treat it with mixed methods, which can lead to death.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Medical Essentials&quot;: There are two methods for acupuncture and moxibustion for back pain: </p>
<p>First, treat the lungs. The scriptures state that lung disease can cause coughing and shortness of breath, with pain in the shoulders and back, and sweating occurs. Treat along the channels of the Taiyin foot and the Yangming hand; if there is excessive energy, shoulder and back pain occurs; if there is wind, cold, and sweat, pain from lack of energy may feel cold, with insufficient breath, viewing the conditions of excess and deficiency is vital.</p>
<p>Second, treat the kidneys. The scriptures state that if there is evil in the kidneys, it can cause pain in the shoulder, back, and neck, sometimes with dizziness. Treat at the Yongquan and Kunlun points, and if there is blood, address it thoroughly.</p>
<p>For shoulder and back pain affecting the scapula: focus on the scapular seam, below the shoulder blade, directly to the tip of the armpit, taking two and a half inches, with a draining technique followed by absorption; for the cervical spine, two and a half inches, perform eight drains and absorptions.</p>
<p>For shoulder and scapular pain, treat at the Kunlun, Xuanzhong, and Jianjing points.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>Shoulder and back pain, along with pain in the neck and armpit that radiates to the chest, can be treated by taking one point from the Yongquan (Kidney 1) and the treatment is particularly effective when blood is drawn. For pain in the front armpit, puncture one inch into the area. </p>
<p>Another method: locate the Qi She (Spleen 6) five tenths (0.5) and moxibustion at Tianliao (BL 33); also take one and a half inches from Qu Pool (LI 11) and five tenths (0.5) from Tianjing (TH 5). </p>
<p>For shoulder and back pain, the heart of treatment is Sanli (ST 36). </p>
<p>For treating spine pain and stiffness, there are three methods: First, targeting the Du Meridian. The text states: the branch of the Du Meridian is called Changqiang and passes through the Yang channel, indeed addressing stiffness in the spine. </p>
<p>Second, take the Foot Yangming (ST 36). The text mentions: when pain obstructs the spine and culminates at the top, the head feels heavy, vision is unclear, and there’s stiffness in the lower back, it can be treated by taking the blood vessels in the popliteal fossa of the Foot Yangming channel. </p>
<p>Third, target the Small Intestine. The text states: when the lower abdomen constrains the testicles, it pulls the lower back upwards and affects the heart due to an evil present in the Small Intestine. Treat by dispersing it at the Huangyuan (BL 20), and puncture points beneath Taiyin (SP 3) and Jueyin (PC 6) to eliminate it.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>If there is pain in the spine and waist, acupuncture should be applied at the point between the mouth and the center, inserting the needle three lines deep, slightly upward, but draining without supplementing, leaving it in for three breaths. For the Weizhong point, insert two and a half inches, avoiding moxibustion; furthermore, at the surrounding purple veins, remove blood that resembles vine lumps, but do not let it bleed. Continuous bleeding can lead to death. Drain the Sanli and Wushui points. </p>
<p>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases&quot; states: The effective moxibustion with mulberry branches treats the condition of back pain not resolving, or bruised flesh that does not break open. This indicates weak Yang energy. Use mulberry branches to light a fire, extinguish the flame, and apply the heat to the affected area for a while, three to five times a day, to assist with the swelling&#39;s resolution. If rotten flesh has already cleared and new flesh is slow to grow, it is advisable to use moxibustion around the area. This method is also appropriate for chronic yin sores and scrofula that do not heal. Generally, if the condition has not ruptured, it helps resolve heat toxins, alleviates pain, and reduces swelling; if it has ruptured, then it reinforces Yang energy, disperses remaining toxins, and generates new flesh. For Yang-related swelling pain, which might feel heavier than a stone, initially using this method will expel toxic fluid, enabling internal resolution; for long-standing issues, even if it ruptures, it will remain shallow and cause no suffering. Unfortunately, patients are often unaware of this approach, and practitioners are reluctant to use it.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The garlic moxibustion method treats all poisonous sores that cause severe pain in the back, whether painful or numb. If it is painful, moxibustion should be applied until the pain stops; if it is not painful, apply until it hurts, and the poison will disperse with the heat. Fire opens and draws out the stagnant poison; this is a therapeutic method with the power to rejuvenate. Use peeled garlic, cut into slices as thick as coins, and place them on the sore. Then put moxa on top of the garlic and conduct moxibustion three times, replacing the garlic each time. If the sore is not yet formed, it will disappear; if it has formed, it will also reduce the severity and cause no harm. For larger sores, mash the garlic and spread it over the affected area, then place moxa on top and burn it until the garlic becomes ineffective, then replace it. If there is no pain or pus, or if it does not swell or is a hidden sore, it is especially advisable to apply moxibustion more frequently. If there is still no pain, no pus, and no swelling, it is not treatable. This indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood. Li states: For back abscesses that are swollen without a head, use damp paper to cover the swollen area, with just a small part dry to indicate the sore head.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>You can use ten cloves of garlic, half a basket of fermented soybeans, and a portion of frankincense, crush them into a paste and apply it to the sore. Cover it with moxibustion, using the garlic method to gauge the pain. If the previous case involved bone abscesses or the initial emergence of toxins in the buttocks and legs, a quick application of moxibustion often helps dissipate the toxins from within. If the toxins are severe, taking the Lifesaving Decoction will be even more effective. If one has a deficiency of qi and blood, one must focus on strengthening supplements. If a back abscess has ulcerated significantly and you want to check if it has penetrated the inner membrane, do not use the soap herb to induce sneezing. Instead, cover the affected area with paper and have the patient breathe intentionally; if the paper does not move, it has not penetrated. If you induce sneezing, you may disturb the inner membrane and cause penetration, so be very cautious! The &quot;Wushi Fang Lun&quot; states that the occurrence of boils and abscesses on the back has its reasons, as discussed in detail within the text. Whenever you first notice redness and swelling, start from the second depression along the spine and both sides, one and a half inches away from the body&#39;s center, called the hot viscera points, and moxibust each of these spots seven times.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>This can disperse the excessive yang heat, ensuring there is no suffering from sores and boils. If garlic moxibustion is performed separately and regardless of the number of treatments, then the pathogen will have no place to reside, and the vital energy will not be harmed. In cases where sores appear on the head and neck, one should apply moxibustion to the ridges of the bamboo stick and at the point of Zusanli.</p>
<p>According to the Wu family: In treating boils and sores, if a lesion is painless, one must apply moxibustion to induce pain; if it is painful, one must apply moxibustion until it is painless. If pain occurs immediately during moxibustion, it indicates that the toxic heat is superficial; if it does not hurt, the toxicity is deeper. It is necessary to take internal medicine to eliminate toxins and expel pus, and apply external disinfectant medications. Generally, boils and sores should be painful but not excessively so. If there is a feeling of discomfort without pain, it is hard to treat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When the yang energy converges and is attacked by cold, it transforms into heat; if the heat becomes severe, the flesh will rot into pus. Most cases of sores occurring on the back are due to the consumption of metals and stones, and some are a result of past ingestion. The manifestations often occur on the skin, appearing like millet grains, may hurt or itch, and are often fatal.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>The outside resembles a fist; the ancients said: the outside is like hemp, the inside like a melon. There are dozens of holes; when pressed by hand, pus comes out from all the holes, and after a while, it loses sensation. For anyone with this condition, one can use purified water from a clean source to adjust the size into a cake shape, about an inch thick, and burn mugwort atop it. Internally, take a decoction of Five-Spice and Forsythia, and apply a mixture of iron paste and vinegar with clam shell powder. Additionally, utilize the horseback riding method of moxibustion; this is very effective. I foolishly suggest that the previous evidence still refers to the main treatment discussed, fearing that the differences in exterior and interior heat toxins and the varying strengths of vital energy may cause confusion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said: those with boils on the back have thin skin and raised swelling, often with dozens of pepper-like eyes; those with ulcers have hard skin, resembling the hide of an ox neck. Both conditions are suitable for moxibustion; once a boil has formed pus, it ought to be needled. The needle should be made of horse-bit iron, shaped like a chive leaf, sharp on both sides, allowing for horizontal or vertical incisions of about five to six inches to draw out toxic blood, which will alleviate the illness immediately. It is essential to cauterize first before making the incision.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>One can take divine pills to counteract poison, which effectively removes the root of the poison. Next, one should use medications like those for expelling pus and treating internal conditions. When the sore becomes purulent, it is advisable to cauterize it: use a silver spatula about an inch wide and six inches long, heat it red hot, and frequently cauterize the affected area until the pus flows out, which is the desired effect. Generally speaking, abscesses and sores are more difficult to treat than various other ailments; without the subtle teachings passed down from heart to heart, how can they be easily cured? </p>
<p>In my humble opinion, if there is sufficient energy and blood, pus will form; one should quickly lance it, as it may not be healed with medication. However, if energy and blood are deficient and pus cannot flow out, or if pus flows but causes pain, it is essential to support the internal organs and nourish the stomach, to ensure a favorable outcome. </p>
<p>Mr. Wu stated: If one feels redness, itchiness, swelling, or pain between the shoulder blades, or sees white spots, one should moisten the area with saliva and avoid scratching. Generally, if there are slight red and swollen points on the back, it may result from scratching, bathing, or from consuming spicy or grilled foods. At first, without differentiating the symptoms, one should keep the area moist and sometimes use ink to circle it. If it becomes swollen and red, it is best to promptly apply moxa in the center of the circle.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>Everyone doubts that excessive heat from fire often leads to prolonged suffering; many are misled. I foolishly note that when a sore appears on the back and shoulder, if there is darkened flesh rotting and pus flowing, and pain persists, it indicates that there is a layer of sinew in between, preventing the internal pus from escaping. A needle should be used to draw it out. For the elderly and weak, if one waits for it to erupt on its own, it often results in a lack of salvation; treatment must be careful. </p>
<p>Pain in the area may or may not be present and can be numb; this is due to excess evil qi, which should be treated with garlic moxibustion. For areas without pain, moxibustion should continue until pain arises, and for painful areas, it should continue until the pain subsides, dispersing the toxins with the heat. If pain persists, it requires clear moxibustion.</p>
<p>If there is swelling, hardness, deep pain, and a solid pulse, the evil is internal and must be addressed accordingly. </p>
<p>The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states that for long-standing cases of cold damage, shoulder and back pain will improve simply by needling the Zhongzhu point; for spinal pain, needling the Renzhong point is especially effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Eastern Medicine Treasure Mirror&quot; states that back pain often arises from overexertion, especially among those diligent in their trades and among men and women who work hard. Those who are overworked also suffer from this condition; the best remedy is moxibustion at the Huang point.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: For back pain and swelling, the guiding method is: rub the palms together ninety-nine times, then apply the heat by pressing on both shoulders alternately. Bend and exert force, moving back and forth according to the count of ninety-nine, and perform the energy adjustment. The energy adjustment involves practicing the small and large circles on the back. After practicing, let your fingers spread the stagnant energy from the fingertips; this applies to pains as well. If there is pain on the left, move to the left; if on the right, move to the right. If both sides are painful, practice separately for each side. For back sores, perform energy adjustments focused on the affected area, or push to open the lung meridian to wash the kidney water. </p>
<p>Additionally: the back calming method. Therefore, beginners should sit quietly for a while, clearing all thoughts, concentrating and setting their intention in the cavity of the back at the acupoint. Initially, chant &quot;Taiyi Saves from Suffering&quot; aloud, gradually returning this chant to the heart and then to the back, maintaining a state of emptiness and tranquility. From thoughts of existence return to the state of non-existence; the spirit will become empty and responsive.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Eastern Q by Qi&quot; states: A relative of the clique was a magistrate in Linchuan, who, throughout his life, was frail and weak, often consuming substances like black (dragon), aconite, and vermilion. In his later years, a sore developed on his back, growing to the size of a fan. The doctors attributed it entirely to the poison from the vermilion and stone. They tried various detoxifying items, such as mulberry and bean powder, and sheep&#39;s blood, but with no effect. Someone recommended the old healer Zhu from the market, who was known as a sore specialist but was particularly precise in his diagnosis. After examining his pulse, he said: &quot;I do not wish to contradict what others may think, but this is indeed a case of extreme yin. According to my methods, he should take more of the fire-suppressing vermilion and Sanjian decoction; otherwise, it is beyond my knowledge.&quot; The doctors&#39; sons all seemed troubled, yet the patient was in a dire state, so they cautiously tried one or two small doses, while Zhu insisted on a larger dosage to be taken immediately. Three days later, they began applying an ointment, while continuing to take the vermilion and aconite without interruption. After more than half a month, the sore healed completely. In total, he took Sanjian decoction two hundred and fifty times, which can indeed be called exceptional skill. Hong Jinglu recorded that Kangzu suffered from a heart-related hemorrhoid and used &quot;Holy Benefit Formula&quot; to treat back pain, with deer antler and aconite, which led to improvement. Similarly, Guo, a physician from Fuzhou, used antler and aconite to treat leaking hemorrhoids, and such cases are numerous. Indeed, sores and abscesses manifest both yin and yang symptoms, and it is essential to determine this through pulse examination. However, contemporary surgeons often lack proficiency in pulse diagnosis, frequently relying on personal conjecture, which results in many errors; this is something that must be examined with precision.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>The &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; states: A person developed a boil on their back, and after more than a month of treatment, the condition worsened significantly. There was a man named Zhang who advised using moxa to burn the area, applying it up to one hundred and fifty times, stopping only when the pain was felt. The next day, when the black scabs were tweezed away, the pus was completely drained, and the flesh was all red and no longer painful. A medicinal plaster was then applied, changed daily, and during the changes, the black and rotten parts were trimmed. After more than a month, it healed completely.</p>
<p>The &quot;Chuang Yang Quan Shu&quot; states: A man aged sixty developed a back boil after the winter solstice. After five to seven days, the swelling extended about seven inches, and because the opening was delayed, it began to change. He felt the sore was as heavy as carrying a stone, burning like fire, and the pain was double the usual. The pulse was deep and rapid, and pressing on it revealed strength. This was a transformation due to excess heat from rich foods and the presence of severe pathogenic heat, which needed to be treated with cold medicine. It was a harsh winter month, and there was a caution against using cold medicine excessively. Thus, one might think of the Inner Canon and its guidance: when conditions are contrary to the season, one may still proceed according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>A man had a hunchback and a gradually shortening neck. When asked about the cause, he attributed it to eating drought-dwelling turtles. For treatment, purple shiso was boiled into a broth to wash the area, after which he applied tortoise urine. To obtain tortoise urine, one would place a tortoise in a vessel and shine a mirror on it, which would induce urination.</p>
<p>In another case, a man developed a lump on his back, feeling mentally exhausted and physically weak, with loss of appetite. A physician diagnosed it as a lice boil and recommended surgical removal. After cleansing with licorice soup and drying the area, he used an old wooden comb ground into ash, mixed it with sesame oil, and applied it, resulting in immediate healing.</p>
<p>According to &quot;The Teachings of the Scholar on Caring for Parents,&quot; there was a wealthy girl, over ten years old, who loved to eat purple cherries, consuming two to three pounds each time and repeating this every year for over a decade. One day, feeling feverish as if from labor, a practitioner examined her and found her pulse to be strong and forceful, predicting that she would eventually suffer from festering sores and toxic swelling, with heat rising to affect her eyes, leading to an excess of yang and depletion of yin. Her family was enraged and refused to accept detoxifying medicine. Within a year or two, she developed a boil on her back as large as a plate, causing unbearable pain. She recalled the practitioner’s words and repeatedly sought his help, apologizing. He used a golden needle to prick around the boil hundreds of times, extracting a bucket of blood over three treatments, gradually reducing the pain and swelling, with slight pus discharge. As a scab began to form, he advised her to take a tonic and internal herbal powder, leading to her recovery. She avoided certain foods for the rest of her life, but her vision remained dim, and she remained childless.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A man suddenly suffers from a sharp pain along the seam of his shoulder and back, extending from the shoulder across to the front of the chest and stopping at the side of the abdomen. The pain persists day and night, unbearable, with a pulse that is taut and rapid, showing a stronger left side than the right. The area of the back and shoulder relates to the small intestine meridian, while the chest and abdomen relate to the gallbladder meridian. This is certainly due to excessive thinking and worry harming the heart; although the organs themselves are not sick, the bowels are affected first. Therefore, the pain arises from the back and shoulder, stemming from indecision in thought, which eventually connects to the gallbladder, leading to pain in the chest and side. This is a manifestation of excessive heat from the small intestine attacking the gallbladder, where the offspring invade the mother, indicating a real pathogen. Upon inquiry, it was confirmed that the illness arose from unfulfilled plans. Administer four qian of ginseng and two qian of mutong, decocted into a broth with several doses of Longhui Pill, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>Another person presented with a hunched back and twisted legs, with a pulse that was deep, taut, and thin. The Shenwei Powder was given, leading to vomiting and diarrhea; after three doses, the patient recovered.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>A man aged fifty, with a dark complexion, has red swelling on his back and pain below his scapula. His pulse is floating, rapid, and tight. He also experiences vomiting after eating. It is mid-winter. A prescription of Ma Huang and Gui Zhi Decoction, along with wine, Huangbo, Shengfu, Gualouzi, Gan Caojie, Qianghuo, Qingpi, Ren Shen, Huangqin, Ban Xia, and Sheng Jiang is given, with six applications and gradual resolution of symptoms. This is a proper internal purging method, not the crucial Internal Purging Powder or medicines like Boswellia and Dolichos. It seems this formula is specifically for those who develop sores from ingesting dan stone; if not due to dan stones, it may not be an essential remedy.</p>
<p>A woman, aged sixty, has sores on her back. Her pulse is large and rapid, and she experiences chills and fever in the afternoon, with decreased appetite. She takes Lianqiao, Huangqi, and Sharen, three qian each; Ren Shen and Danggui, two qian each; Chenpi and Fuling, five fen each; Zhi Gan Cao and Baizhu, one qian each. With Huangqi as the chief ingredient and Gan Cao, Danggui, and Ren Shen as assistants, the formula is aimed at genuinely nourishing the internal void while simultaneously purging.</p>
<p>A seventy-year-old man suffers from back sores larger than a foot. He has received several applications of Wuxiang and Shixuan, mixed with pus and bloody filth, experiencing vomiting and inability to eat for over ten days. The patient took Internal Purging Powder on his own but felt discomfort in the chest, having suffered from a urinary condition for thirty years. Now he endures pain from the urination issue, and vomiting keeps him from sleeping. He urgently receives a decoction of Ren Shen, Huangqi, Danggui, and Baizhu, prepared in Niuxi soup, and mixed with bamboo juice for drinking. After three days of taking one and a half jin of the medicine, the urination pain stops, and appetite returns. After seven days, he has consumed four jin of the medicine, pus starts to flow out, and he finally gains peace at night. After another ten days, he maintains his stability.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>A man over sixty years old, who had a strong liking for wine and meat, developed an ulcer with pus and experienced vomiting and fever, likely due to the excessive consumption of inner tonics. The physician, addressing the vomiting, added cloves to the Jiahe powder to warm the stomach and promote the flow of qi. It was the hot month of July, and his pulse was strong and rapid. I noted that this pulse condition was particularly concerning in cases of ulceration; however, his vital energy was robust, so I recommended a mixture of ginseng paste and bamboo juice, consuming a total of fifteen pounds of medicine and over a hundred stalks of bamboo, which achieved stability. I said, “This illness is fortunately manageable. If he does not limit his diet, it will surely recur.” Still, he continued to eat richly. After a drunken episode in a water pool during summer, a year later, a soft lump the size of a cake appeared on his left side, which developed into an ulcer two years later. When I saw the pus and blood, his pulse was still strong and rapid, and he had vomiting with poor appetite. He decided to take the ginseng paste with bamboo juice again, consuming another hundred stalks, which brought him back to stability. Now at eighty years of age, he is as strong as before. This illness was due to the weakened blood and qi of old age; with just two doses of ginseng and bamboo juice, he recovered. If he had taken the inner tonics instead, I fear he would not have been as safe.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>I treated my older brother&#39;s back sore, which had developed into a severe condition, and we were too poor to afford anything but to await death. The wound appeared dark and deep, suggesting an internal issue. Urgently, I prepared a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, and rhizoma atractylodis for three days, and washed it with a mugwort and angelica decoction. He was in a frail state, almost unable to support himself, but fortunately, he did not have a fever and could still consume food. Each day, I gave him a large bowl of dumplings. After using five jin of the medicinal salve and providing thirty bowls of meaty dumplings, the wound gradually healed, likely due to the nourishing properties of the meat and dumplings.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In the winter of the year Wuy, I was stationed with the army in Chengwu County. There was a father of a merchant, over sixty years old, who developed a sore on his back just days after the winter solstice. Within five to seven days, the swelling reached about seven inches and was unbearable. The sore physician remarked that there was already pus and it could be lanced. The gentleman, fearing the procedure, did not comply. Three days later, the physician warned that not lancing it could lead to further complications. Eventually, he used a cauterizing needle to open the sore, allowing the pus to drain and relieving some pain. Because the opening was delayed, after two days, secondary symptoms arose, making him feel as if he was bearing a heavy stone, and he experienced intense heat and pain, with a rapid pulse. This was a transformation due to the accumulation of heat from rich foods. Given the strong heat of the evil energy, it was advisable to treat it with cooling remedies. The month was harsh and cold, and I had to be cautious about using cold treatments. I recalled the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which states that if there is a deficiency, one should counter it; while it may be contrary to the season, it could be appropriate to address the symptoms. Consulting with the sore physician, I swiftly prepared a cooling decoction, adding one tael and five qian of yellow lungwort for one dose. This resulted in bowel movements twice, and the pain decreased by seventy percent. The following day, I gave him the previous medicines again, and all symptoms were resolved. Over the course of the next month, he recuperated fully.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: When the history source mother felt a subtle itch between her back and hip, she looked and saw a red spot about half an inch wide, with white grains resembling millet. She immediately applied moxa treatment, and the redness subsided, stopping after twenty-seven applications. Later, she felt a slight pain again, and upon inspection, found a red area that flowed below, measuring two inches long and as wide as a chive leaf. The whole family regretted not treating it with moxa earlier. Some said that the nun Zhiqian from Dengci Temple had previously suffered from a very large sore, which was cured through moxibustion. When questioned, Zhiqian said that during the worst times, she was faint and unaware, but the junior disciples said that Fan Ba suggested a strict adherence to treatment, performing moxibustion over eight hundred times before she recovered, using about a sieve full of moxa. She quickly returned to report this.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>At first, I made a moxa cone as big as a ginkgo nut and applied ten or so moxas to it, feeling no pain at all. Then I cut it down to four sides, reducing the cone by three-quarters, and I felt the pain. After seven applications, it began to itch. With each successive burning, the red area shrank inwards. After about twenty applications, the red halo receded. The patient felt no fear and thus made larger moxa, gradually increasing it to the size of a chicken&#39;s yolk. It took about forty applications before pain was felt, and upon examining the charred area, it had already exceeded an inch in size. This was because the moxa was applied slowly, and by then the flesh at the initial site had already decayed; the dead flesh had become stubborn, causing pain only when healthy flesh was reached. The surrounding area felt pain because the flesh was not yet decayed. The patient had not slept for six nights, but now could eat porridge and sleep soundly. By evening, the sore appeared as if covered by a steaming basket, protruding three or four inches, with countless small openings and a deep black color. The sudden protrusion indicated that the toxic gas was escaping and gathering; the countless small openings suggested that the toxins had not yet fully concentrated and were still attacking the skin; the deep black color revealed that both the skin and the flesh were decayed. If the moxa fire had not expelled the toxins from the decayed flesh, the internal organs would have been pressured.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of the Xue Family&quot; states: Vice Monitor Chen Lushan worked diligently in his official duties, which harmed his vital energy. He developed a back pestilence with diffuse swelling; the central area was dark in color, with slight redness around the edges and mild pain. His pulse was floating and large, but thin when pressed. The left inch was short, while the right inch felt almost nonexistent. The swelling had not fully developed for over ten days. This ailment was due to deficient cold vital energy. In the morning, he was treated with ginseng, astragalus, ginger, cinnamon, angelica, atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, half summer, and honey-fried licorice to warm and supplement his yang. In the evening, he took a modified Eight Flavor Pill to nourish his liver and kidneys. After four doses, it festered; however, the pus was clear and watery, with night sweats and internal heat manifesting as evening fevers, along with a floating and rapid pulse. The treatment was switched to the Eight Treasures Decoction, which caused renewed fever and a rise in yang during the night—indicating kidney deficiency with rising fire. The modified Eight Flavor Pill was again prescribed, boiled and taken, leading to stability. </p>
<p>Additionally, through anger, liver fire was activated, leading to the sore bleeding about two cups; the left pulse was tense, while the right pulse was weak. This indicated that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen, preventing the liver from storing blood and the spleen from regulating blood flow. The Ten Complete Nutritional Pills, combined with the previous medicinals, were given in two doses, stopping the bleeding. Afterwards, the previous medications were used to regulate and achieve recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, Wang Qizhi had a back pestilence with sore heads resembling millet, heavy swelling, and a pulse that was deep and solid, indicating internal toxicity. He was given Huanglian Neishun Decoction in two doses, which slightly reduced the symptoms. He was then given the Immortal&#39;s Life-Preserving Decoction and recovered.</p>
<p>Scholar Liu Huafu experienced swelling and pain, with a floating and rapid pulse, indicating that toxins were accumulated in the meridians. He was treated with Neitui Fu Decoction in two doses, which diminished the swelling. The Immortal&#39;s Life-Preserving Decoction was given in four doses, leading to the resolution of pain and swelling, followed by additional diuretic medicine for complete recovery.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar suffered from a back boil, which was swollen and extremely painful, a result of excessive heat and poison accumulating.

<p>A man suffered from a back boil, where the necrotic tissue had festered but new tissue did not regenerate. This indicated a release of toxic energy and a deficiency in the spleen and stomach qi. He was treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Chuanxiong, Angelica, Wuweizi, and Astragalus, and gradually improved, eventually recovering fully with the Complete Nutritional Decoction.</p>
<p>Another man had a back boil with necrotic tissue and clear pus, yet no new flesh was forming. This indicated that the evil had been expelled but both qi and blood were deficient. He took the Complete Nutritional Decoction and improved greatly within a month.</p>
<p>A man had a painful back boil, swollen with redness extending over a foot wide, as if bearing a heavy stone. His condition was severe and required aggressive treatment, but his pulse was not suitable for such. Therefore, bloodletting was performed at the red area, yielding about a bowl of purple blood, and the swelling and pain suddenly receded. Further treatment with the Divine Power Powder and the magical restorative drink was applied in two doses, leading to bleeding and drainage from both the wound and the bloodletting site, which alleviated the issues. Generally, when the boils are severe, using aggressive medicines can deplete the vital energy in frail individuals, often causing a transformation of symptoms.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Zhou, residing in Lu, had long been repressed and developed a boil on his spine. His liver pulse was taut and strong, while his spleen pulse was superficial and large, and upon careful examination, weak. He was treated with the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction, adding Platycodon and Fritillaria, and a small amount of honeysuckle and angelica, which led to a sudden improvement in his liver pulse and a recovery of the spleen pulse. He then took the restorative drink twice, resulting in the pus draining and swelling reducing, though his liver pulse remained taut. Although the poison had been expelled, his stomach qi was still harmed, prompting the addition of Pinellia and Poria for recovery. The use of honeysuckle and angelica was not meant to treat the boils but to resolve the patient&#39;s doubts.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>The autumn official Gao Zhuo Zhen suffered from a painful carbuncle on his back, which was dark in color, hard, and as heavy as carrying a stone, causing a dreadfully clouded spirit. His relative, Court Evaluator Zheng Sha Cun, requested to accompany him for treatment. Zheng said: When Zhuo Zhen first served in a certain county in Huguang, due to the perilous condition of a certain river, he made efforts to improve it with notable success, and the locals built an ancestral shrine for him. Those who crossed the river would pray and offer sacrifices there. Since Zhuo Zhen fell ill, they suspected the shrine was to blame for the misfortune. I disagreed, stating that his illness was due to weakened vital energy from cold and accumulated toxic heat. Thus, I applied a garlic paste to the afflicted area, and applied moxa more than twenty times; he felt uncertain; then I laid out garlic and performed moxa again, still without realization; ultimately, I applied meat for moxa, and only after a long time did I understand, and he finally felt pain upon further moxibustion. I then administered a decoction of ginseng and prepared a greatly nourishing potion for him, and he began to recover.</p>
<p>For Officer Cao Wenzhao, who had suffered from a back carbuncle for over half a month, the ulcer was like millet and numerous, with internal pain like stabbing, and his pulse had ceased. This indicated a deficiency of vital energy with toxins accumulating inside, thus moxibustion was essential. I proceeded to burn moxa twenty to thirty times and gave him a decoction of Six Gentlemen with added patchouli and angelica for several doses. The condition of the ulcer began to improve, and the internal pain abruptly disappeared, with the stomach pulse gradually returning. However, the color of the ulcer remained purple and the necrotic flesh had not ulcerated, indicating a deficiency of yang energy. I then burned mulberry branches on the afflicted area to disperse the toxins and replenish the yang energy. Continuing with the previous medication, I added ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and cinnamon. The color became red and the pus thickened, with the necrotic tissue gradually decomposing. He was healed within two months. When the pathogenic qi is dormant and the true qi is weak, it cannot arise; hence, moxibustion along with significant tonics is necessary. If one uses ordinary medicines and waits for it to rupture naturally, very few escape regret.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The Confucian scholar, nearing sixty years of age, had a condition that began in mid-winter.

His hearing was impaired, his spirit was muddled, and he exhibited a weak and fine pulse, with the right hand suffering the most. He had been constipated for twenty-seven days, consuming over a hundred bowls of food without any noticeable change in his abdomen. Everyone wanted to relieve him, but I remarked: &quot;What pleases me is this.&quot; </p>
<p>I urgently administered a large dose of Six Gentlemen&#39;s decoction, adding ginger, aconite, and cinnamon. The sore began to ache. Afterwards, I used the initial medicine on an empty stomach, in the afternoon, I administered Six-Flavor Pill with added ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. I also applied two doses of Life-Saving Decoction, and a considerable amount of black blood was drawn out through acupuncture, with only a small amount of purulent discharge. His back immediately became lighter and softer, and his bowel movements normalized. </p>
<p>I had been away for four days, but when I returned, his spirit was again muddled, the sore had darkened and sunk further, with pus and water oozing. He could not eat, so I urgently provided equal measures of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, along with five qian of prepared aconite, and three qian each of ginger and cinnamon. After taking these, he asked for food and even two ducks. </p>

<p>Another man had a sore on his back that was swollen and mildly painful, with reduced appetite and fatigue. I said: This indicates a condition of systemic weakness, and the treatment should prioritize tonifying the original Qi. He did not believe and continued to use purgative toxins. The center of the sore was dark and about five inches wide, and all the symptoms were severe; he sought treatment again. I said: This is due to a weakness and coldness of stomach Qi, causing a change in symptoms. The urgent need is to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach, and then the severe symptoms will recede, allowing the dark flesh to regenerate. He still did not believe, so he excised the necrotic tissue to remove the severe symptoms, resulting in a failure to recover.</p>

I increased the aconite to three qian over two doses, but the diarrhea worsened. Then I prescribed one piece of aconite, with two qian each of ginger and cinnamon, and five qian each of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria for one dose. The abdomen finally began to warm, the vomiting ceased, the hands and feet started to warm, and the pulse gradually returned.

I said: &quot;The ulcer not healing indicates a failure of the spleen; dry tongue and cracked lips suggest depletion of the kidneys; frequent urination points to weak lung energy; internal heat and fever reflect an upward flaming of deficiency fire; thirst needing soup shows a sign of true cold; vomiting and diarrhea are signs of true fire failing; deafness and blindness indicate withered liver wood; dizziness when looking up indicates exhausted kidney energy.&quot; He refused treatment and later passed away.</p>

However, desiring rapid results, healing medications were then used, and the affected area suddenly felt heavy, with the body feeling like it was on fire, ultimately leading to his inability to recover. Dong Yuan stated: if the poison hasn&#39;t completely dissipated, healing medications cannot be used. Even if recovery occurs, it will surely reoccur. If the poison enters the abdomen, the chances of death are very high. In general, when the poison is eliminated and the spleen energy is strong, the flesh will naturally regenerate, and healing medications will not be necessary.</p>
<p>Zheng Dali suffered from abscesses in the bones, one on each side of his back. His back felt as heavy as carrying stones, and his arms felt like they were sinking. The sores were about the size of large beans, and there were countless smaller sores hidden under the skin. The color of the sores was dark and had not healed for seven days, accompanied by dry mouth and thirst. Upon examination, the spleen and stomach pulse was very weak. He mentioned that the porridge consumed the previous day had still not digested, resulting in acidity. I believed this was a difficult condition to treat, so I conferred with a skilled practitioner about the treatment method. We applied garlic moxibustion over twenty times on his back and arms, and he felt slightly better. We then used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with ginger juice, pan-fried gardenia, and evodia, taking it for several doses, which stopped the acidity, but his dry mouth and untreated sores persisted, remaining colorless and without pus. We applied moxibustion again over twenty times, and he suddenly improved, with the sores breaking out. At that time, as it was autumn, we also administered a tonic formula, using Shenmai Powder instead of tea.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>A man developed a back sore that didn&#39;t erupt, with a floating pulse that felt thin upon pressure. His blood and qi were both deficient, hence it couldn&#39;t erupt; thus, he required a strengthening medicine to recover.</p>
<p>In Zhu Yang Mountain, a governor, aged fifty-two, experienced a sore on his back near the heart, resembling millet, which grew larger over three days, with a root approximately five inches in diameter. It did not swell or hurt, nor was there fever or chills, and his pulse was weak and deep. I said: &quot;If it is real, it hurts; if it is empty, it itches. Without eruption or treatment, if it breaks down and does not close, it also needs no treatment.&quot; Therefore, I prescribed a strong supplement for yang qi, which was white and dull in color, yet the sore&#39;s condition remained the same, with fatigue, reduced appetite, and cloudy urination. I then prescribed several tonics for qi and blood, like ginger and cinnamon, yet the sore still did not erupt.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day, he became angry and suffered from vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously. I again administered a strong tonic, but the sore remained inactive. I retained the previous two prescriptions, as he was in a daze and couldn&#39;t take them. After being advised, he finally understood and took seven doses in succession. On the sixteenth day, the sore erupted, showing red and pale colors. On the nineteenth day, I gave him more than twenty doses of a strong tonic. Later, due to exertion, he sweated, felt dry in the mouth, and had a bloated sensation in the temples and the top of his head; this indicated deficiency in both blood and qi, with the liver and gallbladder fire inflamed upward. I used a formula to nourish the spleen and augment qi, adding gardenia and peony, and he quickly recovered. However, due to internal heat and restless sleep, his hands and feet often felt warm in the afternoons; I prescribed Xiaoyao Powder with added gardenia, which reduced the heat. I also administered Gui Pi Decoction, and the sore healed as well. In total, the sore emerged and closed within forty-two days without ever using any medications to attack the sore.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br><strong>Back Pain Case Study</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: Chen Mingqi, a provincial graduate from Jiangyin, lived in the capital and suffered from back abscesses. He was cured after taking a great tonifying remedy. The next day, he set up a banquet to express gratitude and spoke as usual. That evening, he received a letter from home that greatly upset him, causing anger and thirst; he ate a little pear. By night, he experienced multiple bouts of diarrhea. In the morning, he urged me to examine him, but his pulse had already faded, and he ultimately became unable to rise. Pears are diuretic; they promote the movement of fluids downward. Those with a weak, cold spleen and stomach or postpartum women should avoid them.</p>
<p>In the capital, Zheng Zhonghan suffered from back pain for half a month. He had over ten sores on his back, sized like chestnuts, swollen and hard, with roots as large as plates. His back felt heavy as if carrying stones. He underwent fifty cauterizations with garlic, after which his back felt lighter. However, feeling improved, he disregarded restrictions and after three days, it worsened significantly; the sores flared up again, causing pain. He took four doses of a life-saving remedy, with slight improvement; then, four doses of Xiangsha Liu Junzi Decoction, but his food intake decreased. He relied on his medical knowledge and took two doses of a toxin-clearing medicine, which further reduced his appetite, leading to excessive salivation, as if he were unaware; this was a sign of severe spleen deficiency. He used to take three qian each of Tori medicine, angelica, and astragalus but secretly removed most of them. Later, even after taking a strong tonic with ginger and cassia, it was still ineffective. Thus, he took one pound each of ginseng and astragalus, half a pound each of licorice and atractylodes, and one tael each of dried ginger, cassia, and prepared aconite to brew a paste in a jar, consuming it over three days. The salivation suddenly stopped, the corruption and sores healed, and his appetite returned. He used Tori medicine again for strengthening the spleen, and the necrotic tissue fell off, leading to full recovery.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>In the southern capital, a scholar named Ye Gong had a cousin with the surname Nie who suffered from a back issue. It was June, and the rotten flesh had already been removed, leaving a wound about an inch wide, red and inflamed. He had a fever, was unable to eat, and felt nauseous but couldn’t vomit. After taking ten Xuan San and other medications, he still couldn’t recover. Ye asked me to diagnose him.</p>
<p>Upon light examination of his pulse, it felt floating and rapid; upon deeper examination, it was weak and thin—signs of proper pulse after a rupture. However, the wound was open, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi; the nausea without vomiting indicated a weak spleen and stomach; the red and inflamed appearance showed signs of virtual fire. Nevertheless, he was still treatable.</p>
<p>I prescribed Shen Qi Da Bu Tang, adding wine-fried Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Wu Wei, Mai Men Dong, and a drink of children&#39;s urine. His appetite increased steadily, and muscles began to grow. After taking eight doses, the wound shrank to the size of a grain. However, influenced by others&#39; words, he took two doses of poison-reducing medicine, thinking it would eliminate residual toxins, but instead, his fever and delirium worsened; urgently, I administered the previous medicine again, and after more than twenty days, he finally recovered.</p>
<p>Later, he engaged in good deeds, staying awake for a whole day and night, which led to exhaustion and fever. He felt as if he was sleeping but was not; I then gave him two doses of the previous medication, which increased his fever and he could only drink hot soup. Ultimately, I added one qian of Fu Zi to the previous formula, and after two more doses, he recovered again.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>In the late autumn, Guan Zhenfu suffered from a back boil, which was dark and hard, causing no pain when touched. The pulse was deep and thin, and the limbs were cold. Urgently, he applied moxa with garlic, using over thirty sticks, but it did not hurt; he then used moxa about the size of millet in seven doses, applied directly to the flesh, and only then did he feel pain. He was given Six Gentlemen Decoction in two doses, with two qian of aconite in each dose, but there was no response; the next dose had an additional two qian of cinnamon, and then he began to respond.</p>
<p>Shi Wuxuan Lianbo was troubled by a back boil. He took internal medicine, a wind-dispersing formula, and applied cooling herbs externally. He sweated profusely without cessation, could not eat, did not sleep, and had a wound of a foot long that was dark and hard. Pressing it did not elicit pain, and his breath was faint; this indicated a loss of yang. The pulse was nearly nonexistent. He urgently applied garlic moxa for about one period, and the back felt lighter, with surrounding areas feeling no pain. There was an area of the back about six inches wide that had already died. He took a dose of fragrant sand Six Gentlemen Decoction, and the next day moxibustion was applied again. The dead blood in the painful area was released, prompting a need for needling. After my return, he was misled by another doctor and did not undergo needling; his blood coagulated again, leading to the application of a warming blood-activating medicine. The next day, guided by my advice, he underwent needling and expelled about two cups of black blood. They claimed that the pain in the back suddenly disappeared. Previously, he was given medicinals with ginger and cinnamon, which helped him sleep soundly. Upon awakening, his limbs felt slightly stronger, but he still lacked appetite, experienced sourness upon swallowing, and the wound was still painless. They believed this to be due to yin toxicity. I clarified that this was an extreme deficiency of qi and blood, with cold evil rampant within, and no yang nourishment present in the affected area, causing the flesh to die; it was not due to yin toxicity.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>Once yang energy returns, the stomach qi will revive, the dead flesh will decay, and one can be free from worries. With the previous two doses of medicine, each supplemented with two qian of ginger, cinnamon, and fuzi, and slightly taken with rice soup, the spirit returns to normal, the affected area remains hot, and the pulse is slightly stronger; thus, yang energy has partially returned. On this day, another physician claimed that the abscess was a fire condition, and given the current heat of summer, applied cool medicines like hibiscus root, and administered two bowls of porridge, along with detoxifying medication, leading to the decay of dead flesh. I believe hibiscus is a cold and cool medicine, which offers no benefit to the spleen and stomach. Should one eat immediately? The detoxifying medicine is an astringent and dispersive agent; how does it nourish yang energy? The dead flesh decays immediately? This is due to the previous effects of cinnamon and fuzi, which restored the stomach qi, thus allowing food intake, with strong yang energy leading to the decay of dead flesh. If a person with deficient cold does not have warming spices to revive yang and instead uses cold, cooling, toxic-clearing agents, can they possibly survive? If they think fire pertains to the yang condition and, sensing internal heat, apply warming and replenishing agents, would this not lead to death rather than revival? They do not realize this is a treatment method that disregards timing in favor of pathological condition.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>A man had a back abscess that began to suppurate; the swelling had not subsided for seventeen days, and his pulse was weak and quiet. I said: &quot;The pus and poison are not expelled, and the pulse is weak first; this is a sign of deficient vital energy. It should be replenished, otherwise, there will surely be complications later.&quot; He was confused by others&#39; words and took anti-toxic medicine. Although the necrotic flesh suppurated, the wound did not heal. Suddenly, he felt a pain in his abdomen, then passed white matter, and experienced urgency at the anus, prompting him to seek treatment again. I said: &quot;This is an internal deficiency. It is neither dysentery nor toxicity; it would be wise to warm and supplement the spleen and stomach.&quot; Consequently, all the ulcer doctors believed the poison was not yet resolved and continued administering the anti-toxic medicine until he died.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>He Shaocan had a sore on his back about the size of a bean, with no swelling around the root, and the flesh was of normal color. I said: This is a sign of severe deficiency and toxicity. Even if tonics are used, they will not be effective in consolidating it. First, I administered two doses of the Vitality Decoction, which slightly strengthened the back; after two more doses, the sore became slightly red. When I used a significant tonic, the sore produced black blood resembling wine, followed by fresh blood and a little clear pus. I said: It can be seen that the deficiency of Qi and blood is extremely severe. Other doctors believed it was a sign of excess Qi and blood, so they secretly administered a dose of detoxifying medicine, which resulted in vomiting, internal coldness, and ultimately death.</p>
<p>Zhou Yuyan, a minor official, had a sore on his back for four days. The sore&#39;s head was like millet, heavy as carrying a stone, hard and raised. He thought it was a minor ailment, applying cool medicines externally and taking a detoxifying powder internally. After four doses, he felt fatigued, had spontaneous sweating and night sweats, dry mouth, and insomnia, and requested me to treat him. I said: A sore should not be hard, nor should its color be dark. He replied: Initially, it was red and soft, but I used the previous two medicines, leading to this condition. I said: In cases of sores, they should feel like hemp externally and like melon internally; toxicity is accumulating inside, which is not a minor issue. The pulse was lightly diagnosed and seemed frequent; upon palpation, it was weak. Before it ruptured, the pulse weakened first, making it difficult to treat afterwards.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>Due to an inability to refuse the local customs, I endured more than twenty severe pangs before realizing the pain. After ten more pangs, my back began to feel somewhat relaxed. I took six gentlemen&#39;s decoction added with Astragalus, patchouli, angelica, Ephedra root, and floating wheat in two doses; my thirst stopped, and my sweating diminished, but the sores remained dark, hard, and unsightly. I then took warming, blood-moving medicines, and the sores began to appear; my thirst ceased, and sweating reduced, allowing the stagnant blood to disperse. After a long while, I began to sweat again, and my mouth became dry once more. After taking several doses, although the outer skin broke, the clear pus had not yet drained, and the internal pus seemed to seek another outlet; they applied medicine to surround it. I said: If the interior is deficient and the pus cannot break outwards, surrounding medicine forces the poison inward. By the twelfth day, the pulse was floating, and pressing it felt non-existent. I used the previous medicines twice more, adding ginger and cassia, which brought immediate comfort and sleep. After two more days, the pulse suddenly became weak. I administered the previous medicines again, adding seven parts of aconite, and gave two doses. The gentleman said: &quot;Now my back has begun to return to me.&quot; His body also felt strong, showing signs of life. However, since I mentioned earlier that it would be difficult to consolidate his condition, more treatment was required. I thus combined medications to clear heat and detoxify, along with cooling medicines, which ultimately led to internal deficiency and a decline in vital energy, resulting in a lingering condition resembling dysentery, treated with dysentery detoxifying medicines, and he died.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>Jiang, a juren, developed a back sore; ten days later it was in a critical state, rotten and causing thirst, preferring hot soup to drink. This indicated a deficiency of middle qi, unable to generate bodily fluids, leading to dryness of the mouth. It was advisable to supplement beforehand; otherwise, healing could not be achieved. Later, the sore did not heal. He suspected the poison had not yet been cleared and used two doses of detoxifying medicine, yet the sore did not heal completely. Facing abdominal pain, he took a cooling remedy and died.</p>
<p>Wang, having a back sore, was weak in primal qi. He started with medication to promote the interior but began to ulcerate after taking strong tonics. Misled by others, he applied cooling medicines, causing disharmony in the abdomen, urgent distress in the interior, and painful loose stools resembling dysentery. I stated: this is a case of internal deficiency, not dysentery. Yet he still used detoxifying medicine for dysentery and died. After a great ulceration, having white pus in the stool, whether it stopped or led to dysentery, indicates a deficiency of stomach and intestines; urgent distress and heaviness indicate blood deficiency. If it were truly dysentery, cooling detoxifying medicines should not be used. Furthermore, Master Zhongjing states: for dysentery that does not resolve, one must warm it; in cases of acute abdominal pain with dysentery, one should rescue the interior, possibly using warming tonics such as Li Zhong Wan with Fu Zi. For significant pain, one should warm. Master Dongyuan treated dysentery with sinking primal qi and did not neglect to use warming tonics. However, if the pus from the ulcer has been oozing for a long time and the qi and blood are weakened, whether to avoid warming tonics is beyond my knowledge.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>A man over forty years old had back sores without pus, felt very thirsty, his pulse was rapid and his body swollen, his complexion was purple and face red, and his urine was like paste.

He took a hundred pills daily on an empty stomach and before meals, washed down with child urine, and also took an Eight Treasures Decoction combined with Schisandra, Ophiopogon, Huangqi fried in wine, Zhimu, and red adzuki beans, simmered and consumed away from meals, and gradually used child urine instead of tea to drink. His thirst ceased, the sores healed. This is how I cured him.</p>
<p>In the capital, a man named Ji had back sores and weak stomach energy. I used warming and tonifying medicines and increased his food intake. After using strong tonics, the sores began to decay. Later, he had sores on his legs. I prescribed a blood-nourishing and phlegm-resolving remedy, which provided slight relief. He found it slow; others believed it was damp-heat. He took a dose of Ma Huang and Zuo Jing Decoction, sweating excessively. I warned him: “It will lead to spasms and death.” Eventually, it happened as I predicted.</p>
<p>A man with back sores in severe pain took detoxifying medicines and became even more inflamed. I treated him with garlic moxibustion to stop the pain and provided two doses of the Xianfang Huoming Decoction, which reduced the symptoms. I then prescribed an expelling medicine, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man had back sores for four days; the sore&#39;s top was like millet, and he experienced burning pain with a heavy back. His pulse was deep and solid.

<p>A woman had a back sore that was swollen, painful, and feverish, with a rapid pulse. After one dose of Qing Xin Decoction, she became stable.

<p>A man’s back sore was healing, but the muscle regeneration was slow. Diagnosis revealed deficiency in both spleen and stomach. He was treated with Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding Xiong, Gui, Wu Wei Zi, and Huang Qi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man’s back sore had healed, but one area presented protruding flesh resembling fungus, remaining untreated for three months due to wind and cold exposure. He was treated with pig fat mixed with Li Lu powder applied topically, leading to healing. There were also cases with three-inch protrusions where this treatment was particularly effective. Rubbing with Wu Mei also worked. If the condition was milder, sulfur could also be used.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>A man suffered from a back ailment with toxicity, experiencing aching pain, chills, fever, excessive sweating, constipation, and delirium. He took two pills of Po Guan Dan and found relief; later, he was treated with four doses of honeysuckle powder, which cleared the pus, and further healed with detoxifying medicine.</p>
<p>A woman had a back sore with formed pus, causing bloating and discomfort. After being needled, she took detoxifying medicine and was cured. Generally, in cases of back ailments, although there may be fever and pain, the condition appears serious yet manageable if thirst is present and the pulse is strong. If eating well, there should be no significant issues. Once the pus is released, all symptoms will recede. </p>
<p>Often, pain arises when pus cannot escape; using cold medicines to attack it could worsen the situation. If pus is present, it should be needled promptly; once it is released, the pain will cease. If heat and toxins cause pain before the pus forms, detoxifying medicine should be used. There may also be instances of decay extending over a foot; if there are no severe symptoms, tonics will promote healing without causing harm.</p>
<p>However, caution is necessary if the swelling is low, not red, not causing pain, the pulse is weak, there is no desire to eat, swelling has not burst, decay is not present, pus is clear and excessive but not stopping, and muscle growth is absent—this indicates deficiency of vital energy and is difficult to treat; robust tonics are advisable. In cases where pus and blood have already been expelled, the swelling and pain may intensify, with foul-smelling pus, restlessness, cough, severe abdominal pain and thirst, excessive diarrhea, and painful urination—these are signs of severe illness and should not be treated.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br>A weak woman has a sore on her back; although the outer skin is rotten, the inner pus has not burst forth, causing swelling and pain, along with restlessness and fever. I suggested that it should be urgently opened; once the pus comes out, the poison would be resolved, the pain would stop, and all symptoms would recede. However, she did not follow this advice, waiting for several days while the pus remained unyielding, and she became more painful and exhausted. Even though I applied acupuncture, it ultimately could not bring relief, leading to her condition becoming critical.</p>
<p>A man also has a sore on his back; it’s ulcerated, but the flesh is not rotting. I wanted to excise it and apply strong remedies.</p>
<p>A woman, who is generally weak, has a sore on her back that has not yet formed pus, with severe pain and fever. I believed she needed garlic moxibustion to draw out the poison and let it resolve on its own. Again, she did not follow this advice, and both her conditions became dire.</p>
<p>For cases I regularly treat, regardless of the lunar calendar, swelling and pain, whether mild or severe, but not ulcerated, I would apply moxibustion and observe the effects accordingly. For conditions that are not yet established, I first use wrapping medicine. Applying Wu Jin ointment or Yuan Sheng ointment at the affected area once or twice is quite effective. In cases of headache and tightness, indicating an external symptom, I first administer one to two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San. If pain and fever are present with a rapid pulse, I use Jin Yin Hua San or Huai Hua wine, or the effective Tuo Li San. For pain with swelling and a hard pulse, I utilize Qing Liang Yin, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin, or Ku Shen Wan. If there is hard swelling and fullness, with pain, fever, irritability, and cold drinks causing constipation with a deep solid pulse, I administer Nei Shu Huang Lian Tang or Qing Liang Yin. If bowel movements have been regulated and I wish for it to form pus, I use Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin, Tuo Li San, or La Fan Wan, along with the external application of Shen Yi Ointment.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br>If there is lack of appetite or unwillingness to eat due to a poor diet, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Huoxiang, taking three to five doses in succession. Additionally, apply the Xionghuang Jiedu Powder to cleanse the affected area. Daily, use Wujin Ointment to apply on the sore. When a sore develops, take a paper twist, dip it in Wujin Ointment, and insert it into the sore. If there is pus trapped beneath a fatty film that cannot be expelled, or if there is swelling and pain, it is advisable to draw it out with a needle; if there are necrotic tissues obstructing, remove them. If the necrotic tissue is loose and decaying, wash it with pig&#39;s trotter soup. If the pus is thick or painful, and the diet is normal or if necrotic tissue is decaying slowly, take a combination of disinfectants and medications to promote the discharge of pus, while continuing to apply the previous ointment. If the necrotic tissue has separated from healthy tissue, it should be removed promptly. If the pus is neither thick nor thin and there is slight pain, with no appetite and slow decay of necrotic tissue, further moxa with mulberry wood should be done, along with medications to promote pus discharge. If the necrotic tissue is not decomposing, or if the pus is thin and clear with little pain, urgently take a potent tonic and also use mulberry wood moxibustion to invigorate and dispel stagnant toxins. Observe that when the ulcers are slightly serious but not yet purulent, avoid the use of garlic moxibustion; if the pus is not mature and is left to decay on its own, it often leads to dire consequences. Generally, those with strong qi and blood or mild toxicity may rely on herbal efficacy or natural decomposition. However, weak individuals with heat toxins internally obstructed will not benefit from acupuncture, leading to incomplete results. Yet, if there is already pus formed, it must be opened urgently. Otherwise, in severe cases, it will lead to perforation of internal organs and decay of tendons and bones; in milder cases, it will prolong the decay of healthy flesh, making recovery difficult.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br>A woman had a back sore that did not erupt for over half a month; it did not produce pus, was very painful, and her pulse was weak. After applying moxibustion with garlic slices over twenty times, it stopped. She then took a resolving medicine, and the sore gradually softened, producing clear pus without the flesh decaying. With a combination of strong tonics and moxibustion from mulberry wood, the necrotic tissue was gradually dealt with, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>For those whose sores have not formed pus after one to five days and are painful, apply moxibustion until the pain subsides; if they are already painless, apply moxibustion until they ache. If there is no pain or just numbness, conduct moxibustion brightly to disperse any toxic energies. </p>
<p>If swelling is firm without pus, and there is slight pain or none at all, especially when the sore resembles millet, moxibustion is particularly effective. If after several days the color is only slightly red and there is no swelling or significant pain, it is advisable to apply more moxibustion without being restricted by the time frame, while also taking sweet and warming resolving medicines, and strictly avoiding cold and cooling substances. If there is stagnant blood that does not decay, apply moxibustion with mulberry wood as well. </p>
<p>If the pulse is rapid and hot with pain, it arises from yang, and can be treated. If the pulse is not rapid and has no pain, it arises from yin, and is difficult to treat. The absence of pain is particularly concerning and should not be viewed as an ordinary illness. This condition should not be entirely painless, nor should it be extremely painful. Those feeling troubled should not be treated. </p>
<p>In general, abscesses on the back, brain boils, severe swellings, detached sores, and foot problems are all caused by rich and heavy foods, excessive physical exertion, emotional disturbances, or the use of medicinals and essence-replenishing tonics, leading to deficiency of essence and weakness of qi. They do not arise solely from stagnation in the nourishing and protective systems. It is essential to apply moxibustion to draw out the poison, further identify the causes, and investigate the location of the pathogen within the organs to determine treatment based on deficiency and excess, ensuring there are no missteps.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>A man had a sore on his back, initially small like a grain, causing him distress, pain, thirst, and constipation; his pulse was rapid and strong, indicating that the poison resided in his organs. I believed it necessary to urgently drain it to eliminate the source, preventing the poison from invading further. He thought it was a minor issue and took ordinary medicine, but eventually, it deteriorated into a severe ulcer, leading to his demise.</p>
<p>An old woman suffered from sores on her back, initially three lumps, all small like grains, swollen, hard, and causing distress and agitation. By the sixth day, the lumps multiplied significantly; her pulse was large and, when pressed, felt deep and fine, with a blockage preventing treatment. Gradual treatment began, although both inside and outside were rotting, the pus could not be expelled due to the muscular barrier, leading to swelling and unbearable pain. I insisted that it needed to be opened, but she refused. Later, even though she tried to pierce it herself, the poison had already penetrated deep, and she also perished. Generally, the affliction of sores on the back, despite being called various names, fundamentally hinges on the dual principles of yin and yang. If one or two lumps arise, exhibiting swelling, redness, elevation, pain, and heat, they belong to the yang category and are easier to treat.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>If a lump initially appears like millet, not swollen or red, causing dull pain and irritability, great thirst and constipation, with mumbling or grinding of teeth, within four to five days the lump counts in numbers, its sores resemble a chestnut, taking on the shape of a lotus pod, hence it is called lotus pod hair; if it does not resolve over the days, pressing it releases blood, and by the eighth or ninth day or several days, the lump flattens, and everything contained within comes out, creating a unified clot, which, when removed, re-clots, forming a common sore that rots together, with purulent matter internally attacking, appearing dark purple, belonging to a type of abscess that is hard to treat. A pulse that is rapid and slippery is somewhat manageable, but a deep and thin pulse is particularly difficult. Such a severe condition can only be effectively treated with garlic moxibustion and the application of black ointment. For individuals with this condition presenting in the skin along the spine and thigh where a layer of muscle exists beneath, even if the outer skin breaks, the muscle is hard to rupture, causing internal pus to remain, leading to swelling and suffering, with qi and blood becoming weak, resulting in numerous changes in symptoms. If one waits for it to rupture on its own, it often leads to death. It must be opened up, along with draining the internal matter. Regular treatment of this condition, even with razor or scissors, often fails to remove it. This hard entity, waiting for it to self-rupture, could turn harmful. Those lacking strong blood and qi seldom see it rupture on its own.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>A man over fifty years old suffered from a sore on his back, which was swollen and painful, with a purple color and the skin about to break. He found it hard to eat or sleep, feeling extremely fatigued. He used mulberry branches to cauterize the affected area, releasing black blood, then fell asleep. Upon waking, all symptoms seemed to disappear. After taking two doses of a life-restoring potion and cauterizing once more, pus and blood all came out; with two more doses, the swelling and pain greatly subsided; finally, after taking several doses of a detoxifying powder, it healed. </p>
<p>However, the sore was very severe, and strong medicine was advisable to attack it, but being old, his blood and energy were weak, especially since it appeared on the surface of the skin. If one focuses solely on attacking the poison, the stomach&#39;s energy is first harmed, ultimately worsening the conditions.</p>
<p>A woman with a sore on her back experienced heat and pain, and solely took medicines to reduce heat and expel toxins. After the sore burst, the condition worsened, causing agitation, coughing, and painful urination, all of which were bad symptoms. She refused treatment and ultimately died. Generally, when dealing with sores and ulcers, among five good conditions, if one or two good signs appear, treatment may be successful; but among seven bad conditions, if one or two bad signs show up, treatment becomes difficult. If bad signs appear in a weak condition, it is hopeless; if in a strong condition there are no bad signs, recovery may occur by itself. Although this condition is said to be attributed to fire, it invariably arises from yin deficiency. Thus, it is stated in the classics: when the governing vessel is deficient, it emerges from the brain; when the bladder meridian is deficient, it emerges from the back. How can one be solely fixated on fire!<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br>Governor Zhao suffered from a back sore, which was swollen and hard, with no moisture, the sore resembling millet. His pulse was strong and rapid, and when pressed, it felt hard. The text states that if the marrow is not depleted and the organs are not failing, it can be treated. However, if the swelling is hard and the color is dark, as tough as a cow&#39;s skin, and the pulse is still more rapid, then this indicates that the vital energy has already been exhausted; without treatment, death is inevitable.</p>
<p>Zhang Yiren, over sixty years old, suffered from a back issue for three days. The color of the flesh did not change, with the sore about the size of millet, and with increasing weight on his shoulders and back, along with symptoms of chills and fever, and a rapid pulse. Chen Liangfu remarked that externally it felt like hemp, but internally like melon. The Qi family noted a dislike for cold and a strong heat, indicating a deep-seated issue. Additionally, with the flesh color unchanged, it was suggested to be an internal problem. I prescribed two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San and applied garlic moxibustion more than fifty times; the poison began to erupt, relieving some weight from the back. Then I used Tuo Li medicine to gradually promote ulceration. However, since his Qi and blood were extremely deficient, causing thirst, I used herbs like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and cooked rehmannia, which also alleviated the thirst. He wished for a quick effect, applying herbal poultices directly to the sore, which allowed the toxic energy to re-enter, leading to his demise.</p>
<p>I have often seen elderly and weak individuals affected by this; if the sore does not rise or is as hard as a cow&#39;s skin, many do not survive before it ulcerates. Even those who do ulcerate but cannot nourish their Qi and blood would also die. Generally, when a sore first ulcers and the poison is strong, it is advisable to use a plaster to draw it out, followed by herbs like ginseng and astragalus to support healing. If one instead uses medicine to suppress it, causing the toxic energy to attack from within, recovery is surely impossible.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br>Deputy Minister Yu Yi had small sores on his back but was unaware of them. He only applied medicine to nourish the area, and for several days, there was no pain or itch, nor did it spread, which made him suspicious. He called for an external doctor who performed moxibustion two hundred times, but it was already too late. This individual had never taken medicine throughout his life; for a year, he only felt occasional heat in his palms and soles, and since he neglected early treatment of his illness and mistakenly took nourishing medicine, how could it last long? It is said that there is no remedy for ailments on the back. A proverb states: &quot;There are no good sores on the back; only those situated directly in the center can be deemed true sores of the back.&quot; Although it is stated that there are no remedies for back ailments, this is not a universal principle. However, someone who blindly seeks to nourish without understanding the changes in their condition is also in a situation that cannot be ignored.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br>Cheng Mingyou treated a woman named Hu Yu, who was sixty years old and suffering from a large ulcer on her back, swollen like a bowl, with a head resembling a beehive. She experienced vomiting and difficulty swallowing. The ulcer had been treated with medicines, but though the poison was expelled, it caused a coldness in her stomach and diarrhea. Cheng said, &quot;For every illness, one must differentiate between yin and yang, as well as deficiency and excess. Now the stomach is harmed by cold, hence the vomiting and reversal. By warming and nourishing, we can restore the vital energies and blood circulation, and the poison will be expelled along with the pus, allowing the flesh to gradually regenerate.&quot; After following his prescription for four or five doses, she was able to swallow, the vomiting ceased, the ulcer ruptured, and her condition gradually improved.</p>
<p>Chen Dougan treated Wang Zhuzheng, a man from Fujian, who suffered from an ulcer on his back with severe pain and a cough that persisted for over ten days without food or drink. His pulse was nearly imperceptible. The doctors could not treat him. Chen observed and said, &quot;This is due to excessive cold, causing a collapse of the vital energy.&quot; He prescribed a formula of the Four Gentlemen herbs, adding ginger and cinnamon to progress the treatment. Gradually, his condition improved, and the ulcer started to heal.</p>
<p>Zhou Pingzhi examined a patient with an ulcer on the back, which had not healed for a long time. He summoned the ulcer specialist Xu Tingli for treatment, who consistently administered medications without effect. Xu then said to Zhou, &quot;Please ask Sheng to join us in the treatment, for my skills have reached their limit.&quot; When Sheng arrived, they applied a similar treatment regimen but increased the dosage of ginseng by five qian and made slight modifications with aconite. After taking the medicine, both of his legs became warm, moving from the lower to the upper body. He told his son, &quot;What a miraculous medicine this is! I feel instantly rejuvenated.&quot; Within ten days, the wound had completely healed.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>Wang Shishan treated an elderly man suffering from a carbuncle. Upon examination, his pulse was flooding, slow, and soft; the carbuncle was as swollen as a bowl, with little change in the skin and flesh, not very painful to the touch, and he had slight chills and fevers. Wang said, &quot;If the swelling were located at a place where the muscles and bones are thin and tightly intertwined, it would be difficult to treat. Now that the swelling is below the shoulder bone, it is at a point of the Sun Meridian, and it is still possible to treat it.&quot; He then prescribed five qian of astragalus, one qian each of angelica, notopterygium, and licorice, and advised to keep the patient warm under a cover. The medicine was to be taken hot, inducing slight sweating. After sleeping soundly, the swelling subsided after one night, and after five doses, the patient was stable.</p>
<p>Zhang Dehong, a jinshi, had a slight swelling and redness on his back, with diminished appetite and thought. I used the Six Gentlemen formula, leading to pus formation and rupture; then I used nourishing yang energy herbs, resulting in flesh growth and retraction. Suddenly, he experienced chills and fever, and the affected area swelled again, his pulse was floating and large, almost imperceptible upon pressure, and he felt greatly fatigued. I said to him, &quot;This is due to a deficiency in stomach qi, not a toxin from the sore.&quot; He replied, &quot;In the early morning, when I used the toilet, I encountered foulness, which must affirm your claim about my weak stomach!&quot; I used tonifying methods to aid retraction.</p>
<p>Wang Zidai from the county had suffered from a carbuncle on his back for over a year. The sore had barely closed at the opening, the color was dark and depressed, his complexion was sallow and weak, and his pulse was floating, weak, and thin. This indicated a deficiency in the spleen and lung qi. I prescribed the Complete Restoration Decoction with a small addition of fuzi (Aconite), and after several doses, his vitality gradually revived; I then removed the fuzi, and after over thirty doses, he fully recovered and was recommended by the township.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>A woman, over fifty years old, in early April, developed a sore on her back, the size of a grain. After three days, it grew larger, with a root about five inches long. It was neither swollen nor painful, and she didn’t have chills or fever. I took her pulse, which was weak and deep. I said: when the pulse indicates illness but the body does not show symptoms, it is concerning. In a case of excess, there is pain; in deficiency, there is itching. This is what distinguishes yin and yang presentations. If it does not erupt, it will not be treated. If it erupts but does not heal, it will also not be treated. I then gave her a remedy to greatly replenish yang energy, which appeared pale and dull; the sore remained the same. By the twelfth day, upon checking her pulse again, it was still deep, the sore had not progressed, she felt fatigued, had a reduced appetite, and her urination was scanty. I then prescribed a remedy to greatly replenish qi and blood, adding ginger and cinnamon, yet the sore also did not progress. On the fifteenth day, due to anger, she experienced vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, so I had her take a dose of the restorative medicine, but the sore still did not improve. I left two more doses of medicine and left. The patient was in a daze and did not take the medicine. Some encouraged her, and she finally understood. Following the prescribed method, she took seven doses in succession. On the sixteenth day, the sore began to erupt and became red and light in color, with pus similarly appearing. On the nineteenth day, I arrived and was pleased to see: the sore had crossed the critical phase, but her vital energy was still waning, which remained concerning, so I continued with the great restorative medicine for over twenty doses. On May 11th, due to overexertion, the patient developed spontaneous sweating, a dry mouth, a stiff tongue, and swelling at both the temples and the crown. I was called upon again. Upon examination, I concluded: both qi and blood are deficient, and there is inflamed fire in the liver and gallbladder. I used a tonic formula to invigorate qi, adding gardenia and peony, and she promptly improved. However, she experienced internal heat, had difficulty sleeping, and her hands and feet felt warm intermittently, accompanied by chills and fever. I prescribed Xiao Yao San with additional gardenia, and the heat subsided. I then used Gui Pi Tang, and the sore finally healed. In total, the sore lasted forty-two days from onset to healing.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>A man had a back sore that did not heal and was experiencing hesitation in urination, with red turbid urine, swelling and heat, dry mouth, and fatigue. His pulse was rapid and forceful but weak. I prescribed ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, cooked rehmannia, notopterygium, peony, aged tangerine peel, ophiopogon, five-flavor berry, honey-fried licorice, and cinnamon to tonify the original qi and draw the vacuous fire back to the channels. However, the pulse and symptoms worsened; the medicine was insufficient. After another dose, the symptoms suddenly improved, but I removed the cinnamon and after several more doses, he recovered. This condition was due to a prior deficiency in tonifying the original qi.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br>Zheng Chao, a scholar of Zhonghan, suffered from a back ulcer accompanied by fever, phlegm, loss of appetite, muscle atrophy, and fresh bleeding from the sores. I said: &quot;This is due to deficiency in the spleen&#39;s energy, which cannot control the blood and return it to its source. The treatment should focus on tonifying the spleen and stomach.&quot; He did not believe this and opted for methods to detoxify and cool the blood. However, he soon experienced severe chills and vomiting, which led him to realize the truth of my words. He used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added roasted ginger, Pinellia, and Poria for several doses, and all symptoms subsided. I then recommended the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction, and the wounds gradually healed. Later, due to increased food intake, he experienced diarrhea that turned into dysentery, which indicated a deficiency and cold in the spleen and stomach. Therefore, I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with the Four Divine Pills to stop the dysentery. Subsequently, he took the Six Gentlemen Decoction again, and his wounds healed completely.</p>
<p>Yuan Huaixue, a nobleman, had a back ulcer, experienced fever and thirst, with a rapid but weak pulse. He took the Four Substances Decoction with added Coptis, Anemarrhena, Scrophularia, Gardenia, Forsythia, Schisandra, Ophiopogon, and Lonicera, and his pulse and symptoms gradually improved. I then added Angelica, Ginseng, and Astragalus, leading to the complete decomposition of rotten flesh. After stopping the medicine and due to overexertion, he continued to feel feverish and thirsty, so I prescribed Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica, Angelica, roasted licorice, Chinese yam, Chinese sour jujube, Poria, Alisma, and cinnamon, which stabilized his condition. Additionally, I used the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill and the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction to consolidate his recovery.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>Zhou Honggang, the prefect of the capital, had a back ulcer that did not suppurate, with a large and floating pulse, indicating a deficiency of yang qi and stagnation of evil qi. He was treated with Tori Powder, doubling the use of Ginseng and Astragalus. However, internal heat caused thirst, with a surging pulse; this was attributed to false fire. The treatment was adjusted to urgently add Cinnamon to the previous formula, resulting in a quick decline of symptoms; he continued with Tori Powder until recovery. To use cold medicine for heat toxins in such a case would be a mistake.</p>
<p>Wang Dedang from the Ministry of Justice initially had a back sore, exacerbated by overexertion and the use of medicinal formulas like Shixuan Powder, leading to internal heat with symptoms of panting and thirst, and a large, weak pulse. This indicated that his yang qi was injured and thus could not rise, sinking into the yin portion and causing internal heat. I treated him with a combination of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding wine-fried Peony and Mai Dong, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Zhang Kegong from the Upper Residence had a back ulcer. Both internal and external treatments were cold and dispelling toxins, resulting in widespread pain, desire to vomit, reduced appetite, evening heat, and fear of cold. I observed that the widespread pain indicated weak protective qi that could not nourish the flesh; the desire to vomit and reduced appetite illustrated a weak cold spleen and stomach that could not digest; internal heat and evening heat indicated a deficiency of yin blood, with yang qi sinking into the yin portion; fear of cold and aversion to chill showed the weakness of yang qi that could not protect the skin. All these issues stemmed from insufficient qi in the spleen and stomach. Thus, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and the symptoms gradually improved. I also utilized Shi Quan Da Bu Tang as the necrotic tissue began to break down and later used Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Chuanxiong and Angelica, resulting in rapid regrowth of muscle and eventual recovery.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br>The Confucian scholar Zhou Liangfeng had long been troubled by internal accumulation, suffering from a sore on his back, with a taut and strong liver pulse, and a floating and large spleen pulse. Upon gentle examination, it was tender. I prescribed the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Platycodon and Fritillaria, and using a small amount of Honeysuckle and White Mulberry in two doses. The liver pulse improved significantly, and the spleen pulse became stronger. Then, I administered two doses of the Huó Mìng Decoction, leading to the pus exhausting and the swelling subsiding, but the liver pulse remained taut. Though the poison had been expelled, the stomach energy was still harmed, so I continued with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Poria and Pinellia, and he recovered.</p>
<p>As for Cai Dong, who suffered from a sore on his back, I used the Tuo Li medicine and it softened, but the sore had not fully closed. At that time, it was mid-winter, and he also had a cough. I said: &quot;The sore has not closed, indicating a deficiency in spleen energy; the cough persists, indicating a deficiency in lung energy. We must tonify the source.&quot; One day, while dining together, I noticed he avoided lamb. I stated: &quot;Tonifying can alleviate weakness, items like ginseng and lamb are best for nutrition. You ought to eat them.&quot; Thus, he did not refrain from it daily, and after more than ten days, the sore healed, and the cough also significantly improved.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>Deputy Minister Xian suffered from back sores in early spring, with dark color and swollen thirst, his pulse was rapid and strong. This indicated that the kidney&#39;s water was depleted and he was nearing death from an excess of fire. To disbelieve this, further bitter and cold medications were used, which only harmed the vital energy and hastened his demise.</p>
<p>In mid-summer, a man named Chai Fu from Jingzhao had similar back sores, displaying a dark color and slight swelling, with heat and agitation, excessive phlegm, and a full lower abdomen, his hands and feet were cold. The right pulse was floating and weak, while the two wrist pulses were thin. I said this was a sign of deficiency and cold. The Grand Official Wang said that great heat without heat meant there was no fire, and thus it could not arise. He earnestly requested treatment, so I administered a warm, tonifying medicine. Although the drooling stopped, the sore did not improve, and he ultimately could not be saved.</p>
<p>Old doctor Gu from Baoquan, aged sixty-five, developed a sore on his back the size of a basin due to extreme anger, with black discoloration around it. He called a sore doctor for treatment, who applied cold medicine, and upon application, it felt cool. The doctor stated that after seven or eight days, he would use a knife to remove the stagnant flesh. But upon waiting, he observed that the surrounding black color was blood stagnation and applied more cold medicine, which was not the correct treatment. He then removed the old medicine and treated with hot medicine, which caused intense itching throughout the night. The next day, the color was bright red and the swelling subsided; however, dozens of small holes appeared like a honeycomb. One day, he then felt nauseous and saw one person&#39;s head as if it were two. Diagnosing himself, he said this was a sign of extreme deficiency. I gave him a large dose of ginseng and附 with two servings, and upon examination, it had already improved. Within a few days, he completely recovered.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br>A woman, having given birth late, took a magical elixir for gathering treasures and developed a boil on her back, which became very critical. Her pulse was weak and large, so she urgently administered over a hundred doses of a modified Si Wu Decoction to nourish her yin blood. Fortunately, her constitution was robust, making it easier to consolidate her condition.</p>
<p>In the household of Wu Xiang Shi Bangzhi, during midsummer, a patient suffered from a boil on his back, with necrotic tissue that would not discharge. He had high fever and severe pain, felt nauseous with little appetite, and had a dry mouth needing to drink soup. His pulse was strong and large, yet when pressed, it felt weak and thin. This indicated true cold internally with false heat externally. Accordingly, it was essential to follow the evidence: first, he was treated with four doses of Liu Jun Zi Decoction enhanced with roasted ginger and cinnamon. His appetite improved, and all symptoms rapidly receded. Then, he was given the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, adding ginger and cinnamon for over fifty doses, leading to the discharge of the necrotic tissue. After another fifty doses, new flesh began to grow. This individual&#39;s qi and blood were abundant, allowing for easy onset and resolution of ulcers. If the physician had been aware of this, he would have provided preventive care, avoiding this affliction altogether.</p>
<p>A man, having carelessly exerted himself in intimate relations, developed swelling on his back and shoulders that rose about three inches and stretched over a foot wide, with spontaneous and night sweats, a sensation of internal heat and fever, and a dry mouth needing soup. His pulse was floating and large but weak and thin when pressed. This stemmed from a deficiency of essence and weakness of qi. He was treated with ten doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, adding five-flavor herbs, Mai Dong, Shan Yu, and Shan Yao, which resolved all symptoms. Given that he had other issues, a separate prescription of Liu Qi Decoction was also provided; the deficiency symptoms had completely manifested, and the swelling was as hard as stone. I then used the previous formula in six doses, achieving a complete recovery.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>In the early summer, Yang Gao from Neihan suffered from a back abscess. After taking the detoxifying medication for over two weeks, the area remained swollen and hard, heavy as if burdened by a stone. He had undergone over fifty cauterizations with garlic, but his back became lighter. Administering six gentlemen&#39;s herbs along with sand ginger in two doses caused a flood of saliva, and his food intake reduced. This indicated a deficiency in the spleen and a loss of yang qi. The warming and tonifying medicine led to nausea and a lack of appetite; thus, I reverted to the previous prescription in larger doses, adding aconite, ginger, and cinnamon, but there was no response. I then prescribed one pound each of ginseng and astragalus, half a pound each of white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel, and one tael of aconite, to be decocted and taken for three days. This halted the drooling, caused the necrotic tissue to break down, and allowed him to resume eating. I then used ginger and cinnamon and other herbs to strengthen the spleen, resulting in the necrotic tissue shedding and the ulcer healing.</p>
<p>Wang Dezhi suffered from back pain, his pulse was superficial and rapid; pressing down revealed a thin pulse. He had not had a bowel movement for five to six days, and his abdomen was not distended. I said: The pathogens are on the surface, not internally, but due to a deficiency in qi and blood, and reduced food intake, the bowels are not moving; it is not due to heat accumulation, and we should focus on nourishing qi and blood. However, there was accumulated internal toxicity, and I used rhubarb to purge it, resulting in three or four loose stools and increased fever. The next day, after taking another dose, he continued to have diarrhea, food was not digesting, he suffered from continuous hiccups, and his hands and feet became cold. Upon diagnosing him, his pulse was faint, and I advised against further treatment. His son asked: Could purging be harmful? I replied: If one takes a purgative and diarrhea does not stop, it can be fatal. If one purges when it&#39;s inappropriate and causes endless bowel movements, it can be fatal. If too much fluid is lost, it can be fatal.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br>It is said: Sores and ulcers are a result of accumulated toxins within the organs. If one does not expel these toxins, how can one find relief? I said: Although the toxins accumulate in the organs in cases of sores and ulcers, the treatment should first assist the stomach’s energy to strengthen the foundation, combined with medicines to invigorate blood circulation at the appropriate times, rather than relying solely on harsh purgatives like Da Huang. Now, if there is an exterior condition yet one were to use extreme purging agents, taking away the yin, how could this be acceptable? Therefore, it is said: In cases of exterior diseases, if one forces a downward action while the interior is harmonized, the vital energy becomes deficient, allowing external pathogens to exploit this weakness, leading to countless variations in malady. Though the pulse may be floating and rapid, indicating that the pathogen is on the surface and external in nature, one should use internal tonics and reconciling decoctions, and even Huang Qin and Cang Zhu should not be used liberally. If the pulse is deep and solid, indicating that the pathogen is internal and attributed to internal causes, one should use Huang Lian Decoction to disperse it internally, and even Da Huang and Bing Lang should be avoided. Moreover, considering the floating and rapid pulses—indicating deficiency of both blood and vital energy—if the pathogen remains at the surface yet one resorts to harsh purgatives to severely deplete the interior, the punishment will be excessive, leading to death, if not immediately.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a><br>Zhang Jinyi, over forty years old, suffered from back pain, and his heart pulse was rapid and forceful, indicating a dangerous condition. A rapid and forceful heart pulse signifies excessive heart fire. The classics state: all pains, itchiness, sores, and ulcers relate to heart fire. The heart governs blood; if the heart energy is stagnant, blood does not circulate, leading to abscesses. To relieve the heart fire, one should apply moxibustion at the acupuncture points related to the heart; urgent moxibustion should be done to drain the heart fire, and garlic can be used in moxibustion to draw out its toxins, then combined with detoxifying agents to achieve complete recovery.</p>
<p>The Ping family&#39;s servant experienced back pain and, after taking over twenty doses of detoxifying medicine, the condition worsened. In a fit of anger, she suddenly vomited five or six bowls of blood, becoming weak with a frail pulse, indicating extreme deficiency of energy and blood. Therefore, I prescribed about a pound of ginseng paste, which slightly eased the condition, followed by over thirty doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, aged tangerine peel, and roasted licorice, leading to a gradual closure of the wound. If one were to administer rhinoceros horn and rehmannia decoction to cool the body, it is rare for it to be ineffective.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br>Gu Haoshi was over forty years old and suffered from a back ailment, which he treated with a medicinal powder that led to an abscess. Suddenly he began to vomit and experienced pain from the sore; his stomach pulse was tight and wiry, which he believed to be internal toxicity attacking him. Dongyuan stated that vomiting at any time, along with cold hands and feet, indicates a deficiency in the internal organs. Danshi noted that if vomiting occurs after a sore has burst, it signifies internal dampness. Additionally, if pus is discharged but pain returns, this indicates deficiency. His tight and wiry stomach pulse, with wood overpowering earth, clearly indicated deficiency.</p>
<p>I intended to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction, with wine-fried peony root, cardamom, and patchouli to treat him. However, he took Hu Xin San on his own, which worsened the vomiting. When he sought treatment again, I continued with the previous prescription but added tonifying herbs for qi and blood. After two months, he recovered.</p>
<p>In general, if dampness invades internally or if there is a response to contaminated air that causes vomiting, the patient will prefer warmth and have a weak pulse. If heat and toxicity attack and cause vomiting, they will prefer coolness and have a rapid pulse; hence, clear differentiation is necessary. There may also be issues like unsatisfactory bowel movements, abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, or acid reflux, which indicate a deficiency of cold in the intestines and stomach, requiring treatment with Li Zhong Tang. If the condition does not improve, adding two to three slices of processed aconite may help. </p>
<p>If diarrhea occurs in the early morning, it is termed kidney diarrhea and can be treated with Er Shen Wan. If there is a gradual loss of appetite leading to weight loss, it indicates a deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, and it is particularly important to take Er Shen Wan, as it is also a crucial remedy for nocturnal emissions and to build muscle. </p>
<p>I once treated a patient who had little appetite, was preoccupied with thoughts of food, and experienced acid reflux and belching, but none of the medications were effective except for Li Zhong Tang and Fuzi Li Zhong Wan. This condition arises due to deficient and cold middle energy that cannot transform stagnation, hence using warming and tonifying methods will harmonize the middle qi, eliminating such symptoms.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br>A man, after feeling thirsty, developed a carbuncle on his back that had not yet burst, with a pulse that was rapid and weak.

Subsequently, he used the pill form and recovered.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a><br>Liu Taizai&#39;s wife, Lady Ziyan, suffered from back pain due to insufficient vital energy and was treated with tuoli medicine, which helped her recover. Wang Anren, whose back was already deteriorating, sought quick results by applying herbal medicine, but died the same day.</p>
<p>Liu Dayin, nearly fifty years old and traveling to the capital while mourning the loss of his son, had a back ailment measuring about six inches. It was not painful, but he experienced fever, dry mouth, chills with spontaneous sweating, reduced appetite, uncontrollable bowel movements, shortness of breath, and a floating, weak pulse. I prescribed four doses of the Shendanqi medicine, adding banxia and fuling, along with moxibustion using garlic. He reported that the heaviness in his back had subsided, though he felt weak, still suffering from sour belching, and he sensed that the food he had eaten the day before was still in his stomach. I then added ginger and cinnamon to the previous medicine and prescribed two more doses. His appetite gradually improved, the sour belching ceased, and he began to sleep, with the wound neither paining nor breaking open, leading me to suspect it was a yin condition. I said: this is due to deficiency of yang, which cannot nourish the affected area; thus, the necrotic tissue neither pains nor ulcerates. If the stomach’s qi recovers and he begins to eat, the dead tissue will certainly ulcerate. I continued the previous medication for six doses, his appetite gradually increased, the affected area began to ulcerate, and the pulse grew stronger. I stated: this indicates the recovery of yang.</p>
<p>Later, misled by other physicians, he insisted on taking Feilong Duoming pill, believing sweating was beneficial. He took a dose that led to excessive sweating, which continued for three days without cessation, prompting him to seek further treatment. I told him: excessive sweating depletes yang, leaving us unable to help. He insisted, claiming: various texts say that if there is sweating, the wound is healed; how can it be a problem? In the end, he indeed died.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br>Mr. Dongyuan says: The sores and ulcers arise from wind and heat stagnating in the lower part of the body. Such individuals are often prone to anger, and their sores are red, swollen, elevated, hard, and painful. The pulse is weak and slow, with a tense quality in the left guan position. This indicates that the evil energy has invaded the blood vessels and resides between the skin layers. Therefore, inducing sweating to circulate the defensive and nutritive Qi will eliminate the pathogenic energy.</p>
<p>Xu Fuqing from Yixing, over forty years old, suffered from a back sore for five days without improvement. The color of the flesh did not change, the pulse was weak, he had little appetite, and his stools were loose. I found that generally, if the sore had not yet burst, the pulse would be weak first, making it hard to gather and contain the condition. I prescribed two doses of the Tuoli Xiaodu San to help initiate the process. However, he heeded an old woman’s advice to apply a medicated plaster and take a toxic-clearing medicine, which made the condition worse; his back felt as heavy as carrying a stone, prompting him to seek my treatment again. </p>
<p>I then performed moxibustion with garlic for more than thirty sessions. He reported that while his back felt heavy, it was merely itchy and painful without any other sensations. I continued using the Tuoli medicine to alleviate the pain and itchiness. The pus became clearer, and I increased the original formula with more ginseng and astragalus, along with ginger and cinnamon, causing the pus to thicken slightly. </p>
<p>Yet, he was misled again by others, applying pig kidneys to draw out the pus and blood, while internally taking a salt and sulfur mixture, which resulted in a blood loss of about five to six bowls and continuous diarrhea for over ten instances. His abdomen felt like ice, and he could not eat or drink. Reluctantly, I hurried to examine him. His pulse had become faint and weak; he was beyond medical help. His symptoms indicated extreme deficiency and insufficiency; although warm tonics could still be considered, I feared they would be ineffective. How could it be that using aggressive remedies would not lead to death!<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br>Kuang, a successful candidate in the imperial examination, was suffering from a carbuncle that was beginning to heal, but he had severe constipation. He took rhubarb and other medicines, which caused him to lose his appetite. I used a remedy to replenish his qi and blood, adding peach kernels and sesame seeds, but it was ineffective. I then administered pig bile deeply into the gastrointestinal tract, and continued with tonics for his blood and qi, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>Governor Wang&#39;s wife was suffering from a carbuncle on her back that was festering and not breaking open, causing her to feel lethargic and unable to eat. This indicated that poison had entered her body, which could not be treated easily. I forced the issue, using a needle to open up the abscess slightly, and she showed some signs of improvement, but soon after, she passed away. Generally speaking, when a person&#39;s blood and qi are robust, pus will flow out naturally; however, in the elderly and weak, the qi and blood become depleted, making it necessary to confront and expel the pus, to follow the natural order in treatment. If the poison becomes lodged in the limbs, requiring more gentle needling, or if it has festered deeply and extensively, it will be difficult to contain. When there is painful swelling in critical areas such as the cheeks, neck, or abdomen, it is urgent to employ acupuncture, regardless of whether the patient is strong or weak; otherwise, treatment will be challenging.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br>Madam Wang suffered from a back boil, applied medicine, which coldly affected her chest, causing nausea. She urgently ordered the medicine to be washed off and was cured with a warming remedy.</p>
<p>Assistant Zhang had a back boil and used only external medicine; the sore did not appear dark, but there was chest distension, making breathing difficult. Believing he could not be cured, he was treated with a warming remedy and recovered.</p>
<p>Wang Tongfu had a back boil for over ten days with a serious condition and a strong pulse. Initially, two doses of sophora flower wine were given to reduce the severity; then, two doses of detoxifying medicine, followed by several doses of a warming remedy, gradually led to the boil breaking. He applied moxa on the affected area for a long time daily and continued with ointment; after moxibustion several times, pus burst out and decayed. A warming remedy with white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel was used, and after over a month, he recovered.</p>
<p>Deng Dayin had a back boil. After six or seven days, his back was swollen and painful, the condition serious. He received moxa treatments with garlic paste for a hundred times, drank two bowls of sophora flower wine, and then slept; subsequently, he took a detoxifying remedy, and after ten doses, he felt relieved. He was advised to apply moxa to the affected area, leading to his recovery in a few days.</p>
<p>Eunuch Liu Guan suffered from a back boil, and I was ordered to treat him. The swelling was painful and purple, with a pulse that was deep and rapid. Chen Liangfu said: a rapid pulse with heat and pain indicates an external yang condition. Moreover, if the sore is very red and purple, it signifies extreme heat resembling water. Inquiry revealed he had taken Bone-Penetrating Pill for half a year, resulting in accumulated heat. Therefore, a cleansing Huanglian Decoction was given, followed by more balanced medicine. He was then treated with pus-dispersing detoxifying powder, pig’s hoof soup, and Taiyi ointment, achieving recovery. As the classics say, color and pulse should correspond. The practitioner should understand the principles of excess and deficiency, and the mechanisms of yin and yang transformations.<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a><br>A scholar developed a swelling on his back, which was soft when pressed, with the normal flesh color. His diet remained unaffected, but he felt fatigued and coughed up phlegm when laboring. This indicated a deficiency of the spleen and stagnation of phlegm. I treated him with a tonifying formula to replenish the center and benefit qi, adding Poria and Pinellia, with a little Qianghuo, and applied a medicine called Yin-Yang Powder externally, mixed with ginger juice to aid in absorption. Later, due to fatigue and brain strain, he experienced vomiting. I used the previous formula but omitted Qianghuo, adding fresh ginger and Vitex to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>Chen Xun&#39;s wife had been bedridden for thirteen years. During the Jia Jing period in the year of Gui Mao, she became even more melancholic due to misfortunes. In the third month of the year of Jia Chen, a lump formed under her right shoulder, swollen like a bowl, red on the inside and white outside. First, I prescribed a cooling medication, which did not resolve the issue; then, I used a formula called Shi Xuan San for four doses, which caused slight redness and pain. Upon the visit from Xu Nanlou, I prescribed a combination of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, cinnamon, and ligusticum, leading to the formation of pus. Xu said: &quot;No longer ill,&quot; and took his leave. Later, she experienced dizziness and vomiting, foul chills and shivering, and the pus had cleared. </p>
<p>By chance, I referenced my &quot;Surgical Treatise,&quot; which states: &quot;If at the initial stage there is a small nodule resembling a grain, with no swelling or redness, accompanied by restlessness and constipation, within four or five days, numerous nodules can form, each like a grain, named &#39;Lotus Flower Nodules.&#39;&quot; This initially seemed like a severe condition; although the treatment methods were detailed, I was not well-versed in practice. Xu came to me for diagnosis and I stated: &quot;Spicy and cooling dispersal should be avoided if there is deficiency of both qi and blood.&quot; I then prescribed large doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, rehmannia, ginger, and dang shen. The swelling increased and the pus thickened, requiring the application of a black ointment. After several days, the discharge resembled pieces of greasy film. Each dose of ginseng was increased to eight taels, taking two doses a day, and in over two months, she returned to a stable state.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>Zheng, the envoy, over fifty years old, suffered from a back ailment, his form and evidence both weak, and he used a topical remedy that caused a rupture. However, there was decayed flesh that needed to be removed, but he was afraid and refused, prolonging it for ten days, resulting in all the good flesh rotting. Even though strong doses were given, the poison was severe, and ultimately, it could not be saved. The ancients said that rotten flesh is worse than wolves and tigers, more toxic than bee stings; if left untreated, it can indeed threaten life, truly!</p>
<p>In the guest quarters away from family, in mid-summer, there was another who suffered from a back ailment, swelling over an inch, with small heads resembling the shape of millet, for four days. This was a case of true qi being deficient while evil qi was real, so garlic moxibustion was employed and two doses of a life-saving drink were taken, leading to an immediate retreat of the evil qi; then there was pure supplementation of the true qi, and Shengmai Powder was used instead of tea, greatly diminishing the sore evil. I went elsewhere and returned after three days; he could not eat, the central flesh was dying, his bowel movements were blocked, and his urine was red and turbid. I said: The central flesh is dying, the toxic qi is strong and the spleen qi is deficient; the bowel not moving indicates the intestines are weak and cannot transport; the urine being red and turbid shows spleen deficiency causing fire to sink down, making treatment difficult. He initially wondered if the interruption of tonics was to blame? I said: Yes. Therefore, he urgently took the Six Gentleman Decoction, adding Angelica, Bupleurum, and Cimicifuga; food intake gradually increased, bowel movements resumed, and an external application of black ointment was used on the central area for about three inches. The surrounding redness and swelling gradually subsided, and the central black rotting began to diminish; then Angelica ointment was applied, and Rehmannia Pills were taken alongside the previous medicine, until after a hundred doses, he was cured.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br>Zhi Fang Wang had a back sore that, after bursting, caused his urination to be dribbling and at times involuntary. He experienced thirst and often sought to drink, felt feverish and could not sleep. The sore was red and burning, sometimes feeling like it was scorched. I said: This is a severe case of kidney deficiency. I prescribed the modified Eight Herb Pill combined with Maidong; after a few doses, he recovered.</p>
<p>Governor Zhu Yangshan suffered from a back sore that was swollen and dark in color, slightly swollen with thirst. There were dozens of sores, and his left pulse was strong but weak upon pressure; this pointed to kidney deficiency. I first used two doses of the Lifesaving Decoction to eliminate the poison, then in the morning, I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to strengthen the qi and blood. In the afternoon, I gave the modified Eight Herb Pill, as the kidney qi was still strong enough to bear the poison-clearing medicine, and the original qi had not been depleted. Thus, after several days, pus emerged and the flesh healed.</p>
<p>Lin Ruyu of the Driving Department did not wear cotton in winter and drank cold beverages, boasting of his robustness and mocking my cotton clothing. Upon examining his pulse, it was rapid and strong but lacking force. I told him: The heat must be addressed urgently. During March, he indeed developed heat in the back and constipation. His pulse was thin, so I prescribed the Four Substance Decoction with additional herbs like scutellaria, coptis, and gardenia for several doses, which slightly eased his constipation. I then removed scutellaria and coptis and added ginseng, angelica, and poria for over twenty doses, alongside about half a pound of the previous pills, which reduced his thirst by six or seven and also alleviated the back heat. By summer, he developed a sore on his back, and I used topical ointments to treat and contain it.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>A man with a back ulcer bleeding, feeling restless and thirsty, had a pulse that was strong yet felt absent when pressed. This indicated a loss of blood and restlessness. I prescribed two doses of a blood-replenishing soup with angelica, and he improved slightly; later, I added astragalus and gardenia to the Eight Treasures Decoction for a complete recovery.</p>
<p>He Zhengqing from the Southern Yi Department, a junior minister in the western mountains, when I saw him at another time, I noticed his lips and nose were dark blue-black, and he often scratched his back. When I asked why, he said he had a small sore. I examined it, and it turned out to be a carbuncle. This indicated a severe failure of the spleen and stomach, a sign of being untreatable. Since I had a good relationship with him, I felt sorrowful about his inability to manage his burial arrangements. I thus entrusted his colleague Zhang Donghua and others to strongly persuade him to take restorative measures, but he only excreted purple blood, a sign of extreme deficiency. Some suggested that the toxicity was too severe to allow for pus formation. He then took a purging poison medicine which caused vomiting; his pulse weakened, and he ultimately passed away in the southern region.</p>
<p>A county magistrate had a back ulcer that had turned dark and decayed, feeling as heavy as carrying a stone, which was quite dangerous. He had a good appetite and progressed well with food intake, so I used the Peach Blossom Powder, which gradually turned red and alleviated the heaviness. After another dose, flesh began to grow; I then prescribed a medicine to dispel toxins, and he recovered. This was also a severe toxic condition, and only such potent medicine could treat it. Arsenic was used here, thus the detoxifying treatment proved effective. However, in cases of deficiency in qi and blood, where decaying does not occur, it would be necessary to nourish and support the qi and blood.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>&quot;The Zhao Family Medical Canon&quot; states: A gardener suffered from a troublesome back ailment that was quite severe. He was instructed to obtain five or six taels of gold-silver vine, pound it into pieces, mix it with a small cup of hot wine, stir well, drink the warm juice, and apply the residue to the affected area. After taking this remedy four or five times, he was cured. Finding this method effective, he began to use it for anyone with sores, achieving a successful treatment every time. He then gained health and stability in his family, eventually abandoning his gardening work.</p>
<p>&quot;The Essence of External Medicine&quot; mentions: A man over fifty had a sore on his back for thirteen days, unable to consume any food or drink. His back was hard like carrying a stone, and he remained silent with discomfort. He requested a consultation. Despite the severity of the sore, the skin was purple, but I observed that the roots and foot of the sore were clearly defined, suggesting that the poison had not yet penetrated deeply, indicating it was treatable. It was essential to draw out the toxic gases without allowing them to attack internally. </p>
<p>Herbal medicine was prepared and administered twice, resulting in a significant amount of evil blood being drawn out; additionally, due to his firm pulse leading to constipation, I administered a mixture of Huanglian decoction and pig bile to help relieve the internal pressure. After passing stool twice, both internal and external toxic gases were able to be expelled, allowing him to sleep peacefully at night and relieving most of the heaviness in his back. </p>
<p>Next, I provided medications to eliminate pus and used the mulberry wood moxibustion technique externally. The swelling and hardness gradually began to decompose, and pus started to emerge. After switching to a tonic such as the Fully Nourishing Decoction, supplemented with Mai Men Dong and several doses of Wuyuan, the necrotic tissue detached on its own, and his appetite steadily improved. Over the course of two months of careful regulation, he eventually recovered.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>An old woman nearing seventy suffered from a sore on her back for over half a month, and her condition was utterly alarming. Her family had given up on treatment and were in despair, preparing for her final affairs. They summoned me to examine the child&#39;s ailments, and when I inquired about the situation, the entire family, young and old, expressed that they awaited death at any moment. I insisted on examining her condition; I saw that her sore covered half her back and was swollen. Although the sore was neither elevated nor sunken, when pressed, it felt firm on the outside yet rotten within. The elderly woman&#39;s internal weakness and the pus and toxins trapped inside prevented it from expelling outward. Despite her lack of appetite, I noted that her feet were unaffected and her internal organs had no discoloration, which indicated a possibility of life. The family was stubborn and skeptical, claiming that divination with turtle shells had foretold her inevitable death, so how could treatment possibly save her? I lamented: What a pity! If left untreated for three or four more days, the internal membranes would rupture, and she would surely die. This fate was unjust! The next day, feeling compelled, I went to seek treatment for her.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>Heaving a deep sigh, he said: &quot;I am not forcing him; I truly see that he is alive and cannot bear to abandon him to death. Thus, I desire to treat him, offering medical care without accepting any payment, waiting for the patient to heal and seeing how they compensate me afterward. The crowd is willing to agree. </p>
<p>First, I used an onion and mugwort soup to wash the wound. The surface was covered in rotten, stubborn flesh, so I used a fine needle and sharp scissors to carefully remove two inches of this stubborn flesh and opened the pus channel. Gently pressing with my hands, I drained the collected pus and blood, estimating about three bowls. Those watching could not help but nod in distress. </p>
<p>Once the pus and blood were somewhat drained, I washed the area again with the same soup and sealed it with an ointment. Internally, I prescribed three doses of the Great Restoration Decoction to replenish the vital energy. Later, I used a Ginseng Nourishing Decoction with double the ginseng and white atractylodes, adding peony to it. I also mixed in Eight Flavor Pills and Eight Immortals Cake for nutritional balance, aiming to strengthen the spleen so the patient could eat and the necrotic flesh would regenerate. </p>
<p>Moreover, this woman was diligent in her care and made no major changes; within a hundred days, her wound healed and her body was healthy and stable. From then on, I was believed, with no one doubting my words.&quot;<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>A candidate for the position had passed his fifties, and had a chronic thirst; his body was exceedingly stout, and he had a hair growing from his back, about a foot long. After twelve days, he requested treatment. Upon examining his wound, it appeared slightly swollen, with a pale red color, and the edges were both contracted and dispersed; this indicates a balance of Yin and Yang. Moreover, with a stout person who harbors internal weakness, the wound is large, and without significant nourishment and support, it would be difficult for the wound to heal, and the poison would likely penetrate deeply, which could be too late to address.</p>
<p>At first, I administered a remedy to invigorate his internal health. After fifteen days, I used a fine needle, making three small punctures at the top, to allow the internal toxins a path to exit. Since the condition was severe, I was cautious not to let too much out, lest it exhaust the vital energy and impede the formation of pus. I prescribed a combination of ginseng and astragalus, increasing each to nine grams as an internal remedy, and continued this for twenty days, at which point the pus began to develop.</p>
<p>In the morning, I used a ginseng and angelica preparation; at noon, I prescribed a Ten Complete Decoction with additional ginseng and astragalus totaling twelve grams, with a touch of ophiopogon and schisandra each at three grams. This continued for over a month, as the flesh began to necrose and discharge, with pus flowing like a gushing spring. Occasionally, I used a Holy Recovery Decoction and Eight Immortals Cake for supporting and regulating his condition, bolstering his spleen and stomach to improve his appetite.</p>
<p>Later, concerned that the previous medicines might not be sufficient, I added cooked aconite at three grams to the mixture, pleased that his spleen was strong and the pus was thick and yellow. After forty days, the situation of the wound began to slightly improve.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>It was mid-summer, and the weather was scorching. The patient was very restless, quickly drinking two bowls of cold water. By evening, the sore began to sink, suddenly changing to a dark state, without pain or pus. The body felt cool, and the pulse was thin; there was abdominal pain and coldness in the feet, prompting them to request a consultation. The sore appeared soft and sunken, and the pulse was also faint. This sore had changed due to cold; it required warmth, not spicy heat for restoration. </p>
<p>I urgently prescribed the Twelve Flavor Disperse Formula, doubling the dosages of ginseng and prepared aconite to three qians each. It was ineffective; the medicine could not overcome the cold. I then switched to fresh aconite and ginseng, each five qians, to be taken in the morning and evening. This would warm the body and raise the pulse, making the sore higher and painful again. After two more doses, pus began to flow as before. </p>
<p>Large amounts of pus continued to exit for about a month, totaling over a hundred bowls, without decreasing. The outer skin became red but did not rot. This fat person was externally robust but internally weak, hence the skin did not rot while the inside deteriorated. I then applied Yu Hong ointment on a cotton pad and pushed it inside the sore, covering it with the ointment, which gradually helped the inner decay to peel away. </p>
<p>Ten days later, a large piece of rotten flesh, weighing about six liang, was expelled. After that, the swelling reduced, the pus decreased, and new flesh gradually grew. It took over a hundred days to finally restore health. More than five jin of ginseng and over ten liang of aconite were used to achieve complete safety. If detoxifying and spleen-harming medicines were employed, along with harsh spicy heat for nourishment, how could one hope for recovery?<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br>A local official, aged over seventy years, developed a sore on his right back that had persisted for eight days. Upon examination, the sore, though slightly swollen, was pale and not red, resembling a turtle&#39;s shape, with its roots spreading without being elevated. This was due to the elderly&#39;s declining vitality and blood. The pulse was slightly rapid but strong, indicating that there was still some foundation present; although old, it could still be treated. </p>
<p>I pursued treatment to drain the pus and enhance internal absorption, using medicinal herbs combined with a topical application to promote the formation of pus. After thirteen days, the swelling increased and the color turned more red, but it failed to properly rupture and expel pus, likely due to weak digestion from inadequate nourishment. I prescribed Shenqi Dabu Decoction over several doses, resulting in gradual pus production, but not yet swift or efficient. The stagnation of pus was evidence that the internal membranes were not communicating properly; one must not lament over age but treat more crucial matters. </p>
<p>I then employed a fine needle to open the sore approximately two inches deep, facilitating the drainage of pus. After clearing it with pig&#39;s trotter soup, I applied topical medications once daily, causing the outer layers to gradually degenerate into pus. The patient appeared emaciated and dull, so I administered Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang, increasing the quantities of ginseng and astragalus substantially. Any decaying flesh was removed, and care was taken to nurture any new flesh that desired to form. However, due to age and low vitality, the recovery process was slow. Additionally, I provided ginseng and atractylodes paste for him to take twice daily until the new flesh formed, and after adjusting his diet significantly for seventy-five days, he finally stabilized.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>A scholar, over sixty years old, suffered from a carbuncle on his back for ten days. Upon examining the sore, it was hard and dark purple in color, surrounded by abundant hair, resembling a snail, and about a foot long, with roots extending across half his back. It was high, swollen, shiny, hot, and painful, and his pulse was strong and rapid. This sore was likely caused by the combination of rich food, alcohol, and damp heat. Despite its severity, it was manageable.</p>
<p>He was treated with three types of medicinal applications, which were accordingly administered. The center of the sore, resembling a snail, was meant to be expelled, so a method was employed to draw it out. Additionally, it released foul blood, which was washed with scallion broth, then cleaned and treated with medicine. Paper was applied over it and around the roots with a detoxifying powder to absorb the toxic gases and prevent further expansion.</p>
<p>The following day, treatment continued as before. After three days, the outer flesh gradually began to decay, and additional medication was applied to support the spleen and stomach and to convert the toxins into pus. Early on, he took an eight-herb pill to nourish his kidney water, and the hoof broth was changed. He continued to apply a soothing plaster, waiting for the decay to complete to a depth of about an inch. Gradually, he used Juhong ointment, applying it daily. However, this man had a tendency to drink, and even in illness, he could not restrain himself. </p>
<p>Two months later, although new flesh had formed, it was delicate and could not properly close over the sore. He was thus advised to refrain from drinking. Subsequently, the tender flesh was all cut away, and a plaster was applied for several days, waiting for the flesh to mature and become even. Pearl powder was introduced in small amounts several times until a layer formed over the wound, and it was stabilized after eighty days.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>An elderly man suffered from ulcers for half a month, with the sores running along his spine and swelling throughout his back, from his shoulders down to his waist, resembling a melon shape. The count of sores reached hundreds, and his family believed his condition was too severe for treatment. Upon checking his pulse, it was slightly strong but not forceful, and combined with the swelling that had spread outward. After inquiring about his appetite and tastes, I found that despite his age, he still had some foundational strength. Even in old age, there was no cause for concern.</p>
<p>I first prescribed two doses of a detoxifying powder to help with his situation, which stabilized somewhat; then, I applied the mulberry wood moxibustion method to assist in the decay and drainage. The area was reinforced with an iron tube and bandaged. I also administered a purging powder internally to promote the gradual expulsion of pus. However, due to his age and weakened blood and qi, the flesh did not decay easily. As I examined his flesh and noticed color changes indicating it could not decompose, I carefully used needles and hooks to gradually trim away the decayed tissue, which was about an inch deep and a foot long. Whenever I encountered healthy red flesh, I applied a medicinal ointment.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>The new flesh has grown to about half, and it is the height of winter. The patient opened the wound to wash and examine it themselves, without lighting a fire for warmth, and was additionally covered inadequately, allowing cold to invade from outside. Subsequently, the wound turned pale white, the pus became thin and clear, appetite decreased, and there was difficulty in breathing comfortably. Please observe this. This is due to not following proper care and allowing cold air to invade; the condition could change. Since the wound inherently belongs to Yang, it has not completely lost Yang. If there is no fire in the room to provide warmth, then there is no heat to expel the cold, thus leading to the condition of the open wound. Immediately use a strong scallion soup to warmly wash it. Melt and apply jade-red ointment, and use soft cotton and silk, layered several times, to cover it tightly; internally take Shen Gong Tuo Li San, two doses morning and evening. On the following morning, observe again; the wound will have regained Yang. Afterward, adhere to the prescribed regimen, and within a hundred days, it will be stable.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>An elderly man, over sixty, had been suffering from a back sore for twelve days. Observing the sore&#39;s appearance, it was half swollen and half red, slightly painful and warm. It appeared on the lower back, above the kidney area, evenly raised, about eight inches wide, with the root swelling and a color akin to water. The top was soft and lacking vitality, resembling rot but not entirely rotten. The pulse was floating and large, weak upon heavy pressure; this sore was prone to bursting and not conducive to healing. Therefore, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>The family laughed dismissively and sought the opinion of an old local physician. He noted that the patient’s daily routine was peaceful, his speech clear and sharp, his movements normal, and he found food enjoyable. He declared this a manifestation of the five virtues, a sign of stability like a mountain, and questioned why there should be concern. The family, encouraged by this, eagerly used his prescribed medicine, and gradually there was improvement: pus drained, swelling decreased, necrotic tissue cleared, and new flesh grew. They believed it was a sign of complete recovery.</p>
<p>I once advised the patient’s relatives, saying this illness should not be postponed; recovery would lead to death when the sore was forcibly closed. The crowd viewed me as speaking rashly. Later, when asked about the closure, I estimated it would only be a matter of time, urging them to prepare for the worst, fearing they might run out of time. Within a few days, a change occurred, and he died within four days. Only then did the villagers begin to believe me, and I affirmed my earlier words.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br>A man, sixty-two years old, developed a right tumor. Initially, he used moxibustion, but gradually the condition worsened, becoming high, swollen, hard, and painful. After fifteen days, it had not yet ruptured to discharge pus, and he was feeling increasing discomfort. Fearing the poison had penetrated deeper, he first used a needle to puncture it and then employed cupping techniques, extracting approximately a pound of foul blood. After that, he felt somewhat relieved. He applied a medicine to dissolve the necrotic tissue and covered it with an ointment. After three days, the wound began to decay and rupture. By the twentieth day, proper pus was discharged, the rotten flesh gradually sloughed off, and new flesh started to grow. The methods of treatment beyond this were concluded. However, as the patient and an internal medicine doctor had a close relationship, he entrusted his medication to him without adhering to the surgical remedies I suggested. He insisted on his own views and did not listen to my advice, resulting in excessive and harsh remedies. He took no more than two qian of ginseng daily, believing that was sufficient. I remarked: &quot;That&#39;s not enough.&quot;<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a><br>The treatment should consist of five coins of medicine, along with an additional two coins as a supplement, to properly address the illness. Otherwise, complications are bound to arise. However, they do not believe this. As a result, the patient’s flesh becomes pale and white, the wounds widen, and the pus is thin and watery, leading to decreased appetite; these are clear signs of decline. Even if they later aggressively administer warming and spleen-strengthening tonics, it ultimately proves ineffective, leading to emaciation and foul-smelling pus, extending for up to sixty days, draining their vital energy and blood until death ensues. Then they only regret their choices. They do not understand that for a large sore, producing a bowl of pus each day, three coins of ginseng are essential as a standard. Given that this condition produces pus yielding three bowls daily, administering just two coins of ginseng is considered a major loss with minimal gain—doesn’t this lead to death? Moreover, external medicine often deals with conditions where a breach leads to the leakage of true vital energy; if loss and supplementation conflict, it frequently results in irreparable damage. This stems from a disbelief in tonics and clinging to common misconceptions, ultimately leading to self-destructive outcomes.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a><br>A man nearing sixty in age, during the peak of summer, had over twenty hot sores on his back. His family invited me to look at his grandson&#39;s illness, and when I saw him sitting in the hall, his back was covered with sores. Upon closer inspection, I noticed one sore that was much smaller than the others, but contained a much greater poison. I said, &quot;This sore is not merely a boil; once it erupts, it cannot be managed.&quot; He laughed and replied, thinking there was no serious issue. Later, as he was escorted to the door, I urged him again, saying, &quot;You must quickly seek another physician for treatment; do not delay.&quot; They did not believe me. </p>
<p>Ten days later, his condition slightly worsened, and one doctor treated him, again stating, &quot;It is just a boil.&quot; Another ten days passed, the situation deteriorated, and symptoms of decay emerged. Only then did they start to somewhat believe my earlier words and sought my opinion again. When I entered the hall, he was lying covered with cloth over the sore, and after taking only two or three steps, I turned back. Someone asked, &quot;Why?&quot; I said, &quot;The decay is rising; his death is imminent. There is no need to inspect the sore; prepare for the aftermath instead; he will die in another seven days.&quot; Ultimately, the result was just as I predicted, not off by a moment. This illustrates the folly of avoiding medical attention while ignoring illnesses, which leads to one&#39;s own downfall.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br>The &quot;Comprehensive Book of Jingyue&quot; states: My eldest son was born in the year of Gui Chou. In the fifth month of the year of Yi Mao, at just two years old, he developed a back abscess. At first, there was a sudden slight swelling in his back; after a few days, upon pressing it, the root deepened and grew wider, becoming as large as a bowl, yet the skin color did not change and it was not very painful. After more than ten days, he experienced a slight fever, and the condition worsened. Therefore, we consulted a sore doctor. Some claimed it was a back abscess, others called it phlegm and qi. They all said to avoid all rich foods entirely; thus, we administered a detoxifying medicine. However, this resulted in an increase in fever, and he became more spiritless, unable to eat. I was greatly alarmed and remembered that Danxi said: abscesses arise from accumulated toxins in the organs; one should first strengthen the stomach qi to solidify the foundation and then engage in blood circulation to assist. He also said: when swelling and pain are observed, coupled with weak pulse signs, one should fortify and nourish; if the qi and blood are not deficient, one can ensure a favorable outcome. This is indeed a sound analysis.<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br>Due to previously disregarding the medicine and solely fortifying the vital energy while hosting its poison, three qian of ginseng, one qian of prepared aconite, alongside angelica, cooked rehmannia, roasted licorice, and cinnamon were used. After one dose, the appetite significantly improved, and after another, his spirit was as before. But what spirit was this! Thus, he relaxed his dietary restrictions, and both medicine and food were taken together. After ten doses, pus formed; given the depth of roots and thickness of skin, using needles extracted a great deal of pus. After a month of regulation, he recovered. If trust had been placed in common practitioners, with strict avoidance of warming and nourishing flavors while focusing solely on detoxification, his stomach qi would have daily diminished, the toxic energy would have increasingly invaded, leading to an inability to eat. If it had resulted in internal ulceration, it would have been utterly perilous. Moreover, this child had no signs of deficiency diseases; how could one act carelessly? It was because he presented a yin condition without actual pathogens, but with clear causes present, that he dared to vigorously nourish the spleen and kidneys, ensuring a thorough preservation of health. Alas! The relationship of medicine is always about categorization. Thus, this case is recorded to inform future practitioners. In cases of swelling and abscesses, whenever deficiency signs are absent but there is no evidence of real heat blockage, it is advisable to nourish. In this way, the benefits from those who do not know cannot be adequately expressed in words.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　太阳所谓强上引背者，阳气大上而争，故强上也。　　【 注　强上引背者，头项强而引于肩背也。太阳之脉，上额交巅，从巅别下项，挟脊抵腰中，阳气大而争扰于上，故使其强上也。】<br>　　　　　气府论</p>

<p>　　阴阳不和，则使液溢而下流于阴，髓液皆减而下，下过度则虚，虚故腰背痛而胫酸。　　 【 注　阴阳不和者，少阴与阳明之不和也。阴阳之气不和，则液与精不合，使液溢于骨外而下流于阴矣。液溢于外，则髓液皆减而下，是不能为高矣。下流过度，则骨虚而腰痛胫酸矣。】<br>　　　　　本藏篇</p>

<p>　　足少阴之本，在内踝下上三寸中，标在背俞与舌下两脉也。足厥阴之本，在行间上五寸所，标在背俞也。足太阴之本，在中封前上四寸之中，标在背俞与舌本也。手少阴之本，在锐骨之端，标在背俞也。　　气在胸者，止之膺与背俞。气在腹者，止之背俞。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　　　　玉版篇</p>

<p>　　　　　发背</p>
<p>　　发背之生，积毒脏腑。正气盛，淹留停缓；元气虚，朝轻夕重。如发弓矢，外小内大。内托则生，败毒则毙。治法以参、芪为主，一定之论，百世不易。凡痈发于背，广一尺，深可一寸，虽溃至骨，不穿膜不死。此证六气七情，或因饮食而感，其毒积于脾肚之间，用药先消脾肚中之毒，内外夹攻，斯无患矣。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>　　　　　鱼脊疮</p>
<p>　　鱼脊疮者，脏中积冷，肾气虚寒，故虚热得传经络脊骨之间，发动不拘何处，初生如疽疖，破时黄水流，生白泡，似鱼脊，若不速治，肉烂脓流，命亦难保。先服神功活命汤，次用归芪调荣汤或参芪内托散，外用解毒润肌散擦之，或用金丝膏贴之；洗用猪蹄煎汤，或用地骨皮煎汤，尤妙。<br>　　　　　两头发</p>
<p>　　此证两头小者，四边散攻，乃因饮酒体虚之所致也。而气食相鬬，合阴虚而成之，气虚而散，所以开口而阔，急服内消药，亦宜补阳也。治法与发背肩痈同，前方加减服之。<br>　　　　　肾俞发</p>
<p>　　肾俞之发属阴，人难知识。因受暑湿，并怒气，饮热酒而得之。伤于内肾之间，流毒在肾，急用解内肾之毒，内外攻之。若医缓伤膜者难生矣。切戒怒气行房，稍或一犯，决不可治。治法同发背痈疽，而补肾加黄蘗、知母、没药、广胶。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>　　　　　对心发</p>
<p>　　对心发，此证难治。盖心者君主之官，神明出焉。恬惔虚无，病安从来？心有怫郁，诸病生焉。发于手足者，皆由于心火。故发于心乎，此证发于背脊，与心相对，乃对心发，因心火盛而热气会生于此处，其毒愈盛，急用疏导心火之药解之，用意调处，若合兵法，方有生机。必须戒性，若一怒不能生矣。发于心之侧者，亦可治。并宜黄连解毒汤、护心散、蜡矾丸，日夜服之。<br>　　　　　散走流注发</p>
<p>　　此证发于背胛之间，若气血不调，经络不通，复感六气七情，故毒气乘风热而走是也。乃因风盛而生热之证，热极气盛，气因热之极而走于四散，急宜疏风定热，则气自然而息。若元气盛，初发者，速以艾灸七壮，四围敷药，内服二十四味流气饮，无不愈者。若流注于手足腿者，死无疑矣。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>　　　　　连珠发</p>
<p>　　此疾若阴囊亦肿，小便不通，小腹胀痛。此疽因色欲过度，乃醉饱房事，以伤肾水。得此疾者，必致成串，令人口干，身发寒热，百节皆疼，治以十奇散、酒煎散。　　或患处好肉四边红肿，其色如火，用磁锋砭去恶血，即用鸡子清调乳香末敷之，时时用芭蕉根汁润之，以助药功。<br>　　　　　蜂窝发</p>
<p>　　此疾若肉黑色、青色，中大陷，四围硬肉赤紫色，风毒气伤于腠里，可发出即生，不发出即死。此毒因膏粱之味，温床厚被，醉饱房事，以致五脏积毒不流，积而为痈，则心神恍惚，夜梦不安，小便频数，大便溏泄。此疾串于左胁即死。治宜内托十宣散，连服蜡矾丸，日进五服。脓将透，便服排脓内补十宣散，即内托散，加木香、穿山甲，仍贴金丝膏。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　　　　竟体发</p>
<p>　　此毒发于背脊之间，因暑热之时，空心受其秽气，以致胃气仍败，则致呕逆。如若不治，毒气入内则难生矣。急服乳香托里散，再服五香连翘散、蜡矾丸，外贴金丝膏，内服忍冬酒，一日三服。<br>　　　　　莲子发</p>
<p>　　此疽发于右胛中，恐其毒气奔入心，大要用药散之，敷围药点截住，不令攻心。如在中道，通背皆肿，不可救也。消者可疗。诸疮痛痒，皆属于心。以心生血而行气，主痛。诸疮皆有敷药，就上下打大针三四针为妙，用前化毒消肿散、千金内托散多加黄芪、护心散、蜡矾丸，时刻不可缺。<br>　　　　　上中下三搭手</p>
<p>　　此毒受在五脏六腑毒热，忧怒气壅，伤于肺经，结聚成毒，此是恶证也。当用脑疽发背痈疽等药治之，围药亦然，时进忍冬酒、蜡矾丸。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>　　　　　上中下三发背</p>
<p>　　上发背，受在陶道经，主伤于肺肝心经，惊郁结聚，怒气伤肝，壅出背毒，此乃恶毒证也。先用败毒流气饮，次用护心托里散，后用内托流气饮治之。　　中发背，受在神堂、灵道经，正心毒，心血涌出不能归肝，气血壅在背中，损于肝经，此乃恶证。当用煎药，治宜败毒流气饮。　　下发背，乃受脾肝经络，凝滞于五脏，伤于三经，此是三毒之证也。先用败毒流气饮，后用人参内托散，外用围药傅之。<br>　　　　　缠袋痰注</p>
<p>　　所谓痰注者，何来？六气七情所感，痰不能流行，结于背胛，伏于经络之间，而背为明堂，月深日久，结成囊窠，内连于脏腑，外隔于皮毛，宜早治之。其形或圆或歪，或如米袋，坚硬如石，外用围药，次服人参内托散四五十剂，元气充足，方可用下行剂，下大便痰积数升而愈。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>　　　　　三串毒</p>
<p>　　此证生于背之上下，其形虽一，而中间皮好，但内肉溃烂，初起红色，亦不太痛，日渐溃烂，此证之来，六气七情所感，严寒酷暑所遇，积毒于脏腑，或年老男妇性度怡默而患此者，想平居坐卧湿地而然也。若无外证，得生。若饮食日减，泄泻发热，势难生矣。治法与发背诸痈同。<br>　　　　　肾愈怒发脾痈</p>
<p>　　此证下肾俞双发，因饮热酒行房，怒气伤肝，受湿而得也。阳发于外，可治。痰发阴发伤于肾膜，脓稀者为虚，难治。若老少妇人，性气温和，饮食谨节，又无六情恼怀而亦患此者，乃受地之湿气，或暑月以冷水沐浴而然。脾痈发于左膊之间，初发可用艾火灸之，急服追疔汤，汗之即散。治法服药同前。蜡矾丸甚宜服之。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>　　　　　血溃流注疽</p>
<p>　　此证多生膏粱形重之人，有此疾者，好食煎炒炙煿糖蜜之类。其疽大者如鸡子形，犹如紫李，只肿不红，内串经络之间，流注背节之内，遍身酸疼，百节疼痛，用内托散加木瓜、白芍、连翘，再服乳香护心散、黄矾丸，外用围药傅之，不可迟也。凡用药以意消息，切勿执方对证。<br>　　　　　对脐毒</p>

The back represents Yang, and within Yin, it is the essence of Yin, which is the lungs. 【Note: The heart is a Yang organ located in the upper burner, thus it is the essence of Yang.

<p><strong>Discussion on the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>When two Yang and one Yin give rise to illness, it leads to fright, back pain, frequent yawning, and frequent sighing, known as wind syncope. 【Note: Two Yang and one Yin refer to the conditions of Yangming and Jueyin. The back represents Yang, and Jueyin governs the spring Yang Liver Wood, hence it causes back pain.】</p>

<p>The back is the organ of the chest; when the back curves, the shoulders follow, indicating the organs may be failing. 【Note: Shoulders and back are Yang, while the chest and abdomen are Yin. Yang pertains to organs, while Yin pertains to the viscera. The heart and lungs reside in the chest, and their acupoints correspond to the shoulders and back, hence the back is considered an organ of the chest.**<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the True Discomfort of the Jade Machine</strong></p>
<p>In winter, if the pulse is excessive, it leads to discomfort (and irritability), pain in the spine, and a lack of energy, making one reluctant to speak; if it is insufficient, it causes a feeling of anxiety as if suffering from hunger, coldness in the middle, pain in the spine, fullness in the lower abdomen, and changes in urination. 【Note: The kidneys are the source of vital energy and govern closure and storage. If excessive, energy leaks out, harming the foundation, leading to lethargy and reduced energy. Insufficient yang energy causes pain in the spine. The heart governs speech, and since the root energy is damaged, one loses the desire to speak. If the pulse is insufficient, the interaction of water and fire energies between the heart and kidneys is compromised, leading to a feeling of anxiety similar to that of hunger. In the coldness of the middle, at the end of the rib bones above the kidneys, the deficiency of kidney yang causes this coldness. The kidneys are connected to the bladder; if the kidneys are weak, they cannot transform properly, leading to changes in urination and fullness in the lower abdomen.】 </p>
<p>In spring, if the pulse is insufficient, it causes chest pain that radiates to the back, and fullness in both sides below. 【Note: The yang energy of spring wood arises from the yin of the kidney water. The deficiency of yin energy results in insufficient yang, leading to chest pain radiating to the back. The sides are the area of the liver and kidneys; when the vital energy is deficient and cannot express outwardly, it results in internal fullness.】 </p>
<p>In autumn, if the pulse is excessive, it leads to rebellious qi and back pain with irritation. 【Note: The lungs govern the qi of the entire body; excessive energy results in rebellion outward, leading to back pain. The lung&#39;s acupoint is located at the shoulder and back.】<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on the Principles of Qi and Pathology</h3>
<p>For those with heart ailments, there is pain in the chest, fullness in the sides, pain below the ribs, pain between the shoulder blades, and pain in the inner arms.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The pathway of the Heart Channel (hand Shaoyin) begins in the heart, runs upward alongside the throat, exits beneath the ribs, follows the inner arm down to the middle of the elbow, and continues along the inner side of the arm. The pathway of the Small Intestine Channel (hand Shaoyang) ascends the upper arm, follows the inner shoulder, exits at the shoulder joint, and circles around the shoulder blade. When these two channels are filled with qi, pain results. Fullness in the sides is due to the branches of the Shaoyin being filled and causing pain below the ribs.</p>
<p>For those with lung ailments, symptoms include wheezing, coughing, and reversed qi, along with pain in the shoulders and back, profuse sweating, and pain in the buttocks, thighs, knees, and feet.<br><strong>Note:</strong> The lungs govern qi and derive their origin from the kidneys; the kidneys are the root, and the lungs are the branch. The qi of the mother and son channels is interconnected. Therefore, the pathway of the Foot Shaoyin channel runs directly from the kidneys, penetrating the diaphragm, entering the lungs, and circling the throat, alongside the base of the tongue. When this qi is disrupted, it causes wheezing and coughing. The lung&#39;s acupuncture point is in the shoulder and back area; when qi is reversed upwards, it causes pain in the shoulders and back, leading to sweating; when reversed downwards, it causes pain in the buttocks, thighs, knees, etc.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>To understand the points on the back, first measure the space between the two nipples. Then use another piece of grass to measure this space, halving it, and use the two ends as supports. Next, position this measurement to assess the back, ensuring one end is above, aligned with the spinal prominence, while the two ends below align with the lower end, which corresponds to the Lung point.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: This discussion pertains to the method of identifying five points. The points associated with the five organs are all located on the back, as the back is the hollow of the chest. Therefore, the measurement of the two nipples is first established before determining the points on the back.

[Note: When it strikes the back, the evil resides in the spaces of the back. The protective qi encounters the evil, hence the onset of illness.]</p>
<p><strong>On Pain</strong></p>
<p>When cold qi invades the pulses at the back acu-points, the pulse becomes weak. A weak pulse leads to deficient blood, and deficient blood results in pain. Because the back is associated with the heart, they reinforce each other, causing pain. Pressing on it brings forth heat, and when heat arrives, the pain stops. [Note: The pulses at the back acu-points refer to the Foot Taiyang pulse, which runs along the back, with the five organs and six bowels associated with the Taiyang meridian, hence it is called the back pulse. The blood and qi of the organs converge at the acu-points, so when cold invades, the pulse weakens, leading to blood deficiency, and thus, pain arises.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>When evil qi enters a person, it rides upon the void, penetrating the chest and back, as well as the sides. [Note: The collateral of the three yang channels of the hands and feet all ascend from the neck to the head and face. The chest and back, as well as the sides, also follow from the head and neck down to the chest and shoulders.] When the heart pulse is slightly rapid, it leads to heart pain radiating to the back; if it is slightly large, it leads to heart obstruction radiating to the back, accompanied by profuse tears. [Note: Various rapid pulses represent cold, while the heart is the organ of fire. Slight cold merely affects the boundaries of the heart, thus causing heart pain that radiates to the back; if more pronounced, it becomes excessive; slight excess reverses below the heart, leading to heart obstruction radiating to the back, causing the heart essence to rise with the qi to the eyes, resulting in tears.] When the lung pulse is slightly rapid, it indicates lung cold heat, laziness, coughing up blood, and radiating to the lower back, chest, and if there are nasal polyps, nasal obstruction; when slightly large, it indicates lung obstruction, radiating to the chest and back, causing aversion to sunlight. [Note: Lung cold heat refers to cold or heat on the skin. Cold on the skin results in slight rapidity. The lungs govern qi; thus, laziness and coughing up blood radiate to the lower back, chest, and nose, as if there were polyps causing obstruction, all due to deficiency and cold of lung qi. When qi is mildly excessive above, it indicates lung obstruction radiating to the chest and back, as the qi rises from below. With diminished yin blood, there is an aversion to sunlight, as metal fears fire.] When the kidney pulse is markedly slow, it leads to a bent spine.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Governing Vessel is associated with the kidneys and runs along the spine. If it becomes relaxed, the spine may become bent.</p>
<p>The Bladder channel of the Foot Taiyang causes headaches when in motion, with symptoms such as feeling like the eyes are popping out, neck tension, back pain, a feeling of fracture in the waist, inability to bend the thigh, knots in the knees, and splitting pain in the ankles, which leads to ankle cramping. This channel governs diseases related to tendons, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, mania, headaches in the temples and neck, yellowing of the eyes with tears, nosebleeds, and pain in the neck, back, waist, buttocks, knees, and feet, to the point that the little toe is unusable. </p>
<p>The Taiyang energy stems from the water of the Bladder, making it the governing energy of all Yang. The gentle quality of Yang nurtures the tendons, hence the diseases related to the tendons manifest as hemorrhoids. If the channels sink and are thin, it results in malaria, while reverse flow downwards leads to epilepsy and mania. Symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, eye issues, back and knee pain are all conditions resulting from pathways in the channels. </p>
<p>The Foot Shaoyin channel runs along the spine and is associated with the kidneys, connecting to the Bladder. The differentiation of the Governing Vessel is termed &quot;Changqiang,&quot; which runs alongside the spine up to the neck and is situated between the shoulder blades; when it is full, the spine is strong.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p>The five organs have five sections in the body: the first is the lower abdomen, the second is the calves (the calves are related to the spleen); the third is the back; the fourth corresponds to the associations of the five organs; the fifth is at the neck. If there are carbuncles or sores in these five sections, it results in death. </p>
<p>Those external conditions, such as skin being yang and bones being yin, indicate that carbuncles arise between the skin, flesh, and bones. This suggests that each of the five organs has five sections, and if the yin and yang of one section are not harmonious, it leads to stagnation and results in carbuncles. The &quot;lower abdomen&quot; relates to the kidney, the &quot;calf&quot; relates to the spleen, the &quot;back&quot; corresponds to the lung, while the associations of the five organs refer to the five vertebrae&#39;s heart associations. The &quot;neck&quot; corresponds to the liver. The classic text states: the emergence of carbuncles does not originate from external factors but from accumulated subtleties. Therefore, if there are carbuncles in these five sections, it signifies a gradual accumulation of toxic stagnation from the five organs, manifesting externally due to disharmony in blood and qi, resulting in death if present in these areas.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>For the illness of chest blockage, characterized by wheezing, coughing, spitting, pain in the chest and back, shortness of breath, a deep and slow pulse at the cun position, and a tight and rapid pulse at the guan position, use a decoction of Luo Han Qi Bai and white wine as the principal remedy. If there is chest blockage causing inability to lie down, and heart pain radiating to the back, use a decoction of Luo Han Qi Bai and Ban Xia as the principal remedy. For heart pain radiating to the back, and back pain radiating to the heart, use Wu Tou and Chi Shi Zhi pills. If there is cold in the heart, the person suffers from heart pain similar to eating garlic; if severe, heart pain radiates to the back, and back pain radiates to the heart, resembling poison. If the pulse is floating, recovery will follow self-vomiting. </p>
<p>For upper abdomen diseases, when phlegm causes fullness, wheezing, coughing, vomiting, and if accompanied by chills, fever, back pain, and lower back pain, with tears streaming from the eyes, the person may experience tremors and spasms, suggesting there may be concealed drinking.</p>

<p><strong>Pain related to the organs, deficiency, excess, and cold</strong></p>
<p>When the heart pulse is slightly rapid, and heart pain radiates to the back, there is no food intake; if it is slightly stronger, it leads to back pain and excessive tearing. Overactivity of the lungs causes reversed qi with chest fullness and back pain; if deficient, it leads to shoulder and back pain. Cold in the upper jiao impedes food intake, resulting in vomiting sour fluid, radiating chest and back pain, dryness of the throat, and inability to take in fluids.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Bladder Excess Heat</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse is strong in the middle of the right wrist, it signifies excess yang, particularly affecting the foot taiyang channel.

<p><strong>Back Disorders</strong></p>
<p>Any person who consumes metals or stones must labor their entire body and not indulge in comfort. Those who do otherwise often experience agitation. Furthermore, one must not excessively warm themselves according to their liking. It is necessary to resist desires for warmth and seek the cold; although this might cause discomfort at the time, it will ultimately be beneficial for the body and eliminate concerns of agitation.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers</strong> [Jin, Dou Hanqing]</p>
<p><strong>Back Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of sores on the back results from accumulated toxins in the organs. If the righteous qi is strong, the condition lingers; if the original qi is weak, it tends to worsen by night. The sores appear like an arrow, small outside but large within. If contained properly, they will heal; if not, they can lead to death. For treatment, ginseng and astragalus should be the primary herbs; this principle remains unchanged for centuries. If an abscess appears on the back, measuring a foot wide and an inch deep, even if it ruptures down to the bone, as long as the membrane is not pierced, it is not fatal. This condition relates to the six qi and seven emotions or may arise from diet; its toxins accumulate in the spleen and abdomen. Medications should first eliminate the toxins in the spleen and abdomen, applying internal and external treatments to ensure safety.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fish Spine Boils</strong></p>
<p>Fish spine boils occur due to accumulation of cold in the internal organs and deficiency of kidney Yang, causing virtual heat to transmit through the meridians and spine. This can appear anywhere in the body, initially resembling sores. When they burst, yellow fluid flows out, forming white blisters that look like fish spines. If not treated promptly, the flesh may rot and pus may flow, making survival difficult. First, take the Shen Gong Huo Ming Decoction, then use Gui Qi Tiao Rong Decoction or Shen Qi Nei Tuo Powder. Externally, apply Detoxifying and Moisturizing Powder, or use Jin Si Ointment. Washing with pig trotters broth or using decocted Earth Bone Bark is particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Double-Ended Hair</strong></p>
<p>In cases of double-ended hair, which is small at both ends and scattered around the sides, this is caused by body weakness from drinking alcohol. It results from a conflict between Qi and food, leading to Yin deficiency. Due to Qi deficiency, the hair opens and widens, necessitating urgent internal medicinal treatment for resolution, and it’s advisable to also tonify Yang. The treatment method is similar to that for back and shoulder sores, with adjustments to the formula as needed. </p>
<p><strong>Kidney Shu Hair</strong></p>
<p>Kidney Shu hair is associated with Yin, often overlooked. It occurs due to summer dampness and anger, as well as drinking hot alcohol. This injures the internal kidneys, allowing toxic substances to flow into them. Quickly detoxify the internal kidney poison, attacking both internally and externally. If the physician is slow in treating the membrane, survival is unlikely. Completely avoid anger and sexual activity; even slight transgressions should not be treated. The treatment method is the same as for back boils, but supplement the kidneys with ingredients like Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, Myrrh, and Guang Jiao.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>Heart fire disorder is difficult to treat. The heart is the ruler&#39;s office, from which spirit and clarity emerge. When calm and empty, how can illness arise? If the heart is upset, various illnesses will emerge. Conditions that manifest in the hands and feet all stem from heart fire. Therefore, when symptoms arise from the heart, they manifest in the back, opposing the heart; this is termed heart fire disorder. Due to the excess heart fire, heat energy accumulates in that area. As the toxicity increases, it is urgent to use medications that clear and regulate the heart fire. Careful intention must be applied, akin to military strategy, to have a chance for recovery. One must control their temperament; a single burst of anger can hinder recovery. Those symptoms arising on the side of the heart can also be treated. It is advisable to take Huang Lian Jiedu Decoction, Hu Xin San, and La Fan Wan, day and night.</p>
<p><strong>Scattered and Flowing Qi Disorder</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises between the shoulder blades, where if the qi and blood are unbalanced, the meridians obstructed, and one is affected by external elements and internal emotions, toxic qi becomes stimulated by wind and heat, causing it to disperse. This occurs due to excessive wind generating heat; when heat is extreme, qi becomes overloaded and scatters. Urgent relief is needed to disperse the wind and settle the heat to allow qi to naturally rest. If the vital energy is strong at the onset, one should promptly apply moxa on seven spots, apply medicine around the area, and take a decoction of twenty-four herbs for dispersing qi; recovery is almost certain. If the symptoms flow into the hands, feet, or legs, there is no doubt of a grim outcome.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p>This illness manifests with swelling of the scrotum, difficulty urinating, and abdominal distention and pain.

Those afflicted with this illness will develop a series of symptoms, causing dryness of the mouth, chills and fever throughout the body, and pain in all joints. It should be treated with the Ten Marvels Powder and Liquor-Cooked Powder. If the affected area has good flesh with red and swollen edges that look like fire, use a magnetic stone to draw out the bad blood, followed by applying a mixture of chicken egg and frankincense powder. Regularly use banana root juice to moisten the area to enhance the effectiveness of the medication.</p>

If the disease erupts, it can heal, but if it does not, it can lead to death. This toxicity arises from a rich diet, excessive warmth from heavy bedding, drunkenness, and indulgent sexual activity, causing the five organs to accumulate toxins that do not flow, eventually forming a carbuncle, resulting in mental confusion, restless nights, frequent urination, and loose stools. If this illness causes a series of symptoms on the left side, the outcome is death. The treatment should involve the internal use of the Ten Clear Powder and taking Wax Alum Pills five times daily.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Upper, Middle, and Lower Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>Upper back pain is related to the Taoist meridians, primarily affecting the lungs and liver. This condition can be caused by emotional distress leading to anger, which can injure the liver and result in toxins accumulating in the back. This is a serious condition. First, administer the Detoxifying Flowing Qi Decoction; next, use the Heart Protecting Dispersion; and finally, treat it with the Internal Flowing Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>Middle back pain is linked to the Spirit Hall and Spiritual Path meridians, causing heart toxicity. The heart&#39;s blood cannot return to the liver, resulting in stagnation of Qi and blood in the back, damaging the liver meridian. This is a severe condition. Herbal decoctions should be used to administer the Detoxifying Flowing Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>Lower back pain involves the Spleen and Liver meridians, causing stagnation within the internal organs and damaging three meridians. This represents the condition of the three toxins. First, use the Detoxifying Flowing Qi Decoction; then apply the Ginseng Internal Dispersion, and for external application, use surrounding medicinal herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>What is meant by phlegm accumulation? It arises from the influences of the six energies and seven emotions, leading to phlegm that cannot circulate, becoming trapped between the shoulder blades and resting within the meridians. The back is a significant area, and over time this can lead to the formation of a pouch, connecting internally to the organs and externally to the skin. It should be treated promptly. The shape may vary - it could be round, oblique, or resemble a grain bag, and feel hard like a stone. For treatment, apply surrounding herbs externally and take 40 to 50 doses of the Ginseng Internal Dispersion. Once the vital energy is sufficient, one may use purgatives, leading to the elimination of several liters of phlegm and achieving recovery.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p>This condition arises on the upper and lower back. Although its appearance is uniform, the skin in the center is fine, but the internal flesh is rotting. It initially presents as red and is not too painful, gradually worsening over time. The origin of this condition is attributed to influences from the six Qi and seven emotions, as well as exposure to severe cold and extreme heat, causing toxic accumulation in the organs. It may also afflict older men and women who are usually calm and silent, likely due to habitual sitting or lying in damp conditions. If there are no external symptoms, it can survive. However, if there is a decrease in appetite, diarrhea, or fever, survival becomes difficult. The treatment approach is similar to that used for back abscesses.</p>
<p><strong>Kidney-Related Anger Causing Spleen Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition occurs with dual eruptions at the lower back&#39;s kidney points due to consuming hot wine during intercourse, combined with anger that harms the liver and causes dampness. External Yang manifestations are treatable. If the phlegm causes Yin damage to the kidney membrane, and the pus is thin, it indicates weakness and is hard to treat. If older women, who are generally warm-tempered, regulate their diet and are not troubled by emotional disturbances, also suffer from this condition, it is likely due to dampness from the ground or bathing in cold water during hot months. Spleen abscess appears between the left shoulder blades; when it first manifests, it can be treated with moxibustion. Quickly taking a decoction to disperse it and sweating it out can help. The treatment method with medications is the same as before. Wax alum pills are very suitable for use.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>To investigate the cause of the illness, there may be wind, qi, food, drug toxicity, or physical strain. Wind tends to cause itching, qi often causes pain, food leads to chills and fever, drug toxicity results in hardness, and strain leads to weakness. Wind, qi, and food accumulation are easier to treat and require Er Xiang San. Drug toxicity combined with strain is more complicated to heal.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Severe Pain with Cold Sensation</strong></p>
<p>When afflicted by wind, one may experience severe pain in the waist and spine. Wind and heat obstruct the qi, causing stagnation of the muscles and constriction of the vessels, resulting in a stiff and painful spine. In cases of cold damage, when the evil heat is on the surface, the back will certainly feel stiff and the body will be tight. In cases of Taiyang syndrome, the spine is stiff and the pulse is superficial, without sweating. With a mixed condition of yin and two yang diseases, one may experience shock, back pain, and sighing; this is termed &quot;wind seizure.&quot; It is due to the earth element of the stomach being overcome by the wood element of the liver, with wind overpowering dampness, failing to regulate kidney water, causing an upward reversal. Wind in the kidney leads to spinal pain, making it difficult to stand upright. When cold enters the meridians, it causes stagnation and tears, hindering the flow of qi, resulting in pain pulling between the heart and back. If qi travels up to the wind palace, it results in &quot;wind in the brain,&quot; causing cold sensations in the back.</p>
<p><strong>Back Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>At the onset of a back ulcer, one can use the Zangyong Pill and Yuzhu Powder as a powerful remedy, administering it to the internal organs a dozen or more times. With a needle, prick the swollen area to draw out blood, doing this three times. In severe cases, blood may also be drawn from the Baihui and Weizhong regions, followed by applying Yangqishi Powder. It is not advisable to casually take internal tonics with Guigui, especially when cooked with alcohol. The back is considered yang in men, and applying heat to heat could be excessive. If the ulcer shows little improvement, or if the ulcer’s edges have not closed, or if the scab has not formed, but there is wind itch, one may use internal tonics to dispel wind evils. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: Wind-cold leads to sweating, shoulder and back pain, and incomplete urination. When wind-heat invades the lungs, it severely obstructs lung qi. One should expel the wind-heat and promote qi; Fangfeng Decoction is the main remedy. For shoulder and back pain, do not look back; this is due to qi stagnation in the Taiyang channel, and one should disperse it with wind herbs.</p>
<p>As for the back abscess, it first appears the size of a millet grain, itchy and painful with a distinct feeling. If touched and ruptured, it will expand and exhibit a red, swollen, and heavy sensation, pulling and causing pain in the ribs. After several days, the skin increasingly feels hot, with chills and thirst. The swelling spreads, with pus oozing, and if it does not rupture for days, and suppression leads to bleeding, it is called a back abscess. </p>
<p>There can also be an initial stage with no head, swelling three to four inches wide, first felt as dull pain; after several days, if the skin appears smooth and soft, it can lead to fever, chills, headache, and thirst; this is called a back boil. This condition is particularly severe. The initial formation of these abscesses is mostly due to rich foods and thick clothing. Thick warm clothing invites cold easily, while excessive rich foods create heat within the five organs. When the organs accumulate heat, blood flow is obstructed and toxic qi stagnates. The pathogenic qi is trapped, heat attacks the blood, and when the blood stagnates, it leads to meat rotting into sores. A mild case is a furuncle, a severe one is a boil, and a deep case is an abscess. There are also instances where the condition arises from the use of metals or stones, as well as cases where individuals who have never taken such substances still develop this illness. This is attributed to ancestral toxic influences being passed down. Once this disease first emerges and is recognized as an abscess, prompt treatment is advisable.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

Such treatments are to be administered while awaiting the formation of pus. Prior to this, do not use various medicines for healing, to settle the patient&#39;s mind; be careful not to provoke anger. Once the pus has formed and ruptured, it is advisable to take Five-Spice Decoction, along with Neituoli San, Fuling Decoction, and Danggui Neituoli San. If there is unquenchable thirst, take Zhuye Huangqi Decoction or Ruxiang San. Do not induce great heat; avoid bitter cold drugs such as Dahuang and (Shibu) Nitre. If taking purgative medicines results in persistent diarrhea, it can be fatal. If there is still necrotic tissue in the wound and the pus is not flowing well, use destructive medicines, or apply a binding agent, topped with powdered deer antler mixed with vinegar to create a paste for application. As necrotic tissue recedes and healthy tissue gradually forms, use Shou Pus San and Cuixia San for binding. If the toxicity of the sore has not fully dissipated, be cautious not to use muscle-generating medicines too early; even if recovery seems possible, the problem is likely to recur.

<p><strong>Cold Pain</strong></p>
<p>The area between the shoulder blades is often cold, caused by phlegm. Those who are good at treating phlegm do not treat the phlegm directly but instead address the qi; when the qi flows smoothly, the body’s fluids will also flow in accordance with it. Generally, individuals experience a cold sensation in the back as if a line has been drawn, which is also caused by phlegm, and it is advisable to expel it. For pain in the spine and shoulder blades, it is recommended to use a decoction of Atractylodes.</p>
<p><strong>Back Boils</strong></p>
<p>Boils on the back initially present as swelling due to the accumulation of qi and blood, which then transforms the flesh into pus, causing pain mostly at the onset of the boil. Once the pus is discharged and the swelling subsides, the pain will gradually lessen; however, if pain reoccurs, this indicates deficiency, and nourishment is needed. If there is contact with foul qi, harmonization is advisable. For wind-cold invasion, warmth and dispersion are recommended. In cases of deficiency and weakness, where the protective and nutritive qi are blocked, with a sensation of heaviness as if bearing a stone, do not use aromatic and drying herbs; instead, use Kidney Qi Pills or Tuo Li San.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Back Pain</strong></p>
<p>There are those who consume gold and stone to enhance desire, which leads to the depletion of vital energy and an excess of toxic substances. Gold and stone are similar to the lungs, and since the lungs are connected to the kidneys, this often results in back pain. There are also treatments using soft-shelled turtles; they can be used for back pain because the yang energy of the turtle gathers in the upper back, making it suitable for medicinal use. If toxins arise in the lower regions, and one cannot use warming herbs such as Aconite or Cinnamon, with exterior pain and internal cold, one should use Five-Spice Decoction. For individuals with back sores or those suffering from excessive bleeding after sores have erupted, and where bodily fluids are scant, Muscle Change Powder is recommended. If toxins first manifest with headaches and body aches, alternating between chills and fever, it is likely that external pathogens are present, and one should administer Xiang Su Decoction with additions of Chuanxiong, Bai Zhi, Fang Feng, Dang Gui, and Chen Pi.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aversion to Cold Associated with Fluid Disorder</strong></p>
<p>Aversion to cold in the back indicates phlegm and fluid. Zhang Zhongjing states: if there is retained fluid under the heart, the person experiences aversion to cold in the back, feeling like ice; thus, Poria Pill is the remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with the Lungs</strong></p>
<p>Shoulder and back pain relates to the lung territory. The classic text states: &quot;Western winds arise in autumn, and diseases are in the lungs, manifesting in the shoulders and back.&quot; Therefore, autumn conditions can lead to illnesses affecting the shoulders and back. Additionally, it is stated: &quot;Excessive lung condition in autumn leads to illnesses that result in reversed qi, causing back pain and irritability.”<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Conditions Related to Heat</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: When the year is excessively hot, the people suffer from shoulder and back heat. It also states: In the presence of lesser yin affecting Heaven, where heat overwhelms, there are pains in the shoulder and back, especially in the area of the shoulder blade. Additionally, it mentions: When the year&#39;s metal is insufficient, diseases manifest internally in the chest and sides, externally on the skin. Treating these with cold remedies is the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Loss in the Back</strong></p>
<p>To treat hair loss in the back, Sea藏 (a herbal remedy) uses the Deadly Dan and Cang Er formula. One utilizes rhubarb and oyster shell, while the other uses Cang Er, indicating a distinction between internal and external. Previously, using the Deadly Dan with two medicines shows their different effects; this is due to the changes in diet. The pulse can be deep and slippery, indicating that dampness from the ground affects the flesh and tendons; if the pulse is floating and slippery, there will be differences in discharge and hair loss.</p>
<p>Among humanity&#39;s greatest concerns, hair loss in the back is one of the five types: </p>
<ol>
<li>Yang toxin. This arises from wind and heat, either causing heat toxin to lead to excessive thirst or manifesting after suffering from cold damage, with residual yang toxin accumulating at the back. It does not matter how many vertebrae are involved; it simply arises from between the two sides of the spine and extends up to the waist, often presenting as heat throughout the back, red, purple, or flame-like, with pus that is hard to generate. Once formed, pain persists; when it seems to subside in a few days, it is merely a deceptive appearance. This is an internal attack causing flesh to sink, which cannot be treated.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></li>

<li><p>The second type is a toxic boil appearing on the back. This condition arises from cold energy and starts as small as millet grains. If emotions are unhappy, it causes dull pain directly in the chest, leading to heart disquiet and a heavy head, with chills and fever resembling malaria. After five to seven days, it will begin to swell and spread, making it difficult to contain. There is pus accumulating inside, deep and slow. If it hasn&#39;t broken out yet, it&#39;s best to urgently use tonic herbal medicine to nourish the qi and externally apply poultices to draw out the pus. If pus is observed, it is advisable to act quickly; if there is no pus, healing may occur on its own, but not until later.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third type occurs in individuals who frequently consume medicines made from metals or stones, resulting in toxicity and stagnation that causes boils. Initially, it manifests like a red rash, gradually opening up like a burn; the face turns crimson, and there is anxiety and restlessness within the chest, accompanied by extreme thirst and a preference for cold. These sores are difficult to form and, when they do, startle others more than those from either yin or yang toxins. Therefore, there is a prescription for antidotal medicine to treat the internal toxicity of metal and stone.

This ailment is not acquired recently; rather, it results from long-term accumulation in the organs. When one is hungry and fatigued, they eat and then sleep; or they consume excessive amounts of rich, greasy, and cold food and drink, causing obstruction in the chest. With unchecked indulgence in the wind, the spleen&#39;s energy becomes deficient, unable to resist the accumulation, resulting in toxicity attacking the back. The pain does not discriminate by the number of vertebrae but begins as small lumps like marbles, later growing to the size of fists, hard as stone, causing widespread pain, stiff limbs, bitter mouth, dry tongue, abdominal distress, and difficulty with urination and defecation. After ten days, there may be swelling in the head, face, hands, and feet, alongside gastrointestinal leakage. The urgent pain signifies this condition. If there is a tendency to swell, immediate use of swelling-relief remedies is essential, and the issue must be treated without delay; pus and fluid should not be allowed to accumulate. Otherwise, neglect can lead to skin necrosis, bone injury, and muscle decay, resulting in increased pus production, internal disintegration from external pathogens, leading to death. </p>

It begins with a swelling that is dark blue or black like a boot, accompanied by a hard pain, deeply affecting the muscles and bones, reaching the marrow. Pressing it feels like touching wood or stone; only by pressing harder can one feel a painful spot. After five to seven days, the toxic Qi rises, causing a shallow, swollen area that turns pale blue, resembling the effect of a punch. There may be chills akin to malaria, and symptoms of wind exposure, with the head shifting and the mouth skewed, hands and feet feeling cold and in reversal, the eyes appearing dark with excessive whites, sluggish. This indicates an internal struggle with evil Qi. It is urgent to expel three to five liters of clear blood to allow the yellow pus and white fluid to flow out. The skin remains neither relaxed nor slow but urgent; the swelling and pain do not cease until the color fades and the heat and pain finally subside. It’s advisable to urgently expel the pus and toxic Qi outwards, as it does no harm. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it first appears like a grain of millet, sometimes as large as a bean, and is level with the flesh, it may be red, occasionally causing itching and pain. During the itching, be careful not to scratch it open; this indicates a disorder in the five organs leading to a boil. Its symptoms are of yin nature, reflecting that toxic gas has accumulated deeply within. Though it progresses slowly, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>If it first appears as large as a broad bean, the body heats up; the area of the boil swells and is hot and painful. This is an external outbreak; even if it is as large as a basin, treating it properly will certainly lead to recovery—this is a manifestation of yang.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the body does not feel hot and there is a sense of fatigue, the boil is also not warm. After several days, it gradually enlarges, without swelling or pain, sinking down and rotting. This indicates an internal outbreak; even immortals cannot remedy this—this is a manifestation of yin deficiency.</p>
<p>At first, when swelling occurs, treating it with moxibustion within three days will yield results. If pus forms within eight days and proper guiding techniques are applied, it will also lead to healing. If one engages in labor before it has healed, it will worsen. Care in diet will help in recovery. Managing emotions will also assist. Aggressive treatment of the swelling will lead to complications, as will rushed treatments. Disregarding the risk of it spreading will lead to improvement.</p>
<p>If one waits for the pus to come out on its own without any guiding treatment, it may lead to death. If there is no internal attack and guiding treatment is applied with the use of needles and moxibustion, recovery is possible; however, if internal issues have arisen and treatments are applied afterward, it may result in death.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When pus and heat pain are severe, those previously treated may survive; however, if the condition has progressed and becomes internal, death is certain. If pus forms but does not drain and only topical medicine is applied, death will occur. In cases of red or white dysentery with severe Qi stagnation, it indicates internal attack; treatment will be ineffective, and death is inevitable. Infected boils, if not treated, will have a survival rate of only five out of ten, while untreated carbuncles will have a mortality rate of ten out of ten. Those with mild swelling and pain sensitivity will surely die. Without encountering effective methods, one will die. If treatment does not adhere to the proper timing, death is assured. Those foolishly adhering to their own desires and indulging in their emotions will die.</p>
<p>In general, for boils and carbuncles on the back, regardless of size, whether painful or not, hot or cold, as long as the swelling increases to over one foot, if it is red and swollen with heat, immediate use of urgent remedies to reduce the red swelling should be applied without allowing drainage. Center treatment involves using remedies to draw out pus and disperse toxins, urgently expelling toxins while internally administering remedies to drain pus and consolidate toxins. Wait for the pus to form, then successively drain the abscess, observing the state of the sore&#39;s size and depth to allow the pus to release. If the pus flows abundantly, urgent internal nourishment is required; even if the abscess is opened with little pus, further draining and toxin expulsion is necessary.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Be cautious not to allow a swelling to recur; it is essential to alleviate pain and reduce swelling. If the patient feels light and comfortable, it indicates a favorable response to the illness. It is crucial to regulate diet carefully. When heat and toxins are prevalent, one may experience intense thirst and should avoid excessive consumption of cold water and cold drinks. This is due to toxic energies attacking the heart, leading to dry mouth and discomfort. Instead, one should use heart-nourishing medications to support the internal organs. Nourishing refers to ingredients like ginseng and astragalus, while expelling pus includes substances like soapberry thorns.</p>
<p>For furuncles, if they arise on the hip and back, particularly at the heart and pericardium points, if not needled within twenty days, it can be fatal. They can be needled after ten days. If the color is reddish-black with clear pus, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>For special furuncles, if they occur at the lung and liver points, if not needled, they lead to death within twenty days. They can be needled after eight days. If the color is deep red with hidden, pepper-like elevations, it is fatal.</p>
<p>For the dual-qi furuncle, which can be broad or small on the back, exhibiting swelling and heat, they can be needled after ten days. Expelling pus, regardless of how deep or shallow, is necessary. If the patient experiences thirst and fatigue, and no pus is observed within ten days, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>For tendon furuncles, if they occur on both sides of the spine along the large tendons, with a bluish color, they can be needled after eight days.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Individuals with a consistently cold back often suffer from phlegm and dampness; they should take a decoction for phlegm combined with Suzi Decoction to relieve qi. If the back feels cold, it can have both yin and yang manifestations: in the case of a lesser yin pattern of cold damage, the back will feel unbearably cold while the mouth is warm; in the yangming pattern, the back feels cold and the mouth is dry. This helps distinguish between cold and heat. Heat in the back is attributed to the lungs, as the lungs are situated in the upper jiao, hence the heat manifests there. </p>
<p>For dampness, if the back is stooped and the feet have contracted rendering them almost useless, one can take a small amount of sweet hemp to be stewed with pig kidneys; if there’s vomiting and diarrhea, this will cure it.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Back Bumps and Swelling:</strong></p>
<p>If a back bump causes heat and pain, is red in color with thirst, and has a rapid, strong pulse, one should first take the Life-Saving Drink, followed by the Decoction to Clear the Heat and Remove Toxins. If the swelling is not hot, has slight pain, is dark in color, causes thirst, and has a weak rapid pulse, it is due to kidney deficiency; one should use the Decoction to Clear the Heat. If there is reduced appetite, take Six Gentlemen Decoction with ginger. If there’s evening heat and yin deficiency, use the Four Substances Decoction with ginseng and atractylodes, or Kidney Qi Pill. If cold feels increasingly bad around the body, this indicates yang deficiency; use only ginseng soup or the Ten Complete Tonics Decoction. Frequent urination suggests taking the Eight Flavor Pill. If appetite is diminished at the onset, it indicates an overwhelming pathogen and spleen deficiency, requiring urgent use of the Decoction to Tonify the Middle and Boost Qi for rescue. Nowadays, people solely rely on the Sai Ming Dan or Yao Jin for cases due to anger or food poisoning and in obese individuals, which might suffice; yet in thin individuals or cases driven by sexual desire, it can inversely cause depletion of yin leading to thirst and diarrhea, or obstructing blood and toxic qi which can be fatal within ten days if not properly treated. Generally, humid bumps with robust qi and blood are easier to treat. If the swelling does not respond to detoxifying medication, it indicates that toxicity exceeds qi and blood, which can be fatal in a few days.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>Although back carbuncles are governed by the bladder and governor vessels, all five organs are connected to the back. They may arise from overeating rich foods, emotional distress, or physical exertion, leading to depletion of water and inflammation of fire, excessive phlegm, and heat in the blood. They can also be triggered by external evils and toxins, appearing anywhere, commonly under the shoulder or along the spine, due to dietary intake of toxins, extending one foot wide and one inch deep. Even if festering internally, if the membrane is not pierced, it will not be fatal; immediate treatment for the toxins in the spleen and abdomen is required, taking heart-protecting powder internally and applying topical medicine externally to prevent distress in the heart. The primary course of action is to take medicine to cut it off. If there is swelling along the spine, it is hopeless.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Severe heart disturbances arise from an excess of heart fire, leading to concentrated heat in this area. The toxicity becomes intense and aggressive, necessitating the urgent use of remedies to clear the heart fire.</p>
<p><strong>Flowing Disturbance</strong><br>Flowing disturbances disperse and escape; poisonous vapors ride the wind and heat, so it is crucial to disperse the wind and calm the heat for treatment, allowing the energy to stabilize.

<p><strong>Turtle Shape Disturbance</strong><br>This disturbance has both ends pointed, with the sides spreading out widely, resembling the shape of a turtle.

<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case</strong><br>The moxibustion method and medications:<br>The &quot;Essentials&quot; states: The classics say all pain, itching, sores, and lesions belong to heart fire. Previous practitioners noted that carbuncles and abscesses often occur in those who labor heavily in the stone industry. For anyone over the age of forty who develops sores on their back or elsewhere, it is advisable to calm the heart and seek early treatment. These symptoms are like a tiger entering a home; if handled poorly, they will harm the person. First, use internal remedies to disperse toxicity, followed by Lianqiao Wuxiang Decoction, and additionally use the method of moxibustion on the foot Sanli point, or moxibustion with garlic to expel the toxins. The presence of evil causes energy deficiency; if left unattended, the illness becomes severe. Therefore, if carbuncles or abscesses have not burst, internal organs are still harboring toxins, and not even a bit of heat-inducing medicine should be used. If the carbuncles or abscesses have burst, and the internal organs are already depleted, not even a bit of cold medicine should be used.

If there is spleen deficiency with phlegm stagnation or cold invasion, or if there is pain affecting the spleen and stomach, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used.

<p><strong>Life and Death Signs</strong></p>
<p>Question: Some illnesses are severe and lead to death, while others are mild yet still result in death. How can one differentiate between conditions that indicate life or death? </p>
<p>Answer: If there is an abscess on the back that penetrates the internal membrane, it is a sign of death; this refers to the area above the liver. If there is yet no penetration but the face turns blue and the lips black, with dark stool, it indicates death; this refers to organ deterioration with stagnant blood. </p>
<p>There are various causes for the conditions mentioned, including weakness of the original qi leading to internal toxicity, initial manifestations that fail to promote internal harmony, excessive toxicity that fails to dissipate, weakness that fails to be replenished, formation of pus that fails to be drained, and corruption leading to failure in nourishment. If the abscesses are due to damp-heat obstruction, the use of Huanglian Jiedu San and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang is advised to eliminate dampness and toxins, bolster the spleen and lungs, and nourish the water of the kidneys.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Effect of Wheat Meal Stone Plaster</p>
<p>Li said: Wheat meal stone plaster treats carbuncles and abscesses with remarkable efficacy, though sadly few in the world know of its virtues. There was a patient whose pus did not rupture; after applying a toxic medicine, the condition worsened, and the poison spread to the throat and knees, resulting in an untreatable state. I used this plaster, and in one night it ruptured. Whenever there is pus in an abscess, the poison begins to resolve. If there is no rupture, this plaster must be applied. Thus, I record it to allow for careful selection and adjustment, aiming for complete success.</p>
<p>Moreover, in cases where the symptoms belong to the yang and the qi and blood are not harmed, applying this plaster will surely lead to healing. However, for cases that belong to the yin and show deficiency in qi and blood, one must carefully assess the cause and adjust the internal condition accordingly. Generally, the formation of sores and ulcers arises from improper gastric qi; the rupture of sores and ulcers stems from the corruption of gastric qi; the healing of sores and ulcers depends on the nourishment of gastric qi. I have treated initial swellings by dispersing them; those on the verge of producing pus by facilitating their decay; pus that has formed but not ruptured by encouraging its opening; and once pus has ruptured by promoting its healing. Mr. Dongyuan stated that gastric qi is the source of vitality and the foundation of the human body. Mr. Danxi also remarked that treating sores should involve strengthening the stomach to bolster qi, ensuring the foundation is solid.

<p>Li stated: Recently, there have been several cases of back abscess, either starting with cold followed by heat, or the other way around, or occurring on consecutive days or intermittently. These patients must experience vomiting, phlegm, and profuse sweating before their condition improves, and both Chai Hu and Heng Shan were ineffective. I believe this is due to an imbalance in the spleen&#39;s energy, compounded by the invasion of cold and excessive phlegm. Therefore, I first used Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San, followed by Pái Nóng Nèi Tuō San and Mu Xiang Tang, and within three days, they recovered. </p>
<p>If, after the external evil has been expelled, symptoms persist, one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang to nourish the spleen and stomach.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Fever Associated with Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Li said: When there is a fever affecting the back, it invariably arises from kidney deficiency. It is essential to take the modified Eight Flavor Pill at the early hours of the morning. The previous discussion is indeed a guide for future generations and a lasting benefit. Fever along the back results from damp-heat in the kidney meridian, with deficient fire rising, leading to adverse symptoms. Unless one takes the modified Eight Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water and restrain heart fire, supplement the center and benefit Qi to generate transformation, it would be difficult to seek recovery. Qi Yuanzi stated: If there is extreme cold yet no heat, it signifies a lack of fire, and thus one should support the heart. If there is extreme heat yet no cold, it signifies a lack of water, and thus one should nourish the kidneys. Cold without cold means there is insufficient water; heat without heat means there is insufficient fire. Prolonged heat indicates a deficiency of the heart; prolonged cold indicates a lack of water. I suggest that for lack of fire, one should use the Eight Flavor Pill to nourish the heart; for lack of water, one should use the Six Flavor Pill to nourish the kidneys. Furthermore, according to &quot;Zhouhou,&quot; if you cut off one end of a winter melon and place it over a sore, when it rots, cut it again and apply it. If there is severe swelling and pain with the pathogen on the surface, this method is most suitable to disperse heat and draw out toxins to resolve stagnation. If swelling and pain are accompanied by thirst and constipation, indicating that the pathogen is internal, one must assist with Huang Lian Decoction, to open and benefit the organs for detoxification; if located in the meridians, it is advisable to use Tuo Li Rong Wei Decoction to regulate Qi and blood, which is excellent.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Three Causes of Separation</p>
<p>Chen Wuze states: Those who develop back pain are influenced by three causes. The discussion states: boils, sores, and tuberculosis, regardless of whether they are due to deficiency or excess, cold or heat, all arise from stagnant qi. The classic text also states: qi accumulates in the meridians, thickening with blood, causing blockage that leads to boils and sores. It does not mention that heat must be present later for boils to form; rather, this is a result of internal causes such as pent-up emotions—joy, anger, worry, or thought.</p>
<p>When the body has heat and is struck by wind and cold, the blood vessels become congested and fail to flow, resulting in heat accumulation and blockage. There are also cases where yin deficiency and yang qi converge, causing cold to transform into heat, leading to decay of flesh into pus; this, too, arises from external causes of cold, heat, wind, or dampness.</p>
<p>Moreover, ingesting certain elixirs or consuming overly heated wine, using thick bedding, or exhausting oneself sexually—all of these lead to empty yang and disrupted qi’s adjustment. Hence, it is understood that the three causes are comprehensive. However, while the three causes are classified, the variations in the pathogens that affect skin, surface, or internal conditions are not distinctly outlined, therefore the treatment methods cannot be thoroughly detailed.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Overview of Back Sores</h3>
<p>Back sores are associated with the Governing Meridian and the Bladder Channel. They can arise from various causes: excess heat due to Yin deficiency, consumption of rich foods and alcohol, emotional distress, or heat toxins from minerals. </p>
<p>If there is significant swelling, redness, and pain, with a strong and rapid pulse, this indicates heat toxin, which is easier to treat. If there is diffuse swelling with slight pain, a dark color, and despite a rapid pulse it feels weak, this indicates Yin deficiency, which is more difficult to treat. If there is no swelling or pain, or diffuse swelling with a dark color and a weak, thin pulse, this indicates severe Yang deficiency and is particularly hard to treat.</p>
<p>For individuals with back sores, it is difficult to conceal the symptoms. Use about ten douts of mung bean and make a large bag to hide it, which will naturally cool the heart and calm the body. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain, accompanied by chills and fever, while appetite remains unchanged, this indicates excess of both form and spirit. Start with the Immortal Vitality Decoction, followed by the Elimination of Toxins Powder for resolution.</p>
<p>For headache and stiffness as a surface condition, take one or two doses of Ginseng Poison-Dispelling Powder first. For cramping pain, use Honeysuckle Powder or Sophora Flower Wine, or the effective Elimination of Toxins Powder.</p>
<p>For pain and hard swelling with a solid pulse, employ cooling drinks, Immortal Vitality Decoction, or Bitter Root Pills. If there is hard swelling with a wooden feeling, pain, heat, restlessness, cold drinks causing constipation, and a deep solid pulse, then use the Internal Clearing Huanglian Decoction or a cooling drink.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<p>For those who suffer from waist and back pain due to prolonged reading or sitting in games, it is associated with deficiency. The main treatment is Shenqi Decoction, along with Bawei Decoction. Overweight individuals with phlegm, particularly older ones who experience pain alleviated by hitting, are attributed to phlegm and deficiency; they should focus on eliminating dampness and phlegm while also tonifying the spleen and kidneys. </p>
<p>After excessive drinking or eating, if pain occurs with a desire to be hit, it is due to the spleen&#39;s inability to transport, leading to damp heat. One should regulate their diet. Slim individuals often suffer from blood deficiency and Yin deficiency, and they cannot indulge in alcohol or rich foods as a result. Nourishing blood and clearing heat can be achieved with Siwu Decoction, Jiuqing (Wine with Scutellaria), Lian, and paeonia. </p>
<p>For back pain, one should add Qianghuo and Fangfeng to guide treatment along the meridians; overweight individuals should minimize the use of Fuzi. Individuals with a history of deficiency, as well as those recovering from illness or childbirth, may experience heart pain or radiating pain to the sides of the chest or back. This is due to the reversal of vital energy; one must guide it back to the source and should not further relax or press, as it will lead to increased pain. </p>
<p>Those who sweat excessively often suffer from this condition and should focus on warm supplementation. Being bound by pain prevents effective treatment; sweat is the liquid of the heart, and if excessive, it depletes heart fluid and leads to insufficient Yang energy, resulting in pain.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Cold-Induced Fever</h3>
<p><strong>Aversion to Cold</strong></p>
<p>The back corresponds to Yang, and the abdomen corresponds to Yin. When there is an aversion to cold in the back, it indicates Yang deficiency. When Yang is insufficient, Yin energy becomes excessive; this results in harmony in the mouth. When Yang energy sinks inward, the mouth becomes dry. Aconite and White Tiger Decoction should be examined in detail. When there is harmony in the mouth, but an aversion to cold in the back, it belongs to the Lesser Yin; Aconite Decoction and moxibustion at Qihai (Sea of Qi) is appropriate. When Yang energy sinks inward, leading to a dry mouth and an aversion to cold in the back, White Tiger Decoction is indicated.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Clinical Guidelines</h3>
<p><strong>Severe Pain</strong></p>
<p>When there is pain in the spine, stiffness in the neck, and the lower back feels broken, with a feeling of pulling in the neck and sudden head pain, it indicates blockage in the Foot Taiyang channel; Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction is the principal remedy. If the pain is due to trauma from falling from a height, with stagnant blood in the Taiyang channel, resulting in unbearable pain in the lower back and spine, Diluolong Decoction is indicated. According to the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; a combination of wind and cold leading to sweating causes pain in the shoulders and back, along with frequent and insufficient urination; this suggests that wind-heat has invaded the lungs, severely obstructing lung qi. You should disperse the wind-heat to promote qi; Fangfeng Decoction is the main remedy. If cold and warm qi are insufficient to rest, and pain in the shoulders and back leads to loss of urination, you should supplement lung qi deficiency with ingredients such as Ginseng and Astragalus. This is self-evident.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heavenly Pillar Hair, Heart Opposite Hair, and Navel Opposite Hair</p>
<p>If one asks how many types of hair-related sores on the back there are, it is said: there are three types - upper, middle, and lower - all located in the spine and associated with the Governing Vessel. The upper hair is injured in the lungs, appearing below the Heavenly Pillar bone, known as Heavenly Pillar Hair. The middle hair is injured in the liver, referred to as Heart Opposite Hair. The lower hair is injured in the kidneys, known as Navel Opposite Hair. All are caused by accumulated heat and anger. Initially, they may feel like millet, or be itchy, or tense, or not painful, or very painful. At the first sensation, one may apply moxibustion nearby with garlic, or induce sweating, purging, or lifting, assessing their deficiency to implement treatment. For issues at the upper back, one should avoid using licorice due to the risk of leading to deficiency in the lower origin; this is especially important for the elderly and weak. However, the three types of hair on the back are critical areas, differing from others, and should be treated with caution. If there is slight pain or itching, prompt treatment is advisable. For life-saving decoctions, add Qianghuo, Zijingdan, Shengjindan, or Duomingdan. For those strong and robust, one can use one pill of Jindan or Baizhensan for purging. For the elderly and weak, use Huangqi and Muxiang San or Shiquan Dabu Tang for lifting.<br>Yin and Yang sores.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the back sore has burst and is purulent, regardless of winter or summer, it is advisable to use four or five layers of silk cloth, applying a medicinal plaster externally.

This method helps retain warmth within the sore, facilitating the process of decay. When cleaning the sore, prepare two bands for replacement, ensuring that the internal warmth is maintained.</p>

<p>In a case of Shaoyin disease lasting one or two days, if the mouth feels comfortable but there is a sensation of chills in the back, one should use moxibustion and Fuzi soup to treat both internally and externally. If the mouth feels comfortable and neither dry nor thirsty, it indicates no internal pathological evidence. The back is governed by the Governor Vessel, which oversees the rising yang energies; if there is no chill elsewhere but solely in the back, it is evident that there is an abnormality of yang deficiency and the intrusion of yin pathogens. Therefore, both external moxibustion and internal warming should be combined, with the goal of eliminating yin and restoring yang. Those who lack understanding may believe that if the illness has only lasted one or two days and the external symptoms are mild, there is no need for such urgency. However, Zhang Zhongjing highlighted that in just one or two days, signs of yang deficiency and excess yin might already manifest, necessitating early treatment of acute illnesses. Waiting until the third or fourth day will result in a condition that becomes extremely severe and difficult to reverse, rendering it untreatable.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart pains through the back, and the back pains through the heart; this is the chilling energy that reverses upward and obstructs, accumulating between the chest and back meridians, leading to interlinked pain, disrupting the flow of qi and blood, and disturbing its boundaries. If one uses herbs to disperse the qi, it will only intensify the pain and may become perilous. Zhang Zhongjing used the Wutou and Chishizhi pills, incorporating Sichuan pepper and Wutou for their spiciness to disperse the yin evil. Yet, fearing that the chaotic energy in the chest and back would be hard to settle, he included dried ginger and Chishizhi in the warm medicines to fill the obstructed qi paths, allowing the qi in the chest and back to flow freely, preventing mutual interference, thus resolving the ailment. This embodies the essence of transforming stone to mend the heavens. Today, people recognize the methods of warming qi, tonifying qi, moving qi, and dispersing qi, as well as knowing how to clear obstructed paths of evil qi to enable the yin and yang energies of the chest and back to work harmoniously.</p>
<p>As for the pain in the spine, it arises from the depletion of kidney water, which fails to nourish the brain; thus, the pathway of the river cart becomes dry and hard to traverse, leading to pain. Such symptoms cannot be resolved with just one or two doses; it requires prolonged use of tonifying herbs to nourish yin and significantly taking tonics to replenish water for noticeable effect. The formula includes Huangqi and Shudi each one tael, Shanzhuyu and Mai MenDong each four qian, Beiwuweizi one qian, Baizhu five qian, Fangfeng five fen, and Fuling three qian, with Fuzhu one fen, boiled in water for oral administration.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this prescription, to tonify Qi, there are Astragalus and Atractylodes; to nourish the essence, there are prepared Rehmannia and Chinese Wolfberry; to dispel dampness, there is Poria; to expel wind, there is Siler; to guide the efficacy, there is Aconite; and there is also Ophiopogon to nourish the source of kidney water. Naturally, when Metal is strong, it produces Water; when Water is sufficient, the path of the river cart will not be dry. If it is not dry, then Metal will be moistened and bones nourished, so why suffer from pain? If there is no pain, then why is the back not straight? Yet, this prescription will not show results overnight; it requires prolonged use to be effective.</p>
<p>For someone suffering from back pain, people might think it is a heart issue, but in reality, it is due to the disruption of the bladder&#39;s Qi. Consequently, the upper body is obstructed, resulting in pain. The method here should clear the fire of the bladder to alleviate the pain in the back. The bladder is the organ associated with the kidneys; when the kidneys are deficient, the bladder is also weak. The spine acts as the pathway of the river cart, with the bladder operating through the kidney&#39;s channel, hence the discomfort in the back.</p>
<p>The prescription includes one tael of prepared Rehmannia, three fen of cinnamon, three qian each of Plantago seed and Alisma, and five qian each of Job&#39;s tears, Poria, and Euryale seed, decocted in water to take as two doses. This allows for the large passage of the bladder&#39;s water route, and the back pain will also subside. Prepared Rehmannia is the supreme agent for tonifying the kidneys, and with sufficient kidneys, the bladder&#39;s Qi will also be strong. Moreover, with Poria, Plantago, and Job&#39;s tears to help drain the water, and cinnamon to guide the various herbs to the bladder to unblock its Qi, naturally the fluids will flow and the fire will disperse, resolving any stagnation. What issue would remain? This is why the treatment is effective.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Crack Revealing Snake Lice</strong></p>
<p>If a person suddenly experiences pain in their back, a crack opens, and a snake about two feet long jumps out, it is very good at leaping. I have personally treated this and confirmed the symptoms: there must first be severe pain in the spine without swelling; if it lasts long, swelling will occur, and a snake approximately one foot long will grow, seemingly standing upright on the spine. I then lightly cut the skin with a knife, and the snake jumps out, startling the person immensely. I treated this with one tael of ginseng, three qian each of pinellia and rhizoma arisaema, and one qian of aconite; it suddenly revived. A flesh-repairing powder was applied to the affected area, and it healed.</p>
<p>If a person has a crack in the spine from which over a thousand lice emerge, this is due to wind in the kidneys being blown by yang energy, leading to the unnoticed rupture and appearance of lice. The prescription uses three taels each of cooked rehmannia and cornus fruit, one tael of eucommia, five qian of white atractylodes, one qian of twining vine, and three qian of equal-leaved sweet herb; two doses for the crack will completely kill the lice.</p>
<p>There is also another recipe using three seeds of castor bean, ground into a paste, and three red dates, pounded into balls the size of a marble, burned and then smoked on clothes; this will kill the lice and heal the crack. This is indeed an extraordinary recipe, truly inconceivable. Castor seeds can kill lice; once the lice are gone and the wind exits, the crack will naturally close.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

Gradually add them; if added suddenly, the oil will float and be foamy—be cautious! Once the medicine turns black, filter out the residue and place it in an oil container. This medicine must be filtered using silk cotton and linen cloth for precise refinement. </p>
<p>Next, put it in a pot and slowly simmer until the oil achieves a state where water droplets do not disperse. In spring and summer, add one pound of clear pine resin, two ounces of oil, and stir in the willow branches. When warm, quickly add one ounce each of frankincense, dragon&#39;s blood, and myrrh, along with ten grams of musk. In early spring when it is still cold, add half an ounce of oil per pound; do the same in early autumn. </p>
<p>In cold winter months, use one pound of pine resin and four ounces of oil, mixing the fine herbs until they no longer stick to your hands. Pour into water; it will allow for a golden color. Soak for three days in water to remove toxic heat, and it&#39;s ready for use. For every pound of herbal oil, add one ounce of swan oil to help the ingredients penetrate the marrow. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Neibu San</strong>, also known as <strong>Muzhansi San</strong>, treats carbuncles and sores. For those that have not yet ulcerated, it promotes resolution; for those that do not resolve, it hastens ulceration and leads to recovery. </p>
<p>The ingredients are: <strong>Muzhansi</strong>, <strong>ginseng</strong>, <strong>dried ginger</strong> (also called dried rehmannia), <strong>cinnamon heart</strong>, <strong>Asarum</strong>, <strong>magnolia bark</strong>, <strong>bitter herb</strong>, <strong>Siler</strong> (or <strong>Fangfeng</strong>), <strong>pollen</strong>, <strong>Platycodon</strong>, and <strong>honey-fried licorice</strong>, each weighing one tael.</p>
<p>These eleven ingredients serve to treat internal blockages. Take with rice wine using a spoon, allowing the medicine to flow into the sore. If the carbuncles cannot break after moxibustion, or if they are already rotten, you may take this medicine. For those not rotten, omit the bitter herb; for those that have begun to suppurate, include the bitter herb. Take the medicine seven to eight times a day and two to three times at night; more is better. </p>
<p>If the condition is in the lower body, the pus and blood will emerge, indicating intestinal carbuncles. For various internal diseases, simply taking this medicine allows one to feel its effectiveness; pain will cease. Regular use means omitting the bitter herb. It treats all kinds of sores, carbuncles, hemorrhoids; for women, it helps with milk fever that has already ulcerated for quicker recovery. </p>
<p>If physicians do not recognize this medicine, they have no treatment for carbuncles. If you first notice an unfavorable area on your back and feel thirsty, take it diligently. Once the medicine takes effect and thirst is quenched, it will resolve. If it is already rotten, take it day and night without stopping; the swelling will dissipate on its own. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To prepare the remedy, first grind the ingredients evenly and cover the affected area with a piece of blue silk.

<p><strong>Shen Yi Ointment</strong> – Treats all kinds of carbuncles and furuncles.</p>
<p>Take one liang of peeled and sliced apricot kernel, one liang of cleaned bee&#39;s nest, and the more bees, the better. Clean and dry one liang of snake’s skin washed in salt water. Take half a liang each of original root and astragalus, three fen of astragalus, and five liang of yellow lead, finely ground. The messy hair of a man, cleaned and dried, about the size of a chicken egg, uses one jin of real hemp oil.</p>
<p>For preparation: first, place the hemp oil in a silver mortar, mix it with the messy hair, and slowly simmer it over a gentle flame until the hair is charred and completely melted. When this happens, add in the apricot kernels and wait for them to change color. Then filter the oil through fine cotton to remove any residue. Next, put the strained oil back into the silver mortar and add the two herbs, original root and astragalus, simmering them over a low fire for one to two hours. Remove the mortar and place it on a cool hearth, waiting for about half an hour until the heat subsides. Then quickly add the cleaned bee&#39;s nest and snake’s skin, and stir with a willow branch while keeping the mortar over the fire, constantly stirring until it reaches a yellow-purple color. After filtering again through cotton, pour in the clean oil and rapidly mix in the yellow lead. Then return the mortar to the fire, stirring constantly over a low flame until the oil turns black. When droplets fall into water and form beads, the ointment is complete.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

If there is a concern that it may have been overheated and becomes too hard to use, add a little wax and mix in sesame oil, placing it in a ceramic container to steam over boiling water, stirring well while hot, and then store it. Once the ointment is completed, it is essential to place the ceramic container in a basin of clean water to draw out the harmful heat for a full day and rest for three days before it can be used. The process of preparing this ointment is very sensitive to the temperature; one must patiently monitor the heat carefully, as too strong a fire will cause the paste to overheat—this precaution is paramount!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of the Immortals</strong></p>
<p>To treat abscesses and all kinds of poisonous sores, preemptive use prevents toxins from entering the body. </p>
<p>Take one pound of true sesame oil, heat it in a silver vessel until it boils several times, then let it cool. </p>
<p>Next, take two bowls of wine and combine with five cups of oil. Consume it hot through the mouth, finishing it in one day; if slow, take it over several days. </p>
<p>Wu Anshi stated: &quot;My family has used this for three generations, and it has never failed.&quot; It is also said by hunters: &quot;If you are hit by a medicinal arrow, urgently take sesame oil, and the poison will dissipate.&quot; Zheng Xue argues that De Fu&#39;s repeated use of it has shown remarkable efficacy. </p>
<p>Sesame oil clears heat and toxins from the lower energizers and relieves gas stagnation in the large and small intestines. If sores begin to develop with toxins accumulating inside, or if constipation occurs, using it to facilitate detoxification is indeed a good method. However, if constipation is not present and there is excessive heat in the lower energizers, it may not be appropriate; one should examine the condition carefully before use.</p>

<p>Ingredients include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Prepared Aconite root, 3 taels</li>
<li>Ginger, 2 taels</li>
<li>South Star herb, 1 tael</li>
<li>White Angelica, 1 tael</li>
<li>Red Peony, 1 tael</li>
<li>Unheated Cinnamon, 0.5 taels</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind these into a fine powder and mix with hot wine for application. If the back sore results from Yin, and has been mistakenly treated with cold medicine, or if it originates from Yang but has been wrongly treated with cold medicine, the Yang can turn into Yin, leading to a rotten black condition on the back surrounding healthy flesh. Use Hong Bao Dan to stabilize it and apply this medicine in the center. In one night, the Yang energy will return, and the black will turn red and recover. Then, continue with the nourishing celestial ointment for the treatment. </p>
<p>If it does not work, and it tends to pus, add South Star herb and prepared Aconite to the nourishing mixture. If the Yang has returned and the black has turned red, but there remains a small area that is still black and rotten, it indicates dead blood. You may use substances like natron, alum, white clove, resin, and frankincense, mixed with saliva to form a paste. Apply it in a circle around the junction of black and red, and cover it with the nourishing ointment. By the next morning, the medicine will naturally come off, and the black flesh will appear cut. Cleanse the area with medicine and cover it with fresh meat to ensure recovery. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the past, methods such as using a chicken comb to cut and let blood drip onto the sore, applying vinegar-boiled male mugwort, using pig brain heat medicine as a poultice, and using divine lamp heat to cauterize were all treatments for yin sores. Although I have tried these, I have not seen significant results. However, when a yin sore does not develop, it is like the roots of a tree becoming rotten; cultivating the branches and leaves vigorously does not lead to growth. I have tried using medications according to principle, and it is true that out of ten cases, three or four can recover.</p>
<p>This is akin to agriculture: one must first loosen the soil, unblock the land veins, support the roots, and revive the yang energy. Each of these four steps is essential. Use astragalus, magnolia bark, Poria, and dried tangerine peel to unblock the upper part, and use light artemisia, angelica, chaff, and safflower to open the veins. For the roots, use ginseng, astragalus, goji berries, and mountain cornel to support them, while aconite, lemongrass, licorice, and angelica can revive the yang. If used in this way, as long as there is still a pulse of vitality within the roots, taking these can lead to recovery.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the hands and feet feel warm, the sores produce heat, gradually swelling occurs, and the pain returns, with dark colors indicating vitality and hardness indicating decay, while stomach energy is restored, then this is a sign of the efficacy of the medicine. It should manifest as auspicious within three doses. Additionally, externally, complementary methods to assist in reviving yang are to be combined, as this constitutes the great method for treating yin sores.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Using a beryllium needle, place it within an inch above the top of the sore, and create three openings in a pattern. Insert it to a shallow depth, approximately within the boundary of the tube. Connect the medicinal tube to the decoction and store it in a large ceramic bowl. In front of the patient, pour out the contents of the tube and, while hot, apply the open end of the tube to the sore, pressing it down firmly with your hand, allowing it to naturally adhere. After a while, when the tube has warmed, remove the wooden plug from the hole, and the tube should come off by itself. </p>
<p>Examine the contents poured out of the tube. If you see a mixture of pus and blood that is bright red and yellow in color, roughly equivalent to one or two cups, this indicates an active sore, which will definitely heal with treatment. However, if the contents are purely decomposed blood, with foul, dark purple-black characteristics, thin and watery without signs of pus, this indicates that the energy and blood are severely depleted inside, with non-vital muscle tissue, signifying a dead sore, which cannot be cured even with forceful treatment. </p>
<p>This method is a family tradition and has been verified many times. For sores that easily rupture and produce pus, this method should not be used, as it would harm the energy and blood. It can only be applied to stagnant sores, ideally those that are firm, don’t rupture, and don’t produce pus about fifteen days prior. This method has the potential to restore vitality, and it is essential for practitioners of medicine to know it.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

<p>For treating back sores, Mica stone powder is very good; it is a secret recipe from the hermit Lü Zihua of Mount Zhongyue. Take Mica stone, which varies in size - some are like fists, some like goose eggs, others like cakes, generally resembling a gathered mass. The stone has small grains that appear like beans or rice, and is either yellow or white; it can be found among the gravelly stones in streams. Crush the stone into pieces the size of chess pieces, then heat it in charcoal until it glows red. Soak it in rice vinegar for ten times, then grind it into a fine powder. Place it in a mortar and grind further for five to seven days until it reaches a very fine texture, amounting to four ounces; take one set of deer antlers, preferably fresh with the brain bone intact; those that have shed are not usable. Cut them into two or three-inch pieces, char them until the smoke stops, then grind into a fine powder, amounting to two ounces; take two ounces of white peony root, grind it into powder, and boil in three-year-old rice vinegar inside a silver vessel, bringing it to a boil; then add the other powdered ingredients while stirring continuously with a bamboo branch. Cook for one or two hours until the desired consistency is achieved, then cool in a basin, covering it with paper to keep out dust. When using, apply with a goose feather over the swelling and the surrounding areas that are red, leaving an area the size of a coin to allow for air escape.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is pus, it can be dissipated within; if it forms a head, it should be pressed small; if it has burst, the pus should be expelled like rushing water. If the illness has lasted long and the flesh is rotting away, exposing the tendons and bones, then apply fine cloth to cover it, changing it when dry, with the wound gradually closing day by day. However, if it has sunk into a cavity, it will not heal. For those that have burst, first wash away the pus and blood with pig’s hoof broth, then dry the area with cloth before applying medication. It is crucial to avoid touching the tender flesh with hands and do not blow air from the mouth onto it. Also, avoid contact with the scent of armpits, menstruating women, and pregnant individuals; these are to be avoided in conjunction with medication. Initially, wash and change once a day; after ten days, change every two days. The medication must be extremely fine to be effective. If not finely ground, application will cause extreme pain. This method has been noted in Sun Zhenren&#39;s &quot;Qianjin&quot; and is comprehensive in detail. Additionally, during the Northern Qi era, Ma Siming treated Yang Zunyan&#39;s back sore by taking coarse yellow stone, about the size of an egg, heating it strong fire until red, immersing it in strong vinegar, allowing impurities to fall into the vinegar, then heating and steeping it until finished. The resulting particles should be sun-dried, ground to an extremely fine powder, mixed with vinegar, and applied, leading to immediate healing. Liu Yuxi&#39;s &quot;Chuanxin Fang&quot; referred to it as the stone refining method, validated for treating swellings and sores.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Malignant sores on the back: On the Double Ninth Festival, gather one hundred old eggplants, remove stems, cut into four pieces. Crush twelve taels of saltpeter. In a dry container, first layer with eggplant, then add a layer of saltpeter like this until used up. Seal with several layers of paper, place in a clean location, and cover with new bricks to avoid contact with ground moisture. After the first month, take it out, remove two layers of paper, and expose to sunlight at noon. Do this daily until two or three months pass; the eggplant will decay. Tilt the bottle to pour out and filter out the residue, transferring the liquid into a new container. Use fine cotton to absorb the end and continue exposing it to sun until it forms a paste, which is then ready for use. Mix half a spoon with wine and drink on an empty stomach twice a day. Also apply the paste around the sore, and it will feel cold like ice; when the sore dries, it will heal. If there is a root in the skin and pores, it can also be resolved internally. If the paste dries and hardens, use rice wine to dissolve it for application.</strong></p>

In the case of lung heat illness, the heat leads to wheezing and coughing, causing pain that radiates through the chest and back, preventing deep sighing, accompanied by severe headaches, sweating accompanied by chills, and when the heat is intense, it can lead to death.

All these points are three inches away from the spine. To verify these points, you should press on them; if it hurts, then it is indeed their point. Moxa can be used, but needles should not. If there is excess Qi, reduce it; if deficient, then tonify it. When using fire for tonification, do not blow on the flames; it should extinguish by itself.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The diaphragm, the border of the spine, and the vital bones govern the pain from cold in the back, causing stiffness that makes it difficult to bend or look up. The fish region governs the numbness that spreads across the chest and back, making it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>The channel and hill ruins relate to acute sensations in the chest and back, with a feeling of fullness in the chest. All occurrences of back issues are caused by consuming the five-stone cold food and Shengsheng powder; there are also those who suffer by merely taking bellflower. Additionally, some develop back issues despite not having taken anything throughout their lives. This is noted in the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text, volume twenty-two as a remedy. These are cases from previous generations who consumed such.</p>
<p>The condition commonly begins between the shoulder blades, initially resembling the size of a grain of millet, accompanied by either pain or itchiness while appearing red. At first, people do not regard it as serious, but over ten days it may grow larger, potentially leading to death. At its worst, it can extend three inches wide and one inch high, with dozens of sores. Pressing on it will release pus from all the holes, and the voice may be lost.</p>
<p>Therefore, for maintenance of health, when one feels an unusual itch or pain in the back, it is urgent to take pure earth, mix it with water to make a paste, and form into cakes that are two-finger thick and one and a half inches wide. Use coarse moxa to create sticks, and apply them to the sore where the mud cake is placed. Change the cake with each stick. When the sore is the size of a grain of millet, seven cakes will suffice for healing. If it is the size of a catalpa seed, use seven times seven sticks for treatment. If it is the size of a coin, treatment is not limited by the number of sticks used both day and night. Also, take the Five Spice Lonicera and Iron Juice to help combat the condition for healing.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Another method: For the condition of back boils that have not developed into large pus accumulations, one can apply cold water to shoot at them, soak stones to cool and press them against the boils, continuously day and night without stopping, until healing occurs. This ailment is sensitive to face, wine, and five pungent flavors. Sometimes boils arise on both shoulders. </p>
<p>In general, when swelling appears between the shoulder blades, the head becomes white like millet, with the edges connected, and the swelling is red and black, causing confusion, it is called back boils. One should avoid rooms, meat, and garlic. If not treated with moxibustion, it may lead to severe internal consequences. If using moxibustion, it should be applied to the sore vigorously, with seven or eight hundred vigorous touches. Some who are unknowledgeable mistakenly treat it with mixed methods, which can lead to death.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Medical Essentials&quot;: There are two methods for acupuncture and moxibustion for back pain: </p>
<p>First, treat the lungs. The scriptures state that lung disease can cause coughing and shortness of breath, with pain in the shoulders and back, and sweating occurs. Treat along the channels of the Taiyin foot and the Yangming hand; if there is excessive energy, shoulder and back pain occurs; if there is wind, cold, and sweat, pain from lack of energy may feel cold, with insufficient breath, viewing the conditions of excess and deficiency is vital.</p>
<p>Second, treat the kidneys. The scriptures state that if there is evil in the kidneys, it can cause pain in the shoulder, back, and neck, sometimes with dizziness. Treat at the Yongquan and Kunlun points, and if there is blood, address it thoroughly.</p>
<p>For shoulder and back pain affecting the scapula: focus on the scapular seam, below the shoulder blade, directly to the tip of the armpit, taking two and a half inches, with a draining technique followed by absorption; for the cervical spine, two and a half inches, perform eight drains and absorptions.</p>
<p>For shoulder and scapular pain, treat at the Kunlun, Xuanzhong, and Jianjing points.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Shoulder and back pain, along with pain in the neck and armpit that radiates to the chest, can be treated by taking one point from the Yongquan (Kidney 1) and the treatment is particularly effective when blood is drawn. For pain in the front armpit, puncture one inch into the area. </p>
<p>Another method: locate the Qi She (Spleen 6) five tenths (0.5) and moxibustion at Tianliao (BL 33); also take one and a half inches from Qu Pool (LI 11) and five tenths (0.5) from Tianjing (TH 5). </p>
<p>For shoulder and back pain, the heart of treatment is Sanli (ST 36). </p>
<p>For treating spine pain and stiffness, there are three methods: First, targeting the Du Meridian. The text states: the branch of the Du Meridian is called Changqiang and passes through the Yang channel, indeed addressing stiffness in the spine. </p>
<p>Second, take the Foot Yangming (ST 36). The text mentions: when pain obstructs the spine and culminates at the top, the head feels heavy, vision is unclear, and there’s stiffness in the lower back, it can be treated by taking the blood vessels in the popliteal fossa of the Foot Yangming channel. </p>
<p>Third, target the Small Intestine. The text states: when the lower abdomen constrains the testicles, it pulls the lower back upwards and affects the heart due to an evil present in the Small Intestine. Treat by dispersing it at the Huangyuan (BL 20), and puncture points beneath Taiyin (SP 3) and Jueyin (PC 6) to eliminate it.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is pain in the spine and waist, acupuncture should be applied at the point between the mouth and the center, inserting the needle three lines deep, slightly upward, but draining without supplementing, leaving it in for three breaths.

<p>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases&quot; states: The effective moxibustion with mulberry branches treats the condition of back pain not resolving, or bruised flesh that does not break open. This indicates weak Yang energy. Use mulberry branches to light a fire, extinguish the flame, and apply the heat to the affected area for a while, three to five times a day, to assist with the swelling&#39;s resolution. If rotten flesh has already cleared and new flesh is slow to grow, it is advisable to use moxibustion around the area. This method is also appropriate for chronic yin sores and scrofula that do not heal. Generally, if the condition has not ruptured, it helps resolve heat toxins, alleviates pain, and reduces swelling; if it has ruptured, then it reinforces Yang energy, disperses remaining toxins, and generates new flesh. For Yang-related swelling pain, which might feel heavier than a stone, initially using this method will expel toxic fluid, enabling internal resolution; for long-standing issues, even if it ruptures, it will remain shallow and cause no suffering. Unfortunately, patients are often unaware of this approach, and practitioners are reluctant to use it.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The garlic moxibustion method treats all poisonous sores that cause severe pain in the back, whether painful or numb. If it is painful, moxibustion should be applied until the pain stops; if it is not painful, apply until it hurts, and the poison will disperse with the heat. Fire opens and draws out the stagnant poison; this is a therapeutic method with the power to rejuvenate. Use peeled garlic, cut into slices as thick as coins, and place them on the sore. Then put moxa on top of the garlic and conduct moxibustion three times, replacing the garlic each time. If the sore is not yet formed, it will disappear; if it has formed, it will also reduce the severity and cause no harm. For larger sores, mash the garlic and spread it over the affected area, then place moxa on top and burn it until the garlic becomes ineffective, then replace it. If there is no pain or pus, or if it does not swell or is a hidden sore, it is especially advisable to apply moxibustion more frequently. If there is still no pain, no pus, and no swelling, it is not treatable. This indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood. Li states: For back abscesses that are swollen without a head, use damp paper to cover the swollen area, with just a small part dry to indicate the sore head.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

Cover it with moxibustion, using the garlic method to gauge the pain. If the previous case involved bone abscesses or the initial emergence of toxins in the buttocks and legs, a quick application of moxibustion often helps dissipate the toxins from within. If the toxins are severe, taking the Lifesaving Decoction will be even more effective. If one has a deficiency of qi and blood, one must focus on strengthening supplements. If a back abscess has ulcerated significantly and you want to check if it has penetrated the inner membrane, do not use the soap herb to induce sneezing. Instead, cover the affected area with paper and have the patient breathe intentionally; if the paper does not move, it has not penetrated. If you induce sneezing, you may disturb the inner membrane and cause penetration, so be very cautious! The &quot;Wushi Fang Lun&quot; states that the occurrence of boils and abscesses on the back has its reasons, as discussed in detail within the text. Whenever you first notice redness and swelling, start from the second depression along the spine and both sides, one and a half inches away from the body&#39;s center, called the hot viscera points, and moxibust each of these spots seven times.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

If garlic moxibustion is performed separately and regardless of the number of treatments, then the pathogen will have no place to reside, and the vital energy will not be harmed. In cases where sores appear on the head and neck, one should apply moxibustion to the ridges of the bamboo stick and at the point of Zusanli.</p>
<p>According to the Wu family: In treating boils and sores, if a lesion is painless, one must apply moxibustion to induce pain; if it is painful, one must apply moxibustion until it is painless. If pain occurs immediately during moxibustion, it indicates that the toxic heat is superficial; if it does not hurt, the toxicity is deeper. It is necessary to take internal medicine to eliminate toxins and expel pus, and apply external disinfectant medications. Generally, boils and sores should be painful but not excessively so. If there is a feeling of discomfort without pain, it is hard to treat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When the yang energy converges and is attacked by cold, it transforms into heat; if the heat becomes severe, the flesh will rot into pus. Most cases of sores occurring on the back are due to the consumption of metals and stones, and some are a result of past ingestion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One can take divine pills to counteract poison, which effectively removes the root of the poison.

When the sore becomes purulent, it is advisable to cauterize it: use a silver spatula about an inch wide and six inches long, heat it red hot, and frequently cauterize the affected area until the pus flows out, which is the desired effect. Generally speaking, abscesses and sores are more difficult to treat than various other ailments; without the subtle teachings passed down from heart to heart, how can they be easily cured? </p>
<p>In my humble opinion, if there is sufficient energy and blood, pus will form; one should quickly lance it, as it may not be healed with medication. However, if energy and blood are deficient and pus cannot flow out, or if pus flows but causes pain, it is essential to support the internal organs and nourish the stomach, to ensure a favorable outcome. </p>
<p>Mr. Wu stated: If one feels redness, itchiness, swelling, or pain between the shoulder blades, or sees white spots, one should moisten the area with saliva and avoid scratching.

A needle should be used to draw it out. For the elderly and weak, if one waits for it to erupt on its own, it often results in a lack of salvation; treatment must be careful. </p>
<p>Pain in the area may or may not be present and can be numb; this is due to excess evil qi, which should be treated with garlic moxibustion. For areas without pain, moxibustion should continue until pain arises, and for painful areas, it should continue until the pain subsides, dispersing the toxins with the heat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Eastern Q by Qi&quot; states: A relative of the clique was a magistrate in Linchuan, who, throughout his life, was frail and weak, often consuming substances like black (dragon), aconite, and vermilion. In his later years, a sore developed on his back, growing to the size of a fan. The doctors attributed it entirely to the poison from the vermilion and stone. They tried various detoxifying items, such as mulberry and bean powder, and sheep&#39;s blood, but with no effect. Someone recommended the old healer Zhu from the market, who was known as a sore specialist but was particularly precise in his diagnosis. After examining his pulse, he said: &quot;I do not wish to contradict what others may think, but this is indeed a case of extreme yin. According to my methods, he should take more of the fire-suppressing vermilion and Sanjian decoction; otherwise, it is beyond my knowledge.&quot; The doctors&#39; sons all seemed troubled, yet the patient was in a dire state, so they cautiously tried one or two small doses, while Zhu insisted on a larger dosage to be taken immediately. Three days later, they began applying an ointment, while continuing to take the vermilion and aconite without interruption. After more than half a month, the sore healed completely. In total, he took Sanjian decoction two hundred and fifty times, which can indeed be called exceptional skill. Hong Jinglu recorded that Kangzu suffered from a heart-related hemorrhoid and used &quot;Holy Benefit Formula&quot; to treat back pain, with deer antler and aconite, which led to improvement. Similarly, Guo, a physician from Fuzhou, used antler and aconite to treat leaking hemorrhoids, and such cases are numerous. Indeed, sores and abscesses manifest both yin and yang symptoms, and it is essential to determine this through pulse examination. However, contemporary surgeons often lack proficiency in pulse diagnosis, frequently relying on personal conjecture, which results in many errors; this is something that must be examined with precision.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; states: A person developed a boil on their back, and after more than a month of treatment, the condition worsened significantly. There was a man named Zhang who advised using moxa to burn the area, applying it up to one hundred and fifty times, stopping only when the pain was felt. The next day, when the black scabs were tweezed away, the pus was completely drained, and the flesh was all red and no longer painful. A medicinal plaster was then applied, changed daily, and during the changes, the black and rotten parts were trimmed. After more than a month, it healed completely.</p>
<p>The &quot;Chuang Yang Quan Shu&quot; states: A man aged sixty developed a back boil after the winter solstice. After five to seven days, the swelling extended about seven inches, and because the opening was delayed, it began to change. He felt the sore was as heavy as carrying a stone, burning like fire, and the pain was double the usual. The pulse was deep and rapid, and pressing on it revealed strength. This was a transformation due to excess heat from rich foods and the presence of severe pathogenic heat, which needed to be treated with cold medicine. It was a harsh winter month, and there was a caution against using cold medicine excessively. Thus, one might think of the Inner Canon and its guidance: when conditions are contrary to the season, one may still proceed according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a hunchback and a gradually shortening neck. When asked about the cause, he attributed it to eating drought-dwelling turtles. For treatment, purple shiso was boiled into a broth to wash the area, after which he applied tortoise urine. To obtain tortoise urine, one would place a tortoise in a vessel and shine a mirror on it, which would induce urination.</p>
<p>In another case, a man developed a lump on his back, feeling mentally exhausted and physically weak, with loss of appetite. A physician diagnosed it as a lice boil and recommended surgical removal. After cleansing with licorice soup and drying the area, he used an old wooden comb ground into ash, mixed it with sesame oil, and applied it, resulting in immediate healing.</p>
<p>According to &quot;The Teachings of the Scholar on Caring for Parents,&quot; there was a wealthy girl, over ten years old, who loved to eat purple cherries, consuming two to three pounds each time and repeating this every year for over a decade. One day, feeling feverish as if from labor, a practitioner examined her and found her pulse to be strong and forceful, predicting that she would eventually suffer from festering sores and toxic swelling, with heat rising to affect her eyes, leading to an excess of yang and depletion of yin. Her family was enraged and refused to accept detoxifying medicine. Within a year or two, she developed a boil on her back as large as a plate, causing unbearable pain. She recalled the practitioner’s words and repeatedly sought his help, apologizing. He used a golden needle to prick around the boil hundreds of times, extracting a bucket of blood over three treatments, gradually reducing the pain and swelling, with slight pus discharge. As a scab began to form, he advised her to take a tonic and internal herbal powder, leading to her recovery. She avoided certain foods for the rest of her life, but her vision remained dim, and she remained childless.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A man suddenly suffers from a sharp pain along the seam of his shoulder and back, extending from the shoulder across to the front of the chest and stopping at the side of the abdomen. The pain persists day and night, unbearable, with a pulse that is taut and rapid, showing a stronger left side than the right. The area of the back and shoulder relates to the small intestine meridian, while the chest and abdomen relate to the gallbladder meridian. This is certainly due to excessive thinking and worry harming the heart; although the organs themselves are not sick, the bowels are affected first. Therefore, the pain arises from the back and shoulder, stemming from indecision in thought, which eventually connects to the gallbladder, leading to pain in the chest and side. This is a manifestation of excessive heat from the small intestine attacking the gallbladder, where the offspring invade the mother, indicating a real pathogen. Upon inquiry, it was confirmed that the illness arose from unfulfilled plans. Administer four qian of ginseng and two qian of mutong, decocted into a broth with several doses of Longhui Pill, which resulted in recovery.</p>

A prescription of Ma Huang and Gui Zhi Decoction, along with wine, Huangbo, Shengfu, Gualouzi, Gan Caojie, Qianghuo, Qingpi, Ren Shen, Huangqin, Ban Xia, and Sheng Jiang is given, with six applications and gradual resolution of symptoms. This is a proper internal purging method, not the crucial Internal Purging Powder or medicines like Boswellia and Dolichos.

<p>A woman, aged sixty, has sores on her back. Her pulse is large and rapid, and she experiences chills and fever in the afternoon, with decreased appetite.

With Huangqi as the chief ingredient and Gan Cao, Danggui, and Ren Shen as assistants, the formula is aimed at genuinely nourishing the internal void while simultaneously purging.</p>
<p>A seventy-year-old man suffers from back sores larger than a foot. He has received several applications of Wuxiang and Shixuan, mixed with pus and bloody filth, experiencing vomiting and inability to eat for over ten days.

After three days of taking one and a half jin of the medicine, the urination pain stops, and appetite returns.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over sixty years old, who had a strong liking for wine and meat, developed an ulcer with pus and experienced vomiting and fever, likely due to the excessive consumption of inner tonics. The physician, addressing the vomiting, added cloves to the Jiahe powder to warm the stomach and promote the flow of qi. It was the hot month of July, and his pulse was strong and rapid. I noted that this pulse condition was particularly concerning in cases of ulceration; however, his vital energy was robust, so I recommended a mixture of ginseng paste and bamboo juice, consuming a total of fifteen pounds of medicine and over a hundred stalks of bamboo, which achieved stability. I said, “This illness is fortunately manageable. If he does not limit his diet, it will surely recur.” Still, he continued to eat richly. After a drunken episode in a water pool during summer, a year later, a soft lump the size of a cake appeared on his left side, which developed into an ulcer two years later. When I saw the pus and blood, his pulse was still strong and rapid, and he had vomiting with poor appetite. He decided to take the ginseng paste with bamboo juice again, consuming another hundred stalks, which brought him back to stability. Now at eighty years of age, he is as strong as before. This illness was due to the weakened blood and qi of old age; with just two doses of ginseng and bamboo juice, he recovered. If he had taken the inner tonics instead, I fear he would not have been as safe.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I treated my older brother&#39;s back sore, which had developed into a severe condition, and we were too poor to afford anything but to await death. The wound appeared dark and deep, suggesting an internal issue. Urgently, I prepared a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, and rhizoma atractylodis for three days, and washed it with a mugwort and angelica decoction. He was in a frail state, almost unable to support himself, but fortunately, he did not have a fever and could still consume food. Each day, I gave him a large bowl of dumplings. After using five jin of the medicinal salve and providing thirty bowls of meaty dumplings, the wound gradually healed, likely due to the nourishing properties of the meat and dumplings.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; states: In the winter of the year Wuy, I was stationed with the army in Chengwu County. There was a father of a merchant, over sixty years old, who developed a sore on his back just days after the winter solstice. Within five to seven days, the swelling reached about seven inches and was unbearable. The sore physician remarked that there was already pus and it could be lanced. The gentleman, fearing the procedure, did not comply. Three days later, the physician warned that not lancing it could lead to further complications. Eventually, he used a cauterizing needle to open the sore, allowing the pus to drain and relieving some pain. Because the opening was delayed, after two days, secondary symptoms arose, making him feel as if he was bearing a heavy stone, and he experienced intense heat and pain, with a rapid pulse. This was a transformation due to the accumulation of heat from rich foods. Given the strong heat of the evil energy, it was advisable to treat it with cooling remedies. The month was harsh and cold, and I had to be cautious about using cold treatments. I recalled the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which states that if there is a deficiency, one should counter it; while it may be contrary to the season, it could be appropriate to address the symptoms. Consulting with the sore physician, I swiftly prepared a cooling decoction, adding one tael and five qian of yellow lungwort for one dose. This resulted in bowel movements twice, and the pain decreased by seventy percent. The following day, I gave him the previous medicines again, and all symptoms were resolved. Over the course of the next month, he recuperated fully.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

After about twenty applications, the red halo receded. The patient felt no fear and thus made larger moxa, gradually increasing it to the size of a chicken&#39;s yolk. It took about forty applications before pain was felt, and upon examining the charred area, it had already exceeded an inch in size. This was because the moxa was applied slowly, and by then the flesh at the initial site had already decayed; the dead flesh had become stubborn, causing pain only when healthy flesh was reached. The surrounding area felt pain because the flesh was not yet decayed. The patient had not slept for six nights, but now could eat porridge and sleep soundly. By evening, the sore appeared as if covered by a steaming basket, protruding three or four inches, with countless small openings and a deep black color. The sudden protrusion indicated that the toxic gas was escaping and gathering; the countless small openings suggested that the toxins had not yet fully concentrated and were still attacking the skin; the deep black color revealed that both the skin and the flesh were decayed.

He developed a back pestilence with diffuse swelling; the central area was dark in color, with slight redness around the edges and mild pain. His pulse was floating and large, but thin when pressed. The left inch was short, while the right inch felt almost nonexistent. The swelling had not fully developed for over ten days. This ailment was due to deficient cold vital energy. In the morning, he was treated with ginseng, astragalus, ginger, cinnamon, angelica, atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, half summer, and honey-fried licorice to warm and supplement his yang. In the evening, he took a modified Eight Flavor Pill to nourish his liver and kidneys. After four doses, it festered; however, the pus was clear and watery, with night sweats and internal heat manifesting as evening fevers, along with a floating and rapid pulse. The treatment was switched to the Eight Treasures Decoction, which caused renewed fever and a rise in yang during the night—indicating kidney deficiency with rising fire. The modified Eight Flavor Pill was again prescribed, boiled and taken, leading to stability. </p>
<p>Additionally, through anger, liver fire was activated, leading to the sore bleeding about two cups; the left pulse was tense, while the right pulse was weak. This indicated that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen, preventing the liver from storing blood and the spleen from regulating blood flow. The Ten Complete Nutritional Pills, combined with the previous medicinals, were given in two doses, stopping the bleeding.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A Confucian scholar suffered from a back boil, which was swollen and extremely painful, a result of excessive heat and poison accumulating. He applied garlic as a moxibustion treatment, and the pain relieved; he then took a magical restorative drink, and the swelling subsided, eventually using a medicine to eliminate the pus and heal.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a back boil, where the necrotic tissue had festered but new tissue did not regenerate. This indicated a release of toxic energy and a deficiency in the spleen and stomach qi. He was treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Chuanxiong, Angelica, Wuweizi, and Astragalus, and gradually improved, eventually recovering fully with the Complete Nutritional Decoction.</p>
<p>Another man had a back boil with necrotic tissue and clear pus, yet no new flesh was forming. This indicated that the evil had been expelled but both qi and blood were deficient. He took the Complete Nutritional Decoction and improved greatly within a month.</p>
<p>A man had a painful back boil, swollen with redness extending over a foot wide, as if bearing a heavy stone. His condition was severe and required aggressive treatment, but his pulse was not suitable for such. Therefore, bloodletting was performed at the red area, yielding about a bowl of purple blood, and the swelling and pain suddenly receded. Further treatment with the Divine Power Powder and the magical restorative drink was applied in two doses, leading to bleeding and drainage from both the wound and the bloodletting site, which alleviated the issues. Generally, when the boils are severe, using aggressive medicines can deplete the vital energy in frail individuals, often causing a transformation of symptoms.</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar Zhou, residing in Lu, had long been repressed and developed a boil on his spine. His liver pulse was taut and strong, while his spleen pulse was superficial and large, and upon careful examination, weak. He was treated with the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction, adding Platycodon and Fritillaria, and a small amount of honeysuckle and angelica, which led to a sudden improvement in his liver pulse and a recovery of the spleen pulse. He then took the restorative drink twice, resulting in the pus draining and swelling reducing, though his liver pulse remained taut. Although the poison had been expelled, his stomach qi was still harmed, prompting the addition of Pinellia and Poria for recovery. The use of honeysuckle and angelica was not meant to treat the boils but to resolve the patient&#39;s doubts.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The autumn official Gao Zhuo Zhen suffered from a painful carbuncle on his back, which was dark in color, hard, and as heavy as carrying a stone, causing a dreadfully clouded spirit. His relative, Court Evaluator Zheng Sha Cun, requested to accompany him for treatment. Zheng said: When Zhuo Zhen first served in a certain county in Huguang, due to the perilous condition of a certain river, he made efforts to improve it with notable success, and the locals built an ancestral shrine for him. Those who crossed the river would pray and offer sacrifices there. Since Zhuo Zhen fell ill, they suspected the shrine was to blame for the misfortune. I disagreed, stating that his illness was due to weakened vital energy from cold and accumulated toxic heat. Thus, I applied a garlic paste to the afflicted area, and applied moxa more than twenty times; he felt uncertain; then I laid out garlic and performed moxa again, still without realization; ultimately, I applied meat for moxa, and only after a long time did I understand, and he finally felt pain upon further moxibustion. I then administered a decoction of ginseng and prepared a greatly nourishing potion for him, and he began to recover.</p>
<p>For Officer Cao Wenzhao, who had suffered from a back carbuncle for over half a month, the ulcer was like millet and numerous, with internal pain like stabbing, and his pulse had ceased. This indicated a deficiency of vital energy with toxins accumulating inside, thus moxibustion was essential. I proceeded to burn moxa twenty to thirty times and gave him a decoction of Six Gentlemen with added patchouli and angelica for several doses. The condition of the ulcer began to improve, and the internal pain abruptly disappeared, with the stomach pulse gradually returning. However, the color of the ulcer remained purple and the necrotic flesh had not ulcerated, indicating a deficiency of yang energy. I then burned mulberry branches on the afflicted area to disperse the toxins and replenish the yang energy. Continuing with the previous medication, I added ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and cinnamon. The color became red and the pus thickened, with the necrotic tissue gradually decomposing. He was healed within two months. When the pathogenic qi is dormant and the true qi is weak, it cannot arise; hence, moxibustion along with significant tonics is necessary. If one uses ordinary medicines and waits for it to rupture naturally, very few escape regret.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Confucian scholar, nearing sixty years of age, had a condition that began in mid-winter. He entered the room with a back sore that had turned black over a span of approximately five inches, with surrounding areas darkened for over a foot. His back was swollen and hard, feeling as if burdened by a stone. He experienced fever and thirst, and urinated frequently. His hearing was impaired, his spirit was muddled, and he exhibited a weak and fine pulse, with the right hand suffering the most. He had been constipated for twenty-seven days, consuming over a hundred bowls of food without any noticeable change in his abdomen. Everyone wanted to relieve him, but I remarked: &quot;What pleases me is this.&quot; </p>
<p>I urgently administered a large dose of Six Gentlemen&#39;s decoction, adding ginger, aconite, and cinnamon. The sore began to ache. Afterwards, I used the initial medicine on an empty stomach, in the afternoon, I administered Six-Flavor Pill with added ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria. I also applied two doses of Life-Saving Decoction, and a considerable amount of black blood was drawn out through acupuncture, with only a small amount of purulent discharge. His back immediately became lighter and softer, and his bowel movements normalized. </p>
<p>I had been away for four days, but when I returned, his spirit was again muddled, the sore had darkened and sunk further, with pus and water oozing. He could not eat, so I urgently provided equal measures of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, along with five qian of prepared aconite, and three qian each of ginger and cinnamon. After taking these, he asked for food and even two ducks. </p>
<p>From then on, I provided two doses of the previous medicine daily, leading to the eventual purging of rotten pus and his recovery.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

He experienced chills and feverish urgency, with a deep and solid pulse, indicating poison within.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man developed a back sore that didn&#39;t erupt, with a floating pulse that felt thin upon pressure. His blood and qi were both deficient, hence it couldn&#39;t erupt; thus, he required a strengthening medicine to recover.</p>
<p>In Zhu Yang Mountain, a governor, aged fifty-two, experienced a sore on his back near the heart, resembling millet, which grew larger over three days, with a root approximately five inches in diameter. It did not swell or hurt, nor was there fever or chills, and his pulse was weak and deep. I said: &quot;If it is real, it hurts; if it is empty, it itches. Without eruption or treatment, if it breaks down and does not close, it also needs no treatment.&quot; Therefore, I prescribed a strong supplement for yang qi, which was white and dull in color, yet the sore&#39;s condition remained the same, with fatigue, reduced appetite, and cloudy urination. I then prescribed several tonics for qi and blood, like ginger and cinnamon, yet the sore still did not erupt.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day, he became angry and suffered from vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously. I again administered a strong tonic, but the sore remained inactive. I retained the previous two prescriptions, as he was in a daze and couldn&#39;t take them. After being advised, he finally understood and took seven doses in succession. On the sixteenth day, the sore erupted, showing red and pale colors. On the nineteenth day, I gave him more than twenty doses of a strong tonic. Later, due to exertion, he sweated, felt dry in the mouth, and had a bloated sensation in the temples and the top of his head; this indicated deficiency in both blood and qi, with the liver and gallbladder fire inflamed upward. I used a formula to nourish the spleen and augment qi, adding gardenia and peony, and he quickly recovered. However, due to internal heat and restless sleep, his hands and feet often felt warm in the afternoons; I prescribed Xiaoyao Powder with added gardenia, which reduced the heat. I also administered Gui Pi Decoction, and the sore healed as well.

<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: Chen Mingqi, a provincial graduate from Jiangyin, lived in the capital and suffered from back abscesses. He was cured after taking a great tonifying remedy. The next day, he set up a banquet to express gratitude and spoke as usual. That evening, he received a letter from home that greatly upset him, causing anger and thirst; he ate a little pear. By night, he experienced multiple bouts of diarrhea. In the morning, he urged me to examine him, but his pulse had already faded, and he ultimately became unable to rise. Pears are diuretic; they promote the movement of fluids downward. Those with a weak, cold spleen and stomach or postpartum women should avoid them.</p>
<p>In the capital, Zheng Zhonghan suffered from back pain for half a month. He had over ten sores on his back, sized like chestnuts, swollen and hard, with roots as large as plates. His back felt heavy as if carrying stones. He underwent fifty cauterizations with garlic, after which his back felt lighter. However, feeling improved, he disregarded restrictions and after three days, it worsened significantly; the sores flared up again, causing pain. He took four doses of a life-saving remedy, with slight improvement; then, four doses of Xiangsha Liu Junzi Decoction, but his food intake decreased. He relied on his medical knowledge and took two doses of a toxin-clearing medicine, which further reduced his appetite, leading to excessive salivation, as if he were unaware; this was a sign of severe spleen deficiency. He used to take three qian each of Tori medicine, angelica, and astragalus but secretly removed most of them. Later, even after taking a strong tonic with ginger and cassia, it was still ineffective. Thus, he took one pound each of ginseng and astragalus, half a pound each of licorice and atractylodes, and one tael each of dried ginger, cassia, and prepared aconite to brew a paste in a jar, consuming it over three days. The salivation suddenly stopped, the corruption and sores healed, and his appetite returned. He used Tori medicine again for strengthening the spleen, and the necrotic tissue fell off, leading to full recovery.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the southern capital, a scholar named Ye Gong had a cousin with the surname Nie who suffered from a back issue. It was June, and the rotten flesh had already been removed, leaving a wound about an inch wide, red and inflamed. He had a fever, was unable to eat, and felt nauseous but couldn’t vomit. After taking ten Xuan San and other medications, he still couldn’t recover. Ye asked me to diagnose him.</p>
<p>Upon light examination of his pulse, it felt floating and rapid; upon deeper examination, it was weak and thin—signs of proper pulse after a rupture. However, the wound was open, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi; the nausea without vomiting indicated a weak spleen and stomach; the red and inflamed appearance showed signs of virtual fire. Nevertheless, he was still treatable.</p>
<p>I prescribed Shen Qi Da Bu Tang, adding wine-fried Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Wu Wei, Mai Men Dong, and a drink of children&#39;s urine. His appetite increased steadily, and muscles began to grow. After taking eight doses, the wound shrank to the size of a grain. However, influenced by others&#39; words, he took two doses of poison-reducing medicine, thinking it would eliminate residual toxins, but instead, his fever and delirium worsened; urgently, I administered the previous medicine again, and after more than twenty days, he finally recovered.</p>
<p>Later, he engaged in good deeds, staying awake for a whole day and night, which led to exhaustion and fever. He felt as if he was sleeping but was not; I then gave him two doses of the previous medication, which increased his fever and he could only drink hot soup.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the late autumn, Guan Zhenfu suffered from a back boil, which was dark and hard, causing no pain when touched. The pulse was deep and thin, and the limbs were cold. Urgently, he applied moxa with garlic, using over thirty sticks, but it did not hurt; he then used moxa about the size of millet in seven doses, applied directly to the flesh, and only then did he feel pain. He was given Six Gentlemen Decoction in two doses, with two qian of aconite in each dose, but there was no response; the next dose had an additional two qian of cinnamon, and then he began to respond.</p>
<p>Shi Wuxuan Lianbo was troubled by a back boil. He took internal medicine, a wind-dispersing formula, and applied cooling herbs externally. He sweated profusely without cessation, could not eat, did not sleep, and had a wound of a foot long that was dark and hard. Pressing it did not elicit pain, and his breath was faint; this indicated a loss of yang. The pulse was nearly nonexistent. He urgently applied garlic moxa for about one period, and the back felt lighter, with surrounding areas feeling no pain. There was an area of the back about six inches wide that had already died. He took a dose of fragrant sand Six Gentlemen Decoction, and the next day moxibustion was applied again. The dead blood in the painful area was released, prompting a need for needling. After my return, he was misled by another doctor and did not undergo needling; his blood coagulated again, leading to the application of a warming blood-activating medicine. The next day, guided by my advice, he underwent needling and expelled about two cups of black blood. They claimed that the pain in the back suddenly disappeared. Previously, he was given medicinals with ginger and cinnamon, which helped him sleep soundly. Upon awakening, his limbs felt slightly stronger, but he still lacked appetite, experienced sourness upon swallowing, and the wound was still painless. They believed this to be due to yin toxicity. I clarified that this was an extreme deficiency of qi and blood, with cold evil rampant within, and no yang nourishment present in the affected area, causing the flesh to die; it was not due to yin toxicity.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Once yang energy returns, the stomach qi will revive, the dead flesh will decay, and one can be free from worries. With the previous two doses of medicine, each supplemented with two qian of ginger, cinnamon, and fuzi, and slightly taken with rice soup, the spirit returns to normal, the affected area remains hot, and the pulse is slightly stronger; thus, yang energy has partially returned. On this day, another physician claimed that the abscess was a fire condition, and given the current heat of summer, applied cool medicines like hibiscus root, and administered two bowls of porridge, along with detoxifying medication, leading to the decay of dead flesh. I believe hibiscus is a cold and cool medicine, which offers no benefit to the spleen and stomach. Should one eat immediately? The detoxifying medicine is an astringent and dispersive agent; how does it nourish yang energy? The dead flesh decays immediately? This is due to the previous effects of cinnamon and fuzi, which restored the stomach qi, thus allowing food intake, with strong yang energy leading to the decay of dead flesh. If a person with deficient cold does not have warming spices to revive yang and instead uses cold, cooling, toxic-clearing agents, can they possibly survive? If they think fire pertains to the yang condition and, sensing internal heat, apply warming and replenishing agents, would this not lead to death rather than revival? They do not realize this is a treatment method that disregards timing in favor of pathological condition.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

I said: This is a sign of severe deficiency and toxicity. Even if tonics are used, they will not be effective in consolidating it. First, I administered two doses of the Vitality Decoction, which slightly strengthened the back; after two more doses, the sore became slightly red. When I used a significant tonic, the sore produced black blood resembling wine, followed by fresh blood and a little clear pus. I said: It can be seen that the deficiency of Qi and blood is extremely severe.

I said: In cases of sores, they should feel like hemp externally and like melon internally; toxicity is accumulating inside, which is not a minor issue.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to an inability to refuse the local customs, I endured more than twenty severe pangs before realizing the pain. After ten more pangs, my back began to feel somewhat relaxed. I took six gentlemen&#39;s decoction added with Astragalus, patchouli, angelica, Ephedra root, and floating wheat in two doses; my thirst stopped, and my sweating diminished, but the sores remained dark, hard, and unsightly. I then took warming, blood-moving medicines, and the sores began to appear; my thirst ceased, and sweating reduced, allowing the stagnant blood to disperse. After a long while, I began to sweat again, and my mouth became dry once more. After taking several doses, although the outer skin broke, the clear pus had not yet drained, and the internal pus seemed to seek another outlet; they applied medicine to surround it. I said: If the interior is deficient and the pus cannot break outwards, surrounding medicine forces the poison inward. By the twelfth day, the pulse was floating, and pressing it felt non-existent. I used the previous medicines twice more, adding ginger and cassia, which brought immediate comfort and sleep. After two more days, the pulse suddenly became weak. I administered the previous medicines again, adding seven parts of aconite, and gave two doses. The gentleman said: &quot;Now my back has begun to return to me.&quot; His body also felt strong, showing signs of life. However, since I mentioned earlier that it would be difficult to consolidate his condition, more treatment was required.

<p>Wang, having a back sore, was weak in primal qi. He started with medication to promote the interior but began to ulcerate after taking strong tonics.

I stated: this is a case of internal deficiency, not dysentery. Yet he still used detoxifying medicine for dysentery and died. After a great ulceration, having white pus in the stool, whether it stopped or led to dysentery, indicates a deficiency of stomach and intestines; urgent distress and heaviness indicate blood deficiency. If it were truly dysentery, cooling detoxifying medicines should not be used. Furthermore, Master Zhongjing states: for dysentery that does not resolve, one must warm it; in cases of acute abdominal pain with dysentery, one should rescue the interior, possibly using warming tonics such as Li Zhong Wan with Fu Zi. For significant pain, one should warm. Master Dongyuan treated dysentery with sinking primal qi and did not neglect to use warming tonics. However, if the pus from the ulcer has been oozing for a long time and the qi and blood are weakened, whether to avoid warming tonics is beyond my knowledge.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a></p></div>

He took two pills of Po Guan Dan and found relief; later, he was treated with four doses of honeysuckle powder, which cleared the pus, and further healed with detoxifying medicine.</p>
<p>A woman had a back sore with formed pus, causing bloating and discomfort. After being needled, she took detoxifying medicine and was cured. Generally, in cases of back ailments, although there may be fever and pain, the condition appears serious yet manageable if thirst is present and the pulse is strong. If eating well, there should be no significant issues. Once the pus is released, all symptoms will recede. </p>
<p>Often, pain arises when pus cannot escape; using cold medicines to attack it could worsen the situation. If pus is present, it should be needled promptly; once it is released, the pain will cease. If heat and toxins cause pain before the pus forms, detoxifying medicine should be used. There may also be instances of decay extending over a foot; if there are no severe symptoms, tonics will promote healing without causing harm.</p>
<p>However, caution is necessary if the swelling is low, not red, not causing pain, the pulse is weak, there is no desire to eat, swelling has not burst, decay is not present, pus is clear and excessive but not stopping, and muscle growth is absent—this indicates deficiency of vital energy and is difficult to treat; robust tonics are advisable. In cases where pus and blood have already been expelled, the swelling and pain may intensify, with foul-smelling pus, restlessness, cough, severe abdominal pain and thirst, excessive diarrhea, and painful urination—these are signs of severe illness and should not be treated.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A weak woman has a sore on her back; although the outer skin is rotten, the inner pus has not burst forth, causing swelling and pain, along with restlessness and fever. I suggested that it should be urgently opened; once the pus comes out, the poison would be resolved, the pain would stop, and all symptoms would recede. However, she did not follow this advice, waiting for several days while the pus remained unyielding, and she became more painful and exhausted. Even though I applied acupuncture, it ultimately could not bring relief, leading to her condition becoming critical.</p>

<p>A woman, who is generally weak, has a sore on her back that has not yet formed pus, with severe pain and fever. I believed she needed garlic moxibustion to draw out the poison and let it resolve on its own. Again, she did not follow this advice, and both her conditions became dire.</p>
<p>For cases I regularly treat, regardless of the lunar calendar, swelling and pain, whether mild or severe, but not ulcerated, I would apply moxibustion and observe the effects accordingly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is lack of appetite or unwillingness to eat due to a poor diet, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with Huoxiang, taking three to five doses in succession. Additionally, apply the Xionghuang Jiedu Powder to cleanse the affected area. Daily, use Wujin Ointment to apply on the sore. When a sore develops, take a paper twist, dip it in Wujin Ointment, and insert it into the sore. If there is pus trapped beneath a fatty film that cannot be expelled, or if there is swelling and pain, it is advisable to draw it out with a needle; if there are necrotic tissues obstructing, remove them. If the necrotic tissue is loose and decaying, wash it with pig&#39;s trotter soup. If the pus is thick or painful, and the diet is normal or if necrotic tissue is decaying slowly, take a combination of disinfectants and medications to promote the discharge of pus, while continuing to apply the previous ointment. If the necrotic tissue has separated from healthy tissue, it should be removed promptly. If the pus is neither thick nor thin and there is slight pain, with no appetite and slow decay of necrotic tissue, further moxa with mulberry wood should be done, along with medications to promote pus discharge. If the necrotic tissue is not decomposing, or if the pus is thin and clear with little pain, urgently take a potent tonic and also use mulberry wood moxibustion to invigorate and dispel stagnant toxins. Observe that when the ulcers are slightly serious but not yet purulent, avoid the use of garlic moxibustion; if the pus is not mature and is left to decay on its own, it often leads to dire consequences. Generally, those with strong qi and blood or mild toxicity may rely on herbal efficacy or natural decomposition. However, weak individuals with heat toxins internally obstructed will not benefit from acupuncture, leading to incomplete results. Yet, if there is already pus formed, it must be opened urgently. Otherwise, in severe cases, it will lead to perforation of internal organs and decay of tendons and bones; in milder cases, it will prolong the decay of healthy flesh, making recovery difficult.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had a back sore that did not erupt for over half a month; it did not produce pus, was very painful, and her pulse was weak. After applying moxibustion with garlic slices over twenty times, it stopped. She then took a resolving medicine, and the sore gradually softened, producing clear pus without the flesh decaying. With a combination of strong tonics and moxibustion from mulberry wood, the necrotic tissue was gradually dealt with, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>For those whose sores have not formed pus after one to five days and are painful, apply moxibustion until the pain subsides; if they are already painless, apply moxibustion until they ache. If there is no pain or just numbness, conduct moxibustion brightly to disperse any toxic energies. </p>
<p>If swelling is firm without pus, and there is slight pain or none at all, especially when the sore resembles millet, moxibustion is particularly effective. If after several days the color is only slightly red and there is no swelling or significant pain, it is advisable to apply more moxibustion without being restricted by the time frame, while also taking sweet and warming resolving medicines, and strictly avoiding cold and cooling substances. If there is stagnant blood that does not decay, apply moxibustion with mulberry wood as well. </p>
<p>If the pulse is rapid and hot with pain, it arises from yang, and can be treated. If the pulse is not rapid and has no pain, it arises from yin, and is difficult to treat. The absence of pain is particularly concerning and should not be viewed as an ordinary illness. This condition should not be entirely painless, nor should it be extremely painful. Those feeling troubled should not be treated. </p>
<p>In general, abscesses on the back, brain boils, severe swellings, detached sores, and foot problems are all caused by rich and heavy foods, excessive physical exertion, emotional disturbances, or the use of medicinals and essence-replenishing tonics, leading to deficiency of essence and weakness of qi. They do not arise solely from stagnation in the nourishing and protective systems. It is essential to apply moxibustion to draw out the poison, further identify the causes, and investigate the location of the pathogen within the organs to determine treatment based on deficiency and excess, ensuring there are no missteps.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a sore on his back, initially small like a grain, causing him distress, pain, thirst, and constipation; his pulse was rapid and strong, indicating that the poison resided in his organs. I believed it necessary to urgently drain it to eliminate the source, preventing the poison from invading further. He thought it was a minor issue and took ordinary medicine, but eventually, it deteriorated into a severe ulcer, leading to his demise.</p>
<p>An old woman suffered from sores on her back, initially three lumps, all small like grains, swollen, hard, and causing distress and agitation. By the sixth day, the lumps multiplied significantly; her pulse was large and, when pressed, felt deep and fine, with a blockage preventing treatment. Gradual treatment began, although both inside and outside were rotting, the pus could not be expelled due to the muscular barrier, leading to swelling and unbearable pain. I insisted that it needed to be opened, but she refused. Later, even though she tried to pierce it herself, the poison had already penetrated deep, and she also perished. Generally, the affliction of sores on the back, despite being called various names, fundamentally hinges on the dual principles of yin and yang. If one or two lumps arise, exhibiting swelling, redness, elevation, pain, and heat, they belong to the yang category and are easier to treat.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a lump initially appears like millet, not swollen or red, causing dull pain and irritability, great thirst and constipation, with mumbling or grinding of teeth, within four to five days the lump counts in numbers, its sores resemble a chestnut, taking on the shape of a lotus pod, hence it is called lotus pod hair; if it does not resolve over the days, pressing it releases blood, and by the eighth or ninth day or several days, the lump flattens, and everything contained within comes out, creating a unified clot, which, when removed, re-clots, forming a common sore that rots together, with purulent matter internally attacking, appearing dark purple, belonging to a type of abscess that is hard to treat. A pulse that is rapid and slippery is somewhat manageable, but a deep and thin pulse is particularly difficult. Such a severe condition can only be effectively treated with garlic moxibustion and the application of black ointment. For individuals with this condition presenting in the skin along the spine and thigh where a layer of muscle exists beneath, even if the outer skin breaks, the muscle is hard to rupture, causing internal pus to remain, leading to swelling and suffering, with qi and blood becoming weak, resulting in numerous changes in symptoms. If one waits for it to rupture on its own, it often leads to death. It must be opened up, along with draining the internal matter. Regular treatment of this condition, even with razor or scissors, often fails to remove it. This hard entity, waiting for it to self-rupture, could turn harmful.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over fifty years old suffered from a sore on his back, which was swollen and painful, with a purple color and the skin about to break. He found it hard to eat or sleep, feeling extremely fatigued. He used mulberry branches to cauterize the affected area, releasing black blood, then fell asleep. Upon waking, all symptoms seemed to disappear. After taking two doses of a life-restoring potion and cauterizing once more, pus and blood all came out; with two more doses, the swelling and pain greatly subsided; finally, after taking several doses of a detoxifying powder, it healed. </p>
<p>However, the sore was very severe, and strong medicine was advisable to attack it, but being old, his blood and energy were weak, especially since it appeared on the surface of the skin. If one focuses solely on attacking the poison, the stomach&#39;s energy is first harmed, ultimately worsening the conditions.</p>
<p>A woman with a sore on her back experienced heat and pain, and solely took medicines to reduce heat and expel toxins. After the sore burst, the condition worsened, causing agitation, coughing, and painful urination, all of which were bad symptoms. She refused treatment and ultimately died. Generally, when dealing with sores and ulcers, among five good conditions, if one or two good signs appear, treatment may be successful; but among seven bad conditions, if one or two bad signs show up, treatment becomes difficult. If bad signs appear in a weak condition, it is hopeless; if in a strong condition there are no bad signs, recovery may occur by itself. Although this condition is said to be attributed to fire, it invariably arises from yin deficiency. Thus, it is stated in the classics: when the governing vessel is deficient, it emerges from the brain; when the bladder meridian is deficient, it emerges from the back.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Governor Zhao suffered from a back sore, which was swollen and hard, with no moisture, the sore resembling millet. His pulse was strong and rapid, and when pressed, it felt hard. The text states that if the marrow is not depleted and the organs are not failing, it can be treated. However, if the swelling is hard and the color is dark, as tough as a cow&#39;s skin, and the pulse is still more rapid, then this indicates that the vital energy has already been exhausted; without treatment, death is inevitable.</p>
<p>Zhang Yiren, over sixty years old, suffered from a back issue for three days. The color of the flesh did not change, with the sore about the size of millet, and with increasing weight on his shoulders and back, along with symptoms of chills and fever, and a rapid pulse. Chen Liangfu remarked that externally it felt like hemp, but internally like melon. The Qi family noted a dislike for cold and a strong heat, indicating a deep-seated issue. Additionally, with the flesh color unchanged, it was suggested to be an internal problem. I prescribed two doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San and applied garlic moxibustion more than fifty times; the poison began to erupt, relieving some weight from the back. Then I used Tuo Li medicine to gradually promote ulceration. However, since his Qi and blood were extremely deficient, causing thirst, I used herbs like ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and cooked rehmannia, which also alleviated the thirst. He wished for a quick effect, applying herbal poultices directly to the sore, which allowed the toxic energy to re-enter, leading to his demise.</p>
<p>I have often seen elderly and weak individuals affected by this; if the sore does not rise or is as hard as a cow&#39;s skin, many do not survive before it ulcerates. Even those who do ulcerate but cannot nourish their Qi and blood would also die. Generally, when a sore first ulcers and the poison is strong, it is advisable to use a plaster to draw it out, followed by herbs like ginseng and astragalus to support healing. If one instead uses medicine to suppress it, causing the toxic energy to attack from within, recovery is surely impossible.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a></p></div>

After three days, it grew larger, with a root about five inches long. It was neither swollen nor painful, and she didn’t have chills or fever. I took her pulse, which was weak and deep. I said: when the pulse indicates illness but the body does not show symptoms, it is concerning. In a case of excess, there is pain; in deficiency, there is itching. This is what distinguishes yin and yang presentations. If it does not erupt, it will not be treated. If it erupts but does not heal, it will also not be treated. I then gave her a remedy to greatly replenish yang energy, which appeared pale and dull; the sore remained the same. By the twelfth day, upon checking her pulse again, it was still deep, the sore had not progressed, she felt fatigued, had a reduced appetite, and her urination was scanty. I then prescribed a remedy to greatly replenish qi and blood, adding ginger and cinnamon, yet the sore also did not progress. On the fifteenth day, due to anger, she experienced vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, so I had her take a dose of the restorative medicine, but the sore still did not improve. I left two more doses of medicine and left. The patient was in a daze and did not take the medicine. Some encouraged her, and she finally understood. Following the prescribed method, she took seven doses in succession. On the sixteenth day, the sore began to erupt and became red and light in color, with pus similarly appearing. On the nineteenth day, I arrived and was pleased to see: the sore had crossed the critical phase, but her vital energy was still waning, which remained concerning, so I continued with the great restorative medicine for over twenty doses. On May 11th, due to overexertion, the patient developed spontaneous sweating, a dry mouth, a stiff tongue, and swelling at both the temples and the crown. I was called upon again. Upon examination, I concluded: both qi and blood are deficient, and there is inflamed fire in the liver and gallbladder. I used a tonic formula to invigorate qi, adding gardenia and peony, and she promptly improved. However, she experienced internal heat, had difficulty sleeping, and her hands and feet felt warm intermittently, accompanied by chills and fever. I prescribed Xiao Yao San with additional gardenia, and the heat subsided. I then used Gui Pi Tang, and the sore finally healed. In total, the sore lasted forty-two days from onset to healing.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zheng Chao, a scholar of Zhonghan, suffered from a back ulcer accompanied by fever, phlegm, loss of appetite, muscle atrophy, and fresh bleeding from the sores. I said: &quot;This is due to deficiency in the spleen&#39;s energy, which cannot control the blood and return it to its source. The treatment should focus on tonifying the spleen and stomach.&quot; He did not believe this and opted for methods to detoxify and cool the blood. However, he soon experienced severe chills and vomiting, which led him to realize the truth of my words. He used the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added roasted ginger, Pinellia, and Poria for several doses, and all symptoms subsided. I then recommended the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction, and the wounds gradually healed. Later, due to increased food intake, he experienced diarrhea that turned into dysentery, which indicated a deficiency and cold in the spleen and stomach. Therefore, I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with the Four Divine Pills to stop the dysentery. Subsequently, he took the Six Gentlemen Decoction again, and his wounds healed completely.</p>

I then added Angelica, Ginseng, and Astragalus, leading to the complete decomposition of rotten flesh. After stopping the medicine and due to overexertion, he continued to feel feverish and thirsty, so I prescribed Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica, Angelica, roasted licorice, Chinese yam, Chinese sour jujube, Poria, Alisma, and cinnamon, which stabilized his condition.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhou Honggang, the prefect of the capital, had a back ulcer that did not suppurate, with a large and floating pulse, indicating a deficiency of yang qi and stagnation of evil qi. He was treated with Tori Powder, doubling the use of Ginseng and Astragalus. However, internal heat caused thirst, with a surging pulse; this was attributed to false fire. The treatment was adjusted to urgently add Cinnamon to the previous formula, resulting in a quick decline of symptoms; he continued with Tori Powder until recovery. To use cold medicine for heat toxins in such a case would be a mistake.</p>
<p>Wang Dedang from the Ministry of Justice initially had a back sore, exacerbated by overexertion and the use of medicinal formulas like Shixuan Powder, leading to internal heat with symptoms of panting and thirst, and a large, weak pulse. This indicated that his yang qi was injured and thus could not rise, sinking into the yin portion and causing internal heat. I treated him with a combination of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding wine-fried Peony and Mai Dong, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Zhang Kegong from the Upper Residence had a back ulcer. Both internal and external treatments were cold and dispelling toxins, resulting in widespread pain, desire to vomit, reduced appetite, evening heat, and fear of cold. I observed that the widespread pain indicated weak protective qi that could not nourish the flesh; the desire to vomit and reduced appetite illustrated a weak cold spleen and stomach that could not digest; internal heat and evening heat indicated a deficiency of yin blood, with yang qi sinking into the yin portion; fear of cold and aversion to chill showed the weakness of yang qi that could not protect the skin. All these issues stemmed from insufficient qi in the spleen and stomach. Thus, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and the symptoms gradually improved. I also utilized Shi Quan Da Bu Tang as the necrotic tissue began to break down and later used Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Chuanxiong and Angelica, resulting in rapid regrowth of muscle and eventual recovery.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Confucian scholar Zhou Liangfeng had long been troubled by internal accumulation, suffering from a sore on his back, with a taut and strong liver pulse, and a floating and large spleen pulse. Upon gentle examination, it was tender. I prescribed the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Platycodon and Fritillaria, and using a small amount of Honeysuckle and White Mulberry in two doses. The liver pulse improved significantly, and the spleen pulse became stronger. Then, I administered two doses of the Huó Mìng Decoction, leading to the pus exhausting and the swelling subsiding, but the liver pulse remained taut. Though the poison had been expelled, the stomach energy was still harmed, so I continued with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Poria and Pinellia, and he recovered.</p>
<p>As for Cai Dong, who suffered from a sore on his back, I used the Tuo Li medicine and it softened, but the sore had not fully closed. At that time, it was mid-winter, and he also had a cough. I said: &quot;The sore has not closed, indicating a deficiency in spleen energy; the cough persists, indicating a deficiency in lung energy. We must tonify the source.&quot; One day, while dining together, I noticed he avoided lamb. I stated: &quot;Tonifying can alleviate weakness, items like ginseng and lamb are best for nutrition.

This indicated that the kidney&#39;s water was depleted and he was nearing death from an excess of fire.

<p>In mid-summer, a man named Chai Fu from Jingzhao had similar back sores, displaying a dark color and slight swelling, with heat and agitation, excessive phlegm, and a full lower abdomen, his hands and feet were cold. The right pulse was floating and weak, while the two wrist pulses were thin. I said this was a sign of deficiency and cold.

But upon waiting, he observed that the surrounding black color was blood stagnation and applied more cold medicine, which was not the correct treatment. He then removed the old medicine and treated with hot medicine, which caused intense itching throughout the night. The next day, the color was bright red and the swelling subsided; however, dozens of small holes appeared like a honeycomb. One day, he then felt nauseous and saw one person&#39;s head as if it were two. Diagnosing himself, he said this was a sign of extreme deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, having given birth late, took a magical elixir for gathering treasures and developed a boil on her back, which became very critical. Her pulse was weak and large, so she urgently administered over a hundred doses of a modified Si Wu Decoction to nourish her yin blood. Fortunately, her constitution was robust, making it easier to consolidate her condition.</p>
<p>In the household of Wu Xiang Shi Bangzhi, during midsummer, a patient suffered from a boil on his back, with necrotic tissue that would not discharge. He had high fever and severe pain, felt nauseous with little appetite, and had a dry mouth needing to drink soup. His pulse was strong and large, yet when pressed, it felt weak and thin. This indicated true cold internally with false heat externally. Accordingly, it was essential to follow the evidence: first, he was treated with four doses of Liu Jun Zi Decoction enhanced with roasted ginger and cinnamon. His appetite improved, and all symptoms rapidly receded. Then, he was given the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, adding ginger and cinnamon for over fifty doses, leading to the discharge of the necrotic tissue. After another fifty doses, new flesh began to grow. This individual&#39;s qi and blood were abundant, allowing for easy onset and resolution of ulcers. If the physician had been aware of this, he would have provided preventive care, avoiding this affliction altogether.</p>
<p>A man, having carelessly exerted himself in intimate relations, developed swelling on his back and shoulders that rose about three inches and stretched over a foot wide, with spontaneous and night sweats, a sensation of internal heat and fever, and a dry mouth needing soup. His pulse was floating and large but weak and thin when pressed. This stemmed from a deficiency of essence and weakness of qi. He was treated with ten doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, adding five-flavor herbs, Mai Dong, Shan Yu, and Shan Yao, which resolved all symptoms. Given that he had other issues, a separate prescription of Liu Qi Decoction was also provided; the deficiency symptoms had completely manifested, and the swelling was as hard as stone. I then used the previous formula in six doses, achieving a complete recovery.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the early summer, Yang Gao from Neihan suffered from a back abscess. After taking the detoxifying medication for over two weeks, the area remained swollen and hard, heavy as if burdened by a stone. He had undergone over fifty cauterizations with garlic, but his back became lighter. Administering six gentlemen&#39;s herbs along with sand ginger in two doses caused a flood of saliva, and his food intake reduced. This indicated a deficiency in the spleen and a loss of yang qi. The warming and tonifying medicine led to nausea and a lack of appetite; thus, I reverted to the previous prescription in larger doses, adding aconite, ginger, and cinnamon, but there was no response. I then prescribed one pound each of ginseng and astragalus, half a pound each of white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel, and one tael of aconite, to be decocted and taken for three days. This halted the drooling, caused the necrotic tissue to break down, and allowed him to resume eating. I then used ginger and cinnamon and other herbs to strengthen the spleen, resulting in the necrotic tissue shedding and the ulcer healing.</p>
<p>Wang Dezhi suffered from back pain, his pulse was superficial and rapid; pressing down revealed a thin pulse. He had not had a bowel movement for five to six days, and his abdomen was not distended. I said: The pathogens are on the surface, not internally, but due to a deficiency in qi and blood, and reduced food intake, the bowels are not moving; it is not due to heat accumulation, and we should focus on nourishing qi and blood. However, there was accumulated internal toxicity, and I used rhubarb to purge it, resulting in three or four loose stools and increased fever. The next day, after taking another dose, he continued to have diarrhea, food was not digesting, he suffered from continuous hiccups, and his hands and feet became cold. Upon diagnosing him, his pulse was faint, and I advised against further treatment. His son asked: Could purging be harmful? I replied: If one takes a purgative and diarrhea does not stop, it can be fatal. If one purges when it&#39;s inappropriate and causes endless bowel movements, it can be fatal. If too much fluid is lost, it can be fatal.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: Sores and ulcers are a result of accumulated toxins within the organs. If one does not expel these toxins, how can one find relief? I said: Although the toxins accumulate in the organs in cases of sores and ulcers, the treatment should first assist the stomach’s energy to strengthen the foundation, combined with medicines to invigorate blood circulation at the appropriate times, rather than relying solely on harsh purgatives like Da Huang. Now, if there is an exterior condition yet one were to use extreme purging agents, taking away the yin, how could this be acceptable? Therefore, it is said: In cases of exterior diseases, if one forces a downward action while the interior is harmonized, the vital energy becomes deficient, allowing external pathogens to exploit this weakness, leading to countless variations in malady. Though the pulse may be floating and rapid, indicating that the pathogen is on the surface and external in nature, one should use internal tonics and reconciling decoctions, and even Huang Qin and Cang Zhu should not be used liberally. If the pulse is deep and solid, indicating that the pathogen is internal and attributed to internal causes, one should use Huang Lian Decoction to disperse it internally, and even Da Huang and Bing Lang should be avoided. Moreover, considering the floating and rapid pulses—indicating deficiency of both blood and vital energy—if the pathogen remains at the surface yet one resorts to harsh purgatives to severely deplete the interior, the punishment will be excessive, leading to death, if not immediately.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhang Jinyi, over forty years old, suffered from back pain, and his heart pulse was rapid and forceful, indicating a dangerous condition. A rapid and forceful heart pulse signifies excessive heart fire. The classics state: all pains, itchiness, sores, and ulcers relate to heart fire. The heart governs blood; if the heart energy is stagnant, blood does not circulate, leading to abscesses. To relieve the heart fire, one should apply moxibustion at the acupuncture points related to the heart; urgent moxibustion should be done to drain the heart fire, and garlic can be used in moxibustion to draw out its toxins, then combined with detoxifying agents to achieve complete recovery.</p>
<p>The Ping family&#39;s servant experienced back pain and, after taking over twenty doses of detoxifying medicine, the condition worsened. In a fit of anger, she suddenly vomited five or six bowls of blood, becoming weak with a frail pulse, indicating extreme deficiency of energy and blood. Therefore, I prescribed about a pound of ginseng paste, which slightly eased the condition, followed by over thirty doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, aged tangerine peel, and roasted licorice, leading to a gradual closure of the wound.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Gu Haoshi was over forty years old and suffered from a back ailment, which he treated with a medicinal powder that led to an abscess. Suddenly he began to vomit and experienced pain from the sore; his stomach pulse was tight and wiry, which he believed to be internal toxicity attacking him. Dongyuan stated that vomiting at any time, along with cold hands and feet, indicates a deficiency in the internal organs. Danshi noted that if vomiting occurs after a sore has burst, it signifies internal dampness. Additionally, if pus is discharged but pain returns, this indicates deficiency. His tight and wiry stomach pulse, with wood overpowering earth, clearly indicated deficiency.</p>
<p>I intended to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction, with wine-fried peony root, cardamom, and patchouli to treat him. However, he took Hu Xin San on his own, which worsened the vomiting. When he sought treatment again, I continued with the previous prescription but added tonifying herbs for qi and blood. After two months, he recovered.</p>
<p>In general, if dampness invades internally or if there is a response to contaminated air that causes vomiting, the patient will prefer warmth and have a weak pulse. If heat and toxicity attack and cause vomiting, they will prefer coolness and have a rapid pulse; hence, clear differentiation is necessary. There may also be issues like unsatisfactory bowel movements, abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, or acid reflux, which indicate a deficiency of cold in the intestines and stomach, requiring treatment with Li Zhong Tang. If the condition does not improve, adding two to three slices of processed aconite may help. </p>
<p>If diarrhea occurs in the early morning, it is termed kidney diarrhea and can be treated with Er Shen Wan. If there is a gradual loss of appetite leading to weight loss, it indicates a deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, and it is particularly important to take Er Shen Wan, as it is also a crucial remedy for nocturnal emissions and to build muscle. </p>
<p>I once treated a patient who had little appetite, was preoccupied with thoughts of food, and experienced acid reflux and belching, but none of the medications were effective except for Li Zhong Tang and Fuzi Li Zhong Wan. This condition arises due to deficient and cold middle energy that cannot transform stagnation, hence using warming and tonifying methods will harmonize the middle qi, eliminating such symptoms.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Liu Taizai&#39;s wife, Lady Ziyan, suffered from back pain due to insufficient vital energy and was treated with tuoli medicine, which helped her recover. Wang Anren, whose back was already deteriorating, sought quick results by applying herbal medicine, but died the same day.</p>
<p>Liu Dayin, nearly fifty years old and traveling to the capital while mourning the loss of his son, had a back ailment measuring about six inches. It was not painful, but he experienced fever, dry mouth, chills with spontaneous sweating, reduced appetite, uncontrollable bowel movements, shortness of breath, and a floating, weak pulse. I prescribed four doses of the Shendanqi medicine, adding banxia and fuling, along with moxibustion using garlic. He reported that the heaviness in his back had subsided, though he felt weak, still suffering from sour belching, and he sensed that the food he had eaten the day before was still in his stomach. I then added ginger and cinnamon to the previous medicine and prescribed two more doses. His appetite gradually improved, the sour belching ceased, and he began to sleep, with the wound neither paining nor breaking open, leading me to suspect it was a yin condition. I said: this is due to deficiency of yang, which cannot nourish the affected area; thus, the necrotic tissue neither pains nor ulcerates. If the stomach’s qi recovers and he begins to eat, the dead tissue will certainly ulcerate. I continued the previous medication for six doses, his appetite gradually increased, the affected area began to ulcerate, and the pulse grew stronger. I stated: this indicates the recovery of yang.</p>
<p>Later, misled by other physicians, he insisted on taking Feilong Duoming pill, believing sweating was beneficial. He took a dose that led to excessive sweating, which continued for three days without cessation, prompting him to seek further treatment. I told him: excessive sweating depletes yang, leaving us unable to help. He insisted, claiming: various texts say that if there is sweating, the wound is healed; how can it be a problem? In the end, he indeed died.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Dongyuan says: The sores and ulcers arise from wind and heat stagnating in the lower part of the body. Such individuals are often prone to anger, and their sores are red, swollen, elevated, hard, and painful. The pulse is weak and slow, with a tense quality in the left guan position. This indicates that the evil energy has invaded the blood vessels and resides between the skin layers. Therefore, inducing sweating to circulate the defensive and nutritive Qi will eliminate the pathogenic energy.</p>
<p>Xu Fuqing from Yixing, over forty years old, suffered from a back sore for five days without improvement. The color of the flesh did not change, the pulse was weak, he had little appetite, and his stools were loose. I found that generally, if the sore had not yet burst, the pulse would be weak first, making it hard to gather and contain the condition. I prescribed two doses of the Tuoli Xiaodu San to help initiate the process. However, he heeded an old woman’s advice to apply a medicated plaster and take a toxic-clearing medicine, which made the condition worse; his back felt as heavy as carrying a stone, prompting him to seek my treatment again. </p>
<p>I then performed moxibustion with garlic for more than thirty sessions. He reported that while his back felt heavy, it was merely itchy and painful without any other sensations. I continued using the Tuoli medicine to alleviate the pain and itchiness. The pus became clearer, and I increased the original formula with more ginseng and astragalus, along with ginger and cinnamon, causing the pus to thicken slightly. </p>
<p>Yet, he was misled again by others, applying pig kidneys to draw out the pus and blood, while internally taking a salt and sulfur mixture, which resulted in a blood loss of about five to six bowls and continuous diarrhea for over ten instances. His abdomen felt like ice, and he could not eat or drink. Reluctantly, I hurried to examine him. His pulse had become faint and weak; he was beyond medical help. His symptoms indicated extreme deficiency and insufficiency; although warm tonics could still be considered, I feared they would be ineffective. How could it be that using aggressive remedies would not lead to death!<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Kuang, a successful candidate in the imperial examination, was suffering from a carbuncle that was beginning to heal, but he had severe constipation. He took rhubarb and other medicines, which caused him to lose his appetite. I used a remedy to replenish his qi and blood, adding peach kernels and sesame seeds, but it was ineffective. I then administered pig bile deeply into the gastrointestinal tract, and continued with tonics for his blood and qi, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>Governor Wang&#39;s wife was suffering from a carbuncle on her back that was festering and not breaking open, causing her to feel lethargic and unable to eat. This indicated that poison had entered her body, which could not be treated easily. I forced the issue, using a needle to open up the abscess slightly, and she showed some signs of improvement, but soon after, she passed away. Generally speaking, when a person&#39;s blood and qi are robust, pus will flow out naturally; however, in the elderly and weak, the qi and blood become depleted, making it necessary to confront and expel the pus, to follow the natural order in treatment. If the poison becomes lodged in the limbs, requiring more gentle needling, or if it has festered deeply and extensively, it will be difficult to contain. When there is painful swelling in critical areas such as the cheeks, neck, or abdomen, it is urgent to employ acupuncture, regardless of whether the patient is strong or weak; otherwise, treatment will be challenging.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a></p></div>

<p>Assistant Zhang had a back boil and used only external medicine; the sore did not appear dark, but there was chest distension, making breathing difficult. Believing he could not be cured, he was treated with a warming remedy and recovered.</p>
<p>Wang Tongfu had a back boil for over ten days with a serious condition and a strong pulse. Initially, two doses of sophora flower wine were given to reduce the severity; then, two doses of detoxifying medicine, followed by several doses of a warming remedy, gradually led to the boil breaking. He applied moxa on the affected area for a long time daily and continued with ointment; after moxibustion several times, pus burst out and decayed. A warming remedy with white atractylodes and dried tangerine peel was used, and after over a month, he recovered.</p>
<p>Deng Dayin had a back boil. After six or seven days, his back was swollen and painful, the condition serious. He received moxa treatments with garlic paste for a hundred times, drank two bowls of sophora flower wine, and then slept; subsequently, he took a detoxifying remedy, and after ten doses, he felt relieved. He was advised to apply moxa to the affected area, leading to his recovery in a few days.</p>
<p>Eunuch Liu Guan suffered from a back boil, and I was ordered to treat him. The swelling was painful and purple, with a pulse that was deep and rapid. Chen Liangfu said: a rapid pulse with heat and pain indicates an external yang condition. Moreover, if the sore is very red and purple, it signifies extreme heat resembling water. Inquiry revealed he had taken Bone-Penetrating Pill for half a year, resulting in accumulated heat. Therefore, a cleansing Huanglian Decoction was given, followed by more balanced medicine. He was then treated with pus-dispersing detoxifying powder, pig’s hoof soup, and Taiyi ointment, achieving recovery. As the classics say, color and pulse should correspond. The practitioner should understand the principles of excess and deficiency, and the mechanisms of yin and yang transformations.<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar developed a swelling on his back, which was soft when pressed, with the normal flesh color. His diet remained unaffected, but he felt fatigued and coughed up phlegm when laboring. This indicated a deficiency of the spleen and stagnation of phlegm. I treated him with a tonifying formula to replenish the center and benefit qi, adding Poria and Pinellia, with a little Qianghuo, and applied a medicine called Yin-Yang Powder externally, mixed with ginger juice to aid in absorption. Later, due to fatigue and brain strain, he experienced vomiting. I used the previous formula but omitted Qianghuo, adding fresh ginger and Vitex to achieve recovery.</p>
<p>Chen Xun&#39;s wife had been bedridden for thirteen years. During the Jia Jing period in the year of Gui Mao, she became even more melancholic due to misfortunes. In the third month of the year of Jia Chen, a lump formed under her right shoulder, swollen like a bowl, red on the inside and white outside. First, I prescribed a cooling medication, which did not resolve the issue; then, I used a formula called Shi Xuan San for four doses, which caused slight redness and pain. Upon the visit from Xu Nanlou, I prescribed a combination of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, cinnamon, and ligusticum, leading to the formation of pus. Xu said: &quot;No longer ill,&quot; and took his leave. Later, she experienced dizziness and vomiting, foul chills and shivering, and the pus had cleared. </p>
<p>By chance, I referenced my &quot;Surgical Treatise,&quot; which states: &quot;If at the initial stage there is a small nodule resembling a grain, with no swelling or redness, accompanied by restlessness and constipation, within four or five days, numerous nodules can form, each like a grain, named &#39;Lotus Flower Nodules.&#39;&quot; This initially seemed like a severe condition; although the treatment methods were detailed, I was not well-versed in practice. Xu came to me for diagnosis and I stated: &quot;Spicy and cooling dispersal should be avoided if there is deficiency of both qi and blood.&quot; I then prescribed large doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, rehmannia, ginger, and dang shen. The swelling increased and the pus thickened, requiring the application of a black ointment. After several days, the discharge resembled pieces of greasy film. Each dose of ginseng was increased to eight taels, taking two doses a day, and in over two months, she returned to a stable state.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a></p></div>

I went elsewhere and returned after three days; he could not eat, the central flesh was dying, his bowel movements were blocked, and his urine was red and turbid.

He initially wondered if the interruption of tonics was to blame? I said: Yes. Therefore, he urgently took the Six Gentleman Decoction, adding Angelica, Bupleurum, and Cimicifuga; food intake gradually increased, bowel movements resumed, and an external application of black ointment was used on the central area for about three inches.

<p>Governor Zhu Yangshan suffered from a back sore that was swollen and dark in color, slightly swollen with thirst.

I first used two doses of the Lifesaving Decoction to eliminate the poison, then in the morning, I used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to strengthen the qi and blood.

Since I had a good relationship with him, I felt sorrowful about his inability to manage his burial arrangements. I thus entrusted his colleague Zhang Donghua and others to strongly persuade him to take restorative measures, but he only excreted purple blood, a sign of extreme deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Zhao Family Medical Canon&quot; states: A gardener suffered from a troublesome back ailment that was quite severe. He was instructed to obtain five or six taels of gold-silver vine, pound it into pieces, mix it with a small cup of hot wine, stir well, drink the warm juice, and apply the residue to the affected area. After taking this remedy four or five times, he was cured. Finding this method effective, he began to use it for anyone with sores, achieving a successful treatment every time. He then gained health and stability in his family, eventually abandoning his gardening work.</p>
<p>&quot;The Essence of External Medicine&quot; mentions: A man over fifty had a sore on his back for thirteen days, unable to consume any food or drink. His back was hard like carrying a stone, and he remained silent with discomfort. He requested a consultation. Despite the severity of the sore, the skin was purple, but I observed that the roots and foot of the sore were clearly defined, suggesting that the poison had not yet penetrated deeply, indicating it was treatable. It was essential to draw out the toxic gases without allowing them to attack internally. </p>
<p>Herbal medicine was prepared and administered twice, resulting in a significant amount of evil blood being drawn out; additionally, due to his firm pulse leading to constipation, I administered a mixture of Huanglian decoction and pig bile to help relieve the internal pressure. After passing stool twice, both internal and external toxic gases were able to be expelled, allowing him to sleep peacefully at night and relieving most of the heaviness in his back. </p>
<p>Next, I provided medications to eliminate pus and used the mulberry wood moxibustion technique externally. The swelling and hardness gradually began to decompose, and pus started to emerge. After switching to a tonic such as the Fully Nourishing Decoction, supplemented with Mai Men Dong and several doses of Wuyuan, the necrotic tissue detached on its own, and his appetite steadily improved. Over the course of two months of careful regulation, he eventually recovered.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>An old woman nearing seventy suffered from a sore on her back for over half a month, and her condition was utterly alarming. Her family had given up on treatment and were in despair, preparing for her final affairs. They summoned me to examine the child&#39;s ailments, and when I inquired about the situation, the entire family, young and old, expressed that they awaited death at any moment. I insisted on examining her condition; I saw that her sore covered half her back and was swollen. Although the sore was neither elevated nor sunken, when pressed, it felt firm on the outside yet rotten within. The elderly woman&#39;s internal weakness and the pus and toxins trapped inside prevented it from expelling outward. Despite her lack of appetite, I noted that her feet were unaffected and her internal organs had no discoloration, which indicated a possibility of life. The family was stubborn and skeptical, claiming that divination with turtle shells had foretold her inevitable death, so how could treatment possibly save her? I lamented: What a pity! If left untreated for three or four more days, the internal membranes would rupture, and she would surely die. This fate was unjust! The next day, feeling compelled, I went to seek treatment for her.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heaving a deep sigh, he said: &quot;I am not forcing him; I truly see that he is alive and cannot bear to abandon him to death. Thus, I desire to treat him, offering medical care without accepting any payment, waiting for the patient to heal and seeing how they compensate me afterward. The crowd is willing to agree. </p>
<p>First, I used an onion and mugwort soup to wash the wound. The surface was covered in rotten, stubborn flesh, so I used a fine needle and sharp scissors to carefully remove two inches of this stubborn flesh and opened the pus channel. Gently pressing with my hands, I drained the collected pus and blood, estimating about three bowls. Those watching could not help but nod in distress. </p>
<p>Once the pus and blood were somewhat drained, I washed the area again with the same soup and sealed it with an ointment. Internally, I prescribed three doses of the Great Restoration Decoction to replenish the vital energy. Later, I used a Ginseng Nourishing Decoction with double the ginseng and white atractylodes, adding peony to it. I also mixed in Eight Flavor Pills and Eight Immortals Cake for nutritional balance, aiming to strengthen the spleen so the patient could eat and the necrotic flesh would regenerate. </p>
<p>Moreover, this woman was diligent in her care and made no major changes; within a hundred days, her wound healed and her body was healthy and stable. From then on, I was believed, with no one doubting my words.&quot;<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A candidate for the position had passed his fifties, and had a chronic thirst; his body was exceedingly stout, and he had a hair growing from his back, about a foot long. After twelve days, he requested treatment. Upon examining his wound, it appeared slightly swollen, with a pale red color, and the edges were both contracted and dispersed; this indicates a balance of Yin and Yang. Moreover, with a stout person who harbors internal weakness, the wound is large, and without significant nourishment and support, it would be difficult for the wound to heal, and the poison would likely penetrate deeply, which could be too late to address.</p>
<p>At first, I administered a remedy to invigorate his internal health. After fifteen days, I used a fine needle, making three small punctures at the top, to allow the internal toxins a path to exit. Since the condition was severe, I was cautious not to let too much out, lest it exhaust the vital energy and impede the formation of pus. I prescribed a combination of ginseng and astragalus, increasing each to nine grams as an internal remedy, and continued this for twenty days, at which point the pus began to develop.</p>
<p>In the morning, I used a ginseng and angelica preparation; at noon, I prescribed a Ten Complete Decoction with additional ginseng and astragalus totaling twelve grams, with a touch of ophiopogon and schisandra each at three grams. This continued for over a month, as the flesh began to necrose and discharge, with pus flowing like a gushing spring. Occasionally, I used a Holy Recovery Decoction and Eight Immortals Cake for supporting and regulating his condition, bolstering his spleen and stomach to improve his appetite.</p>
<p>Later, concerned that the previous medicines might not be sufficient, I added cooked aconite at three grams to the mixture, pleased that his spleen was strong and the pus was thick and yellow. After forty days, the situation of the wound began to slightly improve.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It was mid-summer, and the weather was scorching. The patient was very restless, quickly drinking two bowls of cold water. By evening, the sore began to sink, suddenly changing to a dark state, without pain or pus. The body felt cool, and the pulse was thin; there was abdominal pain and coldness in the feet, prompting them to request a consultation. The sore appeared soft and sunken, and the pulse was also faint. This sore had changed due to cold; it required warmth, not spicy heat for restoration. </p>
<p>I urgently prescribed the Twelve Flavor Disperse Formula, doubling the dosages of ginseng and prepared aconite to three qians each. It was ineffective; the medicine could not overcome the cold. I then switched to fresh aconite and ginseng, each five qians, to be taken in the morning and evening. This would warm the body and raise the pulse, making the sore higher and painful again. After two more doses, pus began to flow as before. </p>
<p>Large amounts of pus continued to exit for about a month, totaling over a hundred bowls, without decreasing. The outer skin became red but did not rot. This fat person was externally robust but internally weak, hence the skin did not rot while the inside deteriorated. I then applied Yu Hong ointment on a cotton pad and pushed it inside the sore, covering it with the ointment, which gradually helped the inner decay to peel away. </p>
<p>Ten days later, a large piece of rotten flesh, weighing about six liang, was expelled. After that, the swelling reduced, the pus decreased, and new flesh gradually grew. It took over a hundred days to finally restore health. More than five jin of ginseng and over ten liang of aconite were used to achieve complete safety. If detoxifying and spleen-harming medicines were employed, along with harsh spicy heat for nourishment, how could one hope for recovery?<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A local official, aged over seventy years, developed a sore on his right back that had persisted for eight days. Upon examination, the sore, though slightly swollen, was pale and not red, resembling a turtle&#39;s shape, with its roots spreading without being elevated. This was due to the elderly&#39;s declining vitality and blood. The pulse was slightly rapid but strong, indicating that there was still some foundation present; although old, it could still be treated. </p>
<p>I pursued treatment to drain the pus and enhance internal absorption, using medicinal herbs combined with a topical application to promote the formation of pus. After thirteen days, the swelling increased and the color turned more red, but it failed to properly rupture and expel pus, likely due to weak digestion from inadequate nourishment. I prescribed Shenqi Dabu Decoction over several doses, resulting in gradual pus production, but not yet swift or efficient. The stagnation of pus was evidence that the internal membranes were not communicating properly; one must not lament over age but treat more crucial matters. </p>
<p>I then employed a fine needle to open the sore approximately two inches deep, facilitating the drainage of pus. After clearing it with pig&#39;s trotter soup, I applied topical medications once daily, causing the outer layers to gradually degenerate into pus. The patient appeared emaciated and dull, so I administered Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang, increasing the quantities of ginseng and astragalus substantially. Any decaying flesh was removed, and care was taken to nurture any new flesh that desired to form. However, due to age and low vitality, the recovery process was slow. Additionally, I provided ginseng and atractylodes paste for him to take twice daily until the new flesh formed, and after adjusting his diet significantly for seventy-five days, he finally stabilized.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar, over sixty years old, suffered from a carbuncle on his back for ten days. Upon examining the sore, it was hard and dark purple in color, surrounded by abundant hair, resembling a snail, and about a foot long, with roots extending across half his back. It was high, swollen, shiny, hot, and painful, and his pulse was strong and rapid. This sore was likely caused by the combination of rich food, alcohol, and damp heat. Despite its severity, it was manageable.</p>
<p>He was treated with three types of medicinal applications, which were accordingly administered. The center of the sore, resembling a snail, was meant to be expelled, so a method was employed to draw it out. Additionally, it released foul blood, which was washed with scallion broth, then cleaned and treated with medicine. Paper was applied over it and around the roots with a detoxifying powder to absorb the toxic gases and prevent further expansion.</p>
<p>The following day, treatment continued as before. After three days, the outer flesh gradually began to decay, and additional medication was applied to support the spleen and stomach and to convert the toxins into pus. Early on, he took an eight-herb pill to nourish his kidney water, and the hoof broth was changed. He continued to apply a soothing plaster, waiting for the decay to complete to a depth of about an inch. Gradually, he used Juhong ointment, applying it daily. However, this man had a tendency to drink, and even in illness, he could not restrain himself. </p>
<p>Two months later, although new flesh had formed, it was delicate and could not properly close over the sore. He was thus advised to refrain from drinking. Subsequently, the tender flesh was all cut away, and a plaster was applied for several days, waiting for the flesh to mature and become even. Pearl powder was introduced in small amounts several times until a layer formed over the wound, and it was stabilized after eighty days.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a></p></div>

It appeared on the lower back, above the kidney area, evenly raised, about eight inches wide, with the root swelling and a color akin to water. The top was soft and lacking vitality, resembling rot but not entirely rotten. The pulse was floating and large, weak upon heavy pressure; this sore was prone to bursting and not conducive to healing. Therefore, it should not be treated.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The treatment should consist of five coins of medicine, along with an additional two coins as a supplement, to properly address the illness. Otherwise, complications are bound to arise. However, they do not believe this. As a result, the patient’s flesh becomes pale and white, the wounds widen, and the pus is thin and watery, leading to decreased appetite; these are clear signs of decline. Even if they later aggressively administer warming and spleen-strengthening tonics, it ultimately proves ineffective, leading to emaciation and foul-smelling pus, extending for up to sixty days, draining their vital energy and blood until death ensues. Then they only regret their choices. They do not understand that for a large sore, producing a bowl of pus each day, three coins of ginseng are essential as a standard. Given that this condition produces pus yielding three bowls daily, administering just two coins of ginseng is considered a major loss with minimal gain—doesn’t this lead to death? Moreover, external medicine often deals with conditions where a breach leads to the leakage of true vital energy; if loss and supplementation conflict, it frequently results in irreparable damage. This stems from a disbelief in tonics and clinging to common misconceptions, ultimately leading to self-destructive outcomes.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man nearing sixty in age, during the peak of summer, had over twenty hot sores on his back. His family invited me to look at his grandson&#39;s illness, and when I saw him sitting in the hall, his back was covered with sores. Upon closer inspection, I noticed one sore that was much smaller than the others, but contained a much greater poison. I said, &quot;This sore is not merely a boil; once it erupts, it cannot be managed.&quot; He laughed and replied, thinking there was no serious issue. Later, as he was escorted to the door, I urged him again, saying, &quot;You must quickly seek another physician for treatment; do not delay.&quot; They did not believe me. </p>
<p>Ten days later, his condition slightly worsened, and one doctor treated him, again stating, &quot;It is just a boil.&quot; Another ten days passed, the situation deteriorated, and symptoms of decay emerged. Only then did they start to somewhat believe my earlier words and sought my opinion again. When I entered the hall, he was lying covered with cloth over the sore, and after taking only two or three steps, I turned back. Someone asked, &quot;Why?&quot; I said, &quot;The decay is rising; his death is imminent. There is no need to inspect the sore; prepare for the aftermath instead; he will die in another seven days.&quot; Ultimately, the result was just as I predicted, not off by a moment. This illustrates the folly of avoiding medical attention while ignoring illnesses, which leads to one&#39;s own downfall.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Comprehensive Book of Jingyue&quot; states: My eldest son was born in the year of Gui Chou. In the fifth month of the year of Yi Mao, at just two years old, he developed a back abscess. At first, there was a sudden slight swelling in his back; after a few days, upon pressing it, the root deepened and grew wider, becoming as large as a bowl, yet the skin color did not change and it was not very painful. After more than ten days, he experienced a slight fever, and the condition worsened. Therefore, we consulted a sore doctor. Some claimed it was a back abscess, others called it phlegm and qi. They all said to avoid all rich foods entirely; thus, we administered a detoxifying medicine. However, this resulted in an increase in fever, and he became more spiritless, unable to eat. I was greatly alarmed and remembered that Danxi said: abscesses arise from accumulated toxins in the organs; one should first strengthen the stomach qi to solidify the foundation and then engage in blood circulation to assist. He also said: when swelling and pain are observed, coupled with weak pulse signs, one should fortify and nourish; if the qi and blood are not deficient, one can ensure a favorable outcome. This is indeed a sound analysis.<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to previously disregarding the medicine and solely fortifying the vital energy while hosting its poison, three qian of ginseng, one qian of prepared aconite, alongside angelica, cooked rehmannia, roasted licorice, and cinnamon were used. After one dose, the appetite significantly improved, and after another, his spirit was as before. But what spirit was this! Thus, he relaxed his dietary restrictions, and both medicine and food were taken together. After ten doses, pus formed; given the depth of roots and thickness of skin, using needles extracted a great deal of pus. After a month of regulation, he recovered. If trust had been placed in common practitioners, with strict avoidance of warming and nourishing flavors while focusing solely on detoxification, his stomach qi would have daily diminished, the toxic energy would have increasingly invaded, leading to an inability to eat. If it had resulted in internal ulceration, it would have been utterly perilous. Moreover, this child had no signs of deficiency diseases; how could one act carelessly? It was because he presented a yin condition without actual pathogens, but with clear causes present, that he dared to vigorously nourish the spleen and kidneys, ensuring a thorough preservation of health. Alas! The relationship of medicine is always about categorization. Thus, this case is recorded to inform future practitioners. In cases of swelling and abscesses, whenever deficiency signs are absent but there is no evidence of real heat blockage, it is advisable to nourish. In this way, the benefits from those who do not know cannot be adequately expressed in words.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p></div>
