<p><strong>Epileptic Conditions</strong> [to be consulted in conjunction with the section on mania]</p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Major Oddities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two Yin Energies lead to sudden seizures.</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>[Note: The two yin refer to Shaoyin. Epileptic seizures occur when water Qi ascends to the heart, hence the urgency of the two yin pulse.] The heart pulse is full and large, with spasms and convulsions; the liver pulse is small and rapid, also with spasms and convulsions. [Note: This indicates a deficiency of the liver and coldness preventing nourishment to the sinews, resulting in convulsions.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Spirit Pivot, Chapter on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The bladder meridian of the Foot Taiyang is responsible for diseases originating in the sinews, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, and epilepsy. [Note: When the meridians reverse at the lower body, it results in epilepsy and mania.]**</p>
<p><strong>From the Thousand Gold Prescriptions (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>There are five types of mania: the first is Yang mania, which occurs when the patient appears dead, experiences incontinence, and may relieve themselves after a while; the second is Yin mania, which occurs in individuals sitting for long periods with unhealed umbilical sores and due to frequent bathing; the third is Wind mania, where symptoms include eye movements, strong pulls, goat-like bleating, and relief after eating, often induced by laboring in the wind or excessive sexual activity, leading to heart Qi being forced, causing shortness of breath and palpitations; the fourth is Damp mania, characterized by pain in the forehead, a heavy body, sauna use, dampness affecting the brain, and occurs particularly when sweating has not ceased; the fifth is Horse mania, where symptoms include rolling eyes, locked jaws, body warmth, and onset while sitting with excessive wind disturbance leading to brain heat imbalance. [Note: This pertains to epilepsy, which has been classified among similar conditions by previous scholars. The manifestations of epilepsy differ, yet the underlying causes are the same, thus they are now categorized this way.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, when examined through various methods, presents different names and symptoms that are difficult to document comprehensively. According to the &quot;Bielu&quot; (Separate Records), there are five types of epilepsy: the first is &quot;horse epilepsy,&quot; characterized by neighing and related to the heart; the second is &quot;sheep epilepsy,&quot; characterized by bleating and related to the spleen; the third is &quot;chicken epilepsy,&quot; characterized by crowing and related to the stomach; the fourth is &quot;pig epilepsy,&quot; characterized by grunting and related to the kidneys; and the fifth is &quot;cow epilepsy,&quot; characterized by mooing and related to the lungs. These five types of epilepsy correspond to five livestock animals and their respective five organs.</p>
<p>In episodes, there occur sudden dizziness, involuntary movements of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyes, twitching of the hands and feet, rigidity of the back, and a return to awareness after a while. The cause is often due to a disturbance in the vital energy of the organs resulting from shock, leading to the generation of phlegm and blockage of the meridians, thus producing these symptoms. The causes may stem from fear experienced in the womb, from exposure to wind, cold, heat, or dampness in infancy, or from inappropriate eating habits which disrupt the vital energy.</p>
<p>For those suffering from epilepsy, particularly those under ten years of age, it is generally classified as epilepsy. The origins of the episodes can typically be categorized into three types: wind-related, shock-related, and food-related epilepsy. These three types can manifest as various forms of epilepsy. If not treated promptly, they may develop into chronic conditions. The manifestations occur suddenly with involuntary movements of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyes, or twitching of the hands and feet, along with stiffness of the back, bending of the neck, or shaking of the head and tongue movements. During a seizure, one should not restrain the person, as holding them can lead to dislocation and hinder their movements.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>On Filial Duties of Confucians</strong><br><em>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</em></p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy does not manifest with eyes wide open like a fool; it can be treated with the Three Saint Powder. Additionally, prepare a large basin in a warm room to induce sweating and expel through three methods simultaneously, then take the Tong Sheng Powder. After a hundred days, one will recover. However, if the eyes are wide and look foolish, it cannot be treated. The Inner Classic states: “When the spirit cannot be preserved, it means the spirit is chaotic.” Generally, when wind-induced epilepsy occurs, the neck stiffens and one stares blankly, showing a loss of awareness; this indicates heat in the liver meridian. If there is teeth grinding, first use a bitter decoction of celery to expel it; after expulsion, one can take the Xie Qing Pill. Afterwards, use the modified Tong Sheng Powder. In clear cases of teeth grinding, using the Dao Chi Powder will lead to recovery. If a seizure occurs, one may use light powder, white alunite, Mongolian stone, and red lead stone; once recovered, adjust with rice drink. The classics say: “Use heavy doses to calm it.”<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment Verification</strong></p>
<p>For cases of shock and phlegm, it is advisable to induce vomiting, primarily focusing on phlegm. Use Huang Lian, Nan Xing, (Caoshe) Lou, and Ban Xia, seeking to eliminate phlegm in varying amounts. All can be cured through this method. When distinguishing between phlegm and heat, if there is heat, use cooling medicines to clear the heart; if there is phlegm, vomiting medicine must be used. After inducing vomiting, take Dongyuan Anshen Pill. The main method should be to vomit, and afterwards use liver-soothing medicines such as Qing Dai, Chai Hu, and Chuan Xiong, with Longhui Pill being particularly suitable.</p>
<p>In cases where epilepsy is caused by shock, the spirit fails to reside properly, leading to phlegm accumulation. There are five types of epilepsy: horse, cow, chicken, pig, and sheep. For instance, horse epilepsy shows mouth opening and head shaking with neighing; cow epilepsy presents with eyes staring straight and abdominal distension; chicken epilepsy involves head shaking and a tendency to be startled; sheep epilepsy is characterized by uplifted eyes and tongue protrusion; pig epilepsy often leads to excessive salivation. All these conditions are merely different manifestations of phlegm obstructing the orifices, causing a disorienting state leading to symptoms like dizziness, convulsions of the limbs, facial and body rigidity, excessive shouting, salivation, and recovery shortly after eating. It is advisable to add Xiang San and three whole scorpions.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In the case of a great yang collapse, the head becomes swollen and heavy, the feet cannot move, and one may suddenly faint in a daze. This occurs because the yang energy is disordered, causing one to fall unconscious and unaware. When the energy recovers, the person awakens; this is then a type of epilepsy. The condition of epilepsy is primarily due to phlegm, arising from the movement of fire. The treatment for epilepsy should involve vomiting. If one appears mentally detached with eyes wide open in a foolish manner, I am unsure how to address that.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>A weak, wiry pulse indicates fright or wind epilepsy, while a deep, rapid pulse reflects phlegm heat. A slippery, large pulse indicates self-recovery, while a deep, small, urgent pulse suggests death; a weak, wiry, urgent pulse also indicates death. A deep, large, slippery pulse at the wrist suggests a solid condition; if deep, it is solid, and if slippery, it is energetic. If solid energy clashes, it leads to death if it enters the organs, but it can lead to recovery if it affects the bowels.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Medical Overview</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, or &quot;dizziness of the head,&quot; occurs when phlegm is present in the diaphragm, causing mild dizziness that does not lead to fainting. When phlegm overflows above the diaphragm, it results in severe dizziness that leads to falling to the ground, without awareness of one&#39;s surroundings; this condition is termed epilepsy. Xu Sibao states that adults refer to it as &quot;epilepsy,&quot; while children refer to it simply as &quot;convulsions,&quot; though it is essentially one disease. However, it differs from conditions like windstroke, cold stroke, heatstroke, and rage fainting. In the case of epilepsy, during an episode, sounds are emitted from the mouth, with the possibility of foaming at the mouth, followed by a period of unconsciousness before experiencing another episode. In contrast, conditions such as windstroke, cold stroke, heatstroke, and rage fainting typically occur silently, without foam during fainting, and do not recur after unconsciousness, though some may have infrequent episodes, they are not like the frequent occurrences in epilepsy.</p>
<p>To treat the condition, for those with hidden, strong pulses and experiencing convulsive episodes with signs of fury or heat, perform moxibustion on the third and ninth vertebrae and administer a special herbal remedy known as the &quot;Magical Fragrance Pill,&quot; prepared by puncturing a small hole in a gourd, soaking it in cold water for a short time, and taking it as prescribed. For those with thin and weak pulses exhibiting convulsions resembling madness, use the &quot;Li Henan Five-Ming Pill.&quot; </p>
<p>For chronic cases of wind epilepsy that do not respond to treatment, augment the &quot;Thick Bark Pill&quot; with additional ingredients during spring and autumn, and add 1.5 taels of ginseng, calamus, and poria to each dosage, mixing well before consumption.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Epilepsy, as well as conditions like stroke, chills, heat stroke, dampness, qi blockage, and corpse blockage that lead to dizziness and fainting, all arise from evil qi rebelling upwards and disturbing the head. In the case of epilepsy, it is phlegm evil that rises. Conditions like stroke from cold, heat, dampness, and qi blockage also involve similar evil qi rising. When evil qi rises, the qi in the head becomes chaotic; when the qi in the head is disordered, the vessels become obstructed, and the apertures do not function, leading to a lack of awareness, failure to recognize sounds or people, and ultimately fainting to the ground. Since the disease affects the top of the head, it is called epilepsy. Treatments may involve expelling phlegm to address the disturbance or suppressing it, managing phlegm to prevent qi from rising, using light dispersing techniques for wind, cold, heat, and dampness, or employing acupuncture to guide qi through the vessels in the head, all of which can restore the flow in the vessels at the top of the head and open the apertures, preventing dizziness. Thus, it is understood that the disorder of epilepsy, associated with qi tumult in the head, is indeed a singular condition. Wang Taifu mistakenly divided epilepsy into two diseases, but only Master Sun was able to recognize it as one. Hence, this discussion on the tumultuous qi of the head is specifically placed at the beginning of the chapter on epilepsy to help people understand the disease&#39;s nature and its proper treatment.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Different from Madness</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy resembles madness, but epilepsy occurs intermittently and affects the five organs, whereas madness persists for a long time and primarily attacks the heart. </p>
<p><strong>The Disease is Just Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>The internal injury is most common, while external causes are quite rare. The injury from food and drink accumulates, forming phlegm-fire that obstructs the mind. Fear, anxiety, and anger exacerbate the fire, leading to the spirit losing its home, leaving it empty and filled with phlegm. Danxi states: Epilepsy arises from phlegm obstructing the heart&#39;s pathways; it manifests as sudden dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsions in the limbs, facial distortions, rigidity of the chest and back, shouting, and foaming at the mouth, with recovery following shortly after. When the illness begins with body heat and a floating pulse, it is yang epilepsy related to the six fu organs and is easy to treat. When it begins with body cold and a sinking pulse, it is yin epilepsy related to the five zang organs and is difficult to treat. If the spirit appears drained and the eyes are wide open, resembling foolishness, it is untreatable.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Five Types of Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, when prolonged, must return to the five organs. Liver epilepsy results in a pale face, head shaking, startled expressions, and mimicking a rooster&#39;s crow. Heart epilepsy leads to a flushed face, open mouth, head shaking, and sounds like a horse neighing. Spleen epilepsy presents with a yellow face, diarrhea, tongue protrusion, and bleating like a sheep. Lung epilepsy is characterized by a white face, foaming at the mouth, abdominal bloating, and sounds like a cow. Kidney epilepsy involves a dark face, staring like a corpse, and emitting sounds like a pig. These five epilepsy symptoms are merely classifications. In reality, they stem from phlegm, fire, and fright.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm, Fire, and Fright</strong></p>
<p>Obese individuals tend to have more phlegm, which makes noise and froths when they move. For wind phlegm, use a decoction containing three pieces of scorpion mixed with star anise and ginger. Alternatively, there are Fengfeng Quphlegm pills or Wusheng pills. For fright-induced phlegm, use Zishi powder, Jingqi pills, Baolong pills, or Sanxian pills. To calm the spirit, use Shendan or Shouxing pills. If caused by anger, use Shunqi Daotan soup with sweet flag and cinnabar; if due to worry, use Miaoxiang powder. For food phlegm, utilize Xiaoping powder. For thin individuals with excessive fire and a flushed face, consider Fangfeng Danggui decoction, or Minzhong soup with Nanshen, or various pills including Gunphlegm, Xieqing, Niuhuang Qingxin pills, Longnao Anshen pills, or Qianjin Longdan soup. If both phlegm and fire are excessive, use Zhi Xin pills, taking with warm wine to expel stubborn old phlegm. Common remedies include Duanxian pills, Huohufei pills, Bianfu powder, Siyan pills, and Zijindan.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>Epilepsy is fundamentally caused by phlegm-heat combined with shock, thus cooling remedies to clear the heart, reduce fire, and transform phlegm should be the primary focus. Therefore, ancient treatments used Erchen Decoction combined with (herbs) such as Chuan Bei Mu, Nanshen, and Huang Lian to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one must take Zhushay Anshen Wan to reduce southern fire, and Da Ai Long Hui Wan to balance the eastern wood. However, to transform phlegm, one must first regulate the qi; to regulate qi, one must first adjust the middle. If phlegm is stubbornly adhesive, how can it be guided without the aid of pungent and warm remedies? Hence, ancient methods for treating epilepsy all used warming agents. For instance, Qian Zhongyang treated childhood epilepsy; after inducing vomiting and diarrhea, and having consumed too many cooling medicines, the body became cold, eyes closed, and appetite ceased. Later, he used Yihuang San to replenish the center, enabling the child to eat, and then administered Shenqi Wan to replenish northern kidney water so that speech could return. This should be done prudently to rescue the severe symptoms of epilepsy and can be considered an effective method.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Guguin Medical Insight</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin)</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy has five types, corresponding to the five animals and thus the five organs. During a seizure, one suddenly collapses, with the mouth and eyes twitching, hands and feet convulsing, the back becomes rigid, saliva is foamed at the mouth, and the sounds made resemble animal cries, recovering only after a while. The causes can be due to unresolved emotional distress, external evils affecting the body, overwhelming fear causing a loss of spirit, or lingering childhood trauma that leaves one vulnerable, all resulting in phlegm obscuring the mind. To treat it, there is no need to differentiate into five types; one should expel phlegm and soothe the qi, clear heat, and pacify the liver, using herbs like Huanglian, (Cao) Lou, Nánxīng, and Bànxià, adjusting the amounts as needed, ensuring effective treatment. For those with heat, cool herbs should cleanse the heart; phlegm must be resolved through purging methods, followed by calming remedies like Dongyuan Anshen Pill, along with liver-pacifying herbs such as Qingdai, Chaihu, and Chuanxiong. A weak and tense pulse indicates shock and indicates a seizure from wind.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Medicine&#39;s Essential Guidelines: Six Key Points</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>General Overview</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the occurrence of epilepsy arises from the upward rebellion of the yin fire within the kidneys, which then affects the liver, leading to convulsions. When convulsions occur, the body&#39;s fluids are forced upwards, causing the qi to rise and be expelled from the mouth. The movement of qi within the kidneys is the origin of vitality; if the kidneys are weakened, the determination wanes, resulting in a disturbed spirit, rebellious fire, and an attack on phlegm, leading to convulsions. Sometimes, external pathogens invade through the meridians, causing deep internal injuries that damage the origin of life energy. This results in chaos between the pathogenic and healthy forces, obstructing the flow of qi at the Tian Shu point. The defensive qi remains trapped in the yin, unable to circulate. When circulation is hindered, the yin qi accumulates, and when it reaches extreme levels, it manifests, causing the fire of the life gate to rise from below and block the orifices, resulting in only a few utterances resembling a sheep&#39;s bleat. The body’s fluids, along with the spleen&#39;s saliva, surge up to the chest and are expelled through the mouth. The five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians cannot withstand this upward pressure, thus leading to sudden loss of consciousness. After eating, when the fire dissipates, the person regains awareness. If the life energy has not yet returned, the remaining evil will gradually intensify and reoccur. The so-called origin of life energy refers to that which exists in the beginning of life; it commences with a connection to the navel and is linked to the fetus, following the mother&#39;s breathing. If the mother experiences shock, the qi becomes muddled, and over time, this leads to issues. The life gate is simply the true yang point below the navel within the kidneys. If it is again attacked by external pathogens, it will manifest. In this way, if the origin of life is harmed by evil, the individual will appear frail and weak, ensuring a short lifespan.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>Epilepsy and convulsive stroke are similar, but in epilepsy, the person falls with sounds from the mouth, produces saliva when awakening, and after waking, may relapse. Some have repeated episodes over several days, while others may have three to five episodes in a single day. In strokes, caused by wind, cold, or heat, the person falls silently, has no saliva upon waking, and does not relapse after waking. Although convulsions also come and go, the body is rigid and may arch like a bow, unlike epilepsy where the body is soft, and it may produce sounds similar to those of pigs, dogs, cattle, or sheep. </p>
<p>The &quot;Original Disease Formulas&quot; indicate that excessive heat can lead to wind, combined with dryness, causing excessive saliva in the chest and diaphragm, resulting in symptoms like confusion, stiffness, and falling. The &quot;Three Causes&quot; suggest that an internal imbalance due to shock can lead to saliva production, blocking the meridians, which results in fainting; this can occur from fright while in the womb, exposure to the six pathogenic factors, or irregular eating, which may go against the internal energy. Thus, the causes differ—those obtained externally through improper qi and those internally through fear, along with diet-related issues belonging to both inner and outer influences. The different causes require different treatment methods.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>For those who are startled, the Calm Spirit Pill can stabilize them. For those with phlegm, the Three Sacred Powder can induce vomiting. For those with heat, the Clear Spirit Decoction can cool them. If there is a need to purge, then the Chengqi Decoction can be used.</p>
<p>When the hair is ruffled at dawn, it pertains to the foot Shao Yang; in the morning, it relates to the foot Jue Yin; at midday, it corresponds to the foot Tai Yang; at dusk, it associates with the foot Tai Yin; when one is settled, it connects to the foot Yang Ming; when one is awake at midnight, it pertains to the foot Shao Yin. In decoctions, each should add guiding herbs.</p>
<p>Liu Zonghou said: Yin and Yang seizures are akin to sudden shock, with Yang seizures not caused by vomiting or purging, arising instead from phlegm and heat lingering between the heart and stomach, triggered by a loud startle. If heat is vigorous, even without a startle, it can manifest on its own. Cold herbs should be used to attack and treat it. Yin seizures also originate from phlegm-heat. If treated excessively with cold and cooling methods, it harms the spleen and stomach, transforming into Yin conditions. It is advisable to use warm, balanced herbs to tonify and dry phlegm for treatment. If one argues there is a distinction of Yin and Yang without bad syndromes, it refers to the phlegm-heat affecting the organs and their depth. Can it be said that seizure disorders inherently stem from Yin cold?<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>On the Discussion of Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, referred to as &quot;dian,&quot; is indeed related to &quot;xian.&quot; The &quot;Neijing&quot; discusses &quot;dian&quot; in great detail, while there is no clear distinction made for &quot;xian,&quot; which indicates that they are essentially the same. In later generations, terms such as &quot;dianxian,” &quot;fengxian,&quot; and &quot;fengdian&quot; have emerged, each referring to different conditions, leading to confusion and complexity, which is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Similarly, the &quot;Bielu&quot; records five types of &quot;xian&quot;: horse epilepsy, cattle epilepsy, pig epilepsy, sheep epilepsy, and chicken epilepsy, which correspond to modern terms like sheep &quot;dian&quot; and pig &quot;dian.&quot; These names have been established merely due to phonetic similarity, showing that there is fundamentally only one &quot;dianxian.&quot;</p>
<p>Different schools have added various conditions to distinguish from &quot;dian,&quot; creating unnecessary distinctions. The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; also mentions &quot;fengxian,&quot; &quot;jingxian,&quot; &quot;shixian,&quot; as well as &quot;yinxian&quot; and &quot;yangxian&quot;; all these should be clarified and examined further.</p>
<p>Epilepsy often results from phlegm and qi. Whenever qi is obstructed or phlegm is stagnant, it can block the meridians and impede the heart’s orifices, leading to sudden episodes of dizziness, rigidity, facial drooping, upward eye movement, spasms of limbs, and a stiff spine, often recovering after a short time. This condition that comes and goes is due to the sudden reversal of qi. Therefore, treatment should focus initially on addressing the excess of phlegm and qi. Additionally, the presence or absence of fire should be assessed, and treatment should be aligned with the pulse and symptoms accordingly.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p>
<h3>On Treatment</h3>
<p>For stagnation of Qi, one should use methods such as Qìzhì Drink, Dà Hézhōng Drink, or Sìmó Drink, or similar remedies like Niúhuáng Wán, Sūhé Wán, and Jíchéng Rùnxià Wán. </p>
<p>For excessive phlegm, suitable treatments include Qīnggé Drink, Liù&#39;ān Decoction, Èr Chén Decoction, or Jujube Peel and Pinellia Decoction, or remedies such as Bàolóng Wán and Zhūshā Gǔn Tán Wán. </p>
<p>In cases of phlegm combined with fire, Qīnggé Drink, Zhūshā Ān Shén Wán, and Dànxī Rùnxià Wán should be utilized. If phlegm obstructs the Qi severely, it&#39;s essential to induce vomiting; after which, treatment should be adjusted according to the symptoms. </p>
<p>Epileptic conditions without fire are common. If there is no fire pathogen, it is crucial not to carelessly use cooling herbs, as this could harm the Spleen Qi, leading to the emergence of other conditions. Furthermore, for cases of excessive yin and deficient yang or sudden loss of Qi and blood without phlegm, fire, or Qi reversal symptoms, decoctions like Sì Jūn, Sì Wù, Bāo Zhēn, or Shíquán Dàbǔ, along with warming herbs such as Dried Ginger, Cinnamon, and Prepared Aconite, must be used. One should not dismiss epilepsy as solely resulting from real pathogens and thus entirely prohibit tonic remedies. </p>
<p>In cases where true yin is severely compromised, Qi fails to return to the root, leading to intermittent dullness that is difficult to resolve, the use of Zǐ Hécar Wán is essential for efficacy. For those who are generally weak with some manifest phlegm and fire that isn&#39;t clearing, and have had a prolonged illness without resolution, Jíyàn Lóngnǎo Ān Shén Wán is most appropriate, and adjustments should be made according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>            Treatment of Dementia</p>
<p>Dementia, often characterized by the absence of phlegm, can arise from repression, lack of fulfillment, excessive thinking, doubts, or fears, gradually leading to confusion. Symptoms include twisted speech, unreasonable actions, excessive sweating, or persistent worry. The manifestations are varied and numerous, with pulse often being either taut or rapid, large or small, fluctuating and unstable, indicating a reversal of qi in the heart or the liver and gallbladder meridians, resulting in obstructed qi. If one observes that the body is strong and food intake is not diminished, with no signs of collapse, then the use of Mánjiān&#39;s treatment is highly recommended—it is the most stable and effective remedy. However, some cases are curable while others are not, depending on the strength of the stomach qi and original qi, and recovery should be anticipated in time, not rushed. For symptoms arising from sudden fright or shock that cause loss of mental clarity, it is essential to promptly support the righteous qi, and the use of Qīfú drink or Dàbǔyuán decoction should be prioritized.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescription of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Method</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of epilepsy often arise from Qi deficiency with phlegm, manifesting suddenly like a violent storm, collapsing unexpectedly, with foaming at the mouth and sounds resembling those of cattle or sheep, varying in manifestation. If treated improperly, there may often be fatalities. I now present a formula, named &quot;Phlegm-Dispersing and Epilepsy-Clearing Decoction&quot;, comprising three taels each of ginseng, Fu Shen (Poria), and banxia (Pinellia); five taels each of white atractylodes and white peony; one tael each of licorice, aconite, tangerine peel, and sweet flag (acorus); to be decocted and taken. This formula incorporates ginseng, atractylodes, Fu Shen, and peony—spiritual medicines that invigorate the spleen and soothe the liver. The tangerine peel, banxia, and licorice merely aim to eliminate phlegm and harmonize the center. The brilliance lies in the use of aconite and sweet flag to awaken the mysterious mind, guiding each herb directly into the heart&#39;s orifices. When the heart is clear, the phlegm naturally disperses, thus alleviating epilepsy. It neither exhausts Qi nor blocks the orifices; how can there be fatalities? </p>
<p>Additionally, in cases of sheep epilepsy, where one suddenly collapses, uttering sounds of sheep or horses, and expelling phlegm as if surging, the phlegm confounds the heart orifices, arising from cold and induced by chill. The formula consists of three taels each of ginseng, banxia, and Chinese yam; one liang (six taels) of white atractylodes; five taels each of Fu Shen and job&#39;s tears; and one tael each of cinnamon and aconite, to be decocted and taken.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>This formula helps strengthen the vital energy to nurture the heart and blood, adding cinnamon and prepared aconite to dispel cold evil, and incorporating pinellia to resolve phlegm, naturally allowing the qi to return and stopping the convulsions. One dose can cure completely, never to relapse; it is fortunate to treasure this and not to neglect it! The condition of sheep epilepsy is most common in children, resulting from internal injuries to the spleen and stomach and external invasion of wind and cold, which congeal within the chest. Therefore, whenever wind or cold attacks, the old phlegm reoccurs. Now, using only tonifying and stabilizing herbs, this approach not only alleviates phlegm but also addresses the root of the illness. If one treats with remedies for wind and phlegm, though it may show some efficacy, it ultimately cannot prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>For treating bovine and equine epilepsy, although the treatment is similar to that of sheep epilepsy, the symptoms are distinct. The formula uses three taels of ginseng, five taels of white atractylodes, three qian of dried tangerine peel, one tael each of raw southern star, pinellia, and licorice, with one qian of aconite powdered and mixed into pills with honey. This must be taken before the onset of the illness to ensure it will not come back. The reason is that strengthening the stomach qi will naturally prevent phlegm from forming, especially when assisted by phlegm-dispelling agents. If a person afflicted with sheep epilepsy is also treated with this formula, they will recover as well. If a person’s illness resembles the cries of cattle or horses, it is indeed bovine or equine epilepsy. Generally, sheep epilepsy is more common in children, while bovine and equine epilepsy occurs more frequently in adults.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Prescription for Treating Epilepsy</strong></p>

<p>The aforementioned acupuncture methods for epilepsy are primarily based on the &quot;Neijing,&quot; which mainly references the six channels of the hands and feet: Taiyang, Yangming, and Taiyin. Contemporary texts such as the &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; and others tend to include the Du channel and additional points based on specific symptoms. However, students should prioritize the &quot;Neijing.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica,&quot; for various forms of epilepsy, use moxa on the middle of the Gu, beneath the scrotum, and conduct treatments according to the year&#39;s progression.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding Exercises</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Vital Preservation&quot; states that for guiding exercises related to sheep wind, focus on the navel, imagining it penetrating through the kidneys and rotating. Visualize the kidney water rising to the crown, concentrating on the lower abdomen.</p>
<p>For guiding exercises corresponding to sheep wind, envision the navel dispersing into the four limbs as if passing through barriers. Then, shift focus from the eyes back to the navel; when warmth is felt, rotate left and right, increasing in size, for a total of twenty-seven repetitions throughout the four limbs.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Danxi Heart Method,&quot; it is stated: A woman, aged forty-five, had given birth multiple times and often experienced abdominal pain. She enjoyed drinking three cups of wine every night before sleeping. Her husband was violent and jovial, using alcohol to quell his anger. Suddenly, after the ninth month, she suffered a severe seizure, during which her eyes would roll back, and she would throw her hands and kick her legs vigorously, with all her muscles convulsing. Her throat sounded like a saw, and frothy saliva flowed from both corners of her mouth. This lasted about an hour, and then all symptoms ceased; she appeared to be in deep sleep, completely unaware of her surroundings. After half an hour, she began to feel pain in her lower abdomen, extending up to her heart, and she sweated profusely like rain, with the sweat stopping at her chest. After another half hour, the pain gradually diminished, and the sweating subsided. During the pain, she expressed her discomfort but spoke nonsensically and did not respond to questions, remaining oblivious to her surroundings. When the pain subsided, she returned to deep sleep as before. The seizures and pain alternated without rest for two nights before she finally summoned me to take her pulse. During her pain, the pulse was weak and intermittent, neither firm nor soft, with the left side weaker than the right. I hesitated to give her medication. I waited for her to seize again to observe her condition and pulse. Later, during the onset of another seizure, all six pulses were concealed, except for a strong pulse beneath my fingers. Her eyes were white with a bluish tint, while her face was not discolored, and her hand movements were thrice that of her legs. I asked her that when the pain occurred, she craved heavy pressure, unlike during seizures when she would sweat freely. Her husband confirmed this was indeed the case. I stated: This is not a fatal condition; as long as she can swallow medicine, it can be treated. I tried to administer powdered Xiangfuzi. Just when the seizures seemed to stabilize, she managed to swallow half a cup of the remedy, but before I could prepare bamboo juice, she experienced intense pain again.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>I believe that the liver harbors anger, and due to a deficiency of blood, the qi moves erratically, leading to illness in the spleen. Between the lungs and stomach, there is a pre-existing phlegm from wine that the liver qi suppresses, resulting in pain. However, wine is invigorating and can facilitate movement; when taken internally, it causes pain, and when it escapes outward, it causes convulsions. At the moment of internal movement, one should urgently acupuncture three points: Dadu, Xingjian, and Zhongwan, allowing the heat to disperse simultaneously from the head. One should apply moxibustion on the toes lightly, starting from the abdominal pain and gradually moving down to the waist to stop. After a short period of restful sleep, the convulsions should seem reduced by half. Furthermore, bamboo juice diluted with a little ginger juice should be administered in a large quantity; during the administration, the convulsions should be stable, yet the person still sleeps soundly as before. In this state, the patient is unresponsive, having been unconscious for one day and two nights, all efforts abandoned. I observed that the body does not feel hot, and sweating occurs from the pain. The bowel movement has not occurred for five or six days since I last saw the patient, and there has also been no urination; this is not a sign of imminent death but rather due to insufficient blood and a lack of consciousness. You should relieve the pain in the philtrum (the area above the upper lip), which leads to groaning. I urgently administered a ginseng decoction mixed with bamboo juice, yet the person fell back into the same state of deep sleep.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>I instructed on how to prepare a ginseng and poria paste, mixing it with bamboo juice. After two days and nights of use, with one pound of ginseng and two pounds of poria, the patient’s eyes could suddenly open, and they were able to lift their hands. They reported feeling a fullness in the chest and pain throughout the body, with no hearing or vision restored, and suddenly they wet the bed quite a lot. I was greatly pleased to hear this, and since the seizures and pain had not occurred, I instructed them to use dried tangerine peel, peony root, licorice, and ligusticum in a decoction to mix with the ginseng and poria paste, along with bamboo juice. I wanted to proceed elsewhere and checked the pulse, hearing a sound. Realizing my earlier approach was flawed, I did not instruct them to take congee and medicine alternately but rather urgently prepared thin congee for them. They could only swallow three or four spoonfuls as their jaw was clenched and wouldn’t accept any more. So, I used a wooden wedge to pry open their mouth, introduced the thin congee mixed with the medicinal broth, and also administered a large dose of bamboo juice. The congee was abundant, comprising one-third of the medicinal mixture. I then went out, advising that they continue alternating between congee and medicine. I was twenty miles away when, before the hour of Shen, a strong wind arose. I anticipated that the woman would have a seizure, so I specifically went to check on her. There were no seizures, but the pain had intensified, and the pulse was rapid and erratic. I hastily applied moxibustion to Yangu, Taichong, and Jueque points. After the moxibustion, the pain subsided. When I asked if she wanted congee, she replied, &quot;I am very hungry.&quot;<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>He drank porridge, swallowing two cups. I then went to another place and continued to instruct them to mix medicine with ginseng paste and bamboo sap, administering it as before with the porridge. On the second night, around midnight, I was urgently summoned and went to check on him. His epilepsy was severe, and I couldn&#39;t find the pulse; I had someone support his elbows. Grasping his middle finger, I pressed to feel his pulse. It was strong and forceful, regular in all four positions but slightly slow on the right side. He spoke nonsensically without order; also, he shouted angrily at others, staring without blinking, then vomited. He also desired to rise and run, as if trying to escape. I held both his hands firmly and performed moxibustion on the back of his two thumbs, half an inch from the flesh, three times each. His anger lessened slightly, seeking relief. I asked for a candle to inspect him, but he was still unresponsive in ears and eyes, falling into a deep sleep until midnight, when he became frenzied again, speaking of ghosts and monsters, and when the shaman arrived, he cursed at them.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>I contemplated deeply. The Qi is weak due to blood deficiency, which allows external pathogenic influences to invade. There may indeed be a reason for this. Moreover, with tonic medicine, if the blood and Qi are replenished, the pathogens will naturally recede. I maintained the previous prescriptions. I feared the phlegm was stubborn, so I added Jingjie and Lihuo; I also used the moxibustion technique of Qin Chengzu to treat it, hoping it would send the ailment away. After a day and night of deep sleep, the patient suddenly got up, asking for porridge. Upon seeing the patient, the husband remarked that their face was soiled and wondered why there was a fragrance in the room. The patient then seemed unaware of anything else, merely opening their eyes without sleeping. Though their hands and feet could move, they wandered aimlessly. This continued for another two days and nights. The porridge intake increased slightly, but they still wet the bed as before. I became even more optimistic and continued with the previous medication. I then went to another place. The following evening, I was suddenly summoned back urgently to check on the patient, who claimed to be in pain all over. Taking the pulse, I found it was evenly moderate in both sides. They said: &quot;The ginseng and atracarya have all been used up.&quot; I then advised them to add ginseng and atracarya decoction to the previous prescription, remove the Jingjie, and add powdered Xiangfu instead. After one dose, the patient felt greatly relieved.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>I instructed to keep watch over this medicine. By the next midnight, they came urgently to report that the pain had intensified. I went to check on them. They were sitting on a bucket, screaming loudly. I thought this was a case of a deficiency illness accompanied by excessive sweating, with a dry intestine making it difficult to pass stool. The pain seemed to be in the lower abdomen and waist, so I quickly applied a large piece of amber ointment to their lower abdomen and instructed them to rub warm hands between their waist and kidneys, and as they were able to breathe out, the pain eased, and they fell asleep for a short while, repeating this five or six times. One physician advised using a laxative. I replied, &quot;Which is worse, pain or death? If they endure until after midnight, it will resolve on its own.&quot; I then went to another place. By the fourth watch of the night, they came urgently again to report that the pain had intensified. I went to check on them; the pain was excruciating. I instructed them to sit in warm water, which would help relieve it. After changing the water, the pain steadied, and they felt much better. In the second bucket of water, they passed two solid stools and then fell asleep. At dawn, I went to another place again. In the evening, they reported an urgent issue once more. I checked, and the pain was severe, radiating to both sides, making it impossible to get close to them.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>I thought about this; the pain had no apparent cause. If there were leftover feces, the pain would be in the lower abdomen, but now it is in the upper abdomen, so it must be due to overeating. Upon questioning, it was confirmed. The physician wanted to use a remedy known as &quot;Ganying Pill,&quot; but I instructed not to give congee or medicinal broth. The patient insisted on having medicine, so I gave them powdered xiangfu to lick. By midnight, the pain gradually reduced, and by dawn, they felt slightly hungry for congee. I said, &quot;It is not hunger, but rather a gurgling in your ears; do not eat and find peace.&quot; However, their family still gave them congee. By mid-morning, I went to other places; by evening, the pain returned, and the patient persistently requested xiangfu powder. Eventually, I mixed half a bowl with broth for them and checked to make them vomit; there was still undigested food, and the pain stopped. I went to other places again, and by midnight, they reported that the pain recurred. Upon inquiry, I advised them to eat congee mixed with vinegar and radish sprouts and also to use the xiangfu powder to induce vomiting, which resolved the pain. I instructed them not to eat anything for a full day and the next day to have a little light congee. When they felt hungry, to take Chenpi broth with Baizhu pills, and in this way, they could regulate themselves and find peace.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A woman suffered from epilepsy since she was six or seven years old due to a shock. Over the next few years, her condition fluctuated, becoming increasingly severe by the time she reached thirty to forty years of age, with daily episodes sometimes exceeding ten. This led to confusion and forgetfulness, and she wished for death. During a great famine in the years of Xinding, she started gathering wild herbs to eat. Near the water, she found a kind of grass resembling green onions, which she boiled and ate. After eating it, around dawn, she felt uneasy and vomited a thick saliva for several consecutive days, producing around one or two dou. She sweated profusely. Initially, she felt drowsy, but after three days, she felt lighter and healthier, unlike before. Her illness had receded, and her appetite improved; all her pulses were balanced. Not knowing what she had eaten, she inquired of others and found out it was scallion shoots. The scallion shoots referred to here correspond to what the &quot;Bencao&quot; calls lily bulb shoots. The &quot;Tujing&quot; states that lily bulb shoots can treat wind ailments. This was merely a chance discovery of a remedy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Wanbing Huichun&quot; mentions: Wang Dashen&#39;s heir, at eighteen, suffered from epilepsy, collapsing to the ground when it struck, unable to recognize anything, and after a while, would revive. He experienced episodes once a month or four or five times in two months, and for seven years, various doctors failed to help. I diagnosed his six pulses as slippery and rapid, with a strong pulse at Renyin. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood, accompanied by phlegm and wind stagnation. I prescribed a formula of Qufeng Quzhen Wan, adding one ounce each of ginseng, angelica, and coptis, along with Anshen Wan to be taken together. In less than six months, he was cured. Subsequently, several others with similar conditions were treated, and all recovered.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>A young boy, fifteen years old, after being involved with women, resumed labor, but failed in his examinations and suffered from epilepsy for three years. His seizures were triggered by work. He was treated with &quot;Shiquan Dabu&quot; and &quot;Jiawei Guipi&quot; formulas, along with grindings of purple river vehicle mixed in steamed glutinous rice to form pills the size of a sycamore seed. He took a hundred pills each time, three to five times a day, and was cured. Later, he experienced nocturnal emissions and sweating with fever, so he continued using the previous remedies along with &quot;Liuwwei Wan&quot; and recovered. This prescription for epilepsy is effective regardless of gender or age.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases&quot; states: The wife of Lord Honglu had a history of epilepsy, which would occur when she was laboring or felt anger, and it would take her a long time to regain her senses. One day, after improper labor following a meal, she had a seizure and was unable to speak for half a day. Some attributed it to wind invading the organs and prescribed agents to dispel wind, resolve phlegm, and regulate qi, as well as Niuhuang Qingxin Wan, but her condition worsened. Her six pulses were floating and strong, but her two inches were deficient, yet she continued to eat and drink. I said: This is harm to the spleen and stomach qi. If it were wind invading the organs, it would be easily remedied. She did not believe it and continued with the wind remedies, which eventually led to her demise.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　大抵癫痫之发，由肾中阴火上逆，而肝从之，故作搐搦。搐搦则遍身之脂液促迫而气上逆，吐出于口也。然肾间动气乃生气之原，肾伤则志不足，故神躁扰，火逆上，攻动其痰而厥也。或经脉引入外邪，内伤深入，伤其生气之原，邪正混乱，天枢不发，卫气固留于阴而不行，不行则阴气蓄满，郁极乃发，发则命门之相火，自下逆上，填塞其窍，惟迫出其如羊鸣者一二声而已。遍身之脂液，脾之涎沫，皆迫而上胸臆，流出于口，五脏六腑十二经脉，皆不胜其冲逆，故卒倒而不知入也。食顷，火气退散乃醒。若生气未复，则余邪渐炽而复作也。然所谓生气之原者，乃有生之初，先生此而外通于脐而系胞，随母呼吸，若母受惊，气混于其中，久之乃成。命门即脐下肾间一点真阳是也。复被外邪则发作也。如此则生命之原为邪所害，自小目瞪质弱，必不长寿。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>

<p>　　　　　痫病论证</p>
<p>　　癫，即痫也。观《内经》言癫甚详，而痫则无辨，即此可知。后世有癫痫、风痫、风癫等名，所指不一，则徒滋惑乱，不必然也。又如《别录》所载五痫，曰马痫、牛痫、猪痫、羊痫、鸡痫者，即今人之谓羊癫、猪癫也。此不过因其声之相似，遂立此名。可见癫痫无二，而诸家于癫证之外，又有痫证，诚属牵强，无足凭也。又《千金方》有风痫、惊痫、食痫及阴痫、阳痫之说，皆所当辨，并列后条。　　癫病多由痰气。凡气有所逆，痰有所滞，皆能壅闭经络，格塞心窍，故发则旋晕僵仆，口眼相引，目睛上视，手足搐搦，腰脊强直，食顷乃苏。此倏病倏已者，由气之倏逆倏顺也。故治此当察痰察气之甚者而先治之。至若火之有无，又当审其脉证而兼为之治也。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　气滞者，宜排气饮、大和中饮、四磨饮，或牛黄丸、苏合丸、集成润下丸之类主之。　　痰盛者，宜清膈饮、六安煎、二陈汤、橘皮半夏汤或抱龙丸、朱砂滚痰丸之类主之。　　痰兼火者，宜清膈饮、朱砂安神丸、丹溪润下丸之类主之。痰逆气滞甚者，必用吐法，吐后随证调理之。　　癫痫证无火者多。若无火邪，不得妄用凉药，恐伤脾气以致变生他证。且复有阴盛阳衰，及气血暴脱，而绝无痰火气逆等病者，则凡四君、四物、八珍、十全大补等汤，或干姜、桂、附之类，皆所必用，不得谓癫痫尽属实邪，而概禁补剂也。若真阴大损，气不归根，而时作时止，昏沉难愈者，必用紫河车丸方可奏效。　　其有虚中挟实，微兼痰火不清，而病久不愈者，集验龙脑安神丸最得其宜，随证增减，可为法也。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>　　　　　痴呆证治</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>[Note: The two yin refer to Shaoyin. Epileptic seizures occur when water Qi ascends to the heart, hence the urgency of the two yin pulse.] The heart pulse is full and large, with spasms and convulsions; the liver pulse is small and rapid, also with spasms and convulsions. [Note: This indicates a deficiency of the liver and coldness preventing nourishment to the sinews, resulting in convulsions.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Spirit Pivot, Chapter on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The bladder meridian of the Foot Taiyang is responsible for diseases originating in the sinews, such as hemorrhoids, malaria, and epilepsy. [Note: When the meridians reverse at the lower body, it results in epilepsy and mania.]**</p>
<p><strong>From the Thousand Gold Prescriptions (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>There are five types of mania: the first is Yang mania, which occurs when the patient appears dead, experiences incontinence, and may relieve themselves after a while; the second is Yin mania, which occurs in individuals sitting for long periods with unhealed umbilical sores and due to frequent bathing; the third is Wind mania, where symptoms include eye movements, strong pulls, goat-like bleating, and relief after eating, often induced by laboring in the wind or excessive sexual activity, leading to heart Qi being forced, causing shortness of breath and palpitations; the fourth is Damp mania, characterized by pain in the forehead, a heavy body, sauna use, dampness affecting the brain, and occurs particularly when sweating has not ceased; the fifth is Horse mania, where symptoms include rolling eyes, locked jaws, body warmth, and onset while sitting with excessive wind disturbance leading to brain heat imbalance. [Note: This pertains to epilepsy, which has been classified among similar conditions by previous scholars. The manifestations of epilepsy differ, yet the underlying causes are the same, thus they are now categorized this way.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

According to the &quot;Bielu&quot; (Separate Records), there are five types of epilepsy: the first is &quot;horse epilepsy,&quot; characterized by neighing and related to the heart; the second is &quot;sheep epilepsy,&quot; characterized by bleating and related to the spleen; the third is &quot;chicken epilepsy,&quot; characterized by crowing and related to the stomach; the fourth is &quot;pig epilepsy,&quot; characterized by grunting and related to the kidneys; and the fifth is &quot;cow epilepsy,&quot; characterized by mooing and related to the lungs. These five types of epilepsy correspond to five livestock animals and their respective five organs.</p>
<p>In episodes, there occur sudden dizziness, involuntary movements of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyes, twitching of the hands and feet, rigidity of the back, and a return to awareness after a while. The cause is often due to a disturbance in the vital energy of the organs resulting from shock, leading to the generation of phlegm and blockage of the meridians, thus producing these symptoms. The causes may stem from fear experienced in the womb, from exposure to wind, cold, heat, or dampness in infancy, or from inappropriate eating habits which disrupt the vital energy.</p>
<p>For those suffering from epilepsy, particularly those under ten years of age, it is generally classified as epilepsy. The origins of the episodes can typically be categorized into three types: wind-related, shock-related, and food-related epilepsy. These three types can manifest as various forms of epilepsy. If not treated promptly, they may develop into chronic conditions. The manifestations occur suddenly with involuntary movements of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyes, or twitching of the hands and feet, along with stiffness of the back, bending of the neck, or shaking of the head and tongue movements. During a seizure, one should not restrain the person, as holding them can lead to dislocation and hinder their movements.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>Epilepsy does not manifest with eyes wide open like a fool; it can be treated with the Three Saint Powder. Additionally, prepare a large basin in a warm room to induce sweating and expel through three methods simultaneously, then take the Tong Sheng Powder. After a hundred days, one will recover. However, if the eyes are wide and look foolish, it cannot be treated. The Inner Classic states: “When the spirit cannot be preserved, it means the spirit is chaotic.” Generally, when wind-induced epilepsy occurs, the neck stiffens and one stares blankly, showing a loss of awareness; this indicates heat in the liver meridian. If there is teeth grinding, first use a bitter decoction of celery to expel it; after expulsion, one can take the Xie Qing Pill. Afterwards, use the modified Tong Sheng Powder. In clear cases of teeth grinding, using the Dao Chi Powder will lead to recovery. If a seizure occurs, one may use light powder, white alunite, Mongolian stone, and red lead stone; once recovered, adjust with rice drink.

<p>For cases of shock and phlegm, it is advisable to induce vomiting, primarily focusing on phlegm. Use Huang Lian, Nan Xing, (Caoshe) Lou, and Ban Xia, seeking to eliminate phlegm in varying amounts. All can be cured through this method.

After inducing vomiting, take Dongyuan Anshen Pill. The main method should be to vomit, and afterwards use liver-soothing medicines such as Qing Dai, Chai Hu, and Chuan Xiong, with Longhui Pill being particularly suitable.</p>
<p>In cases where epilepsy is caused by shock, the spirit fails to reside properly, leading to phlegm accumulation. There are five types of epilepsy: horse, cow, chicken, pig, and sheep. For instance, horse epilepsy shows mouth opening and head shaking with neighing; cow epilepsy presents with eyes staring straight and abdominal distension; chicken epilepsy involves head shaking and a tendency to be startled; sheep epilepsy is characterized by uplifted eyes and tongue protrusion; pig epilepsy often leads to excessive salivation. All these conditions are merely different manifestations of phlegm obstructing the orifices, causing a disorienting state leading to symptoms like dizziness, convulsions of the limbs, facial and body rigidity, excessive shouting, salivation, and recovery shortly after eating.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Overview</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, or &quot;dizziness of the head,&quot; occurs when phlegm is present in the diaphragm, causing mild dizziness that does not lead to fainting. When phlegm overflows above the diaphragm, it results in severe dizziness that leads to falling to the ground, without awareness of one&#39;s surroundings; this condition is termed epilepsy. Xu Sibao states that adults refer to it as &quot;epilepsy,&quot; while children refer to it simply as &quot;convulsions,&quot; though it is essentially one disease. However, it differs from conditions like windstroke, cold stroke, heatstroke, and rage fainting. In the case of epilepsy, during an episode, sounds are emitted from the mouth, with the possibility of foaming at the mouth, followed by a period of unconsciousness before experiencing another episode. In contrast, conditions such as windstroke, cold stroke, heatstroke, and rage fainting typically occur silently, without foam during fainting, and do not recur after unconsciousness, though some may have infrequent episodes, they are not like the frequent occurrences in epilepsy.</p>
<p>To treat the condition, for those with hidden, strong pulses and experiencing convulsive episodes with signs of fury or heat, perform moxibustion on the third and ninth vertebrae and administer a special herbal remedy known as the &quot;Magical Fragrance Pill,&quot; prepared by puncturing a small hole in a gourd, soaking it in cold water for a short time, and taking it as prescribed. For those with thin and weak pulses exhibiting convulsions resembling madness, use the &quot;Li Henan Five-Ming Pill.&quot; </p>
<p>For chronic cases of wind epilepsy that do not respond to treatment, augment the &quot;Thick Bark Pill&quot; with additional ingredients during spring and autumn, and add 1.5 taels of ginseng, calamus, and poria to each dosage, mixing well before consumption.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Epilepsy, as well as conditions like stroke, chills, heat stroke, dampness, qi blockage, and corpse blockage that lead to dizziness and fainting, all arise from evil qi rebelling upwards and disturbing the head. In the case of epilepsy, it is phlegm evil that rises. Conditions like stroke from cold, heat, dampness, and qi blockage also involve similar evil qi rising. When evil qi rises, the qi in the head becomes chaotic; when the qi in the head is disordered, the vessels become obstructed, and the apertures do not function, leading to a lack of awareness, failure to recognize sounds or people, and ultimately fainting to the ground. Since the disease affects the top of the head, it is called epilepsy. Treatments may involve expelling phlegm to address the disturbance or suppressing it, managing phlegm to prevent qi from rising, using light dispersing techniques for wind, cold, heat, and dampness, or employing acupuncture to guide qi through the vessels in the head, all of which can restore the flow in the vessels at the top of the head and open the apertures, preventing dizziness. Thus, it is understood that the disorder of epilepsy, associated with qi tumult in the head, is indeed a singular condition. Wang Taifu mistakenly divided epilepsy into two diseases, but only Master Sun was able to recognize it as one. Hence, this discussion on the tumultuous qi of the head is specifically placed at the beginning of the chapter on epilepsy to help people understand the disease&#39;s nature and its proper treatment.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p>Epilepsy resembles madness, but epilepsy occurs intermittently and affects the five organs, whereas madness persists for a long time and primarily attacks the heart. </p>
<p><strong>The Disease is Just Phlegm</strong></p>
<p>The internal injury is most common, while external causes are quite rare. The injury from food and drink accumulates, forming phlegm-fire that obstructs the mind. Fear, anxiety, and anger exacerbate the fire, leading to the spirit losing its home, leaving it empty and filled with phlegm. Danxi states: Epilepsy arises from phlegm obstructing the heart&#39;s pathways; it manifests as sudden dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsions in the limbs, facial distortions, rigidity of the chest and back, shouting, and foaming at the mouth, with recovery following shortly after. When the illness begins with body heat and a floating pulse, it is yang epilepsy related to the six fu organs and is easy to treat. When it begins with body cold and a sinking pulse, it is yin epilepsy related to the five zang organs and is difficult to treat. If the spirit appears drained and the eyes are wide open, resembling foolishness, it is untreatable.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Five Types of Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, when prolonged, must return to the five organs. Liver epilepsy results in a pale face, head shaking, startled expressions, and mimicking a rooster&#39;s crow. Heart epilepsy leads to a flushed face, open mouth, head shaking, and sounds like a horse neighing. Spleen epilepsy presents with a yellow face, diarrhea, tongue protrusion, and bleating like a sheep. Lung epilepsy is characterized by a white face, foaming at the mouth, abdominal bloating, and sounds like a cow. Kidney epilepsy involves a dark face, staring like a corpse, and emitting sounds like a pig. These five epilepsy symptoms are merely classifications. In reality, they stem from phlegm, fire, and fright.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm, Fire, and Fright</strong></p>
<p>Obese individuals tend to have more phlegm, which makes noise and froths when they move. For wind phlegm, use a decoction containing three pieces of scorpion mixed with star anise and ginger. Alternatively, there are Fengfeng Quphlegm pills or Wusheng pills. For fright-induced phlegm, use Zishi powder, Jingqi pills, Baolong pills, or Sanxian pills. To calm the spirit, use Shendan or Shouxing pills. If caused by anger, use Shunqi Daotan soup with sweet flag and cinnabar; if due to worry, use Miaoxiang powder. For food phlegm, utilize Xiaoping powder. For thin individuals with excessive fire and a flushed face, consider Fangfeng Danggui decoction, or Minzhong soup with Nanshen, or various pills including Gunphlegm, Xieqing, Niuhuang Qingxin pills, Longnao Anshen pills, or Qianjin Longdan soup. If both phlegm and fire are excessive, use Zhi Xin pills, taking with warm wine to expel stubborn old phlegm. Common remedies include Duanxian pills, Huohufei pills, Bianfu powder, Siyan pills, and Zijindan.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Method</h3>
<p>Epilepsy is fundamentally caused by phlegm-heat combined with shock, thus cooling remedies to clear the heart, reduce fire, and transform phlegm should be the primary focus. Therefore, ancient treatments used Erchen Decoction combined with (herbs) such as Chuan Bei Mu, Nanshen, and Huang Lian to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one must take Zhushay Anshen Wan to reduce southern fire, and Da Ai Long Hui Wan to balance the eastern wood. However, to transform phlegm, one must first regulate the qi; to regulate qi, one must first adjust the middle. If phlegm is stubbornly adhesive, how can it be guided without the aid of pungent and warm remedies? Hence, ancient methods for treating epilepsy all used warming agents. For instance, Qian Zhongyang treated childhood epilepsy; after inducing vomiting and diarrhea, and having consumed too many cooling medicines, the body became cold, eyes closed, and appetite ceased. Later, he used Yihuang San to replenish the center, enabling the child to eat, and then administered Shenqi Wan to replenish northern kidney water so that speech could return. This should be done prudently to rescue the severe symptoms of epilepsy and can be considered an effective method.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

To treat it, there is no need to differentiate into five types; one should expel phlegm and soothe the qi, clear heat, and pacify the liver, using herbs like Huanglian, (Cao) Lou, Nánxīng, and Bànxià, adjusting the amounts as needed, ensuring effective treatment. For those with heat, cool herbs should cleanse the heart; phlegm must be resolved through purging methods, followed by calming remedies like Dongyuan Anshen Pill, along with liver-pacifying herbs such as Qingdai, Chaihu, and Chuanxiong.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medicine&#39;s Essential Guidelines: Six Key Points</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)</strong><br><strong>General Overview</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the occurrence of epilepsy arises from the upward rebellion of the yin fire within the kidneys, which then affects the liver, leading to convulsions. When convulsions occur, the body&#39;s fluids are forced upwards, causing the qi to rise and be expelled from the mouth. The movement of qi within the kidneys is the origin of vitality; if the kidneys are weakened, the determination wanes, resulting in a disturbed spirit, rebellious fire, and an attack on phlegm, leading to convulsions. Sometimes, external pathogens invade through the meridians, causing deep internal injuries that damage the origin of life energy. This results in chaos between the pathogenic and healthy forces, obstructing the flow of qi at the Tian Shu point. The defensive qi remains trapped in the yin, unable to circulate. When circulation is hindered, the yin qi accumulates, and when it reaches extreme levels, it manifests, causing the fire of the life gate to rise from below and block the orifices, resulting in only a few utterances resembling a sheep&#39;s bleat. The body’s fluids, along with the spleen&#39;s saliva, surge up to the chest and are expelled through the mouth. The five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians cannot withstand this upward pressure, thus leading to sudden loss of consciousness. After eating, when the fire dissipates, the person regains awareness. If the life energy has not yet returned, the remaining evil will gradually intensify and reoccur. The so-called origin of life energy refers to that which exists in the beginning of life; it commences with a connection to the navel and is linked to the fetus, following the mother&#39;s breathing. If the mother experiences shock, the qi becomes muddled, and over time, this leads to issues. The life gate is simply the true yang point below the navel within the kidneys. If it is again attacked by external pathogens, it will manifest. In this way, if the origin of life is harmed by evil, the individual will appear frail and weak, ensuring a short lifespan.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong>  </p>
<p>Epilepsy and convulsive stroke are similar, but in epilepsy, the person falls with sounds from the mouth, produces saliva when awakening, and after waking, may relapse. Some have repeated episodes over several days, while others may have three to five episodes in a single day. In strokes, caused by wind, cold, or heat, the person falls silently, has no saliva upon waking, and does not relapse after waking. Although convulsions also come and go, the body is rigid and may arch like a bow, unlike epilepsy where the body is soft, and it may produce sounds similar to those of pigs, dogs, cattle, or sheep. </p>
<p>The &quot;Original Disease Formulas&quot; indicate that excessive heat can lead to wind, combined with dryness, causing excessive saliva in the chest and diaphragm, resulting in symptoms like confusion, stiffness, and falling. The &quot;Three Causes&quot; suggest that an internal imbalance due to shock can lead to saliva production, blocking the meridians, which results in fainting; this can occur from fright while in the womb, exposure to the six pathogenic factors, or irregular eating, which may go against the internal energy. Thus, the causes differ—those obtained externally through improper qi and those internally through fear, along with diet-related issues belonging to both inner and outer influences. The different causes require different treatment methods.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those who are startled, the Calm Spirit Pill can stabilize them. For those with phlegm, the Three Sacred Powder can induce vomiting. For those with heat, the Clear Spirit Decoction can cool them. If there is a need to purge, then the Chengqi Decoction can be used.</p>
<p>When the hair is ruffled at dawn, it pertains to the foot Shao Yang; in the morning, it relates to the foot Jue Yin; at midday, it corresponds to the foot Tai Yang; at dusk, it associates with the foot Tai Yin; when one is settled, it connects to the foot Yang Ming; when one is awake at midnight, it pertains to the foot Shao Yin. In decoctions, each should add guiding herbs.</p>
<p>Liu Zonghou said: Yin and Yang seizures are akin to sudden shock, with Yang seizures not caused by vomiting or purging, arising instead from phlegm and heat lingering between the heart and stomach, triggered by a loud startle. If heat is vigorous, even without a startle, it can manifest on its own. Cold herbs should be used to attack and treat it. Yin seizures also originate from phlegm-heat. If treated excessively with cold and cooling methods, it harms the spleen and stomach, transforming into Yin conditions. It is advisable to use warm, balanced herbs to tonify and dry phlegm for treatment. If one argues there is a distinction of Yin and Yang without bad syndromes, it refers to the phlegm-heat affecting the organs and their depth. Can it be said that seizure disorders inherently stem from Yin cold?<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Discussion of Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy, referred to as &quot;dian,&quot; is indeed related to &quot;xian.&quot; The &quot;Neijing&quot; discusses &quot;dian&quot; in great detail, while there is no clear distinction made for &quot;xian,&quot; which indicates that they are essentially the same. In later generations, terms such as &quot;dianxian,” &quot;fengxian,&quot; and &quot;fengdian&quot; have emerged, each referring to different conditions, leading to confusion and complexity, which is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Similarly, the &quot;Bielu&quot; records five types of &quot;xian&quot;: horse epilepsy, cattle epilepsy, pig epilepsy, sheep epilepsy, and chicken epilepsy, which correspond to modern terms like sheep &quot;dian&quot; and pig &quot;dian.&quot; These names have been established merely due to phonetic similarity, showing that there is fundamentally only one &quot;dianxian.&quot;</p>
<p>Different schools have added various conditions to distinguish from &quot;dian,&quot; creating unnecessary distinctions. The &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot; also mentions &quot;fengxian,&quot; &quot;jingxian,&quot; &quot;shixian,&quot; as well as &quot;yinxian&quot; and &quot;yangxian&quot;; all these should be clarified and examined further.</p>
<p>Epilepsy often results from phlegm and qi. Whenever qi is obstructed or phlegm is stagnant, it can block the meridians and impede the heart’s orifices, leading to sudden episodes of dizziness, rigidity, facial drooping, upward eye movement, spasms of limbs, and a stiff spine, often recovering after a short time. This condition that comes and goes is due to the sudden reversal of qi. Therefore, treatment should focus initially on addressing the excess of phlegm and qi. Additionally, the presence or absence of fire should be assessed, and treatment should be aligned with the pulse and symptoms accordingly.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Treatment</h3>
<p>For stagnation of Qi, one should use methods such as Qìzhì Drink, Dà Hézhōng Drink, or Sìmó Drink, or similar remedies like Niúhuáng Wán, Sūhé Wán, and Jíchéng Rùnxià Wán. </p>
<p>For excessive phlegm, suitable treatments include Qīnggé Drink, Liù&#39;ān Decoction, Èr Chén Decoction, or Jujube Peel and Pinellia Decoction, or remedies such as Bàolóng Wán and Zhūshā Gǔn Tán Wán. </p>
<p>In cases of phlegm combined with fire, Qīnggé Drink, Zhūshā Ān Shén Wán, and Dànxī Rùnxià Wán should be utilized. If phlegm obstructs the Qi severely, it&#39;s essential to induce vomiting; after which, treatment should be adjusted according to the symptoms. </p>
<p>Epileptic conditions without fire are common. If there is no fire pathogen, it is crucial not to carelessly use cooling herbs, as this could harm the Spleen Qi, leading to the emergence of other conditions. Furthermore, for cases of excessive yin and deficient yang or sudden loss of Qi and blood without phlegm, fire, or Qi reversal symptoms, decoctions like Sì Jūn, Sì Wù, Bāo Zhēn, or Shíquán Dàbǔ, along with warming herbs such as Dried Ginger, Cinnamon, and Prepared Aconite, must be used. One should not dismiss epilepsy as solely resulting from real pathogens and thus entirely prohibit tonic remedies. </p>
<p>In cases where true yin is severely compromised, Qi fails to return to the root, leading to intermittent dullness that is difficult to resolve, the use of Zǐ Hécar Wán is essential for efficacy. For those who are generally weak with some manifest phlegm and fire that isn&#39;t clearing, and have had a prolonged illness without resolution, Jíyàn Lóngnǎo Ān Shén Wán is most appropriate, and adjustments should be made according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

The manifestations are varied and numerous, with pulse often being either taut or rapid, large or small, fluctuating and unstable, indicating a reversal of qi in the heart or the liver and gallbladder meridians, resulting in obstructed qi. If one observes that the body is strong and food intake is not diminished, with no signs of collapse, then the use of Mánjiān&#39;s treatment is highly recommended—it is the most stable and effective remedy. However, some cases are curable while others are not, depending on the strength of the stomach qi and original qi, and recovery should be anticipated in time, not rushed. For symptoms arising from sudden fright or shock that cause loss of mental clarity, it is essential to promptly support the righteous qi, and the use of Qīfú drink or Dàbǔyuán decoction should be prioritized.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescription of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo of the Qing Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Method</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of epilepsy often arise from Qi deficiency with phlegm, manifesting suddenly like a violent storm, collapsing unexpectedly, with foaming at the mouth and sounds resembling those of cattle or sheep, varying in manifestation. If treated improperly, there may often be fatalities. I now present a formula, named &quot;Phlegm-Dispersing and Epilepsy-Clearing Decoction&quot;, comprising three taels each of ginseng, Fu Shen (Poria), and banxia (Pinellia); five taels each of white atractylodes and white peony; one tael each of licorice, aconite, tangerine peel, and sweet flag (acorus); to be decocted and taken. This formula incorporates ginseng, atractylodes, Fu Shen, and peony—spiritual medicines that invigorate the spleen and soothe the liver. The tangerine peel, banxia, and licorice merely aim to eliminate phlegm and harmonize the center. The brilliance lies in the use of aconite and sweet flag to awaken the mysterious mind, guiding each herb directly into the heart&#39;s orifices. When the heart is clear, the phlegm naturally disperses, thus alleviating epilepsy. It neither exhausts Qi nor blocks the orifices; how can there be fatalities? </p>
<p>Additionally, in cases of sheep epilepsy, where one suddenly collapses, uttering sounds of sheep or horses, and expelling phlegm as if surging, the phlegm confounds the heart orifices, arising from cold and induced by chill. The formula consists of three taels each of ginseng, banxia, and Chinese yam; one liang (six taels) of white atractylodes; five taels each of Fu Shen and job&#39;s tears; and one tael each of cinnamon and aconite, to be decocted and taken.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This formula helps strengthen the vital energy to nurture the heart and blood, adding cinnamon and prepared aconite to dispel cold evil, and incorporating pinellia to resolve phlegm, naturally allowing the qi to return and stopping the convulsions. One dose can cure completely, never to relapse; it is fortunate to treasure this and not to neglect it! The condition of sheep epilepsy is most common in children, resulting from internal injuries to the spleen and stomach and external invasion of wind and cold, which congeal within the chest. Therefore, whenever wind or cold attacks, the old phlegm reoccurs. Now, using only tonifying and stabilizing herbs, this approach not only alleviates phlegm but also addresses the root of the illness. If one treats with remedies for wind and phlegm, though it may show some efficacy, it ultimately cannot prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>For treating bovine and equine epilepsy, although the treatment is similar to that of sheep epilepsy, the symptoms are distinct. The formula uses three taels of ginseng, five taels of white atractylodes, three qian of dried tangerine peel, one tael each of raw southern star, pinellia, and licorice, with one qian of aconite powdered and mixed into pills with honey. This must be taken before the onset of the illness to ensure it will not come back. The reason is that strengthening the stomach qi will naturally prevent phlegm from forming, especially when assisted by phlegm-dispelling agents. If a person afflicted with sheep epilepsy is also treated with this formula, they will recover as well. If a person’s illness resembles the cries of cattle or horses, it is indeed bovine or equine epilepsy. Generally, sheep epilepsy is more common in children, while bovine and equine epilepsy occurs more frequently in adults.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

Jinmen and Pucan are for epilepsy and horse epilepsy. Sizhuikong and Tonggu are for wind epilepsy, with excessive salivation and anxiety. Lieque is for heat epilepsy, associated with shock and visions. Tianjing and Xiaohai are for sheep epilepsy, with symptoms including tongue vomiting and sheep-like cries. Xuanli and Shugu are for interlinked epilepsy, good for sudden cries similar to sheep. The &quot;Medical Fundamentals&quot; states that for daytime seizures, treat the Yang Qiao and Shenmai meridians at the depression beneath the outer ankle, where the toenail meets the white flesh. For nighttime seizures, treat the Yin Qiao and Zhaohai meridians at the depression beneath the inner ankle. First, cauterize both meridians with seven intensities each, then take medicine. For all seizures, one must first clear the blockage before cauterizing; otherwise, it can obstruct the qi, which may be fatal. Acupuncture is flexible. Another method: take the Jiuwei point, inserting the needle must be done with caution, but cauterization is preferable, though not excessively strong, as it may cause memory loss. Additionally, take points like Houxi, Yangjiao, Sanli, Taichong, and Jianshi. For wind epilepsy and heart wind disturbance, select Shangguan and Sanli. For Tian Tian point, apply at Jueque, three inches from Baihui, and Huanmen.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Danxi Heart Method,&quot; it is stated: A woman, aged forty-five, had given birth multiple times and often experienced abdominal pain. She enjoyed drinking three cups of wine every night before sleeping. Her husband was violent and jovial, using alcohol to quell his anger. Suddenly, after the ninth month, she suffered a severe seizure, during which her eyes would roll back, and she would throw her hands and kick her legs vigorously, with all her muscles convulsing. Her throat sounded like a saw, and frothy saliva flowed from both corners of her mouth. This lasted about an hour, and then all symptoms ceased; she appeared to be in deep sleep, completely unaware of her surroundings. After half an hour, she began to feel pain in her lower abdomen, extending up to her heart, and she sweated profusely like rain, with the sweat stopping at her chest. After another half hour, the pain gradually diminished, and the sweating subsided. During the pain, she expressed her discomfort but spoke nonsensically and did not respond to questions, remaining oblivious to her surroundings. When the pain subsided, she returned to deep sleep as before. The seizures and pain alternated without rest for two nights before she finally summoned me to take her pulse. During her pain, the pulse was weak and intermittent, neither firm nor soft, with the left side weaker than the right. I hesitated to give her medication. I waited for her to seize again to observe her condition and pulse. Later, during the onset of another seizure, all six pulses were concealed, except for a strong pulse beneath my fingers. Her eyes were white with a bluish tint, while her face was not discolored, and her hand movements were thrice that of her legs. I asked her that when the pain occurred, she craved heavy pressure, unlike during seizures when she would sweat freely. Her husband confirmed this was indeed the case. I stated: This is not a fatal condition; as long as she can swallow medicine, it can be treated. I tried to administer powdered Xiangfuzi. Just when the seizures seemed to stabilize, she managed to swallow half a cup of the remedy, but before I could prepare bamboo juice, she experienced intense pain again.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I believe that the liver harbors anger, and due to a deficiency of blood, the qi moves erratically, leading to illness in the spleen. Between the lungs and stomach, there is a pre-existing phlegm from wine that the liver qi suppresses, resulting in pain. However, wine is invigorating and can facilitate movement; when taken internally, it causes pain, and when it escapes outward, it causes convulsions. At the moment of internal movement, one should urgently acupuncture three points: Dadu, Xingjian, and Zhongwan, allowing the heat to disperse simultaneously from the head. One should apply moxibustion on the toes lightly, starting from the abdominal pain and gradually moving down to the waist to stop. After a short period of restful sleep, the convulsions should seem reduced by half. Furthermore, bamboo juice diluted with a little ginger juice should be administered in a large quantity; during the administration, the convulsions should be stable, yet the person still sleeps soundly as before. In this state, the patient is unresponsive, having been unconscious for one day and two nights, all efforts abandoned. I observed that the body does not feel hot, and sweating occurs from the pain. The bowel movement has not occurred for five or six days since I last saw the patient, and there has also been no urination; this is not a sign of imminent death but rather due to insufficient blood and a lack of consciousness. You should relieve the pain in the philtrum (the area above the upper lip), which leads to groaning. I urgently administered a ginseng decoction mixed with bamboo juice, yet the person fell back into the same state of deep sleep.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I instructed on how to prepare a ginseng and poria paste, mixing it with bamboo juice. After two days and nights of use, with one pound of ginseng and two pounds of poria, the patient’s eyes could suddenly open, and they were able to lift their hands. They reported feeling a fullness in the chest and pain throughout the body, with no hearing or vision restored, and suddenly they wet the bed quite a lot. I was greatly pleased to hear this, and since the seizures and pain had not occurred, I instructed them to use dried tangerine peel, peony root, licorice, and ligusticum in a decoction to mix with the ginseng and poria paste, along with bamboo juice. I wanted to proceed elsewhere and checked the pulse, hearing a sound. Realizing my earlier approach was flawed, I did not instruct them to take congee and medicine alternately but rather urgently prepared thin congee for them. They could only swallow three or four spoonfuls as their jaw was clenched and wouldn’t accept any more. So, I used a wooden wedge to pry open their mouth, introduced the thin congee mixed with the medicinal broth, and also administered a large dose of bamboo juice. The congee was abundant, comprising one-third of the medicinal mixture. I then went out, advising that they continue alternating between congee and medicine. I was twenty miles away when, before the hour of Shen, a strong wind arose. I anticipated that the woman would have a seizure, so I specifically went to check on her. There were no seizures, but the pain had intensified, and the pulse was rapid and erratic. I hastily applied moxibustion to Yangu, Taichong, and Jueque points. After the moxibustion, the pain subsided. When I asked if she wanted congee, she replied, &quot;I am very hungry.&quot;<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

He spoke nonsensically without order; also, he shouted angrily at others, staring without blinking, then vomited. He also desired to rise and run, as if trying to escape.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I contemplated deeply. The Qi is weak due to blood deficiency, which allows external pathogenic influences to invade. There may indeed be a reason for this. Moreover, with tonic medicine, if the blood and Qi are replenished, the pathogens will naturally recede. I maintained the previous prescriptions. I feared the phlegm was stubborn, so I added Jingjie and Lihuo; I also used the moxibustion technique of Qin Chengzu to treat it, hoping it would send the ailment away. After a day and night of deep sleep, the patient suddenly got up, asking for porridge. Upon seeing the patient, the husband remarked that their face was soiled and wondered why there was a fragrance in the room. The patient then seemed unaware of anything else, merely opening their eyes without sleeping. Though their hands and feet could move, they wandered aimlessly. This continued for another two days and nights. The porridge intake increased slightly, but they still wet the bed as before. I became even more optimistic and continued with the previous medication. I then went to another place. The following evening, I was suddenly summoned back urgently to check on the patient, who claimed to be in pain all over. Taking the pulse, I found it was evenly moderate in both sides. They said: &quot;The ginseng and atracarya have all been used up.&quot; I then advised them to add ginseng and atracarya decoction to the previous prescription, remove the Jingjie, and add powdered Xiangfu instead. After one dose, the patient felt greatly relieved.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

The pain seemed to be in the lower abdomen and waist, so I quickly applied a large piece of amber ointment to their lower abdomen and instructed them to rub warm hands between their waist and kidneys, and as they were able to breathe out, the pain eased, and they fell asleep for a short while, repeating this five or six times. One physician advised using a laxative. I replied, &quot;Which is worse, pain or death? If they endure until after midnight, it will resolve on its own.&quot; I then went to another place. By the fourth watch of the night, they came urgently again to report that the pain had intensified. I went to check on them; the pain was excruciating. I instructed them to sit in warm water, which would help relieve it. After changing the water, the pain steadied, and they felt much better. In the second bucket of water, they passed two solid stools and then fell asleep. At dawn, I went to another place again. In the evening, they reported an urgent issue once more.

The physician wanted to use a remedy known as &quot;Ganying Pill,&quot; but I instructed not to give congee or medicinal broth. The patient insisted on having medicine, so I gave them powdered xiangfu to lick. By midnight, the pain gradually reduced, and by dawn, they felt slightly hungry for congee.

Eventually, I mixed half a bowl with broth for them and checked to make them vomit; there was still undigested food, and the pain stopped. I went to other places again, and by midnight, they reported that the pain recurred. Upon inquiry, I advised them to eat congee mixed with vinegar and radish sprouts and also to use the xiangfu powder to induce vomiting, which resolved the pain.

Over the next few years, her condition fluctuated, becoming increasingly severe by the time she reached thirty to forty years of age, with daily episodes sometimes exceeding ten. This led to confusion and forgetfulness, and she wished for death. During a great famine in the years of Xinding, she started gathering wild herbs to eat. Near the water, she found a kind of grass resembling green onions, which she boiled and ate. After eating it, around dawn, she felt uneasy and vomited a thick saliva for several consecutive days, producing around one or two dou. She sweated profusely. Initially, she felt drowsy, but after three days, she felt lighter and healthier, unlike before. Her illness had receded, and her appetite improved; all her pulses were balanced. Not knowing what she had eaten, she inquired of others and found out it was scallion shoots. The scallion shoots referred to here correspond to what the &quot;Bencao&quot; calls lily bulb shoots. The &quot;Tujing&quot; states that lily bulb shoots can treat wind ailments. This was merely a chance discovery of a remedy.</p>

I diagnosed his six pulses as slippery and rapid, with a strong pulse at Renyin. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood, accompanied by phlegm and wind stagnation. I prescribed a formula of Qufeng Quzhen Wan, adding one ounce each of ginseng, angelica, and coptis, along with Anshen Wan to be taken together. In less than six months, he was cured.

According to the \"Bielu\" (Separate Records), there are five types of epilepsy: the first is \"horse epilepsy,\" characterized by neighing and related to the heart; the second is \"sheep epilepsy,\" characterized by bleating and related to the spleen; the third is \"chicken epilepsy,\" characterized by crowing and related to the stomach; the fourth is \"pig epilepsy,\" characterized by grunting and related to the kidneys; and the fifth is \"cow epilepsy,\" characterized by mooing and related to the lungs. These five types of epilepsy correspond to five livestock animals and their respective five organs. In episodes, there occur sudden dizziness, involuntary movements of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyes, twitching of the hands and feet, rigidity of the back, and a return to awareness after a while. The cause is often due to a disturbance in the vital energy of the organs resulting from shock, leading to the generation of phlegm and blockage of the meridians, thus producing these symptoms. The causes may stem from fear experienced in the womb, from exposure to wind, cold, heat, or dampness in infancy, or from inappropriate eating habits which disrupt the vital energy. For those suffering from epilepsy, particularly those under ten years of age, it is generally classified as epilepsy. The origins of the episodes can typically be categorized into three types: wind-related, shock-related, and food-related epilepsy. These three types can manifest as various forms of epilepsy. If not treated promptly, they may develop into chronic conditions. The manifestations occur suddenly with involuntary movements of the mouth and eyes, upward rolling of the eyes, or twitching of the hands and feet, along with stiffness of the back, bending of the neck, or shaking of the head and tongue movements. During a seizure, one should not restrain the person, as holding them can lead to dislocation and hinder their movements."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**On Filial Duties of Confucians** *By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)* **Epilepsy** Epilepsy does not manifest with eyes wide open like a fool; it can be treated with the Three Saint Powder.

However, if the eyes are wide and look foolish, it cannot be treated. The Inner Classic states: “When the spirit cannot be preserved, it means the spirit is chaotic.” Generally, when wind-induced epilepsy occurs, the neck stiffens and one stares blankly, showing a loss of awareness; this indicates heat in the liver meridian. If there is teeth grinding, first use a bitter decoction of celery to expel it; after expulsion, one can take the Xie Qing Pill. Afterwards, use the modified Tong Sheng Powder. In clear cases of teeth grinding, using the Dao Chi Powder will lead to recovery.

When distinguishing between phlegm and heat, if there is heat, use cooling medicines to clear the heart; if there is phlegm, vomiting medicine must be used. After inducing vomiting, take Dongyuan Anshen Pill. The main method should be to vomit, and afterwards use liver-soothing medicines such as Qing Dai, Chai Hu, and Chuan Xiong, with Longhui Pill being particularly suitable. In cases where epilepsy is caused by shock, the spirit fails to reside properly, leading to phlegm accumulation. There are five types of epilepsy: horse, cow, chicken, pig, and sheep. For instance, horse epilepsy shows mouth opening and head shaking with neighing; cow epilepsy presents with eyes staring straight and abdominal distension; chicken epilepsy involves head shaking and a tendency to be startled; sheep epilepsy is characterized by uplifted eyes and tongue protrusion; pig epilepsy often leads to excessive salivation. All these conditions are merely different manifestations of phlegm obstructing the orifices, causing a disorienting state leading to symptoms like dizziness, convulsions of the limbs, facial and body rigidity, excessive shouting, salivation, and recovery shortly after eating. It is advisable to add Xiang San and three whole scorpions."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"**Epilepsy** The \"Inner Canon\" states: In the case of a great yang collapse, the head becomes swollen and heavy, the feet cannot move, and one may suddenly faint in a daze.

The condition of epilepsy is primarily due to phlegm, arising from the movement of fire. The treatment for epilepsy should involve vomiting. If one appears mentally detached with eyes wide open in a foolish manner, I am unsure how to address that. **Pulse Diagnosis** A weak, wiry pulse indicates fright or wind epilepsy, while a deep, rapid pulse reflects phlegm heat. A slippery, large pulse indicates self-recovery, while a deep, small, urgent pulse suggests death; a weak, wiry, urgent pulse also indicates death. A deep, large, slippery pulse at the wrist suggests a solid condition; if deep, it is solid, and if slippery, it is energetic.

When phlegm overflows above the diaphragm, it results in severe dizziness that leads to falling to the ground, without awareness of one's surroundings; this condition is termed epilepsy. Xu Sibao states that adults refer to it as \"epilepsy,\" while children refer to it simply as \"convulsions,\" though it is essentially one disease. However, it differs from conditions like windstroke, cold stroke, heatstroke, and rage fainting. In the case of epilepsy, during an episode, sounds are emitted from the mouth, with the possibility of foaming at the mouth, followed by a period of unconsciousness before experiencing another episode. In contrast, conditions such as windstroke, cold stroke, heatstroke, and rage fainting typically occur silently, without foam during fainting, and do not recur after unconsciousness, though some may have infrequent episodes, they are not like the frequent occurrences in epilepsy. To treat the condition, for those with hidden, strong pulses and experiencing convulsive episodes with signs of fury or heat, perform moxibustion on the third and ninth vertebrae and administer a special herbal remedy known as the \"Magical Fragrance Pill,\" prepared by puncturing a small hole in a gourd, soaking it in cold water for a short time, and taking it as prescribed. For those with thin and weak pulses exhibiting convulsions resembling madness, use the \"Li Henan Five-Ming Pill.\" For chronic cases of wind epilepsy that do not respond to treatment, augment the \"Thick Bark Pill\" with additional ingredients during spring and autumn, and add 1.5 taels of ginseng, calamus, and poria to each dosage, mixing well before consumption."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"Epilepsy, as well as conditions like stroke, chills, heat stroke, dampness, qi blockage, and corpse blockage that lead to dizziness and fainting, all arise from evil qi rebelling upwards and disturbing the head. In the case of epilepsy, it is phlegm evil that rises. Conditions like stroke from cold, heat, dampness, and qi blockage also involve similar evil qi rising. When evil qi rises, the qi in the head becomes chaotic; when the qi in the head is disordered, the vessels become obstructed, and the apertures do not function, leading to a lack of awareness, failure to recognize sounds or people, and ultimately fainting to the ground. Since the disease affects the top of the head, it is called epilepsy. Treatments may involve expelling phlegm to address the disturbance or suppressing it, managing phlegm to prevent qi from rising, using light dispersing techniques for wind, cold, heat, and dampness, or employing acupuncture to guide qi through the vessels in the head, all of which can restore the flow in the vessels at the top of the head and open the apertures, preventing dizziness. Thus, it is understood that the disorder of epilepsy, associated with qi tumult in the head, is indeed a singular condition. Wang Taifu mistakenly divided epilepsy into two diseases, but only Master Sun was able to recognize it as one. Hence, this discussion on the tumultuous qi of the head is specifically placed at the beginning of the chapter on epilepsy to help people understand the disease's nature and its proper treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"**Introduction to Medicine** **(Ming - Li Zhan)** **Different from Madness** Epilepsy resembles madness, but epilepsy occurs intermittently and affects the five organs, whereas madness persists for a long time and primarily attacks the heart. **The Disease is Just Phlegm** The internal injury is most common, while external causes are quite rare. The injury from food and drink accumulates, forming phlegm-fire that obstructs the mind. Fear, anxiety, and anger exacerbate the fire, leading to the spirit losing its home, leaving it empty and filled with phlegm. Danxi states: Epilepsy arises from phlegm obstructing the heart's pathways; it manifests as sudden dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsions in the limbs, facial distortions, rigidity of the chest and back, shouting, and foaming at the mouth, with recovery following shortly after. When the illness begins with body heat and a floating pulse, it is yang epilepsy related to the six fu organs and is easy to treat.

Spleen epilepsy presents with a yellow face, diarrhea, tongue protrusion, and bleating like a sheep. Lung epilepsy is characterized by a white face, foaming at the mouth, abdominal bloating, and sounds like a cow. Kidney epilepsy involves a dark face, staring like a corpse, and emitting sounds like a pig. These five epilepsy symptoms are merely classifications. In reality, they stem from phlegm, fire, and fright. **Phlegm, Fire, and Fright** Obese individuals tend to have more phlegm, which makes noise and froths when they move. For wind phlegm, use a decoction containing three pieces of scorpion mixed with star anise and ginger. Alternatively, there are Fengfeng Quphlegm pills or Wusheng pills. For fright-induced phlegm, use Zishi powder, Jingqi pills, Baolong pills, or Sanxian pills. To calm the spirit, use Shendan or Shouxing pills. If caused by anger, use Shunqi Daotan soup with sweet flag and cinnabar; if due to worry, use Miaoxiang powder. For food phlegm, utilize Xiaoping powder.

Therefore, ancient treatments used Erchen Decoction combined with (herbs) such as Chuan Bei Mu, Nanshen, and Huang Lian to induce vomiting. After vomiting, one must take Zhushay Anshen Wan to reduce southern fire, and Da Ai Long Hui Wan to balance the eastern wood. However, to transform phlegm, one must first regulate the qi; to regulate qi, one must first adjust the middle. If phlegm is stubbornly adhesive, how can it be guided without the aid of pungent and warm remedies? Hence, ancient methods for treating epilepsy all used warming agents. For instance, Qian Zhongyang treated childhood epilepsy; after inducing vomiting and diarrhea, and having consumed too many cooling medicines, the body became cold, eyes closed, and appetite ceased. Later, he used Yihuang San to replenish the center, enabling the child to eat, and then administered Shenqi Wan to replenish northern kidney water so that speech could return.

The causes can be due to unresolved emotional distress, external evils affecting the body, overwhelming fear causing a loss of spirit, or lingering childhood trauma that leaves one vulnerable, all resulting in phlegm obscuring the mind. To treat it, there is no need to differentiate into five types; one should expel phlegm and soothe the qi, clear heat, and pacify the liver, using herbs like Huanglian, (Cao) Lou, Nánxīng, and Bànxià, adjusting the amounts as needed, ensuring effective treatment. For those with heat, cool herbs should cleanse the heart; phlegm must be resolved through purging methods, followed by calming remedies like Dongyuan Anshen Pill, along with liver-pacifying herbs such as Qingdai, Chaihu, and Chuanxiong.

When convulsions occur, the body's fluids are forced upwards, causing the qi to rise and be expelled from the mouth. The movement of qi within the kidneys is the origin of vitality; if the kidneys are weakened, the determination wanes, resulting in a disturbed spirit, rebellious fire, and an attack on phlegm, leading to convulsions. Sometimes, external pathogens invade through the meridians, causing deep internal injuries that damage the origin of life energy. This results in chaos between the pathogenic and healthy forces, obstructing the flow of qi at the Tian Shu point. The defensive qi remains trapped in the yin, unable to circulate. When circulation is hindered, the yin qi accumulates, and when it reaches extreme levels, it manifests, causing the fire of the life gate to rise from below and block the orifices, resulting in only a few utterances resembling a sheep's bleat. The body’s fluids, along with the spleen's saliva, surge up to the chest and are expelled through the mouth. The five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians cannot withstand this upward pressure, thus leading to sudden loss of consciousness. After eating, when the fire dissipates, the person regains awareness. If the life energy has not yet returned, the remaining evil will gradually intensify and reoccur. The so-called origin of life energy refers to that which exists in the beginning of life; it commences with a connection to the navel and is linked to the fetus, following the mother's breathing. If the mother experiences shock, the qi becomes muddled, and over time, this leads to issues. The life gate is simply the true yang point below the navel within the kidneys. If it is again attacked by external pathogens, it will manifest. In this way, if the origin of life is harmed by evil, the individual will appear frail and weak, ensuring a short lifespan."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"**Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment** **(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)** **Diagnosis and Treatment** Epilepsy and convulsive stroke are similar, but in epilepsy, the person falls with sounds from the mouth, produces saliva when awakening, and after waking, may relapse. Some have repeated episodes over several days, while others may have three to five episodes in a single day. In strokes, caused by wind, cold, or heat, the person falls silently, has no saliva upon waking, and does not relapse after waking. Although convulsions also come and go, the body is rigid and may arch like a bow, unlike epilepsy where the body is soft, and it may produce sounds similar to those of pigs, dogs, cattle, or sheep. The \"Original Disease Formulas\" indicate that excessive heat can lead to wind, combined with dryness, causing excessive saliva in the chest and diaphragm, resulting in symptoms like confusion, stiffness, and falling. The \"Three Causes\" suggest that an internal imbalance due to shock can lead to saliva production, blocking the meridians, which results in fainting; this can occur from fright while in the womb, exposure to the six pathogenic factors, or irregular eating, which may go against the internal energy.

If heat is vigorous, even without a startle, it can manifest on its own. Cold herbs should be used to attack and treat it. Yin seizures also originate from phlegm-heat.

In later generations, terms such as \"dianxian,” \"fengxian,\" and \"fengdian\" have emerged, each referring to different conditions, leading to confusion and complexity, which is unnecessary. Similarly, the \"Bielu\" records five types of \"xian\": horse epilepsy, cattle epilepsy, pig epilepsy, sheep epilepsy, and chicken epilepsy, which correspond to modern terms like sheep \"dian\" and pig \"dian.\" These names have been established merely due to phonetic similarity, showing that there is fundamentally only one \"dianxian.\" Different schools have added various conditions to distinguish from \"dian,\" creating unnecessary distinctions. The \"Qianjin Fang\" also mentions \"fengxian,\" \"jingxian,\" \"shixian,\" as well as \"yinxian\" and \"yangxian\"; all these should be clarified and examined further. Epilepsy often results from phlegm and qi. Whenever qi is obstructed or phlegm is stagnant, it can block the meridians and impede the heart’s orifices, leading to sudden episodes of dizziness, rigidity, facial drooping, upward eye movement, spasms of limbs, and a stiff spine, often recovering after a short time. This condition that comes and goes is due to the sudden reversal of qi. Therefore, treatment should focus initially on addressing the excess of phlegm and qi. Additionally, the presence or absence of fire should be assessed, and treatment should be aligned with the pulse and symptoms accordingly."},{"anchor":"trans-17p","marker":"17p","type":"translation","text":"### On Treatment For stagnation of Qi, one should use methods such as Qìzhì Drink, Dà Hézhōng Drink, or Sìmó Drink, or similar remedies like Niúhuáng Wán, Sūhé Wán, and Jíchéng Rùnxià Wán. For excessive phlegm, suitable treatments include Qīnggé Drink, Liù'ān Decoction, Èr Chén Decoction, or Jujube Peel and Pinellia Decoction, or remedies such as Bàolóng Wán and Zhūshā Gǔn Tán Wán. In cases of phlegm combined with fire, Qīnggé Drink, Zhūshā Ān Shén Wán, and Dànxī Rùnxià Wán should be utilized. If phlegm obstructs the Qi severely, it's essential to induce vomiting; after which, treatment should be adjusted according to the symptoms. Epileptic conditions without fire are common. If there is no fire pathogen, it is crucial not to carelessly use cooling herbs, as this could harm the Spleen Qi, leading to the emergence of other conditions. Furthermore, for cases of excessive yin and deficient yang or sudden loss of Qi and blood without phlegm, fire, or Qi reversal symptoms, decoctions like Sì Jūn, Sì Wù, Bāo Zhēn, or Shíquán Dàbǔ, along with warming herbs such as Dried Ginger, Cinnamon, and Prepared Aconite, must be used. One should not dismiss epilepsy as solely resulting from real pathogens and thus entirely prohibit tonic remedies. In cases where true yin is severely compromised, Qi fails to return to the root, leading to intermittent dullness that is difficult to resolve, the use of Zǐ Hécar Wán is essential for efficacy. For those who are generally weak with some manifest phlegm and fire that isn't clearing, and have had a prolonged illness without resolution, Jíyàn Lóngnǎo Ān Shén Wán is most appropriate, and adjustments should be made according to the symptoms."},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"Treatment of Dementia Dementia, often characterized by the absence of phlegm, can arise from repression, lack of fulfillment, excessive thinking, doubts, or fears, gradually leading to confusion.

If treated improperly, there may often be fatalities. I now present a formula, named \"Phlegm-Dispersing and Epilepsy-Clearing Decoction\", comprising three taels each of ginseng, Fu Shen (Poria), and banxia (Pinellia); five taels each of white atractylodes and white peony; one tael each of licorice, aconite, tangerine peel, and sweet flag (acorus); to be decocted and taken. This formula incorporates ginseng, atractylodes, Fu Shen, and peony—spiritual medicines that invigorate the spleen and soothe the liver. The tangerine peel, banxia, and licorice merely aim to eliminate phlegm and harmonize the center. The brilliance lies in the use of aconite and sweet flag to awaken the mysterious mind, guiding each herb directly into the heart's orifices. When the heart is clear, the phlegm naturally disperses, thus alleviating epilepsy. It neither exhausts Qi nor blocks the orifices; how can there be fatalities? Additionally, in cases of sheep epilepsy, where one suddenly collapses, uttering sounds of sheep or horses, and expelling phlegm as if surging, the phlegm confounds the heart orifices, arising from cold and induced by chill. The formula consists of three taels each of ginseng, banxia, and Chinese yam; one liang (six taels) of white atractylodes; five taels each of Fu Shen and job's tears; and one tael each of cinnamon and aconite, to be decocted and taken."},{"anchor":"trans-20p","marker":"20p","type":"translation","text":"This formula helps strengthen the vital energy to nurture the heart and blood, adding cinnamon and prepared aconite to dispel cold evil, and incorporating pinellia to resolve phlegm, naturally allowing the qi to return and stopping the convulsions. One dose can cure completely, never to relapse; it is fortunate to treasure this and not to neglect it! The condition of sheep epilepsy is most common in children, resulting from internal injuries to the spleen and stomach and external invasion of wind and cold, which congeal within the chest. Therefore, whenever wind or cold attacks, the old phlegm reoccurs. Now, using only tonifying and stabilizing herbs, this approach not only alleviates phlegm but also addresses the root of the illness. If one treats with remedies for wind and phlegm, though it may show some efficacy, it ultimately cannot prevent recurrences. For treating bovine and equine epilepsy, although the treatment is similar to that of sheep epilepsy, the symptoms are distinct. The formula uses three taels of ginseng, five taels of white atractylodes, three qian of dried tangerine peel, one tael each of raw southern star, pinellia, and licorice, with one qian of aconite powdered and mixed into pills with honey. This must be taken before the onset of the illness to ensure it will not come back. The reason is that strengthening the stomach qi will naturally prevent phlegm from forming, especially when assisted by phlegm-dispelling agents. If a person afflicted with sheep epilepsy is also treated with this formula, they will recover as well. If a person’s illness resembles the cries of cattle or horses, it is indeed bovine or equine epilepsy.

Suddenly, after the ninth month, she suffered a severe seizure, during which her eyes would roll back, and she would throw her hands and kick her legs vigorously, with all her muscles convulsing. Her throat sounded like a saw, and frothy saliva flowed from both corners of her mouth. This lasted about an hour, and then all symptoms ceased; she appeared to be in deep sleep, completely unaware of her surroundings. After half an hour, she began to feel pain in her lower abdomen, extending up to her heart, and she sweated profusely like rain, with the sweat stopping at her chest. After another half hour, the pain gradually diminished, and the sweating subsided. During the pain, she expressed her discomfort but spoke nonsensically and did not respond to questions, remaining oblivious to her surroundings. When the pain subsided, she returned to deep sleep as before. The seizures and pain alternated without rest for two nights before she finally summoned me to take her pulse. During her pain, the pulse was weak and intermittent, neither firm nor soft, with the left side weaker than the right. I hesitated to give her medication. I waited for her to seize again to observe her condition and pulse. Later, during the onset of another seizure, all six pulses were concealed, except for a strong pulse beneath my fingers. Her eyes were white with a bluish tint, while her face was not discolored, and her hand movements were thrice that of her legs. I asked her that when the pain occurred, she craved heavy pressure, unlike during seizures when she would sweat freely. Her husband confirmed this was indeed the case. I stated: This is not a fatal condition; as long as she can swallow medicine, it can be treated. I tried to administer powdered Xiangfuzi.

Furthermore, bamboo juice diluted with a little ginger juice should be administered in a large quantity; during the administration, the convulsions should be stable, yet the person still sleeps soundly as before. In this state, the patient is unresponsive, having been unconscious for one day and two nights, all efforts abandoned. I observed that the body does not feel hot, and sweating occurs from the pain.

I diagnosed his six pulses as slippery and rapid, with a strong pulse at Renyin. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood, accompanied by phlegm and wind stagnation. I prescribed a formula of Qufeng Quzhen Wan, adding one ounce each of ginseng, angelica, and coptis, along with Anshen Wan to be taken together. In less than six months, he was cured.

His seizures were triggered by work. He was treated with \"Shiquan Dabu\" and \"Jiawei Guipi\" formulas, along with grindings of purple river vehicle mixed in steamed glutinous rice to form pills the size of a sycamore seed. He took a hundred pills each time, three to five times a day, and was cured. Later, he experienced nocturnal emissions and sweating with fever, so he continued using the previous remedies along with \"Liuwwei Wan\" and recovered. This prescription for epilepsy is effective regardless of gender or age. The \"Xue's Medical Cases\" states: The wife of Lord Honglu had a history of epilepsy, which would occur when she was laboring or felt anger, and it would take her a long time to regain her senses. One day, after improper labor following a meal, she had a seizure and was unable to speak for half a day. Some attributed it to wind invading the organs and prescribed agents to dispel wind, resolve phlegm, and regulate qi, as well as Niuhuang Qingxin Wan, but her condition worsened. Her six pulses were floating and strong, but her two inches were deficient, yet she continued to eat and drink. I said: This is harm to the spleen and stomach qi.
