      <div><p><strong>Volume 359 of the Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Medical Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>On External Medical Conditions: Abscesses, Boils, and Toxic Conditions</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Note: The various symptoms of external ailments arising in different parts have previously been detailed in miscellaneous case studies, such as ailments of the head like headaches and issues at the Baihui point; facial ailments like boils and issues at the face point; neck ailments like scrofula and issues at the Tianzhu point; back ailments like conditions affecting the heart and issues at the back point; internal abscesses and boils seen in the chest area; ulcers and sores such as &quot;crane knee&quot; in the limbs; issues like &quot;jealous essence&quot; and hernias in the anterior region. These will not be elaborated further.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen (Plain Questions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theory of Vital Energy Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The change to rich and heavy foods leads to the development of significant boils, akin to receiving from an empty vessel.<br><strong>[Commentary: &quot;High grain&quot; refers to rich flavors. Heavy flavors harm the body; excessive taste damages Qi, and if Qi is harmed, the muscles and surfaces become weak. The heat and toxicity arising from rich food go against the body’s natural patterns, leading to the formation of significant boils. When the surface is weak, heat and toxins take advantage, much like receiving from an empty vessel.]</strong><br>When the nourishing Qi does not circulate and is obstructed in the tissues, it results in abscesses and swellings.<br><strong>[Commentary: When there is a blockage in the body’s tissue Qi, and there is disharmony between Yin and Yang, abscesses and swellings arise. The classic states: When Yang Qi is excessive and nourishing Qi does not circulate, it leads to the formation of boils; when Yin and Yang are not communicating, and the two heats clash, it results in the formation of pus.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The three Yang represent illness, manifesting as cold and heat, leading to boils and swellings.<br>[Note: The three Yang refer to the Taiyang. The energy of Taiyang governs the surface, and when evil energy begins to invade the skin and hair, it battles with the righteous, resulting in illnesses characterized by cold and heat. Taiyang is responsible for opening; when ill, it cannot open and close properly, and the evil energy invades the flesh, giving rise to boils and swellings.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Different Healing Methods</strong></p>
<p>In the eastern region, the people eat fish and have a taste for salt, resulting in boils and sores among them; therefore, they should use stone acupuncture. Thus, the acupuncture stone is also derived from the east.<br>[Note: The nature of fish belongs to fire, and salt overpowers blood. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When diet is irregular, Yin energy becomes insufficient, Yang energy is excessive, and the nourishing energy does not circulate, leading to the outbreak of boils.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;With respect to boils, swellings, muscle spasms, and bone pain, what are the origins of these conditions?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;These are swellings caused by cold air, results of the eight winds&#39; transformations.&quot; The Emperor asked: &quot;How should they be treated?&quot; Qibo said: &quot;These are illnesses of the four seasons; they can be healed by using their dominant traits in treatment.&quot;<br>[Note: Healing through dominance refers to treating based on the overpowering qualities of the five elemental energies and tastes. For instance, if cold is excessive internally, treat with sweet and warming remedies; if winds arise from the east, the wind generates wood, wood generates sour tastes, and spicy flavors overcome sour ones.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Relationship between Reality and Illusion</h3>
<p>The so-called &quot;few needle stones&quot; does not refer to abscesses or sores. Abscesses and sores cannot be dealt with in just a moment. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The issues of abscesses and sores involve both the nourishing and defensive Qi along with the blood and vital energy being stagnant, harming the skin, muscles, bones, and tendons. This concept is different from the superficiality and depth that vary across the four seasons, or the few needle stones found in winter. An &quot;abscess&quot; implies accumulation, while a &quot;sore&quot; indicates blockage. This means that with heat and toxins accumulating externally and blocking internally, one should immediately puncture them, without delaying, to prevent the return of evil toxins.]</strong></p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Points</h3>
<p>When evil Qi overflows and becomes stagnant, heat in the pulse leads to decay in the flesh, causing the nourishing and defensive Qi to be obstructed, which will certainly result in pus; when internal decay affects the marrow and external disruptions harm the large popliteal muscle, it will inevitably lead to decay.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: Qi represents Yang; when evil remains in the skin and muscle layer, the clash between evil and righteous Qi results in symptoms of heat and pus formation. When evil Qi overflows, it obstructs the righteous Qi, leading to an interconnection between the Qi in the valleys and the pulses, causing heat internally and decay externally. If the nourishing and defensive Qi does not circulate, blood and vital energy will stagnate, resulting in pus obstruction. The popliteal region is part of the thigh; &quot;joints&quot; are where tendons and bones are interconnected. If evil remains in between, the tendons and bones must inevitably decay.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>On the Transformation of Qi and the Great Theory of Changes</strong></p>
<p>When the year lacks wood, summer heat flows like fire, causing illnesses such as cold, fever, sores, and rashes.<br>[Note: All are illnesses caused by heat.]<br>When the year lacks water, people suffer from cold sores and flowing ailments.<br>[Note: This indicates a cold poison that does not transform heat, leading to the emergence of cold sores and flow without pus.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Five Constant Regulations and Major Theory</strong></p>
<p>In the season dominated by harmony, illnesses manifest as impediments, swelling, and sores.<br>[Note: All are due to metal being strong and the evils harming the liver.]<br>In the season dominated by restraint, the ailments manifest as eruptions, breaking, and swollen sores.<br>[Note: When earth is insufficient, the transformation of Qi cannot be implemented, counter to the principles of flesh and sinew.]<br>In the season dominated by brightness, the illnesses manifest as laughing, intermittent fevers, sores, and bleeding.<br>[Note: All are illnesses caused by heat.]<br>In the season dominated by firmness, ailments present as violent injuries and sores.<br>[Note: Violent injuries are caused by metal sustaining harm, affecting the skin and leading to ailments.]<br>In the lesser yin, when the heavenly heat descends, it can severely lead to sores.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Note: The summer heat has become excessive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lingshu Classic, Section on Sores and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that the intestines and stomach receive grains, the upper qi flows out to warm and nourish flesh and bones, and to open the pores; the middle qi flows like dew, ascending to the valleys and moistening the collateral vessels. The fluids harmonize and transform, becoming red blood; when blood is harmonious, the collateral vessels become full and then channel into the meridians, all being filled, and then into the main pathways. When yin and yang have unfolded, they move with the breath. Movement follows the meridians, and the cycle follows principles. It aligns with heaven, and must not cease. When examined and adjusted, it takes from the void to supplement the solid; purging leads to insufficiency, illness results in qi reduction, retention causes a sequential pattern. When taking from the solid to supplement the void, replenishment leads to surplus; when blood and qi are harmonized, the form and qi are sustained. I already know the balance and imbalance of blood and qi, but I do not understand the origin of sores and abscesses, the times of their formation and failure, the periods of life and death, how can this be measured? May I inquire?</p>
<p>Qibo replied: The flow of the meridians is unceasing, aligning with the heavens and corresponding with the earth. Thus, when the celestial bodies are misaligned, the sun and moon are eclipsed; when the earth&#39;s order is disrupted, the waters overflow; when grasses do not grow and grains fail to sprout, the pathways are blocked, preventing the movement of people. When communities become scattered, blood and qi are still present. Please speak of the cause! The blood vessels and defenses circulate incessantly, responding above to the stars and below to the cycles. When cold pathogens invade the meridians, blood weeps, and when blood weeps, it becomes obstructed. If obstructed, defensive qi returns, unable to revert, hence the occurrence of sores and swellings.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The cold transforms into heat; when heat prevails, it rots flesh, and when flesh rots, it becomes pus. If the pus does not drain, it rots the tendons; if the tendons rot, they injure the bones. If the bones are injured, the marrow is consumed. When the bones are hollow and do not drain, the blood becomes depleted and void. Thus, the muscles, bones, and flesh cannot nourish one another, the meridians are blocked, and the five organs are affected, leading to death.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What distinguishes sores from carbuncles?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the nourishing and defending energies stagnate within the meridians, the blood stagnates and does not flow. Without flow, the defensive qi becomes impeded and does not circulate, resulting in heat. When the heat is excessive and unrelenting, it leads to flesh rotting; if the flesh rots, it turns into pus, but it cannot penetrate deep enough. The bone marrow does not become scorched, and the five organs are not harmed, hence it is called a carbuncle.&quot; The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What is a sore?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the heat energy is intense and sinks, it depletes the muscles and marrow, linking internally to the five organs where the blood and qi are exhausted. Under the carbuncle, both tendons and good flesh are entirely gone, hence it is called a sore.&quot; A sore has tough skin resembling the hide of an ox, whereas a carbuncle has thin and glistening skin. This is the distinction.</p>
<p>Note: The circulation of human blood and qi interacts with the heavens and earth, resonating with the sun and moon, endlessly revolving through day and night. If any moment of circulation is halted, it stagnates and becomes an abscess, often leading to untreatable death.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p>
<h3>On the True Nature of Pathogenic Factors</h3>
<p>Within the realm of insubstantial evils lies a person who experiences an array of sensations—sudden tremors that affect their form, leading to the fine hairs standing on end and the pores opening. When the evil penetrates deeply, if it strikes the bones, it results in bone pain; if it strikes the muscles, it results in muscle contraction; if it penetrates the vessels, it leads to blood stagnation, which, when obstructed, can result in abscesses. </p>
<p>(Note: The sudden tremors affect the skin, vessels, meat, muscles, and bones, causing pain, contraction, abscesses, and itching. If the Yin predominates, it results in cold; cold drives away the true qi, and if the protective qi is harmed, it leads to numbness. These are all products of pathogenic factors.) </p>
<p>When pathologic factors enter the body deeply, cold and heat clash. If retained for long, they manifest internally. If cold overcomes heat, it results in bone pain and muscle atrophy; if heat overcomes cold, it leads to decaying flesh and putrid muscles, producing pus and harming the bones. If there is discomfort in the muscles, they become unable to stretch; pathogenic factors reside in between and do not react, resulting in muscle spasms. If there is a buildup of qi that cannot be expelled due to retained protective qi, the fluids stagnate too long, forming what is known as intestinal spasms.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Those who suffer for a long time often develop a condition over several years; when pressure is applied, the affected area feels soft and has accumulated energy that returns to it, with bodily fluids retained and pathological energies trapped within. As time passes, it becomes more pronounced and eventually forms a lump. </p>
<p>When the area is pressed and feels hard, it indicates a deeper accumulation involving the bones; energy arises from the bones, and when the energy and bones are in unison, it grows larger and turns into a bone abscess. If the accumulation is in the flesh, vital energy returns to it, with pathology remaining and not dissipating—if there is heat, it transforms into pus; if there is no heat, it becomes a flesh abscess. </p>
<p>All of these types of energy can manifest in various places but bear consistent names. </p>
<p>[Note: The interplay of cold and heat refers to the two energies of yin and yang within the body. The body houses energy; energy returns to the body, representing the harmony between form and energy. Therefore, damage to the body leads to energy disorders, while damage to energy leads to bodily ailments. The accumulated energy pertains to the energy entangled with qualities of cold and heat, returning to the forms wherein pathology resides. Thus, these types of energy can arise from unpredictable locations and are consistently named as decayed flesh, eroded bones, tethered tendons, or former lumps.]</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Pulse Measurement</strong></p>
<p>If the six yang organs are not harmonious, it results in a carbuncle. </p>
<p>[Note: Internally, the six yang organs represent yang energy; externally, the skin embodies yang. The classic text states: If yang energy is excessive and nourishing energy does not circulate, it leads to the emergence of a carbuncle. Hence, when the six yang organs are not in harmony, blood and energy become stagnant in the skin layers, resulting in a carbuncle—this illness originates from within and affects the exterior.] </p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Cold and Heat Diseases</strong><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The five internal organs are associated with five regions of the body: the伏兔 (Fú Tù) representing the kidneys;腓 (Féi) referring to the spleen;背 (Bèi) representing the lungs; the俞 (Yú) points of the five organs; and the项 (Xiàng) representing the liver. If any of these regions develop carbuncles or sores, the person will die. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: When illness arises, it is due to unpredictable emotions, irregular eating and drinking, insufficient yin energy, excess yang energy, and obstruction of nourishing energy, which leads to carbuncles and sores. When yin and yang are not in harmony, the two heats clash, resulting in pus formation. Can a small needle extract it? Qibo said: A sage cannot make something transform because of the evil that cannot be retained. Therefore, when two armies are arrayed against each other with flags raised and blades drawn in the field, this is not a matter decided in a day. The ability to govern the people so they follow commands without the threat of blades is not achieved in a single day, but through continuous teaching. To allow oneself to be afflicted with carbuncles and the accumulation of pus and blood is to stray far from the path. The emergence of carbuncles and the formation of pus and blood do not stem from heaven or arise from the earth, but are born of accumulated subtle influences. Thus, the sage governs when things are still formless, while the foolish encounter the consequences once they have manifested.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;If it has already formed and I do not encounter it, and the pus has already developed but I cannot see it, what should be done?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When pus has formed, the chances are ten to one for death over survival. Therefore, the sage does not allow it to become formed, but instead elucidates good methods, recording them on bamboo and silk, so that capable individuals can follow them and pass them down to future generations, leaving no end of time for them, as it is not encountered when it has already formed.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Skin is a division of meat, with qi and blood emerging from within to the outside. If there is little retention, it gradually accumulates and forms abscesses. Small external ones are easily healed, while larger ones cause more harm. If accumulation is retained internally, forming abscesses and pus that cannot be seen, the chances of survival are ten to one against.) </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;What if there is already pus and blood, and then I encounter it? Should I not treat it with a small needle?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;To treat small issues with small needles is of little effect, but to treat large issues with large needles often causes great harm. Therefore, for those who already have pus and blood, it is only to be taken with a stone and pointed tool.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Treating small abscesses with small needles produces little effect and is easily achieved; treating large abscesses with large needles often results in reverse death harm. Therefore, for those who have already formed pus and blood, it is only with a stone and pointed tool that it should be dealt with.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Jin Kui Yao Lue [Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>For all floating and rapid pulses, there should be feelings of heat followed by chills. If there is a painful area, it should feel like a pus-filled abscess. The master said: To determine whether an abscess is purulent or not, cover the swollen area with your hand; if it feels hot, it has pus, if not, it does not. </p>
<p>A question was asked: If the cun (radial) pulse is floating and weak, should blood be lost? If sweating occurs, what if there is no sweat? The answer is: if there are sores on the body caused by knife or axe wounds, blood loss will ensue. </p>
<p>For injuries caused by metal wounds, the formula &quot;Wang Bu Liu Xing San&quot; is the main treatment.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The causes of abscesses and swellings derive from the accumulation of toxins in the five organs and six bowels; they are not solely due to obstruction of the nourishing and defending (Qi). Their manifestations have specific locations, and their origins have particular returns. For example, when it manifests in the throat or tongue, it is the poison of the heart; when it occurs in the skin or hair, it is the poison of the lungs; when it arises in the muscles, it is the poison of the spleen; and when it appears in the bones or marrow, it is the poison of the kidneys. Manifestations below indicate yin poison; those above indicate yang poison. Externally manifested cases relate to the six bowels; internally manifested cases relate to the five organs. Thus, internal issues are termed “decay,” while external issues are called “suppuration.” Manifestations above are rapid in onset, while those below are slower. Conditions affecting the six bowels are easier to treat, while those affecting the five organs are more difficult to heal. Additionally, conditions near the bones tend to be cold, while those near the weak areas are often hot. If conditions near the bones persist for a long time without healing, they may transform into blood pests; if near the weak areas, they may lead to gas transmission causing leakage. When blood pests form, there is often more itching and less pain, or itching may precede pain. When leakage occurs, there is often more pain and less itching, or there may be no pain and no itching. For cases with internal deficiency and external excess, there is typically more pain and less itching, and if bleeding does not cease, there is a high likelihood of death; suppurative conditions tend to flourish. Excessive vomiting or regurgitation, and irregular eating and drinking, are all results of abscesses and swellings. The causes are numerous; in the end, one must rely on thorough investigation.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Types of Sores</strong></p>
<p>The five sores are all caused by emotions such as joy, anger, worry, and thought, exposure to cold and heat, excessive drinking of strong liquor, an indulgence in rich and sweet foods, toxic fish, vinegar, and sauces, and excessive sexual desire. These toxins accumulate and seep into the internal organs, and if left untreated for a long time, they begin to manifest. Their names are five: first is the white sore, second is the red sore, third is the yellow sore, fourth is the black sore, and fifth is the blue sore. </p>
<p>The white sore appears under the right nostril; it starts as a millet-sized bump, with a red root and white head. It causes numbness or itching, making one hate the cold and feel heaviness in the head, resembling the symptoms of a cold. The person loses appetite, feels fullness and discomfort in the chest, and may experience difficulty in breathing. Those affected who are in severe condition may die, but if not severe, it can be treated. This ailment lasts no more than five days; calamity is sure to follow. Therefore, it should be treated promptly.</p>
<p>The red sore appears beneath the tongue, with both the root and head being red. It causes pain, and the tongue becomes hard, making it difficult to speak. There may be feelings of shock, irritability, confusion, and excessive thirst leading to continuous drinking of water. If urination is obstructed, those in a frantic state may die, while those less affected can be treated. This condition does not last beyond seven days; calamity is certain to follow.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Both adults and children can suffer from it. Yellow sore appears at the edge of the lips and gums, its color yellow, containing yellowish fluid; it causes excessive eating and subsequent vomiting, numbness in the hands and feet, continuous salivation, abdominal distension with discomfort, and unawakened sleep, leading to death if severe, though it can be treated if caught early. Black sore arises in front of the ears, appearing like a scar, its color black and irregular in shape, causing severe jaw tightening and numbness in the lower back and knees. Otherwise, the illness may result in death within three years due to gradual depletion of kidney energy; thus, one should be cautious of desires. Blue sore develops beneath the eyes, initially resembling a tumor, its body hard and blue like stone, causing blurred vision and excessive fear, leading to restless sleep; if it doesn&#39;t heal over time, it may cause blindness or loss of the eyes. If one has this, calamity is certain within a year. The white sore is rooted in the lungs, the red sore in the heart, the yellow sore in the spleen, the black sore in the kidneys, and the blue sore in the liver. The signs of these five sores are significant diseases that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Formula</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Pulse Diagnosis and Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is rapid but the body has no heat, there is likely an internal abscess.<br>If the pulse is floating and rapid but the body feels cold instead of hot, and there is an area of pain, it should be considered as forming an abscess.<br>A weak and slow pulse will definitely indicate heat, while a weak and rapid pulse denotes a chill, suggesting the formation of an abscess.<br>When the pulse is floating and rapid but the body is not hot and appears silent, with slight dryness in the stomach and no identifiable pain, it is likely that an abscess will form.<br>A slippery and rapid pulse indicates fullness, while rapidness indicates heat; a slippery pulse relates to the nutritive level, and rapidness pertains to the defensive level. When the nutritive and defensive energies are in conflict, it will lead to the formation of an abscess. Where heat consumes, it results in abscess and pus.<br>If the body has pain in specific areas, there will frequently be sores.<br>When the &quot;Fuyang&quot; pulse is slippery and rapid, the treatment should focus on the lower body. If the &quot;Shaoyin&quot; pulse is slippery and rapid, it may indicate sores in women&#39;s private areas.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>When carbuncles and boils first appear, they seem minor, and people often do not pay them any heed. However, this is truly a serious concern, and prompt treatment is essential. If delayed, the condition may worsen, leading to calamities which are numerous. A boil appearing on thin skin is termed a &quot;boil,&quot; while one on thick skin is termed a &quot;carbuncle,&quot; both requiring urgent treatment.</p>
<p>At the onset of a boil or carbuncle, it may resemble a small pimple, may be very painful, may cause mild discomfort, or may manifest as a small, rice-sized white pus; all these are early signs that need careful observation. If any small change is noticed, it is crucial to respond with urgency and actively treat it, as well as use painful methods to rid the body of heat toxins quickly. If no medications are available, one should apply cauterization of at least a hundred times directly to the area; for larger conditions, cauterize from multiple sides over two or three hundred times. Applying numerous cauterizations may be beneficial. Additionally, use cool medicinal remedies of various kinds, as they will certainly aid in a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>In terms of medicinal application, the treatment should be directly at the site of the boil, with the medicine creating an opening to allow heat to escape. Fire needles may also be applied directly to the area, and this will facilitate healing.</p>
<p>For abscesses, tumors, and other similar conditions, avoid needing to use needles, as this may lead to significant problems.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>For all abscesses, regardless of size, once they are felt, take a piece of glue the size of the palm, soak it in warm water to soften it, and attach it to the lump, adjusting its size to match. Make a small hole at the center, similar to the size of a coin, press it onto the swelling so it fits well. Wait a moment until it dries quickly; if there is no pus yet, it will not develop further. If pus is already formed, it will come out on its own. If you use a sharp needle to puncture the hole to release pus, it is very good. Once healed, remove the glue.</p>
<p>For swellings that are larger than an inch, they are called abscesses; those smaller than an inch are called small abscesses. If they are the size of a bean, they are called vesicles; all these are at their initial stage. Take five-fragrance and forsynthia decoction and ingest it over several doses, stopping once healed.</p>
<p>For large and shiny abscesses, if they are not very hot, and the flesh is even and purple without any sharpness, there is no need to attack it; simply give a decoction of bamboo leaves and astragalus to strengthen its energy, as even flesh indicates no pus. If an abscess suddenly hurts, apply an eight-flavor astragalus powder. Large abscesses take seven days, while small ones take five days.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If there are strong individuals, it is better to allow broken sores to release fluid. If the heat makes it impossible to approach, first take Wang Buliuxing powder internally, and apply the external ointment on the back of the head. If the back has a breakout without pain, the milk should be made very hot. Wait for the hand to press it; if it rises immediately with pressure, the sore is ripe and needs to be needled. The needling method must ensure that pus is drawn out, guided by intention. For the chest and back, do not apply more than an inch; if there is no pus, then give meat-grease powder, applying a sharp tip inside the sore. If the body&#39;s energy is hot and stagnant, then take Mujianzi powder. After five days, if the sore desires to scab over, take the pus-dispelling internal remedy. </p>
<p>After a sore breaks, the body tends to feel extremely weak and cold internally, with heat externally. [Text missing] There can be swellings that resemble sores but are not; if pressing on the swelling does not show any connections, it is likely wind poison. Do not needle this; it is advisable to take Shengma decoction and apply ointment externally. For the opening of the sore, leave three-tenths at the top and needle one-tenth at the lower part.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>When the condition is very familiar, being familiar will relieve the pain. If it is broken and not healing well, use pig trotters soup to wash it, twice a day in summer and for six or seven days in winter. Half a dose of the soup can also be used. For abscesses with necrotic flesh after the breakdown, it is advisable to wash with pig trotters soup to remove impurities, then apply the flesh-eating ointment. Once the necrotic flesh has been completely removed, apply fresh meat ointment and rub the edges to encourage healthy flesh to grow quickly. One must refrain from sexual activities, avoid wind and cold, and not exhaust oneself. Wait for the sinews to recover before resuming normal activities. New flesh is easily injured; if it gets hurt, it can lead to internal pus, which can cause severe recurrence that is difficult to treat, so be very careful. White scabs are particularly to be avoided. </p>
<p>Regarding all sudden swellings, each is different. Regardless of proximity or remoteness, one should take five-spice and forsythia decoction, drain the blood, and apply a small bean powder. Periodically, prick with a needle to remove blood.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>If the wound has already rotted away, one should still take Five-Spice Decoction and Rehmannia Decoction to help it along, adjusting the dosage according to the severity of heat. Externally, wash and compress with Ascending Hemp Decoction, and apply Ascending Hemp Ointment. If there are flesh tumors, use white (Paeonia) powder to apply over them; any blue or black flesh should cease. If healthy flesh appears, apply Ascending Hemp Ointment. If the flesh does not grow, use a mixture of Huangqi powder. If applying white (Paeonia) powder does not fully remove blue or black unhealthy flesh, one may use half a qian of lacquer (Paeonia) powder mixed with three qian of white (Paeonia) powder, applying it gradually. Each powder should be individually processed and sifted to obtain a fine powder for use. If there is a sudden pain in the body, resembling the sensation of being struck, it is called &quot;qi pain.&quot; The pain is unbearable, wanders, and comes and goes at intervals. When in pain, there is slight heat; when the pain subsides, there is coldness. This is all due to receiving warm qi in winter and then being exposed to cold in spring, leading to wind which causes it to manifest not as warm illness but rather as qi pain.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>First, take the Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction and apply Dan Shen Paste; also, brew willow bark with white wine and apply warmth. If there are small red spots, you should puncture them to let out blood. The Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction and the Small Bamboo Dripping Decoction can be taken several doses. Do not stop the medication if one dose hasn’t cured you, as assuming it is ineffective will bring disaster. In between, using White Wei Powder is good. </p>
<p>If there is painful swelling resembling an abscess without a head, with a soft swelling that does not change color, but the skin is tight and painful, and cannot be touched, you should also take this Five-Spice Decoction. Then use white needles to bleed it, followed by applying Spiny Farewell Powder.</p>
<p>For chest pain and shortness of breath, you should enter a dark room, press your index finger to your left eye, and if you see light, it indicates an abscess in the chest; if you do not see light, it is the internal illness manifesting outward.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The classics state: Qi resides within the meridians; when both Qi and blood are stagnant, they congeal and form abscesses. It does not mention the heat that causes this, later leading to boils. Furthermore, when Yang Qi gathers, cold transforms into heat, and if the heat becomes excessive, it causes the flesh to rot into pus. Additionally, when the body has heat and is struck by cold, the pulse constricts and does not circulate, leading to the obstruction of heat and the formation of abscesses. There are methods of moxibustion and warming treatments. When heat has not yet fully developed, it is advisable to use cold medicines for application. Once heat has formed, treatments should aim to dispel the heat and prevent the formation of pus. For red, swollen areas with pointed heads, apply a mixture of sealwort and plaster. Another method is to mix vinegar with clam shell ash for application; replace it once it dries. Throughout my life, I have recorded all effective treatments for abscesses that I have encountered. Upon investigation of the sources of these ailments, many arise from medicinal substances, or some may stem from ancestors who consumed stones, leading their descendants to suffer from such diseases. It is particularly advised to avoid eating flour, wine, and garlic, and to be cautious with thick bedding in warm environments. Those who can exercise caution may avoid illness throughout their lives. I have personally verified all of this, thus I specifically discuss it here.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Boils and Sores</strong></p>
<p>The nature of the body must be nourished and maintained. If rest and activity are not balanced, numerous ailments will arise. Therefore, in the changing of the four seasons, yin and yang alternate. These two energies clash with each other, and during this time, there are bound to be sudden violent winds, thick fogs, extreme cold, and intense heat. If one does not avoid these at the proper times and encounters them unexpectedly, they can penetrate the body, abruptly affecting the skin, flowing through the meridians, and causing blockages in the natural openings, leading to stagnation of vital energy. This impedes the proper circulation of yin and yang, transforming into boils, sores, and toxic masses. As for boils, if not recognized early, they can lead to death before treatment can be sought. If one waits until they are fully developed to seek remedies, it may be too late. Hence, those who tend to their health must recognize these signs early. All wounds and sores cannot escape this principle. </p>
<p>For treating boils, one must pierce directly at the center of the pain, along with several punctures around the edges, to draw out blood. By allowing blood to flow and applying medicine, the medicinal properties can then enter through the needle holes, which is beneficial. If the treatment does not reach the interior of the sore, it will not be effective.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Moreover, its swelling appears at the corner of the mouth, on the cheek and tongue, looking red and black like beads. The pain is acute and corresponds to the heart. This is caused by the cold poison of autumn and winter, which, when long trapped beneath the skin, transforms into this disease. If not treated promptly, day and night it grows roots, flowing into the various meridians like arrows striking the body, causing immobility. If one is careless about oral tastes and sexual conduct, death is inevitable. After five or six days without healing, if one sees fire in the eyes, is confused in spirit, has a dry mouth and is troubled at heart, death follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first type is called &quot;Mazi Ding,&quot; which appears as a raised head on the meat, about the size of millet, with a slightly dark color, slightly red around the edges, and causes much itching. One should avoid eating sesame seeds and walking in fields of sesame.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second type is &quot;Shidings,&quot; which connects flesh and skin, with a color as dark as black beans, very hard, resistant to being pricked. There is a dull pain deep within. One should avoid rubble and bricks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third type is &quot;Xiong Ding,&quot; appearing with a black, thick head, surrounded by blisters that ooze yellow fluid, large like a coin hole, and raised. One should avoid sexual conduct.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fourth type is &quot;Ci Ding,&quot; with a slightly yellow sore head, dark inward, resembling a burn, with blisters around it, a sunken heart, red in color, and large like a coin hole. One should avoid sexual conduct.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>The fifth type is the fire boil, which appears as if burned by boiling water. The sore has a black and dark head, with blisters forming around the edges, resembling red millet. Avoid exposure to fire and heat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The sixth type is the rotten boil, which has a slightly black color with white spots. When the sore is ruptured, pus and water flow out, and its shape is similar to a spoon&#39;s surface. Avoid eating hot, rotten, or foul-smelling items.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The seventh type is known as thirty-six boils, characterized by a black raised head that looks like a black bean, with large red around the edges. One may arise today, two tomorrow, three the day after, increasing to ten in three days. If it reaches thirty-six, it cannot be treated with medicine; however, if it has not reached thirty-six, it can be treated. Commonly referred to as black blisters. Avoid feelings of anger and accumulated resentments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The eighth type is the snake-eye boil, which has a black head and raised skin resembling a small bean, appearing like a snake&#39;s eye in size and is hard in texture. Avoid being seen by someone with an evil eye and jealousy, as well as exposure to poison.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ninth type is the salt-skin boil, which is large like a spoon&#39;s surface, with red all around and black millet-like grains appearing. Avoid salty foods.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The tenth type is the water-wash boil, shaped like a coin or the size of a coin hole, with a white head, black and dark inside, and hard juice flowing from the center.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Avoid drinking water and washing when crossing rivers.</p>

<p>On the eleventh, there is the &quot;knife-dislike sore,&quot; which has lesions that are wide and narrow like the size of garlic leaves, one inch long, with the flesh on the left side blackened as if burned. It is crucial to avoid stabbing or cutting with knives or sickles. Wounds caused by iron blades can be treated with medicine.  </p>
<p>On the twelfth, there is the &quot;floating froth sore,&quot; which has a curved and rounded appearance, slightly uneven, long and narrow like garlic leaves, yellow inside and black outside. The black area is painless when pricked, while the yellow area causes pain when pricked.  </p>
<p>On the thirteenth, there exists the &quot;cow-captured sore,&quot; characterized by raised blisters that cannot be squeezed open.  </p>
<p>Among these thirteen types of sores, they initially cause itching followed by pain, cold sensation followed by heat, and when heat settles, cold emerges. There is often a heaviness in the limbs, headaches, and feelings of shock with blurred vision. In severe cases, it can lead to vomiting, which is hard to treat. The &quot;hemp seed sore&quot; type only causes itching from beginning to end; the greatest taboo is that it should not be touched, as touching it makes treatment very difficult. The &quot;floating froth sore&quot; and the &quot;dog sore&quot; types have no taboos; even if left untreated, they do not lead to mortality. They share similar cold and hot characteristics with other sores and can be treated with the same method, with a high likelihood of success. To know the condition of a touched sore, it is extremely painful, particularly around the spine, making it unbearable.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Complete Book of Wounds and Ulcers</strong><br><strong>By Dou Hanqing of the Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method for Applying Surrounding Medicine</strong></p>
<p>For applying surrounding medicine, one must make great effort to stir it thoroughly over a thousand times. Since the medicine is thick, apply it lightly, ensuring that the opening is shaped like a goose egg. Thin paper must be used to cover it, making sure to tear it into pieces to avoid tearing and causing pain. Once the surrounding medicine is slightly dry, use the remaining juice of the mixed medicine to moisten it, to enhance the medicinal effect. Moreover, if the medicine is dry, it cannot penetrate the muscles; thus, moisture is needed to open the channels.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Technique</strong></p>
<p>When a wound or ulcer arises, the pain is fundamentally due to heart fire. Over time, yang energy rises, causing the flesh to fester into pus. If one opens the wound without determining whether there is pus or not, fresh blood will pour out—where would the pus come from? This will cause the patient to suffer from cold and fever, experiencing pain day and night without relief. First, press the affected area with a finger; if it softens, observe where the pus is collecting. Choose a favorable day and orient the knife upwards when making the incision to avoid damaging new flesh. Once the knife is withdrawn, take a piece of cotton paper with oil to help gather the pus; after half a day, it will be easier to extract. Apply pus-drawing ointment on the outside, and use a gathering powder around it for dressing.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion on Carbuncles</h3>
<p>Generally, there are thirteen types of carbuncles, which are categorized as blue, yellow, red, white, and black, corresponding to the five organs. There are also heat carbuncles, fire carbuncles, qi carbuncles, and cold carbuncles, each differing in urgency and manifestation based on their timing. At the initial onset, one may experience swelling before pain, or cold before heat, along with rigidity and heaviness in the limbs. Severe pain can lead to chills, fever, numbness at the edges of the sore, and eventually intense pain on one side of the body, with accompanying symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, coldness in the feet up to the knees, and purple-black discoloration surrounding the area, all indicating a serious condition. </p>
<p>Only the carbuncle of the itchy type has itching at both the beginning and end; its symptoms of cold and heat are similar to other carbuncles, but if the pain is particularly severe in the back, it may be due to external injury, in which case taking juice from goji root is very effective. For those with sudden throat pain, heart discomfort from cold and heat, or abdominal pain with chills and fever, precautions should be taken against developing carbuncle symptoms. </p>
<p>Typically, carbuncles appear near the mouth, inside the cheeks, or on the tongue, presenting as red and black dots that are painful, particularly affecting the heart. If not treated immediately, they can worsen day by day, spreading to various channels and causing severe harm, similar to an arrow piercing the body. After five or six days, if the condition worsens, toxic energy may enter the abdomen, leading to symptoms such as seeing fire in the eyes, confusion, irritability, vomiting, and a state resembling drunkenness or delirium, indicating that treatment is impossible.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>A sore with a head that is black, hard, and concave; a sore with a white, swollen, solid head; a sore with a head that is bean-colored; a sore with a bright red head; a sore with black veins inside the head; a sore with a red, raised, and soft head; a sore with a head that is yellow like a gardenia; a sore with a head like gold foil; a sore with a head like a cornelian; a sore with a head like a pomegranate seed—if it initially resembles wind rash or acne, and when scratched it produces yellow fluid inside, showing red and black veins with slight swelling, and the flesh protrudes like a fish eye, accompanied by excruciating pain that penetrates to the bone. When they persist, they develop into rotten sores, with deep holes underneath like a large needle having pierced through. At first, it protrudes like a nail, hence the name &quot;disease sore,&quot; causing chills, fever, and stiffness in the limbs with pulling pain. Within a day or two, the sore turns black, charred, and swollen, and the root is hard and raised, making it painful to approach. If disturbed, it causes severe pain, and in serious cases, it manifests in the head, face, hands, feet, and joints—this is where qi and blood gather, requiring urgent treatment. There are those resembling burn sores with blisters around the edges, but when they mature, pus and fluid ooze from the sore, similar to a honeycomb disease, which heals more easily.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>This ulcerous condition is severe: yellow eyes, blue face, black tongue, cold sweat, thirst, feet cold to the knees, lack of appetite yet still passing waste, ulcers that are cold and painless, vomiting, no emergence of the ulcer, the surrounding areas are not red, the edge of the ulcer is numb, dry and black with spines, the edge is purplish-black, unbearable pain responding to the heart, seeing fire in the eyes, confusion of spirit, irritability, and a dazed mind, resembling someone who is drunk or foolish—all are difficult to treat. Try pricking the middle finger and toe of the affected person; if there is no pain, it is hard to cure. Generally, when newly born, soft, red, and warm, if it suddenly sinks and turns black, it is called &quot;running yellow,&quot; which indicates a critical condition; urgently take Feilong Duoming Dan or Zhuixing Duoming Tang. If it appears near the outer corner of the eye, it is called &quot;nail brain abscess,&quot; with a ten-percent survival rate. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that white abscesses appear on the right nostril, red ones at the root of the tongue, yellow ones on the lips, black ones in front of the ear, and green ones beneath the eyes. This categorizes the five colors according to the five organs, each corresponding to specific locations. However, it can erupt on the shoulder, waist, or foot; it is particularly urgent if it appears between the head, face, hands, or joints.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Method for Removing Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Abscesses often appear on the upper lip, starting small like a grain of rice or resembling a pimply spot. If squeezed, they can turn into a sore due to exposure to hot steam or cold wind. The sore is another name for the abscess. First, mash five pieces of scallion white with &quot;Feilong Duoming Dan&quot; and take them with half a bowl of hot wine, then cover the affected area with a cloth to induce slight sweating, which is ideal. Take the medicine in the morning, and in the afternoon, use a sharp magnet to make a cross incision on the sore. Then mix and insert &quot;Feilong Duoming&quot; powder inside, while using crushed toad tongue and toad skin on the outside, and take a decoction for chasing the abscess internally. If it occurs on the hair, shave off the hair and treat it as above. This method is highly effective, helping many people. For any occurrence on the head or face, do not apply cold medicine. If you apply cold medicine, it will drive the hot and toxic energy into the throat, preventing recovery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Various Types of Boils</p>
<p>Sesame boil: Apply black cloud ointment, or purple flower herb on the sore. If it spreads throughout the body causing pain and inability to move, take detoxifying herbal drinks and toad venom pills.</p>
<p>Qi boil: Take toad venom pills with supreme gold ingot, and apply purple flower herb externally.</p>
<p>Fire boil: Take toad venom pills with supreme gold ingot, applying purple flower herb on the sore.</p>
<p>Cold boil: This arises from millets, wind and damp remaining toxins, prolonged exposure to cold weather leading to attack at the knee, transmitting to the foot Taiyin meridian. It initially appears like a grain of rice, gradually turning into an ulcer, dark as coal, with corrupted blood invading, damaging bones and flesh, resulting in serious ailments. Year after year, joint pain persists, and muscle cannot regenerate. First, use a decoction of mugwort, snake bed seed, purple perilla, and pigweed to wash it; internally take astragalus, white peony, wormwood, angelica, and raw prepared earth herbs, while externally using a medicated paper plaster. Should the joints suffer, internal reflection may lead to recovery.</p>
<p>Fish navel boil: In spring, use black cloud ointment; in summer, use toad tongue ointment; in autumn, use tung oil ointment; in winter, use supreme gold ingot.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Flying Toxin</strong></p>
<p>This toxin arises because of the heat from the skin caused by an imbalance in the body&#39;s defense systems, resulting in this sore. There is red swelling that spreads unpredictably. Wash the affected area with warm water and prick the toxin with a triangular needle, using two to thirty pricks, or apply magnetic therapy, which is also effective. Then use a toxin-drawing paste to apply.</p>
<p><strong>Red Silk Sore</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;red silk&quot; refers to accumulated toxins in the heart and intestines, causing stagnation of qi and blood, which manifests on the skin. The red lines run through like a red thread, causing either pain or itching, produced by an excess of wind and heat. It acts with the speed of an arrow; if it reaches the heart, it can be fatal. Immediately, use magnetic therapy to pierce it and expel the toxic blood; then prick again within the red lines to eliminate its root. Urgently use decoctions like angelica and forsythia as an antidote. Abstain from alcohol for several days.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion on the Six Writings of Hejian</h3>
<p>Sores and abscesses belong to the category of fire; they must be treated by distinguishing between internal and external sources. As stated in the Inner Canon: &quot;Changes in rich and fatty foods give rise to large boils. Their origin is internal, manifesting externally.&quot; When one is in a state of vacuity, internal blockages express themselves outwardly, yet one may not know the path of their emergence; they all arise from a state of vacuity. </p>
<p>For instance, when the Taiyang channel is vacuous, the symptoms appear on the back; when the Shaoyang channel is vacuous, they manifest at the temples; if the Yangming channel is vacuous, the signs show at the beard; and when the Du Meridian is vacuous, they arise from the head. The classic states: &quot;The dampness of the earth can harm the skin and tendons when they are affected.&quot; If it manifests externally, a strong presence can lead to internal circulation issues. </p>
<p>If the pulse is deep and solid, one must first rectify the internal state to eradicate its origin. If the pulse is floating and large, one must first clear the interior, or else internal qi may be damaged. When there is a balance between internal and external, and the pathogenic qi is exceptionally strong, it obstructs the meridians, causing boils and swellings. The classic says: &quot;When the nourishing qi does not follow, it rebels against the flesh, thus causing boils and sores.&quot; This occurs due to a failure to clear the interior and to ensure smooth circulation, along with a breakdown in the mechanism of nourishment and defense.</p>
<p>The key to treating sores lies in clearly understanding the three methods: clearing the interior, smoothing out communication, and activating the nourishing and protective functions. Clearing the interior addresses issues from the outside in; smoothing out communication deals with matters from the inside out; and activating nourishment and protection focuses on the internal state itself.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>In the case of conditions that are internal and external, the pulse is deep and strong, with symptoms of heat and agitation, and there is no external visible inflammation or pain; this indicates that the pathogenic factors are deeply rooted within, thus it is essential to first clear the channels to eliminate the root cause. For conditions that are external but affect the internal, the pulse is superficial and rapid, with inflammation and swelling externally, and the symptoms are clearly manifested on the surface; this raises concerns that the pathogenic factors may be severe and could penetrate inward, thus it is necessary to first relieve the surface. For conditions that are between internal and external, there is neither obvious inflammation nor adverse energy externally, and the internal organs are functioning properly; it is understood that the issue lies within the meridians and that a balance between nourishing and protective energies is needed. After applying these three methods, even if the condition has not changed significantly, it will likely not deteriorate, and the pathogenic factors can be substantially reduced, leading to easier recovery. Therefore, the classic texts state: all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers belong to the heart fire. It also says: to understand the essentials can be summed up in one sentence; to not understand the essentials leads to endless dispersion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; says: pains, itching, sores, ulcers, boils, swelling, rashes, neoplasms, and severe accumulations are all due to heat. When the five organs are not in harmony and the nine orifices are blocked; if the six bowels are unbalanced, this can lead to accumulations resulting in boils. When close to fire energy, slight heat causes itching, severe heat causes pain, and nearby heat can burn and cause sores; all are manifestations of fire. Boils and swellings in a person arise from internal heat and external deficiency. When wind and dampness invade, they lead to sores and swellings. The lungs govern qi and are reflected in the skin, while the spleen governs muscles; when qi is deficient, the skin pores open, allowing wind and dampness to invade. If the spleen&#39;s qi is damp and there is internal heat, sores will develop. Swellings occur due to the accumulation of cold, heat, and toxic energies in the meridians, causing blood to stagnate, resulting in obstructions and swelling.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>When wind pathogenic factors do not arise, there are no roots or heads. When cold and blood clash, there are roots and heads. If there is obstruction and excess, it leads to pus; if there is red swelling, it causes wind and qi to break through. Pain and itchiness from sores indicate pain as real and itchiness as false. The false is not caused by cold, but rather indicates an extreme of heat. Itchiness suggests a mild illness. Therefore, when fire is strong in summer, all things flourish and thrive. If one puts it to the fire or soaks it in broth, and the itchiness worsens, it is due to mild heat. The removal of itchiness implies that heat allows the skin to relax, the pores to open, and yang qi to be released, scattering away the heat. Sometimes, when summer heat causes skin itchiness, pouring cold water on it does not alleviate the itch, suggesting that cold can constrict, keeping the pores tightly closed, leading to stagnation of yang qi, and internal heat arises from this stagnation. All sores and ulcers are due to heat, and when they become infected and produce pus, it is similar to grains and meats that rot when heat reaches its peak, causing decay and discharge of foul moisture. The rotting and decay occur due to the transformation of water. Superficial and large swellings are boils, while deep and severe sores are carbuncles; when heat exceeds blood, it becomes a boil with pus. A sore with a head is a small ulcer. Rashes that are elevated and small are hives. Tumors that are red and inflamed indicate excessive heat. When a person is close to fire, mild heat causes itch, extreme heat causes pain, and being too near leads to burns and sores, all are manifestations of fire’s influence.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If one experiences an itch or pain like a light prick of a needle, it is akin to sparks of fire igniting the skin. Itching is a manifestation of a graceful ailment. When treated with fire or soaked in broth, if the itching intensifies, it is due to a slight warmth. Consequently, when the itch subsides, the heat relaxes the skin, opens the pores, allows the yang energy to disperse, and the heat dissipates as well. In summer, if the skin itches and does not alleviate with cold water, it is because the cold can constrict, closing the pores tightly, leading to the accumulation of yang energy which cannot escape, resulting in internal combustion of heat.</p>
<p>If scratching alleviates the itch, scratching represents the action of fire; mildly it can still cause an itch, but when severe, it removes the itch. Scratching makes the skin feel spicy and corresponds to metal transformation, and since spiciness can disperse, when metal transformation appears, the fiery power is divided and resolves.</p>
<p>Some say that pain is real while itch is illusory; this does not imply that illusion is cold but rather indicates varying degrees of heat. If one questions why sores and ulcers are linked to fire and yet can fester and discharge pus, the reason is akin to grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables: when they reach excessive heat, they rot and dissolve into impure water. The process of decay is a result of water transformation.</p>
<p>This aligns with the principle of the five elements: when one aspect exceeds its limits, it paradoxically returns to control itself. Thus, if fire heat becomes excessive, it returns to transformation by water. Similarly, salt can preserve substances and prevent decay because its nature is cold water transformation, controlling fire heat to prevent it from exceeding limits, thus maintaining longevity. This principle applies to all things.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The changes brought on by rich foods are also due to an excess of flavors, where the nourishing essence does not flow as it should, working against the body’s natural processes and resulting in boils and swellings. The nourishing essence refers to the stomach&#39;s energy. When food enters the stomach, it is first processed by the spleen and then directed towards the lungs. The lungs then disperse this energy through the hundred vessels, which subsequently affects the skin and hair, and sends the essence down to the five organs and six bowels, forming a delicate balance. </p>
<p>Nowadays, those who are wealthy and noble do not understand moderation. They indulge in wine and rich lamb, mixing in heavy flavors, and over time this leads to an excess of thick, rich substances, which are the most yang in nature. These cannot navigate the body&#39;s cavities effectively and instead cause a reversal towards the yin pathways, resulting in a significant buildup of dampness. This creates a condition where the son (yang) opposes the mother (yin), leading to excessive fire. When this real heat becomes pronounced, it inevitably impacts the kidneys. If one is not careful in intimate relations and damages their true fire, then moisture will rise, transforming into damp heat, causing sores to appear on the back and head. This is one of the most severe forms of major boils.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If toxic gas escapes from the lungs or from parts of the spleen and stomach, it is the next level of toxicity. If it emerges from other channels, it is the next level thereafter. The places where damp heat toxins reside are inevitably subject to decay and corruption. Thus, the classic says that the transformation of rich foods leads to significant sores; those who are in a state of deficiency, like holding an empty vessel to receive substances, cannot help but absorb all. </p>
<p>The method for treating major sores must involve draining the nourishing energy. In terms of root and branch, the initial affliction is the root; without the use of bitter cold medicines as the main remedy, one cannot alleviate the suffering and pain. Many sores and ulcers are painful, often treated with frankincense and myrrh, combined with aromatic medicines to mitigate them; however, there is no rationale for significant reduction in pain, which is a misunderstanding. </p>
<p>If the meridians are unblocked and the viscera are free from stagnation, pain will surely cease. Pain should be alleviated with bitter cold medicines, and none fail to heal. Eating raw flesh is akin to self-destruction, as the principle should be to drain energy and then supplement accordingly.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Method of Adjusting Medications</strong></p>
<p>For abscesses with pus and headache accompanied by weakness, add Schisandra to the core remedy. If feeling disoriented and restless, add Ginseng and Poria. If weak with fever, add Rehmannia and the root of a certain herb (艹舌). For tidal fever, add Bupleurum and the bark of Lycium. If thirst is unquenchable, add Anemarrhena and red mung beans. For irritability, add Goji berries and Asparagus. If there&#39;s diarrhea, add Magnolia bark. If there is a lot of pus, add Angelica and Chuanxiong. For severe pain, add Peony and Frankincense. If muscles are slow to develop, add White Phosphorus and Cinnamon. If there is wind evil, add Angelica and Siler. For palpitations, add Cinnabar. For involuntary eye movements, add Notopterygium and Asarum. For nausea and vomiting, add Clove and Artemisia. For excessive phlegm, add Pinellia and Dried Tangerine Peel.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Heart Method of Danxi</strong><br><em>By Zhu Zhenheng during the Yuan Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Boils and sores are simply a result of heat overpowering blood.<br>The six Yang meridians and six Yin meridians each have varying conditions: some have more Qi and less blood, some have less Qi and more blood, and some have both abundant Qi and blood; these cannot be treated uniformly. As for crucial points, those near the areas of deficiency, weakness, and thinness have been previously discussed by sages, but the details have not been widely noted in the texts. Among all the meridians, only the Shaoyang and Jueyin meridians are known to develop boils and sores, and thus they should be proactively prevented, as they have more Qi and less blood, making muscle growth difficult and causing wounds to heal slowly, ultimately leading to serious conditions. Rapidly using detoxifying and purging medicines to attack the Yin aspect of the blood can lead to calamity in no time.  </p>
<p>When Yang is stagnant in Yin, the pulse is floating, rapid, and wiry; when Yin is stagnant in Yang, the pulse is deep, thin, weak, and slippery. Treat Yang stagnation with cold and Yin stagnation with heat.<br>For individuals after middle age, boils should not occur. If there is just pain and swelling, along with signs from the pulse, which only show weakness, then nourishing Qi and blood should be given to ensure a favorable outcome.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>If one uses ordinary medicines to dispel heat, draw out toxins, and soothe qi, the harm may only be as evident as pointing fingers. </p>
<p>As for the method of internal support: in Hejian, treating swelling and burning on the surface, the root of the condition is not deep; the symptoms are superficial, and the pulse is often floating. If the disease resides in the skin and flesh, unless the qi is strong, it must have invaded internally. Urgent internal support is necessary to rescue the inner state, and one should prepare decoctions to eliminate moisture and soothe stagnation, ensuring the stomach qi is harmonious. </p>
<p>If conditions persist, re-decoct half the dosage and drink it. If there is constipation and heat, take a small amount of Huanglian Decoction. If there are slight loose stools and the heat has retreated, again take half a dose of the decoction. This way, both nourishment and protection can function together, preventing evil qi from causing internal injury.</p>
<p>However, the common practice often relies on pus-dispersing and internal supplementing methods like Shixuansan. Such remedies may be fine for minor sores or in winter seasons, but for ulcers in summer, using heating dispersing ingredients like cinnamon and wood can be concerning, even with ginseng and astragalus; it is difficult to rely on them.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>When sores first develop, they appear as swelling, caused by the accumulation of qi and blood, which transforms into pus within the flesh, resulting in more pain than at the beginning of the sore. After the pus is discharged, the swelling recedes and the flesh relaxes; thus, the pain must gradually lessen. If the pain returns, it indicates deficiency, and one should tonify. There may also be cases where foul qi is involved, requiring harmonization. If it is due to an invasion of wind and cold, warmth and dispersal are recommended.</p>
<p>The modified All-Inclusive Decoction is used to replenish qi and blood after treating abscesses, advancing diet is crucial. This is because excessive discharge of pus and blood leads to deficiency in both yin and yang; without this medicine, how can one revive life? It is regrettable that practitioners do not differentiate between channels and meridians, nor do they adhere to seasonal considerations, and thus their understanding is merely superficial. Nowadays in surgery, when the swelling of wounds subsides and the pain eases, practitioners often mistakenly assume all is well without further investigation, resulting in deficiency symptoms appearing two or three months or even half a year after scabbing.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The physician fails to observe, and the patient does not understand, which results in a lack of beneficial care and adjustments, leading to the transformation of the illness into another. How regrettable! I treated a man who sought help for weak feet; his hands were both swollen and slightly throbbing, his appetite was normal, yet he could not answer my questions, and his skin had white flakes resembling flour. It was winter, and I treated him as if he were extremely weak. Upon inquiring with his brother, I learned that six months prior, he had developed sores on his arm, back, and legs, which had emerged in cycles from summer to autumn and winter. He had been treated with Five-Spice and Forsythia Decoction, and the Ten Xuan Powder, and the sores had long since scabbed over. I prepared a ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, and angelica ointment, using Er Chen Decoction to dissolve it. After three days and consuming a pound of the medicine, most of the white flakes disappeared. The patient was pleased, his breathing became strong, and I expected the tonics to show gradual effect; however, the family instead complained that the medicine didn’t work quickly and insisted on treating according to their own theory of wind illness. They refined two and a half qian of green stone and used Qingzhou white pills as the ingredient, boiling it into a decoction for immediate consumption. I advised against this, but they did not listen, and thus he was not saved. I wrote to caution them.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p>
<h3>Pain Disorders</h3>
<p>For unbearable pain from sores, use bitter and cold medicines combined with Huang Lian and Huang Qin, detailing the application according to the roots and channels involved. It is also said that for all sores, Dang Gui and Huang Lian serve as the main ingredients, with Lian Qiao, Gan Cao, and Huang Qin as assistants. </p>
<p>Sores that are painful and itchy are related to fire. If the individual has a strong constitution, the formula Si Wu should be supplemented with Da Cheng Qi Decoction. For those who are impatient, dark, thin, and suffering from hot blood, resulting in pain from sores, use Si Wu with Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Da Li Zi, and Gan Cao. For issues in the lower region, add Huang Bo. If the person is overweight, and experiencing painful sores due to damp heat, use Fang Feng, Qiang Huo, Jing Jie, Bai Zhi, Cang Zhu, and Lian Qiao to counteract the damp condition.</p>
<p>For various sores: for pus-filled conditions, focus on treating heat, dryness, and dampness, using unnamed medicines; for dry eczema, emphasize dispersing stagnation with Wu Yao. For insect sores resembling moss, prioritize relieving heat and killing parasites using Wu Yao, Hei Gou Ji, Bai Fan, Xiong Huang, and Sulfur, with Mercurial compounds for pest control, and add camphor and rosin as necessary. </p>
<p>If there is a heavy presence on the head, add Huang Lian, Fang Jie Shi, and She Chuang to relieve itching and kill parasites. For abscesses, use Song Pi Yan, adding Bai Zhi to alleviate stagnation if there is excess. In cases of severe pain, increase Bai Zhi and Fang Jie Shi. If insect presence is high, incorporate Li Lu and Chan Mao. For excessive itching, add Ku Fan. For scrotal sores, apply Wu Yao. In cases of dampness, adjust with fragrant oil. </p>
<p>For dry itch accompanied by significant bleeding, add Da Huang, Huang Lian, and pig fat for adjustment. If red, add Huang Dan; if blue, use Qing Dai. For a heavy presence of insects, include Xi Hui and Wu Yao along with Bing Lang.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Boils and Sores</p>
<p>For boils, puncture the head with a needle or knife and apply toad venom. Afterwards, mix mung beans and wild chrysanthemums with wine from a type of grass, drink until intoxicated, and sleep. The pain and heat will definitely subside without needing to remove the boil; it will heal itself. To treat all kinds of sores, use purple stem chrysanthemums, where the roots, stems, and leaves can all be used. Grind them to extract the juice and drop it into the mouth to drink.</p>
<p>Essential Principles of Surgery 【Yuan, Qi Dezhi】</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment Method</p>
<p>The physician is the guardian of life. The pulse is the main pursuit of medicine. If a physician does not understand the pulse, it is like walking in the dark without a path, easily leading to disaster. The diagnosis for major pulses, women, and children’s ailments must be carried out before prescribing medicine. However, in the case of sores, many practitioners tend to overlook pulse diagnosis, focusing solely on external treatment. When faced with difficult conditions, they may call for specific pulse diagnoses but still begrudgingly accept superficial understanding. Alas, how trivial this is! The occurrence of boils and swellings arises from the imbalance of yin and yang, leading to stagnation of qi and blood. Without diagnosis, how can one discern the strengths and weaknesses of yin and yang or the gathering and dispersing of blood and qi? From this perspective, it is essential to trust the treatment of sores and swellings to the method of diagnosis; it cannot be neglected.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Throughout history, there have been many texts on the treatment of sores and swellings, but the methods of diagnosis and symptoms have often been briefly mentioned and lacking in detail, particularly when compared to other medical specialties. Although I am unskilled, I have endeavored to compile insights from works such as the &quot;Huangdi Neijing,&quot; &quot;Nanjing,&quot; &quot;Lingshu,&quot; &quot;Jia Yi,&quot; as well as from famous medical practitioners like Shuhe, Zhongjing, Bianque, Huatuo, and writings like &quot;Qianjin,&quot; &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; &quot;Shenghui,&quot; and &quot;Zonglu,&quot; focusing on the diagnosis of sores and swellings. </p>
<p>I have organized these concepts, first outlining the methods of diagnosis, then discussing the sources of blood, qi, and the colors and pulses associated with them. Finally, I clarify the names and characteristics of pulses, their related symptoms, and the responses seen in sores and swellings. This should help those in the field of sore and swelling treatment to clearly understand what they read without any uncertainty, so that when faced with a patient, they can diagnose effectively, assessing the situation with clarity, as straightforward as distinguishing black from white.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p>
<h3>The Method of Correlating Color and Pulse for Nourishing and Protecting</h3>
<p>The principle of heaven and earth is known as Yin and Yang; within humans, Yin and Yang manifest as blood and Qi. Blood represents nourishment, while Qi represents defense. Nourishment resides within, and defense resides outside, thus nourishment flows within the meridians and defense circulates externally. The pulse is the precursor of blood and Qi. Without the pulse, how can blood nourish within? Without the pulse, how can Qi protect outside? The two support and move together, internally connecting to the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians, and externally moistening the nine orifices, four limbs, hundreds of joints, and countless hairs, circulating day and night in an endless loop, forming a continuous rhythm that converges at the wrist and manifests in the pulse. Therefore, it is said: Qi and blood are the spirit of a person. The pulse is the spirit of Qi and blood. Thus, at the beginning of treating illness, the five determinants serve as the criterion. The five determinants are the color pulses of the five organs. The pulse corresponds within while the color corresponds outside; the correspondence of color and pulse should be mutually referenced. Hence, it is said that a harmonious combination of color and pulse can ensure total well-being. When practicing medicine, one must first regulate and clarify color and pulse; if one is not proficient in this, even if they are intelligent and knowledgeable, they are still unworthy of trust.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>On the Method of Holding the Pulse and Observing Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The practice of diagnosing by observing the pulse typically begins at dawn. At this time, the yin energy has not dispersed, the yang energy has not stirred, food has not yet been ingested, blood flow is not chaotic, the meridians are not prominent, and the collateral vessels are balanced. Therefore, it is possible to diagnose pulses that are in excess. However, in cases of sudden illness, one should not rigidly adhere to this principle. As mentioned in the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; the proper method of pulse-taking is to maintain a state of tranquility and calmness. One should focus the mind, regulate breath, observe the essence clearly, examine the five colors, listen to sounds, and inquire about the patient&#39;s suffering; only then should one begin to press on the pulse at the wrist and differentiate between floating and sinking pulses. By using this approach, one can make distinctions that may determine life and death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one should consider the patient&#39;s body shape—tall or short, fat or thin, young or old, male or female—as well as their temperament, which can vary greatly. Thus, it is said: those whose body and energy are well-matched will thrive, while those with imbalances will fall ill. For example, the pulse of a maiden should be soft and weak, while that of an infant should be fine and rapid. For children around three to four years old, the pulse should be around seven to eight beats; this is considered normal and is quite different from that of an average adult.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Generally, men should first diagnose the left hand, while women should first diagnose the right hand. If a man&#39;s left pulse is strong, it indicates order; if a woman&#39;s right pulse is strong, it indicates order. When diagnosing the pulse, begin by using the middle finger to press against the high bone at the back of the palm; below the bone is the &quot;Guan&quot; position. Once the Guan position is identified, place the fingers evenly on both sides. For individuals with long arms, space the fingers widely; for those with short arms, space them closely. Once the three fingers are stable, first diagnose the upper finger, called &quot;Cunkou&quot;. Press lightly to feel the response, then press moderately, heavily, and finally, observe responses from above and below. Assess by pushing outward and inward, then proceed to examine the &quot;Guan&quot; and &quot;Chi&quot; positions in the same manner. If you find differences in the three sections between floating and sinking, slippery and rough, slow and fast, and an imbalance in the pulse, identify the related illness by examining the external appearance and internal pulse conditions. Take a detailed approach to diagnosis and treatment, providing faithful advice. One must not speak lightly or laugh, engage in idle gossip, glance about, or behave carelessly; such conduct is characteristic of an incompetent physician.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p>
<h3>The Theory of Diagnosing Diseases based on the Three Positions of the Pulse</h3>
<p>The way of diagnosing signs is difficult for physicians. Unless they toil diligently beneath the lamp, commit their knowledge to memory, consult with teachers and friends, and remain unceasing both day and night—fluctuating between wakefulness and sleep, bowing and looking up, with their minds focused on this—how can they comprehend the profound mysteries? The ancients said: &quot;By feeling the pulse, one can know the disease; this is called &#39;spirit,&#39; for it helps one understand the intricacies of inquiry.&quot; They also said: &quot;By palpating the pulse to treat the disease, this is referred to as &#39;skill,&#39; which clarifies the importance of distinguishing the nuances of the pulse.&quot; Indeed, the three fingers may seem close apart by mere millimeters, yet they point to diseases that could be thousands of miles away. Observing the skill of distinguishing between pulses, people consider it to be challenging and call it &#39;spirit&#39;; is it not something that can be easily achieved? Upon examining the classics, there are three positions of the pulse: Inch, Bar, and Foot. From the base of the thumb to the highest bone, we travel one inch to signify &#39;Inch&#39;; one division above &#39;Inch&#39; indicates the base of the thumb; from &#39;Inch&#39; to &#39;Foot&#39; indicates &#39;Foot Depth.&#39; The area after &#39;Inch&#39; and before &#39;Foot&#39; corresponds to the &#39;Bar,&#39; where the front of the Bar is Yang, represented by the Inch position. The back of the Bar is Yin, represented by the Foot position.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The yang emerges and the yin enters, with the guan (barrier) as the boundary. The cun (inch) corresponds to the upper jiao&#39;s head, hand, and skin; the guan corresponds to the middle jiao&#39;s abdomen and waist; and the chi (foot) corresponds to the lower jiao&#39;s lower abdomen and feet. These three areas represent the major parts. The left and right hands correspond to three parts each, referred to as the six vessels. Additionally, there are the renying (human meeting), qikou (qi mouth), and shenmen (spirit door), each having different associations. The left hand in front of the guan is called renying, and the right hand in front of the guan is called qikou; the division after both guans is called shenmen. Thus, the pulse commentary states: the liver and heart are associated with the left, while the lungs and spleen are associated with the right. The kidneys and mingmen (life gate) both correspond to the chi. The soul and spirit and the valley spirit are all seen at the cun. The area in front of the left hand guan corresponds to the heart, whose meridian is associated with the shaoyin (lesser yin) and corresponds with the taiyang (greater yang) of the hand, with the small intestine as its fu (organ). The area above the left hand guan corresponds to the liver, whose meridian is associated with the jueyin (absolute yin) of the foot, corresponding with the shaoyang (lesser yang) of the foot, with the gallbladder as its fu. The area behind the left hand guan corresponds to the kidneys, whose meridian is associated with the shaoyin of the foot, corresponding with the taiyang of the foot, with the bladder as its fu.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The right wrist, at the front, corresponds to the lung region, associated with the hand’s Taiyin channel, which is paired with the hand’s Yangming, together forming the large intestine as a hollow organ. The right wrist, at the top, corresponds to the spleen region, associated with the foot’s Taiyin channel, which is paired with the foot’s Yangming, together forming the stomach as a hollow organ. The right wrist, at the back, corresponds to the Mingmen region, associated with the hand’s Jueyin channel, which is paired with the hand’s Shaoyang, together forming the Sanjiao as a hollow organ. This discusses the significance of the six regions governing the organs and the twelve channels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the &quot;Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis&quot; states: on both sides within the wrist, it pertains to the lower ribs; the outer wrist assesses the kidneys, while the inner wrist assesses the abdomen. Above the wrist, the outer side examines the liver, and the inner side examines the diaphragm; on the right, the outer side checks the stomach, and the inner side checks the spleen. Above that, the outer side checks the lungs, and the inner side assesses the chest; on the left, the outer side checks the heart, and the inner side assesses the Zhongdan (the middle of the chest), the front checks the front, and the back checks the back. The uppermost area relates to matters of the throat and chest, while the lowermost refers to matters of the lower abdomen, waist, thigh, knee, and foot. If the pulse is coarse and large, it indicates a deficiency in Yin and an excess in Yang, which corresponds to internal heat.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>When coming quickly and going slowly, with fullness above and emptiness below, it indicates a rapid condition; when coming slowly and going quickly, with emptiness above and fullness below, it indicates a harmful wind. Therefore, when one suffers from a wind stroke, the yang qi is affected. If the pulse is both deep and thin, it indicates a condition of lesser yin deficiency. If the pulse is deep, thin, and scattered, it indicates issues of cold and heat. A floating and scattered pulse indicates a collapse. All floating and rapid pulses are in the yang and suggest heat, and those accompanied by agitation are found in the hands. When the pulse is both thin and deep, it relates to the yin, suggesting bone pain, with still conditions in the feet. A rapid pulse that changes is indicative of a disease in the yang pulse, leading to discharge of purulent blood. Those in excess are indicative of abundant yang qi, while slippery pulses show excessive yin qi. An abundance of yang qi results in heat in the body without sweating, while excess yin qi leads to excessive sweating and coldness. When both yin and yang are in excess, there is no sweating and coldness in the body. Pushing outward without revealing internal conditions suggests a build-up in the heart and abdomen. Pushing inward without revealing outward signs suggests heat in the body. If you push upwards and there is no downward movement, it indicates clarity in the waist and feet. Pushing downwards without upward response suggests pain in the head and neck. Pressing down to the bone or the pulse with little qi indicates pain in the lower back and a sensation of numbness throughout the body.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>The aforementioned ailments, if not clearly understood, how can one fully grasp their subtleties? Moreover, according to the discussions on the healthy person’s vital signs: when one inhales, the pulse moves once; when one exhales, the pulse also moves once. When breathing is steady, the pulse moves five times, harmonizing with the essence of vitality. It should be neither large nor small, neither long nor short, neither smooth nor rough, neither floating nor sinking, neither slow nor rapid; this is called the healthy person. A healthy person is one who is not ill. This is because the regular vital energy of a healthy person comes from the stomach. The stomach&#39;s energy is the fundamental energy of a healthy person. Therefore, since people consistently draw energy from the stomach, the pulse is fundamentally based on stomach energy. The &quot;Classic of Correct Theories&quot; states: when grain enters the stomach, the pulse pathway circulates. The &quot;Spirit Pivot Classic&quot; says: the stomach is the sea of water and grains. It also states: the pulse responds according to the four seasons, which indicates health. Indeed, the pulses corresponding to the four seasons are all based on stomach energy, namely: spring is the string-like pulse, summer is the rushing pulse, autumn is the hairy pulse, and winter is the stony pulse. The pulse in spring, subtle and string-like, is termed healthy. The others follow this pattern. Failing to adhere to the four seasons results in illness.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>When diagnosing a woman&#39;s pulse, if she is pregnant, one must be careful not to indiscriminately prescribe decoctions or powders. If the pulse of the woman indicates a very active shaoyin pulse, she is likely to be with child. Furthermore, it is said: when yin overtakes yang, there is a child. It is also stated: a body that sweats but has no pulse is indeed pregnant. In treating a heavily pregnant individual, it is essential to inquire about her monthly cycle and observe her physical appearance before deciding on the treatment; this must not be neglected. The texts further state: observe color and feel the pulse, first differentiate between yin and yang. For yin and yang are the principles of heaven and earth. Therefore, those who treat illness must seek the root cause, which lies in the principles of yin, yang, seasonal changes, and the five internal organs. In terms of pulse, it refers to its floating and sinking nature. In anatomical terms, it refers to its measurements. The texts therefore say: the pulse is a method of yin and yang that corresponds to the five internal organs. This is to say, when exhaling, it involves the heart and lungs, and when inhaling, it involves the kidneys and liver; in the cycle of breathing, the spleen assimilates food flavors, and its pulse resides in between. Considering floating and sinking, the floating represents yang, and the sinking represents yin. In relation to the organs, a pulse that is floating and widely dispersed corresponds to the heart, while a floating and short pulse corresponds to the lungs; hence, both the heart and lungs are considered floating.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The liver is firm and long, its pulse is strong; when pressed down, the kidneys can be felt. Thus, both the liver and kidneys are considered to be sinking. The spleen is slow and long, being situated in the center, hence the pulse is found there. Zhongjing said: A large, floating, rapid, moving, and slippery pulse indicates Yang; a sinking, weak, thin, and subtle pulse indicates Yin. Yang represents heat, while Yin represents cold. Therefore, in cold conditions, the pulse is sinking and slow, and in heat, it is floating and rapid. Thus, it is said that all rapid pulses indicate heat, and all slow pulses indicate cold. This is how one verifies it. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: all floating pulses indicate wind; all tight pulses indicate pain; all hidden pulses indicate accumulation; all thin pulses indicate thirst. A hollow pulse signifies blood loss; a long pulse indicates the resolution of qi, while a short pulse signifies qi illness. A weak pulse signifies restlessness, a large pulse indicates progression of illness, a floating pulse signifies surface issues, a sinking pulse signifies internal issues, a slow pulse indicates issues in the organs, and a rapid pulse indicates issues in the bowels. Furthermore, a robust body with a thin pulse and insufficient breath is dangerous. A thin body with a large pulse and abundant qi in the chest is fatal. When body and qi complement each other, there is life; when the three or five patterns are not in harmony, there is illness. When the three regions and nine positions are all out of balance, there is death.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>This is the great method of the sages for diagnosing pulses. Therefore, it is said: In treating illness, one must observe the shape, vitality, color, and texture, and treat accordingly without delay. Those whose shape and vitality are in harmony are alive, while those whose color and texture are superficial are easily afflicted. Pulses that follow the four seasons can be treated, while weak and slippery pulses indicate gastric energy, and these are all easily treated. However, if the shape and vitality are discordant, or if the color is lacking in luster, and the pulse reverses the four seasons, or if the pulse is strong and firm, these cannot be treated. The classic text states that one must observe the four difficulties and clearly inform the patient. Additionally, if the illness is hot with a calm pulse, or if there is diarrhea with a strong pulse, or if there is blood loss with a solid pulse, or if there is restlessness after sweating, these are all difficult to treat. For those with sores or abscesses, if there is a large discharge of pus and blood, and the pulse is slippery and rapid, it is difficult to treat. Generally, if there is a large purulent discharge, or if it resembles clear fluid, and the pulse is slippery and widely dispersed with symptoms of cold, heat, and thirst, treatment will be ineffective. If lung sores are present, with coughing up pus and blood and a pulse that feels surging and slippery, treatment will be difficult for recovery. In general, if the pulse is floating and rapid, there should be fever but a reaction of aversion to cold, accompanied by tension in the head and neck, and discomfort in the limbs, or if there is shivering and severe thirst, there will be a painful area wanting to swell.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>The Twenty-Six Types of Pulses and Their Corresponding Diagnoses</strong></p>
<p>The pulse can generally be categorized into twenty-six types, which serve as a framework for pulse diagnosis. In detail, even slight discrepancies may lead to significant misdiagnoses. In summary, the analysis revolves around the concepts of Yin and Yang, and the interplay of deficiency and excess. In consideration of various diagnostic traditions, this text condenses their essential points while eliminating superfluities to convey their core meanings.</p>
<p>The floating pulse is felt beneath the fingers; pressing down does not reveal it, but lifting it does; when sought repeatedly, it appears overly pronounced, glancingly observable between the skin and flesh. Its significance relates to superficial conditions, possibly attributable to wind or deficiency. A floating and broadly dispersed pulse indicates issues with the heart, while a floating and short pulse points to the lungs. A floating and rapid pulse suggests heat; if it is rapid without heat but instead accompanied by chills, it indicates sores or ulcers.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>The diagnosis of the flood pulse is characterized by a large and superficial feel, with a broad press that fills all three regions, resembling the rushing flow of water and the surging of waves. It indicates an accumulation of heat and swelling in the blood. It is stated: a large flood pulse suggests the progression of sores and boils. If a sore or boil has yet to form pus, it is advisable to drain it. After the pus has erupted, if the pulse is seen as large and flood-like, treatment is difficult; if there is spontaneous diarrhea, it cannot be treated.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the slippery pulse is characterized by a combination of fullness and largeness, flowing smoothly like pearls, and when pressed, it feels slippery. It indicates either heat or deficiency; this is a yang pulse. In the case of sores and boils, if the pus has not yet erupted, it is advisable to internally dispel it. Once the pus has erupted, it is advisable to aid in expulsion. This is referred to as beginning with heat and ending in deficiency.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the rapid pulse, when pressed, moves with breathing, influencing the six positions; it appears slippery and rapid. If it is superficial and rapid, it indicates exterior heat; if it is deep and rapid, it indicates internal heat. Furthermore, it is said: all rapid pulses suggest heat. Zhongjing stated: if the pulse is rapid and not observed at regular times, it indicates the development of severe sores.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>It is also said that if the lung pulse is abundant and rapid, it results in sores. When diagnosing a pulse that is abundant and rapid, it indicates that there is likely purulent accumulation inside. </p>
<p>The diagnosis of a scattered pulse appears floating and dispersed; pressing it reveals that it disperses and is prone to leaving; lifting it shows it is large but weak. This indicates that the energy is abundant, but the blood is deficient, with an exterior presence but an interior absence. After sores and swelling have burst with pus, and the pain persists without healing, the pulse will be abundant, slippery, coarse, and scattered, making it difficult to treat due to the deficiency of the righteous Qi and the presence of pathogenic Qi. It is also stated that if the limbs feel heavy and the lung pulse is large, it results in death, which refers to the floating and dispersing pulse.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of a hollow pulse, it appears floating and soft; when pressed, it is empty in the center but firm on both sides. This indicates blood deficiency or may be indicative of blood loss leading to sores and swelling. If a hollow pulse is detected, it can be treated easily after the pus bursts, as the pulses correspond to the ailment. </p>
<p>In the diagnosis of a long pulse, it feels abundant and long upon pressure, arising from its original position. This indicates excess of Yang Qi.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>In cases of cold damage, if one desires to sweat it out for relief, the pulse that is long and slow corresponds to the stomach channel; it indicates that all diseases can be cured, which is called &#39;long&#39; meaning the qi is regulated. </p>
<p>For diagnosing a solid pulse, when pressing it, it feels large and tense, both deep and superficial, conveying a strong solidity. If there are nodules or swellings due to scrofula and a solid pulse is detected, should one not reduce it internally?</p>
<p>In diagnosing a solid pulse, pressing it reveals strength, resembling a knot, thus deemed solid. The classics state: when evil qi prevails, it presents as solid, and in chronic illness, it tends to be vacuous. This condition is most to be avoided. For those suffering from sores and boils who exhibit this pulse, it is advisable to purge urgently, as the evil qi and the organs are both solid.</p>
<p>For diagnosing a wiry pulse, pressing it feels tight and taut; if it appears tense, it is termed wiry. It feels rigid like an unyielding string, and unlike the common sensation of motion, it remains firm. A spring pulse that is floating and wiry but not often observed indicates fluid stagnation leading to pain, signifying coldness and vacuity. In discussions on sores and boils, it is said: a wiry pulse clashes with a surging one, indicating external tension and internal heat, suggesting the impending development of sores and boils.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The examination of the tight pulse feels like a string that is taut; pressing it reveals a rope-like quality that twists. It indicates cutting pain and accumulation. If there is an ulcer or swelling, it reflects stagnation of qi and blood, also implying pain.</p>
<p>The examination of the sluggish pulse shows that pressing it disperses and it returns. When lifted, it feels thin and insufficient. A sluggish pulse indicates stagnation of qi and also suggests blood deficiency. After an ulcer or swelling bursts, this pulse may not be detrimental.</p>
<p>The examination of the short pulse shows that when pressed or lifted, it does not reach its original position. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: a short pulse indicates qi illness, as it lacks stomach qi. Diseases with a short pulse are generally difficult to treat. In cases of ulcers and swellings, a short pulse indicates a deficiency of true qi.</p>
<p>The examination of the thin pulse feels like a web thread that is about to snap when pressed and feels almost absent when lifted, fine and delicate, indicating a decline in yang. In ulcer and swelling diseases, a thin pulse that is deep yet occasionally direct indicates interior deficiency with a tendency to change patterns.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The diagnosis of a fine pulse is that when pressed, it feels soft, small, and extremely subtle, indicating deficiency. If the vital energy is restored, life is possible; if the evil energy prevails, danger arises. After a sore or swelling has ruptured, if the pulse is fine and even, it signifies recovery.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of a slow pulse is that when lifted, it comes up slowly, and only with steady breathing can there be three beats; its appearance is somewhat slow but slightly delayed. In chronic diseases, this pulse is favorable; in new diseases, it indicates exhausted vital energy. After sores or swellings have ruptured, it will heal itself.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of a relaxed pulse shows a resemblance to a slow pulse, but it is slightly quicker. Zhong Jing said: A yang pulse that is floating, large, and moist, and a yin pulse that is also floating, large, and moist, are both referred to as relaxed when yin and yang are equal. A long and relaxed pulse indicates recovery from numerous ailments. Generally, after sores or swellings have ruptured, if the pulse is dry, slow, and relaxed, healing is easy, as the pulse state corresponds to the presence of stomach energy.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of a deep pulse shows inadequacy when lifted; pressing it reveals it feels like rotten cotton, indicating that evil energy resides within the organs. If water energy is involved, it is adverse; this is the yin pulse. In the case of sores or swellings, it signifies deep evil energy.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>The diagnosis of the submerged pulse is characterized by a deep and suppressed feeling; when lifted, it cannot be felt, and pressing it reveals the bone, resembling the submerged type but with the pathogenic qi deeper. </p>
<p>The diagnosis of the empty pulse exhibits an insufficient pressure, slow yet large and soft, lifting the fingers reveals a sudden emptiness beneath. The classics state: &quot;When the pulse is empty, the blood is empty; empty blood generates cold, indicating insufficient yang energy.&quot; For ulcers and swellings with an empty pulse, it is advisable to tonify the inside, harmonize qi, and nourish blood.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the soft pulse feels like silk in water—extremely soft, deep, and fine; it is also termed moist. This indicates weak stomach qi. For ulcers and swellings, one should nourish the deficiency and expel pus.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the weak pulse resembles the soft pulse but is very faint, coming late and seeming to exist. Zhongjing stated: &quot;The faint and weak pulse feels as fine as the end of a leak; it indicates both blood and qi are deficient, and the body’s essence is insufficient.&quot; Generally, for ulcers, the submerged, slow, moist, and weak pulses all warrant inner support.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the rushing pulse shows a rapid succession, with pauses before returning.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Zhongjing said: When yang is strong, it quickens the pulse, indicating heat accumulates internally; if you purge it, it harmonizes. When there are sores and swelling with a rapid pulse, it too must be purged urgently. </p>
<p>In the diagnosis of a knotted pulse, when pressed, it has a slow and intermittent rhythm, sometimes ceasing only to return. Zhongjing said: When yin is strong, it causes knots. The classic states: If the pulse is rapid and knotted, life is present; if it is intermittent, death is imminent. </p>
<p>In the diagnosis of an intermittent pulse, when pressed, it shows a rhythm, but when it moves, it halts and cannot return, and then moves again; this is called an intermittent pulse. An intermittent pulse indicates weakened qi, and its presence in various illnesses is ominous. Generally, diseases of sores and swelling with rapid and knotted pulses are difficult to treat, let alone those with an intermittent pulse.</p>
<p>In the diagnosis of a deep pulse, it is felt at the guan position, without beginning or end, as large as a bean, and it trembles erratically. The “Pulse Classic” states: Yin and yang clash, hence it is called movement. Movement in yang indicates deficient yang qi and leads to fainting; movement in yin indicates deficient yin qi and leads to fever. Yang is generated at the wrist and moves at the inch; yin is generated at the inch and moves at the wrist; this must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p>
<h3>Symptoms Associated with the Three Regions of Pulse</h3>
<p>The &quot;cùn,&quot; &quot;guān,&quot; and &quot;chǐ&quot; refer to the positions of the pulse. &quot;Fú,&quot; &quot;chén,&quot; &quot;huá,&quot; and &quot;mèn&quot; represent the qualities of the pulse. Establishing the position and understanding the signs indicated by the pulse are the essential methods of diagnosis. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: Generally, if the pulses in both hands across the three regions are smooth and slow, neither floating nor sinking, neither long nor short, and are even in their rhythm, there is no illness.</p>
<p>A floating pulse at the cùnkǒu indicates a wind injury; a tight pulse indicates a cold injury; a string-like pulse suggests an injury from food. A floating and relaxed pulse indicates a stroke; a floating and rapid pulse indicates a headache. A floating and tight pulse suggests cold above the diaphragm and cold drinks below the ribs. A sinking and tight pulse indicates underlying cold and accumulated pain in the heart area. A sinking and weak pulse indicates deficiency damage; a relaxed and slow pulse suggests cold deficiency; a faint pulse indicates both blood and qi deficiency. A string-like pulse indicates headache with fluid in the heart area. A double string-like pulse suggests pain under both ribs. An incomplete pulse indicates lack of progress; a completely absent pulse suggests no treatment available. A pulse that feels like thick soup indicates weak yang qi; a consistent, thin pulse like spider silk indicates declining yang qi.</p>
<p>The guān region governs matters of the central and abdominal areas. If the pulse is steady and slow, there is no illness. A floating pulse indicates fullness in the abdomen with lack of appetite, suggesting a weak stomach. A slippery pulse indicates heat in the stomach. A rapid pulse indicates heat accumulation in the central region.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>The沉伏者 indicates that there is water and phlegm in the middle burner, causing nausea and sour regurgitation. The weak refer to deficient stomach qi. Although there may be false heat, one should not attack it vigorously; care must be taken to prevent excess heat from leading to cold. If the pulse is firm and solid, it suggests abdominal fullness with gurgling sounds, blocked flow, and potentially intense pain, indicating qi counterflow. If the pulse is hollow, it may suggest blood loss. A firm, large pulse that does not diminish under pressure and feels strong indicates that the middle burner is solid, with a blockage contained in the stomach. A slightly floating pulse may indicate undigested food, as well as gut disturbances causing anxiety. </p>
<p>The尺脉 relates to the lower burner—waist, kidneys, and shins. A floating pulse indicates difficulties with wind heat affecting urination. A沉 pulse suggests pain in the lower back with insufficient kidney qi. A rapid pulse indicates heat and pain below the navel, with red urine and aversion to cold. A slow pulse signifies cold in the lower burner with yin deficiency. A tight pulse suggests urgent pain in the lower abdomen. A relaxed pulse may indicate weakness in the legs, swelling, or paralysis. A weak pulse points to cold below with declining kidney qi. A soft pulse indicates inability to retract the legs and difficulties with wind-induced paralysis affecting urination. A伏 pulse suggests abdominal pain from hernias, and food fails to digest. A thin pulse signifies loose stools and cold below. A hollow pulse indicates difficult urination with blood loss. A firm and small pulse suggests cold paralysis in the knees with pain in the feet. A thin and rapid pulse indicates muscle spasms making mobility difficult. An intermittent pulse suggests men may have stagnation in the lower abdomen, while women may experience menstrual issues.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>In the three sections, there is a consistent thread discussing various ailments. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: Yang pathogens are felt as floating and surging, while Yin pathogens present as subtle and fine. Pathogens from food and water appear as solid and firm, and chills manifest as thin and tight. It further explains: a floating and slippery pulse indicates food stagnation, a short and slippery pulse signals a wine-related illness, a slow and slippery pulse points to bloating, a large and surging pulse suggests cold damage, a floating and rapid pulse indicates a cold from wind, a floating and urgent pulse signifies undigested food and an unrefined spleen, a sinking and tight pulse denotes a buildup of cold and Yin pain, a floating and relaxed pulse indicates skin numbness, a slippery and dispersed pulse signals paralysis, a slow and relaxed pulse points to cold symptoms, a floating and thin pulse indicates cholera, a weak and thin pulse suggests gastroesophageal reflux, a tight and slippery pulse indicates retching, a short and rapid pulse points to heart pain, a tight and rapid pulse indicates malaria, a tight and hurried pulse signifies corpse evocation, a solid yet small and firm pulse indicates a deep internal illness and coldness, a floating, slippery, and tight pulse suggests an external illness with heat, a short and urgent pulse indicates an upper body problem, a long and relaxed pulse suggests a lower body problem, a long and tight pulse indicates liver issues, a slippery and surging pulse signals heart problems, a subtle and soft pulse relates to spleen issues, a floating and thin pulse suggests lung issues, and a sinking and tight pulse indicates kidney problems. Additionally, it notes: all floating pulses can signify wind or deficiency, all tight pulses indicate pain or accumulation, all thin pulses relate to obstruction, all tightness points to fluid retention, all rapid pulses indicate heat, all slow pulses signify cold, a hollow pulse indicates blood loss, and a soft pulse indicates deficiency. If the pulse is deep and dense with numbness in the limbs, it indicates a loss of vitality; if it is large and knotted, it suggests a curse. If the pulse fluctuates between large and small, short and long, it indicates spiritual disturbance.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p>
<h3>Caution in Treating Quirks</h3>
<p>Generally, when sores or boils appear, they are often only the size of millet or sorghum grains, and their appearance is very slight. Many people do not take this seriously, but this conceals a great danger, and it is advisable to identify it quickly—one should not ignore it. If one can prevent it before it manifests, treat it before it develops, or recognize it in the morning and treat it by evening, and seek care from a skilled doctor, then there will certainly be no risks or difficulties. However, if one persists in procrastination and neglect, consulting incompetent doctors and allowing pus and blood to accumulate, leaving it to fate and waiting helplessly for death, is it not a long way from the right path? This can lead to the deterioration of muscles and bones, perforating internal organs, resulting in death for eight or nine out of ten cases. Should one not exercise caution? Those suffering from sores and boils who entrust their lives to incompetent doctors and act arbitrarily will face imminent danger. But if one seeks care from a skilled doctor, recovery can be ensured.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>When using medicine, one must be discerning; how difficult it is to distinguish! If one can read extensively, be familiar with symptoms, master herbal prescriptions, understand pulse and complexion, possess a kind and benevolent nature, uphold filial piety, loyalty, and trustworthiness, face situations without confusion, and make decisions judiciously, then one is a good doctor. Trust in their guidance without doubt. </p>
<p>Moreover, it is essential for the patient to self-control; they must not be filled with anger, sorrow, or distress, call out in fury, indulge in arrogance, be driven by appetites, or overexert themselves. It is best to remain tranquil and calm, and to be patient. </p>
<p>Keep the patient’s surroundings quiet and free of distractions; avoid loud noises, arguments, curses, and fights, as well as unclean people, alcohol, and other unpleasant odors. Animals and young children should be kept at a distance. If relatives or friends inquire about the patient’s illness, they should be advised to speak softly and attentively, respecting the situation and then stepping back to avoid causing disturbance or recalling past matters that could provoke unwelcome emotions. We must fear that the patient&#39;s state of mind may become despondent, and we should avoid hastily suggesting treatments or debating their validity, which could confuse the patient and lead to indecision. It is best to offer simple and convenient inquiries, avoiding long conversations that would wear out the patient; this is highly inappropriate.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Those who attend to patients should ideally be middle-aged, with a calm and sincere temperament, diligent, patient, compassionate, and wise. Their role is to adjust the porridge and medicine without missing the right timing. They must not allow the patient to be surrounded by whispers of lament or shedding of tears, which can deeply affect the patient and be quite harmful. </p>
<p>In terms of food and drink, one must be cautious and mindful of details; neglecting this is not permissible. Among livestock, one should avoid eating donkey, horse, camel, mule, pig, dog, cow, goat, and sheep, as well as mixed fish, turtle, crab, and anything that has died from illness or has a foul odor. Refrain completely from tasting such items. </p>
<p>Among birds, one should avoid eating goose, duck, swan, eagle, sparrow, crane, mandarin duck, heron, dove, crow, chicken, and thrush, as well as those that can imitate human speech. It is wise to avoid consuming these. </p>
<p>Among wild animals, avoid eating deer, fox, rabbit, tiger, leopard, bear, jackal, and those that have claws and teeth that can harm, as well as poisonous insects and creatures related by birth to one’s parents. Exercise caution and do not partake in these. </p>
<p>In terms of vegetables, one should avoid eating cucumbers, eggplant, blue ginger, mustard greens, coriander, lettuce, knotweed, mustard, mushrooms, bottle gourd, leeks, garlic, scallions, and shallots. Refrain from consuming these items.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Among fruit trees, it is advised to avoid eating peaches, apricots, jujubes, chestnuts, plums, pears, soft jujubes, persimmons, cherries, walnuts, hazelnuts, pine apples, and various unripe fruits, as well as insects. If there are sores, pus, swelling, or weakness of qi and blood, one may consume lamb, quail, turnips, ginger, pickled vegetables, radishes, and white or brown rice, including fine rice and thin porridge. If muscles start to develop and appetite increases, it is appropriate to eat white, cooked, flaky pastries, thin porridge, and soups that are soft and warm, neither too thick nor too thin, ensuring not to overeat. During this time, one should still avoid steamed buns, pastries, dumplings, wontons, meat pies, and fatty, greasy, or overly spicy foods. When the skin begins to heal, with harmful substances nearly expelled and the sores closing up, one should still refrain from standing, walking, greeting guests, attending banquets, becoming angry or taking baths, ascending or descending platforms, and engaging in strenuous activities, especially in varying temperatures that cause fatigue. It is crucial to regulate diet and maintain careful intake until the sores and scars heal completely, the spirit remains the same, and strength is fully restored. For a hundred days, one must be cautious and avoid transgressions.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p>
<h3>On the Theory of Xu and Shi (Void and Reality)</h3>
<p>In the case of sores and abscesses, when there is swelling and toxicity, and the condition is gravely serious, it is necessary to distinguish between the void and the reality. The void is difficult to replenish, while the reality is easy to leach. The methods of replenishing and leaching should not be taken lightly. If there is even a slight deviation, the consequences can be severe. </p>
<p>Moreover, the manifestations of the void and reality are manifold and cannot be overlooked. There are the void and reality of wounds, and within the organs, qi, blood, and the true or false conditions above and below, each has its own void and reality, hence the differences. </p>
<p>To discuss them separately: swollen and hard, with thick pus indicates the reality of the sore, while soft and swollen, with thin pus indicates the void. In cases of diarrhea with rumbling intestines, inability to take in food, vomiting at irregular times, cold hands and feet, weak pulse and cold skin, spontaneous urination, or difficulty urinating, along with slippery and frequent stools, lack of voice, and mental dullness, all point to the void of the organs. </p>
<p>On the other hand, hard stools, scanty urination, normal appetite, abdominal fullness and bloating, chest constriction and discomfort, pain in the limbs, bitter mouth and dry throat, irritability and excessive thirst, body heat and strong pulse, along with mental cloudiness, all indicate the reality of the organs.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>For all kinds of sores and boils, if the pus is clear and thin, the wound edges do not close, the pus does not appear red, and the flesh is cold and the skin pale, accompanied by spontaneous sweating, this indicates a deficiency of qi and blood. If there is swelling with redness, alternating cold and heat, pain in the skin, thick and sticky pus, and feelings of heaviness in the head, this indicates an excess of qi and blood. If there is headache and nasal congestion, red eyes and a shocked heart, difficulty in the throat, mouth sores, thirst for cold drinks, speaking while asleep and grinding teeth, this indicates an excess in the upper body. If there is smooth and unblocked flow, ease in bowel movements, heaviness in the waist and legs, and restlessness in sleep, this indicates a deficiency in the lower body. If there is discomfort in the shoulders and neck, heaviness in the limbs, inability to focus the gaze, diminished eyesight, indifference to food, hoarse voice and ashen appearance, with swelling in the limbs, this indicates a deficiency of true qi. If the swelling is severe, with intolerable pain, not resolving for several days, alternating cold and heat, constipation, painful urination, mental agitation, confusion, and restlessness, this indicates an excess of pathogenic qi. It is also said that when true qi is depleted, there is deficiency; when pathogenic qi prevails, there is excess. It is further stated that all pains are due to excess, while itching indicates deficiency. Additionally, when diagnosing, a pulse that is large and rapid denotes excess, while a pulse that is fine and soft indicates deficiency. For deficiency, one should nourish it and harmonize the qi, facilitating the flow. For excess, one should drain it, promoting smoothness and guiding the qi naturally. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if blood is in excess, it should be drained; if qi is deficient, it should be gently drawn out.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p>
<h3>Method of Differentiating Depth and Severity</h3>
<p>Wounds can manifest in various forms, and to discern their depth, one must follow established principles. If one lacks prior knowledge of medical theories and arbitrarily imposes personal interpretations, how can they adhere to the proper standards? I once heard that the ancients said: &quot;Too much leads to confusion, while too little brings understanding.&quot; Simply put, wounds can generally be classified into three categories: those that are raised and soft indicate an issue with the blood; those that are swollen and firm indicate a problem with the muscles and bones; and those where the flesh and skin colors are indistinguishable indicate a problem with the bone marrow. Furthermore, when treating wounds, if the swollen area is deeply rooted and large, it is deep; if it is small and floating, it is shallow. Also, if a person feels strong fever, chills, tightness, headaches, restless mind, and desires cold drinks at the onset of the wound, the condition is likely severe. Conversely, if a person feels balanced in their daily routine and maintains usual eating habits despite the wound, their condition is likely mild. When a malignant sore first appears, if its head resembles a grain of rice and there is slight pain or itchiness, touching it may cause it to spread; if this occurs, one should quickly take remedies like rhinoceros horn soup or reed decoction, as well as gas-dispersing pills to promote flow and relieve blockage, alongside the use of detoxifying baths. For milder conditions, gentle dressings should suffice. Thus, the distinction between depth and severity is crucial throughout the process.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p>
<h3>Differentiating Pus Method</h3>
<p>For diseases characterized by sores and swellings, where toxic qi has already congealed, one should not discuss methods to dissolve it internally. Instead, one must differentiate between the nature of the pus—its maturity and depth—without recklessly opening it. Assess whether it is permissible to proceed, to avoid dangerous outcomes. In general, with sores and boils, pressing firmly elicits pain, indicating deep pus; light pressure causing pain indicates superficial pus; and if pressing does not result in significant pain, pus has not yet formed. If pressing brings back pain, there is pus present; if not, there is none. If it isn’t pus, it must be water. If the swelling is soft and painless, it is a blood tumor. If the swelling gradually increases without severe heat, accompanied by occasional pulling pain, it indicates an air tumor. When air is trapped and slightly swollen, lingering without dissipating, it may later develop into pus; this is caused by the interplay of cold and heat. If accumulation persists for a long time, extreme yin can give rise to yang, causing cold to transform into heat, which often leads to the formation of fistulas upon rupture; therefore, it is advisable to take internal medicines early to alleviate it. For various goiters, warts, and other growths, they will all internalize and rupture with age. If treated while young, there may be no future concerns. Moreover, regarding the treatment of abscesses and boils, if one covers them with a hand, those that are very hot typically will soften and form pus.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>If the upper layer has a thin skin that has peeled off, the pus is shallow; if the swelling is not very hot, the pus has not yet formed. In cases of scrofulous tuberculosis, if there are chills and fever, thirst, and the condition has lasted for a long time without improvement, the person’s complexion will be sallow and yellow, suffering from heat rising; this indicates that pus has already formed. As for internal sores and abscesses in the viscera and intestines, the illness is hidden and not visible; as the eyes do not see, and the hands cannot approach, it is extremely difficult. One can diagnose by examining the pulse. If someone has a gastric abscess, one should examine the stomach pulse. The renying (meeting the person) pulse pertains to the stomach. If the pulse is deep and thin, it indicates rebellious qi, which can lead to heat accumulation in the stomach that does not disperse, resulting in an abscess in the epigastrium. If the pulse is flooding and rapid, the pus has already formed. If the pulse is slow and tight, though the pus has not fully developed, there is already stagnant blood, and it requires urgent treatment. Otherwise, the evil poison will attack internally, rotting the intestines and stomach, making it irreparable. Additionally, regarding lung abscesses, it is said: if it begins to emerge, it can be treated; if pus has formed, it leads to death. One must be cautious. If the pus is soft and resembles rice porridge for a long time, it should not be treated. If one vomits pus and then stops, it can heal on its own. Furthermore, regarding intestinal abscesses, it is said: if there is a sore around the navel and pus comes from the sore, if there is discharge from the navel, only those who have bloody pus with their stools can heal themselves.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Dialectics</strong></p>
<p>The terms for sores, boils, and swellings are numerous and varied, as recorded in many texts, leading to confusion. When faced with illness, treatment may lack foundation, resulting in uncertainty. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: those who understand the essentials can finish with a single word; those who do not can only wander endlessly. Though I may be lacking in talent, I will attempt to articulate the essentials. </p>
<p>Heat originating between the skin leads to small swellings, which can never exceed two or three fen; this is a boil. When heat accumulates in the six bowels and erupts between the outer muscles, causing severe swelling with shiny, soft skin that spreads broadly, this is a carbuncle. When wind heat from the five organs attacks the muscles and bones, and violent wind toxins appear, starting as a head like a withered white thorn, touching it evokes concern; this is a sore. Boils and carbuncles can spread from the six bowels, akin to a wildfire consuming everything, while sores originate in the five organs and are difficult to treat, like a fire in a pottery workshop consuming the marrow. Boils are easier to treat but healing can be slow due to the need for rest; sores are harder to treat but easier to recover from.</p>
<p>Both boils and sores should be cauterized when they first appear because their energy is superficial, allowing heat to disperse quickly. Sores, however, should be treated without cauterization because their energy is deep and must reach its source. All external sores and boils arise from internal heat and toxins. Understanding these three conditions, the characteristics of swellings and toxins can be inferred.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>When the skin slightly rises and the flesh thickens, causing pain or itchiness, if it is removed and does not adhere, it is called swelling. There are those caused by wind, and those caused by the clash of wind and heat, which result in hard, white swelling; if caused by heat, the swelling is red and hot; if caused by the clash of wind and heat, it persists for a long time. The heat dominates over the wind; if not treated promptly, blood will not circulate, and together with qi, it may lead to pus formation. </p>
<p>It is said that excessive wind leads to itching, while excessive heat leads to pain. This is a diagnostic sign. There is also a condition known as &quot;dan poison,&quot; where the body&#39;s skin suddenly turns red, resembling the application of a red pigment, thus named. In the vernacular, it is referred to as a &quot;red tumor.&quot; Sometimes it results from a wound that has been inadvertently touched, with surrounding areas becoming red and hot, referred to as a sore tumor. </p>
<p>All cases of dan poison are characterized by wandering, unpredictable symptoms that resemble clouds. Children are most susceptible to this condition. Within a hundred days, it is referred to as a &quot;fetal tumor&quot; because their qi and blood are tender and weak, and their organs are soft and fragile, making them unsuitable for needles or knives, which is why caution is advised. </p>
<p>There are also nodules that develop between the neck and armpits, initially resembling the size of a bean or the pit of a plum, connected in clusters, sometimes numbering three to five, persisting without resolution, gradually enlarging or causing chills and fever, known as scrofula. Those with wind poison acquire it from wind, those with heat poison from heat, and those with qi poison from qi, all arising from the accumulation of pathogenic wind and heat. The symptoms vary, and the methods of treatment should also differ accordingly.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Between Good and Evil Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Concerning sores and ulcers, it is essential to discern between good and evil conditions, as they can reverse their natures. Traditionally, when treating sores, five good signs and seven bad signs are mentioned, but this specifically refers to the symptoms associated with the inner organs of the stomach and intestines. For conditions such as scalp or brain ulcers, there are distinct good and evil signs discussed later.</p>
<p>The seven bad signs are as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Irritability accompanied by coughing, severe thirst with abdominal pain, excessive diarrhea, or painful urination; this is the first evil sign.  </li>
<li>Discharge of pus and blood exacerbated by swelling and inflammation, with foul-smelling pus, and severe pain that prevents touch; this constitutes the second evil sign.  </li>
<li>Abnormal vision, including tight and small black pupils, and discoloration of the whites of the eyes; this is the third evil sign.  </li>
<li>Shortness of breath with labored breathing, accompanied by confusion and excessive sleepiness; this represents the fourth evil sign.  </li>
<li>Discomfort in the shoulders and back, leading to a feeling of heaviness in the limbs; this is the fifth evil sign.  </li>
<li>Inability to eat, vomiting after taking medicine, and lacking any taste in food; this is the sixth evil sign.  </li>
<li>A hoarse voice with a pale complexion, blue or red lips and nose, and swelling of the face and limbs; this constitutes the seventh evil sign.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>When movement and rest are in harmony, and when food and drink are appreciated for their flavors, this is the first goodness; when convenience is adjusted and balanced, this is the second goodness; when pus dissipates and swelling subsides, and when water is fresh and odorless, this is the third goodness; when the spirit is vibrant and the voice is clear, this is the fourth goodness; when the body and energy are harmonious, this is the fifth goodness.</li>
</ol>
<p>When illness manifests with the seven evils, the skin may feel tight and as if it is good; when illness manifests with the five goodnesses, and the skin feels soft and weak as if it is bad. Such conditions are not to be understood lightly. If one only knows that the five goodnesses come together, then goodness cannot increase; if the seven evils come together, one encounters the utmost of evil. </p>
<p>In my humble opinion, when suffering from sores and abscesses, if among the five goodnesses one suddenly sees one or two signs of goodness, the sore will also heal; within the seven evils, if one suddenly sees one or two signs of evil, it should be greatly feared. Generally, if the signs of sores and abscesses show signs of evil within a state of deficiency, they are incurable; true signs without evil will heal themselves. </p>
<p>After pus is discharged, if discomfort and pain are not yet healed, if the pulse is large, slippery, coarse, and scattered, it is difficult to treat; if it is weak, slow, and subtle, it is easier to heal. These signs of goodness and evil can also be discerned during diagnosis. </p>
<p>For boils on the back or the head and other serious sores, if there are distinct signs of the five reversals—such as white eyes, a dark and black face, small eyes, vomiting after taking medicine, intense pain and thirst, discomfort in the lower neck, hoarse voice and pale complexion—these are the five reversals. Other symptoms like heat, thirst, diarrhea, and vomiting indicate that toxins have invaded internally, and the damage to the organs should be treated according to the signs.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Bian Gan Method</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, the size of bian stones was determined according to the nature of the illness. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that needles, bian stones, and gouge needles are essentially the same. Nowadays, the use of the sickle comes from the &quot;Complete Collection of Sacred Cures,&quot; which mentions using the sickle to cut out blood. This must not be delayed. Moreover, Bian Que states that for ailments in the blood vessels, they should be treated with bian stones. This corresponds to the &quot;Suwen,&quot; which mentions that blood stagnation should be released. The &quot;Treatise on Qi and Blood&quot; also states that when one&#39;s form is joyous, yet the mind is troubled, ailments arise from within and should be treated with bian stones. Bian stones, said to originate from the East, were used by the people there, who often suffered from sores and ulcers; therefore, the method of using bian stones is appropriate. The use of bian stones is guided by specific symptoms, not limited to just tumors. When one sees swelling with a red color that fluctuates unpredictably, it is urgent to employ the sickle. First, apply raw oil to the red area before using the sickle, in order to drain the poison. However, this method must not be used lightly; one should avoid penetrating too deeply. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; teaches that when pricking the skin, the flesh should not be harmed. Each of the nine needles has specific indications. Although the bian-sickle method can treat sores and ulcers, it should still be used with caution.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Method of Poulticing</strong></p>
<p>Swellings and sores that appear on the exterior arise from the accumulation of heat and toxins within. Swellings can present with various characteristics: some may have a head, some are diffuse, some have thick skin, and others have thin skin; some may have deep-seated toxins, while others have superficial ones; some require warm poultices, while others are suited for cool ones; some can have their medicine replaced with dry types, while others are better with moist types. Since the depth varies, so must the choice of medicine, hence it is crucial to distinguish between them. </p>
<p>When a swelling first appears with a seemingly present head, one should apply warm, heat-expelling medicines to draw out the heat and toxins, embodying the principle of dryness through heat. For the surrounding red and inflamed areas, pound fresh cool medicines and apply them as a poultice to subdue the heat, expelling evil, embodying the principle of smothering fire. The potency of cool medicines is strong, their energy intact and their nature robust.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>There may be healers who do not adhere to the principles of nature, but instead resort to universal remedies like herbal ointments. Those with weak powers may cause the weak to confront the strong; isn&#39;t that difficult? There are also inexperienced practitioners who do not understand the nature of disease; they recklessly apply cold medicines, chasing away evil toxins which then enter the body, returning to the heart and liver, resulting in death 80 to 90 percent of the time. Generally, the method of application aims to disperse swelling and toxins, to open the blood vessels and manage the imbalance of cold and heat, thus influencing their departure. If one relies on improper formulas, how can they disperse stagnation and prevent suppuration?</p>
<p>For thick-skinned swellings, use soft cloth or paper with medicine applied and wait for it to dry before changing; for thin-skinned swellings, use loose gauze or thin paper with medicine applied, and it should be changed before the medicine dries. After suppuration occurs, apply warm ointments that promote tissue growth, aiming to expel foul odors, eliminate toxic fluids, remove necrotic tissue, and nurture healthy flesh, entirely relying on the power of warmth in the ointments. Never use cold remedies or apply them with water. Blood vessels prefer warmth and abhor cold; if they are obstructed by cold air, blood stagnation will become difficult to heal.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br><strong>Method of Soaking and Immersion</strong></p>
<p>The method of soaking and immersion for sores and swellings promotes circulation on the surface, disperses evil qi, and facilitates internal resolution of the issue. Indeed, broth has the function of cleansing. The ancients said that if a sore or swelling arises and does not subside within a day or two, one must use broth to soak or spray it. For those located on the limbs, soak them; for those on the waist, abdomen, or back, spray them; and for those in the lower parts, immerse them. This is to open the pores and regulate the blood vessels, preventing stagnation. </p>
<p>For instance, use two taels of medicinal herbs and two liters of water, then boil to obtain one and a half liters. Using clean cloth or new cotton, dip it in the slightly warm medicinal water and soak the affected area, gradually spraying it. If it cools, promptly change it out; be careful not to use it cold. Blood and qi may congeal when exposed to cold and become stagnant without heat. Use this method five to seven times daily; for severe cases, continue day and night, sometimes ten or more times, until the swelling diminishes and pain subsides, thus confirming the effectiveness of this treatment for sores and swellings.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br><strong>Needle Cauterization Method</strong></p>
<p>The diseases of sores and carbuncles have similar signs and symptoms. The method of needle cauterization is certainly not a trivial matter. There are shallow and deep forms, slow and fast responses, appropriate and inappropriate cases; this must be clearly distinguished. Carbuncles have thick skin and small openings, with more pus or fluid that does not drain quickly, thus needle cauterization is advisable. For superficial boils, only a needle should be used to pierce and drain the pus and blood; cauterization is not permitted. If there is no pus formed yet and one waits with various medicines applied to alleviate and soak, and after a long time it does not resolve, and internal suppuration occurs, one should abandon the medication and resort to needle cauterization. One should use a large needle similar to a fire poker, sharpened to a point, and rounded like a jujube pit. It should be heated with flame until it glows red, then dip it in oil to cauterize close to the base of the sore. If the cauterization is not thorough, it must be repeated until it is; the goal is to promote pus drainage without needing to press or squeeze. In recent times, good doctors, in urgent situations, use gold, silver, or iron rods that resemble needles, which can be universally utilized; this effectively releases the toxins. Alternatively, simply burning charcoal fiercely until it glows red, and then using it for cauterization while dipping in oil is particularly effective.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>After cauterization, the actual condition should be treated with twisted hair as a ligature, while for the virtual condition, paper should be used as a ligature. Medicine is dipped on the ligature, and a warm, soft, sticky ointment is applied over it with cloth to keep it moist and prevent it from drying out. When sores and boils have formed, toxic heat gathers and attacks, eroding the epidermis and causing the flesh to rot. If not cauterized, the toxins cannot be resolved, and the pus cannot be discharged. If cauterization is delayed, it will turn inward, leading to internal decay; wishing for recovery in such conditions is futile. Alas! The method of cauterization is indeed the correct approach to treat this ailment. However, it should not be done too early, nor too late. I have seen unskilled practitioners who do not accurately assess the depth of the condition, rashly applying cauterization; either treating deep sores superficially, preventing the discharge of toxins, leading to internal pus; or treating shallow sores too deeply, harming healthy flesh and causing muscle and bone to rot. Sometimes they may irritate the area, causing more pain; or improperly needle in the wrong spot, causing issues elsewhere; or doing it when there is no pus, resulting in prolonged pain. This adds more suffering and damages true vitality. The cause of such outcomes is a failure to encounter a skilled physician. Therefore, it is essential for anyone seeking medical treatment to choose wisely. Even those who recover from frequent treatments are fortunate.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>Moxibustion Therapy</p>
<p>In the case of sores, it is advisable to use moxibustion rather than cauterization; for abscesses, cauterization is preferred over moxibustion. For red tumors and poisonous swellings, it is best to apply moist treatments. If the skin is smooth and soft, it should be pricked with a needle to release the toxins. The methods for treating sores are largely as described, with variations for specific circumstances. Therefore, the &quot;Sacred Remedies&quot; states: for recognizing sores, it is appropriate to apply moxibustion one or two hundred times, about the size of a mung bean. After moxibustion, if you feel a burning pain and it lasts a night, that is the fire energy penetrating deep into the swelling; the heat is directed by the fire and pushed out, hence this sensation. If the sore itches, it is advisable to place a bean curd cake over it for moxibustion. The cake should be made by mixing pepper, ginger, salt, and green onions, mashing them together into a cake with a thickness of about three coins. The moxibustion should be applied on top of the cake placed over the sore. If it feels too hot, lift it up and press it down again. It is better to change the cake frequently for a new one. If the sore is painful, it is crucial to apply moxibustion urgently, using a strong and ample number of treatments. If the pus has already formed, do not use moxibustion; instead, prick it open, and it will heal. For sores that have persisted for a long time and turned into fistulas, it is advisable to use the sulfur moxibustion method.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>The method involves using a piece of sulfur approximately the size of the sore, and separately taking a small amount of sulfur to burn over a fire. Using a needle tip, pick up a little sulfur and apply it three to five times, allowing the pus to dry slightly as a measure. If the back hair starts to grow in, it is advisable to use the cake moxibustion method. Apply moxibustion once you feel the sore on your back, which may be painful and itchy, indicating it is related to back hair.</p>
<p>You can take clean soil mixed with water and knead it into a cake one inch in diameter and two-tenths of an inch thick, placing it directly on the sore, using mugwort to make a stick for moxibustion. Replace the cake after each stick of moxibustion. For sores the size of millet, moxibustion should be done seven times, and for sores the size of a coin, continue the treatment without interruption day and night until healed.</p>
<p>The methods mentioned above, I have personally verified and thus recorded. I believe that physicians practicing wound care from childhood to old age must document their experiences. I recall some physicians who did not verify their treatment involving the larvae; they would take the larvae, cut off both ends, and place them on the sore, applying moxibustion, three times with each replacement, and all were effective. </p>
<p>Also, using the firefly larva for moxibustion has proven effective as noted in previous methods. This knowledge is often kept secret, so much so that it is rarely passed down even between fathers and sons. Another method involves crushing red-skinned garlic, shaping it into a cake similar to a fermented bean cake for moxibustion, which is also very effective.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Internal Dissipation Method</strong></p>
<p>Wounds and sores arise from the imbalance of yin and yang, causing the stagnation of nutrients and defensive Qi, leading to the obstruction of blood and energy flow. The ancients have said: &quot;When yang stagnates in yin, sores develop; when yin stagnates in yang, abscesses form.&quot; Sores and abscesses can originate both internally and externally. Internally, they emerge from the organs and the chest and abdomen, while externally, they appear on the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones, occurring in unpredictable places. The root cause of stagnation stems from the lack of blood and energy flow, whereby steam cannot disperse outward, leading to the accumulation of internal heat, hence the formation of sores and abscesses.</p>
<p>If one first perceives stagnation of Qi and blood, with the skin and flesh hardening and swelling without rupture, it is appropriate to disperse the wind-heat and open the meridians to facilitate internal dissipation. Gradually applying various herbal decoctions will thereby achieve internal resolution. Otherwise, if treatment is delayed, and the toxic heat does not dissipate, it can strike back internally, leading to the accumulation of pus and blood. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that in treating disease, one must seek the root cause. The underlying issue of sores and abscesses is the blockage of internal heat, also prompted by the accumulation of wind and cold. Thus, it is advisable to use warming and heating remedies to harmonize the blood, allowing for internal resolution.</p>
<p>Diagnosis follows certain principles; one must recognize that swelling with hardness and a white color indicates wind and cold, while redness and flair of swelling indicate heat and toxicity, highlighting their differences. If energy has already accumulated, one cannot apply methods for internal dissipation; rather, it is essential to utilize medications that drain pus and resolve inner dampness. These are matters of sequence and priority.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p>
<h3>Method of Pursuing and Eroding</h3>
<p>Wounds and sores arise externally, primarily due to accumulated heat within. The Internal Classic states that when the blood is heated and the flesh decays, the protective and nourishing processes are impeded, leading to pus formation and decay. When a sore festers and begins to rot, yet the head is small and unbroken and the wound has not opened, or if toxic gases are not released and the pain is unbearable, we must establish the method of pursuing and eroding pus to allow toxins to escape instead of attacking internally, facilitating the removal of bad flesh and the growth of healthy tissue.</p>
<p>If the sore is constricted and the blood flows without stopping, one should not attempt to constrict it. Instead, apply the pursuing and eroding medicine to the sore and wait until it is ripe before attempting to close it. If the pain of the constricted sore affects the heart and root, one should also refrain from forcing it closed, for touching the sore will certainly exacerbate the pain, potentially leading to complications; caution is imperative.</p>
<p>If the pus and blood have formed but the sore has not yet broken, and a thin layer of skin has lifted, one should immediately use a breaking agent to secure it on top, applying ointment. After the pus emerges, use a medicine to extract pus and transform toxins; the effect will be remarkable. If the pus and blood have not been exhausted, using a medicine to promote flesh growth and contract the wound in hopes of quick healing is ill-advised; failing to eliminate bad tissue will lead to the wound closing prematurely but possibly recurring later, so one must exercise caution. </p>
<h3>Method of Placing and Securing<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></h3>
<p>Wounds, ulcers, boils, tumors, abscesses, and swellings, when first perceived, should be treated with methods to resolve them internally. If they persist for a long time and the vital energy and blood weaken, leading to cold muscles and flesh, with clear, thin pus, toxins remain inside, the wound edges do not close, and a lump forms that is not red, or a tuberculosis-like condition without pus, and the external symptoms are unclear, one should apply the method of &quot;tuo li&quot; (removing interior toxins). If pus has not yet formed, measures should be taken to hasten its formation. If pus has already suppurated, efforts should be made to promote the growth of new flesh. In cases of deficiency of blood and energy, &quot;tuo li&quot; should be used to replenish them. If Yin and Yang are in disharmony, &quot;tuo li&quot; should be used to harmonize them. Generally, the method of &quot;tuo li&quot; should ensure that wounds do not develop further complications. For any practitioner of wound treatment, it is essential to have &quot;tuo li&quot; medicine available every day. Nevertheless, one must carefully assess the urgency of cold, heat, warmth, or coolness, as well as symptoms like thirst, disturbance, nausea, and treat accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Relief Methods</strong></p>
<p>Conditions of wounds and ulcers vary; both cold and heat, deficiency and excess, can produce pain. Therefore, methods to alleviate pain are not limited to one approach. People often believe substances like milk and myrrh are precious remedies to relieve pain, unaware that different conditions require specific methods. Pain due to heat can be alleviated by using cold remedies to counteract the heat, thereby stopping the pain. Pain from cold pathogens can be alleviated by applying warm remedies to dispel the cold, thus relieving the pain. If pain is caused by wind, the wind should be dispelled; if from dampness, the dampness should be guided away. If pain arises from dryness, moisture should be added; if from obstruction, it should be unblocked; if from deficiency, it should be supplemented; if from excess, it should be purged. If pain is caused by trapped pus, it should be released; if unhealthy flesh is festering, it should be drawn out; if there’s disharmony between Yin and Yang, it should be balanced; if there are secret conditions in the meridians, they should be unblocked. Being able to adapt to circumstances is the mark of a superior physician; one must not cling to fixed methods without considering the context.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>On the Method of Adjusting Medicinal Dosage</strong></p>
<p>Ancient people used medicine according to the illness, tailoring treatments without rigid adherence to formulas, adjusting dosages based on the condition. For treating accumulations and providing nourishment, one could use pill form based on old formulas without modification. In critical situations with sores and abscesses, where symptoms are diverse, how could one adhere strictly to formulas? Indeed, adjustments can be made according to necessity. </p>
<p>For example, in cases of furuncular abscesses accompanied by headache due to deficiency before and after suppuration, add Schisandra to the medicine applied. If the patient is restless and disoriented, add ginseng and Poria. For deficiency with fever, include Rehmannia and the root of (wild) yam. In cases of alternating chills and heat, add Bupleurum and the bark of Lycium. If thirst persists, add Anemarrhena and red bean. For constipation, add rhubarb and Glauber&#39;s salt. For urinary retention, add muk and hemp grass. If marked fatigue occurs, add goji berries and asparagus. For diarrhea, add magnolia bark. If extremities are cold, include aconite and ginger. For nausea, add clove and patchouli. If there is excessive phlegm, add pinellia and aged tangerine peel. For abundant pus, add angelica and ligusticum. If pain is severe, add myrrh and frankincense. For delayed muscle growth, add white atractylodes and cinnamon. If there is wind evil, add ligusticum and saposhnikovia. For palpitations and anxiety, add cinnabar. If there is twitching of the mouth and eyes, add notopterygium and asarum. </p>
<p>Though humble and unskilled, throughout my life, I have consistently followed this method of adjusting dosages for treating sores and abscesses, achieving remarkable results. Future scholars should study this in detail.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>Adaptation of Methods in Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The diseases of sores and boils require various treatment methods. In general, each has its suitability. There are tonics and purgatives, methods for washing and applying poultices, and techniques involving needles, knives, moxibustion, and cauterization, all of which differ in use. Those who understand the principles will definitely achieve effective treatments. Yet those who are ignorant of these principles may encounter disadvantages. I have seen instances of treating cold with heat, and heat with cold, which are common misunderstandings throughout history. Additionally, some inspect prescriptions and treat illnesses by arbitrarily adding or subtracting ingredients based on personal judgment, believing it to be right. However, they do not recognize that diseases can manifest in counterproductive ways, treatments may need to be careful or urgent, methods have their rightful authority, and prescriptions have their odd or even variations, with applications varying in intensity and weight. </p>
<p>Doctors must comprehend these principles; only with understanding can they adapt methods accordingly. Those who grasp the nuances can realize the principles and acknowledge the rationale behind them, thereby accessing the source of knowledge. While I may be less skilled, I will share a fragment of understanding. I have seen that treating cold with heat may result in worsening cold, and treating heat with cold may escalate the heat. Why is this so? It stems from an ignorance of the yin and yang qualities of the five organs, where one should treat like with like. For example, if the heart&#39;s heat is excessive, one should nourish the kidneys; the kidney&#39;s water will sufficiently replenish it, causing the heat to diminish. Conversely, if the kidneys are deficient and cold, one should supplement the heart&#39;s fire; once the heart fire increases, the cold will diminish. This is what is meant by treating cold with yin and treating heat with yang. </p>
<p>Moreover, using heat to treat cold and using cold to treat heat should ultimately align with the principles of yin and yang. I&#39;ve also heard that when treatments for minor issues go against the condition, more severe treatments may be in order. What does this mean? Treating cold with heat must proceed coolly, while treating heat with cold must be done gently. This aims for a harmonious balance.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>Among these, there are both &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot; approaches—why is that? It is because illnesses can be mild or severe. For mild cases, one should apply counter-treatment, which aligns with the correct principle; for severe cases, one follows treatment that aligns with alternative principles. However, in the treatment of sores, regarding supplementary and purging methods, it is essential to understand the foundational principles of these correct and alternative approaches—how can one neglect this knowledge?</p>
<p>Generally, the critical method for treating sores and abscesses starts with recognizing the presence of heat and toxins, where fever and stagnation lead to the development of sores and abscesses. Within the first couple of days, one should first take the Five Benefits Decoction to eliminate evil qi, clear the internal organs, and facilitate internal resolution. </p>
<p>As for decoction methods from ancient to modern times, they suggest cutting the herbs into pieces the size of a soybean and rapidly boiling them over high heat, ensuring they do not become overcooked, as the aim is for fast effectiveness. Then, one employs pills and powders to guide the blood vessels, gradually dissolving the issues to promote a more gentle dispersal. </p>
<p>Additionally, one should use moistening and warming methods, while also employing medicated plasters and pastes to apply around the sores, in accordance with the principles of yin and yang.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>In treating ailments, one must adjust methods according to the situation, considering the specifics of each case. Factors such as severity and urgency vary and should be addressed accordingly. The status of individuals, whether male or female, rich or poor, should also be taken into account. As the Jin official Shu Cheng stated: widows and nuns differ from wives and concubines; although they do not have the burdens of a household, they bear the pain of worries—this reflects a deep understanding of their circumstances. Moreover, Zhang Zhongjing stated: the nature of substances is both rigid and flexible, and therefore, different settings also call for different treatments. This is why the Yellow Emperor raised questions from all directions, and Qibo outlined various healing methods. How could one rigidly adhere to formulas without considering adaptability when seeking to cure diseases? There are also cases of sores, swellings, and pains that emerge suddenly, where within one or two days, one might feel a deep, thin pulse and discomfort, with internal organs being weak and the skin feeling cold, while external symptoms appear deep and subdued. In such cases, it would be appropriate to use the Tuoli Powder immediately, or adjust the Fuling Decoction, along with warm and hot remedies for treatment.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p>
<h3>On the Five Types of Boils</h3>
<p>The five types refer to boils and sores that arise on the head, back, eyebrows, beard, and temples. Generally speaking, they can be divided into three categories: the sore, the boil, and the pustule. </p>
<p>When a sore first appears, it is the size of a grain of millet, with distinct itching and pain. If one accidentally breaks it, it will spread and expand, becoming red and swollen, causing a deep, heavy sensation that pulls and pains the ribs. After several days, the skin becomes hot and thick, accompanied by chills and thirst. The swelling expands, and after several days without healing, it may lead to bleeding if suppressed. Those that arise on the back are called back sores. Those that arise on the head are known as cerebral sores. Those that appear on the temples and eyebrows are named accordingly. </p>
<p>There are also instances where a sore develops without a head, wide-ranging three to four inches, initially causing a feeling of pressure and pain. After a few days, the skin appears smooth and soft, and in severe cases, it can also induce fever, chills, headache, and thirst, which is termed a back boil. Moreover, if a sore appears with a head, red and floating without a root, measuring one to two inches between the skin, it is considered a pustule.</p>
<p>Among these three types, the sore is the most severe. All these ailments arise from indulgence in rich foods and excessive clothing. Thick clothing keeps one warm but makes it easy for cold to invade, while overindulgence in food generates heat within the five organs. Accumulated heat in the internal organs obstructs the flow of blood vessels, causing toxic substances to stagnate, with evil pathogens remaining in the body. Heat acts on the blood, leading to its clumping, and eventually causing the flesh to break down into sores—shallower ones become pustules, deeper ones become boils, and the deepest turn into sores.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>There are those who have developed this ailment after taking gold or stone medicines, and there are also those who have never taken such medicines yet suffer from the same disease. This is likely due to their ancestors having ingested such substances, causing toxic factors to be passed down to their descendants. When this illness first manifests as a sore, it should be treated promptly. For individuals with strong vital energy, they should urgently take Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction or Loulu Decoction. For those under fifty years old who are robust and strong, they may take the Five-Li Dahuang Decoction or Detox Pills to promote the smooth functioning of the internal organs. On the sore itself, apply poison-coursing powders and warm, heated plasters. Additionally, use dispelling swelling decoction and purging toxin decoction to cleanse, and thus prepare for the maturation of pus. Initially, other medicines should not be used to treat, so as to soothe the patient&#39;s mind; one must be careful not to cause irritation. </p>
<p>Once the pus has formed and bursts, it is advisable to take the Five-Spice Decoction, as well as internal Litoran Powder, Polygala Decoction, or other similar formulas. For unquenchable thirst, one should use Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction or Frankincense Powder. Avoid taking strong purgatives like Dahuang or bitter cold medicines; if one takes excessive purgatives resulting in uncontrollable diarrhea, it could be fatal. If there are still necrotic tissues in the sore and the pus is not flowing freely, one should use cauterizing medicines or apply a mixture with deer antler powder to form a paste with vinegar. When the necrotic tissue recedes and healthy tissue begins to form, use pus-expelling powder or similar formulas. If the toxic energy within the sore has not yet dissipated, be cautious not to close it up too soon. If one were to use medicines to promote flesh regrowth too early, even if recovery occurs, there will likely be a recurrence. Adjustments and care should be tailored to the situation, while also being mindful of protective and cautionary measures.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The affliction of sores and swellings is most severe in the case of boils and carbuncles. However, how can we distinguish between them? The Classic states that when the nourishing and protective energies are obstructed within the meridians, they do not flow freely. When the blood vessels do not move, the yang energy becomes stagnant and does not circulate, resulting in the emergence of cold, heat, and toxic miasmas, which then manifest externally and accumulate to form boils. If these do not dissipate over time, the heat will invade, leading to necrosis and pus formation. Nevertheless, if the bone marrow is not scorched and the organs are not damaged, they can be treated and healed.</p>
<p>What, then, is a carbuncle? It occurs when the five organs are afflicted with wind, poison, and accumulated heat. The toxic heat descends and penetrates the skin, causing the bone marrow to dry up and the blood vitality to deplete, resulting in swelling that appears dark and hard like the skin of an ox’s neck, hence the name carbuncle. Boils, on the other hand, have a thinner, moister outer skin; this is their characteristic.</p>
<p>The emergence of boils and carbuncles can originate from both internal and external factors. Internally, they may arise in the organs of the chest and abdomen; externally, they manifest on the surface of the skin, muscles, and bones. These two types of toxins can appear anywhere and are defined by consistent names. The root of stagnation begins with the mismanagement of emotions like joy, anger, worry, and pleasure, as well as irregularities in diet and living conditions. It may also result from the activation of minerals, stones, or herbs, along with imbalances of cold, heat, dryness, and moisture, which lead to an internal disharmony of yin and yang and subsequently to an external stagnation of the nourishing and protective energies, causing decay.</p>
<p>In mild cases, the affliction starts in the six fu organs, rising to form a boil, as the energy flows superficially; in severe cases, it originates from the five zang organs, sinking to form a carbuncle, as the energy flows deeper. Understanding these two conditions allows for the extrapolation to other types of swellings, toxins, and rashes.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br><strong>Boil and Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>Boils and carbuncles are named because their shape resembles that of a lid. According to ancient texts, there are generally ten kinds. Huayan describes five-colored boils, and the &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; mentions thirteen types of boils. This aligns with the &quot;Secret Essentials of External Treatments,&quot; which thoroughly discusses the subject. However, all these descriptions pertain to the accumulation of pathogenic qi in the meridians and internal organs, resulting in hidden toxic heat. Initially, there is swelling and pain, with colors varying between blue, yellow, red, and black, leading to agitation and discomfort. Symptoms may include aversion to cold, headache, or nausea. If the boil is pricked with a needle but yields no pain or blood, this is a relevant sign. </p>
<p>This condition is primarily due to excessive rich and fatty foods and careless indulgence with alcohol, resulting in an accumulation of harmful toxins that leads to the formation of boils. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the change from rich foods gives rise to significant boils. The treatment method is to hastily apply moxibustion with mugwort sticks. If the boil does not hurt when pricked and does not produce blood, heat the needle until it is red and cauterize the boil, turning it to char; pain is considered a desired effect. Additionally, treat the previous location with ointment, and take herbal decoctions like Wuxiang Lianqiao soup or Loulu soup to promote a thorough resolution. </p>
<p>If there is no pain when pricked, and if the person experiences darkening vision or sees lights, do not treat them. This indicates that toxic qi has entered the internal organs. The &quot;Health Preservation Prescriptions&quot; states: if a person sweats into their flesh and then consumes it, they may develop boils. Caution is advised.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Abscess, Carbuncles, and Toxic Conditions</strong></p>
<p>To disperse various toxins, grind white hibiscus leaves and mix them with a small amount of Aconitum leaves and honey for application. For severe cases, add powdered southern star. For any toxic conditions that cause thirst, or excessive pus, prevent further thirst; it is advisable to use the Qianjin Neibu San alongside Bawei Wan, with the five-flavor ones being preferable. In cases of fever and chills resembling typhoid but with pain, the painful spots may become abscesses. An abscess is related to the intestines and grows superficially, with thin skin and swelling; a carbuncle is related to the organs, hence it grows deep, with thick skin and hard swelling. A milder condition than these is called a boil. An abscess indicates stagnation, a carbuncle indicates blockage, and a boil represents a nodular condition, suggesting stagnation of qi and blood. One may also use Wei Ling Xian Yin for slight benefits, or Wu Xiang Lian Qiao San, supplemented by Fu Yuan Tong Qi San. If pus and blood coalesce and do not disperse, whether already ruptured or not, it is advisable to use Xiao Tuo Li San, or Qianjin Neibu San, with the addition of equal parts Mu Xiang, Qiang Huo, Bai Shao Yao, and Wu Yao; for thirst, add the root of (艹舌) Lou. All these medicines treat Yang conditions.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>For conditions characterized by excess yin, it is advisable to use a remedy from the &quot;Thousand Golds&quot; that supplements and disperses, reducing half of the quantities of Fangfeng and Jie geng, while doubling the amount of Baizhu. If there is no effect, add more Shufu and cook with other herbs for better results. </p>
<p>If external remedies such as gold and stone are used to assist with desires, and the essential energy has already waned, the toxic effects may overpower; since gold and stone are similar to the lungs, which are connected to the kidneys, it often leads to the disease of developing back issues. There is also the use of tortoise for external application, which also treats back problems; the yang energy of the tortoise is concentrated in its upper shell, so the upper shell can be used as medicine. The treatment method remains the same. If toxicity arises in the yin, yet it is not suitable to use medications like Fu or Gui, and there is exterior pain with internal cold, it is advisable to use a Wuxiang Decoction. </p>
<p>At the early stages of toxin emergence, it is recommended to use wine to adjust and restore the flow of qi. If the illness is located in the lower parts, apply a wine paste pill to restore qi and swallow it down with a Muxiang Decoction. </p>
<p>For treating various formed toxins, a paste made from the fruits of the soapberry tree, ground with black vinegar and applied topically is beneficial. These fruits should be stored in a smoke-proof box for convenient usage in times of need. </p>
<p>For those suffering from back sores, or if various toxins have already erupted and there is excessive blood loss and insufficient body fluids, it is necessary to change the skin and dispel toxins. At the onset of headaches, body aches, alternating chills and fever, fearing the influence of external evils, using Xiangsu Decoction with added Chuanxiong, Baizhi, Fangfeng, Danggui, and Chenpi is advisable.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>Those who suffer from diabetes often develop toxic conditions, as their fluids have been depleted, causing a deficiency of yang both internally and externally, leading to severe illness. Generally, when diabetes leads to toxicity after recovery, and the toxicity returns to cause diabetes, these are considered untreatable conditions.</p>
<p>Boils and carbuncles are general terms for various toxic manifestations, each with different symptoms and names. Before they rupture, there may be chills, intense heat, delirium, and visions as if encountering ghosts or spirits. If there is significant pus discharge along with persistent high fever, it is likely difficult to treat. The presence of pus due to toxicity parallels the sweating seen in cold illnesses; if sweating occurs followed by a resurgence of high fever, it indicates a severe cold injury. For external treatment, washing and applying dressings are appropriate. If a boil or carbuncle on the back has ruptured with excessive pus and signs of emaciation, the formula for Xiong Gui Tang should be used. In all medications administered, white atractylodes must be avoided, as it can promote pus formation. However, it can be used for unruptured or initial cases.</p>
<p>If the person experiences vomiting and has little appetite, the Qianjin Neibu San should not be used, as it can stagnate the spleen and may carry external pathogens. For unruptured conditions, Er Chen Tang with added Xiong can be applied, or Jin Zhengqi San may be used without alteration. For those with ruptured conditions, Gu Shen Jia He Drink is suitable.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>In another method, when addressing poison and lack of appetite, one uses the Zheng Qi San, adding Bai Fu Ling and Ban Xia in equal parts, and reducing Ren Shen and Mu Xiang by half; this too is called Zheng Qi San. In cases of purulent boils where the blood has already suppurated excessively, leading to depletion of fluids and severe thirst, along with symptoms of fever and agitation, one cannot treat with ordinary measures, but should use tonics that nourish and generate fluids. If there is severe and unceasing heat, treatment becomes difficult. For chronic sores that do not dry up and leak, regularly consuming honeysuckle grass soaked in wine is advised. If sores are present and the stool is hard, one can use Sheng Ma He Qi Yin or Xiao Du Yin; if there is considerable body heat, combine Xiao Du Yin with Bai Du San. </p>
<p>If there is a fire pathogen invading the body, or if one develops red nodules all over the body after moxibustion, accompanied by swelling and painful bumps, one should wash with Jing Fang Tang infused. The condition known as &quot;yang husk&quot; involves the use of fresh Shi Chang Pu mashed and prepared; then, with about an ounce of Shi Shou Jiao, calcined to preserve its properties, grind it into powder and take it with wine. </p>
<p>In cases where there is severe pain without applying medicine, the pain alleviates once the medicine is applied; conversely, when there is no pain without medicine, applying it causes pain. This results from the accumulation of cold, heat, wind, dampness, and emotions like worry and anger, which attack internally, causing unremitting pain. When the medicine is dispelled from the body, the pain does not occur; however, when the hidden blood and yin toxins are deep within, the more one takes the medicine, the deeper it goes, and one feels less pain. Conversely, when the medicine affects the exterior, it can cause pain again.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case Studies of the Xue Family</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Xue Ji]</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Medicinal Use</strong></p>
<p>Illnesses in individuals vary, and medicinal properties also differ. There are appropriate medicines for each condition that must not be misapplied. For instance, in cases of sores or abscesses where pain subsides, appetite returns, and both pulse and symptoms are gentle, the focus should be on the root cause; therefore, using gentle and harmonious medicines allows for gradual treatment and generally leads to healing. However, if the pulse is deep and tight, accompanied by swelling, chills, fever, and restlessness, this indicates a solid pulse condition that requires purging. Only strong purgatives can resolve such conditions, while using gentle remedies here would be inappropriate. Conversely, if sores are swollen but not yet suppurating, or if there is a clear, watery discharge, or if there are severe diarrhea and an inability to eat, with potential vomiting at any time or coldness in the hands and feet, this reflects a weak pulse condition that cannot be balanced without significant tonics. Here, employing aggressive purging medications would also be inappropriate.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>When addressing the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; consider that what is deficient should be supplemented, what is excessive should be drained, what is hot should be cleared, and what is cold should be warmed. Follow the principles of diagnosis and adapt treatments accordingly to avoid errors. Generally, the signs of sores and ulcers arise from disharmony in the organs, stagnation of qi and blood, irregular emotions, unregulated diet, or improper skin and muscle defenses, allowing pathogenic influences to invade the meridians. Additionally, the use of mineral medications, indulgence in rich foods, and neglecting intimate life can lead to deficiency of essence and depletion of qi. Therefore, when treating the symptoms, one must discern the internal and external conditions of deficiency and excess, and treat accordingly. If one does not consider the principles of yin and yang, the dynamics of qi and substance, and hastily prescribes medicines, it may lead to a confusion of treatments for deficiency and excess. Furthermore, adhering rigidly to the “royal way” of treatment without adapting can be harmful. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the formation of sores and carbuncles, regardless of their deficiency or excess, cold or heat, arises from stagnation of qi. It also mentions that when qi is trapped in the meridians, it becomes thick with blood and stagnates, resulting from emotional disturbances like joy, anger, worry, and thought. Additionally, if the body has heat and is struck by wind-cold, the stagnation of blood and vessels can lead to blockage and heat accumulation, among other factors.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>There is an imbalance of Yin deficiency and Yang energy, causing cold to transform into heat. When heat accumulates, meat decays into pus; this is due to injury from cold, heat, wind, and heat. Some cases arise from applying heated substances excessively on damp bedding, while others result from overexertion in sexual activities that deplete essential energy. &quot;Erya&quot; states: a boil is a festering sore, a carbuncle is a blockage, and an ulcer is an obstruction. This means that the disharmony of Yin and Yang leads to stagnation and eventually results in carbuncles and ulcers. Furthermore, it states that when Yin stagnates in Yang, boils occur; when Yang stagnates in Yin, ulcers arise. These two types of toxins do not have a fixed location and should be discerned through pulse diagnosis. A floating, rapid pulse indicates Yang, while a weak, sinking pulse indicates Yin. Heat should be treated with cooling methods, and cold should be treated with warming methods. There are four stages and eight considerations in treatment. Initially, one should reduce heat and eliminate toxins; once an abscess has formed, one should drain pus and alleviate pain. If pus is present, necrotic tissue should be removed, and once it is completely excised, a scab can be allowed to form. After understanding the stages, one must also identify the causes for targeted treatment, observing the severity and prognosis of the illness.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>When it is cold, warm it; when it is hot, cool it; when there is deficiency, tonify it; when there is excess, drain it. Use needles to guide, moxibustion to burn; break toxins and resolve firm masses, aiming for balance. </p>
<p>A guest asked about the pulse being rapid and forceful in cases of sores, along with a feeling of heat in the body, which indicates a yang condition, and whether there could also be death in such cases. The response was: The classics say that if yin stagnates in yang, it leads to carbuncles, with the pulse appearing deep, thin, weak, and slippery; if yang stagnates in yin, it leads to ulcers, with the pulse appearing superficial, rapid, and string-like. This pertains to the differentiation of conditions based on qi and blood, classifying sores and ulcers as belonging to either yin or yang. </p>
<p>Although such sores and ulcers may arise from accumulated heat, if they are newly formed and not yet discharging pus, a rapid and forceful pulse indicates a deficiency in yin and an excess in yang. If pus forms internally and cannot be released externally, the body will definitely show a rise in temperature; thus, the rapid and forceful pulse indicates a progression of the condition regarding sores and ulcers. Once the pus is discharged, the pulse should become calm, the body cool, the swelling should diminish, and the pain should cease, similar to a recovery from the exterior manifestations of cold damage upon sweating. If, however, there is a return of fever with thirst and a rapid and forceful pulse, this indicates a true qi deficiency with an excess of pathogenic qi, leading to certain death without doubt.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>Three Essential Principles of Treatment</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Disease Mechanism&quot; states that ulcers belong to the fire category, and treatment must differentiate between internal and external factors to address the root cause. If the pulse is deep and firm, one must first clear the internal influences to cut off the source. If the pulse is floating and large, one must first support the internal organs to prevent evildoers from entering. When there are influences from both internal and external sources, if the evil qi becomes excessive, it obstructs the meridians, leading to bumps and swellings. This results from failures in supporting the internal organs, achieving smooth communication, and harmonizing the defensive and nutritive qi. </p>
<p>The key to treating ulcers must clarify the three methods of supporting the internal organs, ensuring smooth communication, and harmonizing the defensive and nutritive qi. For issues that are external in nature, if the pulse is deep and firm, with fever and irritability, lacking external redness, and pain felt deeply within, the evil qi is severe; one should clear the internal organs to cut off the source. For problems that are internal but display externally, if the pulse is floating and rapid, with swelling on the surface, and the symptoms are obvious, there is a concern that the evil qi is extreme and may penetrate inward, thus one must first support the internal organs. In cases that are mixed, where there are no evil qi symptoms on the surface and the internal organs are functioning smoothly, it can be recognized that the balance in the meridians must be harmonized with the defensive and nutritive qi.</p>
<p>After applying these three methods, even if the situation isn&#39;t perfect, there should be no significant changes in symptoms. This approach can significantly reduce the evil qi and facilitate recovery.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p>
<h3>Moxibustion Method</h3>
<p>The &quot;Yuan Rong&quot; states: Sores and ulcers that enter from the outside should not be moxibustioned, while those that arise from the inside should be moxibustioned. External entry should be removed without entering inside, while internal emergence should be connected to allow for outward passage. Therefore, the classics say: &quot;For those that are sunken, moxibustion is needed.&quot; If there is no pain during moxibustion, one should stop only after the pain begins. The reason there is no pain during moxibustion is because one first treats the area that is not yet ruptured, causing a lack of sensation, and then addresses the healthy flesh, which causes discomfort.</p>
<p>If there is pain during moxibustion, one should stop only after the pain subsides. The pain indicates the treatment is applied to the area that has not yet ruptured, while the subsequent area that is about to rupture does not cause pain. However, this is merely a general guideline; along with the methods from &quot;East Wall&quot; and others, it is advisable to reference them. When a person first feels the back swelling, which is red, hot, and painful, one should first cover the area with a wet paper and watch. The part of the paper that dries first indicates where the abscess is forming. </p>
<p>Take garlic sliced to thickness of two to three qian, place it on top of the swelling, and moxibustion with a large moxa stick for three rounds. Then replace with another slice of garlic, moxibustion until the pain ceases or, if there is no pain, until pain emerges, at which point one should stop. The key is to recognize the condition early and start moxibustion right away. </p>
<p>If treated within one or two days, it remains highly effective; within three or four days, it is moderately effective; within five or six days, it is less effective; but after seven days, moxibustion should not be performed. If there are ten or more locations forming abscesses at the same spot, mash garlic into a paste, spread it into a thin pancake and place it on the area, burning moxa on top of the garlic pancake can also be effective.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>If a sore initially appears on the back, with a red and swollen area and a small lump in the middle resembling a grain of millet, take a whole garlic bulb, cut off both ends, and use a piece about half an inch thick, placing it directly on the sore, then apply moxa treatment fourteen times, increasing to a maximum of forty-nine times. </p>
<p>(Note: It is said that for the emergence of furuncles and abscesses, moxibustion is advisable. However, for sores that have long been festering and continuously produce non-foul pus without any rotten flesh, it is particularly beneficial to use aconite, thoroughly soaked, cut into pieces about three to two-tenths of an inch thick, and applied to the sore, followed by moxibustion. Also, take internal medicines, and perform moxibustion again every three to two days, until five to seven times have been done, at which point the muscle will naturally regenerate.</p>
<p>For those with deep-rooted pus and foul substances gradually breaking down, the method by Guo involves using white flour, sulfur, and garlic, all mashed together. Depending on the size of the sore, make into cakes about three-tenths of an inch thick, applying them to the sore with moxa burning twenty-one times, changing the application each time. After four to five days, one may then use the Qingxia and Xinyao products interchangeably, inserting into the sore until all rotten flesh is expelled and healthy tissue begins to grow evenly. Then apply a consolidating medicine and take appropriate internal remedies; once the body is regulated, it will heal. </p>
<p>It is important to note that moxibustion should not only be applied at the initial emergence of the sore. Generally, during the initial stage, it is beneficial to use moxibustion and supportive medicines to promote sweating and nourishment. For treating cold sores, appropriate internal medicines must also be used. If there is any adverse reaction, not only will it not heal, but it may lead to the development of other illnesses.)<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p>
<h3>Method of Attack and Supplement</h3>
<p>The &quot;Yuan Rong&quot; states: When the pulse is trapped, it signifies a fistula, where flesh is entangled, leading to the blockage of vital energy, which then turns backwards against the flesh&#39;s structure and results in abscesses and swellings. If the nourishing energy is stagnant and the blood is prolonged, heat gathers into pus. The &quot;Zheng Li Lun&quot; states: Where heat flows, there are abscesses and swellings. Is it possible for nourishing energy to not follow, yet still not be hot? The answer is: The transformation of rich foods, the beauty of fragrant herbs, the excess of metals and stones, causes the energy and blood to not flourish, while the protective and nourishing energies become full but are restrained and unable to move, thereby blocking the blood and energy which then decays and turns into an abscess; it should be dispelled to remove the accumulated heat. If a person has a sparse diet, weak spirit, deficient energy and blood, with thin and emaciated muscles, the protective and nourishing energies short and stagnant, resulting in cold and thin structures that are closed and obstructed leading to abscesses and swellings; thus, they should be supplemented to connect with the weak and cowardly energy. The distinctions in the pulse, whether floating or sinking, should also be recognized. Once the excess and deficiency are understood, dispelling can be achieved using substances like Forsythia and Rhubarb, while supplementation can be approached with internal tonics. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The differentiation of sores caused by heat or cold, and the blockage caused by stagnant energy and blood, necessitates different methods of attack and supplementation, which should be compared with previous and subsequent texts for a comprehensive understanding. However, the common understanding in society often misses this principle, claiming certain conditions are sores while incorrectly administering Five Spice Forsythia Decoction. This leads to mixed outcomes due to a lack of discernment in the deficiency or excess of form and energy, as well as the depth of sores and toxins, and the differing causes of treatments for external vs. internal issues. Therefore, regarding the teachings of Master Danxi in &quot;Essentials of External Medicine,&quot; the principles outlined should be appended for the learners&#39; reference.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br><strong>On the Three Causes</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze states: Those who develop abscesses are affected by three causes. It is stated: Abscesses, boils, and scrofula arise from stagnation of qi, regardless of whether they are caused by deficiency or excess, cold or heat. The classics also say: Qi, stagnating in the meridians and congealing with blood, fails to circulate and leads to abscess formation. It does not specify that heat must be present for an abscess to form; this arises from internal factors such as pent-up emotions of joy, anger, worry, or thought. When the body has heat and is struck by wind and cold, the blood vessels become stagnant and fail to circulate, leading to the blockage of heat gases that results in abscesses. Additionally, when a deficiency of yin allows yang qi to attack, or cold transforms into heat, excessive heat can cause flesh to decay and turn into pus. This too is an external cause caused by cold, heat, wind, and dampness. Furthermore, cases resulting from the intake of dan stone and consuming roasted wine, as well as excessive efforts in intimate activities leading to depletion of essence and qi, arise from internal and external injuries, thus indicating the presence of all three causes. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the division of the three causes is comprehensive, if the pathogens of sores and abscesses are not present, and if there are distinctions in the different layers (surface and interior), then the treatment cannot be exhaustively detailed.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>When yin stagnates in yang, it creates carbuncles; when yang stagnates in yin, it creates sores. </p>
<p>Danxi said: &quot;The Essentials state that when yang is stagnant in yin, the pulse is floating, surging, and rapid; when yin is stagnant in yang, the pulse is deep, thin, weak, and hesitant. Yang stagnation is treated with cold, while yin stagnation is treated with heat. To understand this more deeply, the stagnation of yang in yin should be treated with heat, and the stagnation of yin in yang should be treated with cold. </p>
<p>When searching through cold and heat, it can indeed be analyzed as a theory of yin and yang; regarding yin and yang, it is distinctly related to qi and blood, with nothing more to be said. If heat stagnates in qi, can there be no cold stagnation? If cold stagnates in blood, can there be no heat stagnation? Why can cold not harm qi, and heat not harm blood? </p>
<p>From my observation, qi is yang, operating in the exterior of the pulse; blood is yin, moving in the interior of the pulse. Together, they circulate and flow without interruption, creating what we call the pulse. With each exhalation, the pulse moves three inches, and with each inhalation, it also moves three inches. The rhythm of breathing continuously amounts to six inches, circulating throughout the entire body, which is 81 zhang (a unit of length). When heat is present, movement is quick and excessive; when cold is present, movement is slow and inadequate.&quot;<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>The richness of flavors, the skewness of emotions, the stagnation of qi leads to thick fluids that accumulate over time, becoming either drink or phlegm, seeping into the meridians, causing chaos in the blood, resulting in turbidity, and then either causing boiling or coldness. This is the stagnation of yin in yang, and the proper blood stagnating in qi. Regarding qi-related illnesses, people today may assist the pathogenic influence with medication, leading to the emergence of new diseases, causing blood-related issues to increase daily, overflowing outside the meridians, obstructing pathways, hindering ascension and descent, and disrupting normal transformation—a case of yang stagnating in yin, and proper qi stagnating in blood. When distinguishing between cold and heat diseases, it is essential to consider the inherent predispositions and the mixtures of deficiencies and pathogenic factors. Can we simply equate yin with cold and yang with heat? The floating, rapid, and wiry pulse indicates qi-related illness. Should we hastily label this as a heat condition? The deep, thin, and weak pulse points to blood-related illness. Should we then hastily label this as a cold condition? This is the root of countless diseases; it is not limited to just scabies, sores, carbuncles, or abscesses. It is important to evaluate their correctness.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br><strong>The Principles of Vital Energy</strong></p>
<p>Dongyuan states: The theory of vital energy communicating with heaven indicates that when the nourishing energy is obstructed, it goes against the principles of the flesh, leading to the formation of boils and swellings. It also mentions that a diet rich in fatty and fine foods can cause serious sores and ailments like a false void. The theory of yin and yang influence states that the moist conditions of the earth negatively affect a person&#39;s skin, flesh, and muscles. This means that external dampness causes the nourishing energy to stagnate, and both the protective and nourishing energies are governed by this vital energy. The nourishing energy is derived from the stomach and is essential for circulation. When this energy is obstructed and adversely affected by dampness, it results in sores and ulcerations. The issue of excessive richness and flavor in food refers to how it causes the nourishing energy to flow in reverse, accumulating in the meridians and leading to sores and ulcers. This pathogenic factor is neither external nor internal, but exists primarily as a disease within the meridians. The aforementioned statements from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; highlight that conditions arise from the obstruction of vital energy. A comprehensive examination of various discussions on sores and ulcers reveals many references to the interplay of two types of heat, the transformation of heat into pus, as well as instances where heat transforms into pus due to moisture, or cold transforms into heat resulting in pus; these all represent the root causes of sores and carbuncles.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>In the observed parts, it is appropriate to use medicinal references, and also consider the division of yin and yang in the diagnosis. First, drain the nutritive qi, as this is foundational. When the vital energy is reversed, it assists the fire; when dampness and heat combine, they damage the muscles and lead to pus and blood, which is secondary treatment. It is necessary to obtain various items for comparison. During the year, the extreme heat does not exceed summer; at that time, all things do not rot, but spoil when autumn dampness greatly prevails. </p>
<p>Taking close observations of the body, when the hot disease manifests, it shows evident heat without damaging the muscles, which makes this principle clear. Without identifying the root and symptoms, evil qi cannot be eliminated. To understand one thing and know a hundred indicates a skilled practitioner. </p>
<p>When the nutritive qi does not flow and reverses in the muscle structure, ulcers and abscesses arise. The nutritive qi is related to stomach qi. When food enters the stomach, it is first transported to the spleen and then directed to the lungs. The lungs connect to all the meridians, subsequently affecting the skin and hair, first flowing through the yang pathways, then returning to the five organs and six bowls, thus forming the qi in fine increments. </p>
<p>Now, wealthy individuals do not comprehend their moderation, consuming rich and fatty foods mixed with strong flavors. Over time, these overly rich items, being the essence of yang, cannot move through the empty orifices and instead flow through the yin pathways, reversing the muscle structure. This leads to an overwhelming presence of dampness, causing the offspring to thrive at the expense of the mother, with fire becoming excessively vigorous. When damp heat is rampant, it must eventually attack the kidneys. If mixed with improper elements, it further undermines the true water. When the kidneys suffer from evil influences over time, the water becomes scarce; lacking water then leads damp heat to rise, causing ulcers to appear on the back and head, which represents the most severe form of large sores.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>If the poisonous gas travels through the lungs or the spleen and stomach, that is the next effect of the poison. If it emerges from other channels, that is secondary. The poison of dampness and heat causes ulceration wherever it settles. Hence, the classics say: the transformation of rich food can lead to severe boils; it is as if holding a vessel in a void. Just as a container receives things, it cannot resist absorbing everything. </p>
<p>To treat severe boils, one must certainly drain the vital energy. From the perspective of root and branch, the initial condition of the illness is the root; if not treated with bitter and cold medications as the primary remedy, it cannot eliminate the suffering and pain. Most sores and ulcers are painful, often treated with frankincense and myrrh mixed with aromatic medicines to relieve this pain; however, this will not necessarily lessen it. </p>
<p>If the meridians are unobstructed and flow through the organs, removing stagnation, there should be no pain. Bitter and cold drugs may alleviate the pain; when the medicine is swallowed, the pain will immediately cease; this is the supreme medicinal remedy. </p>
<p>Consuming meat with sores and ulcers is, in fact, self-neglect. Sores and ulcers arise from the vital energy, so supplementing them is no different from self-neglect. Even if medicines are applied, they may not lead to healing. For dampness from the earth that enters from the outside to the inside, it is essential to take medicine before using needles for treating sores and abscesses.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>If there are small sores or boils, and one does not wish to take medicine, or if it’s an infant’s sore, one should first cover it with warm clothing to help the blood and pulse flow evenly so that any bleeding stops immediately. Otherwise, if one punctures the congested blood vessels, the evil toxins will not be expelled, and it will harm the healthy flesh, aggravating the sore. For sores and other illnesses that cause a red face, even if there is latent heat, one must not force anything internally, as this causes the yang energy to become stagnant and allows the evil energy to remain in the channels. It is appropriate to promote sweating to expel it. Hence, it is said that stagnant fire must be released. Even if there hasn’t been a bowel movement for several days, one should focus on promoting yang energy, adding some moistening herbs to alleviate dryness. If one observes symptoms of wind pulse, only wind-expelling herbs should be used; this will help facilitate bowel movements. If only dryness is present, it is particularly important to moisten it and one must be cautious not to induce a purge. When sores and abscesses occur, commonly referred to as confusion, it is advisable to induce sweating for recovery. Treat the sores by their names and colors, according to &quot;Suwen&quot; and &quot;Zhenjing.&quot; The &quot;Shengji Zonglu&quot; contains details on various sores and their colors, but its prescriptions tend to focus on cold and cooling methods, lacking the transformative techniques. However, those like Yi Lao and Dongyuan emphasize important principles from &quot;Zhenjing,&quot; outlining key examples of pulse diagnosis and treatment. Scholars who are familiar with such discussions will be clear and confident when prescribing at the point of care.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Abscesses</h3>
<p>The conditions of boils, sores, and pustules arise from stagnation of qi and blood; therefore, one must assess their conditions of deficiency and excess, exterior and interior, and treat them promptly. If one can dissolve the issue internally, this aligns with the principle of &quot;expelling toxins.&quot; However, if the toxic energies have already consolidated, one should not rely solely on internal resolution; instead, one must distinguish between the presence or absence of pus and its depth. If pressure causes a recurrence, there is pus; if it does not, there is none. If pressing deeply causes pain, the pus is deep; if only light pressure causes pain, the pus is superficial. Immediate and careful judgment on whether to puncture is critical. If handled too slowly, it may penetrate the organs and damage muscles and bones—a caution not to be taken lightly! </p>
<p>Nevertheless, patients often prefer internal resolution, while doctors may resort to remedies like Shixuan Powder, Baiduxing Powder, or Liuqi Decoction. They are unaware that, though Shixuan Powder contains ginseng and astragalus, the other ingredients—fengming, angelica, magnolia, and balloon flower—are all depleting of qi. This is especially true when one indiscriminately uses them without consideration for the specific meridians, seasonal factors, or the quantity of qi and blood. Baiduxing Powder is a remedy for dispersing exterior conditions; even if there are exterior symptoms, it is only effective in one or two doses, and to use it when no exterior symptoms are present is inappropriate. Liuqi Decoction is designed to move qi and disperse blood, but if taken excessively, it can lead to deficiency of qi and depletion of blood. How can one then produce pus? Therefore, these three medicines should not be used lightly.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>If a wound has already formed pus, and the skin cannot expel it, the unknowing may wait for it to burst on its own, not realizing that the young and robust may resolve it themselves; however, in the case of the elderly or weak, with depleted Qi and blood, and if there is excessive heat attacking, without puncturing, the toxic pus may invade and damage the intestines and membranes, rarely without causing problems. For instance, in the case of the Shen family, with a milk abscess that had formed pus, I punctured it in time, and it healed within a month. For Huang Shang&#39;s leg abscess, where the pus was ripe but he was afraid of the needle, he almost reached a critical state; I punctured it, and he recovered after three months of substantial nourishment. Lian Qianbing had a leg abscess where both pulse and signs were weak; it was perilous, but I treated it by allowing the pus to be brought out and urgently used a needle; he refused, leading the pus-water to open and leak, and he could not recover and ultimately perished. Wang An&#39;s skin infection waited for it to burst, but the toxic gas attacked internally; Wang Gui&#39;s abdominal abscess burst through the belly and side, with foul gas escaping from the wound; I told him it would not heal on its own, and indeed, it did not. In general, the symptoms of sores and ulcers have their degrees of severity and depth; superficial ones are swollen and soft, arising from the blood vessels; deeper ones are hard and swollen, arising from the tendons and bones. Yet there are cases that arise from the marrow, where the flesh remains unchanged; when pus forms, those with strong Qi and blood may expel it on their own, while the weak may not be able to tolerate puncturing, with rare exceptions. Dong Yuan said: if the toxic gas cannot be resolved externally, and the pus cannot be expelled, if timely intervention is neglected, it will attack internally. Once internal decay occurs, how can one hope for recovery? I mention one or two cases for my colleagues to deliberate, to make patients aware of the need for caution.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br><strong>Promoting Flesh Growth and Alleviating Pain</strong></p>
<p>Muscles are governed by the spleen. The speed of healing after a wound closes is determined by the rise and fall of qi and blood. Practitioners today may only know to use substances like dragon’s blood and myrrh for promoting flesh growth and substances like乳 (milk) and myrrh for alleviating pain, adhering strictly to these methods. I argue otherwise. The proper method for promoting flesh growth should first focus on regulating the spleen and stomach to support qi and blood, allowing the muscles to regenerate naturally, thus not requiring substances like dragon’s blood. If purulent toxins remain and one uses methods to promote flesh growth, it could worsen the condition. For robust individuals, the situation may only lead to a recurrence of the wound or slow closure; but for the weak, a serious condition could lead to internal issues or an inability for the wound to close, which is perilous.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The methods for alleviating pain are as follows: for heat, use cooling remedies; for cold, use warming remedies; for excess, eliminate it; for deficiency, supplement it; for accumulated pus, open it up; for flesh that erodes, remove it. By doing this, the pain will naturally cease; do we really need the likes of myrrh or frankincense? For instance, when Huang Ruyun&#39;s back developed toxic gas that had not yet dissipated, early application of flesh-regenerating medicine led to ulceration; I treated it with detoxifying drugs, and he recovered. Xu Xuban suffered from this when the toxic gas first emerged; with the sudden use of flesh-regenerating remedies, the poison attacked internally and resulted in death. Wang Rudaol had a painful leg abscess caused by cold; I gave him pain-relieving pills with myrrh. Zhou Zhaoyi&#39;s mother suffered from temporal toxicity, which caused pain due to heat; I prescribed Fangfeng Tongseng Powder. Ding Lan had a buttock abscess that burst, causing pain due to deficiency; I provided Yiqi Yangrong Decoction. Liu Gui had an abdominal abscess causing pain due to excess; I gave him Huanglian Neishu Decoction. Wang Zhoushou had a painful leg abscess with established pus, for which I recommended incision. Yang Qianbing&#39;s mother developed back pain from rotting flesh; I removed it, and the pain immediately ceased. Alas! To treat heat with cold, cold with heat, to reduce excess and supplement deficiency—this is the standard for those who use medicines. If one exclusively relies on dragon&#39;s blood and flesh-regenerating remedies, myrrh and frankincense for pain relief, I fear their efficacy will be inadequate.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br><strong>On Bad Flesh</strong></p>
<p>Bad flesh refers to decayed meat. Generally, when there are tumors, abscesses, or wounds, bad flesh must be removed to make way for new growth. If a person is robust with strong muscles and sufficient vital energy and blood, they can truly overcome evil; in some cases, the issue resolves itself or stabilizes without causing harm. However, for older or weaker individuals, with less blood and weak muscles, bad flesh must be actively removed and taken away to bring order and lead to peace. If it is left untreated, there is a risk of rotting flesh and decayed muscles. For example, Liu Dayin and Madame Wang had their bad flesh removed in time, allowing new flesh to grow, leading to full recovery. Conversely, Jin Gongbu and Lu Sheren had their bad flesh removed too late, approaching the point of no return. Zheng Huishi failed to remove it in time, leading to decay and death. I have frequently observed that once bad flesh is removed, even those who are young and robust do not fully restore their vital energy and blood, while those who are weak and do not remove the bad flesh or replenish their energy and blood rarely survive.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br><strong>Swelling and Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>For swelling that is raised, hot, painful with a floating pulse, the evil is on the exterior, and it should be released. For swelling that is hard, painful, deep with a sinking pulse, the evil is internal, and it should be purged. If there is no heat or pain externally, but internally there is ease and harmony, the evil is in the meridians, and nourishment and defense should be regulated. If there is heat pain with restlessness, or dryness and thirst in the throat, it is necessary to reduce fire. For heat pain with fever, and possibly rigidity or headache, the evil is on the exterior and should be dispersed. If there is great pain or no pain, the evil qi is real, treat with garlic moxibustion and additionally use detoxifying methods. If there is restlessness with cold drinks and a rapid pulse with heat pain, the evil is in the upper body, and should be cleared. If there is aversion to cold but it does not fester, it is a combination of full qi and cold evil, and it should be released and supplemented. If there is heat pain with fever, excessive sweating, great thirst, and constipation with incoherent speech, it indicates a collapsed yang condition, and it should be purged. If it does not form pus or if it is ready but does not fester, it is a deficiency, and it should be supplemented.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>If the pus is mature but does not fester, it indicates a deficiency of yang qi, and it should be supplemented. If there is stagnant flesh that does not rot, it is advisable to greatly supplement yang qi and additionally use mulberry wood moxibustion. If the pus is clear or does not gather, it indicates deficiency of both qi and blood, and it should be greatly supplemented. If after pus discharge there is little appetite and no sleep, or if there is fever, it indicates deficiency, and it should be supplemented. If there is lethargy, reluctance to speak, little appetite, and no sleep, it indicates deficiency, and it should be supplemented. If cold qi attacks the wound and does not close, or if it sunken and does not close, warmth and supplementation should be applied. If the pulse is large but weak or fine and weak, it indicates deficiency of both qi and blood, and strong supplementation is necessary. If there is bleeding or excessive pus, restlessness, and insomnia, it indicates loss of yang, and urgent supplementation is required.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p>
<h3>Pain</h3>
<p>When pus emerges and there is a reverse pain, it indicates deficiency, and one should tonify it. If the pulse is rapid and weak with pain, it relates to a deficiency of Yang fire, and one should nourish Yin. If the pulse is rapid and strong with pain, it indicates an excess of pathogenic Qi, and one should dispel it. If the pulse is strong with constipation and pain, it indicates internal blockage, and one should purge it. If the pulse is thin and painful, it signifies deficiency of Qi and blood due to cold, and one should warm and tonify it.</p>
<h3>Fever</h3>
<p>If the pulse is floating or weak, accompanied by fever or aversion to cold, it indicates Yang Qi deficiency, and one should tonify Qi. If the pulse is thin and there is fever, it indicates blood deficiency, and one should tonify blood. For fever that occurs before noon, focus on tonifying Qi; for fever that occurs after noon, focus on tonifying blood. If the pulse is floating and rapid with fever and pain, it indicates that pathogenic factors are in the exterior, and one should disperse them. If the pulse is deep and rapid with fever and pain, it indicates that pathogenic factors are internal, and one should purge them.</p>
<h3>Thirst</h3>
<p>If the pulse at the wrist is large or weak with thirst, one should nourish Yin and reduce fire. If the upper pulse is deep and strong with thirst, one should drain fire. If the upper pulse is surging and rapid with thirst, one should reduce fire. If the stomach pulse is rapid and there is thirst, one should clear the stomach. If fire Qi is deficient and cannot produce fluids, causing thirst, one should tonify the central Qi. If the pulse is large and weak or feeble with thirst, one should tonify Qi and blood. If there is copious discharge of pus and blood, or thirst due to bleeding from a sore, one should greatly tonify Qi and blood; if there is no effect, urgently use Ginseng Decoction.</p>
<h3>Nausea</h3>
<p>If there is a preference for cold and aversion to heat with nausea, one should reduce fire. If there is a preference for heat and aversion to cold with nausea, one should nourish the stomach Qi. If the pulse is strong with constipation and nausea, one should drain fire. If the pulse is thin, accompanied by rumbling in the intestines, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea, one should warm the middle and support digestion.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br><strong>Constipation</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is deep and solid, it indicates internal heat, and one should release it. If the pulse is thin and secretive, it signifies a deficiency of blood, and one should nourish the blood. If the pulse is floating and secretive, it relates to Qi deficiency, and one should tonify Qi. If the pulse is both floating and thin, it indicates deficiency of both Qi and blood, and one should simultaneously replenish Qi and blood.</p>
<p><strong>Boils and Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is floating and rapid, disperse it; if it is deep and solid, purge it. If both the exterior and interior are solid, release the exterior while attacking the interior. For itching or severe pain, as well as for those that are painless, apply moxibustion and also attack the poison.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Moxibustion and Medicinal Methods</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials&quot; says: The classics state that all pain, itching, sores, and ulcers are related to heart fire. Predecessors also state that boils and carbuncles often arise in laborers exposed to Danstone. Anyone over forty who develops sores on the back should be treated promptly to prevent harm, as this condition is akin to a tiger entering the house—if not handled well, it will cause injury. One should first use the internal dispersing powder, then administer the Lianqiao Wuxiang Decoction, followed by the &quot;Horse Riding on Bamboo&quot; method or moxibustion with garlic separated, as well as moxibustion at Zu San Li to release the poison. Where evil gathers, the Qi must be deficient. If it lingers and does not leave, the illness becomes solid. Therefore, if boils and carbuncles have not yet ruptured, the organs contain toxins; any hot medications must not be used. If they have ruptured, and the organs are already depleted, then even a small amount of cold medicine must also be avoided. Additionally, it is advisable to refrain from using topical medications that would block the pores.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>If there is feverish thirst and constipation, with a pulse that is deep, strong, and rapid, it is advisable to use Da Huang and other medicines to drain the poison. Following this, one should choose from substances such as Guo Lao ointment, Wan Jin powder, wax alum pills, or Yuan Zhi wine for further treatment. </p>
<p>(Note: It is stated that if the symptoms indicate internal heat and toxins are consolidated with constipation, and there is no deficiency in vital energy, it is appropriate to use Da Huang and similar drugs to clear the heat and toxins. If there is deficiency in yin while yang is strong, with essence exhaustion and qi depletion, or if the spleen and stomach are weak, then warming medications should be used to strengthen the root. If sores are not inflamed and swollen, and do not produce pus, even if not yet ruptured, they still require warming and nurturing. If sores have ruptured but swelling persists and pain is unrelenting, cooling medicines should be utilized for treatment. In cases where the illness is acute but vital energy is strong, one should first treat the symptoms; if the illness is mild but vital energy is weak, one should first address the underlying issue. In cases of acute illness with greater weakness in vital energy, it is essential to first treat the root while also addressing the symptoms.)<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>Generally, if there is swelling, heat, and pain, with thick and sticky pus, the vital energy is not damaged, and treatment is relatively easy. If there is diffuse swelling with slight pain, and clear, thin pus, the vital energy is weak, making treatment difficult. If there is no swelling or pain, or if the swelling is diffuse, dark in color, and does not rupture, it arises from yin, indicating severe weakness of the vital energy, and should not be treated. </p>
<p>For high swelling and intense pain, first use the Xianfang Huo Ming drink, followed by the Tuo Li Xiao Du San. For diffuse swelling and slight pain, Tuo Li San is recommended; if it does not respond, add ginger and cassia. If pus emerges but there is pain again, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood, treated with Ba Zhen San. If there is no pus, no necrosis, it indicates deficiency of yang qi, treated with Si Jun Zi San plus Gui, Qi, and Rou Gui. If there is no muscle generation or astringency, it indicates deficiency of spleen qi, treated with Shi Quan Da Bu Tang plus ginger and cassia. </p>
<p>For afternoon heat and internal heat, it indicates deficiency of yin blood, treated with Si Wu Tang plus Ren Shen and Bai Zhu. If there is a desire to vomit or actual vomiting, it indicates deficiency of stomach qi, treated with Liu Jun Zi Tang plus Pao Jiang. For spontaneous sweating or night sweats, it indicates deficiency of the five internal organs, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan plus Wu Wei Zi.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>Eating little and feeling fatigued indicates deficiency of the spleen and qi; supplement with Bu Zhong Yi Qi and add Fu Ling and Ban Xia. If experiencing wheezing and cough, it suggests deficiency of the spleen and lungs; modify the previous decoction by adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi. For nausea and decreased appetite, indicating deficiency of the spleen and stomach, use Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang. For abdominal pain and diarrhea, hinting at cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach, apply Fu Zi Li Zhong Tang. If there&#39;s distension in the lower abdomen and swelling in the legs, suggesting weakness of the spleen and kidneys, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with additions of Shan Zhu Yu, Shan Yao, and Gui Gui. If there&#39;s diarrhea and cold feet, indicating cold deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, add Gui Zhi and Fu Zi to the previous remedy. For heat, thirst, and urinary difficulties, indicating yin fire deficiency of the kidneys, use Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan. For wheezing and urinary difficulties, indicating fire deficiency of the lungs and kidneys, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan. All these different conditions result from loss of original qi and failure to preemptively supplement. Therefore, Master Dan Xi stated: if one observes swelling and pain along with a pulse that indicates weakness, one should provide nourishment; if there is no deficiency of qi and blood, one can ensure a favorable outcome. Such words are profound! It should be noted that the nature of deficiency can differ between past and present, and treatment should be adjusted according to the time, which may have slight variations. This compilation of treatment discussions reflects that principle.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br><strong>Discussion II</strong></p>
<p>Initially, regarding the emergence of sores and boils, one must urgently use strong laxatives such as rhubarb, without concern for discomfort. If one must choose between allowing them to fester and die or to purge them and die, it is better to purge; moreover, there is the possibility of recovery! In ancient times, treatments typically invoked five spices, forsythia, and reed, and for the impoverished, a simple decoction of rhubarb was prepared to relieve them. Once pus begins to form, one should take astragalus and similar herbs to expel the pus, as outlined in the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; and &quot;External Treatments.&quot; Many have succumbed to sores on the exterior without purging. Alas! </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to previous evidence, if the swelling is high and painful, with internal organs congested, one should use the aforementioned medications to purge. If there is mild swelling with slight pain, and the organs are not congested, one should use internal tonics for support.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>If there is swelling without a head and the color of the flesh does not change, one should aid the stomach to strengthen its energy, allowing for internal resolution. If the pain persists and the swelling does not subside, one should use a ginseng and astragalus powder to release the abscess and expel pus. If appetite is poor and muscles do not develop, one should use a ginseng and astragalus powder to nourish and support the spleen and stomach. Danxi states that abscesses arise from accumulated toxins in the organs; one must first strengthen the stomach’s energy to solidify the foundation, and then use blood-moving medications as an adjunct, allowing the toxins to escape through the meridians in a timely manner, which can lead to internal resolution. This is the principle of internal expulsion. Furthermore, he says: if there is swelling and abscess both internally and externally, one should primarily use exterior dispersing medicines. If rhubarb is employed, could it not lack caution? In cases where both the internal and external are weakened, one should focus on nourishment and reinforcement; using fragrant powders could undoubtedly lead to a loss of vital essence. This indicates that the physiological constitution varies between past and present; hence, treatment should be carefully considered.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Moxibustion Method, Volume Three</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze said: In cases of abscess, the skin is thin and the swelling is high; in cases of ulcers, the skin is thick and the swelling is firm. Initially, both should be treated with moxibustion. However, when the pus of an abscess has formed, needling is appropriate, while when the pus of an ulcer has formed, cauterization is advisable. One must carefully examine the symptoms, alleviate the toxins, and nourish the internal organs. However, abscesses and ulcers rank at the top of various diseases, and improper treatment order often leads to dire consequences. Therefore, I have compiled effective moxibustion methods to benefit scholars, so that they do not mistakenly apply treatments.</p>
<p>[Note: In cases where there are symptoms like fever, thirst, and constipation, it indicates that pathogens are accumulating within. The internal toxin should be evacuated using Huanglian Decoction. If there is headache, rigidity, fever, and aversion to cold, this suggests an external pathogenic invasion, and Ren Shen Bai Du San should be used to disperse the exterior pathogens. If there is swelling, pain, heat, and thirst, this indicates that toxic energy is trapped in the flesh, and Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin should be used to disperse the toxins. If there is decreased appetite, fatigue, fever, and aversion to cold, this suggests weak spleen qi, and Liu Jun Zi Tang should be used to nourish the spleen and stomach.]<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br><strong>Method of Treating Wounds with Bamboo Horse Riding (Part Four)</strong></p>
<p>To treat all kinds of sores and ulcers, this method can be used, and none will go uncured. The method requires the patient to lean on a table with their elbow, keeping their straight arm. Use a piece of split bamboo, measuring from the bend of the wrist to the mid-finger tip, placing it against the flesh, not measuring the fingernail. </p>
<p>Next, use a bamboo pole to assist the patient who should disrobe and sit upright, supported at the front and back by two individuals to keep their feet off the ground. Two other people should help them maintain an upright posture. </p>
<p>Take the previously measured bamboo strip from the point just above the tailbone along the spine and mark the end of the measured strip with ink. This is merely to find the center point, not an acupuncture point. Then prepare a thin piece of bamboo as a measurement tool, measuring two finger sections from the patient&#39;s middle knuckle, placing it likewise (left for males, right for females). Mark this on both sides based on the earlier mark—this defines the acupuncture points. </p>
<p>Each point should be treated with five to seven moxa applications. If a sore is present on the left, apply moxa on the right; if on the right, apply on the left. In severe cases, apply to both sides.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>The area of these two points, through which the heart meridian passes, is where all boils and abscesses are caused by the toxins retained from heart fire. Moxa on these points will facilitate the flow of heart fire and disperse the toxins. The effectiveness of this method to bring the dead back to life has been repeatedly tested and proven.</p>
<p>[Note: If the poison has been resolved but the flesh does not regenerate, one should find its related point and nourish it.]</p>
<p>For males, use the left hand; for females, use the right hand. First, bend the middle finger and use a thin bamboo strip to measure from the end of the two horizontal lines in the middle section, marking this as one body inch. This is the first method.</p>
<p>Next, starting from the left arm for males and the right arm for females, measure from the wrist crease using a thin bamboo strip to the end of the middle finger’s flesh, not including the fingernail, and then cut it. This is the second method.</p>
<p>First, have the patient remove their clothing. Use a long bamboo pole to rest across them, ensuring it is secured by two people lifting it slowly until the feet are about five inches off the ground, with two others steadying it on either side to prevent shaking. Then apply the marking from the first diagram to the bamboo pole, starting from the tailbone and sticking up the spine, measuring to the end of the mark, and using ink to mark it. This is not a moxibustion point; it is a point to determine where to stop. </p>
<p>Using the second diagram, measure an equivalent length for one size, taking two inches and bending it halfway at the midpoint to measure two inches to each side; this is the actual moxibustion point. This is the third method.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br><strong>The Fifth Method of Garlic Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>Li says: The method for treating sores relies more on moxibustion than on medicine. It is essential to allow the toxic qi to escape, akin to a thief entering a house; one must open the door to chase them away, or else they will cause harm within. For sores that have just begun, within one or two days, one should use large cloves of garlic, slicing them three-tenths of an inch thick, and apply them directly on the sore. Moxibustion with mugwort should then be performed, alternating the garlic every three applications. If it causes pain, moxibustion should be conducted until the pain subsides; if there is no pain, it should be administered to induce discomfort. When the sore has ruptured, apply the miraculous ointment. By doing so, the sore will not enlarge, the flesh will not decay, and the wound will heal more swiftly, achieving three benefits in one act. This method&#39;s effectiveness is rarely known. However, if the head or neck shows signs of sores, this method should not be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regarding the symptoms of sores, those within will manifest externally; for external issues, draw them out, while for internal ones, disperse and descend them. If toxic qi is stagnant, causing blood to coagulate, milder symptoms can be alleviated with medicine, while more severe cases are not fully resolved through medicine, which is why the efficacy of moxibustion is paramount. Generally, for treating sores on the limbs where qi and blood are not deficient, using this method will lead to recovery. If the middle qi is weak, moxibustion should not be performed, and taking medicines to dispel toxins will further harm the middle qi, resulting in inevitable deterioration. Patients with head and neck conditions should also receive moxibustion; however, the mugwort sticks should be small, and the number of applications should be minimal for the best results.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br><strong>Sixth Method of Seeking the Head of Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>Li said: For those suffering from back sores that are swollen without a head, use damp paper to cover the swollen area, but first dry a small point, which indicates the sore&#39;s head. Take ten cloves of garlic, half a cup of fermented soybeans, and a small amount of frankincense, grind them into a paste and apply it to the sore, then place moxa over it. Whether it hurts or not should be determined by previous methods.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there are signs of bone sores or various poisons in the buttocks and legs that have just begun, using moxibustion to seek the head often helps resolve them internally. If the poison is severe, taking restorative medicine will yield faster results. However, if the qi and blood are weak, one should primarily use tonics. If a severe back sore has burst and you wish to check if it has penetrated the inner membrane, do not use the soapwort sneezing method. Instead, seal the affected area with paper and have the patient breathe intentionally; if the paper does not move, it has not penetrated. If you use sneezing to agitate the inner membrane, it may lead to penetration. Be cautious! Be cautious!<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br><strong>Section 7: The Division of Light and Heavy Using Garlic Cakes</strong></p>
<p>Wu&#39;s statement: In using garlic cakes for moxibustion, garlic is pungent, warm, and toxic, acting to disperse abscesses and boils, relying on the potency of fire to transmit the effects of the medicine. If one uses only an moxa stick, this can be applied to stubborn sores that have long manifested. For cases of severe red swelling, purple-black toxicity, it is best to moxibust with garlic and moxa together. </p>
<p>[Note: The previous method indeed has the power of revival. If the stubborn sore is due to chronic illness and the spleen and stomach are weak, making it so that the vital energy cannot nourish the affected area, resulting in internal cold evils invading and not healing, it is advisable to use small moxa sticks to frequently moxibust the sore&#39;s opening, to dispel the cold evil and replenish the nourishing energy. The method for internal replenishment is discussed in the first discourse and the thirty-second discourse.]</p>
<p><strong>Section 8: The Essential Discussion on Moxibustion Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Wu&#39;s discourse states: The onset of abscesses and boils on the back is due to specific causes, as detailed in the previous chapter. Upon first noticing redness and swelling, one should start from the second hollow on either side of the spine, each 1.5 inches from the body, known as the &quot;Heat Organ Points,&quot; and moxibust each point seven times. This can help to discharge excess Yang heat and eliminate the suffering of abscesses and boils; if moxibusting with garlic is used, the number of applications does not matter, as the evil has no place to reside, while the true energy is preserved. However, if sores appear on the head and neck, it is advisable to use the sitting-on-a-bamboo-horse method along with moxibustion at the &quot;Zusanli&quot; point (Stomach 36). </p>
<p>[Note: The previous discussion is indeed a good strategy. The method of regulation should be sought in the first discussion.]<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Moxibustion for Pain and Itching - Part Nine</strong></p>
<p>Wushi said: When treating boils, carbuncles, shoulder sores, if there is no pain, it is essential to perform moxibustion to induce pain; if there is pain, moxibustion should be done to alleviate it. If pain occurs immediately upon moxibustion, it indicates shallow toxic qi; if there is no pain during moxibustion, the toxic qi is deep and heavy. It is necessary to take internal medicines to expel the toxins and discharge pus, and to apply external medications that draw out the toxins. Generally, boils and carbuncles cannot be entirely painless, but they should not be excessively painful. Cases where there is confusion and lack of awareness of pain are difficult to treat.</p>
<p>[Note: In previous discussions, only the sore condition was mentioned; its symptoms vary widely, with different appearances and colors—some resemble small sores, some like blisters, some are painful, some numb, some have red threads, and others may cause fever, headache, nausea, or muscle stiffness. These symptoms are numerous, and without the previous moxibustion methods and detoxifying agents, it is hard to achieve any effect. If a patient is unresponsive or has tightly clenched teeth, then use the life-reviving powder, ground into fine powder, to administer. When occurring on both legs, often there are red threads reaching to the navel; on both hands, there are usually red threads reaching to the heart; on the lips and face, red threads may reach the throat—all of these are hard to treat. If the red threads are needled to produce bleeding, many will survive. If it attacks the extremities, the toxins become even more stagnated, making it difficult for the medicine to reach; therefore, moxibustion is very important. If one improperly takes purging agents, it depletes genuine qi, not only failing to expel the toxins but potentially causing further harm.]<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br><strong>Method of Moxibustion for Brain Abscess, Chapter Ten</strong></p>
<p>Li states: For brain abscess and abscesses in the neck, do not use garlic to moxibust, as it may cause the poison to rise and attack. It is advisable to moxibust the Zusanli point with five cones, the Qihai point with three to seven cones, and also take medicines that cool the blood and transform toxins, or use the method of moxibustion at the Qimama point. In general, abscesses that arise in the head, neck, and throat are traditionally considered untreatable. However, using this method has resulted in many recoveries. Herbs such as Wuxiang Lianqiao, Leolu decoction, Guolao ointment, and Wanjin powder can be selected for use.</p>
<p>[Note: The previous symptoms belong to the Bladder channel, which may be due to damp-heat stagnation or yin fire flaring upwards. If caused by damp-heat, the pathogenic qi is excessive and the vital qi is insufficient, then Huanglian Xiaoduo San should be used to eliminate damp toxins, along with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If caused by yin fire, both the vital qi and pathogenic qi are insufficient, then Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pill should be used to nourish the kidney water. If kidney water is depleted and the condition has reached a late stage, immediately use the modified Bawei Pill and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to solidify the foundation and draw the fire back to its source. If the color is dark and does not ulcerate, or ulcerates without healing, it is termed &quot;brain scorching,&quot; which is untreatable. Generally, if there is severe swelling and pain, it is advisable to use the Lifesaving Decoction for moxibustion with garlic to dissolve stagnant blood and draw out the accumulated poison, but the moxa cones should be small and few. If pus is desired to form and ulcerate, along with promoting tissue regeneration and healing, Toli should be the main focus.]<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br><strong>On Protecting the Internal Organs, Section Eleven</strong></p>
<p>Li states: Although there are many remedies for back sores, very few prove effective. Now, I select and record those that have been tested, so as not to mislead others. For instance, the Heart Protecting Powder is to be administered early for any sore disease; taking several doses helps expel toxic substances without causing vomiting. Otherwise, there may be sores in the throat, mouth, or tongue, or they might turn black and rotten like fungus. If the sores appear after four or five days, it is advisable to use other medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Heart Protecting Powder is a remedy for sores caused by metal or stone. If there is fever, swelling, and thirst with vomiting after drinking cold drinks, it is suitable to use. If there is fever, swelling, and thirst with vomiting after drinking broth, it is not advisable to use it. If there is spleen deficiency leading to phlegm stagnation, or internal cold evasion, or pain injuring the spleen and stomach, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used. If there are sores on the throat and tongue, dry mouth, thirst, or frequent urination, the Six Flavors Pill is recommended. Generally, if sores induce vomiting and drinking cold leads to constipation, it indicates heat toxicity, which can be relieved with the Huang Lian Xie Du Powder. If drinking cold facilitates bowel movements, it suggests stomach fire, which can be cleared with Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. If there is loss of appetite with broth, it indicates stomach deficiency; use the Central Qi Fortifying Decoction to replenish. If the stool is loose, and one prefers hot broth, it indicates cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach; the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger should be used to warm it. It is commonly observed that those with weak spleen and stomach often use the preceding powder, which can lead to cold and discomfort in the heart, inevitably resulting in vomiting. The sores on the throat and tongue are due to dehydration of kidney water and upward flaming of deficient fire. This condition is quite serious; promptly using the Adjusted Eight Flavor Pill may lead to recovery.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Abscesses, Chapter Twelve</strong></p>
<p>Ma Yiqing said: The human body has four limbs and five organs, with sensations of wakefulness and sleep, breathing in and out, the flow of essential energy, circulating as nourishment and defense, manifesting as vitality and complexion, expressed through sound. Yang reflects physical form, while Yin represents essence; these are common principles. When there is disturbance, heat arises if the body steams, otherwise, cold develops. If it solidifies, it becomes lumps; if it sinks, it transforms into abscesses; if it congeals, it results in sores and skin issues; frustration leads to goiters, while anger causes abscesses. Furthermore, if the five organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices will be obstructed; if the six Qi are not harmonious, stagnation leads to abscesses. All are due to blocked meridians, with Qi and blood not flowing smoothly, allowing wind and toxins to seize the opportunity and cause these conditions. [Note: This discussion can be considered a profound analysis of the human body&#39;s transformation and the conditions of sores and ulcers. Treatment methods should refer to previous discussions.]<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br><strong>Discussion Thirteen</strong></p>
<p>The condition of abscesses, if caused by the depletion of emotional states (the seven emotions), leading to stagnation of qi and blood in the meridians, falls under internal causes. If it is an external invasion by the six pathogenic factors, resulting in injury to qi and blood, with cold transforming into abscesses, that belongs to external causes. If it arises from the consumption of alchemical substances, tonics, rich foods, or excessive labor, it is a combined internal and external cause. Furthermore, it is said that stagnation of yin leads to abscesses, while stagnation of yang results in carbuncles. A floating, rapid, slippery pulse indicates yang, while a sinking, slow, thick pulse indicates yin. Yin is treated with heat, and yang with cold. In the initial stage, the focus should be on clearing heat and expelling toxins; once there is a rupture, the aim should be to drain pus and alleviate pain. Hence, one uses compounds such as polygala, rhubarb, and licorice, representing these three causal methods. The treatment should warm what is cold, clear what is hot, tonify what is deficient, and drain what is excessive, guided by acupuncture, cauterization with moxa, or breaking up toxins and softening hardness, all adhering to established principles, aiming for equilibrium.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>According to the notes, if the pulse is deep and solid, and there is constipation, it indicates an internal cause, and one should use methods to relieve and unblock. If the pulse is superficial and the bowel movements are regular, it indicates an external cause, and one should use methods to promote. If the pulse is neither superficial nor deep, it indicates neither internal nor external causes, and one should harmonize the defensive and nutritive qi. This is also a method of treating the three causes. If there is swelling, severe pain, restlessness, heat, a preference for cold drinks, constipation, and a pulse that is surging, rapid, and solid, this is pure Yang, and bitter-cold herbs should be used to clear heat and expel toxins. Conversely, if there is no swelling or pain, there is diarrhea, a lack of appetite, vomiting, and cold extremities, this is pure Yin, and warming, spicy herbs should be used to greatly supplement Yang qi. Regardless of whether it is extreme cold or intense heat, one should adjust based on the condition. If there is slight swelling and slight pain, resembling a potential abscess but occasionally discharging clear pus, this is half Yin and half Yang, and one should use warming, spicy herbs to tonify the stomach qi. This is also a method for treating Yin and Yang conditions; detailed experiences can be found in the earlier discussions.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Plain Questions, Chapter Fourteen</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: When the yang qi gathers and strikes, cold transforms into heat. When heat is excessive, flesh rots into pus. Generally, back abscesses are often caused by taking metals and stones, or from previous generations who took such substances. The symptoms often arise from the spleen, appearing like grains, sometimes painful or itchy, often leading to severe conditions, appearing externally like a fist. The ancients described the outside as similar to hemp and the inside like a melon. There are several dozen openings; when pressed, pus may emerge from them, and one may lose their voice for a time. For this condition, one may use pure earth water, mixing it into a thick paste for cakes, and moxibustion with mugwort sticks. Internally, consume a Five-Spice and Lianqiao decoction, and apply a mix of iron essence and vinegar with clam shell ash. Furthermore, use the riding bamboo horse technique for moxibustion, which is quite effective.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of the Thousand Gold, Chapter Fifteen</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: When boils and carbuncles first occur, there may be either great pain or minor pain, or if something appears like a grain, pus will surely emerge. It is advisable to urgently cut off sour tastes and eliminate the poison, using the riding bamboo horse moxibustion technique, or directly burning mugwort on the affected area. For severe cases, thicken moxibustion at the central and surrounding areas with one or two hundred vigorous applications, and additionally apply cold remedies; the effect is remarkably swift.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Differentiating Symptoms of Abscesses, Part Sixteen</strong></p>
<p>Wu stated: The diseases of carbuncles manifest in over twenty symptoms, including sudden onset (early-stage), chronic onset, stone-like nodules, rock-like nodules, bee-hive nodules, lotus-like nodules, peppery-nodules, string-of-pearls nodules, and nodules that appear in the entire body. Internally, there are abscesses in the intestines, on the brain&#39;s back, in the eyebrows, in the jaw and cheeks, as well as lung abscesses and melon-husk abscesses. Generally, treatment should be adjusted based on the severity of the illness and should be applied both internally and externally without delay. When onset is like a floating and tense pulse due to a cold injury, this indicates the condition. </p>
<p>(Note: Although these symptoms have different names, the treatment methods are detailed elsewhere. Lung and gastric abscesses are separately recorded.)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Symptoms, Part Seventeen</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze stated: In cases of abscesses, the pulse is rapid, there is no fever, but the patient experiences severe chills; if there is a painful area, this indicates an abscess. When feeling over the area, if it feels hot, it indicates the presence of pus; if not hot, there is no pus. If the pulse is not rapid, and there is no fever but pain, it indicates a condition arising from the Yin, which is particularly serious. When heat is severe and the pulse is rapid, a remedy should include Luoluo Powder and decoctions of rhubarb. If there is not much heat and the pulse is weak and slow, use Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction, following the order of the four seasons and eight conditions for medication; there will be no case that does not respond positively.</p>
<p>(Note: The symptoms of severe chills may relate to external pathogens of the sore, or to internal deficiency of the spleen and lungs. If after an abscess ruptures there is swelling and pain with severe chills, fever, thirst, and a rapid pulse, this indicates true qi deficiency and full evil qi; further consultation of the main text is advised for detailing.)<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br><strong>Outline for Medication, Section 18</strong></p>
<p>Li states: My writings on formulas are comprehensive, intending for the practitioners to savor and apply them sequentially, with no chance of ineffectiveness. Here, I briefly outline the essential points for medication, organized as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>For the initial onset of carbuncles or sores, take internal herbs immediately to prevent mouth sores later, and apply moxa or garlic for cauterization.</li>
<li>If taking Wuxiang Lianqiao decoction, stop if bowel movements are swift; still, gauge the person&#39;s deficiency and excess.</li>
<li>After a carbuncle or sore has suppurated, it is advisable to take a dispersing and nourishing formula; if there are vomiting or reversal symptoms, administer a wood fragrance decoction.</li>
<li>When a carbuncle or sore first appears, it is best to apply moxa, and use mixtures of rice flour and gypsum around the area while allowing the toxic matter to exit through the mouth. If the sore is small, apply dressings thoroughly; once it has ruptured, use a miraculous ointment for application.</li>
<li>For an already ruptured carbuncle or sore, wash daily with pig trotter soup, which promotes healing; do this every three days.</li>
<li>When the carbuncle or sore is nearing closure, use the miraculous ointment; if there is still remaining toxicity, one must not hastily apply agents that regenerate flesh.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>When a carbuncle appears, it is advisable to use the modified &quot;Ten Complete Nourishing Decoction&quot; to replenish Qi and blood, facilitating the growth of muscles. A back carbuncle often manifests with thirst preceding its onset, or thirst following the appearance, leading to much distress. Taking the modified &quot;Eight Flavor Pill&quot; not only prevents thirst-related ailments but also greatly enriches Qi and blood, promoting muscle growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two types of vomiting associated with a carbuncle: one is caused by the initial outbreak not being treated with &quot;Nei Tuo San,&quot; resulting in hidden heat in the heart; the other is due to improper spleen Qi. If the cause is hidden heat in the heart, one would feel restless with body heat, experiencing swelling and pain; in this case, three doses of &quot;Nei Tuo San&quot; should be administered. If due to improper spleen Qi, there would be no restlessness or heat, but nausea triggered by foul smells; here, &quot;Jia He San&quot; should be used. If there are chills and fevers, &quot;Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San&quot; should be employed, alongside the use of &quot;Shan Yao Wan&quot; early in the morning to nourish the kidneys.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br><strong>Vomiting and Reversal (Section 19)</strong></p>
<p>Li states: “The presence of carbuncles and vomiting is due to toxic energy invading the heart, not the coldness of the spleen and stomach; one should take internal expelling powders.” Yang states: “If nosebleeds just healed and there hasn’t been sweating on the surface, then the toxins are within the meridians, leading to large carbuncles on the back. From the shoulders down to the waist and flanks, there is swelling hard as stone, with a purple-black hue. If cool medicines are administered, there will be vomiting throughout the night. Continuing with the expelling powders will stop the vomiting, leading to ulceration with reddish fluids, healing in forty days. Additionally, there are those who suffer from ulcers, where pain leads to vomiting. Taking this will stop the vomiting.” Now if there are patients with carbuncles who do not take this medicine, I reference Yang’s words to clarify the confusion of the world.<br><em>Note: According to medical practice, certain illnesses must use specific remedies. However, in today&#39;s cases, the majority experience weakness and coldness in the spleen and stomach, with reversed qi and phlegm causing nausea. Only a small percentage suffer from internal heat toxins leading to vomiting; this should be considered with the first discussion and the main points of the eleventh discussion.</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Source (Section 20)</strong></p>
<p>The source of carbuncles arises from either qi or heat; as I see it, it can also stem from improper food and excess of rich, fatty meals, or from sexual excess leading to the use of metals and stones. Therefore, the treatment should include mung beans, rhinoceros horn, alum, Gualao ointment, and the Zhuidu pills, all undeniably toxic. What Hua Tuo mentioned in &quot;Zhongcang&quot; refers to toxins; taking medicine that clears heat and eradicates toxins is assuredly necessary.<br><em>Note: If prior evidence indicates it is caused by metals and stones, then for those with abundant vital energy, this method is indeed advisable. But if heat from rich foods has piled up, or if there is excessive sexual activity, or weakness in the spleen and kidneys, the source of transformation should be nourished and not rigidly enforced.</em><a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br><strong>Hua Tuo&#39;s Discussion, Chapter Twenty-One</strong></p>
<p>The occurrence of sores, swellings, and ulcers arises when the organs accumulate toxins that do not flow; it is not solely due to the obstruction of nourishment and defense. Their manifestations have specific locations and principal causes. For example, if they appear on the throat or tongue, it is the heart&#39;s toxin; if on the muscles, it is the spleen&#39;s toxin; if on the bones and marrow, it is the kidney&#39;s toxin; if they erupt from below, it comes from the yin toxins, and if from above, from the yang toxins; externally, it is the toxins of the six bowels, and internally, it is the toxins of the five organs. Therefore, what occurs internally is termed &quot;bad,&quot; externally it is termed &quot;follow,&quot; and what occurs below is termed &quot;reverse.&quot; Manifestations from above develop quickly, while those from below develop slowly. When affected by the six bowels, treatment is easier; when affected by the five organs, recovery is difficult. </p>
<p>Moreover, conditions near the bones are often cold, while those near the skin are often hot. If it lingers near the bones, it may transform into blood worms; if near the skin, it may lead to leaks of energy. When worms develop, there is often more itching and less pain, sometimes itching first and pain later; with leaks, there is often more pain and less itching, or neither pain nor itching. In cases where there is internal deficiency and external surplus, there tends to be more pain and less itching; if bleeding does not stop, there is a higher chance of death, while suppuration often leads to recovery. </p>
<p>Occasionally, there is boundless vomiting or reversal, and meals may be taken at irregular times; these are all effects of sores and ulcers, with varied symptoms. Careful treatment is essential. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The emergence of worms in sores and ulcers is attributed to wind-heat from the liver, while leaks stem from weakened vital energy; bleeding is associated with spleen deficiency accompanied by heat, and suppuration indicates robust vital energy. Conditions like vomiting and reversal are caused by deficiencies in the spleen and stomach, and one should focus on tonifying the vital energy to ensure safety.]</strong><a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br><strong>On the Original Causes</strong></p>
<p>There are five causes: First, the body is weak and energy is stagnated; second, there is excess anger; third, kidney energy is deficient; fourth, consuming cold beverages and excessive hot food; fifth, taking medicinal pills. (Note: Although the causes of preceding symptoms may differ, the treatment should also consider the respective meridians, yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and the exterior and interior swellings, primarily strengthening the stomach and enhancing energy, thereby solidifying the foundation to ensure safety.)</p>
<p><strong>On Distinguishing Between Exterior and Interior</strong></p>
<p>The Wu clan states: Boils and sores arise from unpredictable emotions, irregular diet, imbalance of yin and yang, disharmony of organs, loose pores, and cold air invading the meridians. If the blood and energy are chilled, they may stagnate and not flow, leading to exterior pathogens. When confronted with cold, it obstructs and prevents flow; if yang energy accumulates, it can lead to alternating cold and heat, which will not disperse, resulting in previous symptoms. Furthermore, all the points of the five organs and six bowels are located on the back. In general, wounds are prone to injure the membranes of the organs, often leading to failure in treatment. The bowels&#39; energy flows near the surface, hence exterior boils are easier to treat; while the blood of the organs is cold and resides deep, making internal sores more difficult to treat. It is also mentioned that a festering boil is a &quot;jie&quot; (section), an abscess is a &quot;yong&quot; (obstruction), and a sore is a &quot;ju&quot; (depression). A size of one to two inches is a boil, three to five inches is an abscess, five inches to one foot is a sore, and one to two feet is a severe sore. If the pulse is rapid and surging, treatment is difficult; if the pulse is weak and stagnant, treatment is easier.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>Initially, one should clear heat and expel toxins. Once an abscess has formed, focus on draining pus and relieving pain; when the pus is fully expelled, promote tissue regeneration and scabbing. The approach should be adapted based on the severity of the condition and the clinical signs.</p>
<p>(Note: If there is a lack of appetite due to anxiety, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen and stomach; if there is no response, add ginger and cinnamon for warmth and support, aiding in the withdrawal of pathogenic influences. If no improvement is seen, it indicates that the pathogenic influence is strong and the vital energy is deficient, preventing resolution, which can take about ten days. If it has already manifested, use the Decoction to Promote Recovery and Detoxify to enhance vital energy and assist in the drainage of pus; if there is no response, warmth and nourishment of the spleen and stomach is necessary. If there is still no response, the cause may be a deficiency in true energy, which prevents the formation of pus, and this can appear beyond twenty days. If suppuration has occurred, use the Decoction to Promote Recovery to nourish qi and blood, and generate muscle; if there is still no response, focus on nurturing the spleen and stomach; if there is still no response, warmth and nourishment of the spleen and stomach is necessary. If there is no improvement, this indicates that the spleen qi is insufficient to consolidate, which can appear beyond one month. This treatment method, I have often verified, is elaborated in the initial discourse.)<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br><strong>On External and Internal Conditions, Section 24</strong></p>
<p>Li stated: When a boil first appears as a small lump like a soybean, accompanied by heat, swelling, and redness, this indicates an external manifestation. Although the condition may be intense, proper treatment can preserve life. However, if initially there is no heat, the body feels fatigued, the affected area remains unchanged, and after several days there is no swelling or pain, the internal organs may be damaged. In such cases, even effective remedies like those from Lu or Bian may have no effect. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There are instances where conditions arise from deficiency of vital energy preventing proper expression, from the application of cold medicines inhibiting expression, or from overexertion damaging qi and blood hindering expression. Generally, conditions stemming from internal heat toxins that lose their ability to be released can be examined and treated, with many surviving.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br><strong>The Treatment Methods of Yin and Yang - Chapter 25</strong></p>
<p>Zeng said: In cases of boils and sores, the pulse is floating, rapid, surging, and tight; there is swelling, pain, body heat, and thirst. Eating and drinking remain normal. This indicates disharmony in the six fu organs, with toxins manifesting externally as boils. Although the situation is urgent, administering cooling remedies often preserves life. If the pulse is deep, thin, suppressed, and tight; the onset is very mild, sometimes without visible sores; the body does not heat up, but there is internal restlessness, a heavy and painful body, a lack of joy, chest tightness, and lack of taste in food; this indicates disharmony in the five zang organs, with toxins accumulating internally, leading to sores. In this case, quickly administer the Five Spice and Forsythia Decoction; in more severe cases, use detoxifying dispersals, celestial spirit intercepting method, yellow alum pills, or national elder ointment to prevent the emission of toxic qi and avoid transformation into more serious internal attacks. It is particularly advisable to perform garlic moxibustion at the crown of the head. If toxic medicaments are applied, they may obstruct the pores; if cooling medicines are administered, they may deplete the true qi. Therefore, the quality of the symptoms—good or bad—depends on the skill of the physician. Manifestations such as sighing, blockage, reverse cough, cold body with spontaneous sweating, wide-eyed and deaf, confusion and shock, disjointed speech, are all adverse symptoms. If five good signs are evident, recovery is likely; if seven bad signs are present, danger is imminent. When five good signs are simultaneously present, there is nothing more to add to the goodness; when seven bad signs all converge, then the severity of the bad condition is grave.</p>
<p><em>[Note: The good signs mentioned earlier imply that the five organs have not been harmed, the illness is mild and the invasion shallow, allowing for careful conduct of daily life and moderation in food intake to achieve self-healing without medicine. The bad symptoms indicate damage to the five organs; although ancient scholars said not to treat them, if one can strengthen the spleen and stomach, reinforcing the foundation, there are many who can survive. How can one abandon them solely because of their bad condition?]</em><a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>Questions were asked: What are the five goods and seven evils? The answer: Consuming food and drink as usual is one good; experiencing clear bowel movements despite heat is two goods; the internal and external ailments being interconnected is three goods; having distinct muscle tone is four goods; using medicine as prescribed is five goods. </p>
<p>As for evils: Experiencing thirst with wheezing and having bowel movements that are slippery is one evil; having a weak pulse that runs counter to the illness is two evils; having blurred vision with sunken eyes is three evils; having necrotic tissue that is sunken and black is four evils; having necrosis that is blue-black with decaying tendons and bones is five evils; producing phlegm is six evils; vomiting is seven evils. </p>
<p>[Note: The methods for diagnosing goods and evils can be found in the appendix.]<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br><strong>On Life and Death, Section 27</strong></p>
<p>A question was asked: Some illnesses are severe leading to death, while others are mild leading to death; the symptoms are difficult to discern. How can we determine life and death? The answer is: If the back erupts and penetrates the inner membrane, that is death (this refers to conditions related to the liver). If it has not penetrated and the face is pale and lips black, that indicates death (this means the organs are damaged and there is stagnant blood). If there is a throat ulcer, it is incurable. If there is a hidden ailment in the abdomen, it is incurable. If it enters the sac, it is incurable. If the temples are deeply sunk by several inches, it is also incurable. Located one inch and three-tenths behind the jaw, this condition, called sharp poison, is likewise incurable. If none of these conditions are present, there is hope for life. Even if the flow is excessive, treatment must lead to recovery. </p>
<p>(Note: Previous conditions may arise from the weakness of original energy causing toxic energy to penetrate inward; from an initial condition due to a failure in internal balance of the spleen and defensive qi; from excess toxins resulting from incapacity to properly disperse; from weakness resulting from inadequate supplementation; from the formation of pus due to failure in puncture therapy; from corruption leading to failure in nourishment.)<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>If there is a backbrain abscess due to damp-heat accumulation, use Huanglian Xiaodu San and Buzhong Yiqi Tang to eliminate dampness and toxins, nourish the spleen and lungs, and enrich kidney water. If there is a sharp toxin in the temples belonging to wind-heat, use Chaihu Shanzhizi San to clear liver fire and nourish liver blood. If there is yin deficiency, take Liuwei Dihuang Wan to generate kidney water and nourish the source of transformation. If the condition is in the lower abdomen, replenish the blood of the three yin to nourish the spleen and stomach qi, which may help preserve life. The symptoms of flowing and dripping may arise from dietary fatigue, sexual depletion of yin, or emotional disturbances and external invasions, leading to blood deficiency and stagnation, or postnatal blood stasis resulting in a continued flow or masses and swelling; for this, use Yiqi Yangrong Tang to stabilize original qi, assist with scallion poultices to disperse stagnation, and apply fermented soybean cakes to dispel cold evil. If there is prolonged suppuration with stagnant flesh inside, use a needle to disperse decay, as many can still recover. However, if one does not adhere to dietary restrictions and management, it may lead to worsening conditions, so be cautious!<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p>
<h3>Clarification of Symptoms in Reverse and Forward (28th Section)</h3>
<p>After a carbuncle or boil has erupted, the body may exhibit both adverse and favorable signs. </p>
<ol>
<li>Eye symptoms such as a white sclera with black spots indicate a malady; </li>
<li>Inability to ingest food, vomiting after taking medicine, and food tasting dull are further negative signs; </li>
<li>Severe pain and intense thirst are the third adverse symptoms; </li>
<li>Stiffness in the body and a heavy feeling in the limbs constitute the fourth negative sign; </li>
<li>Hoarseness, pallor, cyanosis in the lips and nose, and facial swelling indicate the fifth evil symptom; </li>
<li>Restlessness, coughing, severe abdominal pain, extreme thirst, uncontrollable diarrhea, and urinary issues are the sixth adverse signs; </li>
<li>Profuse discharge of purulent blood, significant swelling and pain, and foul purulent color represent the seventh negative sign; </li>
<li>Shortness of breath, shallow breathing, confusion, and excessive drowsiness constitute the eighth adverse symptom; </li>
<li>If the wound is black and sunken, with a bluish face, dark lips, and soiled stools, this indicates the ninth negative sign; </li>
<li>Symptoms such as a sensation of obstruction in the chest, cough accompanied by cold body temperature, spontaneous sweating, vacant stare, hearing loss, confusion, heart palpitations, and disordered speech are the tenth adverse sign.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, the head is associated with various Yang energies, while the neck is close to the throat, and acupuncture points near the kidney area are all critical. None of these areas should be subjected to cautery or moxibustion!</p>
<p><em>Note: The initial symptoms of black and sunken conditions, bluish pallor, darkened lips, and discolored stools indicate severe internal decay of the organs. Symptoms of obstruction, cough with cold, and spontaneous sweating indicate a deficiency of the spleen and lungs. Inability to eat or diarrhea, bowel noises, and deafness with vacant stares suggest degeneracy between the spleen and kidney. Treatment methods are detailed in the appendix.</em><a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>From diarrhea and vomiting, not able to take in food and drink, the kidney pulse is extremely deficient. Such a condition, the ancients considered irremediable; however, there is still a rationale for treatment. </p>
<p>(Note: The preceding discussion reveals the subtleties of the &quot;Neijing,&quot; opening the ears and eyes of generations, and its benefits are vast! This condition indeed indicates a decline of the fire at the life gate, unable to generate the earth of the spleen, leading to deficiency and coldness, resulting in diarrhea and vomiting. It may present as chest and diaphragm discomfort, inability to digest food, or loose stools. One should use the Eight Flavor Pill and the Six Gentlemen Decoction with ginger and prepared Aconite. If it’s due to excessive sexual activity, with true Yang in decline, or a congenital deficiency that cannot generate the earth of the spleen, leading to inability to take in food, use the Ren Shen and Huang Qi formulas with Aconite, ginger, and cinnamon, along with the Dongyuan Prescriptions for replenishing true Yang, many have survived. If one uses ginseng and astragalus solely to boost the spleen and stomach, few will escape error. If one mistakenly treats it as an internal attack of toxic Qi, it will not recover.)<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>Treating Illnesses Should Be Done Early</p>
<p>The Wu family states: When a carbuncle appears, the skin is thin and the swelling is high, often with numerous black spots; when an abscess appears, the skin is tough, resembling the hide of a cow. Both conditions should be treated with cautery using moxa. If a carbuncle forms pus, it should be needled using a horseshoe-shaped iron needle, which is sharp on both sides and can be used to make cuts of about five or six inches to drain the toxic blood, after which the condition will improve significantly. Cauterization should be done first, followed by incision. One may take the Immortal’s Pursuit of Toxins pill to help eliminate the toxic roots, then follow with medicines that help drain pus and regulate the body.</p>
<p>If an abscess forms pus, cauterization is advisable. Use a silver rod, about one inch wide and six inches long, heated until red, and frequently cauterize the affected area until the pus is expelled. Generally speaking, carbuncles and abscesses are more difficult to treat than other ailments; without the heart’s transmission of secret techniques, can they be easily cured? </p>
<p>[Note: If the vital energy and blood are robust and pus has formed, it is essential to needling promptly, without relying solely on medicines to heal. If the vital energy and blood are deficient, the pus may not be able to drain, or it may cause pain when it does, necessitating care to nourish the stomach to ensure a favorable outcome. See more in Chapter 40.]<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br><strong>Thirty: Moistening and Refreshing</strong></p>
<p>The Wu family states: One may feel a red, itchy swelling and pain between the shoulder blades, possibly accompanied by white spots. It should be moistened with saliva and one must not scratch it open. Generally, there may be slight red swelling on the back, which could result from scratching, bathing, or from consuming raw or spicy foods. Initially, if the condition is unclear, moisten it and use a medicated paste. If there is swelling and redness, it is best to apply warm moxa directly to the affected area. Many people mistakenly believe that excess heat causes the condition to spread, leading to numerous errors! </p>
<p>(Note: In cases of abscess on the back, if there is necrosis with pus oozing and persistent pain, it may be due to a layer of muscle tissue that prevents the pus from draining. Using a needle to draw it out is advisable. For elderly or weak individuals, waiting for it to rupture naturally can often lead to severe consequences, so careful diagnosis is necessary!)<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br><strong>On Recognizing Colors and Preventing Spread (Chapter 31)</strong></p>
<p>Wu said: If there is a sore that is swollen and red, and pressing it does not change its color, this indicates that pus has already formed. If pressing it causes the color to change with your hand, there is also pus present. If pressing it takes a long time to turn red, this indicates that the wandering toxin has subsided; cauterization can be done at the junction of red and white, and the red swelling will naturally diminish. In general, for abscesses, if they feel firm upon touch, there is no pus; if they are half soft and half hard, pus is present. Additionally, if the swollen area does not feel hot, then there is no pus; if it feels very hot, pus is likely present and should be urgently drained.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the toxic qi in a sore has congealed and does not erupt, it is advisable to tonify the blood and qi to hasten the formation of pus before using a needle. Once the pus has erupted, it is important to nourish the spleen and stomach to promote muscle generation and close the wound. Generally, when pus and blood from sores have ruptured, the priority should be to greatly replenish blood and qi, and even in the presence of other symptoms, one should focus on this as the primary treatment.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br><strong>Title: Difficult Closure of Wounds</strong></p>
<p>For long-term untreated abscesses that do not close, with white tissue and little pus, this indicates both qi and blood deficiency, leading to cold and stagnation at the wound site. Every day, use a handful of mugwort leaves to brew soup, wash the wound with care to avoid wind and heat, and use incense smoke for fumigation, then apply a miraculous ointment to the wound. It is essential to adhere to dietary restrictions and manage the condition; otherwise, it will not be effective. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the cold evil has solidified and obstructed the flow of qi and blood, it is advisable to use this method to dispel cold evil and replenish yang qi, which has great efficacy. If the issue arises from qi and blood deficiency that prevents the wound from healing, it is best to nourish the spleen and stomach to generate qi and blood. Master Danxi states that among all channels, only the lesser yang and jueyin are prone to abscess formation, and preventive measures are necessary due to their high qi and low blood levels. With insufficient blood, muscle growth is hindered, and long-standing wounds will inevitably lead to failure to heal. If potent purging and toxic medicines are used to deplete the yin and blood, disaster will follow swiftly.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br><strong>On Using Warm and Cool Medicines to Prevent Secretions and Leaks</strong></p>
<p>Wu said: For all patients with sores, it is essential to dispel their toxins and cleanse the old residues. It is advisable to use the Immortal&#39;s Detox Pill, Six-Flavor Chao&#39;ao Powder, Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction, and Qianjin Loulu Decoction, while also carefully distinguishing between individual strengths and weaknesses for adjustments as needed. Generally, the key to treating sores lies in ensuring that the organs are strong and not obstructed, flowing yet not over-exuding, so that true Qi is not consumed and evils have no place to settle. In case of secretive blockages, the Divine Efficacy Hemp Seed Pill is effective. After a sore has ulcerated, if there remains a feeling of internal heat, one can take the Five-Spice Decoction with added Da Huang and (Shi Bu) Nitrate. When treating sores, warm medicines should first include cassia to promote blood circulation and guide other medicines; cool medicines must use Rehmannia to replenish deficits and enhance Qi, filling the marrow. Recently, the use of Frankincense Powder has been noted; Frankincense detoxifies while Mung beans clear heat, making it truly a good remedy.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> For constipation in the large intestine, it is primarily due to dryness in the blood and is not caused by weakness of the stomach qi, thus the front-line medication is recommended. If due to depletion of essence and blood, use Ba Zhen, Tao Ren, and Ma Ren. If there is fever after an ulcer, and due to qi deficiency, use Si Jun, Huang Qi, and Dang Gui; if due to blood deficiency, use Si Wu, Bai Zhu, and Fu Ling; if both qi and blood are deficient, use Ba Zhen and Huang Qi. If there is constipation with red urine, use Si Wu, Mai Men Dong, and Wu Wei Zi. If ineffective, urgently use Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan or Liujia Wan. If there is injury to the original qi after a bowel movement leading to fever, use Liu Jun and Dang Gui; if due to weak stomach qi leading to fever, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Generally speaking, both urination and defecation are overseen by the liver and kidneys. The classics say: the kidneys govern the five fluids and open the orifices at the two yin. If the bodily fluids are nourishing, bowel movements will be smooth; if bodily fluids are insufficient, it is certainly due to the deficiency of spleen qi, thus one should cultivate and transform the source.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br><strong>Wushi said:</strong> After a boil has burst, the necrotic flesh gradually decreases, and new flesh gradually appears. As time goes on, it builds up into a mound, forming a white membrane of new flesh, at which point nourishing and stabilizing should be practiced to ensure safety. In general, the wound should not be hastily closed; daily, wash away the impurities with pig&#39;s trotter soup and externally apply flesh-growing ointment or miraculous ointment. Once the toxic pus has completely drained, the Sacred Efficacy Powder can be used to close the wound. Furthermore, be cautious about daily activities, regulate diet, and restrain emotions. Otherwise, the symptoms of deficiency may surge, possibly leading to dire consequences, so be prudent!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the necrotic flesh has diminished and new flesh is starting to grow, it should first be slightly red, with a gradually developing white membrane around the edges—this indicates the vital energy from the stomach; use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish and support it. If there is significant redness, it indicates blood deficiency with heat; use the Four Substances Decoction plus ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes to adjust and replenish. If there is redness without membrane formation, it indicates qi deficiency; use the Four Gentlemen Decoction plus angelica and astragalus. If the color is white and lacks vitality, both qi and blood are deficient; use the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction plus ginger and cinnamon; if there is no response, urgently add aconite. Generally, after the boil has ruptured, the necrotic flesh gradually recedes, and new flesh gradually emerges, which signifies that the spleen and stomach qi are robust. Once the impurities have been eliminated, it is advisable to use angelica ointment.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br><strong>Observing and Caring for Illness – Section 35</strong></p>
<p>Wu said: For the condition of abscess and sore, the patient should self-examine. In the beginning, encircle the affected area with ink, and observe the rising and falling, gathering and dispersing; check the amount of pus that comes out and the width and narrowness of the flesh that grows. Monitor the quality of food and drink, and be mindful of any secretions from the organs. Prevent excessive opening of the wound. It is essential to avoid anger, regulate labor, nourish the vital energy, and maintain careful observation; negligence is not acceptable! </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This echoes what Master Danxi said regarding abscesses: one should first support the stomach to strengthen the energy, making the foundation solid. Master Dongyuan taught people to have a balanced diet and a regular lifestyle. The &quot;Suwen&quot; reiterates this, so one must be cautious! In general, diarrhea easily depletes vital energy; if swelling and sores affect it, pus cannot form; if ulcers affect it, flesh cannot grow. Patients should be vigilant! </p>

<p><strong>Healing with Aromatic Medicines – Section 36</strong></p>
<p>Wu said: Qi and blood flow with fragrance and stagnate with foul odors. Generally, sores and abscesses often stem from a failure of the protective qi to circulate, becoming stagnant in the flesh, which then coalesces into pus. The fragrance promotes the circulation of qi and blood; therefore, one should frequently take soups with five spices and honeysuckle, and Jinfen powder. Sores are originally foul and filthy; if they are met with a bad smell, they worsen. If poison enters the stomach, it leads to cough and rebellion; the ancients utilized this, and it can be deemed reasonable. Additionally, regulate food and drink to be fragrant and delicious to benefit the spleen and nourish the true essence, ensuring that there are no future worries. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> References from earlier discussions are found in sections 18 and 19.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br><strong>Diet and Living Conditions: Cautions, Section 37</strong></p>
<p>Li says: For those suffering from sores, one should avoid wine, fatty meat, roasted foods, pickled products, raw and cold foods, oily dishes, chicken, goose, and fresh fish. In daily life and emotional states, one must be especially cautious. The bedroom should be clean and fragrant to promote smooth circulation of qi and blood. Additionally, one should avoid monks, Daoists, filial children, postpartum women, menstruating women, and pets like chickens, dogs, and cats. If a sore is difficult to hide, it is advisable to use ten dou of mung beans made into a bag placed over the affected area to detoxify and cool the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The earlier discussion emphasizes careful living conditions and simple flavors, as patients who are too active or prefer hot and cold foods might exacerbate their conditions, making recovery more difficult. Therefore, prevention should be prioritized based on the wisdom of the ancients. Mung beans are cold in nature and are effective for conditions like heat and irritations, but if the cause is purely Yang in nature, regular diet is recommended, otherwise, they should not be used.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>The Thirty-Eighth Good Method</p>
<p>Li said: It is often seen that in the world, physicians possess remarkable remedies but keep them secret or alter them to mislead others, which is truly detestable. I ponder the case of Western Huamaifanshi, who, despite steadfastly refusing to share his knowledge, is rightly criticized by gentlemen for his selfishness. In the past, Zhao Gong ordered Ji Xiu to take charge of Longquan and was making haste to arrive. He suffered from nosebleeds, losing several qing daily. At the time, my elder brother taught him to take lotus root juice and earth yellow ointment. Zhao consulted various physicians, who said that this was to be avoided, and he changed doctors repeatedly without effect. My elder brother secretly supplied the previous medicine, and after three days of taking it, Zhao was cured. My brother said: This is indeed the remedy previously offered. Zhao was astonished and said: If it were not for the deceitful calculations of those physicians to confuse me, and I had believed in this remedy earlier, wouldn’t I have endured this affliction for so long! Now, with repeated testing, it is proven time and again that this cannot be replaced.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>If vomiting is caused by heat toxin attacking the heart, use Neituo Powder (also known as Wanjin Powder); if vomiting is due to weak spleen and stomach, use Jiahe Powder; for swollen pain from heat toxin, use Maifanshi Gypsum; for thirst due to yin deficiency, use a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill. These four prescriptions often confuse physicians and may lead them to mistakenly use them, causing deep suffering for patients. Therefore, I present the story of Zhao Gong as an example.</p>
<p>(Note: I believe that prescriptions are imitative, established by imitating the causes of diseases. This does not mean that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; lacks prescriptions; rather, if one insists on using ancient prescriptions for modern ailments, it is akin to dismantling an old house to fit a new one. Can the dimensions and proportions truly be reconciled without the hand of a skilled carpenter? Even if a reconciliation exists, to claim it as an unchanging prescription since ancient times is to invoke the divine techniques of the former kings. Why should one keep such knowledge a secret? I once observed Master Taiwu treating a monk from Yunnan who, while traveling far to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fell ill with homesickness. The master generously provided him with food and medicinal remedies, and additionally gifted him an ounce of gold to aid his return. This is indeed the proper way of our medical practice. Yet today&#39;s physicians may either cling to the past, hoard secrets, or be driven by greed, leading them to violate established principles and ethics abundantly.)<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>Mica Plaster, Section 39</p>
<p>Li said: Mica plaster is wonderfully effective in treating boils and skin abscesses, yet few in the world know of it. There was a patient whose pus did not come to a head; a toxic substance was applied, worsening the situation, and the poison spread to the throat and knees, leading to a state that could not be cured. I used this plaster, and by morning it had opened up completely. Whenever an abscess produces pus, its poison begins to resolve. If there are cases where it does not rupture, this plaster must be applied. Therefore, I record it, hoping that those discerning may choose to modify and combine it to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>[Note: Cases previously mentioned belong to a yang condition, where qi and blood are unharmed; applying the previous plaster will surely result in healing. However, there are also cases belonging to yin conditions where qi and blood are deficient; one must consider the cause and adjust the internal treatment accordingly. Generally, the formation of sores and ulcers arises from the stomach qi not being coordinated; their rupture results from the stomach qi decaying; their healing comes from the nourishment of the stomach qi. I often treat cases where pus first forms by promoting dispersal; if pus is about to form, I promote decay; if pus has formed but not yet ruptured, I promote opening; and if it has already ruptured, I promote healing. Dr. Dong Yuan said: Stomach qi is the source of growth and is fundamental to the human body. Dr. Danxi also remarked that to treat sores, one must aid the stomach to strengthen the qi, solidifying the foundation. Truly insightful!] </p>
<p>Mysterious Plaster, Section 40<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>For the treatment of abscesses, first apply wheatstone plaster. Wait for the root of the sore to gradually shrink, then use the miraculous ointment to close it up. The onset of boils and abscesses can vary in depth, hence the efficacy of closure can be slow or fast. One must not use closing medicines too early, for fear that the toxic heat has not yet dissipated, which could lead to a relapse and cause more serious issues. Although wheatstone plaster is difficult to adapt, the miraculous ointment is also effective.</p>
<p>Li says: Generally, abscesses that are tight, small, and hard are due to being overcome by wind and poison. One should use centipede and scorpion powder mixed at the sore and apply the miraculous ointment. </p>
<p>This situation often arises when wind and cold are stagnated at the sore, not yet transmitted inward. In all injuries, this condition is quite common. The classics say: Wind is good at rapid movement and change, entering the viscera swiftly; life and death hinge on immediate response. One should urgently distinguish between the superficial and the internal, as well as between deficiency and excess, to treat accordingly. If the evil is in the exterior, it causes stiffness in the bones and muscles, chills, and tightness; the pulse will be superficial and taut, indicating the need for Qianghuo and Fangfeng decoction to harmonize and resolve it. If it has penetrated inward, there will be a strong tongue, a sealed mouth, a stiff neck and back, tight and painful muscles, excessive phlegm, fullness in the chest and abdomen, possible constipation or red urination, occasional sweating, and a flooding, rapid, taut pulse, requiring Dahuang and Qionghuo decoction to guide it out. Initial sweating results from wind-heat stagnating inside, thus also needing similar methods for purgation.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>When heat has receded and the organs are harmonized, yet there is still sweating, this indicates exterior deficiency. It is advisable to use Bai Zhu and Fang Feng Decoction to strengthen the exterior. The methods of dispersing, harmonizing, and guiding are used to treat acute conditions when there is no deficiency of qi and blood. If pus and blood stagnate internally and present the previous symptoms, acupuncture is recommended along with an urgent dose of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If there is jaw stiffness and urinary incontinence, this indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood, and similarly, Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Pao Fu Zi should be used. Generally, if this condition is due to excessive loss of pus and blood, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang reinforced with Qiang Huo as its main ingredient. If a person has a history of phlegm and presents with symptoms of wind due to injury, the prescription should include Er Chen Tang, Bai Zhu, Chuan Xiong, Gui, Zhi Zi, Qin, and Lian. For qi deficiency, add Si Jun Zi Tang; for blood deficiency, add Si Wu Tang. If both blood and qi are deficient with severe internal heat causing wind, then Si Wu Tang combined with Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chai Hu, Qin, and Zhi Zi is recommended. If the patient experiences tetanus that unexpectedly recurs after three to five years, or if they have suffered injuries from falls, this is also due to deficiency of qi and phlegm; use Er Chen Tang, Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chuan Xiong, and Gui as the main ingredients.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br><strong>Sore Throat and Tongue Like Fungus</strong></p>
<p>Li states: When there is a case of carbuncle and it does not respond to internal remedies, or if the internal poison is not expelled, it can lead to sores in the throat, mouth, and tongue. In severe cases, red and black fungus may develop, harming the person rapidly. It should be treated with amber and rhino horn ointment. There has been a case where previous treatments proved ineffective, but using this remedy for just one day achieved relief. </p>
<p>[Note: The previous evidence often stems from excessive indulgence in wine and lust, depleting kidney water, leading to virtual fire inflaming upward, or the five types of sores consuming vital energy, resulting in virtual fire attacking upward. The treatment should nourish the source of transformation. It is crucial to avoid substances like huanglian (coptis) and zhi mu (anemarrhena), as they may further damage the stomach qi.]<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br><strong>Substitute Needle Powder - Chapter 43</strong></p>
<p>Zeng said: When boils and sores become filled with pus, applying the Substitute Needle Powder causes the wound to open on its own. The ancients said: Boils can be lethal. If the medicinal needle fits the condition, one lives; if it does not fit, one dies. How careless! </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In cases of sores, if toxic qi has already coagulated, causing swelling and redness to become intense, and the flesh in the center dies and turns dark, one should internally use medicines to clear heat and strengthen the spleen, and externally apply black gold ointment. Gradually, the dark area will lower and the red area will rise. Within six or seven days, a crack will appear where the red and dark meet, resembling a cut, and the dark will gradually rupture. It is best if this is done without feeling pain or seeing fresh blood. If pus has not yet flowed freely, use a needle to draw it from the lines; if pus has begun to flow, but swelling and pain persist, there may be internal sinew barriers, and a needle should be used to draw it out. If the vital energy is weak and one mistakenly takes a harmful remedy, resulting in a lack of pain at the affected site or dead flesh that does not rupture, one must urgently warm and nourish the spleen and stomach, as there may still be a chance to regenerate. Following this, pure nourishment of the spleen and stomach should be done to help consolidate. If one recklessly uses needles and knives, removing flesh and causing bleeding, it disperses the yang with the yin, hastening danger. If the pus ruptures but pain persists without healing, with a pulse that is surging, slippery, and greatly dispersed, it indicates a deficiency of true qi with the presence of邪气, making it difficult to treat; if the pulse is weak, thin, and slow, it indicates a deficiency of邪气 and the recovery of true qi, making it easier to treat.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br><strong>Fourth Injury</strong></p>
<p>Li states: For boils and carbuncles, one may use ointments with poisonous herbs, or open and cut with a needle or knife. If the wound edges don&#39;t fit together, do not use strong astringent medicines. Instead, it is advisable to wash with pig&#39;s hoof soup or northern mugwort soup intermittently, apply the miraculous ointment, and take internal tonics like the Ten Xuan Powder or Huang Qi Pills. [Note: According to the classics, the spleen governs the muscles; when the spleen is strong, the flesh will regenerate on its own. However, if the condition is severe, it is advisable to use the aforementioned medicines to eliminate the poison. As the poison diminishes, it is appropriate to use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen.]<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br><strong>On Cold and Heat with Excessive Sweating, Prescription 45</strong></p>
<p>Li states: There are a few cases of back abscesses, sometimes starting with cold then heating, or vice versa, occurring on consecutive or alternate days, always leading to vomiting phlegm followed by profuse sweating, treated with Chai Hu and Heng Shan, but with no effect. I believe this results from improper spleen qi, which is also influenced by cold pathogens and excessive phlegm, thus I first used Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San, followed by Pai Nong Nei Bu San and Mu Xiang Tang; recovery was achieved in three months. [Note: If the external pathogen has been expelled yet symptoms persist, one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang to tonify the spleen and stomach. Generally, if there is stomach qi deficiency causing vomiting, warmth is preferred; if toxins attack internally causing vomiting, cold is preferred. Treatment must be accurately discerned!]</p>

<p><strong>On Food Poisoning Leading to Fever, Prescription 46</strong></p>
<p>Li argues: In cases of carbuncles, one should avoid food items such as beef, mutton, chicken, goose, shrimp, fish, wine, and baked goods, as consuming them will surely induce fever, and it is advisable to take Zhi Zi Huang Qi Tang. Generally, when the organs have been relieved and the sores have ruptured, and qi and blood are already deficient, care and recuperation are paramount. If one takes cooling medications during fever, disaster is inevitable. [Note: If fever arises from dietary harm to the spleen and stomach, use Liu Jun, Shun Qu, and Shan Zha; if there is a deficiency of yin blood causing fever, use Si Wu, Ren, Zhu, and Huang Qi; if there is a significant discharge of pus and blood leading to fever, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. Dong Yuan states: The stomach is the foundation of the five organs. If the stomach qi is damaged, all organs are depleted, leading to numerous ills; caution is essential!]<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br><strong>On Thirst and Supplementing Vital Energy, Chapter 47</strong></p>
<p>The Wu family states: When carbuncles and sores cause high fever and intense thirst, it indicates a strong presence of toxic energy. Promptly use the Immortal&#39;s Poison-Driving Pill to expel the toxins, then follow up with Qing Dan Soup, Wan Jin Powder, Five-Spice Forsythia Soup, Liu Wei Che&#39;ao Powder, or Qian Jin Loulu Soup as options. If thirst persists, use secret transmission Gold Powder Powder, Ginseng and Astragalus Powder, or similar formulas to replenish fluids and invigorate blood energy, which will alleviate the thirst.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the pulse is deep and firm with constipation, the aforementioned medicines should be used to expel the accumulated toxins. If there is fever and thirst, but food intake and bowel movements are regular, it indicates excess heat in the stomach channel; use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Soup to clear the stomach heat and generate fluids. If there is fever and thirst, but decreased appetite and loose stools, it indicates deficiency heat in the stomach channel; use Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Soup to replenish stomach energy and generate fluids. If fever is accompanied by chills, or there is internal heat with afternoon fever and dry mouth, indicating insufficient qi and blood, use Eight Treasures, Wheat Husk, and Five Flavors to nourish the liver and spleen, and generate vital essence and blood.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br><strong>On the Heat of Thirst After the Recovery from Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Li states: After the healing of an abscess, if one suddenly experiences thirst without relief, this occurs in eighteen or nineteen out of twenty cases. If someone first experiences thirst and then develops an abscess, it is particularly difficult to treat. One should urgently use the modified Eight-flavor Pill, which can prevent the previous affliction. If taken over a long period, one will never feel thirsty again and will not display symptoms of abscesses; both the vital energy and blood will be robust—this is indeed a genuine sacred remedy!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The previous symptoms are due to a depletion of kidney water, with deficient fire rising, resulting in dry mouth and thirst, an insatiable desire for water, or cracked lips, frequent urination, or phlegm obstructing upward, causing agitation and unease. Thirst may appear one to three years prior, or there may be sores in the mouth and on the tongue, heat in both feet, and phlegm obstruction. Even three to four years post-abscess healing, dry mouth and thirst may recur with frequent urination; in this case, urgent use of the previous medicine is often required to prevent recurrence. If one can discern the cause in advance and take the specified pills, this affliction can be avoided. If there are also coldness in the hands and feet, true yang is deficient; the Eight-flavor Pill should be used. Generally, if after an abscess there is a recognized deficiency of kidney water, use the modified Eight-flavor Pill; if there is weakness of middle qi, use the Restore Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction; if there is weakness of both qi and blood, use the Ten-Ingredient Great Tonifying Decoction; if there is deficient cold of yang qi, add ginger and cinnamon; if it does not respond, use the Eight-flavor Pill.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>After a carbuncle has settled or during its unsettled phase, if the mouth and tongue are dry and yellow like the inner gold of a chicken, this indicates that kidney water is exhausted and heart fire is raging upward; this condition is the most severe. The ancients said: &quot;When the Jade Lake is drained, the seven dynasties perish.&quot; If one mistakenly administers elixirs or pills, disaster is at hand. It is urgent to use the modified Eight Flavor Pill, mulberry twig decoction, and Schisandra berry soup to nourish and replenish.</p>
<p>(Note: If previous symptoms arise from careless sexual activity, leading to the depletion of true yin and the ascent of empty fire, one may also be afflicted by this condition. If fever and thirst occur, or if sores appear on the mouth and tongue, or if there is frequent urination, or pain in the genitals, the aforementioned remedies should also be used. The mulberry twig helps replenish blood and qi, generates bodily fluids, lightens the body, clears the eyes, and is an excellent remedy for nourishing the lungs and kidneys. The Schisandra berry soup is a compound of Six-to-One powder and Shengmai powder, a good remedy for nourishing the source of transformation. If kidney water is already dried up, with empty fire raging upward and the mouth dry and thirsty, one must add the modified Eight Flavor Pill. For detailed usage of the medication, see the key in the appendix.)<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>Li said: The heat from a carbuncle never arises without deficiency of the kidneys; one must take the modified Eight Ingredients Pill at the fifth watch. </p>
<p>[Note: Carbuncles are all caused by damp-heat in the kidney meridian and the upward burning of deficient fire, leading to severe symptoms. If not for the modified Eight Ingredients Pill, which nourishes kidney water to control heart fire, and replenishes middle qi to generate transformation, the desire for recovery would be difficult to achieve. Qi Yuanzi said: In severe cold with no heat, this indicates a lack of fire, and one should support the heart; in severe heat with no cold, this indicates a lack of water, and one should nourish the kidneys. When there is no cold, it points to insufficient water; when there is no heat, it points to insufficient fire. If the heat does not last long, it reflects the deficiency of the heart; if the cold does not last long, it reflects the lack of water. I believe that for a lack of fire, the Eight Ingredients Pill should be used to nourish the heart; for a lack of water, the Six Ingredients Pill should be used to nourish the kidneys.]<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br><strong>On This Treatment for Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Li stated: For the treatment of abscesses, one should take the Ten Whole Great Supplement Decoction daily to nourish Qi and blood, and it is advisable to alternate with the Decocted San (Ten Xuan San) to expel pus while also reinforcing internal recovery. [Note: It has been previously mentioned that ulcers are associated with deficiency of both Qi and blood, thus supplementation is essential. If a patient has swelling and abscesses with weak Qi and blood, it is especially important to provide supplementary treatment in advance; otherwise, despite ulceration, healing will not occur. After a serious illness, if Qi and blood have not yet recovered, this often leads to relapses. If nourishment is not properly provided, it could result in a transformation to more serious conditions. There may be a misunderstanding that the wound poison has recurred, leading to aggressive treatments that may cause a worsening condition; this should be taken as a caution. For further details, see the key points for medication in the appendix.]</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut to Medication</strong></p>
<p>Li stated: For patients with ulcers and abscesses due to kidney deficiency, it is important to take nourishing medicines urgently, though there is fear of error. Medicines such as deer antler and aconite are akin to stoking a fire with firewood, which may worsen the condition. Moreover, general replenishing medicines may also be ineffective. There was a nobleman suffering from ulcers, and none of the medicines were effective. I foolishly suggested he take yam pills at the early dawn, before interactions with food and at a time when the kidney pathways were not yet open. Following this method for three days, his pulse and symptoms stabilized. If the kidney channels are severely cold and stagnant, then deer antler and aconite can be applied. [Note: This method indeed has restorative effects, as discussed in earlier sections.]<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br><strong>Regulating Diet to Harmonize Stomach Qi</strong></p>
<p>It is said: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that for those who are deficient in form, they should be warmed by Qi; for those who are deficient in essence, they should be nourished by flavors. Generally speaking, conditions of sores and carbuncles require the adjustment of the spleen and stomach. The spleen is the officer of storage, and the stomach is the sea of food and grains, responsible for nourishing the surrounding areas. It is necessary to take in food and drink to generate Qi and blood, and the following remedies are recommended: Poria Opening the Stomach Powder, Ginseng Internal Supplement Powder, and Internal Supplement Decocted Ten Herbs.</p>
<p>[Note: The Ginseng Qi Regulating Powder is used because the Qi of the spleen, lungs, and kidneys may become stagnant. This should be used to disperse it. If Qi is deficient and stagnant, it is necessary to use the Nourishing Qi and Enhancing Vitality Decoction for regulation and replenishment. Modern patients often suffer due to injuries to Qi and blood, and treatment should be based on symptoms. If the stomach Qi is stagnant, Poria Opening the Stomach Decoction should be used. If stomach Qi is weak, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If stomach Qi sinks, use the Supplementing the Middle and Enhancing Qi Decoction. If spleen Qi is weak, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction. If spleen Qi is stagnant, use the Returning Spleen Decoction.]</p>
<p>Li said: If the stomach Qi is weak and does not accept food, it is suitable to take the Jiahe Powder, adding two Qian each of ginseng, clove, fragrant sandalwood, and white cardamom for every five Liang. There was a noble who suffered from carbuncles; due to an improper order of medication, the spleen became weak and he could not eat. I intended to use the Jiahe Powder. Someone mentioned the presence of clove and fragrant sandalwood inside, suggesting to take them separately as medicine, but it did not respond. So, I continued with the previous powder, and his appetite returned immediately.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br><strong>Fifty-Fourth Example of Leaking Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The classic states: the sinking pulse is considered leakage, lingering in the flesh’s pores. When the pulse is affected by cold, it sinks and stagnates in the muscles, hence it is said to linger in the flesh’s pores, referred to as cold leakage. One must use Sinking Pulse Powder and Cinnamon and Aconite Pill to warm and tonify.</p>
<p>**[Note] According to sores and ulcers classified as leakage, these arise from insufficient vital energy, with the nutritive energy not following properly, reverting against the flesh’s structure, or being impeded by cold, blocking the blood vessels, which leads to decay over time. When Yang energy becomes deficient and cold, external pathogens take advantage of the weakness and cause sinking, resulting in this condition. </p>
<p>If treated in the initial stage, one should internally use Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica, and Atractylodes to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach, while externally applying mulberry branches and scallions for moxibustion to guide the Yang energy for spontaneous resolution. If it takes too long to form pus, use the aforementioned methods to assist in hastening it. </p>
<p>If pus has formed but does not flow out, burn a few moxa cones directly on it to encourage drainage, and take the Comprehensive Boosting Decoction. The patient should also be careful with daily living and moderate their diet to facilitate recovery. </p>
<p>Should one mistakenly use cold needles for puncturing, it will lead to delayed internal emission of blue pus with a dark external appearance; or if they erroneously use a wound-healing powder to hasten closure, it will instead support the evil and lead to certain failure.**<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br><strong>Technique of the Cicada Needle, No. 55</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Hong treated carbuncles and ulcers by initially using a single pen tube to insert a cicada. The mouth of the tube was directed at the center of the sore, allowing the cicada to suck out the pus and blood, thereby dispersing the poison. If the sore was larger, it was necessary to replace it with three or four cicadas. If the cicada sucked the precise spot, it would surely die. This method was repeatedly tested with consistent results. If the bleeding did not stop, apply mud from lotus stems to the area. If the sore was not clearly defined, applying mud from the edge of a well to the dry parts first would suffice. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once a carbuncle or ulcer has formed, the toxic blood coagulates externally, making this method effective in drawing it out, but it only addresses the surface issue. It is also essential to assess whether the illness is superficial or deep, and to consider the condition of the vital energy when administering medication, as this integrates both internal and external treatments, leading to a complete cure.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Ulcers in Key Areas</strong></p>
<p>When treating a sore or ulcer, one must examine the meridians to ascertain the symptoms and the nature of the condition, whether it is deficient or excessive. One should not be fixated on treating internal heat and toxins solely with cold and cooling remedies, as this can deplete the spleen and stomach&#39;s qi and blood, leading to mistakes. If there is swelling, elevation, and pain, it indicates a presence of pathogenic factors; one should first use the &quot;Divine Immortal&#39;s Reviving Decoction,&quot; followed by the &quot;Tuo Li Dispersing and Detoxifying Powder.&quot; For mild swelling and slight pain, it suggests a deficiency of true qi; in this case, use the &quot;Tuo Li Powder.&quot; If there is no response, add ginger and cinnamon. If there is no suppuration or necrosis, it suggests yang deficiency; use &quot;Four Gentlemen Decoction&quot; with Astragalus and cinnamon. If pus is present but pain recurs, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood; use &quot;Eight Treasure Powder.&quot; If the wound does not generate flesh and does not close up, it points to spleen qi deficiency; treat with &quot;Four Gentlemen Decoction,&quot; adding peony and nutmeg. Additionally, treatment should be based on timing and specific symptoms; if there is swelling and pain, agitation and fever, cold drinks leading to constipation, and a rapid, strong pulse, it indicates five excesses. Even in extreme cold, one must use very bitter and cold remedies to drain the yang to save the yin.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>If the pulse is thin and the skin is cold, with diarrhea, abdominal rumbling, lack of appetite, vomiting, and cold extremities, this is classified as the Five Deficiencies. Even in the height of summer, it is essential to use a strong, warming remedy to disperse the cold and restore the yang. If one adheres to the usual methods, it would be a mistake.</p>
<p>When a sore or ulcer causes vomiting, resembling severe heat and pain due to excess evil qi, one should use the Xianfang Huoming Decoction to resolve it. If there is pus and pain due to the stomach qi being deficient, the Tori Xiaodu San should be used. If there is swelling and pain from mature pus, indicating deficiency of qi and blood, the Tori San can be applied, or acupuncture can be used to relieve it. If there is pain and constipation, indicating heat accumulation internally, the Nei Shu Huanglian Decoction should be utilized to induce it. For cold medicines harming the stomach, the Tori Jianzhong Decoction is appropriate. For reduced appetite and stomach coldness, the Tori Yizhong Decoction is recommended. For middle deficiency with excess cold, the Tori Wenzhong Decoction should be prescribed. If the liver’s wood overacts on the spleen’s earth, use the Tori Yiqing Decoction. For stagnation of phlegm in the stomach area, the Tori Qingzhong Decoction can be used. If the spleen is deficient due to its own illness, apply the Tori Yihuang San. If there is stagnation harming the spleen, use the Tori Yueju Decoction.</p>
<p>Regarding a sore or ulcer treated with external medicines, if there is swelling, pain, and thirst, indicating pure yang, it is appropriate to take the Jiyin Dan internally and apply the Yeyang San externally.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>If it appears swollen but is not, seems painful but isn&#39;t, or seems to be festering but isn&#39;t, it belongs to a state of half-yin and half-yang.

If there is slight swelling and slight pain, or a dark color without pain, or hardness without festering, this indicates a pure-yin condition. It should be treated with an internal decoction of Returning Yang Soup and an external application of Restraining Yin Powder.</p>
<p>For a sore or ulcer that is painful, if there is constipation, use the Internal Soothe Huanglian Decoction; if there is intense heat and toxicity, use the Immortal Formula for Life; if there is stagnant blood, use the Frankincense Pain-Relieving Powder; if it is festering and painful, use the Tuo Li Disinfecting Powder. For painful swelling with pus, treat it with a needle. If it has festered and is painful, then nourish it. For pain from qi deficiency, use the Four Gentlemen, Gui, and Qi formulas. For pain from blood deficiency, use the Four Substances, Shen, and Qi formulas. For pain due to kidney deficiency, use the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. For dryness and thirst, or frequent urination, adjust with the Eight Flavor Pill.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>When there is a sore with gas escaping and sinking in, it may be due to mistakenly taking harsh medicine, or excessive pus and blood loss, or from vomiting and diarrhea due to overexertion, or from improper sexual activity.

<p>After a sore ulcerates, if there is fever and irritability, and if the fever prevents sleep, this indicates blood deficiency, treat with Shengyu Decoction; if there is persistent sweating, this indicates qi deficiency, treat with Four Gentlemen Decoction plus Astragalus and Schisandra; if there is fever and irritability, muscles twitch and tendons are taut, indicating deficiency of both qi and blood, treat with Eight Precious Decoction; if there is extreme thirst with a red face and a floating large pulse, indicating yin deficiency leading to heat, treat with Angelica Blood Supplement Decoction; if there is slight limb warmth, irritability, a red face, and a sinking and weak pulse, indicating excessive yin leading to irritability, treat with Four Gentlemen, Ginger, and Aconite.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br>When there is a sore with constipation, if the patient feels thirsty and drinks cold water, with a pulse that is strong and rapid, this indicates excess heat; internal cooling with Huanglian Decoction is recommended. If there is dryness in the mouth and drinking soup, with a pulse that is floating, large, and weak, this indicates deficiency of qi; the modified Eight Treasures Decoction should be used. If the appetite is good but the abdomen does not swell, this indicates internal heat dissipating; it should not be purged. If there is abdominal distension and no relief, this is due to dry rectum, and pig bile should be used to guide it. If purging mistakenly is used, it could injure the original qi and hinder recovery.</p>
<p>For a sore with diarrhea, if caused by cold harming the spleen, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with sand ginger. If spleen qi is weak, send it with the Six Gentlemen Decoction and Ershen Pill. If the spleen is weak and sagging, Tonify the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction with Ershen Pill is appropriate. If the kidney fire is weak, use Eight Flavor Pill decocted with Four Shen Pill. If the kidney is weak and unstable, use Jiangfu Decoction with evodia and five flavors. For spleen and kidney cold deficiency, use Shenfu Decoction with Four Shen Pill. If the pulse is deep and thin, and food cannot be ingested, use Jiangfu Decoction; many recover from this.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br>A sore accompanied by frequent urination, or pain in the perineum, indicates a deficiency in the kidney&#39;s yang energy, which cannot properly transform the negative condition. Use the modified Eight Flavor Pill to replenish the yin. For cold in the legs, use the Eight Flavor Pill to replenish the yang. If urination is frequent and yellow, use the Four Substance Decoction with ginseng, atractylodes, barley, and schisandra to nourish the lungs and kidneys. If urination is short and yellow, supplement with the Middle-Boosting Qi Decoction adding yam, barley, and schisandra to strengthen the kidneys. If there is heat stagnating in the bladder leading to difficulty urinating, use the Five Lin Powder to clear heat. If the spleen and lung&#39;s qi is dry and unable to transform, use Huangqin Qingsuan Decoction to nourish the yin. If the bladder is yin deficient and unable to generate warmth, consider the Nourishing Kidney Pill; if the bladder&#39;s yang is deficient and cannot transform fluids, consider the Kidney Qi Pill. For elderly men with impotence due to internal decay, use the modified Eight Flavor Pill adding plantago and achyranthes; if there is no response, add aconite. If there is pain during urination and defecation, the more pain there is, the more frequent urination occurs, leading to increased pain—previous medicines may be augmented with aconite for better results.

For severe swelling and pain, indicating accumulated heat and toxins, use the Xian Fang Huo Ming drink. For diffuse swelling with slight pain, indicating deficiency and stagnation of qi and blood, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction. If thirst arises due to stomach fire consuming fluids, use the bamboo leaf and astragalus decoction. If thirst arises from a deficiency of stomach qi that cannot produce fluids, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction. If thirst arises from damage to stomach qi, leading to the loss of bodily fluids, use the Seven Flavor Atractylodes powder. If thirst arises from depleted kidney water, or dryness of the mouth and tongue, use the modified Eight Flavor Pill. Sometimes, thirst may first appear with dry mouth, frequent urination, followed by the occurrence of sores; or thirst may arise after the sores have healed. If the tongue is yellow, dry, and hard, and there is frequent urination with sores developing, this is particularly concerning. If one can discern the cause in advance, taking the modified Eight Flavor Pill or Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction to nourish the source of digestion can help avoid such afflictions. </p>

<p>For sores and ulcers needing a needle, we must distinguish between fresh and mature, shallow and deep. If gentle pressure causes pain, the pus is shallow; if firm pressure causes pain, the pus is deep. If pressing does not cause it to rise again, the pus is not yet formed; if pressing causes it to rise immediately, the pus is already formed.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>If pus forms and is immediately punctured, it simply drains the vital energy and blood, making the pus even harder to resolve; if the pus is ripe but not punctured, the decay deepens and the wound mouth is difficult to close. If the wound is deep but the puncture is shallow, the internal pus does not come out, while external blood leaks; if the wound is shallow but the puncture is deep, although the internal pus may flow out, it injures the healthy flesh. When the original vital energy is weak, replenishing must come before puncturing, without exception. If pus comes out but there is pain or irritability with nausea and vomiting, it is due to the depletion of blood and energy, requiring urgent replenishment. The mention of not considering the vital energy pertains to the fact that the affected area is already decaying.</p>
<p>For a wound or ulcer where muscle does not grow: if it is red and does not grow, it is due to blood heat; use Four Substance Decoction with the addition of peony root. If there is internal heat and blood deficiency, use Four Gentlemen Decoction with added angelica, earth, and peony root. If the pus is clear and watery, both vital energy and blood are deficient; use Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction. If there is little food intake and fatigue, it indicates spleen energy deficiency; use the Decoction for Augmenting Energy. If there is irritability and thirst, living normally, it indicates stomach fire; use Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction. If there is irritability and thirst, especially in the afternoon heat, it indicates kidney deficiency; use Modified Eight Flavor Pill.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br><strong>On Osteomyelitis</strong></p>
<p>Osteomyelitis arises when an ulcer has festered for a long time, failing to nourish the affected area with qi and blood.

Use the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang&quot; (Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction) to strengthen the foundation. </p>
<p>If there is heat from yin fire, add &quot;Liu Wei Di Huang Wan&quot; (Six-Flavor Rehmanniacapsule) to strengthen the water element and calm the yang. If there is deficiency and coldness of yang qi, use &quot;Ba Wei Wan&quot; (Eight-Flavor Pill) to nourish the source of fire and dispel the yin obstruction. Externally, apply a paste of aconite and scallion to dispel the cold evil and supplement the nourishing qi; thus, the bones will detach and the sores will heal naturally.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Medical Compendium: Volume 362</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Department of Surgery: Abscesses and Toxic Sores</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan]<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Carbuncles and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>A carbuncle represents stagnation and belongs to the Yang organ systems; its toxins manifest externally, appearing abruptly and affecting the surface, without injuring muscles or bones. An abscess signifies depletion and pertains to the Yin organ systems; its toxins strike internally, emerging slowly and delving deeply, damaging muscles and eroding bones. Generally, in young individuals, the vigor of qi and blood overcomes toxins, leading to favorable outcomes. In the elderly, overpowering toxins combined with weak qi and blood create danger. </p>
<p>In cases where internal dietary factors accumulate toxins, the text states: &#39;Rich and fatty foods lead to major carbuncles.&#39; When the nourishing qi does not flow properly, it rejoices against the flesh and skin. The nourishing qi refers to the stomach qi; when the stomach is harmonious, the defensive and nourishing energies thrive and nourish the skin. Rich foods and excessive heating of the body can give rise to internal heat, accumulating dampness and heat, exhausting kidney water, and intensifying Yin fire. Consequently, the eight vessels boil and stagnate, impeding the ascent of refined essences from food, which then stagnates in the flesh and leads to carbuncles.</p>
<p>In cases of external pathogen invasion from wind, cold, and dampness causing toxins, the text states: &#39;The dampness of the earth harms the skin and flesh.&#39; It also mentions: &#39;All abscesses, swellings, muscle constrictions, and bone pains arise from cold and the transformation of the eight winds.&#39; When external factors of wind and dampness invade over time, they transform into heat. This heat may migrate from the bladder to the small intestine, and then from the small intestine to the gallbladder. Wind tends to urge upwards, creating lesions that are raised, red, and painful; smaller ones are boils, while larger ones are carbuncles, not like the internal conditions of abscesses.</p>
<p>Additionally, there can be cases resulting from stagnant heart qi due to overeating or fasting, excessive labor, or sexual indulgence, leading to depletion of water and flames. Phlegm and qi stagnate, causing lesions. The so-called fire of the heart can give rise to sores and ulcers; all pains and itching related to sores and ulcers are attributed to heart fire.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>Due to the presence of fire, there are manifestations of the illness: the sores may be small and intense, with some causing pain without significant swelling, while others may be swollen without much pain. Nevertheless, the illness is generally attributed to damp-heat. Danxi states: In the human body, blood flows within the vessels, while qi flows outside the vessels. When cold and dampness impede, the flow becomes stagnant and slow; when fire and heat hinder, it boils over and flows rapidly. Qi may become obstructed, and body fluids may turn into phlegm or drink, gradually infiltrating the vessels, causing blood to become turbid, leading to stagnation of yin within yang, resulting in abscesses. Conversely, if blood becomes obstructed, it may overflow or congeal, and if this continues for a long time, it spills out of the vessels, causing disorder in qi, leading to stagnation of yang within yin, resulting in festering sores. Yang qi is formless, while yin blood has substance; thus, it is essential for damp-heat to cause blood to weep before abscesses or sores develop. Therefore, the &quot;Jufang&quot; states: Both abscesses and sores arise from excessive heat in the blood.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br>It is also said: When two forms of heat clash, heat transforms into pus. Heat cannot corrupt and break down muscle into pus without the presence of moisture. For example, in summer, various things do not spoil; decay occurs primarily when the humid heat of autumn prevails, and this principle is quite clear. </p>
<p>There are sores that are large yet heal, and others as small as a bean that lead to death. </p>
<p>For an external outbreak (yang), it starts with thin skin, generating heat, appearing red, swelling, and painful; after it breaks, the flesh appears red and lively, which is easy to treat when there is good health and appetite. One may experience fever and constipation, with a rapid and strong pulse, indicating pure yang, which is easier to heal.</p>
<p>For an internal outbreak (yin), it begins with thick skin, not generating heat, appearing dark and slightly swollen and hard, similar to the skin on a cow’s neck, not painful, soft on the inside, not producing pus, and only slightly open upon rupture; after it breaks, the flesh appears purple-black. This indicates an internal issue; before it ruptures, the internal organs may already be damaged. Additionally, there will be fatigue, less appetite, no fever, and a soft, weak pulse, indicating pure yin, which is hard to treat.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>There are conditions that are half Yin and half Yang, where one may feel swollen but not really swollen, where pain may seem present but isn&#39;t truly painful, where redness appears but isn&#39;t really red, and where there seems to be pus but isn&#39;t actually there. The pulse is rapid and weak, resembling a state with more Yang than Yin; using medicine to support the interior, those with excessive Yang will survive. Conversely, if there is more Yin and less Yang, using a medicine to support as well will not help, and one must rely on Yin will lead to death. Among these, the crucial life-and-death principle particularly lies in engaging with heat and the absence of heat. In essence, Yang patterns with heat facilitate the circulation of Qi and blood, promoting the growth of flesh; while Yin patterns without heat lead to stagnation of Qi and blood, preventing them from gathering. When heat is present, it is imperative not to reduce the heat, but instead to use warming medicine to clear and drain. Minor boils and toxins, even without heat, are not detrimental. </p>
<p>Although boils and abscesses primarily manifest in one meridian, they may also involve two, often accompanied by symptoms of wind, dampness, phlegm, Qi, blood, or Yin deficiency. Generally, when there are symptoms of wind, food stagnation, and both, one uses the core formula of Jin Zhengqi San, adding Chuanxiong and Muxiang. If wind predominates with itching, one adds wind-dispersing medicine; if Qi predominates with pain, one adds Qi-regulating medicine; if food stagnation triggers alternating cold and heat, one adds food-dissolving medicine; if dampness predominates with swelling, one adds damp-draining medicine. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are classifications for sores: heat sores are painful, empty sores are pale white, and wind-cold sores have white edges. According to ancient methods based on the four external influences, one can simply use a combination of Dahuang, both cooked and raw, with Licorice, grinding them into a powder and taking a spoonful with liquor on an empty stomach for its purgative effects; considering internal causes stemming from emotional disturbances, one could use Yuan Zhi (Polygala) ground into powder, mixed with two qian of liquor, and after clarification, take it while applying the residue to the affected area; also employing the method of using Jinshi (gold and stone) combustion to counteract labor, through Guolao Gao (Old Man&#39;s Ointment). For all hot toxins, one can use Sophora flower combined with liquor; substances like gold and stone when toxic may be as hard as stone and painless, thus it is advisable to use a decoction of Licorice and black beans to alleviate them.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br>Weakness and emaciation, the situation of nourishment and protection being in disarray, the afflicted area feels heavy as if bearing a stone. However, due to the presence of bone steaming heat, treatment should be nourishing, and therefore it is inappropriate to use pungent and drying medicines like Sai Ming Dan or to excessively use fire-reducing and spleen-obstructing medicines. Only Shenqi Wan and Toli San are quite suitable. Moreover, ancient texts state that toxic medicines aggravate severe boils and abscesses.</p>
<p>Areas closer to the bones are often cold; over time, blood may transform into worms, leading to more itching than pain. Areas closer to deficiency tend to be hot; over time, Qi may leak, causing more pain than itching.</p>
<p>The hair of the head pertains to the kidney channel and the foot Taiyang meridian; the sideburns relate to the hand and foot Shaoyang meridians; the eyebrows relate to both hand and foot Taiyang and Shaoyang meridians; beard and jaw hair correspond to the foot Yangming meridian; cheek hair pertains to the hand Yangming meridian; back hair is associated with the governing vessel while the rest belongs to the foot Taiyang meridian; underarm hair corresponds to the hand Taiyang meridian; breast hair relates to both the internal Yangming and external Shaoyang meridians; the nipples correspond to the foot Jueyin meridian; kidney abscesses relate to the foot Taiyang meridian; external kidney abscesses relate to the foot Jueyin meridian; leg hair corresponds to both external and internal three Yang and three Yin meridians; throat and belly button abscesses involve the conception vessel and foot Yangming meridian; hair in the groin, the governing, chong, and conception vessels, and tumorous issues from riding relate to the foot Jueyin meridian; internal boils: lung abscesses relate to the hand Taiyin meridian; intestinal abscesses involve hand Taiyang and Yangming meridians; stomach abscesses correspond to the foot Yangming meridian. If Shaoyang and Shaoyin are energetic with little blood, while Jueyin and Taiyang are abundant in blood with little energy, balancing the flesh becomes difficult. Only the hand and foot Yangming channels are abundant in both Qi and blood. When prescribing according to the channels, one must not violate the prohibitions of the channels or the diseases, leading to erroneous purging or sweating. Furthermore, ulcers pertaining to the kidney channel are the most severe, followed by those of the spleen and lung channels, with others being less serious. The brain is where all Yang channels converge, the throat connects to food intake, and the kidney is tied to the root of life, all being precarious areas where one should not apply too much moxibustion.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>It is misguided to be limited by superficial symptoms and ignore the meridians. The poison originates from external factors; if there are no obstructions to urination internally and the six meridians present with patterns, although there is significant swelling and pain, eating and drinking are normal, and the pulse is floating and rapid, the evil is at the surface. Thus, one should administer a mild sweating treatment to disperse it from the surface. </p>
<p>If the symptoms manifest in the head, back, and neck, use Huanglian Xiaodu San; if in the buttocks, use Qianghuo Decoction; for the arms, use Baizhi Shengma Decoction; for the breast and chest, use Shengma Decoction; for both sides of the ribs, use Shiwai Zhonghe Decoction; for the outer thigh, use a wine decoction; and for the inner thigh near the knee, use Qi Chai Decoction. </p>
<p>Commonly used remedies include Baidu San and Jiuwu Qianghuo Decoction, which are warm and spicy. For spontaneous sweating and swelling in the hands and feet, leading to a flow of fluid to the limbs, use Fuzi Liu Wutang, which is warm and spicy. If there&#39;s fever, use Shiliu Wei Liqi Yin or Saiming Dan. During hot months, employ a repeated decoction, while in colder months, use Shixuan San or possibly Jincheng Zhengqi San. </p>
<p>Danxi treats cases with prominent superficial pulses; in winter, if there is red swelling on the back and no pain in the scapula, use a mixture of Guizhi and Mabi Decoction with additions of Shengfu, Jiu Bai, (Herb Le) Loranthus Pollen, Licorice nodes, Qianghuo, Qingpi, Ren Shen, Huangqin, and Banxia. Brew and take this for six doses to achieve recovery, as this follows the proper internal treatment method. Some argue that if a patient with sores experiences pain, they should not sweat; sweating would induce a rash, indicating the evil is not at the surface, and this would be a mistake.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br>If there is internal injury due to food accumulation and toxicity, accompanied by unusual swelling and pain, with no external manifestations of the six channels, and internal obstruction of bowel and urination, along with thirst and agitation, and a deep and solid pulse, it indicates that the evil is internal. Thus, one should urgently use cold and cool methods to attack internally, utilizing Huang Lian Decoction, Xie Xin Decoction, Huo Ming Decoction, and Si Shun Qing Liang Decoction. In mild cases, clear heat and detoxify with Qing Re Xiao Du Decoction plus Zi Cao, or disperse with Qing Xin San.</p>
<p>When there is internal accumulation of heat toxins and external invasion of pathogens, one should use methods to release the exterior and attack internally, such as using Wu Xiang Lian Qiao Decoction or Feng Feng Tong Sheng San. In cases of severe toxicity, employ Detoxifying Decoction and Shen Xiong Pill; if there is excessive dampness, use Zhu Shi Dan.</p>
<p>If toxicity arises from internal injuries and deficiency due to sexual exhaustion, and is exacerbated by repressed anger, though there are swelling and pain, if there are no external signs related to the six channels and no obstruction of bowel and urination, it indicates that the evil is in the channels. Therefore, one should not recklessly use sweating or purging treatments, but should instead focus on tonifying the body&#39;s qi, regulating the channels, harmonizing the nutritive and defensive qi, or specifically tonifying the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a><br>The remedy for those who are filled with anger involves a combination of sixteen flavors of flowing qi drinks. For those suffering from internal deficiency, one should use the Tuo Li Xiao Du San, Nei Tuo Fu Jian San, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. In ancient times, the treatment for abscesses with cold medicines was the standard method; treating sores with hot medicines was an auxiliary approach. This is because the nature of hot medicine promotes circulation, while cold medicine causes dispersal. Sores are tangible entities, and it is not feasible for a hot medicine to merely assist in their treatment. This reflects the principles of internal support and internal dispersal, as well as the contrast between primary treatment and auxiliary treatment.</p>
<p>After an abscess ruptures, there is a significant depletion of qi and blood, raising fears of poison infiltration; thus, the method of Tuo Li cannot be neglected even for a day. Ancient formulas such as Tuo Li San, Tuo Li Qing Zhong Tang, Tuo Li Ding Zhong Tang, Tuo Li He Zhong Tang, Tuo Li Jian Zhong Tang, Tuo Li Yi Qing Tang, and Tuo Li Yi Qi Tang should be selected. By supporting with Tuo Li, qi and blood are strengthened, the spleen and stomach are robust, pus and filth are expelled on their own, toxins are resolved naturally, dead tissue breaks down, new flesh forms, and the wound closes by itself. If one fails to focus on support and mistakenly employs cold or cool treatments, it could aggravate the evil fire, lead to excessive pus and foul smell, and in severe cases, result in a rapid pulse, extreme thirst, true qi deficiency, and death.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br>Danxi said: &quot;When one observes swelling and pain, if the pulse indicates weakness, one should use tonics to achieve full recovery. There is no need to be overly concerned with the innate substance quality or excessive phlegm from ginseng and astragalus. However, if there is heat toxin present at the time of initial rupture, one should increase the dosage of detoxifying and cleansing agents. If there are symptoms like back pain radiating to the shoulders and the membrane has ruptured with penetrating heart distress, one&#39;s condition is critical; therefore, it is essential to protect the heart to prevent toxins from penetrating deeper. If toxic qi ascends and the mind feels heavy, prompting nausea, it is advisable to intermittently take heart-protecting powder to remedy this. If there are signs of exterior evils with a red face and the situation is not yet severe, one may take internal decoctions such as Fu Jian San or Shi Xuan San temporarily. In cases where there are no heat toxins or exterior evils, but foul qi affects one’s condition, leading to weak heat and difficulty sleeping, one should administer Ren Shen Huang Qi Tang; if there is much pus, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping, one should use Sheng Yu Tang; if seen are spleen deficiency and weak qi, preventing nourishment and closure, one should apply Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; if kidney deficiency causes unresolved issues and there are afternoon heat and thirst, one should take Ba Wei Wan or Shen Qi Wan. In urgent situations where there is no time to make pills, one may drink a strong decoction. Prevention and urgent care are both essential. If one focuses solely on superficial treatments using medicines for external applications and muscle regeneration, the closure may happen too quickly, causing toxins to attack internally, or a new abscess could occur nearby, or severe symptoms may suddenly arise after healing, leading to a possible serious outcome. Thus, prioritizing internal treatment over external remedies is important. </p>
<p>Injuries lead to pain, whereas qi damage results in swelling. If pain occurs before the swelling, it indicates blood injury; if the swelling precedes the pain, it indicates qi injury. Both swelling and pain suggest injuries to both qi and blood, which stem from disharmony of the organs and cannot be adjusted by external treatments alone.&quot;<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br>The ancient method of garlic moxibustion and fermented soybean cakes should only be used for external injuries that have become sores. For internal onset, if there is pain, moxibustion should be applied until the pain subsides; if there is no pain, moxibustion should be applied until pain is felt, then stop. Early detection and early moxibustion are preferable. For one or two days, ten moxibustions will yield ten recoveries; for three or four days, ten moxibustions will yield seven recoveries; for five or six days, ten moxibustions will yield four recoveries; after seven days, moxibustion should not be performed. Other methods such as puncturing or topical treatments can be used as appropriate, especially if there is significant toxicity present. </p>
<p>When the toxin of carbuncles or sores has formed, it is advisable to release it to expedite the accumulation of pus. Once pus has formed, its condition should be assessed based on its maturity and depth for needling. If the swelling is high and soft, it arises from the blood vessels; if the swelling is lower and hard, it arises from the tendons; if the color of the meat has not changed, it is attached to the bone. If the area feels hot upon palpation, there is pus; if it does not feel hot, there is no pus. If pressing on it causes pain, it indicates shallow pus; if deep pressing causes pain, it indicates deep pus.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a><br>If pressing a lump causes it to collapse and not rise again, the pus has not yet formed. If it collapses and then rises again, the pus has formed. If it feels soft all over, there is no pus. A painless lump indicates a blood tumor, while a painful lump suggests a qi tumor. If pressing one side feels soft, there is pus present. If pus has formed and a needle is used, the qi and blood will escape, making it difficult for the pus to fully form. If the pus is mature and not needled, the decay will deepen and the wound will be hard to close. If the wound is deep and the needle is shallow, internal pus will not flow out, while external blood will leak; if the wound is shallow and the needle is deep, even if internal pus emerges, the healthy flesh will get hurt. If the vital energy is weak, one must first replenish it before needling the pus; then the symptoms will subside. If the wound is intensely infected and there is darkened flesh inside, one should strengthen the spleen and stomach internally and apply single babaodou ointment externally, allowing the darkened area to gradually lower and the reddened area to gradually rise. Within six to seven days, the red and dark areas will develop cracks resembling knife marks, and the dark flesh will gradually decay. At that point, one should use a fine needle to carefully excise it.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br>If there is pus and flesh has rotted, and swelling and pain persist, there must be tendons or barriers within; it is necessary to draw it out again and urgently tonify the spleen and stomach. For cases without pain, simply using tonifying medicine may help gather the essence. If one carelessly applies needles or knives, causing the flesh to bleed and not stopping, it is immediately critical. The needles should be made of horse bits and iron.</p>
<p>The vital energy and blood of the human body disperse in warmth and coagulate in cold. When exposed to cold and coolness, the pores become blocked, qi condenses, and blood stasis occurs, preventing old flesh from decomposing and new flesh from forming, leading toxins to attack internally, making recovery difficult, and in severe cases, ending in stagnation. It is essential to separate the internal yang and yin with medicine, and to apply external treatments that address both aspects, creating a dual pressure from inside and outside, allowing the medicine&#39;s essence to connect harmoniously. </p>
<p>For pure yang conditions, take Huanglian Decoction or similar cooling and detoxifying drinks internally, and apply Yiyang San externally; for mixed yin and yang conditions, take Tuoli Xiaoduo San internally and apply Yinyang San externally; for pure yin conditions, take Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with ginger and fuzi brewed in wine internally, and apply Yiyin San externally.</p>
<p>Use powdered ash to remove necrotic flesh, and the medicinal thread and three types of pills to drain pus; these methods aim to eliminate decay entirely, without eroding tendons and bones, and should only be used as a last resort.</p>
<p>Abscesses and boils must have some pain, but not excessive pain. Pain before they rupture indicates heat toxin and constipation, so Huanglian Decoction or detoxifying soup should be used internally. For pus-producing pain, it should be drained, and for swollen pus and pain, it should be punctured. If after rupture the pus has come out and pain recurs, it indicates deficiency. For qi deficiency, take Four Gentlemen Decoction with additional danggui and astragalus; for blood deficiency, take Four Substance Decoction with ginseng and astragalus; for both qi and blood deficiency, take Tuoli Yiqi Decoction; for spleen deficiency, take Tuoli Hezhong Decoction; for kidney deficiency, take Shenqi Pills.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br>If one is affected by foul air when using the toilet, add incense, angelica, and peony to the medicine; if pressed by wind and cold, add windbreak and cinnamon to warm and disperse it. If dry, moisten it; if wet, guide it out. If pain is associated with congealed stagnant blood or bad flesh, then incense can be mixed to alleviate the pain. If a wound does not close due to the lack of muscle growth, and muscle growth is hindered by the presence of decayed flesh, and decayed flesh remains because the spleen and stomach are weak. When qi and blood are insufficient, focus on tonifying and supporting, while also using herbs to invigorate blood circulation; thus, muscle that has been poisoned can regenerate, and necrotic flesh will ulcerate naturally, without needing to resort to cutting. Generally, for those with qi deficiency, fatigue, and poor appetite, use the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for those with blood deficiency, hot flashes, and internal heat, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Angelica, Rehmannia, and Peony; if there is thin, watery pus, both qi and blood are deficient, use the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br>Some may feel no pain, some may feel great pain; some may show no redness, or may have internal pus that has not burst, or may have external flesh that does not decay—this indicates a deficiency of vital energy and blood. Use the mulberry branch moxibustion method and the formula &quot;Shiquandabu Decoction&quot; with ginger and cinnamon to strengthen the yang energy, which will then cause the surrounding areas to dissipate and the sore to begin to decay. If there is weakness in the spleen and stomach, with a slow swelling that shows no redness, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with doubled white astragalus. If there is initial swelling and pain, possibly caused by overexertion or sexual activity leading to a darkened color without pain, this is a transformation from yang to yin; urgently use the &quot;Gu Shen Fu Decoction&quot; to remedy it. If there is sporadic deficiency heat in the blood aspect, the meat around the sore will certainly be red, so use Si Wu Decoction with gardenia and forsythia. For the qi aspect with deficient heat causing thirst, use Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction. It is important to know that if the sore is difficult to close, or gradually enlarges or opens up, leading to bleeding, this is dangerous. Generally, people think the swelling marks are halos, but they are not true halos. The halo forms at the edge of the sore, appearing like red veins.<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a><br>Two to three faintings are bearable; four to five are fatal. Wash the medicine to clear the qi and blood. When pus and blood are gathered, it relies on warm vinegar applied to rotten flesh day and night, or on detoxifying powder, meat broth; for cold sores that are white, a decoction of dried mugwort is also good. Plasters that are too hot can quickly shrink small sores and abscesses, as they aim to induce warmth outward. However, if a large poison initially appears, using them can lead to blockage and stagnation, causing significant trouble. After it has ruptured, only white wax ointment, Taiyi ointment, or water powder ointment should be used externally to prevent breaking open from wind or cold. </p>
<p>For women, regulating blood and relieving stagnation is primary. During menstrual blockage or after a rupture when menstrual blood reappears, if the affected area is hard and unbroken, without swelling or pain, it is ominous. Children mainly experience maternal toxins or possibly food-induced heat; hence, the medicine should be slightly cooling. For those who are constitutionally weak or have suffered long-term illnesses, the main treatment should still focus on tonifying and supporting the qi, blood, spleen, and stomach. </p>
<p>When both pulse and signs are hot, detoxify internally before rupture; after it has ruptured, detoxify the residue. When both pulse and signs are weak, detoxify the residue before rupture; after it has ruptured, tonify the interior to treat the sores so that other symptoms naturally subside. Sores are the root, while the disease is the manifestation. If the disease strikes urgently and the vital energy is strong, focus temporarily on treating the manifestation; if the disease is mild and the vital energy is weak, only treat the root. The heart connects to all orifices, and the organs are enveloped in a single membrane; if worry or fright enters the heart, a rupture of this membrane will surely lead to death. It is excellent to frequently add Poria cocos and Polygala root to the medicine.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>Five virtues: The first is tranquility in movement and stillness, understanding the flavors of food and drink; the second is convenience and balance; the third is the dissolution of swelling and the absence of foulness in fresh water; the fourth is mental clarity and articulate speech; the fifth is a harmonious body and spirit. These pertain to symptoms of the organs, with the illness being mild and external influences shallow. If one can exercise caution and moderation, recovery can occur without medication. </p>
<p>The seven vices represent symptoms of deficiency in the five organs, appearing externally to be excessive while being internally insufficient; thus, one should primarily nourish the stomach&#39;s vital energy, as there is much that can be rejuvenated. One should not abandon treatment due to the presence of these vices. Generally, it relates to weakness in the primordial energy, excessive discharge of pus or water, depletion of Qi and blood, improper sweating or purging, exhaustion of nourishment and protection, insufficiency of Qi and blood due to cold and dampness, or the use of harsh agents that harm the stomach&#39;s energy, leading to the True Qi being weak while the evil Qi becomes strong. </p>
<p>Great thirst with fever, or diarrhea and urinary obstruction, indicates an internal indulgence of evil fire, which is one such vice.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br>For sores and swellings with fever, restlessness, or cases of excessive blood loss, or large discharge of pus, or profuse sweating leading to loss of yang, or excessive diarrhea leading to loss of yin, resulting in the depletion of yin blood and a lack of yang, leading to floating conditions in the muscle surface which are not due to fire. If there is fever without sleep, it indicates vacuity heat; use Shengyu Decoction. If sweating does not stop, it indicates qi deficiency; use Dangshen Decoction. If there is fever and restlessness, with muscle twitching and tendon sensitivity, both qi and blood are deficient; use Baoshitang. If there is great thirst with a flushed face, a flooding pulse that is weak, it indicates yang deficiency with heat; use Guiguitang. If there is mild fever with restlessness, a flushed face, and a deep weak pulse, it indicates excessive yin leading to restlessness; use Si Junzi Decoction with added ginger and Fu. </p>
<p>In cases of thirst, do not focus solely on fire. If there is burning pain with fever and difficulty in harmonizing, use Zhuyeshigao Decoction. If there is swelling and pain with fever, and constipation, use Sishun Qingliang Drink. If burning pain is intense, use Huo Ming Decoction. If there is much pus and liquid, use Shengyu Decoction. If the stomach is injured leading to loss of fluids, use Qian&#39;s Baizhu Powder. If kidney water is depleted, use Bawuwei Pill.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>If one first experiences thirst and frequently urinates followed by the onset of sores, they may either develop thirst again after recovery or have a dry, hard yellow tongue. Frequent urination followed by sores is especially harmful, and it is advisable to preemptively take Ba Wei Wan or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to nourish the source of digestion, which can prevent this affliction. Indeed, there is no case of sores that does not arise from kidney deficiency. Avoid using Zhi Mu and Huang Lian, as they harm Yang, leaving no way for Yin energy to arise.</p>
<p>For diarrhea caused by cold damaging the spleen, use Liu Jun Zi Tang with Sha Ren, or Tuo Li Jian Zhong Tang and Tuo Li Wen Zhong Tang. For spleen deficiency and sinking, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang combined with Er Shen Wan. If the Ming Men fire is weak, use Ba Wei Wan with Si Shen Wan. For kidney deficiency and instability, use Gu Jiang Fu Tang with Wu Yu and Wu Wei Zi; for severe abdominal pain, use Fu Zi Li Zhong Tang or Si Ni Tang. In all cases of sores and diarrhea, if there is a weak kidney pulse, it is fatal.</p>
<p>For constipation due to heat toxins entering the organs, along with nausea, bile, and fever with hardness, it is necessary to relieve the blockage. Also, those with hidden heat and stagnant Yang energy, who present with a red face and constipation, indicate excess fire needing to be released through sweating. If there is weakness after sores with blood depletion leading to constipation, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If constipation occurs due to harm from sexual activity, add ginger and Fu Zi to revive Yang energy, and this will naturally lubricate the bowels. For those who can eat but do not feel bloated in the abdomen, one must not use laxatives. If there is abdominal distension and constipation, use the method with pig bile. Take one pig bile, cut off the head, add a little salt and vinegar, insert a goose quill into the bile, and inject it into the intestinal passage; it will soon clear.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>Frequent and painful urination with a reduced amount indicates renal deficiency. When there is discharge of pus and blood, accompanied by severe swelling and pain, and the pus is foul-smelling, it suggests excess stomach fire due to stomach deficiency. For this, use Ren Shen Huang Qi Decoction or Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi. </p>
<p>If eyesight is impaired, with constricted pupils, discolored white part of the eyes, and the pupils looking upwards, it indicates liver and kidney yin deficiency affecting the eyes. For this condition, use Shen Qi Wan or Ba Wu Decoction, both with added fried Shan Zhi and Mai Men Dong, as well as Wu Wei Zi.</p>
<p>For shortness of breath and a tendency to lethargy, it suggests spleen and lung deficiency fire. Use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added ginger and jujube, or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi.</p>
<p>When heart fire overcomes lung metal, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>Yin fire injures the lungs; take Kidney Qi Pills with Schisandra cooked in decoction. For difficulty in the shoulders and back, along with heavy limbs, this is due to deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, along with five disturbances; use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction or the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, both adding Dioscorea, Cornelian cherry, and Schisandra. </p>
<p>If unable to eat, vomiting after taking medicine, or not tasting food, this indicates weak stomach qi, along with six disturbances; use the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added Mu Xiang and Sha Ren, and in severe cases, add Fu Zi. If accompanied by phlegm, use Tuo Li Qing Zhong Decoction; if accompanied by fire, use Tuo Li Yi Huang Decoction. </p>
<p>When ulcers and swelling cause vomiting, with heat toxin attacking the heart, vomiting occurs during ulceration, which is an indication of Yin patterns; vomiting after ulceration indicates spleen deficiency. If there is intense heat causing pain, use the Huo Ming Decoction or Hu Xin Powder; if there is suppuration with pain, use the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder; if there is suppuration with swelling and pain, use Tuo Li San or puncture to drain it; for pain and constipation due to heat, use Nei Shu Huang Lian Decoction.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>For those with cold and dampness harming the stomach, add dried ginger and costus root to the Six Gentlemen Decoction; when wood dominates the soil, add peony and bupleurum; if phlegm lingers in the stomach, add balloon flower; for spleen deficiency or water invading soil, add cardamom and amomum; for stagnation harming the spleen, add sparganium, gardenia, astragalus, and cyperus; if dampness invades the stomach, double the amount of astragalus. Astragalus is a wonderful remedy for generating flesh and closing wounds. For those who feel nauseous from foul smells when using the toilet, it is still advisable to tonify the stomach. </p>
<p>Both the spleen and lungs being deficient is a serious issue; use the Revitalizing and Energy-Boosting Decoction with ginger and dates, or the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger, and, in severe cases, add aconite, or use the Complete Nourishment Decoction with roasted ginger. Yang deficiency is often due to mistakenly taking cold and damp substances, overexertion after an illness, vomiting and diarrhea, entering a dream and experiencing nocturnal emissions, or being invaded by external pathogens.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>At first, there are symptoms of false heat, still experiencing headaches and fevers, long-lasting chills with teeth chattering, abdominal pain like thunder, diarrhea and belching, spontaneous sweating and night sweats; this indicates a deficiency of yang with cold invading, known as the &quot;Eight Evils.&quot; Promptly use the Tuo Li Wen Zhong Decoction, and later use the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with added Fu Zi, or ginger and cinnamon. In severe cases, use large doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, with double the amount of ginger and Fu Zi, adjusting based on the warmth of the hands and feet.</p>
<p>After a breakdown, there may be fever and aversion to cold, intense thirst, restlessness, disturbed sleep, with diminished yang and excessive yin, manifesting as irritability and a flooding pulse that feels faint or absent upon pressure; this indicates extreme yang deficiency. Suddenly, there may be tightness in the jaw, and the back bends backward, leading to convulsions or hidden illnesses. Symptoms may include a lack of sweat with aversion to cold, or sweating without aversion to cold, representing the &quot;Nine Evils,&quot; all should have the Ba Wei Wan and combined with ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria in large doses.</p>
<p>If there is original weakness, fear, either from excessive cohabitation or abundant purulent sores, or inappropriate sweating or purging leading to afternoon fevers, dry mouth and thirst, and inability to sleep at night, with sores discharging purple blood, prescribe Si Wu Decoction, Tuo Li Yi Qi Decoction, or Shen Qi Wan. If there are dark and foul stools, they should not be treated. For blood-stained and stagnant stools, use Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction for rescue. </p>
<p>Sores and ulcers may sometimes heal, but with oral and nasal bleeding, exposed gums, all due to the bleeding from sores and ulcers, causing false heat to move erratically in the meridians. One should seek out the meridian involved, carefully examine the cause and treat accordingly.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>When the liver heat causes blood to move erratically, modify the Four Substance Decoction by adding Gardenia fruit, Peony root, Scutellaria, and Atractylodes. When liver deficiency cannot store blood, use Kidney Qi Pills. When heart fire cannot produce blood, modify the Four Substance Decoction by adding roasted Coptis, Peony root, Scutellaria, and Atractylodes. When spleen deficiency heat cannot regulate blood, modify the Four Gentlemen Decoction by adding roasted Gardenia fruit and Peony root. For stagnation in the spleen channel, use the Return the Spleen Decoction with Schisandra. For qi deficiency in both spleen and lung, use the Middle Qi Tonifying Decoction with Schisandra. When both qi and blood are deficient, use the Ten Complete Restoration Decoction. When yin fire is disturbed, add Schisandra to Kidney Qi Pills. Generally, if there is excessive blood loss accompanied by symptoms like restlessness and thirst, regardless of the pulse condition, immediately use a decoction of ginseng. The classics say: &quot;Blood is generated by qi.&quot; If not for sweet warming herbs like ginseng, astragalus, frankincense, and atractylodes to nourish heart and liver blood, recovery is impossible. When there is fever and a strong pulse, it indicates death.</p>
<p>The &quot;Correct Transmission&quot; states that goodness aligns with the natural order, while evil goes against it. For wounds and ulcers, avoid inversion, as it leads to further complications known as the Nine Reversals, which is quite reasonable. </p>
<p>Neither boil nor sore, nor ulcer nor eczema, resembling a malignant sore, whether healing or severe, is termed an unnamed swelling toxin. Depending on whether symptoms are external, internal, or channel-related, after cleansing with branches of locust tree, use ground red beans, Wu Yao, white resin, Coptis, Berberine, Fritillaria, sulfur, glutinous rice, yellow lead, and light powder for topical application with sesame oil. All malignant sores that are unrecognized by people are treated similarly.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The consumption of rich foods can lead to severe carbuncles. Indulging in spicy and rich flavors, consuming roasted and fatty meats, and accidentally eating carrion animals can accumulate toxins within the body, leading to sudden outbreaks. Additionally, sudden exposure to strong winds, dense fog, extreme heat, or severe cold, along with the noxious energies of nature invading the meridians, can provoke these toxins and cause eruptions. Sometimes, exposure to toxic gases from dead animals, snakes, or insects can lead to rapid deterioration. </p>
<p>Initially, the onset may cause sudden pain from contact with clothing, or it can develop into blisters from scratching eczema, starting as a small sore that can be deadly within a day or two, more toxic than boils. </p>
<p>Carbuncles can appear in various locations; they are slower to manifest on the shoulders, back, or waist but are most urgent when they occur on the head, face, ears, nose, mouth, roots of the tongue, lips, or between the bones of the hands and feet. If they develop on the legs, often there are red streaks leading to the navel; if they occur on the arms, red streaks often extend to the heart; if they appear on the lips or inside the mouth, red streaks may reach the throat, making them particularly difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Immediate medical attention is necessary. The affected area should be pricked with a needle to draw out blood and release the toxic gases to preserve life.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>The sore head is black and hard like a nail, with red margins, like a fiery root, protruding more than an inch, changing to a charred black, and soon swelling and becoming shiny, turning into a wet, rotten state with deep holes penetrating the flesh, resembling a large needle piercing through. In its initial form, the sizes vary, sometimes like a water blister, like Wu Yu, like a bean, or like a pomegranate seed. Its colors are five; the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; categorizes them according to the five organs, each belonging to specific locations. The &quot;Collected Formulas&quot; distinguishes thirteen types of festering sores, including fish navel sores, which have a deep black sore head, shaped like a fish navel, when broken, yellow fluid seeps out, and the edges generate a浮浆, its poison especially severe. Use snake gourd leaves and tendrils, along with scallions and chives, mixed with wine and taken; the residue is to be applied under the armpit. If the illness is in the left hand, apply under the left armpit; for the left foot, apply under the left thigh. The same applies for the right hand and foot. For the center, apply around the navel. Additionally, bind it with cloth, waiting until the flesh around the red thread turns white, then it is safe. Those with excess heat also find it suitable. It is important to have someone hold them, for fear that they might tremble and become difficult to treat. Alternatively, one can use burnt snake shedding ashes mixed with egg white for application.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>Another type of water swelling involves using fourteen leaves of yellow jujube, three heads of garlic, and two qian of herbal powder, all ground with wine and taken to induce sweating, which is highly effective. Among various symptoms, vomiting is the most dangerous.</p>
<p>For differentiation between excess and deficiency: for excess, initially take three pills of Saiming Dan, along with scallion wine to induce sweating; for exterior symptoms, use Chuiding Decoction, or Bai Du San with cicada slough, silkworm, and honeysuckle; for interior symptoms, use Huo Ming Yin or Wu Sheng Tang; for excessive fullness and dampness, use Huang Lian Xiao Du San, which is effective upon initial use. For those wishing to generate pus, use Tuo Li Xiao Du San. </p>
<p>For deficiency, initially take Bao Sheng Ding to detoxify, or toad liver pills; if there is an exterior pathogen but sweating is not tolerated, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Fang Feng and Bai Zhi. For interior symptoms where purging is apprehensive, use Feng She San; if swelling and pain threaten to produce pus, use Tuo Li San or Nei Tuo Shi Xuan San; if it cannot rupture, supplement with Da Liao Shen, Qi, Gui, and Zhu to replenish, or combine Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Sheng Mai San to prevent toxin invasion.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>Those with a clear heart and spirit, if afflicted by toxic boils entering the heart, will experience confusion, dry mouth, restlessness, and a state resembling drunkenness, with vomiting that is unpredictable—this is a dangerous condition. For those with substantial vitality, use the Detox Pill to resolve myriad ailments, brewing a decoction of huanglian and danggui; for those lacking vitality, use a decoction of Guxiong and Danggui, adding fuling, fushen, yuanzhi, and lotus meat for clarity. If toxins ascend and attack the heart, for those who vomit, the Heart Protecting Powder is recommended; if someone has vomited after taking the Saimeidan, this should also be treated. For those feeling dazed and disturbed, unable to sit or lie still, experiencing thirst, bodily pain, and constipation, administer the Loulu Decoction; for those feeling irritable and thirsty, use a decoction of bamboo leaves and huangqi.</p>
<p>For external treatment: in milder cases, grind to a powder single toad venom and mix it with white flour and yellow lead to form pills the size of wheat grains; pierce the top with a needle and insert one for effect. In severe cases, use Saiming Pill; in dire conditions, employ a nailed iron rod. </p>
<p>For cases of sudden death, it is often due to toxic boils. Use a lamp to illuminate the body; if there are any small sores, one should promptly cauterize them and also take the Saiming Pill, as there have been instances of recovery. In remote areas where medicines are hard to procure, cauterization can provide a chance of revival. However, solely relying on diuretics and dispersing remedies can be perilous.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Red Silk Sores</strong></p>
<p>Due to irregular emotions of joy and anger, the blood and qi reverse and manifest between the hands and feet, resulting in yellow blisters, which sometimes turn purple-black. There appears a red thread that extends straight up; if it reaches the heart and abdomen, it causes confusion and loss of consciousness. If there are two or three red threads, one should quickly use a needle to transverse and puncture where the red thread reaches, causing it to bleed. Afterwards, apply a medicinal plaster or chew duckweed root to apply it, which will lead to immediate healing.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Bone Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from long-standing ulcers that fail to nourish the affected area with qi and blood, leading to rotting over time, with bone exposure. It is advisable to tonify the spleen and stomach to strengthen the vital energy, using formulas like the Ten Herbs Decocted for Overall Reinforcement and Kidney Qi Pills. Externally, one should apply aconite cake for moxibustion or use the scallion steaming method to dispel cold pathogens and nourish the essential qi, leading to the exposure of the bone and closure of the ulcer. If there is a deficiency of kidney qi, the bone gradually swells, and with the passing of time, it may break open and discharge pus. The scallion steaming method should also be employed. If an aggressive treatment is used, it may cause more deficiency of the righteous qi and aggravate the pathogenic factor, leading to frequent mistakes. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and hardness of the hard palate that has persisted for over a year without healing, accompanied by internal heat, fatigue, and thirst, use the Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction and Kidney Qi Pills. As the vital energy gradually recovers, a piece of bone may be expelled, and the previous medicine should continue to be taken until complete recovery. There may also be cases of bone exposure from swelling on the back of the foot or the back of the hand.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong></p>

<h3>Guidelines on Cold, Heat, and Conditions of the Body</h3>
<p>For conditions such as back boils and furuncles, regardless of size or pain—whether heat or cold is present—if it grows from small to large, swelling to over a foot in size, and is red and hot, one should urgently apply a medicine to contain the redness and swelling, preventing it from spreading. In the center, use a poultice to draw out pus and toxins, facilitating their expulsion. Internally, take herbal remedies to expel the pus and resolve the internal toxins. Wait for the pus to form before carefully creating an opening to let it out, considering the size and depth of the wound. If there is a significant discharge of pus, it is crucial to replenish the body internally. Even if only a small amount of pus is released, further purging is necessary. After expelling the toxins, exercise caution to prevent re-swelling. Pain should subside, and the swelling should diminish; the patient should feel lighter, indicating a favorable recovery. It is essential to regulate diet carefully. If heat and toxins are severe, resulting in excessive thirst, drinking cold water or similar substances may occur; this indicates that toxins are attacking the heart, leading to dry mouth and thirst. In such cases, using heart-qi tonics to nourish the organs will suffice.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br><strong>Places Where Abscesses Should Not Be Worrying:</strong></p>
<p>The void behind the eyes, the area where the jaw connects to the bone, the hair between the root of the genitals, the junction of the hip and tailbone, the area in front and behind the ear where it connects to the jaw, all of which can lead to abscesses caused by wind and water in the lower abdomen, as well as the hollow just behind the ear under the jaw, and the center of the nose which can also be harmful. However, with various treatments, some may achieve healing. The void behind the eyes is the most dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Boils:</strong></p>
<p>Boils occur on the limbs, presenting as yellow blisters, sometimes purple or black. There is typically an itch followed by pain, beginning with cold sensations and then transitioning to heat. Boils must arise between the hands and feet, manifesting as yellow blisters, which may appear with a purple-black hue, accompanied by a line that runs straight up like a red thread. In urgent situations, one should immediately use a needle at the point where the red line leads to, to pierce and release toxic blood. Then apply medicine such as toad fat and frankincense paste directly on the boil. It is best if the patient feels pain and bleeding during the needling. Otherwise, if the red line extends to the abdomen affecting the heart, it could lead to serious danger. Another method is to drain along the corresponding meridians.<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br><strong>The Source of Sores and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>The prescriptions describe five sources of sores and abscesses: first, climatic factors; second, internal emotional distress; third, bodily weakness leading to external pathogens; fourth, the body&#39;s heat interacting with wind and cold; fifth, consuming fried food, drinking alcohol, and using mineral medicines, all of which generate heat toxins. In summary, these sources do not go beyond three causes. </p>
<p>As for external factors, there are four causes of climatic sores and abscesses: first, excessive heat aiding the heart leads to sores. The classics state: &quot;Sores and rashes arise from the lesser yin.&quot; It also says: &quot;The lesser yin governs the heavens; warm air descends while lung qi ascends, leading to sores and ulcers if severe.&quot; Furthermore, it mentions: &quot;The governance of the lesser yin in its early phases begins with cold, yang qi becomes stagnant, and extreme heat arises, causing both internal and external sores and ulcers.&quot; It also states: &quot;Sores and ulcers arise where the lesser yang prevails.&quot; Additionally, it mentions: &quot;The governance of the lesser yang brings forth windy heat; in the presence of the greater yin, cold arrives at the right time, causing the populace to suffer from internal heat and external abscesses.&quot; Initially, when the climate is excessively warm, the illness manifests as sores in the skin; in the second case, when fire reverses and causes stagnation, the illness manifests as heat trapped above, resulting in sores appearing internally; in the third case, when extreme heat arrives, the populace suffers from pus-filled sores.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a><br>It is also said: The Sun governs the affairs of Heaven, and in the initial phase, the qi is great warmth, causing skin rashes and sores. These are all common transformations, indicating minor illness. It is also said: The Lesser Yin governs Heaven, where excessive heat prevails, leading to severe sores and ulcers. Furthermore, it is said: When the Lesser Yin governs, if guests dominate, there are sores and ulcers. Again, it is said: The resurgence of the Lesser Yin brings diseases such as rashes, sores, abscesses, and hemorrhoids. It is also said: When fire is excessive, it is labeled as radiant and tumultuous, resulting in abscesses and bleeding. Additionally, it is stated: When fire is trapped, people suffer from sores, abscesses, and swelling. These abscesses are the most severe form of illness. Secondly, cold evils injure the heart, causing sores and ulcers. The texts state: The Sun governs the affairs of Heaven. In the third phase, when cold qi circulates, people suffer from cold reactions and internal heat, resulting in abscesses. The commentary further states: The Sun governs Heaven; when cold prevails excessively, the blood changes within, leading to the development of sores and ulcers, with the illness originating from the heart. It is also stated: The Yang Ming governs the affairs of Heaven. In the fourth phase, when cold rain descends, the people suffer from abscesses and sores. Thirdly, dryness harms the liver, resulting in sores and ulcers. The texts state: When wood does not flourish, it is called &quot;dispersed harmony,&quot; where the upper shang is the same as the regular shang, with illness manifesting as abscesses and swelling due to evil harming the liver.<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a><br>It is said: Yangming governs the heavens, and when dryness overcomes lust, the people suffer from sores and abscesses, which originate from the liver. Fourthly, there are sores and abscesses due to dampness. The classics state: Taiyin governs the heavens, where humidity transforms substances; if severe, it results in abscesses behind the body. It is further stated: The victory of Taiyin involves internal confinement of fire, leading to sores inside that spread outward. These four points refer to the seasonal influences of the heavens. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; on the essentials of pulse: The Emperor asked: What causes abscesses, swellings, muscle spasms, and bone pain? How can they be treated? Qibo replied: These are swellings from cold and changes from the eight winds. The Emperor asked: How should they be treated? Qibo replied: These are maladies of the four seasons, and thus are cured by addressing what predominates. </p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states in the chapter on abscesses that blood vessels nourish and protect, circulating without rest; they correlate with the stars above and the cycles below. When cold evil invades the meridians, it causes blood to weep; when blood weeps, it cannot flow freely. Without free flow, the protective qi cannot return, resulting in abscesses and swellings.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a><br>When cold transforms into heat, heat dominates, leading to decaying flesh; decayed flesh turns into pus. If the pus does not drain, it rots the tendons; if the tendons rot, they injure the bones. When the bones are injured, the marrow depletes. If the bones are hollow and do not drain properly, the blood becomes desiccated and empty, resulting in the tendons, bones, and muscles failing to nourish each other. The meridians collapse and leak, affecting the five organs, which leads to death.</p>
<p>Moreover, the &quot;Theory of Vital Energy and Its Connection to Heaven&quot; states: exertion and sweating in the wind leads to cold-mediated rash; stagnation causes acne. It also mentions: the Yang energy cannot open and close properly. When cold is present, significant deformities arise. If the nourishing energy does not follow, it resists the flesh, resulting in boils and swellings. This is also due to cold evils entering through the gaps left by exhaustion and sweating, as well as the inability of the Yang energy to open and close, leading to prolonged infestations causing boils and swellings. This refers to physical weakness and external invasion, as well as body heat clashing with cold wind.</p>
<p>The treatment should therefore focus on critical methods such as the Ten Essential Scattering Decoction, Five Spice Soup, and Clean Ancient Atractylodes Re-boiled Powder. Regarding internal causes: Chen Wuze states that the occurrence of boils, abscesses, and nodules does not distinguish between deficiency or excess, cold or heat; they all arise from Qi stagnation. The classics say: Qi lodges in the meridians, becoming thick with blood and stagnant, resulting in boils and abscesses. It does not say that heat alone causes boils; rather, they arise from emotions like joy, anger, worry, and thought causing stagnation.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br>To manage it with the principles of distant aspiration wine and the unique supremacy powder, along with the theory of the five aspirations overcoming one another—as when anger overcomes thought—this is the essence. Regarding internal and external causes: It is mentioned in the classics that the transformation of rich foods can lead to great sores, which is like holding emptiness. In the eastern region, where fish and salt are abundant, the people consume fish and have a fondness for salt, finding contentment in their life and joy in their food. Fish is hot, and salt overcomes blood, hence the people exhibit dark, loose skin, and their ailments manifest as carbuncles. Additionally, there are those who consume elixirs made from realgar and stones, which is also a variant of rich foods. Li Dongyuan states: The transformation of rich foods stems from excessive flavors, the nurturing energy not aligning, thus conflicting with the essence of the flesh. The nourishing energy refers to the energy of the stomach. When food enters the stomach, it first moves to the spleen, then arrives at the lungs, from there it circulates through the hundred vessels, subsequently reaching the skin and hair, first traversing the yang pathways and then returning to the five organs and six bowels, thus forming the energy in units.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a><br>Nowadays, the wealthy do not understand moderation. They indulge in rich foods like wine and fatty lamb, mixing it with heavy flavors, which over time leads to an excess. Such rich substances are the essence of yang, but they cannot walk the empty pathway and instead move towards the yin, resulting in an overwhelming dampness. This causes the offspring to overpower the mother; fire thus flourishes, and with the humidity and heat in abundance, they inevitably harm the kidneys. If one is careless in sexual activity, it depletes their essence water. When water is scarce, it rises due to transformation by dampness, causing sores to emerge primarily on the back and head; this is the most severe form of major sores. If toxins arise from the lungs, or parts of the spleen and stomach, they are of lesser severity. If they emerge from other channels, they are even less so. The toxins of damp heat lead to decay wherever they settle. Therefore, the classics say that the transformation brought by rich grains leads to major sores; it is like holding a vessel that is empty, which can receive anything. The method to treat major sores must involve expelling the excess vital energy. In terms of root and branch, the initial illness is the root; without using bitter and cold medications, which should be the focus, one cannot alleviate the suffering and pain. Just as Dong Yuan treated Yuan Haowen and Dan Xi treated an elderly woman&#39;s brain boils, both used good wine, hence employing the method of Three Yellow and Da Huang wine for treatment. Similarly, remedies like pus-dispersing powders and Angelica powders are effective.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br>Additionally, if there is a condition caused by excessive effort in the living space, leading to an accumulation of vital energy, this is also not due to external or internal factors. The treatment should focus on nourishing the internal deficiency, avoiding the use of aromatic medications that deplete true yin and exacerbate evil heat. Medicines for treatment, such as Neiguhuangqi Decoction and Shenxiaotuli Powder, are to be employed. The classics say: &quot;The five organs are affected by internal heat, leading to abscesses in the six bowels.&quot; It also states: &quot;If the six bowels are not harmonized, they will form abscesses.&quot; Furthermore, it notes: &quot;All pains, itching, and sores relate to the heart.&quot; When the lungs overpower the liver, it leads to abscesses. If the kidneys transmit cold to the liver, it results in swelling and shortness of breath. If the spleen sends cold to the liver, it causes swelling and muscle cramps. These changes in the organs and bowels are also considered internal factors. Dongyuan states: &quot;The theory of vital energy communicating with heaven suggests that when the nourishing energy is obstructed, it goes against the flesh and leads to abscesses.&quot; It also mentions: &quot;Changes from rich foods can lead to severe boils and create a sense of deficiency.&quot; The theory of yin and yang indicates that dampness from the earth, when affecting the body, harms the skin, flesh, and tendons. This implies that external dampness injures the body and obstructs the flow of nourishing energy. The nourishing and protective energies are governed by the nourishing energy itself, which is also related to the gastric and operational energies.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a><br>The essence of vitality is fundamental; when it goes against its natural course, it becomes damaged by dampness, leading to lesions and sores. The changes brought on by rich and fatty foods indicate that excessive indulgence causes the vital essence to reverse its flow, congealing within the meridians and resulting in sores. This malevolent force is neither found on the surface nor within, but rather lies in the channels where the illness manifests. This aligns with what is stated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; indicating that the conditions arise due to the reversal of nourishing qi. </p>
<p>Upon examining various theories about sores and lesions, many mention the clash of two types of heat, leading to suppuration; some solely refer to heat causing pus; others state that dampness produces sores, transforming cold into heat that leads to pus. All these are sources of lesions. In the observed cases, medicinal herbs should be used in accordance with the principles discussed, also considering the differentiation between yin and yang conditions. First, one must drain the nourishing qi since its reversal fuels fire, combining dampness and heat, which deteriorates the flesh and leads to pus and blood. This treatment method is secondary; it is advisable to take materials that can be compared. </p>
<p>In a year, when extreme heat does not exceed the summer, all things do not rot. It is during the autumn dampness that decay occurs and flourishes. Examining the body, when a febrile illness is present and only manifests outward heat without damaging the flesh, the reasoning becomes clear. If the root and branch are not addressed and the malevolent qi is not subdued, one who understands one principle can be considered a master craftsman.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br><strong>The Difference Between Boils and Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When the nourishing and protective energies are obstructed within the meridians, the blood stagnates and cannot flow. When it does not flow, the defensive qi becomes blocked, leading to heat. When the heat becomes intense and does not cease, it overwhelms the flesh, causing it to decay, which then results in pus. However, it does not penetrate to the bone marrow, nor does it cause desiccation or harm the five organs; hence, it is called a boil. When the heat energy is exceedingly strong and descends into the muscles, causing the tendons and marrow to wither, internally connecting with the five organs, and when the flesh and bone beneath the carbuncle show no signs of life, it is termed a carbuncle. A carbuncle presents as a hardened skin area above, resembling the hide of an ox; whereas a boil has a thinner, more lustrous skin surface—this is its characteristic. The &quot;Gui Yi Fang&quot; states: The pain of a boil only manifests on the skin and erupts as if fire were burning straw. Initially, it may be the size of a millet grain, enlarging to the size of a palm in three to five days, or to the size of a bowl in five to seven days, making it easy to treat. However, if the swelling is cold, causing thirst and reversal of qi, treatment becomes difficult. Carbuncles may appear similar to small sores; upon touch, they cause deep pain, with slight elevation around the edges like an orange peel, displaying a faint red color without significant discharge of pus, resulting in incessant pain and difficulty breathing after seven or eight days. If a swelling initially rises high and then suddenly flattens after five to seven days, this indicates an internal attack. Furthermore, it is noted that boils and carbuncles are divided into three categories: superficial toxic qi afflicts the bowels, while deep toxic qi affects the organs. The severity of the toxic qi and its movement through the meridians can vary in depth and degree.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br>All the internal organs are affected by its poison, making it difficult to treat. It is crucial to urgently address the lesions wherever they erupt, regardless of whether they are severe or mild. The swellings are pronounced, tender, and painful, merely on the surface of the skin, with extreme heat and fullness, and may have itching or soreness, with no other alarming signs. Initially, use warm medicines to calm the energy, then use methods to drain pus and open the abscess.</p>
<p>The treatment for these lesions, referred to as calming energy, involves medications similar to rhinoceros horn decoction, utilizing ingredients like rhinoceros horn, forsythia, rhubarb, licorice, angelica, and cinnamon, all of which promote expulsion. The method of opening abscesses involves using needles, with soapberries as the main agent, supported by licorice, chuanxiong, and frankincense, which are also medications for expelling toxins. However, the methods from Jie Gu and Dongyuan that promote expulsion and open the abscess are more reliable.</p>
<p>For sores that arise anywhere on the body, regardless of size, if they occur on the back and extend one, two, or three feet, with thick, dark, purplish skin that is high and swollen, accompanied by internal pain like being stabbed by a needle, there is a heaviness in the limbs and pain in the chest as well. If such lesions occur elsewhere, they may be bearable, but if they are located in areas of deficiency or near the tendons and bones, if the pus and poison have not yet erupted, they may damage the tendons and bones. Flesh that is damaged and becomes sore belongs to the deep-seated toxic energy of the internal organs, with excessive energy being hard and solid, and thus it is not suitable for gentle treatment. The internal organs must be fortified, and the skin must be allowed to expel the toxins, so as to equalize the pus. It is essential to use medications that support the solid organ energy inside and drain the pus and harmonize energy outside; these conditions differ significantly from the superficial toxins of the lesions, and should not be treated as if they were the same condition.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a><br>All kinds of swellings, when first noticed as a high swelling that suddenly flattens in five to seven days, indicate an internal attack. It is urgent to use internal dispersing and nourishing decoctions to fill and strengthen the organs; the greatest fear is breaking through the membrane, as that results in death. Lou Quanshan states: If the evil of a sore is superficial, it is merely stagnation and obstruction in the meridians, thus treating it externally. Therefore, when it first appears, there is external heat, and the affected area swells like a bowl or basin, causing pain. In severe cases, it may even want to sink, but due to the solid righteous qi internally, it refuses to do so; hence, it may lead to constipation or thirst and reversal as resistance. As a result, the marrow never becomes exhausted, and the five organs remain unharmed. </p>
<p>If the evil of the carbuncle is deep, it clogs and obstructs internally, connecting to the five organs without attacking the exterior specifically. Thus, the body may not exhibit fever, and the affected area may be pain-free and not swollen. In severe situations, the voice may become hoarse, the spirit may weaken, and the eyes may appear dark and small, with the fingers swollen and black like ink, often resulting in death. </p>
<p>The treatment method for an initial carbuncle should primarily follow the ancient methods: disperse what is outside, purge what is inside, use fire for cauterization, and apply medicine topically. If there is no pus formed yet, it must be dissipated; if pus has formed, it must be quickly allowed to drain. For the initial appearance of a carbuncle, the formula &quot;Guili Fang&quot; should be the main focus, nourishing and filling the organs to prevent the sinking evil from spreading. Externally, use fire to draw the evil out, ensuring that the points are directed and not chaotic, then it can turn from death to life, transforming omens of misfortune into good fortune.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br>In the present day, the practice of surgery does not distinguish between abscesses and sores. For instance, in a case where heat is declared and toxins are expelled, externally, five spices are used to deplete the energy, and internally, rhubarb is employed to drain the blood. Ultimately, they cannot comprehend the fault of their remedies—what a pity! The &quot;Collection of Evidence&quot; states: the name of abscesses and sores. Although there are more than twenty symptoms, the essence boils down to two: yin and yang. Those arising from yang are abscesses, heat, and fullness; those arising from yin are sores, cold, and emptiness. Therefore, when it arises from yang, the skin is thin, red, swollen, and often has several pepper-like spots that are painful. When it arises from yin, the skin is thick and pale, the swelling is hard resembling the hide of a cow, and it is not painful. There are also cases of yin within yang, appearing to be heat but not true heat, although swollen, it is both solid and void, red but not dry, desiring pain yet having no pus, initially floating then dissipating, with external fullness and decaying flesh.<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br>Within Yin, there is Yang, appearing cold yet not truly cold, not swollen though real, slightly dry, with pus causing pain; externally it may not seem intense, yet internally it is bothersome. Within Yang, there is Yin; such individuals are often plump, their flesh tight yet internally weak. In contrast, those with Yin within Yang tend to be thin, with loose flesh yet a strong interior. There are cases where Yang transforms into Yin, often caused by excessive cooling agents from herbal medicine; and cases where Yin transforms into Yang, typically due to abrupt heat treatments. However, when Yang changes to Yin, the symptoms are more numerous, and it can still return to Yang, thus leading to a higher chance of survival; while Yin turning into Yang shows fewer symptoms, making it incapable of reverting to Yin, resulting in higher mortality. Occasionally, there are survivors, due to the physician coincidentally adhering to the principles, which happens one in a hundred occasions. Observing this, boils and sores only vary in the depth of Yin and Yang, and the distinction between internal and external deficiencies or strengths, but there is no difference in size. The &quot;Essentials&quot; claim that lesions two to five inches are boils, and those five inches to one foot are sores, which is incorrect!</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is deep and solid, with heat and irritability, and there is no external scorching red pain, the evil is deeply internal and should be cleared to eliminate its source. A floating, large, and rapid pulse, with heat and swelling externally, requires initially relieving the interior, for fear that the evil will enter inside. If the pulse is neither deep nor floating, and there are no internal or external symptoms, it suggests involvement in the meridians and should be harmonized with nourishing and protective energy. If the pulse is rapid but there is no fever, pus is present internally.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a><br>The pulse is rapid, indicating heat while showing aversion to cold; if there is a painful area, it may lead to a boil. If the rapid pulse does not appear at regular intervals, it may lead to malignant sores. </p>
<p>Floating swellings can indicate deficiency or wind; ulcers suggest deficiency and should be nourished. </p>
<p>A surging swelling suggests deficiency with excessive heat; it is appropriate to expel heat and draw out toxins. In younger, robust individuals, it is advisable to purge. If an ulcer shows excess evil qi and does not resolve despite prolonged medication, it can be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>A slippery swelling indicates heat; an ulcer can indicate heat, deficiency, or that the evil qi has not yet subsided. </p>
<p>A rapid swelling suggests the progress of disease and heat; if it is both rapid and surging, it desires pus; ulcers that are hard to heal with excessive rapidity are difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Scattered swellings indicate qi that cannot confine; an ulcer signifies unresolved pain. Surging, slippery, and widely scattered conditions are hard to treat. </p>
<p>A hollow swelling suggests blood deficiency; an ulcer indicates deficiency, aligning with pulse illness. </p>
<p>Prolonged swellings should follow methods to dissipate; ulcers are easier to heal, as being prolonged signifies treatment through qi. </p>
<p>A firm swelling indicates excessive evil; an ulcer indicates that the evil qi has not resolved. A swelling that is slow and expansive may be indicative of deficiency. </p>
<p>A string-like pulse indicates pain and a desire for pus; a stringy and surging pulse clashes, indicating external tightness and internal heat, which may lead to abscess formation; ulcers suggest blood deficiency and pain.<a id="trans-242p" href="#orig-242p" class="marker">[242p]</a><br>Swollen abscesses are tight and raised, accompanied by fever and chills, or localized pain, indicating a boil or sore; ulcers are characterized by qi and blood stagnation causing pain or the presence of external cold. </p>
<p>Stagnation refers to an abscess resulting from excess qi or qi obstruction; ulcers are due to blood deficiency and correspond to the disease pulse.</p>
<p>Shortness indicates that the swelling is due to a deficiency of original qi; ulcers signify a severe deficiency and require replenishment.</p>
<p>Mild swelling suggests a deficiency, with a gradual response to medication being ideal; a mild and even ulcer also indicates deficiency and aligns with the disease pulse.</p>
<p>Slow swelling indicates cold or deficiency; diminished pulse in the wrist suggests little blood; ulcers imply deficiency, where qi and blood cannot nourish the sore, also associated with external cold.</p>
<p>Gentle swelling is treatable; larger, gentler swellings indicate deficiency; a mild and stagnant ulcer heals since its pulse corresponds and the stomach qi is abundant.</p>
<p>Deep swelling suggests the presence of evil qi; an ulcer indicates residual toxic material within. A deep pulse corresponds to phlegm in the chest.</p>
<p>Hidden swelling indicates the presence of Yang pathogenic factors within Yin; ulcers are indicative of inner erosion where Yang is hidden within, leading to difficult treatment due to infiltrating fluids.</p>
<p>Deficiency in swelling calls for internal nurturing; once ulcer pus is drained, substantial tonification of qi and blood is advisable.</p>
<p>Weak swelling indicates inadequate original qi and necessitates internal support; ulcers correspond to the disease pulse and also require tonification.</p>
<p>Consolidation in swelling suggests the accumulation of pathogenic qi; if an ulcer gradually becomes uniform, healing occurs; if not regulated, it poses a risk.</p>
<p>Rapid swelling suggests heat and advancement of the disease; ulcers reflect unrelenting heat—gradual progression leads to death, while gradual regression results in recovery.</p>
<p>Transition indicates the deterioration of qi and blood, alongside the depletion of original qi in ulcers.<a id="trans-243p" href="#orig-243p" class="marker">[243p]</a><br><strong>Dividing the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The human body has meridians, just as geography has boundaries. To treat illness without understanding the meridians is like trying to catch a thief without knowing the boundaries; how can one avoid the blame for errors and misdeeds? Moreover, among the twelve meridians of the hands and feet, there are differences in the amounts of blood and qi. For example, the hand’s lesser yang sanjiao, lesser yin kidney, and greater yin spleen have more qi and less blood; the hand’s greater yin heart covering, greater yang small intestine, and foot’s greater yang bladder have more blood and less qi; while the hand’s greater yang large intestine and foot’s greater yang stomach have both more qi and more blood. This is the broad comparison. Those with more blood and less qi are easier to heal, while those with more qi and less blood are harder to treat. In meridians rich in qi, one can promote its flow, whereas in meridians rich in blood, one can disperse it; one must not cling to a singular aspect.</p>

<p>Wounds and sores have traditionally been divided into five goods and seven evils. The first good is the ability to move and rest in peace, enjoying food and drink; the second good is the convenience of regulation and balance; the third good is the clarity of pus, the reduction of swelling without odor; the fourth good is spirit and brightness, with a clear and pleasant voice; the fifth good is a balanced body and energy. </p>
<p>The first evil is when one is restless, coughing during discomfort, experiencing severe abdominal pain, insatiable thirst, or excessive diarrhea, with urination as if dripping; the second evil is characterized by profuse bleeding with pus, extreme swelling and heat, foul and decaying pus, with pain too intense to approach; the third evil is shortness of breath and faintness, a tendency to excessive sleep; the fourth evil includes improper eyesight, with tight, small black pupils, and discoloration in the white part of the eyes; the fifth evil consists of difficulty in the shoulders and back, heaviness in the limbs; the sixth evil is being unable to eat or vomiting after taking medicine, with food lacking flavor; the seventh evil includes a hoarse voice, pale complexion, blue and red in the nose, and swelling in the face and limbs. </p>
<p>If three of the five goods are present, recovery is possible; if four of the seven evils are present, the situation is critical.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a><br><strong>Reality and Illusion</strong></p>
<p>In cases of sores, ulcers, and suppuration, where swelling and toxins permeate, it is crucial to distinguish between reality and illusion. Moreover, the ill state of the body under virtual circumstances is hard to restore, while the real condition is easy to purge. The methods of reinforcement and purging should not be used lightly. A slight deviation could lead to significant consequences. </p>
<p>However, distinctions between reality and illusion are numerous: there is the virtual and real concerning sores, organs, and blood; there are conditions of excess above and deficiency below, as well as true deficiency and false excess that must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>For instance, when swelling is hardened and pus thick, that signifies real sores; when swelling is soft and slow with thin pus, it indicates the virtual aspect. If there are symptoms like diarrhea, rumbling in the intestines, inability to eat, vomiting at irregular times, cold hands and feet, weak pulse, cold skin, spontaneous urination, or difficulty urinating, with smooth bowel movements, an inaudible voice, and a lack of spirit, these all indicate the deficiency of the organs; while hard stools, scant urine, normal appetite, abdominal distension, chest and diaphragm pressure, joint pain, bitter mouth and dry throat, restlessness and excessive thirst, fever, strong pulse, and dull spirit, all indicate the excess of the organs.</p>
<p>If the pus is clear and thin, the sore does not close, the swelling is not red, the skin is cold, and there is spontaneous sweating and pallor, this shows a deficiency of qi and blood; but if the swelling appears red, with chills or heat and pain, hot skin, thick and sticky pus, and heaviness of the head, it indicates the excess of qi and blood. </p>
<p>Headaches with nasal congestion, red eyes, heart palpitations, throat discomfort, mouth sores, excessive thirst and cold drinks, talking in sleep and grinding teeth indicate an excess above; while slippery essence that cannot be contained, spontaneous bowel movements, heavy lower back and legs, and unsettled sleep indicate a deficiency below.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a><br>Shoulder and neck discomfort, heavy limbs, misaligned vision, unclear sight, tasteless food, hoarse voice and pale complexion, swelling of the limbs are signs of deficiency of vital energy; if there is severe swelling, unbearable pain, persistent accumulation without resolution, alternating chills and fevers, constipation, dripping urination, mental agitation, and confusion, it indicates the presence of pathogenic energy. It is also said: if vital energy is depleted, it leads to deficiency; if pathogenic energy is strong, it leads to fullness. Furthermore, it is stated: all pain indicates fullness, while itchiness indicates deficiency. Additionally, if the pulse is strong and rapid, it indicates fullness; if it is weak and soft, it indicates deficiency. For deficiency, one should tonify it, harmonize the energy, and open the channels; for fullness, one should drain it, clearing the pathways to self-guide the energy. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that blood fullness should be resolved, while energy deficiency should be drawn out.<a id="trans-254p" href="#orig-254p" class="marker">[254p]</a><br>&quot;The texts state: If a person has excessive vigor and blood, with a fullness in the collaterals that stagnates and becomes festering, one must drain this to relieve the overwhelming heat. Conversely, if a person has little appetite and thoughts, with weak spirit and a deficiency in the collaterals, causing cold to congeal and lead to festering, one should nourish them to restore the vital energy. This is the fundamental principle for treating deficiencies and excesses. </p>
<p>When sores and abscesses cease to hurt, and when one knows the taste of food, the pulse and symptoms are both relaxed; if they are relaxed, the treatment can proceed from a place of fundamental balance, using harmonious medicinals, and healing will surely follow. However, if the pulse is full, hot, swollen, causing agitation with alternating cold and heat, both pulse and symptoms are excess, and only intense agents like sodium sulfate and yellow medicine can remove it; using harmonious medicines in this case would not work. </p>
<p>If abscesses are swollen without rupture, or if the pus is clear and thin, or if there is diarrhea with rumbling intestines, lack of appetite, or vomiting at all times, or coldness in the hands and feet, this indicates a deficiency in both pulse and symptoms; only a strong nourishing approach can stabilize the condition, and using harsh purgative agents would be ineffective. Therefore, when treating these symptoms, one must discern between exterior and interior, deficiency and excess, and treat accordingly to achieve complete restoration.&quot;<a id="trans-255p" href="#orig-255p" class="marker">[255p]</a><br><strong>Internal Dissolution</strong></p>
<p>For the condition of boils and carbuncles, which may appear in various places, it is essential to promote internal dissolution at the initial stage when redness, swelling, and gathering occur. This can be achieved by administering herbs that invigorate qi, activate blood circulation, detoxify, and reduce swelling. One must carefully consider the depth, size, and locations of the affliction, as well as the condition of the pulse—whether it is weak or strong. </p>
<p>If the boils manifest on the back of the head, waist, neck, or buttocks, they belong to the Taiyang channel, and suitable herbs include Huang Lian and Qiang Huo. For boils located on the back and sides, which are closer to the Shaoyang channel, herbs such as Chai Hu and formulas like Bai Du San and Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin are appropriate. If the condition is intense and the pulse is strong, remedies such as Lou Lu Tang, Nei Shu Huang Lian Tang, and Zhuidu Wan should be used to promote relief. </p>
<p>In cases of qi deficiency, the main herbs are Ren Shen and Huang Qi; for blood deficiency, Xiong Gui is primary, supplemented with detoxifying herbs. Depending on the distinct characteristics, guiding herbs must be directed to the site of the disease. In the six channels, if there are boils, each of the five channels should adjust according to their respective elemental qualities of cold, warmth, qi, and blood to either tonify or purge. However, the Shaoyang channel, though termed as having excess qi and deficient blood, is deficient in both qi and blood; thus, the treatment follows the same principles as for qi and blood deficiency.</p>
<p>Various herbs such as (plant) Lu, She Gan, Chuan Shan Jia, Jin Yin Hua, Xia Ku Cao, Chan Su, Lian Qiao, Di Ding, Shu Nian Zi, and Mu Bie Zi, are classified as internal dissolution medicines. Formulas like Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin, Nei Xiao Wan, Zuo Mu Yin Zi, Niu Jiao Yin Zi, Che Ao San, Fan Hun Dan, and Xiao Du Yin are recognized as internal dissolution recipes. However, it is often overlooked that balancing tonification and purging, regulating cold and heat, and normalizing qi and blood can enable internal resolution. For external application, using Zige Tang for washing, along with powders and plasters, also aids in harmonizing qi and blood, leading to a reduction in swelling and heat.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a><br><strong>Internal Replenishment</strong></p>
<p>When a carbuncle has formed and the blood and qi are deficient, or the evil qi is deep-set and scattered, it cannot rise prominently or easily discharge pus; sometimes after rupture, there may be little pus, or the pus may be thin and clear, or the area may be hard and not softening; or even if pus is obtained, the root may be red, swollen, and enlarged; or if the toxic qi does not emerge, the wound may not close, swelling is not red, and there are tubercle-like forms without pus, all indicating a deficiency of qi and blood. Once qi and blood are deficient, combined with the evils of the six excesses leading to various symptoms, internal replenishment must be employed to expel the toxic heat from the body&#39;s surface for recovery. Medicines for internal replenishment primarily focus on tonifying drugs, assisted by drugs that invigorate blood and dispel evils, or by aromatic drugs to move through stagnation, or by warming drugs to counteract wind and cold. Generally, essential medicines include those for expelling toxins and dispersing stagnation, such as Decoction to Release Toxin, Decoction to Disperse Stagnation, Small Decoction to Release Toxin, and the Ten Xuan Decoction, but adjustment according to the situation is key. For those with qi stagnation in winter, the Five Spice and Forsythia Decoction; for the weak, reduce Da Huang. For those who should avoid cold medicines, use the Small Five Spice Decoction. If the form and pulse are strong and the pus is thick, do not use tonifying drugs; instead, consider something like the Honeysuckle Pill. If large amounts of pus are discharged, necrotic tissue is removed, and swelling has subsided, one should use large doses of Astragalus, Ginseng, Angelica, and Atractylodes to nourish qi and blood, promoting the easy growth of new flesh.<a id="trans-257p" href="#orig-257p" class="marker">[257p]</a><br><strong>Application of Poultices</strong></p>
<p>When a sore or swelling first appears and seems to have a head but has not yet developed, it is appropriate to apply a warm medicated poultice to draw out the heat and toxins, akin to the idea of drying up fire. If the swelling arises high and shows redness around the edges, it is advisable to crush cold herbs and apply a paste to counter the heat&#39;s force, expelling its evil, akin to extinguishing fire. Generally, the method of poulticing aims to alleviate swelling and toxins, open up the blood vessels, and address the interplay of cold and heat, all with the goal of preventing pus formation. For swellings with thick skin, apply medicated soft cloth or paper and wait until the medicine dries before changing it. For swellings with thin skin, use loose gauze or thin paper to apply the medicine, and replace it before it dries. After pus has broken, apply a warm ointment to nourish and regenerate the flesh, focusing on eliminating bad odors, expelling harmful fluids, removing dead tissue, and promoting healthy flesh, relying entirely on the power of the warm medicated ointment.<a id="trans-258p" href="#orig-258p" class="marker">[258p]</a><br>Do not use cold and cool medicinal solutions for application, as they cause blood stagnation and make healing difficult; blood vessels prefer warmth and dislike cold. The &quot;Collection of Proven Experiences&quot; states that for boils and sores without a head, applying Divine Pestle Ointment, Sacred Tortoise Ointment, Detoxifying Ointment, or Regular Iron Hooping Powder will lead to their reduction. For those that have burst, apply Sacred Tortoise Ointment, or use Detoxifying Ointment to expel pus, or use a tube to collect the pus. For lesions with heads, after washing, observe the redness and its width; mix the Regular Iron Hooping Powder with cool water to form an ointment. In the depths of winter, use warm water for mixing, akin to applying warm human flesh. For swelling and redness, use fresh Rehmannia juice for application. The method of surrounding application is to encircle from the four edges of the red halo, covered with paper. For sores that have developed white granules, scattered like rice or beans, use the tail of a silver comb to scrape the sore, apply Old Skin Powder, and then replace it with new medicine. Generally, more heat causes red swelling to dissipate, excessive heat may turn it purplish-black, external cold leads to a purplish hue, and deficiency of blood combined with cold results in a bluish-white appearance. Regular Iron Hooping Powder and Basic Iron Hooping Powder are commonly used remedies.<a id="trans-259p" href="#orig-259p" class="marker">[259p]</a><br>Certain conditions may arise due to the influence of wind, cold, heat, and foul qi, which affect one differently in the four seasons. One should be flexible and adopt suitable methods. For heat, one should use Sanhuang Powder; if the heat is severe, Sanxiao Powder is recommended. For wind, add Qianghuo and Fangfeng. If energy is stagnant, add Muxiang; if cold is constraining, add Gui. If there is foul qi, it is advisable to use fragrant medicines for fumigation; for swollen and tender areas, remove Biji. </p>
<p>When applying the medication, check the hairless areas for sweat beads. This signifies that the blood vessels are opening up, the heat toxin is dissipating, the redness is gradually shrinking, the pus is draining and pain is relenting, and the condition is improving. The skin and hair should become moist and lively, and the flesh should regenerate well; however, if there is slight necrosis at the abscess, do not use knives or scissors. </p>
<p>If the medicine does not promote sweating, necrosis will likely spread and become extensive. After pus has drained, it is essential to compress the area to eliminate lingering toxins, allowing them to exit through the sore. Use detoxifying plaster to draw out poison, and if necrotic flesh remains, use Jinbaogao. Following the removal of dead tissue, if the area is compressed, the qi and blood will circulate, and new flesh will grow easily.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a><br>For sore openings, use a long-lasting ointment. The medicinal paste applied should work in conjunction with washing treatments.</p>
<p>The method of the Guo family is as follows: if there is a head sore or ulcer, promptly use a piece of vermilion ointment about the size of a yellow bean, placing it on the sore. Then cover it with a soft adhesive plaster for protection; the sore will surely break. If the sore has a dark purple appearance, apply a poison-dissolving poultice externally to trap the toxic gas. If the sore has a bright red appearance, use a clarified ointment for application. The next day, use a firm jade tool to open the sore, then use a tight jade tool to remove the necrotic tissue, cleaning it slightly, and afterwards use a gentle jade tool to promote flesh growth. Collectively, these are called the &quot;blue and gold jade tools.&quot; </p>
<p>Regardless of the number of days, simply wait until the necrotic tissue is completely removed and apply the ointment. Once the pus has entirely drained and the flesh is smooth, you may then apply the medicinal paste for closing the sore. Following this method allows one to avoid the pain of knives and needles. Similarly, if there is a boil without a head, wait for the pus to form, then puncture it with a needle and proceed according to the method to achieve the desired effect. </p>
<p>Washing treatments.<a id="trans-261p" href="#orig-261p" class="marker">[261p]</a><br>Ancient scholars discussed that when sore swellings begin to appear and do not subside after one or two days, one must use decoction or water to wash and irrigate them. For swellings on the limbs, soak them; for those in the waist, abdomen, and back, wash them; for those in the lower parts, submerge them. This is all aimed at unblocking the pores and facilitating blood flow to eliminate stagnation. The &quot;Collection of Proven Experiences&quot; states: For the washing method, use two taels of medicine and three sheng of water, decoct to one and a half sheng, strain out the residue, and using clean cloth or new cotton, dip it in while hot to apply to the affected area. Gradually, one will feel relief, then continue washing; if it cools, urgently replace it, and be cautious not to use it cold! For swollen sores, wash with purple kueh decoction five to seven times a day. After each wash, pat dry and check if there are white grains the size of rice on the top of the sore; puncture them with five ashes ointment, apply old skin powder to the sore, and then use large iron hoop powder mixed with water to encircle the swollen red areas, and apply proper iron hoop powder mixed with water to the sore opening. Before the next wash, remove the old medicine. Each time you wash, replace it with new medicine as before. For ulcers, use pig trotter decoction to wash once or twice a day, still using large iron hoop powder as before for encircling the sore, applying detoxifying and purging medicines at the sore opening. After necrotic flesh is removed, change it every two to three days, and it can be replaced with growth-promoting ointment. The efficacy of washing helps initially release the evil qi and may cause it to subside; when it has formed, washing then unblocks the pores and harmonizes the blood vessels, drawing out heat and toxins from the inside to the outside, making deep issues superficial and large issues small. Swelling that extends, washing helps to reduce; dark purple hues become red and life-filled with washing.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a><br>Eliminate evil qi, dispel wind pathogens, and remove the old to give birth to the new. If a wound is cold and stagnant, preventing closure, wash it with a strong decoction of northern mugwort, and fumigate it with pine resin and rabbit fur. The washing medicines can be used in conjunction with iron hoop powder. </p>
<p>Generally, moxibustion, burning, and soaking each have their suitable applications. For abscesses, moxibustion is preferred over burning, while for carbuncles, burning is favored over moxibustion. For cysts or malignant tumors, soaking is advised. If the skin is swollen and smooth, it is suitable to open it with a needle to release the toxins. Recognizing it as an abscess, quickly apply a mugwort stick about the size of a mung bean and perform moxibustion with two hundred strong sessions. After moxibustion, if you feel a hot pain, it indicates that the fire energy has penetrated, driving the toxic energy out with the fire. </p>
<p>If the wound itches, mix light fermented soybean paste with pepper, ginger, salt, and onion, pound it into a cake about three qian thick, and place it on the wound for moxibustion. If it feels too hot, remove it, then replace it. The cake should be changed frequently. If the wound pains, re-perform moxibustion; stronger and more frequent is better. If it has already formed pus, do not moxibust, but open it with a needle instead. </p>
<p>Upon first noticing a sore on the back, which feels slightly itchy and painful, recognize it as a back attack. Take pure soil and water, mix and pound into a cake one inch in diameter and two fen thick, place it on the wound, and perform moxibustion with the mugwort stick, changing out each stick after use. For wounds the size of grains of rice, perform moxibustion seventy-seven times. For those the size of coins, continue without stopping day and night until healing is achieved. </p>
<p>For stubborn fistulous abscesses that do not respond to other methods, take a grub, trimming off both ends, place it on the mouth of the sore and apply moxibustion, changing it out after seven sessions, no more than seven must yield results. Additionally, moxibustion can be applied using the same method with a fire-moving bug, and results have been consistently effective, though the technique is mostly kept secret and often not passed down from fathers to sons.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 363: Surgical Abscesses and Related Toxins</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines</em> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>Swelling and Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Collection of Experience,&quot; the methods for treating ulcers are categorized into three names: &quot;boil&quot;, &quot;abscess&quot;, and &quot;carbuncle&quot;. A boil appears as an initial raised bump, red and lacking a defined base, visible on the skin, typically a width of one or two inches, with slight pain. After several days, it softens, the thin skin peels away, and clear fluid begins to emerge, eventually rupturing and discharging pus. If it does not break, a detoxifying poultice or needle can be applied to draw the poison out; once pus is discharged, it heals.</p>
<p>An abscess initially appears red and swollen, raised without a defined head; it is treated by puncturing it with a hot needle, which causes it to disperse. If it does not disperse, the needle should penetrate deeper, and it can be considerable in size, about three or four inches wide. Symptoms may include fever, chills, thirst, or in some cases, absence of fever with pulling pain. After four to five days, pressing it will reveal that it has softened.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a><br>This indicates that the toxic gas is shallow. In spring and summer, it is advisable to use Fangfeng Baidu San combined with scallions, ginger, and jujubes, decocted for consumption. In autumn and winter, omit ginger, jujubes, and scallions, and add Mu Xiang. For areas above halfway the body, add (the herb) Lou, and for areas below, it is advisable to add She Gan. For early conditions, simply use the powder. Alternatively, one may use Zhui Du Wan, Fan Hun Dan, or Fu Yuan Tong Qi San in small doses. If pus has formed, use a beryllium needle to open it, or use Ti Zhen Wan to bite it open. </p>
<p>Another type shows no change in skin color but is slightly swollen, with internal muscle pain, especially severe at night, along with fever, chills, and thirst; this indicates deep heat toxins, also known as abscesses, which can harm muscles, veins, and bone marrow. Over time, palpation reveals a softening heart; when pus forms, use fire to cauterize and drain the large pus, applying external Pou Du Ru Xiang Gao and taking internal soothing medicines. At the onset, quickly use a large needle to puncture the firm swelling to disperse it. Abscesses initially emerge as white grains the size of millet, accompanied by itching and pain. Touching them causes noticeable pain; this is the sign of an abscess beginning to develop. Promptly use a fire needle to puncture the white grain.<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a><br>If accidentally touched or immersed in hot water, one may feel slight redness, swelling, and pain. After three to four days, if it does not dissipate, a red halo begins to spread. Careful observation is needed to notice whether the halo is wide or narrow, approximately four to five inches in diameter. The whole body feels feverish and slightly thirsty, and the sore also feels hot; this is known as a boil. Use a fire needle to pierce about an inch deep into the initial white granule, spacing the punctures around one inch apart, making four punctures in total. Then wash with a decoction of four herbs, five to six times over one day and night. After washing, gently dry with soft cloth, and check for any new white granules forming on the sore, resembling millet; whether few or many, they can be removed with a silver spatula, avoiding any blood. If a little blood does emerge, it’s still acceptable, but avoiding blood is preferable. Then apply an old skin powder. Mix a cooling water solution with a large iron ring powder to surround the area, leaving the sore&#39;s opening untouched. At the sore opening, apply a mix of regular iron ring powder. Do not apply a plaster. If further washing is needed, first remove the surrounding medicine to clean the area, then wash again. After each wash, inspect the sore for new white granules; if present, remove them as before.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a><br>In the span of six to seven days, there are countless sores like a beehive, with pus unwilling to discharge, and still one must continue washing and applying dressings. In winter, use a blend of five spices and Lian Qiao decoction, adjusting the amount of Da Huang according to the condition; in summer and autumn, use Huang Lian and Qiang Huo powder; at the end of spring and the beginning of summer, use Fang Feng Bai Du powder combined with scallions and jujubes prepared as a decoction; after autumn, add Mu Xiang. </p>
<p>If the body is robust, with a strong pulse that is rapid and smooth, with pain, swelling, and heat closing in, one should use Da Huang decoction, Lou Lu decoction, Huan Ling Dan, Zhui Du Wan, or Fu Yuan Tong Qi powder to promote excretion; if the stool is already moist, use a stop for constipation remedy. This can be used for those under forty; for weak and elderly individuals, even if constipation is present, caution must be taken to avoid excess. </p>
<p>For sores that are hot and red, once the swelling and heat subside, switch to Tie Guo powder and avoid the use of fire needles. If symptoms persist seven to eight days later, and the initial white spots have formed, indicating that the channels are now open, and there is a large amount of internal pus, use small paper strips to facilitate draining through the channels, allowing it to flow slowly without the need for needles. If there is a need for the pus to be expelled, a large needle must be used to pierce, or puncture four to five areas around it.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a><br>The orifice is shaped like a beehive, and the pus refuses to emerge. Use proper iron hoops to apply a mixture of fragrant oil. When a white bump first appears, if touched mistakenly, one feels an uncomfortable sensation in the chest, a heaviness in the back as if carrying five to seven liters of rice. The body feels sore, the chest is bloated and restless, food tastes bland, and there’s a fear of the smell of food, akin to feeling coarse on the outside but soft like a melon on the inside. The poison of the sore is deeply seated, affecting the internal organs as well. Within three to five days, one can apply a heated treatment to the areas in the middle and around, allowing the toxic air to be discharged and the pus to flow from all openings. If after five to six days it does not disperse, the sore&#39;s peak will develop white bumps like pepper, increasing in number after a few days. Occasionally, there may be larger ones resembling beehive lotus seeds, which when pressed contain pus and blood but do not flow freely, occasionally releasing clear fluid, slightly swollen but not protruding, with a red halo around the root, gradually spreading out. It may itch or not be painful at all, or the root may become purple or red, growing to seven or eight inches, and the sore is not extremely hot; this condition is quite serious.<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a><br>Use a mixture of Zige soup and a cup of rice vinegar for washing, which can make redness vibrant. To treat white sores, apply the old skin powder, surround it with the large hoop powder, and coat the wound edges with the proper iron hoop powder. When following this method, if you notice a red halo around the root, it indicates that the medicine is effective, turning something severe into something mild. If the first sore appears and there are white spots on top with pus that cannot be drained, pressing on it feels firm, or if it gradually becomes painless, it is advisable to burn it open with fire. If the roots remain dark purple and the sore sinks down, resembling the darkening of a cow&#39;s neck skin, and if the flesh and bone are rotting, feeling heavy and indeterminate, apply detoxifying frankincense paste around it and continue to use the large iron hoop powder surrounding the foot, washed with pig&#39;s trotter soup. These methods should vary according to the symptoms; additionally, proper adjustments should be made according to the signs. If the pulse is weak, use a concentrated soup of paprika, ginseng, and angelica to regulate the poisonous flow. For all types of carbuncles and sores, one must take Wanquan powder; during summer, use Taohong powder for heart protection. If pus is observed later, treatment should be adjusted to ulcer care.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a><br>According to the treatment principles outlined in &quot;Ji Yan,&quot; one should not rely solely on them as absolute rules; future discussions should take precedence and various methods should be referenced. </p>
<p>For cases of swelling with heat and pain, where the pulse is floating, the pathogen is on the surface, and one should release it. If there is internal retention, one may use decoctions. </p>
<p>For swelling that is hard and painful with a deep pulse, the pathogen is internal and should be purged, for instance with Huang Lian Nei Shu Decoction, Xian Fang Huo Ming Drink, or Ku Shen Wan. </p>
<p>If there is no exterior heat or swelling, yet internal conditions are favorable for adjustments, the pathogen is in the meridians and one should harmonize the Ying and Wei (nutritive and defensive Qi) with prescriptions like Tuo Li Rong Wei Decoction, Bai Zhi, and Sheng Ma. </p>
<p>If there is heat, pain, agitation, or dryness of the throat with thirst, it is advisable to reduce fire with Huang Lian Jie Du Decoction. </p>
<p>For heat, pain, fever, or rigidity, or if there is a headache, then the pathogen is on the surface, and it is appropriate to disperse it with formulas like Jing Fang Bai Du San or Ren Shen Bai Du San. </p>
<p>In cases of severe pain or absence of pain, the pathogenic Qi is real; one may use garlic moxibustion and apply detoxifying measures, like Xian Fang Huo Ming Drink.<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a><br>Irritable with cold drinks, and having a rapid pulse with heat and pain, the pathogen is in the upper body; it should be cleared, such as with cool beverages or honeysuckle powder. </p>
<p>If feeling intensely cold without relief, it indicates a combination of solid Qi and cold pathogen; it should be promoted and supplemented, such as with Shixuan Powder. </p>
<p>If experiencing heat with pain, excessive sweating, great thirst, constipation, and altered speech, it is a case of yang accumulation; it should be purged, such as with Huanglian Neishujian Decoction or similar remedies. </p>
<p>If there is no pus or it matures but does not discharge, it indicates deficiency; it should be supplemented, like with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, Eight Treasure Decoction, or Shiquan Dabu Decoction. </p>
<p>For heat pain that is not painful or if numbness is experienced, the evil Qi is strong; it should be moxibusted with garlic. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and pain but no pus forms, it indicates congealed evil Qi; it should be resolved, like with Xianfang Huoming Decoction. </p>
<p>If swollen and painful with cold drinks, fever, and incoherent speech, it is heat; it should be cleared, such as with Qingxin Decoction, or with Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder added with Huanglian. </p>
<p>If there is no pus, does not rupture, or is not constricted, it suggests deficiency of yang Qi; it should be supplemented, such as with Tori Xiaodu San.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a><br><strong>Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Jiyan&quot; states: When the carbuncle has ruptured and pus has come out with the flesh decaying, one should apply a poison-extracting ointment. As the pathogenic qi gradually retreats, both qi and blood will also be deficient; thus, the pulse, which is full and rapid, should gradually be reduced. Internally, one must nourish the spleen to ensure that qi and blood are abundant, and the righteous qi is strong, leading to pus that is bright and thick, with redness and swelling gradually subsiding. The medicine should nourish qi and generate blood, with slight additions of remedies to resist wind and cold in the autumn and winter, such as cassia in the &quot;Shixuan San&quot; and &quot;Shiquan Dabu Tang.&quot; If there is stagnation of qi, add Xiangfu. If the toxicity has greatly receded but qi and blood have not yet recovered, one should frequently use ginseng, angelica, astragalus, and similar remedies like &quot;Sìwùtāng.&quot; Although the carbuncle has already produced pus, if the root area appears red and expands widely, whether painful or very painful, it indicates that the toxic qi has not retreated. Use &quot;Jinyin Baizhi San&quot; and &quot;Shixuan San,&quot; increasing the dosage of houpu, ginseng, chuanqiong, and astragalus, while also adding honeysuckle vine, forsythia, rhinoceros horn, and detoxifying drugs such as luogen.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a><br>At the end of spring, during summer, and at the beginning of autumn, it is advisable to add wine, Scutellaria, Coptis, Berberine, and Notopterygium; below the waist, you may remove Platycodon. After observing pus, one must prioritize tonifying qi and blood with the corresponding medicines, while also using detoxifying herbs to assist. If tonifying herbs are not suitable, one should consider using Yin Dong Wan. For swollen and inflamed areas around, use a fine needle to burn and prick them approximately one meter deep; if red and swollen, they will retract. It is best if the pulse becomes harmonious and gentle after taking the medicine. If the sore does not rupture but has hard edges, it is due to wind; apply Scorpion Powder. If the necrotic flesh does not decay, use realgar and light powder for application. It is highly discouraged for the redness and swelling to persist. If food intake is minimal, one should adjust the spleen and stomach accordingly, or if there are additional symptoms, treatment should be discussed separately. Necrotic flesh that does not respond to pain or itching can be removed, but care must be taken not to harm the surrounding healthy flesh or the good flesh inside. When removing black necrosis from the outside, one should also eliminate the yellow and white parts that are cotton-like in appearance. If there are red blood streaks in the pus, do not disturb; this indicates substantial pus that will likely fall off the next day, thus avoiding damage to healthy flesh. If fearful of incisions, it will still likely detach on its own in three to four days. However, using a knife facilitates quicker healing of new flesh while gradually dissipating toxic gases.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a><br>Eroded flesh can still grow a healing tissue when treated with pig trotter soup every other day. New flesh appears like plums or pomegranate seeds, vibrant and lively, gradually accumulating. If there is a white membrane on it, that is a good omen. However, if decay has occurred and the flesh below appears white and flat, lacking texture, it is not like grain and shows no sign of gradual growth. It may have clear or foul pus, indicating accumulated toxins that connect to the five internal organs, leading to blood depletion and danger. When the flesh cannot regenerate, and the vital energy and blood are insufficient, with no protective energy shielding the wound, wind and cold can attack it. One should use a northern moxa and astragalus soup for fumigation and washing, applying herbal ointments to promote growth. If the flesh grows but appears purple, it indicates remaining toxins. Use garden burnet soup, blood-activating powders, and apply detoxifying ointments; this will restore vitality. As the wound gradually closes, continue to apply the growth ointment. If the wound feels itchy, wash it with hot tea, scallions, and salt infusion. If the wound heals too easily, it may suggest internal heat toxins in the blood, preventing proper division. Even if growth occurs, one must guard against potential complications. If the wound opening becomes as large as a coin, it raises concerns about severe complications.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a><br>For abscesses and sores that have closed up, the skin remains tender and one should not hastily remove the plaster. According to the &quot;Ghostly Writings,&quot; whether an abscess or boil is large or small, painful or painless, hot or not hot, cold or not cold, if it swells from small to large and rises over one foot, and is red, swollen, and hot, one should immediately apply urgent medicine to encircle and confine the redness and swelling, preventing it from breaking open. At the center, apply poultices to draw out pus and disperse toxins, urgently expelling the toxins outward and using internal medicines to expel pus and reduce toxins. Once the pus forms, break the abscess in succession, observing the size and depth of the sore to release the pus effectively. If there is a large outpouring of pus, it is crucial to nourish the inside while expelling it. Even if the abscess breaks, if the pus is not abundant, further efforts to expel pus and toxins are still necessary. After dispersing, care must be taken not to allow swelling to return; one must ensure that the pain subsides and the swelling diminishes. If the patient feels lighter, it is a sign of recovery. It is most important to be cautious with diet. If there is a strong heat toxin, it may cause great thirst; excessive drinking of cold water or cool drinks can disturb the heart, leading to dry mouth and thirst. To alleviate this, medications that nourish the heart and support the organs should be utilized. Nourishing internally refers to herbs like ginseng and astragalus, while expelling pus refers to substances like soapberry.<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a><br>辨脓</p>
<p>The &quot;Collection of Evidence&quot; states: A tense and rapid pulse indicates that the pus has not yet formed, while a relaxed pulse with rapid beats suggests that the pus has formed. If pressing the area feels hot, there is pus; if it does not feel hot, there is no pus. If pressing brings a hard sensation, there is no pus; if it feels somewhat soft, pus is present; only when it is very soft is the pus fully formed. If pressing it causes pain, the pus is deep; if it does not cause much pain, it has not yet formed. If pressing it causes a rebound effect, pus is present; if there is no rebound, there is no pus. Light pressing that brings pain and shows a thin skin that is raised indicates shallow pus; if pressing causes pain in four locations but the skin color does not change and is not elevated, it is deep pus. Shallow pus should be treated with medicinal puncturing, elevated pus requires a needle, and deep pus should be cauterized. Further details on the conditions: if the swollen area is soft and painless, it is a blood tumor. If the swelling gradually increases without significant heat and causes pulling pain occasionally, it is a qi tumor. If the swelling is soft and yellow, it indicates fluid. Slight qi stagnation with mild swelling that persists and later turns into pus is caused by cold and heat.<a id="trans-276p" href="#orig-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a><br>Retention leads to accumulation over time, with yin accumulating and giving rise to yang. Cold transforms into heat, and this will inevitably cause rupture and create sores, so it is advisable to take internal medications early to expel it. Various tumors, warts, and growths will tend to rupture internally as one ages, and blindly using tonics without caution will surely lead to danger. As for scrofula and tuberculosis, persistent symptoms of cold and heat, along with thirst, will result in a pale and yellowish complexion, with heat rising and forming pus. The treatment can be found in the previous section. When abscesses on the hands, feet, fingers, or breast are involved, they should be allowed to mature sufficiently to a large extent before being opened. If there are abscesses in the joints, once pus is felt, it must be released promptly, or it may lead to contractures. </p>
<p>For extracting pus: When dealing with any boil or swollen abscess, apply pressure with the fingers around the edges. If the surrounding skin is red-black and does not change color upon pressure, the pus is already formed. If the area turns red with slight pressure, there is also pus. If it is initially white but eventually turns red, then the toxins have subsided. One can use moxibustion at the red and white areas until the flesh is flat and firm, and only then will it heal completely. </p>
<p>For abscesses, the skin is thin and the swelling is high, while for carbuncles, the skin is thick and the swelling is hard; both should ideally be treated with cauterization of mugwort initially.<a id="trans-277p" href="#orig-277p" class="marker">[277p]</a><br>When the pus from a boil has formed, it is suitable to use a needle; when the pus from a carbuncle has formed, it is appropriate to apply cauterization. It is essential to observe carefully and assess thoroughly, waiting for it to mature and for the pus to seep outwards, showing signs of readiness to be released. Simply use a needle or a pill to carefully pierce the abscess, and within half a day, the pus will drain out. One must not use a cutting knife!</p>
<p>As mentioned in &quot;Gui Yi&quot;: Any boils that are located in hollow areas or in places unseen by the eye are considered serious conditions. For instance, if there is high fever with red swelling, and the skin is thin and shiny, indicating there is pus and toxins within, and if all medications applied do not rupture, then a heated copper needle should be used, after being charred in oil fire. First, mark the spot with a black ink pen, then lightly prick it at the point with the needle. If pus flows out with the needle, that is a good sign. If the pus does not flow out with the needle, then one should use a white paper thread, inserting it into the needle hole to draw out the pus and toxins, which will reduce the swelling immediately, potentially by three parts.<a id="trans-278p" href="#orig-278p" class="marker">[278p]</a><br>If the swelling does not subside, it is a sign of a reverse condition; if the swelling does not subside and the pain does not diminish, but pus is produced, it indicates a more severe reverse condition; if the pus and pain do not recede, and the patient does not realize the wound is minor, this signifies an even more critical reverse condition. Even if needles are used to puncture and release the pus, it might not be effective; urgent use of a medicine to draw out the pus and support the body&#39;s strength is necessary. </p>
<p>Moreover, if an abscess forms in a solid area, regardless of its depth, any presence of pus should warrant the safe use of needles to burn, as slight cooling might risk injuring the muscles or bones internally. In cases near tendons, blood vessels, or joints, one must avoid reckless needle pricking and burning, as this could lead to other ailments.</p>
<p>When a sore first appears red and hard, it may be in a weak area with shallow toxins or in a solid area with deep toxins; careful discernment is required. One should inquire if the patient feels deep or shallow pain. Regardless of how many sores are present, there should be one that is the largest, indicating the major pus outlet. A large iron needle, with a point like a claw foot, should be heated thoroughly over a sesame oil lamp; with the larger end secured, it should be inserted one to two inches deep, where pus is expected to flow downward. If there is concern that pus may not yet be expelled, a piece of white paper can be fashioned as a thread and inserted, and removed the following day, as the pus will follow the thread out. </p>
<p>If the pus is yellowish-white, it is favorable; if it is red or black, precautions should be taken as fresh blood may follow, and the patient may experience uncontrollable chills. In cases of weakness, one should not recklessly use needles.<a id="trans-279p" href="#orig-279p" class="marker">[279p]</a><br><strong>Multiple Bone Sores</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about a sore on the foot or leg that has festered for a long time and has rotted down to the bone. What should be done? The answer is: This is called multiple bone sores, also known as excess bone or decayed bone. It occurs because of abundant toxic qi that accumulates and forms this condition, which is not true bone. It is advisable to take Winning Golden Elixir, the Totally Restorative Decoction with added Rehmannia and prepared Fangji, Purple Golden Elixir, Black Golden Powder, and Ren Shen Nourishing Vitality Decoction with added Papaya, Rehmannia, and Fangji in an alternating manner. This sore arises because, before it ruptured, the tonifying agents were excessive, leading to the accumulation of toxins without dispersal. It is recommended to apply celestial paper with Yellow Dragon Balm to the sore.<a id="trans-280p" href="#orig-280p" class="marker">[280p]</a><br><strong>The Evil Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>All painful and itchy sores belong to the heart. All damp and swollen fullness belongs to the spleen. The heart governs the blood, while the spleen governs the flesh. When blood is hot and the flesh is damp, the combination of dampness and heat breaks down the skin and persists endlessly. It cannot be definitively named, hence it is called the evil ulcer. However, there is a distinction: conditions like scabies, boils, and rashes, where stagnated qi and blood are located between the skin&#39;s pores, can be treated by dispersing them. The Inner Canon states that if there is sweating, the sore has already healed. If the stagnated qi and blood lie within the muscles but connect to the skin, causing alternating chills and fever, and producing pus, it may be due to emotional disturbances or the effects of rich foods. In such cases, it is advisable to resolve the internal heat, and sweating is not suitable. Zhang Zhongjing mentioned that for sores, one must not induce sweating; if one sweats, it will lead to spasms. </p>
<p>There is a distinction in whether to induce sweating based on the state of the sore, which may be shallow or deep, superficial or internal. Therefore, for sores on the skin, one should treat them lightly by inducing sweating, bathing them, and applying external remedies that kill insects, moisten dryness, and resolve stagnation. For sores in the muscles, one should reduce heat in the meridians, cool the qi and blood, and use poultices that promote pus formation and muscle regeneration. For sores on the head, one should expel them by drawing them out with cooling agents prepared with alcohol, additionally using wind-dispersing herbs to raise and elevate, while applying external medicines that kill insects and relieve heat. Understanding these three aspects accounts for more than half of the treatment for sores.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a><br><strong>Boils and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Boils and abscesses are named for their shape resembling a cap. They typically appear on the head, face, and limbs, often forming yellow blisters, and sometimes purple-black. They usually begin with itching, followed by pain, and initially cause chills before leading to fever. Within one or two days, a person may experience chills, fever, heavy limbs, palpitations, dizziness, headaches, and body aches, along with anomalous symptoms. One should carefully inspect the body; if there are small sores that differ slightly from usual sores, they are likely boils. Generally, purple blisters are common, while clustered lumps are rare. They frequently occur on the hands and less often in other areas. When they occur on the legs, red lines often extend to the navel; when on the arms, they may extend to the armpits; when on the lips or inside the mouth, red lines may reach the throat. If a needle is inserted into a sore, and there is no pain or blood, this is indicative. The classics state that indulgence in rich food causes large boils. Essentially, they arise from excessive consumption of rich delicacies, sudden intake of toxic foods, exposure to inappropriate seasonal influences, contact with snake and insect venoms, or the consumption of meat from animals that died of epidemics. When people sweat and mix it with food, it can also lead to boils. Each case should be carefully diagnosed and treated.<a id="trans-282p" href="#orig-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a><br>If vomiting and reverse qi are observed directly, and the speech resembles that of a drunken person, it is incurable. There is also an internal boil, which has symptoms similar to an external boil, but the sore does not appear. After several days, a localized swelling will arise; this indicates the site of the internal boil. If there is severe abdominal pain, one must treat it as an internal boil without delay, for procrastination can be fatal.</p>
<p>Hua Yuanhua states: Boils have five colors, corresponding to the five organs: red belongs to the heart and manifests at the root of the tongue; blue belongs to the liver and appears below the eyes; yellow belongs to the spleen and emerges at the lips; white belongs to the lungs and arises at the right nostril; black belongs to the kidneys and occurs before the ears. Classified categorically, texts such as &quot;Qianjin Fang,&quot; &quot;Wai Tai Mi Yao,&quot; and &quot;Shen Qiao Wan Quan Fang&quot; mention thirteen varieties, and possibly even more.</p>
<p>A &quot;mazi&quot; boil resembles a millet seed, being slightly dark with edges that are slightly red, often itchy with little pain; one should avoid eating sesame oil, wearing hemp clothing, and going into hemp fields, and should steer clear of people wearing hemp cloth. A fire boil arises on the vertex or face, with heat akin to fire, resembling burns from hot water; the sore’s head is black, with smoky edges, and it appears like red sorghum; one should avoid cautery and burning needles.<a id="trans-283p" href="#orig-283p" class="marker">[283p]</a><br>Spleen sores occur at the four whites of the lips. Eyebrow sores emerge on the eyebrows. Beard sores develop in the beard. Dragon Spring sores appear on the upper lip. Tiger&#39;s Whisker sores arise on the lower lip. Fish Tail sores manifest at the outer corners of the eyes. Cheekbone sores occur on the cheekbones; they are also known as red face sores, appearing sunken at the top like a coin hole, and if the nose has a purple color, it is very ominous. Ear sores arise within the ears; they are also called black sores and can cause red swelling along the jaw. Nose sores develop inside the nose, causing pain that radiates to the forehead, and cannot be treated if the nose looks like a large black bottle. Cheek sores appear on the high points of the cheekbones. Qi sores, resembling bubbles, arise from emotional anger. Rotten sores are white with blisters; within three days they sink in and look like early burn wounds, which occur when sweat drips into tofu during summer, so tofu should be avoided. Ghost sores arise from the poison of Yin evil. Gourd vine sores extend with numerous tendrils; walking in gourd fields should be avoided. Stone sores are rigid, connecting skin and flesh like stone, with a slight pain when pricked, and should avoid sand and gravel.<a id="trans-284p" href="#orig-284p" class="marker">[284p]</a><br>Salt skin sores are as large as a spoon&#39;s surface, with red edges and black dots that rise like millet grains; avoid eating salty foods. When washed with water, the sore resembles a coin shape or a coin hole, with a white center turning black, emitting juice and hardening in the middle, causing intense itching that penetrates to the bone; avoid washing in water, crossing rivers, or drinking spring water. Floating sores appear round and curved, somewhat irregular, long and narrow like the leaves of garlic, yellow inside and black outside, with the black areas being painless while the yellow parts are painful. Thirty-six types of sores appear with a black raised head, resembling black beans, surrounded by large red edges; one may appear today, two tomorrow, three the day after, up to ten; if they reach thirty-six, they cannot be treated with medicine, but those not reaching that amount can be treated; commonly known as black blisters, and one should avoid anger and the accumulation of sorrow and hate. Pig sores are round and small, with oil inside the sore. Sheep sores are long and white. Cow sores are round and small, with no oil inside the sore; the blisters are firm and cannot be easily broken, and there are sensations of cold and heat. Dog sores are red and long, sometimes pointed, similar to cow sores; there are no prohibitions, and they do not harm humans. Donkey and horse sores are triangular, with black dots on the top and red at the base, sometimes protruding.<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a><br>Water boils, appearing like bubbles, occur from drinking water left overnight; it is best to avoid drinking water. Navel boils arise at the navel. Side boils grow at the sides. Knife and sickle boils resemble garlic leaves, about an inch long, with flesh blackened like it has been scorched; it is best to avoid knives and needles. Dark boils appear under both armpits without a head, presenting as hard and tender armpits, with limbs feeling constrained, and intense chills and fevers; swelling and pain in the scrotum, with testicles protruding like boils, experiencing both chills and fevers, are also called dark boils. Inch boils develop between the joints of the fingers. Tiger mouth boils form at the He Gu point. Fish navel boils look like a fish navel. Vegetable berry boils are inwardly concave with protruding edges. Snake eye boils have a black, raised head, resembling a small bean and look like snake eyes; it is best to avoid being looked at with malice and jealousy or touching toxic substances.<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a><br>Red sore, also known as blood arrow sore, red sore, or red wart, appears under the root of the tongue, or on the head and face, or between the joints of the hands and feet. Its symptoms are urgent; one should pierce it to draw out the bad blood for healing. If treatment is delayed, the toxic gas can attack the heart, leading to vomiting, confusion, and death. If the sore is near the heart and abdomen, pierce at the end of the thread to draw out the bad blood, and also prick the initial sore to release the poison. Sesame sore moves unpredictably, causing body-wide pain and inability to turn or shift. Decayed sore oozes pus, is large like a spoon&#39;s surface, slightly dark with white spots; avoid hot broth and decayed food. Female sore has a slightly yellow sore head, appears dark inwardly, resembles a cauterized sore, with blisters around it, a deep red color, large like a coin hole, and may have another at a different location which shows when splashed with water; one must avoid sexual activity. Male sore appears with a blackish protruding head, surrounds like a raised edge with blisters that yield yellow fluid, large like a coin hole; also avoid sexual activity. Yellow sore has an eye on the skin, colored like gums, causes numbness in hands and feet, and those who cannot speak and drool are likely to die. Black sore looks like a black blister. Cherry sore resembles a cherry. Snake head sore appears on either side of the fingertip, looks like a snake head, has a very foul smell, is dark purple, causes pain radiating to the heart, and may have ulcers or detachment. Foot surface sore looks like corn, causes extreme itchiness deep in the bones, and should be urgently cauterized with garlic.<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a><br>Generally, they appear like beans, mortars, gold leaf, fruit of the wampi, or pomegranate seeds. They may present with rashes that break and ooze yellow or red juice, or cause sudden pain upon contact with clothing, or be white and swollen, or red and floating; their forms vary. If one first notices an inability to lift the head, one should urgently apply garlic moxibustion; if blisters form, it is a good sign, otherwise, it is ominous. Taking a sweat-inducing remedy will lead to survival if sweating occurs; if not, it will be fatal. If purple blood is drawn, it is dangerous; if black blood is drawn, it is lethal. </p>
<p>In cases of gradual onset, the first day&#39;s sores might be slightly white, on the second they turn largely white, on the third a slight purple, on the fourth truly purple, all indicating a slow progression. </p>
<p>In acute cases, on the fifth day they may be slightly blue and tightly swollen, on the sixth deeply blue and very tense; on the seventh day black in color, resembling a fish&#39;s navel or a moxibustion burn, indicating an urgent situation. </p>
<p>For all instances of sores, if there is body heat and headache, with hands and feet warm, and normal appetite, if the surrounding area of the sore is red and swollen, it is called &quot;protecting the field&quot; and can be treated.<a id="trans-288p" href="#orig-288p" class="marker">[288p]</a><br>When one suffers from sores, the whites of the eyes become dull and cannot move, there is a thirst for water, internal heat and sores are intense, the lips and tongue turn blue, one cannot get out of bed, the five hearts swell, the head feels dizzy, the eyes are blurred, breathing is laborious, food cannot be ingested, the pulse is weak and speaks in a slurred manner, nausea and abdominal pain occur, cold sweat appears, hands and feet are cold, and there is unrestrained diarrhea. If the areas around the sore show no redness or swelling, it is called &quot;not protective.&quot; This condition cannot be treated.</p>
<p>For urgent cases of sores, if a sore appears and another small sore develops on another part of the flesh, this indicates urgency, and a needle may be used to pierce and drain the protective area. If there is redness and swelling around the sore with multiple sores, it is termed &quot;starry sky.&quot; Eating and drinking occur normally, but there is a headache and fever, and the hands and feet are warm.</p>
<p>In severe cases of sores, if there are no sores on other parts of the flesh and no protective area exists, and if there is no redness or swelling around the sore but severe abdominal pain, there may be an internal sore. If poison enters the heart and abdomen, the eyes turn black as if seeing firelight, there is agitation, nausea, confusion, lethargy, and the pupils do not move, with a red pulse penetrating the eyes, and redness and swelling in the chest and sides, if the sore is deeply sunken and does not rise, it indicates a critical condition leading to death.</p>
<p>There must always be red streaks in cases of sores. Immediately use a needle to draw blood from the points where the red streaks reach, and also prick around the sore&#39;s head to draw blood. If pricking does not cause pain or produce blood, heat the needle until red hot and cauterize the affected area to the point of pain. If the lower body is affected, it is often advisable to use garlic moxibustion. If painful, cauterize until it no longer hurts; if not painful, cauterize until it becomes painful.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br>If the sore is cauterized and does not hurt, one should apply moxibustion directly and use a needle to pierce around the boil to let out bad blood; then use a lancet to deeply puncture the head of the boil. For the wound, apply a remedy made from sea horse to draw out toxins, or use male alum powder. Wait for the surrounding area of the boil to develop yellow blisters and swelling, indicating the presence of pain, which is favorable. If the boil has not yet come to a head, use a fire needle to pierce around it at random; if there is a red vein at the end, also use the fire needle to prick at three points to sever it, then apply medication immediately. If the boil is neither painful nor swollen, use moxa on the sore for three applications, waiting for yellow blisters to appear at the edges before applying a plaster. Generally, for a boil, one should puncture the center until it is painful, then prick around to let out bad blood, applying medicine afterward; the medicinal properties should enter through the needle holes. If the needle does not penetrate the wound, it will not be effective. If purple blisters emerge at the beginning, do not pierce them; take medicine to help them rupture naturally, and it’s best if they break on their own to let out the bloody fluid. If after taking medicine they still do not break, it is acceptable to prick them open with a needle.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a><br>If blisters appear with swelling and pain, apply and take &quot;Wanbing Jiedu Wan&quot; (Ten Thousand Disease Detoxifying Pill). If it forms pus and does not dry up, mix rice vinegar with rust and apply it; it will naturally protrude, and the pus will dry up.</p>
<p>Many have suffered from this without awareness and died suddenly; if you shine a lamp to examine the body, there are small sores all over, indicating &quot;Ding Toxicity.&quot; It is advisable to cauterize where the sores are and wait for recovery; additionally, take &quot;Baidu Yao&quot; (Defeating Toxicity Medicine) and pursue &quot;Ding Duoming Tang&quot; (Ding Life-Retrieving Decoction). For internal Ding symptoms, place &quot;Hua Du Wan&quot; (Transforming Toxicity Pill) on the tongue and allow it to dissolve and produce saliva; alternatively, use one piece of toad venom, or two for serious cases, placing it on the patient&#39;s tongue to dissolve it. After a while, rinse with well water to wash away the toxic saliva.</p>
<p>For those with a tight jaw or issues in the throat, it is advisable to hold toad venom pills or red ink pills in the mouth for a long time and then rinse with well water. It is also recommended to take two pills; after a brief pause, take another two pills, and also consume &quot;Duoming Dan&quot; (Life-Retrieving Pill) or &quot;Xionghuang Wan&quot; (Realgar Pill) to promote urination. Use &quot;Pili Huo Han&quot; (Lightning Fire Sweat) again, then mix with the previous medicine.<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a><br>If there is one initial outbreak, followed by two more, gradually spreading, promptly use an iron tube to pierce the initial one and remove the toxic pus, which will eradicate the evil flesh, thus preventing further spread. Additionally, separately prepare equal parts of oil, snake skin, earth bee nests, and soap tree thorns, and reduce the white ginger by half to make a powder to treat the sore, which is what was previously referred to as the thirty-six boils. </p>
<p>As for the fish navel sores, if the heads are deep and black, when ruptured, yellow fluid will seep out, and frothy fluid will be present around; the toxicity is particularly severe. Utilize the aforementioned method, along with taking antidote pills to clear the heart and circulate the blood.</p>
<p>Treatment methods: For an exterior excess, one should harmonize the exterior using the Jingfang Baidu Powder and Zhuijing Duoming Decoction. At the onset, there will definitely be fever and body aches, indicating that the toxic qi is on the surface, so addressing the exterior will allow the toxins to escape through the pores. </p>
<p>For an internal excess, one should attack the interior using the Jiuling Chuanqing Decoction and Lianqiao Gongli Powder. When the exterior symptoms subside, if the toxic qi enters the interior, causing thirst and constipation, it indicates that the poison is internal, thus attacking the interior will expel it from the organs. </p>
<p>If both the exterior and interior are in excess, one should harmonize the exterior and interior using the Huadu Xiaosheng Powder with additions of purple river horse, single-footed lotus, golden vine, and bitter flower seeds. When the symptoms include fever, body aches, thirst, and constipation, this indicates that both the exterior and interior are involved, necessitating a combination of treatments.<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a><br>If the swelling is pronounced and the pulse is floating and rapid, it is advisable to disperse it with Chan Su Pill or Resurrection Pills. If the toxic force is strong and the pulse is deep and solid, it is advisable to purge it with Death-Defying Pills or Ten Thousand Diseases Detox Pills. If there are no exterior or interior symptoms, after taking dispersing and detoxifying medicines, one should use the Recovery and Qi Circulation Powder with a small amount of musk added. For weak individuals, combine Five Spice Lian Qiao Decoction with Ten Xuan Powder; if slightly weak, use only Ren Shen Bai Du San. Note that the Five Spice Lian Qiao Decoction is a warming, dispersing medicine; for a weak person, it is not suitable. The method of Xue should be employed instead. </p>
<p>To draw out carbuncle poison, use Jin Yin Bai Zhi Powder or Ten Xuan Powder for conditioning; if it is not yet ulcerated, this medicine is unnecessary. If the initial symptoms include chills and fever, or rigidity, or headache, or alternating chills and fever, or heaviness and pain in the limbs, or constipation, it is advisable to take Bai Du San combined with Fang Feng, Jing Jie, Lian Qiao, Huang Qin, Qing Mu Xiang, Jin Yin Hua, Tian Hua Fen, Da Huang, and Sheng Di Huang. If there are no chills but only fever, one may take Jiao Zhang Xiao Du San, Shi Shen San, or Wan Quan San. If the exterior symptoms are resolved but the toxic qi has entered the interior, then Xiong Huang Wan may be used. </p>
<p>For timid and weak individuals, harsh medicines should not be used to attack; instead, it is advisable to apply garlic moxibustion for fifty times and administer several doses of Ren Shen Bai Du San.<a id="trans-293p" href="#orig-293p" class="marker">[293p]</a><br>If one lives in a remote and distant place, severe methods are necessary for the medicinal effect to reach them; if harsh remedies are used, the stomach energy will be harmed first, leading to the inevitable disaster of feeling weak. It is better to use moxibustion. </p>
<p>When a carbuncle’s surrounding redness gradually expands and does not stop spreading, it is called &quot;carbuncle spreading yellow.&quot; One should use &quot;Tongsheng Xiaodu San&quot; to dissipate and promote the flow, followed by regulating with Rhubarb and Alum to achieve recovery. Alternatively, one can also use detoxifying decoctions, which are effective for this condition; this is suitable for treating miasma without error. </p>
<p>For a carbuncle that is swollen and hard, with a rapid and agitated pulse, a preference for coolness, thirst, and constipation, it is advisable to use &quot;Lianqiao Gongli San&quot; for internal attack and spreading, taking it once, then using Chan Su pills. If there is also an exterior evil, add &quot;Jingfang Baidu San,&quot; plus honeysuckle, tianhua fen, rhubarb, and lianqiao; if the pulse is strong with heat, increase Huanglian and Huangqin, or simply add Ku Huazi, which is a marvelous remedy for reducing heat and treating miasma.</p>
<p>If caused by the skinning or cutting of livestock infected by disease, leading to confusion, body coldness, and the presence of purple blisters all over, this is the toxic carbuncle. Immediate moxibustion at the blistered areas is required, which will lead to recovery after a while; then administer &quot;Ren Shen Baidu San&quot; with Fangfeng and Jingjie.<a id="trans-294p" href="#orig-294p" class="marker">[294p]</a><br>If suddenly experiencing severe chills and nausea, numbness in the shoulders and arms, itching in the palms, followed by confusion and unawareness, and producing a boil, this indicates a toxic boil. Urgently apply moxibustion fifty times to revive; if aware of pain, apply another fifty times and then take Jingfang Baidu Powder to recover. The ancients claimed that sudden death is often caused by toxic boils. Swiftly use a lamp to inspect the whole body; if any small sores or purple blisters appear abnormal, treat them urgently with moxibustion. However, only those with warmth in the chest and abdomen can be saved.</p>
<p>If death is caused by the poison of zhang, from cutting or eating the flesh of contaminated cattle, horses, pigs, or sheep, leading to toxic boils either on the limbs, head, chest, abdomen, sides, back, or groin, with purple blisters or lumps, swelling pain, fever, restlessness, headache, body aches, and joint pain, first use Tianma Duoming Dan; then use Sishen Wan, Jiedu Xiaozhang Powder; next try Qishen Powder, followed by Wandan Jiedu Wan, and Jiezhang Xiaodu Powder, combined with Zhu Mo Wan and Quzhang Powder. Additionally, frequently take a decoction of Mao Shi Ti gen, or a decoction of Xianren Shu gen, and if not hot, take with wine. If high fever persists, it is advisable to use a cooling and detoxifying drink.<a id="trans-295p" href="#orig-295p" class="marker">[295p]</a><br>You should use a moxa stick to contain the poisonous vapors, preventing them from dispersing. Then, wash the area with a cleansing powder, followed by applying an ointment. If sores develop, use the powder to treat them and apply a plaster. </p>
<p>If you have carbuncles, initially you may not feel anything and have not yet used the previous methods to induce sweating. After several days, the external symptoms may subside; however, they may swell in the chest or abdomen, caused by toxic gases entering the body. Use the Thunder Fire treatment for this. If taking Angelica powder does not resolve the external symptoms, quickly apply the Thunder Fire dispersal treatment. </p>
<p>If the carbuncle appears between the ribs, with the toxic vapors aiming towards the heart, this is a critical condition. You should urgently apply moxa to the tip of the sore for three to five rounds and also needle around the moxa points to cause slight bleeding. If blisters form around the moxa-treated area, it is a good sign; if not, it is ominous. </p>
<p>If the carbuncle is in a soft and difficult-to-reach area, do not use a needle; only use the pine needle method to cut the red silk path. If it occurs between the hips, with toxic gases targeting the kidneys, use the pine needle method to cut off the red silk path at the ends of both hips to induce bleeding. If it appears on the head or face, needle at the end of the red silk path at the neck to induce bleeding.<a id="trans-296p" href="#orig-296p" class="marker">[296p]</a><br>If the red thread pathways are not visible in various locations, one can also employ the method of acupuncture with pine needles. The use of pine needles arises from the invisibility of the red thread pathways, where no needles can be inserted. Therefore, this method is applied to the soft and empty areas beneath the neck, under the ribs, and in the armpits, breaking the red thread pathways to prevent toxic energies from attacking the heart and kidneys. </p>
<p>If the hands and feet are cold and all six vessels are absent, this indicates that the toxic energy has penetrated deeply, and the vital energy and blood are overwhelmed by the toxins, preventing circulation, hence the body feels cold and the pulse cannot be felt. One should take Wood Fragrance Flowing Qi Decoction several times to restore the flow of vital energy and blood, allowing the pulse to return. Then, one should treat according to the established methods, ensuring success.</p>
<p>The symptoms of internal boils are similar to those of external boils: there may be fever and chills, headache and body pain, yet the sore does not manifest visibly. After a few days, there may be swelling in one area of the chest, back, abdomen, sides, head, or limbs—that indicates where the internal boil has developed. One should urgently use the Thunder Fire method as previously described without protecting the sweating area on the swollen part. If there are chills and fever in the body, even if swelling has not yet developed, but there is severe abdominal pain, one must treat it as an internal boil using the subsequent methods; do not delay!</p>
<p>For treating internal boils, toad venom should be used at the appropriate time, mixed with small amounts of mulberry leaves, and ground together into pills the size of pearls, dried in the shade for use.<a id="trans-297p" href="#orig-297p" class="marker">[297p]</a><br><strong>On the Causes of Boils and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Why do boils and abscesses appear on the back? A healthy body manifests such forms. Those without illness in the world have a balance of water and fire, and their essence and blood are abundant. The &quot;Nourishing Life&quot; chapter states: Do not shake your essence, do not wear out your body; by returning to a tranquil mind and silence, one can achieve longevity. All this leads one away from worldly matters, forgetting fame and profit, and relinquishing greed and anger, thus avoiding illness. This is something only those who cultivate themselves to preserve life can achieve; how can modern people compare? It is said that tranquility generates water, while activity generates fire. Water nurtures all things, while fire can overcome all things; therefore, all diseases arise from fire. Once fire arises, the seven emotions and six desires are similarly affected. After they enter, various diseases manifest. Internally, they cause issues like wind disturbance, phlegm, and internal injuries; externally, they result in boils and abscesses on the back or sores on the mouth. This summarizes the main ideas.<a id="trans-298p" href="#orig-298p" class="marker">[298p]</a><br>Thus, the formation of carbuncles is due to obstruction; the poison from the six bowels surges outward, appearing suddenly with superficial ailments, because the cause of illness is derived from the yang aspect. Yang energy is light and clear, rising high and floating, which makes it easy to swell, form pus, decay, and heal, indeed leading to conditions that do not harm the tendons and bones, and are easy to treat. In contrast, abscesses are about stagnation, relating to the yin and affecting the five organs, with poison attacking from within, resulting in gradual onset and deep-seated ailments, because the yin blood is heavy and turbid, tending to sink, thus leading to conditions that harm tendons and bones, making them hard to treat. Generally, in the young, strong qi and blood can conquer poison, while in the elderly, poison can overpower qi and blood, making conditions perilous. The treatment methods are detailed in the second discussion, which should be looked at carefully.</p>
<p>Internally, the seven emotions can affect the organs; worry and overthinking are closely related to the heart. </p>
<p>Note: The seven emotions and six desires are all thieves of one&#39;s original energy. Those who can avoid these will generally enjoy peace and longevity; those who become attached to them will inevitably experience harm and loss.<a id="trans-299p" href="#orig-299p" class="marker">[299p]</a><br>But very few people can truly savor this! The movements of emotions and desires know no boundaries; they can affect anyone in various ways. Thus, joy injures the heart, anger harms the liver, worry weakens the lungs, thinking affects the spleen, sadness harms the spirit, fear injures the kidneys, and shock affects the gallbladder. These seven emotions all deplete the vital energy of a person. As for the six desires—hearing sounds, seeing sights, smelling scents, tasting flavors, the heart encompassing the universe, and the mind encompassing all things—these six desires all damage the true essence of a person across three lifetimes. Furthermore, they are the source of suffering, illness, pain, and various ailments and diseases. All these arise from emotions and desires. Medical practitioners should examine this carefully with patients! Additionally, the six excesses harm vital energy and blood, as wind, cold, heat, dampness, and fire assail the body.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a><br>The winds of the four seasons bring imbalanced and violent energies that can severely affect people. Cold arises from irregular seasonal conditions, fierce winds, torrential rains, and icy winters, or from consuming excessively cold foods; heat results from intense sunlight and scorching days, resulting in humid heat that overwhelms the body; dampness comes from prolonged exposure to damp and low environments, or from sudden exposure to wind and rain, leading to an invasion of moisture; dryness occurs due to inner heat from insufficient yin, consuming bodily fluids and failing to nourish the organs, resulting in dry skin and constipation; fire arises from disturbed emotions, consumption of rich foods and strong drinks, or from unregulated desires. These six harmful influences all enter from the outside. For those with a strong constitution, there may be instances where they are unaffected by these influences; however, for those with weak constitutions, they are often susceptible. There are also cases where one may experience these influences without immediate effect, with pathogenic energies lodged in the organs, channels, and joints for a long time, either resulting in internal damage or triggered by external pathogenic factors. After symptoms appear, one should consider the balance of cold and heat and the interplay of pathogenic and righteous energies for treatment. Rich and extravagant foods, when consumed excessively, can deplete yin due to overexertion in desires. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Gao liang&quot; refers to rich and sumptuous foods such as fine wines and richly prepared meats.)<a id="trans-301p" href="#orig-301p" class="marker">[301p]</a><br>In those times, many people would use charcoal to smoke food, or cook it in oil and fat, resulting in flavors that are fragrant, dry, sweet, salty, sour, and sometimes spicy. They also resorted to heavy ingredients for pickling and cooking rich broths to achieve a refreshing taste, without caring about the negative effects on their bodies. Furthermore, they indulged in the company of favored concubines, feeling spiritually uplifted, surrounded by warm beds and the heat of the stove. Often, they would eat before feeling hungry and indulge in food before it cooled, seeking immediate pleasure without regard for moderation; if something was slightly insufficient in flavor, they would seek stimulation, focusing solely on fleeting enjoyment without realizing the depletion of their vitality over time. With those who suffer from ailments, these issues do not stem from simple foods, but rather from rich and fatty diets. Who understands that the taste of rich foods is fleeting, inferior to that of simple grains and vegetables? Thus, those who know their limits should avoid such indulgences and choose wisely when they do indulge. Consequently, the imbalance of the internal organs leads to a natural disorder in the six bowels.<a id="trans-302p" href="#orig-302p" class="marker">[302p]</a><br>The five organs correspond to the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They are typically in a harmonious cycle of generation, as when wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, and water generates wood. When these five organs are in harmony and generating each other, how could illness arise? Thus, when sickness occurs, the five organs must be in conflict and counteracting each other; that is to say, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, and metal overcomes wood. This mutual punishment and conflict among the five organs leads to changes and transformations, resulting in illness. It is said that what generates is prosperous, while what counteracts leads to demise. This indeed reflects the fundamental principle of the generation and overcoming of all things, not limited to the discussion of diseases. Furthermore, if the five organs are not in harmony, the six bowels will not function properly; if the six bowels do not function, the nine orifices will become weak and unwell; and if the nine orifices become weak and unwell, it will result in abscesses. This indicates that abscesses and sores arise from the improper functioning of the organs and bowels, leading to an inability to express and release properly.<a id="trans-303p" href="#orig-303p" class="marker">[303p]</a><br>For ailments caused by cold evil leading to pain, warm and disperse it; for swelling and intense pain due to dampness, let it drain; for dryness causing cramping pain, nourish and moisten it; for pain from diarrhea, warm it; for pain due to obstruction, unblock it; for pain from deficiency, tonify it; for pain from excess, purge it; for disharmony of yin and yang, adjust it; for secret blockages in the meridians, harmonize it; for painful swelling with pus, open it; for flesh-eating sores, remove them; for pain from overwork, allow for rest; for pain from injury, restore it. These methods are all vital practices, and it is necessary for the practitioner to understand them well.</p>
<p>When issues arise from the heart, they are often dangerous, and matters concerning the five organs can be clarified. Note: the five organs refer to the heart, liver, spleen, and lungs, all of which are linked to the back, while the kidney is located below on its own. Although it is positioned below, its essence, fluids, and vital energy nourish and flow upward. Thus, the fire of the four organs relies on the water of the one organ for support. The notion that the five organs are fundamentally linked to the back encompasses this meaning. All instances of abscess and sores have been preceded by damage to the five organs before manifesting.<a id="trans-304p" href="#orig-304p" class="marker">[304p]</a><br>The back is governed by the Bladder channel of the Taiyang (Sun) meridian, which is the leader of the six meridians, and the Governing Vessel, which is the principal vessel of the twelve channels. This is why sores appear on the back and toxins attack this area. Moreover, the heart occupies the sovereign position; how can it allow toxins to invade? Any condition arising from here often leads to serious and difficult-to-treat symptoms, so practitioners must be cautious and observant!</p>
<p>Conditions below the heart tend to be milder, and those of the six bowels might be lighter as well. (Note: Sores arising from below the heart, except for the kidney shu point, are generally milder. The six bowels refer to the Stomach meridian of the Foot Yangming, the Small Intestine meridian of the Hand Taiyang, the Bladder meridian of the Foot Taiyang, and the Pericardium meridian of the Hand Jueyin: according to the “Xian Shu,” the six bowel meridians include the Large Intestine meridian of the Hand Yangming, but not the Pericardium meridian. The three Jueyin and Gallbladder meridians of the Foot Shaoyang are also involved. Although these meridians are classified as bowels and their energy governs the exterior, their diseases manifest as sores. Therefore, illnesses arising from the five zang organs are considered severe, while those from the six bowels are seen as light. This illustrates the distinction in severity between the internal organs and bowels.) The spleen accumulates toxins that result in shoulder and back issues.<a id="trans-305p" href="#orig-305p" class="marker">[305p]</a><br>The condition occurring below the shoulder and above the spine is caused by toxic accumulation from rich foods. If the swelling is distinctly raised and stands no more than the width of the shoulders, it is considered advantageous. First, it is important to detoxify and protect the heart, followed by clearing away the heat from within. One may intermittently use wax alum pills and heart-protecting powders to defend against toxicity affecting the heart. If the swelling is flat and hard, gradually enlarging and opening, attacking both shoulders and the chest, or if the swelling is irregular, this indicates a serious condition.</p>
<p>Regarding the heart&#39;s fire toxicity: when the heart exhibits symptoms, it is due to excessive heat arising from the heart&#39;s fire. Moreover, as the heart governs the body, heat accumulates throughout and converges here, resulting in problems. This condition is colloquially referred to as the toxic disturbance at the sovereign point, which is most harmful, blocking the governing vessels and causing significant harm. As this area of the spine has many indentations, it is difficult to manifest; the ulcers appear depressed, and the swelling is neither high nor pointed. Treatment must focus on significantly reducing heart fire and urgently dispersing the accumulated heat. Acupuncture should be applied to achieve unblocking, and various extraction methods must ensure that toxic gases are expelled from both inside and outside, thus preventing internal attacks, which would be effective. </p>
<p>If, after fifteen days, there are no changes and pus is produced, it indicates resolution. If, however, changes occur with the swelling becoming harder and larger without producing pus, prognosis is poor, with death likely occurring around the twenty-second day. This condition is particularly urgent and values early treatment, with a 30% to 40% chance of recovery if addressed promptly.<a id="trans-306p" href="#orig-306p" class="marker">[306p]</a><br>Two lumps arise symmetrically from both shoulders, associated with lung and liver, manifesting without false names. </p>
<p>(Note: The left corresponds to the liver, and the right to the lung. Conditions arising from the movement of the shoulder bones can be treated. Ancient texts say left intertwines with the right, and the right with the left, both difficult to treat, though I disagree. Every physician who sees this intertwining has never observed death, so long as the treatment method is appropriate. Begin treatment with universal pills to induce sweating, smoothing the internal and external pathways; then apply liver-clearing and stagnation-resolving decoctions, using the Four Gentlemen Decoction for Qi and the Four Substance Decoction for blood, and later the Eight Treasures Decoction alongside the Six Stagnation Decoction for proper adjustment. This approach is indeed sound. However, this condition originally arises from phlegm-accumulated Qi-stagnation and liver fire stagnation, causing disharmony in Qi and blood. The principle is to open what is blocked, and to move what is stagnant. If one uses detoxifying and Qi-releasing remedies indiscriminately, or relies solely on tonics, it will lead to numerous dangers.)</p>
<p>Lotus seeds resembling beehives prevent toxic falls. </p>
<p>(Note: The beehive-like lotus seeds grow mostly on the back, close to the heart, and are level with the spine. If mild, the condition is long, swollen, or may be asymmetrical; if severe, the appearance is sloped and flat, injuring both sides. The holes resemble a beehive, protruding like lotus seeds. The ulcer&#39;s form can be alarming, often producing numerous risks; the elderly and weak cannot endure it, thus needing a stable approach. The main concern is purity of Yang. Treatment methods need not be anxious about the ulcer&#39;s severity. Safeguard the heart and membranes, and adjust the pills. Be mindful of the medicine and formula; the effectiveness relies on the physician&#39;s intention. Comprehensive treatment discourse is critical for survival and demise.) </p>
<p>Difficult conditions arise from the kidney region at the waist.<a id="trans-307p" href="#orig-307p" class="marker">[307p]</a><br><strong>Commentary:</strong> The area known as &quot;Shen Shu&quot; is located between the two loins, within the flesh surrounding the kidneys, and can also appear at the center. Conditions arising from this area are particularly dire. This is because the inner kidney is the root of life, storing essence, vital energy, and spirit. It is also said to be responsible for the innate fate, nurturing both men and women, and supporting longevity. All these functions originate from the kidney.</p>
<p><strong>Disease Cause:</strong> The illness is often a result of excessive sexual activity, leading to depletion of energy and damage to essence. This results in fiery desires consuming the yin, while external yang influences create disturbances, ultimately depleting the true water and true yin. Once depleted, the organs become deficient, allowing various pathogenic fires and influences to enter. After entering, these can coalesce into sores. If the primary organ has some true yin to restrain the fire, the sores may appear red, active, swollen, and pus-filled. Treatment should involve Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang, along with additions of Shan Yu, Wu Wei Zi, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu, as well as variations of Ba Wei Wan to replenish the source.</p>
<p>If the sores are purple-black, dry, hard, and do not produce pus, this indicates internal failure of true yin, with no hope for recovery, likely leading to death within about fifteen days.</p>
<p><strong>Dū Mài:</strong> The governing vessel becomes deficient, manifesting at the nape of the neck, commonly referred to as “Dui Kou” (opposing mouth).</p>
<p><strong>Commentary:</strong> &quot;Dui Kou&quot; refers to a condition occurring at the back of the neck, opposite the front mouth, although there are differences in orientation.<a id="trans-308p" href="#orig-308p" class="marker">[308p]</a><br>The condition arising from the “zheng” (正) is attributed to the governor vessel (督脉), while the condition arising from the “pian” (偏) is related to the taiyang bladder (太阳膀胱). Both types stem from the upward attack of damp heat, which cause obstruction and accumulation. The governor vessel can easily treat sores despite being classified as “zheng,” because it originates from below and runs along the spine above, allowing the toxic qi to confront the swelling, preventing malevolent toxins from descending and resulting in external eruptions, making it easier to treat. In contrast, sores related to the bladder are difficult to treat, even though they are categorized as “pian.” This is because the bladder meridian begins at the crown and travels down the sides of the neck, flowing downward and merging with the toxic sores, resulting in many flat and collapsed sores. Moreover, the taiyang bladder governs cold waters, which are characterized by coolness and heaviness; thus, its sores are often difficult to swell, their color difficult to appear red and vibrant, they are rigid and hard to ulcerate, and may easily cause swelling around the shoulders and neck. If there is no pus after fifteen days, it will definitely turn black and enter the realm of yin, leading to a high rate of untreatability. It is a common misconception to consider “zheng” as serious and “pian” as minor, which stems from ignorance. The treatment should focus on Huanglian Xiaodu Decoction, while the rest should aim to clear fire, transform phlegm, detoxify, and calm the heart, with the elimination of obstruction being crucial. </p>
<p>Unexpectedly, numerous sores can arise behind the ears, as the sharp toxicity can indeed be grave. </p>
<p>(Note: The dangerous region defined as being one inch and three-tenths behind the ear is surely a perilous sign.)<a id="trans-309p" href="#orig-309p" class="marker">[309p]</a><br>Again, the left side represents &quot;yaojun&quot; (a type of ulcer), and the right side represents &quot;ruidu&quot; (sharp poison). &quot;Yao&quot; refers to things that are unnatural, hence belongs to the liver wood; &quot;rui&quot; refers to sharp instruments, hence belongs to the lung metal. Both arise from excessive thoughts and mental strain, indecisiveness leading to an excess of fire and stagnation, which in turn leads to this sickness. Therefore, the body tends to be hard, the head often concealed, blackened before rupture, rotting before pus forms, foul odors easily arise, vital energy easily declines, and poisonous gas tends to be internalized rather than expressed outwardly, ultimately leading to internal attack and death. However, this condition initially arises subtly, making people largely unaware; when they do become aware, the poison has already entered within. If it manifests as red, swollen, and easily pus-forming or rotting, it poses no issue.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are cases of &quot;tuoju&quot; (a type of necrosis occurring in hands and feet), resulting from the roots of supplements gone awry. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Tuoju&quot; refers to loss, while &quot;ju&quot; means black and rotting. This poison arises from the excessive use of medicinal stones, elixirs, and secret techniques that invigorate yang and thicken essence, leading to a desire not to release. The medicine acts violently, whether through washing, chewing, holding in the mouth, or hiding below the navel, blocking the pathways of essence. If not weakened over time, this brings momentary pleasure but ultimately leads to harm, accumulating toxins in the organs, drying and burning the true yin, creating calamity in the body, which must eventually manifest. This is the root cause, and when it manifests, it is difficult to treat. It frequently affects the hands and feet, attacking the bones and ligaments.)<a id="trans-310p" href="#orig-310p" class="marker">[310p]</a><br>At birth, it resembles millet, with a color like jujubes in shape, gradually expanding and growing, with sinews and bones left vulnerable. Dark and black, it painfully cuts the heart; lingering and decaying, foul air suffocates people. Extending to the ankle bone, life is about to falter; this is not fate but rather the result of self-destruction. The ancients had methods; severance could promote life, but who today is willing to cut for the sake of reputation? Though there are treatment methods, details will follow.</p>
<p>General swelling is hard to treat, while burning swelling is easier; an overview of the methods in between can be relied upon. Other sores should be categorized and discussed separately; how can one carelessly mess with these presentations?</p>
<p>(Note: General swelling refers to swollen flesh without sore swelling; burning swelling refers to sore swelling without swollen flesh. These two types represent the fundamental issues with sores and highlight the key points of distinguishing symptoms and conditions. From this perspective, a decisive determination can be made. Initially, treatments should promote upward recovery; post-breakdown, internal remedies should not be used but rather topical medications; if unresponsive, it indicates toxic tendencies overwhelming qi and blood, resulting in death within ten days. If the sore has breached but does not ulcerate, with a hard root, or if it is soft and spreads, urgent application of supportive medications to greatly strengthen the spleen and stomach is necessary; failing to respond may lead to death within twenty days. If the ulcer is fully broken but does not change to a bright red or show signs of healing, with an enlarging sore mouth, persistence of swelling and pain, and no recovery of stomach qi, urgent and strong reinforcements are necessary; lack of response indicates spleen collapse, resulting in death within a month.)<a id="trans-311p" href="#orig-311p" class="marker">[311p]</a><br>Treatise on Methods, General Overview, Part Two</p>
<p>How should we treat carbuncles and sores that appear on the back? Regardless of yin or yang, first apply moxibustion. If there is no pain, apply moxibustion until there is pain; if there is tenderness, treat it when it is not tender.</p>
<p>(Note: When examining large sores, one must first calmly establish a firm decision. Start from the visible date of onset and count the days to see if the shape of the sore corresponds with the time. A match indicates a better prognosis, while a mismatch suggests greater danger. Next, investigate the source of the illness: which organ it stems from and what part of the body is affected. Consider the vertical alignment of the body, whether the affected area is safe or hazardous, discern the colors and forms, and analyze the spirit&#39;s presence or absence. Also take into account the age—whether old or young—and the state of qi and blood, whether they are strong or weak, if it involves yang or yin, and the depth of toxicity. Generally, those with yang conditions are easier to treat, while those with yin are more difficult to manage. </p>
<p>Examine the pulse for its fullness or emptiness to ascertain good or bad outcomes, thus deciding on the final approach. Before a sore breaks, the pulse should exceed normal by one or two beats; after it breaks, it should be less by two or three beats. This reflects the disease&#39;s pulse correlation, which remains consistent. If the opposite occurs, be wary of unforeseen complications. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the method depends on the precision of observation and the heart&#39;s correspondence, meticulously considering each detail, ensuring clarity in both internal and external aspects, before determining the treatment. If the sore has not formed within seven days, the vital energy remains strong; regardless of yin or yang, external or internal conditions, cold or heat, emptiness or fullness, moxibustion should be applied first.<a id="trans-312p" href="#orig-312p" class="marker">[312p]</a><br>The light symptoms allow the poisonous gas to disperse with the fire, while the severe symptoms draw out the accumulated toxins, penetrating internally and externally. When the evil combines with fire and the poisonous gas mixes with the Yang, swelling and pain may then arise, leading to sweating or attacking the illness. Treatment may involve either dissipating or uplifting, seeking to address both the symptoms and the root cause, and must ensure that the pulse aligns with the medicine, and the medicine aligns with the illness. Healing in this manner will naturally be error-free. Therefore, the prescription of medicine is difficult and relies entirely on active methods; generally, both beginning and end must not harm the vital energy, specifically the spleen and stomach! </p>
<p>Internally, take a dose of toad venom pill, and externally use divine fire to illuminate three branches. </p>
<p>Note: For sores that have just begun, within seven days, or after cauterization without other medications, it is advisable to take one dose of toad venom pill to induce sweating, or the Universal Elixir may also induce sweating. The so-called poisonous gas disperses with sweat, which is the most effective method. If, after taking the two medicines, sweating does not occur, it is due to the closure of both surface and interior; the poison is not light, and careful extraction must be applied. The method of illuminating with divine light is indeed marvelous, but it should not be used too early. If the sore is between four to five days and the shape has not yet formed, and the poison has not yet emerged, applying it too early may leave the accumulation and the internal poison may difficultly emerge. It must be used after eight or nine days, when the sore situation is established, and the poisonous gas has gathered, but has not yet turned to pus or rot. Illuminating at this stage can lead to self-healing of the matured parts, self-dissolution of the unformed, self-suppuration of the intact, and self-dislodgement of the adhered parts, while also able to detoxify, activate blood circulation, reduce swelling, and disperse clots, which is indeed an excellent method. </p>
<p>Apply ointment on top, surrounding the edges with medication.<a id="trans-313p" href="#orig-313p" class="marker">[313p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> For sores, the greatest concern is the invasion of wind and cold. When they first appear, or after cauterization, one should apply Taiyi Ointment on the top. Its effectiveness lies in drawing out toxins, raising the pus, and preventing wind and cold from entering. If there is pain and swelling in a yang sore, after seven days the sore will naturally have yellow, thick pus adhering to the ointment, with surrounding swelling that is red, bright, and vivid. Each day, one should wash it clean with scallion soup and replace the ointment. The proper pus will generally emerge around the eleventh day, which is a sign of easy treatment and tranquility. If after seven days the sore does not swell high and large, the edges are not painful, and there is no sign of pus adhering to the sore, this indicates balance between yin and yang. In such cases, one should use Huafu Zihua Ointment to apply on the sore and cover it with a plaster. Once past the tenth day, if the sore top begins to decay and the surrounding swelling increases, resembling the appearance of pus, the proper pus will only emerge after the fifteenth day, which is a sign that danger is likely to turn into stability.<a id="trans-314p" href="#orig-314p" class="marker">[314p]</a><br>As for those without pus after the twentieth day, it is a pure yin condition, and even treatment will be ineffective. Furthermore, if the edges of the wound show lingering swelling, the key is to apply medicine to bind the base, so as to prevent it from expanding. Initially, it is advisable to use Jinhuang San to apply around the edges, as it helps to draw out toxins, reduce swelling, and alleviate pain. Once the wound has ruptured, one should use iron barrel ointment to bind it, so that the root of the wound gradually tightens. However, various wounds arise from stagnation of qi and blood, and one must not solely use cooling medicines, as they can cause the tissues to harden and complicate healing. It is essential to use medications that disperse stagnation, promote blood flow, and eliminate toxins, as this is the proper approach. </p>
<p>When qi is abundant, the top naturally rises and protrudes; when blood is abundant, the foundation is tight and firm without doubt. </p>
<p>(Note: Qi and blood are fundamental aspects of human constitution; older individuals may have an excess, while younger individuals may be deficient. The vitality of the body relies on these; any imbalance may lead to numerous ailments, especially significant in the realm of wounds.)<a id="trans-315p" href="#orig-315p" class="marker">[315p]</a><br>When a swelling sore arises, if there is no vital energy to push through, the sore will not be able to form a high bulge, nor will it become painfully inflamed or rupture to release pus. If there is no true yin to provide nourishment, the root of the sore cannot be restrained, and its color will not be able to live and gather. In observing whether the top of the sore is high and the root alive, regardless of age, it is clear that there is an abundance of vital energy and blood; thus, both the young and the old may be untroubled. </p>
<p>It is also important to understand the junction clearly. The junction refers to the place where the root of the sore meets healthy flesh; the heights and depths naturally distinguish themselves. The form of the sore and that of the healthy tissue are not mixed; thus, they are distinct. From this perspective, it becomes clear. </p>
<p>For those that rise high and swollen, it is inadvisable to use aggressive medications that damage the vital energy; for those that are flat and diffuse, it is better to use tonics and supportive medicines to enrich them. </p>
<p>[Note: Generally, when a sore first appears and naturally rises, this sore belongs to the category of yang conditions and the internal organs do not harbor deep poison; moreover, the poison emerges on the surface, hence it is advisable to promote the expulsion to expedite the pus.]<a id="trans-316p" href="#orig-316p" class="marker">[316p]</a><br>Avoid using internal消 (dissolving) and攻伐 (attacking) medicines as they can harm the spleen energy; doing so makes it difficult for pus to form and often prevents proper resolution. If a sore initially appears low and flat, without redness, this indicates that the original energy is weak. It is urgent to use warming and spleen-strengthening herbs to help expel the toxic energy outward, so as to avoid any complications.</p>
<p>For those with severe internal heat, increase the dosage of detoxifying and clearing agents; for those with constipation and dryness, it is essential to ensure that treatment is appropriate to promote bowel movements. When the organs and bowels are unblocked, the qi and blood will flow smoothly.</p>
<p>Note: In cases of swollen sores accompanied by internal heat, dry mouth, a firm pulse, and constipation with a preference for cold, this indicates the presence of pathogenic toxins internally. It is crucial to use cold and cooling agents for relief, such as Huanglian Decoction, Sishun Cool Drink, or Woxue Decoction, which can all be chosen for use. If there are also symptoms on the exterior, use Fang Feng Tong Sheng Powder minus Ma Huang, or Shuang Jie Powder with added Jie Geng and Tian Hua Fen. If there is also difficulty with urination, consider adding Tian Shui San or Wu Ling San; all can be combined to ensure smooth urination and bowel movements, thereby addressing the root cause.<a id="trans-317p" href="#orig-317p" class="marker">[317p]</a><br>If there is a deficiency of vital energy, one may fear that the previous medicine is insufficient. In such cases, one can use a decoction to dispel toxins, adding honey-fried rhubarb, or possibly combine it with the method involving pig bile, which can also facilitate passage. It is crucial that the treatment promotes movement without leading to leakage, achieving a balance within the organs, ensuring clarity both internally and externally, before using medicines that aid in expelling pus and supplementing internally. </p>
<p>In cases of ulcers, even if one experiences dry mouth and constipation, with signs of disharmony in the organs like difficulty in urination, this is due to excessive pus and fluid loss after a rupture, leading to depletion of fluids and exhaustion of qi and blood, which fails to nourish the organs. Such patients will typically have a subtle and rapid pulse, a dry mouth, and reduced appetite, preferring hot soups. This indicates a disease caused by the fire of deficient yang, which is different from the previously discussed excess; thus, one should focus on nourishing qi and blood, replenishing fluids, harmonizing the organs, and regulating the spleen and stomach. </p>
<p>By treating in this manner, both urination and defecation will normalize, and the risk of complications will be minimized. There are often cases where aggressive purging leads to dire consequences.<a id="trans-318p" href="#orig-318p" class="marker">[318p]</a><br>Within ten days, if the wound remains firm, a beryllium needle must be used to pierce the top. </p>
<p>Note: Any wound after ten days should naturally rot and purulent; if after this period it remains hard, it indicates a balance of yin and yang. This suggests that the root of the wound is deeply embedded. If the needle is not inserted a short distance to open a vent and release the toxic gas, it will inevitably lead to internal damage. If there is pus inside, it should be made easy to discharge; this is akin to opening a door to chase away thieves. </p>
<p>Moreover, if after ten days the wound does not rot but remains red, hot, swollen, and painful, although the pus is delayed, it will eventually emerge without needing to be pricked. This is because the vital energy cannot be sufficient or there is a lack of nutrient medicine, possibly aggravated by the use of cold treatments, or if it has been covered without warming, all of which contribute to delayed pus formation. Those with this condition should use tonifying, spleen-strengthening medicine to nurture and promote the pus. </p>
<p>It is advised to consider a period of fifteen to twenty-one days; beyond this, even if there is scant pus, the vital energy might reject the poison, and over time it will lead to depletion, making it indeed difficult to resolve.<a id="trans-319p" href="#orig-319p" class="marker">[319p]</a><br>After half a month, if the pus is also reduced, one must remove the medicine tube by pulling it out straight. If there is a combination of pus and blood that is sticky, it will certainly facilitate the detachment of rotten flesh. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the wound has not rotted or perforated after half a month and does not produce pus, the poison must have infiltrated, and one should urgently use a beryllium needle. The needle should be slightly opened at the tip to create three holes, and can be inserted according to the depth of the wound, about an inch or two. Inserting the needle does not cause pain, and deeper insertion is permissible. After the top of the medicine tube has been boiled, align it with the openings of the wound and let it sit for a long time to warm before removing it. </p>
<p>When the object is pulled out, the blood should be bright red with a slight purplish hue, and the pus should be yellow with a fresh appearance; this indicates that the blood and energy are circulating in the active sore, and the person is likely to survive. However, if the extracted bruised blood is dark purple and discolored, looking foul and watery without pus, this indicates the presence of internal decay and death in the sore. This is referred to as energy failure and blood depletion, which is lamented by immortals! Such sores are difficult to wait for, and the person is likely to perish by the end of the month.<a id="trans-320p" href="#orig-320p" class="marker">[320p]</a><br>At this time, if there is pus that cannot be expelled, use a needle to hook out the stubborn flesh at the surface. Then, with a knife, cut open about an inch at the original site to allow the pus duct to flow freely, so that the sore does not become blocked. </p>
<p>(Note: After using a syringe to draw out the pus, there is already a hole on the outside, and the internal passage should also be clear. When the sore is in the process of pus discharge, if there is still little pus, it can be inferred that the sore has clotted and decayed, blocking the inner flesh, and the stubborn membrane may obstruct, making it difficult for the pus duct to open. You must use a needle to hook up the stubborn flesh at the sore top, and with a sharp pair of scissors, gradually remove about an inch of hard flesh. Removing it may cause mild pain and slight bleeding, but this is not a problem. Using both hands with appropriate pressure, start from the root of the sore and gently press toward the middle, removing the pus duct where it has accumulated. Pus should then naturally flow out, with yellow and thick being a good sign. An increase in pus over time is favorable; the opposite indicates a bad outcome. Ensure that any blockage is cleared to allow the purulent toxins to discharge.)</p>
<p>Frequently wash with broth and avoid exposure to the wind.<a id="trans-321p" href="#orig-321p" class="marker">[321p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Before a sore has burst, or after medicinal treatment has begun, one must prepare a decoction of scallions and mugwort. This should be used to wash the sore once a day, or even twice if the situation is severe, in order to promote the circulation of blood and qi, facilitating the process of bursting. When the sore has burst or after the use of a medicinal tube, it is especially important to avoid the wind. Remove any old medicine, and place a round plate under the sore for support. Use pig trotter broth to soak a soft cloth, then apply it to the sore, letting it enter the opening. Gently press out the internal pus, so that the necrotic matter and stagnant pus can exit along with the broth for cleanliness.</p>
<p>Next, take a soft cloth folded into seven or eight layers, ensuring it does not dry out, and cover the sore with it. Gently press with both hands in a circular motion for a while. Once the cloth warms up, change it. Repeat this washing and pressing four to five times to ensure the circulation of blood and qi, allowing the patient to naturally feel at ease. This will resolve any congestion, release toxins, detach rotten flesh, and alleviate pain. This method is essential for treating large sores and cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Once the necrotic tissue has detached and fresh red flesh is visible, wash and then apply jade red ointment. Use a spatula to scoop the ointment into your palm and gently dab it onto the new and old flesh. Then, cover it with Taiyi ointment. If the edges of the sore have healed, there is no need to bind it with medicine. Continue this process daily, and within a few days, the pus and necrotic tissue will be completely eliminated, and new flesh will rapidly grow. With appropriate internal nourishment and regulation, minor sores heal in about a month, while major sores require no more than seventy days to fully close and heal. </p>
<p>The joints are critical at this stage, as changes occur during this process.<a id="trans-322p" href="#orig-322p" class="marker">[322p]</a><br>The period for yang sores is set at fourteen days, while for yin sores it is twenty-one days. At this time, it is crucial to prompt the discharge of pus; when pus is discharged, decay resolves, decay resolves and flesh grows, flesh grows and contraction occurs, contraction occurs and the sore heals, and this follows a certain sequence. If, by the designated time, pus does not emerge, it will lead to subsequent changes. Thus, if the first stage is smooth, later stages will also be smooth; if the first stage is obstructed, later stages will also encounter obstructions.</p>
<p>The treatment should heavily focus on supplementation to achieve complete contraction; one should strictly avoid cold and cool treatments that may result in adverse conditions. After a sore has ruptured, there is often damage to the internal organs, and the qi and blood are significantly deficient. Although the external form may appear sufficient, the internal organs are actually lacking. Therefore, the treatment should be purely restorative to avoid complications.<a id="trans-323p" href="#orig-323p" class="marker">[323p]</a><br>If one observes signs of fever and aversion to cold when the body is exhausted, with a lot of pus and pain from sweating, then one should administer the Ten Great Tonifying Decoction. If there are symptoms of deficiency heat, little sleep, and lack of appetite, then one should give the Astragalus and Ginseng Decoction. If there are chills on the skin and heat in the bones, along with coughing and phlegm, then one should use the Clear the Interior Decoction. If there are symptoms of fatigue in the limbs, emaciation, a pale complexion, and shortness of breath, then one should administer the Ginseng Nourishing Decoction. If there is a lot of pus, restlessness, little appetite, and insomnia, one should use the Sacred Recovery Decoction. If there is a deficiency in the spleen and weak qi, accompanied by coolness of the body, weak pulse, and loose stools, then one should administer the Warm the Interior Decoction. If there is a lack of appetite with nausea and vomiting, then one should use the Fragrant Pepper and Six Gentlemen Decoction. If there is a sinking of the spleen, reduced food intake, and intermittent deficiency heat, one should administer the Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction. If there are signs of kidney deficiency with thirst, and an inability to restrain the heart fire, one should give the Modified Eight Ingredients Pill, and choose accordingly.</p>
<p>For the nourishing process is essential, as it builds qi and blood while supporting the spleen and stomach, allowing pus to discharge naturally, and toxins to be resolved, promoting the healing of ulcers while restoring appetite and closing wounds. If one neglects to tonify and instead hastily uses cold or cooling treatments, it is said that the genuine qi becomes deficient while the deficiency increases, and that the pathogenic qi becomes strong while the strength increases, often leading to the accumulation of ulcer toxins and excessive foul pus. In severe cases, one may experience a strong pulse, intense thirst, a flushed face, and shortness of breath, indicating that the genuine qi is deficient and could lead to death. The healing of wounds entirely relies on the spleen&#39;s earth, so it is essential to treat with careful observation.<a id="trans-324p" href="#orig-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a><br>The spleen is the officer of storage, while the stomach is the sea of food and water. The stomach is responsible for intake, and the spleen is responsible for digestion. One represents the external, the other the internal; one takes in, the other processes. Their functions operate continuously, giving rise to endless transformations of life. The qi and blood throughout the body, spreading through all meridians, limbs, and bones, as well as the five organs and six bowels, all depend on this for nourishment. When the spleen and stomach are strong, food can be consumed abundantly, leading to easy satiety, increased weight, and robust qi and blood. Conversely, when the spleen and stomach are weak, little food can be taken in or properly digested, resulting in thinness and weakened qi and blood. Thus, life depends on this for sustenance, and health relies on it for stability, especially regarding surgery, which is particularly crucial. Those skilled in health preservation moderate their diet, adjust to the seasons, control joy and anger, and minimize labor; this preserves their spleen and stomach. Otherwise, the spirit, qi, and blood will gradually diminish, the internal organs and meridians will daily weaken, and the flesh and body will gradually deteriorate. One failure in regulation can lead to the onset of numerous ailments; hence, it is understood that the spleen and stomach must be protected. In winter, it is important to keep the bed warm and the room cozy; in summer, cleanliness and brightness are preferable.<a id="trans-325p" href="#orig-325p" class="marker">[325p]</a><br>People&#39;s vital energy tends to enjoy warmth and dislike cold; in the face of cold, it contracts, and with heat, it disperses. When it comes to sores, which are illnesses of broken flesh, if not properly defended against, wind and cold can easily invade. Therefore, when treating sores in winter, one should use firewood or charcoal to generate warmth and expel any lingering cold. In summer, it&#39;s important to keep the room ventilated and free from drafts before removing dressings and washing the sores. It is commonly observed that patients, in summer, may expose themselves to the wind for relief, or sleep in damp places, and in winter, they neglect warm beds and heated rooms. This leads to cold intrusion, which may mildly hinder flesh regeneration, or severely cause a collapse that does not produce pus or heal properly.</p>
<p>As for diet, there is no need for excessive restrictions; avoid cold, hard, and greasy foods! People rely on food for nourishment and should adjust their diets according to the season. If there is swelling and pain, it naturally harms the stomach&#39;s energy, leading to a dislike for various flavors. Only after the sore is drained and the toxins are discharged does the stomach&#39;s energy return, allowing one to desire food again. Foods that are liked can be provided to replenish the spleen and stomach. However, if desired foods are not provided, it goes against the stomach&#39;s energy and can result in an inability to eat. But moderation is key; excessive cold damages the spleen, hard foods are difficult to digest, and fatty, slippery foods upset the intestines, so they should be avoided. Although carbuncles and boils are external ailments, the treatment is similar to that of internal injuries.<a id="trans-326p" href="#orig-326p" class="marker">[326p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> For conditions like carbuncles which appear as large sores on the skin, though they manifest externally, the origin of the illness actually lies within. Can treatment focus solely on the external without addressing the internal? Therefore, if external symptoms do not present, internal remedies should be administered; if there is significant exterior heat, internal cooling and detoxifying must be done. For blood deficiency, one should use Siwu Decoction; for qi deficiency, Si Junzi Decoction; if the pulse is weak and the extremities cold, warming treatment is needed; if the pulse is strong and the body is hot, cooling is required. Thus, there is no distinction between internal and external treatment.</p>
<p>When the pulse is weak and the disease is deficient, one must first apply supplementation; when both external and internal conditions are strong, temporary purging should be employed. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Danxi states: In cases where the sore has not yet ruptured and poison is affecting the viscera, not a trace of heating medicine should be used. Once the sore has broken and the viscera are already damaged, not a trace of cooling medicine should be used. This is indeed a true statement! However, there is another aspect to consider. For example, when the initial disease has not yet ruptured, if the pulse is slightly submerged, slow, weak, fine, rapid, or superficially floating, and the exterior shows coolness with spontaneous sweating, along with ease of vomiting and poor appetite, and the sore does not show signs of eruption, heat, pain, suppuration, or pus, these signs are all due to deficiency in qi and blood.<a id="trans-327p" href="#orig-327p" class="marker">[327p]</a><br>If one insists that the previous discussion has not been resolved, and believes in the theory that toxins attack the organs, one will inevitably resort to cold remedies to counteract this, which will further deplete the vital energy. How can one expect recovery from this? I assert that in treating illness, it is irrelevant whether it is at the beginning or the end; it is difficult to be constrained by a number of days. As long as the pulse and symptoms indicate weakness, one should provide nourishment; only then can one achieve complete recovery. If the nourishing remedy is ineffective and weakness is severe, one must use ginseng and astragalus paste or Eight Immortals cake; for those with yang deficiency, spontaneous sweating, and poor appetite, single ginseng paste or Six Gentlemen Decoction with cardamom and wood aromatic, and if severe, add aconite. For diarrhea with intestinal rumbling and gastric weakness causing nausea and vomiting, ginseng and poria decoction with cardamom, yam, wood aromatic, and persimmon calyx. For spleen deficiency causing sagging, loose stools, and a feeling of heaviness at the anus, Zhongyi Qigong Decoction with yam, shan zha, and five-flavor berry selected as needed. </p>
<p>There are those with exterior excess, having fever without sweating and aversion to cold; interior excess presents as strong pulse with body heat and dry stools, and dry mouth. If exterior symptoms are urgent, initially use Jingfang Baidu Decoction to resolve the exterior; if interior symptoms are urgent, first employ Si Shun Qingliang Yin to assault the interior; if both exterior and interior are involved, it is advisable to use Fang Feng Tong Sheng San to address both aspects. This approach varies according to the order of exterior and interior conditions, treating with active methods. The ancients said that those who receive nourishment do not have mixed phlegm-fire or internal toxins; those who cannot receive nourishment are afflicted by simultaneous attacks of yin fire and damp-heat. They also said that those who respond well to nourishing medicines tend to thrive; whereas those who are weak but do not respond to nourishment cannot be healed. </p>
<p>The key to diagnosing illness is in considering both long-standing and new conditions; the method lies in treating with leniency as well as rigor.<a id="trans-328p" href="#orig-328p" class="marker">[328p]</a><br>In treating illness, there are both new and longstanding conditions, and the severity can vary between urgent and slow. At the onset of illness, when the vital energy is still strong, treatment should directly address the symptoms; if one uses harsh and overpowering remedies, they will not achieve the desired effect in critical moments. However, once the disease has taken hold, if the exterior symptoms are pronounced, one should use a powerful dispersing remedy like the Wanling Pill. For urgent interior conditions, employ a detoxifying mixture like the Huanglian Decoction to quickly restore balance. </p>
<p>In cases of chronic illness, where the excess and deficiency are in conflict, the vital energy is likely weakened. Even if there are residual, mixed, or complex symptoms, one must first stabilize the foundation before making adjustments, harmonizing, or dispersing the illness. This way, the pathogenic energy gradually recedes, the vital energy gradually revives, dietary intake can be gradually increased, and the foundation becomes solid. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that residual issues will no longer pose a problem.<a id="trans-329p" href="#orig-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a><br>The common practitioners do not differentiate between new and chronic illnesses, nor do they understand the connection between deficiency and disease, and how disease leads to deficiency. Furthermore, there are distinctions between deficiency-heat and deficiency-cold. If they recklessly attack or treat conditions, it is akin to a blind person riding a blind horse near a deep pool at midnight—how dangerous this is! </p>
<p>Medications must seek the root and symptoms; the effectiveness is no different than treating the condition first or second. If everything is treated as either an attack or a supplement, the two approaches may lead to errors. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In terms of the operation of heaven and earth, the five movements are the root, and the six qi are the symptoms. In relation to the body, the five organs are the root, and the six bowels are the symptoms. Concerning diseases, the initial illness is the root, and the transmitted illness is the symptom; the vital energy is the root, and the pathogenic energy is the symptom. For any practitioner, it is essential to first treat the root and then address the symptoms, which is indeed the proper method. If one treats the symptoms first and then the root, allowing the pathogenic energy to worsen, the illness will increase. It is also said that in cases of urgency, one treats the symptoms, while in cases of gentleness, one treats the root. For instance, if one first develops a sore and then experiences diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite, it is advisable to focus on the symptoms until the diarrhea stops, the vomiting settles, and eating resumes, before returning to treat the sore. The same principle applies in other cases. If everything is treated uniformly as either an attack or a supplement, it will surely lead to errors, as this pertains to the essence and symptoms of disease. </p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that yang transforms into yin when both internal and external are invaded by coldness.<a id="trans-330p" href="#orig-330p" class="marker">[330p]</a><br>The manifestations of yang include abscesses, heat, fullness, and pain. Generally, these yang symptoms are easier to treat. However, patients often fail to recognize them, thinking they are minor ailments, and do not seek treatment early. Additionally, if they are exposed to wind and cold externally, or suffer internal damage from excessive cold; or if they are improperly treated by a physician with strengthening methods, or if cooling medicines are applied externally to reduce the illness as per the patient&#39;s intent, it frequently leads to the stagnation of qi and blood, damaging the spleen and stomach. Consequently, the toxic pus is unable to surface, resulting in internal attack and potentially fatal outcomes. If changes occur before the eleventh day without the pus having emerged, the condition resembles healthy flesh, is neither painful nor hot, and presents with soft and slow characteristics. The wound only discharges thin, clear fluid, and the body does not feel hot; the pulse is weak and thin, and the appetite is poor, with mental clarity diminished. This indicates that the wound toxin has transformed into true yin. Even if one tries to forcefully administer warming and strengthening medicine, it may yield no response, resulting in almost certain death.<a id="trans-331p" href="#orig-331p" class="marker">[331p]</a><br>If the condition changes after the fifteenth day and pus has appeared, with toxic energy having already manifested outwardly, or if there has been an inappropriate adjustment to the body&#39;s balance, or if one consumes cold substances, and suddenly the condition turns inward (to yin), it is urgent to administer warm tonics and the twelve-flavor extraordinary powder. For lighter cases, the Ten Complete Great Supplement decoction can be used, both with increased amounts of ginseng, astragalus, cinnamon, and aconite for rescue. It is fortunate when the wound is hot and painful, pus emerges, and the pulse improves with food intake. If the wound originates from yang, it tends to heal easily.</p>
<p>How could one expect the yin to turn toward yang, with both ends being supported by warmth? The nature of the illness must consider the true essence, exploring the balance of yin and yang. </p>
<p>(Note: Wounds resulting from yin manifest as carbuncles, coldness, hardness, and deficiency, which inherently belong to difficult-to-treat yin syndromes. The patient, desiring recovery, may resort to spicy warming decoctions and strong hot medicines to assist healing, while the physician might aim for localized swelling and heat to produce pus, applying hot medicines to stimulate the eruption. Thus, the wound receives the extreme heat of the medicine and turns from yin to yang. Although there may be slight swelling, mild heat, slight pain, and a little pus, the wound&#39;s presentation does not resemble a true yang state of vivid red vitality and cannot attain genuine thick yellow pus because it originally stems from yin, hence many succumb. If the treatment is appropriate, with internal and external harmony, balanced forces, there may be one or two remarkable recoveries amidst ten cases. Like rescuing from fire or drowning, actions must not be delayed a moment, akin to walking on ice or facing a precipice, where restraint should be absolute without any recklessness.)<a id="trans-332p" href="#orig-332p" class="marker">[332p]</a><br>If there are differing views on acupuncture, how could there not be detailed classifications for medicinal substances! </p>
<p>(Note: The text discusses the characteristics of different types of swellings, the techniques for puncturing them with needles, and the implications of doing so based on the condition of the pus and the vitality of the patient.)<a id="trans-333p" href="#orig-333p" class="marker">[333p]</a><br>There are also cases of goiters that are soft and painless; blood-related swellings that form lumps inside; stubborn toxins that harden over time, with skin decay, purple flesh, firm roots at the edges, and red threads entwining; indications of tuberculosis that gradually enlarge, decay, and cause pain. These four conditions must not be carelessly pierced; reckless puncturing will surely lead to bleeding, and if it does not stop, it can be quite dangerous. The use of needles should focus on letting the pus flow out with the needle, while the patient feels nothing unusual. </p>
<p>As for tumors, abscesses, hemorrhoids, and other hard and stubborn ailments, if not addressed with the right herbal remedies, cannot see results in a timely manner. Decoctions, powders, and pills, must be precise to hit the mark; the skills of the divine and the skilled are truly a mechanism for learners. There are countless methods and conditions, too many to enumerate fully. Treatment lies in lively methods, and shrewd attention to detail is valued. When properly applied, the physician can be called good. Though the words may seem crude, they serve as a foundation for later students.</p>
<p>It is often said that in times of peace, things were calm, but now there are disturbances. Hence, the dynamics and duties of the world are different; the effort and rest mechanisms have changed. Originally, ailments came from external sources; nowadays, they arise from internal conditions. In ancient times, many issues were concrete, thus treatments were often based on dispersing and promoting; nowadays, many are abstract, requiring nurturing and supplementation. If physicians do not recognize the ancient and connect it to the modern, applying the same indiscriminately, there will certainly be many premature deaths and wrongful treatments.<a id="trans-334p" href="#orig-334p" class="marker">[334p]</a><br><strong>Yang Zheng Ge III</strong></p>
<p>Abscesses, regardless of upper, middle, or lower, are assessed solely through the dichotomy of yin and yang. Although there are distinctions between regular and atypical occurrences, one must consider both high and low aspects. When pure yang first appears, it definitely leads to swelling, additionally accompanied by body heat with slight chill. The top resembles a sharp character, prominent and raised; the swelling looks like the arc of a bow at its root. Within seven days, there is much heat and pain, and by the period of fourteen days, pus gradually spreads. Motion and rest bring tranquility, and food retains its taste; bowel movements are regular with no diarrhea. When the swelling subsides and pus drains, one&#39;s spirit feels refreshed, and rotten flesh gives way to new growth, with qi and blood rejuvenated. Five blessings naturally arrive in unison, while seven evils are completely absent. Pain decreases with the reduction of pus, the swelling retreats leaving the skin spacious. Newly grown flesh appears bright red, while decayed skin retracts, showing pale white. The whole body feels quite comfortable, and all five organs are harmonious and joyful. This condition is categorized as yang deficiency and is easily treatable; a hundred people can be ensured safety and well-being.<a id="trans-335p" href="#orig-335p" class="marker">[335p]</a></p>
<h3>Fourth Song of Pure Yin Syndrome</h3>
<p>Pure yin initially appears without wounds, resembling a hard lump like millet. Not red, not swollen, without pain, slightly warm, slightly hot, lacking defense. After seven days, the body feels weary, and the roots of the wounds are flat, joyfully drenched in soup. The top is not high, and the root is not alive; the color is not bright, and it&#39;s rotten without substance. Soft and sunken, with no pus, just empty gatherings; the pulse is floating, scattered, with great variations. Eating and drinking causes trembling; tasting soup brings a hasty mind. Wounds grow like a garment after shedding armor, and lumps in the openings resemble fragrant seeds. With much pus and foul odor, the body struggles to relieve itself, movements are sad and don&#39;t last long. Wounds form black and purple, and the complexion turns green and yellow. The spirit is hazy, filled with snoring; speech is absent, spontaneously arising. The mouth is dry with a strong tongue; phlegm and wheezing signal impending death. This belongs to pure yin and cannot be treated; each person may reach the fountain.</p>
<h3>Fifth Song of Half Yin Half Yang Syndrome</h3>
<p>In the interplay of yin and yang, life and death coexist, and issues can arise. Slight warmth, slight cold, slight redness and swelling; half dazed, half refreshed, half elevated. Although the pulse comes often, it lacks strength; though food is eaten, it is hard to digest. Swollen but not ulcerated due to spleen weakness; ulcerated but not healing due to excessive pus. Many loose stools and frequent urination; sweating above and a scorched lower body. Five good elements coexist, but seven evils are not fully escaped. Thirsty for tea with abdominal pain; the face puffy, drunken, feeling elevated. Heart troubled and restless, the mind chaotic in fear and noise. Prescribing according to the condition is the secret, yin transforming to yang can gradually be adjusted. The heart truly creates, your life remains firm. Encounter it and it becomes a god’s hand; half dead but still alive, surely do not escape.<a id="trans-336p" href="#orig-336p" class="marker">[336p]</a><br><strong>Song of the Five Virtues, Part Six</strong></p>
<p>A good heart brings a clear spirit; words uttered are pure and smooth. Painful sores do not lead to thirst; waking from sleep brings peace. A good liver makes the body light and untroubled; worries are rendered insignificant. The fingers are red and vibrant; sitting up feels balanced and healthy. A good spleen moistens the lips; the bedding smells of sandalwood and musk. Every meal is flavorful, and the flesh becomes plump and rich. A good lung produces a resonant sound; free of phlegm, the voice lasts longer. The skin feels smooth; bowel movements occur regularly. A good kidney is essential; water rises while fire descends. The mouth is harmonious and not thirsty; urination is abundant and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Song of the Seven Evils, Part Seven</strong></p>
<p>First evil: the spirit is muddled, causing a restless heart and a dry tongue. Sores appear purple and black; speech becomes mumbling. Second evil: the waist is strong; the eyes look askance at others. Sores bleed clear fluid, and anxiety afflicts the liver. Third evil: the body is emaciated; foul-smelling pus arises. Sores are soft and sunken; the spleen fails to feel pain. Fourth evil: the skin is dry; the voice is hoarse and lacks resonance. Phlegm is abundant, causing wheezing; the nose is restless, indicating impending lung failure. Fifth evil: insatiable thirst increases; drinking elicits dryness in the mouth. The complexion becomes grim and dark; the pouch shrinks, harming the kidneys. Sixth evil: the body swells; the intestines gurgle with frequent vomiting. Diarrhea flows unceasingly; the organs are on the verge of collapse. Seventh evil: sores are indented, resembling peeled eels; the limbs feel cold and reversed, and filthy water flows uncontrollably.<a id="trans-337p" href="#orig-337p" class="marker">[337p]</a><br><strong>Song of Treatment for External Wounds - Part Eight</strong></p>
<p>In treating external wounds, follow these guidelines, and make sure to remember them well! Symptoms arise from various roots, with many methods that are not alike. Consider heat and cold, openness and secrecy; understanding the messages leads to knowledge of the causes. Too much openness is insufficient, while excessive secrecy is damaging. Differentiate between true heat and false cold in diagnosis and treatment. Yang can resemble Yin, and Yin can appear like Yang; delve into the subtle principles thoroughly.</p>
<p>Do not treat superficially and internally the same; light conditions may worsen into severe cases and lead to worse outcomes. A physician must be adaptable and cannot rigidly adhere to a single approach. For superficial conditions with severe cold, use Jingfang Baidu San; for internal heat, the internal formula Huanglian Tang is appropriate.</p>
<p>When the wound is established, detoxifying formulas like Tuo Li Xiaoduo San are truly effective; if there’s pus about to burst, the Ten Full Great Supplement Decoction is most suitable. Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang is for post-suppuration nourishing heat; Mu Xiang Liu Qi Yin disperses cold damp causing swelling. If food does not appeal, using Xiang Sha to stimulate appetite is essential; if the spirit is weak, ginseng and atractylodes are needed to revive Yang.</p>
<p>For Yin deficiency and Yang deficiency, Ba Zhen Tang is critical; for night sweats and spontaneous sweating, a single herb of ginseng can strengthen. If pain is prominent after suppuration, the power of Ru Xiang Ding Tong San is remarkable; for a sinking spleen, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang is particularly effective.<a id="trans-338p" href="#orig-338p" class="marker">[338p]</a><br>For a dry mouth with rebellious words, use Huanglian Jiedu Decoction to purge real fire; for irritability and nosebleeds, treat the vacuous yang with Xijiao Dihuang Decoction. The ancient method for treating carbuncles and sores is called the Immortal’s Vitality Decoction; modern doctors invent new prescriptions, hoping for divine wisdom with the Health Decoction.</p>
<p>Chan Su pills are renowned in surgery as a unique remedy, while Huxin Powder clears internal toxins and is known as peerless. Who knew that Wax Alumen Pill, protective and nurturing, could be admired for its subtle flavor? Also commendable is Yuhong Ointment for generating flesh, capable of exuding auspicious signs from decay.</p>
<p>For coolness from spontaneous sweating, abdominal pain, bowel sounds, and nausea, how can one avoid Yigong Powder? For restless sleep, when vacuous yang stirs with much pus, one must use Shengyu Decoction. Shengmai Powder supports the vacuous and weak, with a faint pulse; Guipi Decoction removes fright and palpitations, ensuring peaceful slumber.</p>
<p>Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction suit vacuity and anxiety; those with fevered bodies have no need for doubt. Maidong Qingfei Decoction eliminates heat from the diaphragm; those with phlegm should not hesitate. Jinli Decoction treats lung abscesses with purulent cough and urgent air; Yuanguidan attacks toxic and foul rotten sores.</p>
<p>Fengre Shengchuan Tongsheng Powder treats sores caused by wind-heat; for frantic ulcers, Baoguan Dan breaks through. Xiao Chai Hu Decoction expels external evils and wavering heat, while Daffeng Powder attacks cold and dampness in the legs and knees. For a swollen and sore throat, one should certainly use Qingyan Lige Powder; with red and purple spots, how can one escape Huaban Jiedu Decoction?</p>
<p>Eighty-One Pill alleviates dry mouth cleverly; Ershen Pill treats unusual spleen leakage with a marvelous formula.<a id="trans-339p" href="#orig-339p" class="marker">[339p]</a><br>The Xianglian Pill is universally effective for treating organ dysentery. The Ganlu Drink treats rotten teeth and gums effectively. The Liuhe Decoction harmonizes the spleen and stops vomiting and diarrhea, while the Shuangjie Powder resolves external conditions and addresses internal injuries. The Xiaoyao Powder is excellent for treating women&#39;s ailments, and the Baoyuan Decoction often supports children who are frequently injured. For dry and brittle skin and hair, the Lucang Pill shows quick effectiveness; for sore throat and swollen gums, the Bingbeng Powder has exceptional efficacy. The Zishen Pill treats deficiency of the lower kidney region, while the Liangge Powder alleviates excess heat in the upper body, relieving restlessness. The Jiulong Pill eliminates fishy breath, ingested to erase traces; the Erjiao Powder disperses dampness and swelling, ensuring health upon consumption. The Lüzu Yizhi Plum stops dysentery and calms fright, being called a celestial medicine; the Zhenjun Miaotie Drink alleviates pain and stoppage, known as a miraculous formula. For hemorrhoids, fistulas, tumors, and toxins, the ancient Sanpin Pill is praised; for boils and various wind-induced ailments, the modern Wanling Pill is admired. The Chaihu Qinggan Decoction treats scalp sores effectively, and the Huanglian Disinfection Drink is especially good for treating oral and governing vessel ailments. For ulcers in children’s mouths, one must use the Renzhongbaisan; for swollen and painful throats in adults, the Jinsuozi Decoction is essential. For newly or chronically occurring ulcers, the Pearl Powder is effective, while the Mutu Decoction is strong for falls and bruises.<a id="trans-340p" href="#orig-340p" class="marker">[340p]</a><br>Shoulders raised, treat stiffness and pain in the arms; Nian Pain Decoction eliminates pain from leg rheumatism. When small ulcers appear in urination, Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction is admirable; for swelling and pain in the head, Pu Ji Xiao Du Decoction is beneficial! For toxins causing hanging sores, internal dispersal, no need for concern? For boils on the buttocks and leg conditions, Qi Chai Decoction brings safety without harm. </p>
<p>There are also women&#39;s genital sores, which can swell, hurt, or itch; in life, one can either disperse, nourish, or address parasitic disturbances. Moreover, the male&#39;s scrotal sores indicate damp heat in the liver channels. For children with red rashes, detoxification complements blood-letting. </p>
<p>In treating Yangmei sores, avoiding fumigation is crucial. Under the tongue, when phlegm manifests as a bag, one must cut to relieve; if it flows like egg white, phlegm dissolution is the true remedy. For toxic knots and stubborn sores, Zijing Ointment can be applied. Wind sores itch deeply, Xionghuang Powder is highly effective. For carbuncles, first pricking the sores to draw blood is essential; internal toxins should be resolved through sweating. </p>
<p>Moxibustion is prohibited, but acupuncture is not, fearing cotton yet not iron. There are also cases of atrophic swelling, hard as rock and protruding. Stagnation in the yin may present specific symptoms and appearances to differentiate. One example is the hard lump in a woman&#39;s breast. Before breaking, the flesh is ruptured, already leaking foul blood. </p>
<p>Such conditions, few treatises have addressed throughout history. There are hundreds of types of sores, difficult to articulate all. It lies in a single point of understanding, no need for a lengthy explanation. If scholars are perceptive, all matters will be thoroughly comprehended. This is a rough song, to be both criticized and appreciated.<a id="trans-341p" href="#orig-341p" class="marker">[341p]</a><br><strong>Moxibustion Method and Prohibition of Moxibusting Wounds - Chapter Nine</strong></p>
<p>When a wound first appears, moxibustion should be performed only above the neck, using mugwort fire on all other parts. The amount of moxa used should correspond to the size of the wound. Garlic should be sliced thin and placed on top of the wound, then moxa cones are placed on top, and the garlic is ignited, replacing the garlic slices after three burns. If the initial moxibustion causes pain, stop when it turns from pain to itching; if there is no pain at first, you should stop when you feel a slight discomfort. If there is no sensation of pain or itching at all during the initial moxibustion, the garlic should be removed, and stronger moxibustion should be applied. In cases where the wound has been present for several days, if the moxa cones do not sufficiently address the issue, garlic should be crushed and spread on the wound, with moxa also layered on top of the garlic, then ignited for moxibustion, ensuring that the pain is felt significantly for effectiveness. This allows the fire energy to penetrate deeper, indicating that the pain is in a good flesh layer. Essentially, moxa fire draws out hidden toxins, facilitates the opening of the wound, and enables internal toxins to be expelled externally, making this a fundamental first method in wound treatment. Early moxibustion is particularly important for best results.<a id="trans-342p" href="#orig-342p" class="marker">[342p]</a><br>There are also several prohibitions on moxibustion, which should be carefully considered. The head is the summit of all yang, a place of pure yang without yin. Any sores or swellings are caused by excessive yang heat. If moxibustion is applied, it will further intensify the toxic heat, leading to even greater swelling, which is most capable of provoking internal phlegm, resulting in certain death. The same applies to sores on the face.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a point called &quot;Shen Yu,&quot; located beside the spine at the lower back, where the essence of the kidneys is connected. Sores from this point often arise due to sexual exertion causing depletion and depletion of kidney water. If moxibustion is again applied, it will scorch the source, leading to internal and external dryness, often resulting in blackened, sunken depression and death.</p>
<p>Moreover, in patients with intrinsically weak vital energy, sores may not be inflamed or raised. Such individuals will feel lethargic, their spirits will be short and dim, the pulse will be floating, scattered, and empty, quick but without strength. The internal true qi cannot counteract the fiery qi. If moxibustion is applied to such a person, they will likely fall into delirium and die. It is often said that moxibustion does not harm people; this statement is misguided!<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a><br><strong>On the Laws of Illness and Life and Death - Chapter Ten</strong></p>
<p>Upon birth, one is like a grain of millet, able to contain grains within; outwardly, one resembles hemp, while inwardly, one is like a melon; externally, one appears like currency, yet can contain a fist internally. Though the start may be vigorous, it ultimately bears no harm. One may grow gray prematurely, but without pus, one can rest assured. Ulcers arise from bumps, and only upon the emergence of pus may allowance be made. Swelling that bursts with vigor will restore health without treatment. The root is high and the apex even higher; longevity until eighty may still be achievable. Swelling that overheats can easily rot, yet in the end, remains unharmed. Ulcers that are high in heat and pain, although distressing, are destined to heal. When ulcers feel soft and lack vitality, supplementation is beneficial. Flesh that swells without ulceration will undoubtedly raise suspicions. If pus-ridden, one cannot retain their appetite, leading to the calamity of yellow diarrhea. Ulcers appearing purple like pig liver will assuredly lead to death if no pus is present. Soft rotting lacks decay, yet there is fear of grapes being embedded within. Lying on one’s back and feeling no pain indicates a dire condition for survival. When corruption is complete, foul energy arises; smiling while shedding tears is one’s fate. With roots dispersed and ulcers flattened, even deities have no method of treatment. After prolonged illness, if the eyes reveal signs of spirit, one’s life is in peril. The face suddenly appears painted with oil; after ten days, separation is inevitable. Among decay, if there is fresh flesh, even a heavy burden may allow for recovery. New flesh like a board will surely deteriorate without nourishment. Hands and feet that are dry and withered, with blood having failed, bring forth difficulty in preservation. Pale lips and lifeless eyes, with abdominal swelling set to collapse. Stale energy fails to revive, no matter how grave the condition may seem. Darkened eye sockets indicate that abscesses fear this encounter. Aromatic fragrances in the room signify that illness may end in blessing. When ulcers are hot and the body slightly warm, what need is there for concern over a mild illness? Life and death are sought within this; a single word may determine fate.<a id="trans-344p" href="#orig-344p" class="marker">[344p]</a><br><strong>Observing Shape and Color: Chapter Eleven</strong></p>
<p>In examining a person&#39;s illness, one must observe their shape and color, then relate this to the pulse and the sickness; truly understanding at the onset will decisively determine the outcome, with no mistakes. How do we know this? </p>
<p>For yin diseases, one observes yang colors: the cheeks and jaw will appear red; for yang diseases, one sees yin colors: the nails will appear blue. Both of these conditions signify imminent death. </p>
<p>When the body is hot, the pulse is thin, lips and mouth turn purple, and the eyes look dead: this is fatal. If the face appears smeared with grease, the color is muddy yellow, and there’s an oily, dark aura: this is fatal.</p>
<p>If lips and tongue are dry and scorched, the nose emits a sooty smell, and the eyes reveal a vacant look: this is fatal. When the complexion is emaciated, the spirit is confused and short-lived, and the body shrinks: this is fatal.</p>
<p>When one experiences coarse, short breaths, the nose flares with clear secretions, and speech becomes nonsensical: this is fatal. When one gropes for clothing and feels the bed, has urinary incontinence, and seems empty: this is fatal.</p>
<p>If the head droops with weakness, the eyes lack focus, and breathing is short and labored: this is fatal. When the skin breaks without blood, the flesh has rotten patches, and one feels numb and cannot sense pain or itchiness: this is fatal.</p>
<p>If the teeth are yellow like boiled beans, the lips are pale and lack lines, the ears are black, dry, and deaf, the philtrum is flattened, the mouth is open with breath escaping and not returning, the nose flares with each breath, sweating like beads without dispersing, phlegm is sticky and hardened, nasal blood is red like lung color, nails are curved and blueish, the mind is dim and scattered, the spirit is detached and agitated, the person is dressed in black with a distorted face, and a dark aura overwhelms the heavens: encountering these signs, one is certainly facing death. The principles lie within this evaluation.<a id="trans-345p" href="#orig-345p" class="marker">[345p]</a><br><strong>On the Causes of Disease and Their Treatment</strong></p>
<p>There are three causes of disease: internal, external, and neither internal nor external. This classification originates from ancient times, and its meaning remains somewhat incomplete. The internal cause arises from the accumulation of the seven emotions within, exacerbated by rich foods and fatty substances that damage the organs. Sexual activity may also fatigue the body, depleting vitality, leading to illness in the five organs. Typically, this manifests more in the wealthy and the obese, with symptoms including numerous hard sores that are deeply rooted. There are irregularities in urination and defecation, reduced appetite, and a soft exterior with a hard interior; the abscesses do not produce pus, indicating a solid exterior but a deficient interior, making it difficult for toxins to discharge. Those who suffer from this represent internal injuries, hence the term internal cause.</p>
<p>The external cause arises from the six excessive influences. Individuals with weak constitutions can be affected by summer and autumn dew when they lie exposed, or by sitting or sleeping in damp areas, leading to the invasion of wind, cold, and dampness into the meridians. Additionally, engaging in sexual activities may lead to the infiltration of cold and toxins into the bones and marrow, further complicating their condition; this might be compounded by external wind pathogens that have not completely dissipated, resulting in swelling and pain. This affects the muscles, blood vessels, tendons, and bones.<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a><br>The illness arises from external factors, primarily resulting from poor regulation and care, affecting the laboring class in about 80-90% of the cases. Common symptoms include the alternation of cold and heat, pain in the muscles and bones, difficulty in walking, accumulation of damp phlegm, and various forms of paralysis such as crooked mouth and eyes, hemiplegia, as well as rheumatism and seasonal toxins. Those who suffer from these symptoms are said to be affected by external causes, hence the term “external cause.” </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are cases without both internal and external causes, where there are no emotional disturbances internally or external injuries from the six excesses. How then can such illnesses arise? They often stem from imbalance in eating and labor, irregular emotions, improperly tempered food and drink, and excessive labor resulting in disharmony among the organs, disarray of the protective and nourishing systems, damage to the spleen and stomach, and stagnation in the meridians. Therefore, these illnesses do not present with the six meridian patterns externally, nor with obstruction in urination or defecation internally, and they often manifest in the outer membranes or between the flesh and skin, resembling conditions like scrofula, phlegm accumulation, qi obstruction, or tumors.</p>
<p>In treating these conditions, it is unnecessary to resort to invasive treatments; rather, one should focus on nourishing qi and blood, regulating the meridians, strengthening the spleen and harmonizing the middle, as well as resolving phlegm and alleviating stagnation. This approach is deemed the most effective. Thus ends the discussion of these three causes.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a><br><strong>Guidelines for Regulation - Chapter Thirteen</strong></p>
<p>When a person is without illness, they do not know how to manage their health, leading to the emergence of countless diseases. How could one expect to recover from illness if they do not regulate themselves after falling ill? There are principles for treatment: First, examine the patient&#39;s vitality to determine whether it is deficient or sufficient. Next, assess the nature of the sores, considering their yin and yang aspects and any dangers they might present. Then apply treatments accordingly; attack when necessary, supplement when needed. One must not procrastinate or delay, as this can lead to unforeseen complications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the patient must stabilize their mind and let go of distractions, ensuring they do not act hastily, which helps protect their spirit and energy from disruption. Furthermore, one should align with the seasons: in the summer heat, avoid exposure to drafts and do not place water in front of the bed; during winter cold, it is essential to keep warm and moderate in daily activities. It is crucial to prevent cold from entering the body, as it can cause various complications. </p>
<p>Before sores have ruptured, if there are signs of internal toxins, and if the patient experiences dry mouth and thirst, they should be given cool items in small amounts to help nourish and balance the internal heat. Once the pus has erupted, all cold and hard substances should be avoided; otherwise, it will damage the spleen and stomach, complicating the formation of pus, leading to soft, sunken sores that are hard to heal.<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a><br>Food and drink must be fragrant, dry, sweet, and pleasant; porridge and rice should align with one’s preferences, and one should not eat to excess. It is better to consume small portions that are warm and rich, to avoid stagnation, and they should also be easy to digest. After a large sore has burst, when both qi and blood are deficient and the spleen and stomach are weak, one must prepare Eight Immortals Cake and eat a few pieces morning and evening to replenish vital essence and support the fundamentals. Furthermore, one should prepare ginseng and atractylodes paste. </p>
<p>If a patient has both a weak spleen and stomach, decreased appetite, tightness in the chest, and finds food tasteless, then take three spoonfuls of atractylodes paste and two spoonfuls of ginseng paste, and consume it with clear rice broth on an empty stomach; if one enjoys drinking, it can also be mixed with wine. If the patient feels lethargic, drowsy, has spontaneous sweating, is fatigued, and is sluggish, then three spoonfuls of ginseng paste and two spoonfuls of atractylodes paste should also be mixed with wine. </p>
<p>For cases with rough skin, a pale complexion, blood in stool, scant and constipated bowel movements, or dry skin and hair, mix two spoonfuls of prepared rehmannia paste and take it, or drink Yangchun wine, which is even better. These remedies strengthen spirits, quickly generate qi and blood, stimulate appetite, support the spleen, and nourish the skin and bones. These two medicines are extraordinarily effective and are essential after a large sore; they are incomparable to herbal remedies. The patient should trust in these treatments to avoid further changes. A cursory glance may suggest many ailments are recurrent and unstable. Thus, there is a distinction between easy and difficult recovery, which truly depends on gaining or losing these remedies.<a id="trans-349p" href="#orig-349p" class="marker">[349p]</a><br><strong>Miscellaneous Prohibitions to Know, Chapter 14</strong></p>
<p>All illnesses, though they may require medication and regulation, must also adhere to certain prohibitions. First, the sickroom must be kept clean; in winter, it should be warm with proper bedding, and in summer, it should be cool, to prevent the intrusion of flies and centipedes. Monks, nuns, those in mourning, women engaged in religious duties, and distant guests should not see patients with open wounds. Odorous and strong-smelling substances like beef, dog meat, and preserved or cured items can cause thirst and dryness; cold fruits like melons, pears, persimmons, water chestnuts, and dates can harm the stomach and injure the spleen. Meats from chickens, geese, sheep, as well as shellfish, pufferfish, shrimp, and crabs can provoke itching and wind disorders. Greasy, fried, grilled, salty, and sour foods greatly aid the creation of phlegm. Red beans and buckwheat can provoke illnesses due to agitation; anger and anxiety can lead to fullness and obstruction; overeating can surely harm the spleen. After a wound has healed, engaging in labor too soon can lead to weakness, while entering a room prematurely can diminish longevity. Not avoiding wind and cold can cause the resurgence of toxins. Not adjusting one&#39;s diet can lead to excessive itching from wounds. Large wounds should be avoided for six months, while minor wounds should be avoided for a hundred days. This is indeed the wisdom of a knowledgeable gentleman.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a><br><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<p>Initially, if a peak arises with a high root, is red, heated, swollen, and painful, gradually increasing in swelling is favorable. If it has become inflamed and painful, with thin, shiny skin, and eating and drinking remain normal, with balanced bodily functions and warmth, it is favorable. If there is already a discharge of thick pus that is bright and does not smell foul, with necrotic flesh falling away, if the swelling can easily dissipate and the body feels light, it is favorable. After rupture, if the pus is thick, yellow, and new flesh grows easily, with the sore closing up gradually as eating advances, it is favorable. </p>
<p>If, at the outset, there is a flat peak with a dispersed root, dark in color, slightly swollen, neither heated nor painful, with fatigue in the body, it is unfavorable. If it becomes a hard swelling that is purple, does not produce pus, does not decay or rupture, but the person feels dry and excessively restless, it is unfavorable. If there is rupture with rotten skin, hard flesh that does not decay, swelling that still does not reduce, and pain that persists, with restlessness in the heart, it is unfavorable. After rupture, if the pus is clear and thin, despite the necrotic flesh falling away, if new flesh does not grow, and the color is foul and stinking, it is fatal.<a id="trans-351p" href="#orig-351p" class="marker">[351p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Abscesses</h3>
<p>When an abscess first appears, whether it is painful or not, and regardless of the yin and yang or exterior and interior, if it has not yet produced pus, it is advisable to cauterize it. After cauterization, if there is uncertainty about pain or itching, apply cauterization again. If there is swelling accompanied by heat, occasional pain, and a floating, rapid pulse without constipation, it is suitable to apply medication. If the body feels rigid, the pulse is tense, and there is aversion to cold while preferring warmth, the pathogen is on the exterior, and it is appropriate to induce sweating. If the swelling is hard and pain is deep, with dryness of the mouth and constipation, and the body is hot with a solid pulse, the pathogen is in the interior, and purging is recommended. If the pain intensifies, with restlessness and a desire for cold drinks, alongside a dry tongue and parched mouth, the heat is ascending, and it is advisable to clear it. If the swelling is painful and hard, with a back feeling like it is bearing a stone, accompanied by nausea and dry vomiting, the toxic pathogen is internal; thus, detoxification is necessary, and if the swelling and pain worsen daily without internal pus draining and the wound is filled with stagnant flesh, it is urgent to open and cut it. If the swelling is soft and has not produced pus or does not ulcerate, it indicates a deficiency of yang energy, and strengthening the spleen and stomach to support yang energy is essential. If the body feels cool, there is spontaneous sweating, hands and feet are cold, the six pulses are weak and thin, with diarrhea, it indicates yang collapse, and urgent warming is needed.<a id="trans-352p" href="#orig-352p" class="marker">[352p]</a><br><strong>Ulcer Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>When the pus is matured but not yet ruptured, and the sore is not hot and the appetite is low with loose stools, this indicates spleen deficiency; thus, warm the interior and nourish. If the pus is clear or abundant, and the sore is widely opened without new tissue forming, this suggests internal deficiency and possible transformation of the condition; thus, administer strong tonics. Even if necrotic tissue has sloughed off, if new tissue is slow to grow and appears frost-colored, this indicates cold and weak flesh; therefore, provide strong warming to Qi and blood. After rupture, if there is little appetite, restlessness, insomnia, fever with thirst, this indicates weak spleen and yin deficiency; thus, tonify the middle and benefit Qi. If there is a cool body, weak pulse, lethargy with little speech, and lack of taste in food, this indicates weak spleen; therefore, awaken the spleen and assist the stomach. If wind-cold affects the sore, causing pale skin that does not contract, provide warmth from within and nourishment from without. If after rupture the face is yellow and the body is thin with clear and sparse pus, and the sore appears pale white, this indicates the need for fragrant drying to support the spleen. If the pulse is large and weak, fine, soft, and slightly submerged, along with spontaneous sweating and coolness of the body, this indicates deficiency of both Qi and blood; thus, administer strong tonics. If there is bleeding or copious pus, along with palpitations in the palms and something like fever, with agitation and insomnia, this indicates loss of yang; thus, respond urgently with tonics. If the sore has closed, but there has been sexual activity or strenuous labor, or if there is sudden severe rupture again, supportive tonics for Qi and blood are still necessary.<a id="trans-353p" href="#orig-353p" class="marker">[353p]</a><br><strong>Names of Sores According to the Ten Rules</strong></p>
<p>Sores on the back are called &quot;yang&quot; or &quot;yin&quot;, and the same goes for the shoulder and arm. Lung yang is on the right, while yin is on the left; bee sores are found on both sides near the throat. The right ear corresponds to sharp poison, and left ear yang meets at the same point. The two shoulders together are named &quot;tied hands,&quot; with &quot;well sores&quot; originating from the heart. </p>
<p>Flowing channels and tendons connect six or seven constitutions, appearing below the heart, directly at the navel. Rib sores develop below the ribs, and yin sores typically appear near the gate. Ankle sores penetrate beneath the solitary joint, while foot ailments originally arise from the soles. The left corresponds to easy poison and the right to fish mouth, with crane knee wind forming at the knee&#39;s eye. </p>
<p>Below the shoulder, the armpit has yin sores, and the throat&#39;s upper and lower parts require treatment for qi sores. Note the pulse at the &quot;Dui&quot; point, which is three inches apart and penetrates the bone base. Red thread sores arise from the hands, while moth-like throat wind occurs within the mouth. </p>
<p>Kidney sores manifest on the left and right at the kidneys, with the &quot;Sanli&quot; point indicating attached yin sores. Four inches from the navel is the &quot;Xia&quot; sore, three inches higher is the &quot;You&quot; sore. Intestinal sores also emerge from the navel, whereas chest sores are centered in the heart and lungs, just above the breast. </p>
<p>The &quot;Hegu&quot; sore is named &quot;Tiger&#39;s Mouth,&quot; and the &quot;Snake Head&quot; meets the &quot;Fish Belly&quot; on the fingertips. A sore at the back of the head is called &quot;Jade Pillow,&quot; which should not be confused with others. </p>
<p>Shoulder sores and &quot;Le&quot; sores are on the right hand, and the pomegranate is three inches from the elbow. Left kidney yin and right crotch sores appear, while biting bone occurs above the &quot;Yinbao&quot; point. Deep kidney sores are found on the legs, attached to the bones, while &quot;Fo Ding&quot; sores arise from the top of the brain. </p>
<p>Remember these worldly toxic sores; treating patients appropriately leads to peace in life.<a id="trans-354p" href="#orig-354p" class="marker">[354p]</a><br>The zygomatic bone is where the furuncle occurs, above the lips is a sore treated by doctors. Between the eyebrows, the phoenix brow encroaches upon the brain; a black furuncle in the ears is not surprising. A furuncle inside the nose must be treated swiftly; the origin of the condition actually starts at the hairline. The sore at the end of the eyebrow is very toxic; the cheek furuncle near the mackerel eye is in line with the jaw.</p>
<p>A horse blade can cause tuberculous lymphadenopathy and goiter, a condition originating from the neck. The poison of the tiger and the dragon&#39;s spring lurks within the upper and lower lips, originally concealed within the mouth. The abscess at the root of the teeth is no different; the furuncle below the teeth occurs in a line. The protrusion in the gap of the upper teeth needs treatment; do not let it develop into a common sore in the world.</p>
<p>Abscesses from the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys should be examined by a physician of acupuncture in the chest. Furthermore, there are yellow heads and white blisters appearing rapidly without a fixed place. On the left is the horse&#39;s sitting position, on the right, its dismount; the tip of the coccyx and the stork&#39;s beak raise suspicions. This ailment can kill; urgent treatment is necessary without delay.</p>
<p>Women may experience various types in the breast; a high lump indicates an abscess and hardened sore. There are also true evil symptoms resembling a lump the size of a stubborn stone, breaking apart like a ruin. The wind of the button appears on the neck; the wind sore beneath the skirt must be treated at the feet. There are also humid eczema and similar diseases, commonly occurring on the lower legs.</p>
<p>Infants may suffer from rotten teeth and black decay; the opening of sores becomes unbearable. Scarlet fever and other diseases can spread throughout the body; thrush can cover the mouth entirely. Wind sores and milk crusts bring much itching; blood and pus create painful and unsettled nests. Additionally, there are signs of fetal heat in the heart and spleen, and mouth sores often resemble a heavy tongue.<a id="trans-355p" href="#orig-355p" class="marker">[355p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>Carbuncles are a swift external disease. They can appear in the morning and result in death by evening; some may not die for three to five days, yet eventually succumb after a month or a half-month. This variation depends on the depth of the poison, the imbalance of the organs, and the temperature of the season, as well as sudden changes in the environment. In livestock, when a body decays, their temperament can drastically change, causing a violent reaction that leads to immediate onset. For humans, those with deficient qi and blood can be affected according to their organs. For example, if toxic energy arises from the heart meridian, it manifests as fiery carbuncles. This condition often appears in the lips, mouth, palms, and finger joints, starting as small red-yellow blisters that cause intense itching and pain, along with numbness in the limbs. In severe cases, one may experience alternating chills and fever, dizziness, irritability, mental confusion, and disorientation; these symptoms arise from heart-related afflictions. If toxic energy arises from the liver meridian, it presents as purple sparrow carbuncles.<a id="trans-356p" href="#orig-356p" class="marker">[356p]</a><br>The affliction often manifests as sores between the limbs, waist, and sides of the body. It begins with purple blisters that burst the next day, leading to bleeding and watery discharge. After three days, it causes the muscles to rot and the bones to decay, resulting in severe pain and suffering. In serious cases, the eyes become red and squinting, the nails turn dark blue, the tongue stiffens, and the spirit becomes dull, often accompanied by restless sleep and startling dreams. These symptoms arise from diseases of the Liver channel.</p>
<p>When toxic qi arises in the Spleen channel, it manifests as yellow festering sores. Initially, yellow blisters appear, shiny and moist, surrounded by red edges. The affliction first emerges at the corners of the mouth, the lower and upper eyelids, and the frontal area of the temples, causing itching and tightness. In severe cases, it leads to nausea and vomiting, pain in the limbs, alternating chills and fever, and excessive thirst. These symptoms are signs of diseases of the Spleen channel.</p>
<p>When toxic qi arises in the Lung channel, it results in white festering sores. At first, white blisters emerge, hard on top and protruding at the roots. They burst, releasing greasy fluid, leading to sudden itching and pain, easily becoming rotten and sunken. In severe cases, it can damage the jaw and throat, cause elevated body temperature and cough with purulent phlegm, and lead to difficulty breathing. These conditions stem from diseases of the Lung channel.</p>
<p>When toxic qi arises in the Kidney channel, it presents as black festering sores.<a id="trans-357p" href="#orig-357p" class="marker">[357p]</a><br>The affliction often emerges in the ear canal, chest, abdomen, waist, and obscure soft tissues between the kidneys. At first, it manifests as black spots with purple blisters, toxins invading the skin, gradually attacking the muscles, becoming as hard as nails, causing pain that penetrates to the marrow. In severe cases, the extremities turn blue and purple, accompanied by fright, depression, and a sinking sensation. The eyes may reveal distress; these symptoms arise from kidney channel disorders. The five types of sores correspond to the five visceral organs. </p>
<p>Additionally, the red thread sore appears between the joints of the palm, initially resembling a small wound, then developing red threads that escalate to the knuckles, causing chills and fevers, and in severe cases, nausea and vomiting. If left untreated, the red threads can reach the heart and may lead to serious harm. To treat the red thread sore, one should use a needle at the tip of the red thread to create an incision and let it bleed, then make an incision at the initial wound, inserting toad venom strips and applying medicated plaster, with internal consumption of diaphoretic medicines for self-healing. </p>
<p>In treating this condition, early intervention is crucial. Those treated promptly have a full chance of recovery, while those treated slightly later may have a chance of only fifty to sixty percent. Those who neglect treatment only have a slim one or two in ten chance of recovery.<a id="trans-358p" href="#orig-358p" class="marker">[358p]</a><br>When the condition begins above the neck, if the three yang channels are affected by poison, one must use a beryllium needle to pierce the center of the sore four or five fen deep, severing the root of the carbuncle to allow the bad blood to flow out. Then, one should apply Huai-Deng Dan or toad venom strips into the opening and cover it with an ointment. If the condition is below the neck and the three yin channels are affected, one should resort to moxibustion. If the moxibustion is painless, it is also necessary to use needles to insert medicinal substances for effectiveness. Subsequently, one should use toad venom pills. In winter, with Wanling Dan, inducing a vigorous sweat is necessary to dissipate the poison, lest it linger and cause transformations. Nowadays, people’s treatment methods do not differentiate between yin and yang or the surface and internal; whenever they see a sore, they apply moxibustion indiscriminately. They do not realize that the head is the apex of all yang, and excessive yang heat leads to serious issues. Although small, its harm is significant; further moxibustion only enhances the fire, forcing the poison inward to attack, which may result in severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin. After this occurs, the head, face, ears, and neck can all swell, resembling a bloated corpse, arising with seven evils. Even if there are methods available for treatment, only one or two out of a hundred may be effective. Moreover, there are various types of carbuncles with differing shapes, hence the old sayings about them are not recorded in detail here.<a id="trans-359p" href="#orig-359p" class="marker">[359p]</a><br>At first, it appears like mange, resembling a pimple, either as small blisters or bumps, and if it is swollen and does not dissipate, it is considered favorable. If the sore does not exhibit cold or heat, does not cause nausea, and the appetite is normal with warm hands and feet, it is also favorable. Once the condition has formed, if the sore is swollen but the flesh is not, surrounded by white, causing more pain and less itching, and produces pus, it is favorable. If pus has already oozed out but the sore remains high and swollen, with bright flesh and a gradually flattening center that is red and lively, it is favorable. If it begins resembling a carbuncle but is soft and greyish, with flat, swollen edges, it is unfavorable. If before erupting, there are symptoms of cold and heat like malaria, with nausea and loss of appetite, and later, the sore appears like mosquito bites or flea spots, or in bluish-purple and black blisters, soft and depressed with deep rotten holes, and there is coarse breath with cold extremities, it is unfavorable. If the sore resembles a fish&#39;s navel, soft and puffy with a sunken, greyish-white top, with a thin pulse and cool body, it is mostly unfavorable; if already formed, with swollen flesh but the sore not rising, roots scattered, and the tip decayed and foul with blood and fluids, it indicates death. In general, for sores above the neck, needle punctures do not cause pain; below the neck, moxibustion does not cause pain, both indicate death. If it has already spread, causing swelling in the head, neck, ears, and face, accompanied by irritability, a thin pulse, and wheezing, it indicates death. If over time, the original sore shows no traces and the areas it spread to produce pus again, with a rapid pulse and dry lips, it will ultimately lead to death. However, if the illness is severe but the circumstances are favorable, life can be preserved; if the sore is minor but the circumstances are unfavorable, danger is constant.<a id="trans-360p" href="#orig-360p" class="marker">[360p]</a><br>When a condition arises above the neck, one must first use acupuncture to remove the bad blood, ensuring that the poison does not attack internally. When the condition arises below the neck, one must first use moxibustion to eliminate its force, so that it does not invade the healthy flesh. For fever and chills, with a tense and rapid pulse, indicating an external pathogen, it is appropriate to induce sweating to disperse it. If there is body heat, dry throat, strong pulse, and constipation, it is advisable to allow for a purgation. After acupuncture, if sores do not become rotten, and the swelling does not subside, additional internal medication should be applied. If initial moxibustion leads to unceasing yellow toxins, one must urgently use needling at the exit points to remove the bad blood. If there are chills and fever with dry retching, irritability and thirst, as well as confusion and faintness, it is necessary to detoxify and clear the heart, and protect the membranes. After a rupture, if qi and blood are injured, with lethargy and poor appetite, and restless sleep, it is advised to support the spleen and stomach to stabilize the spirit. As one nears recovery and qi and blood gradually return, food should be consumed. If there is still thirst, it is urgent to nourish the kidney water.<a id="trans-361p" href="#orig-361p" class="marker">[361p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Phlegmon</strong></p>
<p>Phlegmon arises when wounds fester for too long without healing, resulting in the stagnation of qi and blood, leading to a lack of nourishment for the bones. Fine bones accumulate toxins and transform into larger bones. This occurs from the mingling of essences and blood during conception, which will eventually lead to this condition. Since the kidneys govern the bones, it is advisable to take Kidney Qi Pills and Shiquan Dabu Decoction to first replenish the spleen and kidneys; then apply moxa sticks wrapped in mugwort and attach them to warm the area, causing the necrotic and decayed bones to naturally shed, allowing new flesh to grow and the wound to heal. </p>

It is said that many cases of carbuncles arise from anger. If experiencing such a condition, there will likely be a lot of anger, but just taking Xiangfuzi and eating to relieve qi will be effective.</p>
<p><strong>Yuan Zhi Jiu</strong>: This remedy treats all types of boils, carbuncles, abscesses, and severe toxic conditions. If there is dead blood or hidden toxins inside, it may not hurt; applying the remedy will cause pain. If there is emotional distress like anger causing internal obstruction, the pain will be unbearable; applying it will alleviate the pain. If there is internal heat causing sensitivity, the application will bring coolness. If qi is deficient and blood weak, leading to non-healing wounds, or if there is internal emotional repression, treating it will surely bring recovery. Prepare Yuan Zhi by soaking it in an adequate amount of water, then pounding it into a powder. Mix three qian of the powder into a cup of wine, strain, and drink the clear liquid while applying the residue to the affected area.</p>

After a long while, remove it. This will draw out the toxic gas, reduce pain, and close the wound. Let the pus drain out without squeezing. The next day, repeat the process, and on the third day as well. If the wound is particularly severe, it can be applied seven, eight, or nine times; if small, once may suffice.

<p>Five parts of pearl, twelve-month-old cow dung for use; remaining months burned to preserve its properties; iron rust each weighing one tael. Grind into a very fine powder, mix with pig brain marrow and good vinegar, and apply to the wound three to five times for healing. For early-stage issues, it resolves on its own. Avoid consuming any toxic substances.</p>
<p>Mai Fan Shi Gao: Apply around the wound after pus has discharged.</p>
<p>For Mai Fan Shi, no fixed amount is required; calcine over charcoal until red, then quench in good vinegar. Repeat this calcination several times, grinding it into powder. Sift out the coarse parts, use the fine powder in a mortar, and grind thoroughly with several people for five to seven days until it becomes extremely fine. Grind Bai Lian into a fine powder as well. For deer horn, avoid those that have naturally shed; use only those that still have the brain and bone intact. Cut them into two- or three-inch lengths, burn them to eliminate smoke, then grind and sift for a fine powder. </p>
<p>Combine two taels of finely ground Mai Fan Shi, two taels of Bai Lian powder, and four taels of deer horn ash. It is crucial to grind them to an extremely fine consistency for effectiveness.

<p>Before using, wash away any pus and blood with pig trotter soup, then dry the area with a clean cloth. Use a goose feather dipped in ointment to apply around the wound, covering all red areas while leaving the center about the size of a coin exposed. If the wound is not yet open, this method can help it heal from within; if it is already open, the pus will drain out like rushing water, and the wound will gradually close.</p>
<p>For longstanding wounds where muscle has rotted and tendons are exposed, apply a piece of old cloth with medicine over the wound, taking care not to break the inner membrane, which can also provide relief. When cleaning the wound, avoid touching the tender flesh and do not blow on it with your breath. </p>
<p>Also, avoid having anyone with underarm odor or menstruating pregnant women nearby while preparing the medicine. You can also boil a large bowl of good rice vinegar, store it in a ceramic container, and use it daily on the wound. If the medicine dries out over time, use the goose feather to lightly wipe the medicine with vinegar, ensuring it doesn&#39;t become tight.</p>

<p><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Realgar Detoxification Powder</strong>: Treats all kinds of boils, swellings, and severe toxic conditions. First, use this medicine two to three times, then follow with pig&#39;s trotter soup. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingredients</strong>: 4 taels of alum, 1 tael each of realgar and calcined cold water stone. Use 2 to 3 bowls of boiling water, while hot add 1 tael of the previous medicine. Wash the affected area and apply Taiyi ointment or Shenyi ointment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pig’s Trotter Soup</strong>: Treats all boils and toxic swellings, dispels toxic qi, and eliminates foul flesh. For any wound with an opening, use this soup for washing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Equal parts of: raw white angelica, yellow root without hearts, red peony root, qianghuo, bee’s nest with live bees, raw licorice, and others. Grind into coarse powder, adjusting the dosage according to the size of the boil. If the boil is large, increase the ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, take two front trotters of a wild pig weighing one jin, using only 3 liters of plain water to boil until soft. Divide the juice into two portions, clarifying the surface oil and removing the sediment and meat. For each usage, take 1 tael of medicine and add to the juice, then simmer with steady heat until boiling numerous times. Remove dregs, and use clean cloth to soak in the medicinal soup. Gently and gradually apply it to the wound; dead flesh and foul blood will wash away accordingly. After cleaning, dry the area with cloth. Avoid wind and do not let breath blown from the mouth touch it. Individuals with foul body odor, menstruating women, and chickens or dogs are not allowed to enter the patient&#39;s room. Avoid touching the wound with hands during washing. Many methods exist to wash abscesses, but this recipe is especially effective. The use of bee’s nest serves a purpose, driving out poison with poison.<a id="trans-426p" href="#orig-426p" class="marker">[426p]</a><br>Gather incense and disperse; cleanse sores that are festering and rotten. </p>
<p>Three qian each of Bai Zhi, Huo Xiang, Mao Xiang, Xiang Fu Zi, and Fang Feng; one qian each of Mu Xiang and Gan Cao. Prepare into one dose, using three bowls of water. Boil until it has reduced, strain, and wash the affected area.</p>
<p>For fumigation and washing: For all hair, places of pus, carbuncles, swollen lymph nodes, sores, or conditions accompanied by a foul odor that is unbearable, these are the worst afflictions. Whether already ruptured or not, small or large, urgent treatment is required. Use a handful of honeysuckle vine, pound finely, and filter its juice with ashless wine to drink. Apply the residue around the wound, using ground muscovite ointment for extra protection. You may also cut a larger opening to protect the wound above, waiting for it to produce pus. Then, thoroughly cleanse it with an absolute and pure wash like pig hoof broth, washing persistently for a duration of one or two hours. Following this, use the medicinal fumigation.</p>
<p>For the incense mixture, take two flavors: fine powder of sandalwood and fragrant maple. Mix these two in a pan evenly, rolling into balls the size of bullets. Then, take a censer and fashion a paper smoke tube for the opening. Like burning ambergris, use a slow fire to combust it, placing the tube firmly over the sore. The number of balls is not fixed; if tired, pause briefly, then resume fumigation. If pus has yet to emerge, it will appear; if it has emerged, let it dry, and wait for the flesh to heal before stopping. If there is still redness and swelling, continue to fumigate. Generally, the aim is to eliminate the foul odor.<a id="trans-427p" href="#orig-427p" class="marker">[427p]</a></p>

If the ulcer is dry, use a dying bamboo to dab bean oil, collecting the drips in a bowl, and mix this with the previous medicinal powder. Apply with a chicken feather; this will stop the pus, moisten the ulcer, and promote the growth of new flesh, yielding miraculous results.<a id="trans-432p" href="#orig-432p" class="marker">[432p]</a><br><strong>Divine Efficacy Angelica Ointment</strong> treats furuncles, carbuncles, and toxic sores, as well as burns and ulcerations. It is especially effective in alleviating pain and promoting healing. </p>
<p>Ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>2 taels of Angelica </li>
<li>4 taels of sesame oil </li>
<li>5 qian of white wax (using 1 tael of yellow wax is even more effective).</li>
</ul>
<p>First, fry the Angelica in oil until it turns dark black. Remove the residue, then add the wax to melt and combine, creating the ointment. Wax is the primary ingredient in this formula. Former practitioners have always emphasized that wax is a crucial remedy in surgery, promoting skin regeneration and pain relief, and helping to mend tendons and replenish blood—its benefits are countless. </p>
<p>It is commonly seen that those who frequently battle in lawsuits, after being struck, take a small amount of wax along with one to two bowls of alcohol. After a night&#39;s rest, their blood disperses and the pain ceases; in lighter cases, the issues resolve completely, and even severe cases, though ulcerated, heal easily. This demonstrates the significant power of wax, which users must not overlook!<a id="trans-433p" href="#orig-433p" class="marker">[433p]</a><br><strong>Magical Ointment</strong></p>
<p>This cures all kinds of poisonous sores and boils; its effects are miraculous.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bee&#39;s nest (preferably the finer parts) - finely chopped, </li>
<li>Almonds - 1 tael each,</li>
<li>Snake skin - cleaned and dried, </li>
<li>Radix Rehmanniae - 0.5 taels, </li>
<li>Astragalus - 7.5 qian,</li>
<li>Yellow lead - 5 taels, finely powdered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, combine the hemp oil with the messy hair in a silver pan over a fireplace, using gentle fire to slowly render the hair until it is thoroughly blended.</li>
<li>Add the almonds when the hair turns black; filter out the solids.</li>
<li>Pour the extracted oil back into the silver pan, then add the astragalus and radix rehmanniae; simmer on low heat for 1-2 hours.</li>
<li>After that, place the pan on a cooler part of the fire for half an hour, reducing the heat slightly.</li>
<li>Gradually incorporate the bee&#39;s nest and snake skin, stirring quickly with a willow branch.</li>
<li>Return the pan to the heat, stirring continuously until the mixture turns a yellowish-purple color.</li>
<li>Filter it again, then return to the pan and add the yellow lead, stirring vigorously. </li>
<li>Put the pan on the fire again and continuously stir for over a thousand turns until the medicinal oil becomes black, forming beads when dripped into water, indicating that the ointment is complete.<a id="trans-434p" href="#orig-434p" class="marker">[434p]</a><br>If the medicinal paste is too rare, boil it a little longer. It is essential to wait for the right condition before sealing it in porcelain ware for storage. If there is a fear of accidental overheating that makes it too hard to use, add a bit of wax while simmering and mix in sesame oil. Seal it in porcelain, steam it above water, and stir it while hot until homogeneous, then store it for use. Once the paste is prepared, place the porcelain container in a clean basin of water to eliminate the fire&#39;s residual toxicity for a full day and night, then leave it to rest for three days before use. Preparing this paste is very challenging in terms of heat; one must be patient and observe the fire closely, as too fierce a flame will cause it to burn. Be extremely cautious.

Remove the herb residues and filter the oil to clarify it. Clean the pot of any remaining debris and bring it to a boil again, then gradually add the yellow crocus until the paste reaches the consistency where it does not disperse in water droplets.<a id="trans-435p" href="#orig-435p" class="marker">[435p]</a><br>The Daoist Immortal&#39;s Taiyi ointment treats boils and sores of all kinds, regardless of how long they have been present or whether they have formed pus. It is also suitable for treating snake bites, tiger wounds, centipede stings, dog bites, and injuries from fire or sharp instruments, which can be taken internally or applied externally. For sores on the back, first wash the wound with warm water to clean it, dry with a soft cloth, then apply the ointment on a red silk cloth to the wound, followed by cold water ingestion; if there is blood stagnation, use warm water to wash it down. For red or white discharges, take with wine and angelica; for coughs or throat constrictions, use new cotton to wrap the ointment and place it in the mouth to dissolve.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.5 pounds of asphalt</li>
<li>2 ounces each of Xuanwu, yellow wax</li>
<li>1 ounce each of myrrh and frankincense, to be ground separately</li>
<li>4 to 7 seeds of tortoise shell, sliced and ground</li>
<li>100 castor beans, ground</li>
<li>2 ounces of sesame oil in summer, 3 ounces in spring and autumn, and 4 ounces in winter</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:<br>Firstly, combine asphalt and Xuanwu in a pot and melt them, stirring with branches of Sophora and willow until it reaches a dark, charred color. Strain through cotton, pour the asphalt into a basin of water, let it cool into blocks, and weigh out 2 pounds of the pure substance. Then return it to the pot, melt it down again, and add sesame oil, yellow wax, castor bean paste, and the ground tortoise shell. Continuously stir with the willow branch, ensuring the mixture can drop into water without sticking to the hands, and can be pulled to resemble golden threads. If it becomes too hard, add a little oil; if too soft, add more asphalt. Once the proper consistency is achieved, add the powdered myrrh and take the pot off the heat. Stir vigorously with the willow branch hundreds of times, then filter the ointment with coarse cloth in the basin, pulling it into golden strands while frequently changing the water for a day. Finally, use a small scoop to store it.</p>
<p>For injuries resembling falls from horses or vehicles, heat the affected area to the bone and test for tenderness, bathing it in hot water multiple times until the stagnation of blood dissipates. For children&#39;s spleen disorders, apply to the affected area, for diarrhea apply on the stomach, and for coughs apply on the back.<a id="trans-437p" href="#orig-437p" class="marker">[437p]</a><br><strong>Good Response Ointment</strong> 【From &#39;Achieving Effect&#39;】<br>This remedy treats various types of malignant sores and swellings, carbuncles, boils, dental swellings, bone fractures, sprains, knife and axe wounds, bruises from beating, snake and insect bites, dog and horse bites, burns from boiling water and fire, lacquer sores, scabies, and more; applying it will lead to healing. It also treats women who experience soreness from breastfeeding; for this, take pills the size of a paulownia seed and swallow twenty pills with fresh spring water.

<p>Take a porcelain mortar and add one jin of sesame oil, soaking the herbs overnight. Slow-cook the herbs over a gentle flame until they turn black. Then, add chopped spring onion and wild hair, cooking for a short time. Filter through raw silk to remove residue, leaving one tael of herbal oil. </p>
<p>Further heat the filtered oil over a slow flame, adding the yellow lead. Stir continuously with long willow or locust branches until slight smoke appears. Lift the mortar and let drops of the medicinal mixture fall onto the water&#39;s surface; they should form beads that do not disperse. This indicates that it has turned into an ointment. If it does not bead, continue to heat it. </p>

First, prick the area around the sore and mix the powdered medicine with oil to apply inside the wound. Seal it with scarlet silk; within a few days, the carbuncle will naturally exit. If the sore has penetrated into the abdomen causing nausea and vomiting, drink juice from Cang Erzi.</p>

<p>Toad fat pill for treating boils and abscesses: if toxic qi attacks the heart causing a near-fatal condition, use a needle to pierce the sore directed towards the heart. If pain is felt and blood comes out, insert the pill. If successive punctures near the heart side cause no pain or bleeding, urgently needle the Baihui point. If there is pain and blood, insert the pill. If there is no blood, use the hot blood of a loved one as a substitute; it is still effective in three out of ten cases. Initially, when it appears, there are no failures. Generally, boils most severely arise on the chest, back, and head. Initially, they itch and hurt intermittently, sink like a nail, and have a root that makes it feel like it is shaking. Severe heat and aversion to food accompany them.</p>
<p>Ingredients include: southern star (dried plant), winter flower, castor bean seeds, yellow cinnabar, and white arsenic, each one penny; five parts of angelica; ten centipedes with heads and legs removed. These should be ground into a very fine powder, mixed with fresh toad fat to form balls the size of millet grains. Each time a boil appears, first use a needle to pierce it, ensuring no pain is felt. If blood comes out, insert the pill; if pain is felt, there is no need to use it again. If still no pain is felt, continue to poke along the path of the sore until blood is seen to indicate pain, then stop. The original sore will also ache; apply a medicated plaster to have pus drain naturally. </p>
<p>For the pill method, use a fine silver tube about three inches long; puncture down to the painful area of the sore with the needle, then push the medicine contained in a fine silver wire within the tube to the painful location.</p>

<p>Single prescription:</p>
<p>Yuan Zhi Wine: Treats all abscesses, carbuncles, and toxic boils. If there is stagnation due to dead blood, it will not be painful unless applied; if internal evil is present, then pain will be unbearable, but applying will relieve it; if blood is congested within, causing internal heat that feels oppressive, the hand cannot approach; applying will surely bring relief. If there is deficiency of qi and cold blood, leading to ulceration that does not close, or if emotional distress is accumulated internally, the remedy will cure it. Yuan Zhi is used without regard to amount; soak, pound to a pulp, and dry to a powder. Mix three qian of this powder with one cup of wine, strain, and drink it, applying the residue to the affected area.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: When the energy of the abscess is stagnant, it should be removed with needles. When the energy is strong and the blood is congested, it should be drained using stones. In the eastern regions, the people eat fish and salty food, leading to abscess-related diseases, which should be treated with stone therapy. When the abscess has no definitive location, palpation does not yield results; it appears and disappears unpredictably. One should puncture the area next to the Taiyin point and the two points of the Jingmai. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: In acupuncture, if one does not penetrate properly, essence may leak; if one punctures incorrectly, it may lead to energy stagnation. Essence leakage results in worsening conditions and distress, while energy stagnation leads to the formation of abscesses. When treating the evil of abscesses, do not confront it head-on; it can easily change nature. If pus forms, the path may collapse, unsettling the area, leading to dispersion. For any excesses of yin and yang causing abscesses, one should focus on draining them. A fine needle should be as sharp as a sword&#39;s edge to draw out substantial pus. </p>
<p>The onset of illness is often unpredictable, influenced by emotions like joy and anger, irregular eating habits, insufficient yin energy, excessive yang energy, and stagnant nutrients, which lead to abscess formation. When yin and yang are blocked, and two heats clash, they turn into pus. Can a small needle extract it? Qi Bo said: To treat small issues with small methods yields little effect; treating larger issues with large methods often brings more harm. Therefore, once pus and blood have formed, only stone therapy and fine needles can draw them out. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: A swelling in the neck makes it hard to look up or down; cheek swelling can pull the ear, treat it with the governing bone point. For a swollen throat that makes speech difficult, treat it with the Tian Zhu point.<a id="trans-530p" href="#orig-530p" class="marker">[530p]</a><br>Swelling of the lips and sores, governed by the Yangbai point.<br>Swelling and pain in the cheeks, governed by the Tianchuang point.<br>Swelling of the head and neck that inhibits speech, governed by the Tianrong point.<br>Swelling of the body, governed by the Guanmen point.<br>Fullness and pain beneath the chest, with swelling of the breasts, governed by the Rugen point.<a id="trans-531p" href="#orig-531p" class="marker">[531p]</a><br>Swelling in the face and eye abscess, needling the valley point to induce bleeding immediately.<br>If the nose of the ox is swollen, one can needle the top; do not attack it hard, as doing so would lead to death. For sores, the Yin orifice governs it.<br>When the pulse of wind becomes severe, it indicates a severe sore; the Yin orifice governs it. For the severe sore, Shangqiu governs it.<br>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: when the abscess or sore begins to form, there may be great pain or slight pain, or it may emerge like a grain of rice; one should quickly cut the mouth to eliminate its poison, using the bamboo horse moxibustion technique. However, there is no record of this moxibustion method in &quot;Thousand Gold&quot;; the earliest documentation is in the &quot;Emergency Moxibustion Method&quot; authored by the renowned person Wen Renqiannian during the Song Dynasty, which includes a special section on bamboo horse moxibustion. One can also burn moxa directly on the affected area, and for more severe cases, moxibustion should be done all around the center, at least one or two hundred strong burns, and then apply medicine, which is very effective.<br>The bamboo horse moxibustion method can cure all types of sores and ulcers without exception. Have the patient lean on a table with their elbow, straightening the wrist; use a strip of slender bamboo, measuring from the bend at the wrist to the tip of the middle finger, cutting off the excess and not measuring the fingernail. Then, take a bamboo pole, have the patient undress, and sit firmly on it, with two people lifting them off the ground, ensuring their feet do not touch the ground, and have two others support them, keeping them upright. The bamboo strip measured should be placed from the sitting position on the bamboo pole down to the coccyx, then directly along the spine to the end of the measured strip; use ink to mark this point, which is merely for positioning and is not an acupuncture point.<a id="trans-532p" href="#orig-532p" class="marker">[532p]</a><br>Instead, use thin bamboo strips as a measuring tool to gauge the knuckle joint of the patient’s middle finger, with the distance between the two horizontal lines as the standard. For males, measure on the left; for females, on the right. Cut it to one standard length, then measure from the marked point on both sides to find another standard length; the ends will indicate the acupuncture points. Each point should be cauterized five to seven times. If an abscess appears on the left, cauterize the right; if on the right, cauterize the left; if severe, cauterize both sides. This is because these two points correspond with the heart meridian; all abscesses and swellings are due to the stagnation of heart fire and poison. Cauterizing here allows the heart fire to circulate and the poison to dissipate. This method has repeatedly demonstrated its life-saving effectiveness.</p>
<p>For abscesses that have or have not burst, take three sheng of fragrant bean and mash it with a little water to form a paste. Shape this paste into a cake according to the size of the swelling, three-tenths of an inch thick. If the wound has a hole, do not cover it. Place the bean cake on top and burn mugwort sticks above it, ensuring it remains warm but does not burn the flesh. If there’s heat and pain, replace it urgently. The affected area will feel lighter and more comfortable. Cauterize twice a day. If a hole is already present, letting out the juice is most beneficial. This is the bean cake cauterization method, mentioned in the &quot;Thousand Gold Supplement,&quot; Volume Twenty-Three, addressing the same topic but with slight differences in wording.</p>
<p>The &quot;Three Causes Formula&quot; states that when an abscess or swelling is first felt, it should be covered with a damp paper. Looking carefully, the first dry area indicates the head. Place sliced garlic on the head and cauterize with a large mugwort torch three times, then replace with another piece of garlic. Cauterize until the pain is relieved, or continue until pain is felt to stop. Generally, a hundred cauterizations is the standard. It is most crucial to recognize early and begin cauterizing promptly.<a id="trans-533p" href="#orig-533p" class="marker">[533p]</a><br>If there is a head, there is no need to cover it with paper. If there are ten or so heads that appear in one area, prepare a paste of garlic, make a thin cake, and apply it over the head, then place mugwort on the cake for moxibustion. The &quot;Direct Instruction Method&quot; states: if small dots appear for one or two days, urgently apply garlic slices at the center and perform moxibustion with small mugwort sticks five times and then stop. The &quot;Hejian Six Writings&quot; states: for all sores and ulcers, one must differentiate the pathways and regions, and the amount of qi and blood, as well as the distance to the acupoints. </p>
<p>For those arising from the back, select from the five acupoints of the Sun pathway: Zhi Yin is located on the outer side of the little toe, away from the nail edge like a chive leaf; Tong Gu is found at the indentation before the outer side of the little toe; Shu Gu is located at the indentation behind the outer side of the little toe; Kun Lun is at the indentation above the outer ankle on the heel bone; Wei Zhong is in the middle of the knee crease near the artery. </p>
<p>For those arising from the temples, select from the five acupoints of the Shao Yang pathway: Qiao Yin is at the tip of the little toe and the next toe, away from the nail edge like a chive leaf; Xia Xi is located between the little toe and the next toe at the indentation of the joint; Lin Qi is found at the indentation behind the joint of the little toe and the next toe; Yang Fu is four inches above the outer ankle on the front end of the fibula bone; Yang Ling Quan is one inch below the knee on the outside edge in a depression.<a id="trans-534p" href="#orig-534p" class="marker">[534p]</a><br>Those with beard-like growths should select from the five points of the Yangming channel: The &quot;Li Dui&quot; point is located between the big toe and the second toe on the foot, with the nail cut short like chives; the &quot;Nei Ting&quot; point is in the middle groove between the big toe and the second toe; the &quot;Xian Gu&quot; point is located at the back of the joint of the big toe and second toe; the &quot;Chong Yang&quot; point is five inches above the top of the foot, in the space between the bones, three inches away from the protruding bone; the &quot;Jie Xi&quot; point is one inch and five-tenths behind the Chong Yang point, in the middle of the wrist.</p>
<p>For issues arising from the brain, only the &quot;Jue Gu&quot; point should be used, which is located three inches above the outer ankle in the artery. For early-stage carbuncles or abscesses that feel slightly swollen, with hardened skin and a deep pulse without pain, one should perform external moxibustion to expel the pathogenic qi. The classics state that for issues occurring below the surface, moxibustion is indicated. If one feels a slight hardness without pain, urgent moxibustion is required, as the pathogenic qi has deeply settled; if it is shallow, moxibustion should not be performed. If there is pus, moxibustion is also not indicated; needling is warranted.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;De Xiao Fang&quot;: When a carbuncle or abscess initially flares up and grows larger, place a piece of damp paper on the wound, and the point that dries first is the primary location. First, wash it with water to remove any salty skin, and place a large pen-tube aligned over the primary location, then insert a large leech inside. Frequently pour cold water over it; the leech should suck out the pus and blood from the precise point, with the skin wrinkling and the tissue turning pale, indicating that the poison has dispersed effectively. If the poison is large and the leech is small, three to four leeches should be used to achieve results. If bleeding does not stop, apply mud from lotus stems to the area.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Zi Sheng Fang&quot;: Those skilled in treating carbuncles and abscesses typically use moxibustion on the wound two to three hundred times, with all cases achieving resolution.<a id="trans-535p" href="#orig-535p" class="marker">[535p]</a><br>When using moxa sticks for small ailments, a gentler approach causes less fear of the treatment; if used excessively, the effects will surely manifest. When a hard, unyielding lump is encountered, known as a &quot;stone sore,&quot; apply strong moxibustion over it to break apart the stone within. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan,&quot; when a sore first appears on the back, signifying potential development, it is red, hot, swollen, and painful. First, cover it with moist paper, then observe where it dries first—that spot indicates the head of the sore. Take garlic, slice it into pieces about the thickness of three coins, place it on the head, and perform strong moxibustion three times, replacing with a new slice of garlic each time. Apply moxibustion until the pain subsides; if there is no pain, continue until it begins to hurt. It is best to treat early. In one to two days, ten treatments yield ten recoveries; in three to four days, six to seven recoveries; by five to six days, three to four recoveries. After ten or more days, moxibustion is no longer advisable. </p>
<p>If multiple heads arise in one spot, crush garlic into a paste and form a thin cake. Place it on the head and burn moxa over it, which can also yield effective results. If a red swelling first appears, and there is a yellow, corn-like head in the middle, take a single clove of garlic, cut off both ends, and slice the middle part to place on the sore head. Apply moxibustion fourteen to a maximum of forty-nine times. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Heart Method of Danxi,&quot; the emergence of sores is either due to internal accumulated heat or external cold combined with internal heat. By applying moxibustion to the site of development to disperse its toxicity, early treatment can change a deep issue into a shallow one, alleviating severity into mildness.<a id="trans-536p" href="#orig-536p" class="marker">[536p]</a><br>All methods of moxibustion are good, but the riding bamboo horse moxibustion method is particularly crucial, as it prevents ailments before they manifest. If moxibustion is applied excessively, one should take powdered milk internally to prevent the fire from entering the heart. The &quot;Medical Cliff Original General” states: sores that enter from the outside should not be treated with moxibustion; those that emerge from the inside should be treated. External invasions should be expelled rather than treated internally, while internal discharges should be guided outward. Therefore, the classic says: &quot;If it is trapped, moxibustion should be applied.&quot; If moxibustion does not cause pain, one should cease when it becomes painful. If it does not hurt, it must have already reached the ulcer, hence the lack of pain; afterwards, it reaches healthy flesh, hence the pain arises. If moxibustion causes pain, one should stop once the pain alleviates. If it is painful, it must first reach the pre-ulcerative stage; subsequently, it affects areas about to ulcerate, thus not inducing pain. </p>
<p>According to Xue Ji&#39;s medical case studies, Wu states: &quot;For moxibustion with garlic cakes, garlic&#39;s spicy, warm, and toxic properties primarily disperse sores and abscesses, using the heat to activate the medicinal effects.&quot; For those who only use moxa cones, this can be applied to stubborn ulcers, or similar conditions. For all cases of red, swollen, and darkly toxic sores, moxibustion with garlic and moxa together is ideal. </p>
<p>In treating abscesses, furuncles, and carbuncles, if initial moxibustion causes pain, it indicates the toxic gases are superficial; if there is no pain, the toxicity is deeper. Both cases should involve internal medication to eliminate toxins and pus, and external applications to disinfect. Generally, abscesses should not be painless; if they are overwhelmingly painful, or if one is disoriented and feels no pain, treatment becomes difficult.<a id="trans-537p" href="#orig-537p" class="marker">[537p]</a><br>Generally, for those who undergo garlic isolation moxibustion, it does not matter whether the condition is severe or mild; the pathogenic energy has no place to reside, and the vital energy remains intact. However, if sores appear on the crown of the head, one should use the bamboo horse method and moxibustion at the acupuncture point Zusanli. Sores and ulcers must manifest externally if there are internal issues; those on the outside should be drawn out, while internal ones should be dispersed and drained. The effects of moxibustion are significant. If toxic energy becomes stagnant and blood coagulates, lighter cases might be relieved with medicinal herbs, but in severe cases, medicine cannot work effectively. Dongyuan stated: If one does not use acupuncture or cautery, the toxic energy cannot be resolved. Therefore, those skilled in treating toxins must use garlic isolation moxibustion. Using harsh, cold remedies to dispel toxins can be effective for those with substantial internal heat, but for those who are weak and have deficient energy, failure is inevitable. Additionally, if toxic energy is hidden, whether due to age or weakness, or from taking harmful medications that further deplete energy, resulting in pus that does not discharge, one must rely on the power of fire to achieve success. Generally, in acupuncture and moxibustion, if there is no discharge, one should draw out the stagnant toxins; if it has discharged, one should restore the Yang energy and eliminate cold pathogenic influence, allowing the sore to close naturally. This method is particularly effective for treating sores in the limbs due to insufficient energy and blood. For such cases, the aforementioned moxibustion method is adequate for healing. In cases of severe abscess, moxibustion is especially advisable, as heat toxins trapped within create a barrier, and without proper release, they cannot be dispersed. If one is in a poor and isolated situation with no medicine available, garlic isolation moxibustion is particularly convenient, changing the garlic slices every three uses, typically capping at around one hundred uses.<a id="trans-538p" href="#orig-538p" class="marker">[538p]</a><br>Using garlic for its pungency can disperse, and using mugwort for its fiery properties can promote penetration. If these methods are applied through moxibustion, the sore will inevitably fester and break down, followed by applying a miraculous ointment, leading to self-healing in no time. This method not only prevents the sore from becoming large but also preserves the internal flesh, allowing the sore&#39;s opening to close easily, showing remarkable effects. Danxi said: &quot;The head is where all yang energies converge; therefore, mugwort should be used in small and limited amounts.&quot;</p>
<p>For sores that do not break, they should be prodded to break. For those not festering, they should be supplemented to promote festering, preventing internal attacks. When the pus forms, timely needling will lead to healing in less than a few weeks. Patients often fear the pain of needles and refuse treatment, or they worry about damaging the flesh. They do not realize that though the sore emerges in thin flesh, if the pus forms, it will swell a couple of inches high, and the skin of the sore will thicken; using a needle, the depth should not exceed two-tenths of an inch. If it arises on the back, the swelling may be two to three inches high, and the needle should only enter about an inch deep. Moreover, when the affected flesh is already damaged, what pain is there? What is there to worry about in terms of injury?</p>
<p>For timid or weak individuals, or those suffering from bone-related abscesses, waiting for the pus to drain naturally often leads to severe ruptures that cannot heal and result in the loss of vital energy and blood, leading to many deaths. Once a sore has formed pus, the skin should not be loosely vented, yet some foolish individuals wait for it to rupture on their own. They fail to understand that younger and more robust individuals might be able to self-resolve. However, for the elderly and weak, with depleted vital energy and blood, or those who excessively induce attacks, not using needling allows the pathogenic toxicity to exploit the situation and attack internally, leading to severe consequences.<a id="trans-539p" href="#orig-539p" class="marker">[539p]</a><br>If poison has settled in the limbs, and the acupuncture is not effective, then the decay will be deep and significant, making it difficult to contain. When poison accumulates in critical areas such as the cheeks, neck, chest, and abdomen, regardless of whether the person is strong or weak, urgent puncturing is required; otherwise, it will be hard to treat. Generally, the manifestations of sores and ulcers vary in severity, with deep or shallow presentations. Shallow ones are swollen, raised, and soft, arising from the blood vessels; deep ones, however, are swollen, hardened, and arise from the tendons and bones. There are also those that arise from the marrow, where the skin and flesh remain unchanged. Thus, the ancients devised methods where shallow cases should be treated with scraping and deep cases should be pierced, to eliminate stagnant blood at the onset of the poison accumulation for easier resolution. If pus has formed and the vital energy is strong, it may naturally drain out. For those who are weak and timid, needling is not recommended, as few escape regret. When sores and ulcers penetrate the membrane, there is a ten to one chance of death; even using major tonics cannot save them, thus this serves as a warning to await the pus to drain out. Therefore, Dongyuan states: if the toxic qi cannot be resolved and the pus and stagnation cannot be released, and time passes without treatment, it will turn inward and harm the internal organs. Once the internal decay occurs, how can one hope for survival? I will share one or two examples for my colleagues and alert the patients to be cautious. </p>
<p>If treating symptoms of insufficient vital energy, at the onset of the condition, one should internally use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to warmly nourish the spleen and stomach; externally, use mulberry branches and green onions for steaming, to help restore the yang energy for natural dissipation.<a id="trans-540p" href="#orig-540p" class="marker">[540p]</a><br>If it has been a long time without pus formation, one should employ the previous two methods as supplements to hasten it. If pus has already formed but does not drain, moxa should be applied at the center with a few cones to draw it out, followed by taking a decoction of &quot;Ten Complete Tonics.&quot; </p>
<p>It is also noted: if there are ten or more pepper eyes in the abscess, or it resembles a honeycomb or lotus pod, and the pus and blood do not emerge, use a needle to puncture it both horizontally and vertically. If there are no such pepper eyes, simply puncture straight in to extract the pus without splitting. Applying moxa to each pepper eye is also a good method, and it is not necessary to split.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is stated: an abscess has thin skin and a high swelling, often with pepper-like granules; while a carbuncle has tough skin, resembling a cow&#39;s neck. When an abscess is ripe, it is appropriate to use a needle, preferably one made of horse bit iron, shaped like a chive leaf, sharp on both sides, capable of slicing five or six tenths of an inch, used to eradicate toxic blood. One must first apply moxa before puncturing. When a carbuncle is ripe, it is suitable for cauterization; a silver spatula about two inches wide and six inches long can be heated until red-hot and quickly applied to the toxic area to cauterize, resulting in the pus being expelled.</p>
<p>For already formed toxic gas, it is advisable to use a tool to hasten the emergence of pus; once the pus is formed, one must check its ripeness, depth, and state before using a needle. If the pus is ripe and a needle is used, the qi and blood will already have flowed out, making it difficult for additional pus to form; however, if the pus is ripe and not punctured, the necrosis will deepen, and the wound will be hard to close. If the wound is deep and the needle is shallow, the internal pus will not exit, and external blood will instead leak out; if the wound is shallow and the needle is deep, while the internal pus may exit, healthy flesh may become damaged.<a id="trans-541p" href="#orig-541p" class="marker">[541p]</a><br>If the vital energy is weak, one must first nourish before puncturing. Once the pus is released, the various symptoms will subside. However, if the pus is expelled and there is renewed pain, or if there is restlessness and vomiting, this is due to a deficiency in stomach energy, and urgent nourishment is required. If there is severe heat and toxins from back sores, with the central flesh darkened, internally use medicines to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and externally apply black gold ointment to the darkened area. As the red areas gradually rise and the dark areas gradually lower, within six or seven days, a boundary will be formed between the red and dark areas, with cracks appearing as if marked by a knife, and the dark flesh will begin to deteriorate. One should use fine needles to carefully cut away, ensuring that the patient feels no pain and no blood is seen. Even if there are cracks and pus has not fully flowed, or even if the pus and water have come out but there is still pain, this indicates that the inner pathways are not yet open, and needles should be used to draw it out along the cracks. If there is decay in the flesh between the shoulder blades and pus is released but swelling and pain persist, this indicates the presence of toxic filaments obstructing it, and the pus has not been fully released. It is especially important to draw this out. If the vital energy is weak and there is excessive use or loss of energy, and the affected area is not painful, or if the flesh appears to be dying, urgent warming and nourishing of the spleen and stomach is needed; there may still be a chance for recovery. In the end, pure nourishing medicines should be employed to help consolidate the healing.<a id="trans-542p" href="#orig-542p" class="marker">[542p]</a><br>If one recklessly uses knives and needles, causing flesh to be cut and blood to flow, then the vital energy has nowhere to attach, and both the vital energy and blood become increasingly deficient, leading to greater injury of the original energy. How can one expect to grow flesh and promote healing in such a state? </p>
<p>In the practice of acupuncture and moxibustion, there are rules concerning forbidden points and prohibited practices, including the prohibitions of using needles on certain days or during certain times. Violating these rules can lead to difficulties in healing, for this reasoning is indeed sound. However, when wounds and lesions have already harmed the vital energy and blood, and the muscles are damaged, it is better to confront and seize the problem in a straightforward manner. This is not to be compared to the acupuncture of a healthy individual, so what prohibitions need to be observed?</p>
<p>&quot;The Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: In the case of wounds and sores where poisonous energy cannot be resolved and pus and clots cannot be drained, the attack turns inward. When the interior has already decayed, how can one expect healing? The dangers from critical conditions can arise suddenly, with peril lurking at every turn: abdominal abscesses, urinary obstructions, chest and abdominal distension, lip sores, throat paralysis, and swollen and blocked throats lead to swift catastrophe. Patients must be vigilant!</p>
<p>As for the technique of &quot;earthworm needle,&quot; it is used to treat initial occurrences of boils and sores. First, a pen tube is inserted into the body of the earthworm, aligning the tube&#39;s opening with the sore&#39;s head, allowing the earthworm to suck out the pus and blood, dispersing the poison effectively.<a id="trans-543p" href="#orig-543p" class="marker">[543p]</a><br>If the sore is large, it must be changed out for three or four strips. If you suck on the right point, the pestilence will surely die; this has been tested repeatedly. If the bleeding does not stop, apply mud from the lotus root&#39;s joint. If the sore&#39;s head has not yet formed clearly, apply mud from the edge of the well to the part that has dried first.</p>
<p>For initial small points of carbuncles and sores that appear, within one or two days, urgently cut a whole garlic bulb horizontally like a coin and place it at the center, then prompt moxa treatment five times and stop. If the shape is somewhat larger, use yellow straw paper soaked in alcohol and apply it entirely, recognizing the dried part as the sinew. Treat the drier part with moxa, or you can apply it to both drier parts, but limit it to five or seven applications.<a id="trans-544p" href="#orig-544p" class="marker">[544p]</a><br>Another method involves bending one&#39;s fingers to feel around the affected area. When you encounter a painful spot, that is the root. Press deeply there, and if you feel lighter, then apply moxibustion. Additionally, apply it in other areas. If there is significant swelling, pound garlic into a cake, dry it, and dip it in vinegar for moxibustion. Replace it frequently with hot packs, or use an iron to heat the garlic cake and press it frequently. If you notice the pain radiating, cover the affected area with a soft cloth to prevent the energy from dispersing, and wait a little before applying medicine.</p>
<p>For abscesses that have swollen greatly, resembling the shape of a turtle, observe the position of the head; first, apply moxibustion to the front legs, then to the tail. If there are red veins that are tight and long, treat them from the end, leaving the head and the two back legs untouched. If you apply moxibustion to the entire area, not only will the heat become trapped, but the poison will also not disperse and will invade deeper.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about the diagnosis, use three parts of white angelica, one part each of Sichuan pepper and mulberry bark, and ten pieces of green onion whites. Boil them in freshly drawn water with half a cup of vinegar, and wash the area for a while until the veins appear, so you can identify the head and tail.</p>
<p>Fermented black beans can treat ulcers and solid swellings that do not suppurate, as well as non-healing stubborn sores. Use Jiangxi fermented black beans powdered into fine powder, mix with saliva to form cakes about the size of a coin and three-tenths of an inch thick. Place the cake on the afflicted area and apply moxibustion using mugwort on top of the cake.<a id="trans-545p" href="#orig-545p" class="marker">[545p]</a><br>Biscuit: Use saliva to make it the size of a sore, and with mouthwash, adjust it to cover the affected area. Place mugwort on top and burn it. If the sore is not fully formed, it will vanish upon application; if it has already formed, it may not completely disappear, but the toxicity will be greatly reduced. Previous practitioners have all claimed it has miraculous effects, so it should not be overlooked!</p>
<p>Pill of Thunderfire is a wonderful remedy for internal carbuncles, effective for inducing sweat. When a sore is first noticed and no sweating medicine has been taken, after several days, external symptoms will cease, either affecting the chest and abdomen or the sides, with red swelling. This indicates that toxic air has entered within, manifesting as internal carbuncles. This method should be used to induce sweat so that the toxins can be released. </p>
<p>First, prepare a water bucket and an iron pot. Have the patient lie on their side over the bucket, protecting them with clothing and blankets to prevent loss of steam. Then take a heated river stone until it glows red and place it in the pot. Put the pot into the bucket and sprinkle vinegar onto it to create steam for sweating. If the sweat does not penetrate, increase the heat and add more vinegar; ensure that the swollen area sweats through, without requiring the entire body to sweat.</p>
<p>Aconite biscuits treat ulcers when there is deficiency in qi and blood, unable to retract, or when wind evil attacks, preventing qi and blood from circulating in the sore, thus failing to contract. Use processed aconite, peeled and ground, combined with saliva to form a biscuit, and place this on the sore. Burn mugwort on top of the biscuit daily, a few times, ensuring it feels slightly warm without causing pain. Adjust the biscuit&#39;s consistency with saliva to keep the sore moist.<a id="trans-546p" href="#orig-546p" class="marker">[546p]</a><br>&quot;The &#39;Principles of Treatment&#39; states: The method of acupuncture for treating carbuncles and sores involves the dispersal of red threads, with possible accumulation of toxic blood. Use a piece of fine ceramic, break it into sharp pieces, take one piece, split it with a chopstick, and secure it with a thread. With your fingers, lightly press the chopstick to align the sharp edge with the affected area, hanging about an inch above it. Then, use another chopstick to repeatedly strike the head of the first chopstick, allowing toxic blood to be released upon puncture. If the toxicity is deep within the belly, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Moxibustion is a method to break up blockages and hard masses. If there is a small white bump, like a grain of millet, surrounded by slight swelling like a coin, moxa should be applied directly to the grain for fourteen or fifteen treatments. If treated within three days, it will only form a sore and disperse; if treated after three days, the swelling will gradually decrease, so it is advisable to apply more moxibustion. If the moxa burns the area, the heat can extend the blockage, and if the treatment area ulcerates first, the toxicity will lessen, hopefully preventing further spread and avoiding damage to muscles, bones, and the blood.</p>
<p>When it is said that moxibustion is painless, it means that if it’s applied to skin and flesh that isn’t damaged, it will hurt; but if it reaches the toxic area, it will not hurt. Therefore, the heat must reach the toxic area to be effective. When it’s said that moxibustion causes pain, it means that the initial application to the toxic area is painless, but it hurts when the heat reaches healthy flesh; thus, the heat must reach healthy flesh to be effective.</p>
<p>Those who are afraid of moxibustion may use a clove of garlic, or a fermented soybean cake, or a paste made from mashed pepper, ginger, and salt, about the thickness of three coins, spread with moxa and treated. If it gets hot, replace it with a fresh cake, which can also aid in dispersing the condition.&quot;<a id="trans-547p" href="#orig-547p" class="marker">[547p]</a><br>Cauterization is intended for treatment; only the head is where all yang energies converge, and the moxa should be small and few. If it involves the lesser yang regions, it is especially inadvisable to cauterize, as excessive cauterization may lead to no remedy. There are also instances of death resulting from cauterization. This occurs due to severe deficiency; solitary yang approaches extinction, and its pulse is bound to be floating, rapid, and large, while the spirit is bound to be short and murky, lacking the ability to withstand the fire&#39;s heat, which naturally leads to danger.</p>
<p>Liu Zonghou said: This refers to the early onset of boils and sores, where cauterization is advisable. However, for longstanding sores that cause pain, which often have continuous pus without an odor and no decayed flesh inside, it is more appropriate to soak with aconite, cut into large pieces, about two to three fen thick, and place them on the sore for moxa cauterization, while also taking internal medicinal remedies. Cauterization should be repeated every two to three days, and after five to seven times, the muscle will naturally fill in. For sores with foul pus and deep-rooted issues, the Guo family uses a combination of flour, sulfur, and garlic, all ground together. Depending on the size of the sore, form them into patties about three fen thick, and apply moxa cauterization twenty-one times, replacing it after each treatment. After four to five days, use the Qingxia pill and Xinxiao pill, alternating their use, and insert them into the sore until all decayed flesh is gone and healthy flesh emerges. Then, apply a consolidating medicine and take internal remedies suited to the condition, and with proper regulation, healing will follow.</p>
<p>Therefore, cauterization is not only appropriate at the initial onset of a sore. Generally, in the early stages, cauterization is indicated, and it is essential to supplement with medicines that contrast the condition while sweating and reducing. Even when cauterizing cold sores, effective internal remedies must be applied. If contrary treatments are used, not only will recovery fail, but it may also lead to the onset of other diseases.<a id="trans-548p" href="#orig-548p" class="marker">[548p]</a><br><strong>Needling and Cauterization</strong></p>
<p>When using needling and cauterization, first examine the depth and severity of the abscess and whether the pus is formed or not. A raised and soft area corresponds to the blood vessels; a flat and firm area relates to the tendons. If the skin color is indistinct, it originates from the bone marrow. For lightly raised areas, use a copper needle to incise them. If the abscess has just begun with white granules, it can be resolved; if it grows like a beehive, then cauterize the initial white granules and four or five surrounding areas. For those at the level of the skin, if the abscess is flat and shallow, it is appropriate to use a fire needle for cauterization. The needles should be round, similar to chopsticks or weft threads, thicker, with a rounded flat head, each around six to seven inches long, and two alike. Dip in fragrant oil and heat in charcoal until red hot, then cauterize near the base of the wound, angled into the softer area. If one cauterization does not penetrate, a second will yield pus. Cauterization at the wound opening is known as &quot;hot sore&quot;; pus flows without needing pressure to suppress it, using threads to keep the wound open. It was once common to use paper twist or freshly harvested root of the ox knee, sized to the wound, slightly scraping the skin, and tying one end with thread. It is better to use items like emerald green or pus-dispersing pills, mixing them with glutinous rice into soft strips, observing the depth for application, and externally applying detoxifying ointment. If the wound poison has not fully formed, cauterization may disperse it; if it has become ulcerated but not ruptured, needling can resolve it, but care must be taken to use the appropriate method.<a id="trans-549p" href="#orig-549p" class="marker">[549p]</a><br>If one is to use a needle to cauterize but fails to do so, then the poison finds no outlet, pus collects and erodes the mucous membrane, rotting tendons and damaging bones, making it difficult to avoid. If the poison is deep and the needle is shallow, the pus cannot be expelled; if the poison is superficial and the cauterization is deep, it harms the healthy flesh. If not handled correctly, further issues arise, causing more pain. If an abscess has festered and does not heal over time, or if a chronic ulcer alternates between opening and closing, or if the mouth of the abscess does not close, it is all due to cold stagnation that prevents contraction, as well as cauterization from within and without the ulcer. </p>
<p>When an abscess is just beginning and when pus appears, with redness and swelling presenting, one should use a heated iron needle to cauterize the area and prick around it, and then the redness and swelling will shrink. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compilation&quot; states: &quot;The cauterization technique is best applied when the ulcer is ripe but not yet ruptured; using iron to cauterize at this stage is particularly effective. When the fire of the cauterization is just beginning, it can indeed be alarming! I have used it frequently; even in practice, I still feel a tremor, let alone those who have never experienced it before!&quot; </p>
<p>After cauterization, the pus should flow freely, and there should be no taboos, which is referred to as a ripe sore. When a sore is protruding, the needle&#39;s hole should be directed downward; however, it is essential for the practitioner to be experienced with cauterization, to understand the depths, know the acupuncture points, and distinguish between what is mature and immature. If done improperly, only fresh blood will be released; if done at the right time, yellow pus and necrotic tissue will emerge. It is incorrect to use a sharp needle for cauterization; a fine needle tip is prone to closing up, while instead, a flat and rounded tip is ideal. It is crucial that the hole is permeable, or else the ulcer&#39;s mouth may close again. One should take a root of the Achyranthes, matching the size of the ulcer mouth, slightly peel the coarse skin off, insert it into the ulcer, leaving about half an inch outside, and then apply a paste made of a handful of tender mandarin leaves and Chinese violet, ground together.<a id="trans-550p" href="#orig-550p" class="marker">[550p]</a><br>Niu Xi can cause the evil blood to flow continuously, while the two medicines warm and cool to relieve pain. They should be changed as they dry, which is the full benefit of the ten. The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; states: According to Li Zhai, the method of moxibustion must ensure that the painful area is treated until it no longer hurts; if it is treated until it hurts more, then the poison will disperse with the fire. Otherwise, it would not only be of no benefit but could also be harmful. My humble opinion is that abscesses and sores arise from stagnation of blood and qi, caused by accumulation that fails to move. Generally, large accumulations and stagnations are the hardest to resolve. To disperse them, one cannot quickly achieve results without the power of fire; hence, moxibustion is particularly advisable. There is also the method of the Daoist Sun, known as the Immortal&#39;s moxibustion technique, which is especially refined and clever. If the poison is slightly subdued and deeply entrenched, affecting the qi&#39;s flow, moxibustion is effective; however, if the poison is fierce and urgent, posing a grave danger, then one should use the moxibustion method, which surpasses that of moxibustion alone. </p>
<p>In ancient times, there was the use of sharp stones, and &quot;The Inner Canon&quot; mentions the distinction of nine needles. Although their methods differ, the intention to eradicate disease is the same. In the case of sores and ulcers, the use of needles is paramount. When using them, although one may determine the depth of the ulcer’s opening, one must still adjust based on the thickness of the flesh: if the skin is thin and the needle is deep, it can injure the healthy flesh and worsen the ulcer; if the flesh is thick and the needle is shallow, the pus and poison will not be expelled, which will increase the pain. It&#39;s crucial to be careful when using needles! As for bone abscesses, where qi and poison accumulate, and in cases of long-standing sores that do not drain and are painless internally, it is advisable to use burning needles to open them.<a id="trans-551p" href="#orig-551p" class="marker">[551p]</a><br>If treating throat ailments, one should use a three-edged needle; if there are red and swollen tumors or boils causing pain like burning, it is advisable to use a stone to draw blood in order to release the poison, leading to a reduction in severe cases and complete resolution in mild cases. When Hong&#39;s family had abdominal boils with swelling and pressure, using a needle to drain the pus resulted in recovery. In another case, a person suffered from a cyst with pus buildup and difficulty with urination, nearly facing death; immediate needling released a large amount of pus, restoring the flow of energy and resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>Generally, the method of using needles involves approaching and drawing back, aligning and obtaining results, so that what should be treated is done before it has fully developed. Nowadays, some patients, fearing needles, refuse treatment, and doctors, conforming to the patients&#39; wishes, avoid needling, leading to the formation of pus without rupture, or if rupture occurs, serious damage has already been done. Ultimately, many meet untimely ends, which is indeed lamentable! </p>
<p>The classics say: In warm and bright weather, human blood becomes abundant, and the defensive qi rises, thus blood is easily drawn, and energy flows freely; in cold and dark conditions, human blood becomes thick and stagnant while the defensive qi sinks, which is why blood vessels should be adjusted according to the season. Thus, whenever encountering cold weather or icy conditions, if one intends to use acupuncture, one should first warm themselves with clothing, or heat mugwort leaves, or use heated salt or clothing to pre-warm the area, ensuring the blood vessels are warm and gentle before needling. This way, blood can flow and energy can move, and the ailment will resolve immediately. However, if blood is cold and vessels are stagnant, hastily using needles will not release the邪毒 and may only harm healthy flesh, worsening the condition instead.<a id="trans-552p" href="#orig-552p" class="marker">[552p]</a><br><strong>Guide to Healing</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: For the guidance method of treating various toxic sores and swellings, cross the hands and embrace the neck; use the left shoulder to rise and the right shoulder to descend, focusing intent to harmonize the flow of qi and blood. With calm breathing, let sweat cover the body, thus allowing the toxins to dissolve naturally. </p>
<p>When practicing the exercises, the poisons and sores may affect the skin, and the toxic conditions arise from the internal organs. If the issue is at the front of the body, direct the energy inward; if it is at the back, push outward. For sores and boils, one can easily manipulate the meridians with the hands to disperse swollen toxins, ensuring that energy flows freely, expelling them through the large intestine while focusing on the afflicted area.</p>
<p>At the initial onset of toxins, begin with small circles around the affected area, gradually expanding to larger circles, and cleanse the area with water. If the toxins are firm and refuse to disperse, then apply heat from within to force them out. Once pus is discharged, rotate in large circles outward to small ones, again using water to close the area.<a id="trans-553p" href="#orig-553p" class="marker">[553p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Li Gao&quot; states: Yuan Haowen drank excessively, his pulse was deep and rapid. In September, small sores appeared on his neck and the back of his head, which were neither painful nor itchy, resembling whitehead sores. Four days later, he experienced numbness in the head and neck, with swelling spreading outward, and heat toxins flared up; after two more days, the pain intensified, and he could not sleep at night. The physician administered Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction and later invited me for a diagnosis. I noted that due to the transformation from the rich diet, Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction was inappropriate to use at this point; moreover, the sore had persisted for eight days, and fire therapy should come first, followed by medication. A large moxa stick about the size of two cherries was used to treat the area with strong vigor, and he began to feel pain. Next, I prescribed a remedy specific to the Taiyang Bladder meridian; the condition was reversed and needed to be treated accordingly; the pulse was tight and rapid, but strong. We had to address the underlying cause first, being mindful not to damage the harmony of heaven throughout the seasons. It was crucial to speak in terms of seasonality; hence treatment should focus on dispersing, softening, and not allowing for any cold pathogens while avoiding salty foods. Ultimately, I prescribed Huanglian Xiaodu Decoction, and he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: One man over fifty had a dark complexion, with red swelling on his back, near the shoulder blades, extremely painful. His pulse was rapid, strong, and tight; he also experienced vomiting after eating. In the dead of winter, I prescribed a modified Ma Huang Gui Zhi Decoction with added yellow alkaloid wine, Sheng Fuzhu, (wild) Tuozi, licorice segments, Qianghuo, Qingpi, ginseng, Huangqi, Banxia, and fresh ginger in six doses to reduce the condition. Could this be interpreted as an inner constraint?<a id="trans-554p" href="#orig-554p" class="marker">[554p]</a><br>I once treated a woman nearly seventy years old, who was naturally quick-tempered and fond of wine. She developed a sore on her head. On the fifteenth day, her pulse was tight and urgent, yet thin. I urgently used large yellow wine to stew finely chopped herbs, mixing them with wine and frying them into a powder. I also mixed this powder with wine and combined ginseng with ginger for further decoction, weighing a measure of one qian. After two more doses, she was able to sleep, and sweat appeared on her upper body. After sleeping, her illness was resolved; this too reflects the intention of internal support.</p>
<p>Brother Li from Dongyang, over thirty years old, was thin and had thick skin. He had suffered continuous worries and labored excessively, which led to a sudden red swelling on the outer side of his left leg, as big as a millet grain. One doctor, noting that his large intestine was hard, prescribed two doses of Chengqi Decoction, but it was ineffective. Another doctor recommended a formula with large yellow, vermilion, powdered herbs, and Qilin root, which they combined into two or three doses. Half a month later, he called me to see him, saying: &quot;The issue is resolved!&quot;</p>
<p>Another brother Li, over forty years old, had a slightly pale complexion and looked very fatigued. Suddenly, a red swelling appeared under his ribs, resembling a peach. Someone advised him to take tonics, but others laughed and dismissed it. Thus, he was given a mixture of diuretic and Xuanxuan Powder. After ten days or so, he called me to see him, and I replied: &quot;Not only is it inappropriate to give tonics, but it also causes excess discharge and alleviation on its own. Both qi and blood are exhausted, making recovery difficult!&quot; Eventually, this was indeed the case.<a id="trans-555p" href="#orig-555p" class="marker">[555p]</a><br>A man nearing sixty had a growth on the outer side of his left hip, about two inches in diameter, which was not very painful. He called me for treatment, and upon examining his pulse, I found it weak and slow. I said, &quot;This is due to sadness and worry. When the qi rises and disperses, you must urgently take five or six pounds of ginseng paste.&quot; The patient consulted another surgeon who treated him with a mixture of ten fragrant herbs, applying it five or six times, but the sore worsened. I warned, &quot;This is a significant deficiency; do not underestimate it!&quot; The patient did not believe me, and the other surgeon continued with the same mixture, applying it five or six more times, leading to the sore collapsing and oozing clear fluid, resulting in death. This serves as a warning for those whose abscesses arise from deficiency.</p>
<p>An elderly man aged seventy suffered from an abscess on his back more than a foot in diameter. He had already been treated with various mixtures of spices and ten fragrant herbs dozens of times, with foul blood and pus causing him to vomit and be unable to eat for over ten days. The patient self-medicated with internal medicines, causing discomfort in his abdomen. He also had a history of gonorrhea for thirty years, and now his main suffering was from the pain of this condition and inability to sleep due to vomiting. I urgently prepared a decoction of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, mixing it with cow knee soup and bamboo juice for him to drink. After three days and a total of one and a half pounds of medicine, his pain ceased, and he began to feel hungry. After seven days and a total of four pounds of medicine, pus began to seep out, allowing him to sleep peacefully, and within ten days he was stable.<a id="trans-556p" href="#orig-556p" class="marker">[556p]</a><br>A man over sixty years old, fond of wine and meat, had a back sore that oozed pus, experienced vomiting and fever, likely due to internal excess. The doctor, addressing the vomiting, added cloves to the Jiahe powder to warm the stomach and move qi. It was July, very hot, and his pulse was strong and rapid; I noted that this pulse indicated an ulcer, which is particularly worrisome. However, he was robust, so I just gave him ginseng paste mixed with bamboo juice, using a total of fifteen pounds of medicine and over a hundred stalks of bamboo. I remarked: this condition is fortunately stable; if he doesn&#39;t indulge in flavors, he must still take more. He continued to enjoy rich flavors as usual; after drinking in the summer, he sat by the water tub, and a year later a soft lump like a cake appeared near his left side. Two years later, the lump turned into an ulcer. Seeing pus and blood oozing and noting the strong and rapid pulse, along with his vomiting and reduced appetite, I again gave him ginseng paste mixed with bamboo juice, again using over a hundred stalks of bamboo, and he stabilized. Now at eighty, he is as strong as before. This illness was treated successfully twice with ginseng and bamboo juice, specifically because in old age the blood and qi are weak. Had he received the internal formula Jiexuan powder, I fear he might not have achieved such safety.<a id="trans-557p" href="#orig-557p" class="marker">[557p]</a><br>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure Mirror&quot; states: In the summer of the Ding-si year, I returned from military service and stayed at the border of Cao Prefecture. While on official business in the prefecture, Zhao Tongzhi informed me that my maternal uncle, Niu Jingli, was suffering from a severe illness. His head was red and swollen, and his ears were particularly affected, with pain that was unbearable. He experienced fever and chills, his jaw was tight, and he had thick, sticky mucus. He found it difficult to eat and could not rest comfortably. A doctor had performed acupuncture on the swollen area with over four or five hundred needles, but the redness and swelling did not subside, and his pain worsened. Unsure of the cause, I was asked to take a look.</p>
<p>I went to examine him and found his pulse to be floating and tense, but when pressed, it was surging and weak. This indicated that cold was enveloping the skin, blocking the meridians, preventing heat from rising, resulting in the swelling and redness. The ancient texts say: &quot;When the heavens are cold, the earth freezes and water turns to ice; when human qi is trapped within the body, the skin tightens and the pores close, sweat cannot escape, and blood and qi become strong, leading to rigid flesh.&quot; At such times, those skilled in controlling water cannot breach the ice, those adept at drilling the earth cannot penetrate the frost, and even those skilled in using needles cannot achieve the four extremities. They must wait for the warmth of spring to thaw the ice and dissolve the frost, allowing for the flow of water and the ability to penetrate the earth, just as human pulse conditions are likewise.<a id="trans-558p" href="#orig-558p" class="marker">[558p]</a><br>It is also said: In the winter month, when there is closure and concealment, it is advisable to use more medicinal substances and fewer needles and stones. One should use bitter and warm medicines; warming the muscles and dispersing the cold is necessary. The so-called cold causes the pores to constrict, which can be released with bitterness and dispersed with spiciness. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the Tongli Wengjing Decoction. </p>
<p>Ephedra is bitter and warm, and it is the principal ingredient because it brings forth. Siler is spicy and warm, serving to disperse. Cimicifuga is bitter and stringy, while Kudzu is sweet and mild, resolving the muscles and inducing sweating, specifically treating the evil in the Yangming channel, thus serving as a minister. </p>
<p>When blood flows but does not circulate, it causes pain; for this, Bai Zhi, which is spicy and warm, is used; and Dang Gui, being spicy and sweet, harmonizes blood and disperses stagnation. If damp-heat causes swelling, Atractylodes is spicy and sweet, light and buoyant, strong and capable of dispelling damp-heat from the skin. </p>
<p>Ginseng and Licorice are sweet and warm, while White Peony is slightly sour and cool, balancing and augmenting Qi to support its interior. Therefore, they serve as assistants. Administer this formula while having the patient wear thin clothing over their head and a thick cover over their body, resting in a warm place to ensure the menstrual blood warms, allowing the pores to open, dispersing the cold, and promoting Yang Qi circulation. After a large sweat, the swelling will reduce by eighty to ninety percent. </p>
<p>If you take away Ephedra and Siler, and add Forsythia and Mouse Glue, all swelling and pain will be alleviated. The classic states that if sweating occurs, the sores will heal—truly wise words! However, some people follow Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s teachings, suggesting that those with sores should not sweat even if they experience body pain. What is the reason for this? I suggest that this is due to the Ying Qi not following, countering the flesh and leading to sore swellings and body pains, which are not from external influences. </p>
<p>If there is external invasion of cold evil causing pain, it is advised against inducing sweat; to sweat in such a case can lead to spasms.<a id="trans-559p" href="#orig-559p" class="marker">[559p]</a><br>In the winter of the year of Wuwu, I was stationed in Wucheng County with the army. There was a merchant’s father, over sixty years old, who developed a sore on his back a few days after the winter solstice. After five or seven days, the swelling reached about seven inches and was unbearable. The sore doctor said that pus had formed and could be opened, but he was afraid and did not comply. Three days later, the doctor warned that if it was not opened, it might lead to changes in the condition. Therefore, he used a burning needle to open it, the pus flowed out and the pain lessened. However, due to the delay in opening it, two days later the condition indeed changed; he felt heavy as if carrying a stone, hot as if burning, and the pain was doubled compared to before. His six pulses were deep and rapid, and pressing them felt forceful; this was a transformation due to the accumulation of heat from rich food. The evil qi was extremely hot, thus it was appropriate to treat it with cold medicine. However, the weather was severe and there were warnings against using cold, so I recalled the Inner Canon saying that one can counteract the faux conditions even if it goes against the time if it corresponds with the symptoms. I discussed with the sore doctor and urgently concocted a cooling drink with added bitter herb, weighing one tael and five qian, to be taken in one dose. It induced a bowel movement and the pain decreased by seven parts. The next day, I administered the same medicine again, and all the symptoms were eliminated. After more than a month, he recovered fully.<a id="trans-560p" href="#orig-560p" class="marker">[560p]</a><br>Chen Lu&#39;s mother was over seventy years old and developed a sore at the back of her head after the winter solstice, which was as large as a bowl. He ordered a sore doctor to examine it, waiting for the wound to mature before using a needle to drain the pus. Due to anger, he struck a maid, causing the sore to become indented about the size of a leeks leaf. Her complexion turned bluish-yellow and lacked luster, her limbs felt cold, she broke out in a cold sweat, and sometimes vomited. Her pulse was extremely weak, thin, and slow. This was due to her old age, the harsh winter, and the suffering from the illness, with a poor appetite. The dampness and pus had been expelled, leaving only a frail appearance. The added anger further harmed her spirit, leading to this cold transformation. </p>
<p>The illness corresponded with the season, and after discussing with the sore doctor, a swift remedy of five-spice soup was prepared, with five qian each of clove and aconite added. When the dose was completed, the sore flared up again, and she was treated according to the symptoms until she recovered. The “Inner Canon” states: “In treating illness, one must examine its underlying conditions,” meaning one should assess the appropriateness of the current situation. All pains, itching, and sores belong to heart fire, indicating their commonality. If a sore is severe and the appearance skinny, with elevated evil causing pain below, starting with heat and ending in cold, this is abnormal and should certainly be examined according to the current situation and treated accordingly. Hence, it is said that the principles are constant, the methods are applied, and the physician&#39;s intentions are vital; treating according to what is appropriate can yield complete success.<a id="trans-561p" href="#orig-561p" class="marker">[561p]</a><br>On the 28th day of the fifth month in the Renwu year of the Zhiyuan era, Wang Bolu, aged over fifty-seven, had a swelling in his right arm, extending from the shoulder to the fingertips, with the skin turning cool in color. His pulse was deep, thin, and weak, indicating a cold condition. I consulted with the ulcer doctor Sun Yanhe, who said: &quot;This is a bone abscess; the treatment has been delayed. We should use a burning needle to stimulate it, allowing the pus to discharge in a clear, thin form.&quot; </p>
<p>The next day, he was reopened at the elbow, and he experienced persistent hiccups. Yanhe administered a formula of clove and persimmon calyx, which provided some relief. The following day, hiccups worsened, accompanied by frequent diarrhea, cold pain, and fullness in the abdomen, along with reduced appetite and intermittent bouts of dizziness. I performed moxibustion on the blackened area beneath his left breast seven times. Additionally, I prescribed the Tuo Li Wen Zhong Decoction, containing dried ginger, aconite, wood fragrance, sandalwood, fennel, and qianghuo, to be chewed finely (about one and a half liang) for him to take.<a id="trans-562p" href="#orig-562p" class="marker">[562p]</a><br>It may be said: All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers are attributed to heart fire. During the height of summer, is it appropriate to use dried ginger and aconite? I respond that it is only natural; it cannot be otherwise. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Fine pulse and cold skin, diarrhea occurring before and after, inability to take in food, this is called the five vacuities. Moreover, the occurrence of hiccup and reversal stems from vacuity and cold in the stomach. Thus, all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers relate to heart fire, which is the fixed principle. This diagnosis shows a contradiction between internal and external conditions; treatment must be based on the evidence rather than the time, and without urgent treatment with major hot herbs, recovery cannot be achieved. Therefore, I administered the herbs, and all symptoms ceased; food intake doubled, the sores warmed, and the pus had the proper color. Yan He again used Five Spice Decoction several times, and after more than a month, he recovered. Ah! Adhering to the regular is the perspective of the many; understanding change is the concern of the wise.

Generally, for abscesses with mature pus, if one does not perform needle therapy, the pus can erode internally—mild cases are difficult to treat, severe cases are incurable. In elderly or weak individuals, or in remote areas, this becomes critical. If there is any pus, it is advisable to perform needling urgently and supplement with Tori to prevent any complications.</p>
<p>A man suffered from pain due to toxins and took cold medicine. Although the pain subsided, his appetite decreased, and the abscess did not rupture. With Six Gentlemen Decoction, his appetite improved. Then, he took Tori medicine, which led to its rupture and healing. Generally, the symptoms of sores and boils—whether due to cold, heat, deficiency, or excess—can all cause pain. For heat-related pain, cold medications are used to suppress it; for cold-related pain, warm medications are used to disperse it; if pain is caused by wind, the wind is removed; if due to dampness, moisture is expelled; if dryness causes pain, then it is moistened; if blockage causes pain, it is opened; if deficiency causes pain, it is strengthened; if excess causes pain, it is purged; if pus is stagnant and closed, it is opened; if there is necrotic tissue causing erosion, it is removed; if yin and yang are unbalanced, they are adjusted; if meridians are obstructed, they are unblocked. One must be careful not to use cold medications universally. Furthermore, blood vessels prefer warmth and dislike cold; if cold air enters the interior, the blood will coagulate and cause difficult-to-heal conditions.<a id="trans-566p" href="#orig-566p" class="marker">[566p]</a><br>A man of frail constitution had swelling in the elbow and wished for it to be resolved internally. However, taking cooling herbs resulted in diarrhea and reduced appetite. He was treated with Er Shen Wan and Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding nutmeg to stop the diarrhea and improve his appetite, as well as with medicines for relieving internal pressure, which also resolved the swelling. Dan Xi stated that abscesses arise from a buildup of toxins in the organs, and it&#39;s essential to first support the stomach to strengthen its vital energy, establishing a firm foundation. Then, use blood-moving herbs along with seasonal treatment to allow the toxins to emerge and be expelled. This is the essence of internal expulsion. He also mentioned that when there are swellings and sores, it is best to primarily use herbs that relieve internal pressure and disperse exterior conditions. If one desires to use Da Huang (rhubarb), it should be done cautiously to avoid recklessness. When both the internal and external sores are weak, nurturing and supplementing is the priority. Should one choose to use fragrant dispersing herbs, it may lead to excessive weakness. Generally, conditions of abscesses and swellings should not be solely treated with fire-inducing methods. The classics say that when the nourishing energy does not flow properly, it stagnates in the flesh, leading to abscesses. It also states that when the form is injured, swelling results in pain. Six excesses and seven emotions can lead to such conditions, especially considering the variances in constitution, age, and weakness, it would be inappropriate to uniformly apply cold and cool medicines. If the toxins have just begun to accumulate, but there is no pus yet and the condition is not severe, resolution is possible. It is crucial to understand the underlying cause of the illness and differentiate between weakness and strength. Should one apply cold and cooling medicines indiscriminately, it will surely lead to problems. If pus is about to form and the evil is vigorous while the energy is strong, using detoxifying agents first to kill the toxins will ensure that even if pus does form, it will not be excessively painful, and ulceration will not be severe. If one applies remedies for relieving internal pressure, it must be to enhance the condition. When pus is on the verge of forming or not yet ruptured, then one can use methods to relieve internal pressure. When pus is sufficiently formed and the condition is severe, one should use needles, and once the pus is released, all symptoms will retreat.<a id="trans-567p" href="#orig-567p" class="marker">[567p]</a><br>A man had a festering sore that had not ruptured, experienced slight pain and loss of appetite, and felt fatigued with a fever. I treated him with acupuncture, and pus began to flow out, but the heat became more intense, indicating a deficiency. I quickly administered two doses of Ginseng and Astragalus Decoction, but the heat increased further, suggesting that the medicinal power had not yet taken effect. After another two doses, the condition was indeed responding; I then prescribed several doses of Angelica Blood-Nourishing Decoction, and he recovered. Dongyuan states: If there is a fever with a dislike of heat, relentless thirst, irritability with a hot body, and a pulse that is large but weak upon pressure, or if there is pain in the eyes and dryness in the nose, it is not a case for Baihu Decoction; this is a case of blood deficiency causing agitation, and the Angelica Blood-Nourishing Decoction should be used for treatment.</p>
<p>A woman, having a weak spleen qi, suffered from a toxin that had not yet formed pus, with concurrent chills and fever and vomiting. After two doses of Jinzhengqi Powder, her symptoms ceased; she then took six doses of Tuoli Powder, and the sore ruptured; further, I administered spleen-strengthening medicine to help heal.<a id="trans-568p" href="#orig-568p" class="marker">[568p]</a><br>A man suffered from a carbuncle; the pus had formed but had not yet ruptured. After taking a restorative remedy, it burst, and with further treatment to strengthen the spleen, he recovered: his vital energy and blood became robust, and the pus naturally flowed out. Indeed!</p>
<p>A man had a carbuncle that ruptured but the stagnant blood did not decay. He was given ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes to vigorously replenish his qi and blood and was further treated with moxibustion on the affected area, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young boy had a carbuncle under his armpit, with the pus not clearing. His pulse was large and he was weak, disinterested in food, had difficulty sleeping, experienced spontaneous sweating, and had a dry mouth. He was treated internally with astragalus soup and moxibustion with fermented soybeans, resulting in recovery after two months. Generally, if a wound&#39;s pus ruptures and cleans, or if the wound does not close, or if there is a swelling that is not red and the flesh feels cold, or spontaneous sweating with a pale complexion, it indicates a deficiency in both qi and blood, thus supplementation is essential.</p>
<p>A man had a toxic swelling in his waist; the pus was ripe but had not ruptured. After needling, the pus leaked profusely but then caused him increased anxiety. He was treated with Shengyu Decoction for four doses, which brought him some peace; he then took Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction with added Ophiopogon and Schisandra for two months before recovery. This man later suffered from dampness, which became a chronic ailment. If pus and blood from a wound reduce significantly, even if the wound closes, it is still crucial to provide nourishing support to restore qi and blood. Otherwise, he may develop other conditions that are difficult to treat. Be cautious!</p>
<p>A woman had a carbuncle on her arm; the wound was purple and sunken with clear pus that would not contain itself. She thought the toxicity was not yet exhausted and wanted to take purgative detoxifying medicine. I indicated that in cases of ulcers, if the swelling is hard and raised with thick pus, it shows excess; if the swelling is soft and slow to resolve with thin pus, it indicates deficiency. Therefore, I applied aconite paste for moxibustion and prescribed one hundred doses of a fortifying tonic, ultimately leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-569p" href="#orig-569p" class="marker">[569p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a bone abscess, which did not heal for a long time, resulting in a thin and shortened soft leg, and her pulse was slow. I treated her with the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction, adding Achyranthes and Eucommia, and moxibustion with aconite cake. After more than two months, she recovered. Generally, after pus has ruptured, if the pulse is weak and slow, it is easier to heal, as there is still stomach qi; if the pulse is thin and submerged, intermittently stopping, it indicates internal deficiency and a desire for change. If there is still pain and discomfort, it is difficult to heal when the pulse is coarse, slippery, and scattered, as it indicates a deficiency of righteous qi and excess of pathogenic qi.</p>
<p>A man was attacked by wind at a sore, with his jaw tightly closed and his back arched. I prescribed one dose of the Jade True Powder, and he recovered, then used a remedy to consolidate the sore.</p>
<p>Another man had an abscess about to resolve, with itching all over his body and a floating pulse. I gave him two doses of the Wind-Dispersing Powder, and the itching stopped; then I used a remedy to consolidate, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man had a boil under his shoulder for several days, slightly swollen and painful, with many small lumps like millet, the color unchanged, and not yet maturing. This indicated deficiency of qi and blood, confirmed by his pulse. First, I prescribed two doses of the Immortal Formula to suppress the major condition. Then I used a remedy to stimulate the boil&#39;s maturation. Although it ruptured, it only oozed blood and water, indicating that qi and blood were still deficient and unable to produce pus. He wanted to take the Taiyi Pill, but I said this medicine merely attacks toxins and cannot consolidate. He did not believe me, and after he failed to eat for four meals, the sore turned black and concave, with relentless nausea, indicating extreme deficiency of stomach qi, leading to no treatment. I forcefully prescribed warming and strengthening the spleen medicine, but it did not respond, and he died.<a id="trans-570p" href="#orig-570p" class="marker">[570p]</a><br>A man had a swelling by his side due to an abscess that did not rupture. He was given a strong tonic, and once it ruptured, he was cured; however, he later suffered from weakness and died.</p>
<p>Another man had an abscess in his lower back that appeared but did not rupture. His energy and blood could only initiate the symptoms but could not develop into pus. After several doses of a strong tonic, it ruptured, and after additional doses, the pus that came out was still clear. He then took a mixture of ginseng, astragalus, and other tonics; when the pus was scant and thick, after a few more doses, the pus gradually became thicker, and muscle tissue began to regrow. </p>
<p>For serious abscesses, energy and blood are crucial. If the condition does not progress or if it ruptures but remains unhealed, or if it does not close up and the pus is scant or clear, it indicates a deficiency of energy and blood, necessitating strong tonics, with a strict avoidance of aggressive treatments. In cases where there is an excess of pus, this also stems from a deficiency of energy and blood that cannot be restrained. If after rupture there is fever and thirst, with a strong pulse and increasing pus, this signifies a deficiency of true energy alongside an excess of pathogenic qi, and treatment becomes difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, people with sufficient energy and blood tend to have swollen, high, red abscesses that are prone to easy rupture and thick pus, making it easier for recovery. Conversely, weak individuals often do not develop or rupture abscesses easily, and their conditions are hard to treat. If one does not carefully assess and recklessly administer aggressive treatments, they will inevitably encounter disaster due to deficiency.</p>
<p>After any illness, especially in cases of scrofula and suppurative diseases, it is crucial to focus on nourishment. Otherwise, if other illnesses arise, treatment will be extremely challenging. Be cautious!<a id="trans-571p" href="#orig-571p" class="marker">[571p]</a><br>A man suffered from a toxic condition in his shoulder, exhibiting swelling, hardness, and pain, with worsening symptoms recurring. A treatment was prepared with three qian of powdered alum to form pills, which were taken with a broth made from seven stalks of scallions. The swelling and pain completely subsided; after taking it again, all symptoms also disappeared. Furthermore, two doses of a miraculous life-saving drink were used, which expelled fluids and resolved the issue. This secret formula is named &quot;Thousand Gold Detox Soup,&quot; prepared with powdered alum and scallion broth. Due to the difficulty in ingesting the powder, it was shaped into pills.</p>
<p>Another man had an abscess in his chest, accompanied by burning pain, agitation, fever, and thirst, with a rapid and strong pulse. During the winter season, I diagnosed this as an internal buildup of heat and toxins, needing treatment based on the symptoms at this time. I recommended using Huanglian Decoction for internal clearance. However, since it was mid-winter, he mixed in some toxic-damp dispelling medications, which caused the condition to worsen, and he continued to seek treatment. After administering the initial decoction twice and then stopping for two times, all symptoms subsided. By adding honeysuckle flower powder with Lianqiao and Sanjizhi in four doses, fluids were expelled and the problem resolved. Generally, one must identify the main symptoms and treat them accordingly. If the main issue is treated, the secondary symptoms will diminish. The choice of treatment should not be fixed to a particular time, as being tied to conventions can lead to serious illness. Moreover, the improper use of aggressive medications can harm the meridians. Therefore, Danxi taught that if a sore erupts in one meridian, we should address the root in that meridian without disturbing the others. Luo Qianfu stated, &quot;Following conventions is the common perspective; understanding change is the wisdom of the discerning.&quot; Many fail due to ignorance of change while being overly concerned with details.<a id="trans-572p" href="#orig-572p" class="marker">[572p]</a><br>At the age of over forty, an outbreak of anger caused persistent internal pain. After several days, an exterior lump formed, about three inches in size, swollen but not red, and slightly painful when pressed. I believed that the anger had harmed the liver, leading to blood injuries and stagnation of qi, resulting in these issues. I prescribed a formula of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction along with Si Wu Decoction, increasing the amounts of Chuanxiong, Angelica, Astragalus, Fritillaria, and Cinnamon to treat it. Others quoted Danxi, saying that the swelling and sores were due to internal and external stagnation, suggesting an approach that focused on resolving the excess. They further stated that before a sore has broken, if toxins attack the internal organs, no heat-inducing herbs should be used. Moreover, in this case, it was due to qi and blood stagnation, leading to using a qi-moving drink which seemed to worsen the deficiency, thus I began to trust it and sought further help. Upon examination, it was clear that signs of deficiency had collected, and the diagnosis revealed greater deficiency of stomach qi.<a id="trans-573p" href="#orig-573p" class="marker">[573p]</a><br>He wanted to take the medicine I had prescribed earlier, but I advised that those in critical condition should be treated first. Therefore, I used the Four Gentlemen Decoction with wine, stir-fried with white peony and processed ginger in four doses to gradually ease his condition. I added more angelica, then four more doses, and his stomach qi began to recover. I then removed the processed ginger and added astragalus, chuanxiong, angelica, and cinnamon in several doses; the abscess was less red and had slight pain. After more than twenty doses, pus formed, and I circumcised it, followed by giving him the Complete Nutritional Decoction. Delighted with his careful recovery, it took just over two more months for him to heal completely.</p>
<p>In cases where qi and blood are stagnant, it often results from weakened nutritive and defensive qi, which fail to circulate and disperse. How can one use qi-stagnating drinks to strengthen its deficiency? Moreover, blood and qi in each meridian vary greatly: the pericardium, bladder, and small intestine meridians have more blood and less qi, while the triple burner, gallbladder, kidneys, heart, spleen, and lungs have more qi and less blood. The previous symptoms particularly belonged to the gallbladder meridian, which is deficient in blood. Those over forty experience a daily decline in yin blood, and both pulse and symptoms indicate deficiency; the swelling and sores both signify obstruction. Thus, it is advisable to focus on relieving the exterior and dispersing the congestion, while reinforcing qi and blood with additional dispersing agents, rather than a direct attack.</p>
<p>If the swelling and pain are severe, with irritability and a forceful pulse, warming and stimulating medications should not only be avoided for swollen sores but also should not be used for ulcers. In all cases, the treatment must distinguish between the meridians, the proximity or distance from the earth, the age of the patient, their innate qi deficiency or excess, as well as the emotional influences and seasonal appropriateness of the treatment. It is common to misuse qi-stagnating and ten-points-expelling medications to treat cases of swelling, thus leading to many failures.<a id="trans-574p" href="#orig-574p" class="marker">[574p]</a><br>A woman, after a sore ruptured, vomited about three bowls of fresh blood. I used a decoction of Radix Codonopsis (Dong Cong Xia Cao) and the bleeding stopped; then I administered Si Jun Zi Tang, Shou Di Huang, Chuan Xiong, and Dang Gui, resulting in the healing of the sore. This illustrates the principle that when blood is lost, one must replenish the qi; yin grows and yang is generated. If one were to use cold blood-cooling agents to reduce heat and subdue yin, it would harm the spleen and qi, not only failing to return the blood to its source but also undoubtedly leading to death.</p>
<p>A military man suffered from a brain abscess, experiencing internal rupture and extreme thirst, with his face and head swollen like a bowl, and his chest and back bright red as if painted with cinnabar, alongside irritability and constipation. This indicates both exterior and interior are full. If not addressed with bitter cold remedies to disperse internally and drain externally, he would not be saved. Thus, I performed acupuncture around the neck to drain the pus, and administered a cooling drink with five qian of Da Huang, followed by Xiao Feng San, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-575p" href="#orig-575p" class="marker">[575p]</a><br>A man suffered from sores that festered and caused him intense thirst and restlessness. He was calmed with two doses of Shengyu Decoction; for his thirst, he was treated with four doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and rehmannia. After receiving over twenty doses of Eight Treasures Decoction, he was cured. Generally, after such sores, if there are symptoms like this, it indicates insufficient qi and blood, necessitating the use of ginseng and astragalus to tonify qi, and angelica and rehmannia to nourish blood. If bitter and cold remedies are used, it will surely lead to adverse effects.</p>
<p>Another man experienced thirst due to toxicity, with a rapid pulse in the right guan position. He was treated with Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction and improved slightly; he was later cured with a modified Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with added Huangqin.</p>

<p>A man experienced pain after a rupture, with a floating and tight pulse. He took four doses of the Inner Nourishing Astragalus Decoction which stopped the pain, and after more than twenty doses, he was healed.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a toxic condition in the neck, leading to a rupture and pain. He was treated with ginseng, astragalus, rehmannia, ligusticum, and angelica, which alleviated his issues. He then received over thirty doses of the Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus and platycodon, resulting in his recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a boil, which ruptured and caused pain; his pulse was soft and weak. I suggested he was suffering from deficiency in qi and blood and needed nourishment. He doubted this and took aggressive medicinal treatments instead, which led to chills and fever, causing him to believe in my diagnosis. He then took a potent tonic and recovered. Generally, at the early stage of sores, swelling appears first, with qi and blood stagnating, resulting in pus formation, hence the pain. Once the pus is discharged, swelling decreases and muscles relax, pain will gradually lessen. If pain returns, it indicates deficiency. Danxi noted: if pain is experienced again after pus has emerged, it signifies deficiency, necessitating nourishment. There are also cases touched by foul qi that require harmonization; and those constrained by wind and cold that need warming dispersals. The Qi clan stated that in the case of sores and boils, there are various factors involving the organs and meridians, qi and blood, the internal and external, and true evil vs. deficiency. These must be discerned. For example, if the swelling is hard and accompanied by thick pus, it indicates a solid condition; if the swelling below is soft and slow with thin pus, it indicates a deficient state.<a id="trans-577p" href="#orig-577p" class="marker">[577p]</a><br>Diarrhea and abdominal rumbling, inability to eat or drink, vomiting without interval, cold hands and feet, weak pulse and cold skin, frequent urination or difficulty urinating, smooth and loose bowel movements, absence of voice, and dulled spirit indicate deficiency of the organs; hard stool, frequent urination, normal appetite, abdominal fullness and distension, chest tightness and discomfort, body pain, bitter mouth and dry throat, irritability and excessive thirst, body heat and strong pulse, and foggy spirit indicate excess in the organs. For sores and boils, if the pus is clear and thin, the sore edges do not come together, the swelling is not red, the flesh is cold, and there is spontaneous sweating and colorlessness, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood; if the swelling is red, with cold and hot pain, hot and vigorous skin, thick and sticky pus, and heaviness in the head and eyes, it indicates excess of qi and blood.<a id="trans-578p" href="#orig-578p" class="marker">[578p]</a><br>Headache and nasal congestion, red eyes and heart palpitations, difficulty in the throat, sores in the mouth and tongue, thirst and drinking cold, talking in sleep and grinding teeth indicate excess in the upper body. If one experiences slippery essence that cannot be contained, spontaneous bowel movements, a heavy feeling in the waist and legs, and restless sleep, it indicates deficiency in the lower body. If one has discomfort in the shoulders and neck, heavy limbs, improper vision, unclear eyesight, lack of taste in food, hoarse voice and pale complexion, and swelling in the limbs, it indicates deficiency in vital energy. If there is severe swelling and pain that is unbearable, persistent without healing, alternating between cold and heat, constipation and diarrhea, painful urination, and disturbed spirit with confusion and restlessness, it indicates the presence of evil qi. Moreover, it is said: when vital energy is depleted, deficiency ensues; when evil qi prevails, excess occurs. Additionally, it is said: all sores that itch are due to deficiency. Furthermore, it is stated: a pulse that is large and rapid indicates excess, while a pulse that is fine and soft indicates deficiency. When deficient, one should tonify and harmonize the qi; when excessive, one should drain and guide the qi out. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if blood is excess, it should be drained; if qi is deficient, it should be gently pulled.<a id="trans-579p" href="#orig-579p" class="marker">[579p]</a><br>A man experienced fever and pain after a suppuration, with a floating and rapid pulse, weak upon pressure, and worsening with exertion. He was treated with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, which alleviated his condition; he then fully recovered with the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. It is noted that when the left hand pulse is weaker than the right and exhibits heat, one should use more blood-tonifying herbs than qi-tonifying herbs; conversely, when the right hand pulse is weaker than the left and exhibits heat, one should use more qi-tonifying herbs than blood-tonifying herbs.</p>
<p>Another man, after suppuration, presented with fever and headache, with a floating and tense pulse, indicating both deficiency and an exterior pathogen. He was treated with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Chuan Xiong and Bai Zhi, which resolved the symptoms; he then recovered with the use of herbs to resolve phlegm.</p>
<p>A woman, following suppuration, exhibited fever and insomnia, with fatigue in her limbs. She was treated with a decoction of Huang Qi and Ren Shen, which provided stability; she then fully recovered after over a month using the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, adding Bei Mu, Yuan Zhi, Mai Men Dong, Suan Zao Ren, and Xiang Fu.<a id="trans-580p" href="#orig-580p" class="marker">[580p]</a><br>A woman with a boil developed a fever after its rupture; taking heat-clearing and detoxifying medicine worsened her condition.

<p>A man had a boil that ruptured, causing fever and slight headache, especially worse in the evening. His pulse was floating and thin; he was treated with Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction, adding Chai Hu and Di Gu Pi, which led to recovery after some time.</p>
<p>Another man experienced chills after a boil; he was treated with Si Jun Zi Decoction, adding cinnamon and doubling the quantity of astragalus major. After four doses, his condition improved; however, pus was still present, so he took Ba Zhen Decoction with cinnamon, gradually reducing it over several doses. His wound remained unhealed, so he was given a cake of aconite and Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, with five fen of processed aconite added in each dose; after several doses, aconite was removed, and he continued taking the medicine for over a month until fully healed.</p>
<p>A man, nearing recovery from a boil, experienced fever in his limbs due to exertion, feeling restless and unable to sleep. He was treated with Sheng Yu Decoction for four doses, which calmed him; then he was given a restorative medicine, leading to recovery. Dan Xi noted that when one&#39;s limbs feel hot and they are sensitive to wind and cold, it indicates a deficiency of yin and an excess of yang.</p>
<p>Another man felt cold after a boil ruptured, with a weak pulse; he was treated with Si Jun Zi Decoction, adding processed ginger, and he improved after four doses. He was then given Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction for over a month, achieving stabilization. Zhongjing stated that a weak pulse signifies a deficiency of blood, leading to cold and insufficient yang qi. For swollen wounds with a weak pulse, nourishment and restorative measures should be used. Indeed!<a id="trans-581p" href="#orig-581p" class="marker">[581p]</a><br>A woman developed a fever after an ulcer; she took cool medicine but instead felt cold, so she stopped after two doses of the Shiquan Dabu Decoction.

<p>A man with a carbuncle drank alcohol, developing pain and fever; he took the Huanglian Jiedu Decoction twice and improved. Later, he took a medicine to reduce internal dampness and detoxify, leading to his recovery. He would often treat pain and constipation with a cooling drink. </p>
<p>Another man suffering from a carbuncle experienced sudden chills while in a cold and damp environment; his pulse was present but faint in his right hand, indicating deficiency of stomach qi which could not withstand cold. He was treated with the Four Gentlemen Decoction, adding roasted ginger and cinnamon, and after two doses he felt better; after four doses more, he stabilized. Danxi remarked that when protective qi is weak and cannot warm the flesh in the exterior, it leads to coldness; there could also be evil in the upper chamber blocking the nourishment and protective qi, preventing elevation or dispersion of wind and causing chills. Dongyuan said: if cold is felt at night but not during the day, this indicates blood is thriving in the yin; if chills occur at night and during the day, it implies an excess of yin with insufficient yang, calling for urgent purging of the yin and strong support of the yang; if one feels calm at night but experiences chills during the day, this indicates yin energy overflowing into the yang.<a id="trans-582p" href="#orig-582p" class="marker">[582p]</a><br>A man suffered from a toxic swelling in his chest, felt nauseous and preferred cold.

<p>Another man developed a sore on the top of his foot and felt thirsty after recovering. He was treated with the previous formula and healed. The modified Bawei Wan is an excellent remedy for yin deficiency and fire activation; in cases like this, why abandon it?<a id="trans-583p" href="#orig-583p" class="marker">[583p]</a><br>A wealthy merchant had a considerable disposition and was persistently thirsty, drinking several bowls of water daily. He developed a boil on his face; though he treated it with disinfectant and healed, his pulse remained rapid, and the thirst did not cease. It was early autumn when I suggested that it was due to heart fire, predicting unavoidable issues arising from the boil and advised him to take the modified Eight Flavor Pill to supplement his kidney water. He did not believe me, and by summer, a boil appeared on the back of his foot. His pulse was rapid, and when pressed, it felt weak and without strength; this indicated a pulse of dry water and excessive fire, leading eventually to black necrosis, resulting in death.</p>
<p>A man of substantial build, lacking descendants, took aconite and other medicines that caused thirst. He developed a boil on the big toe of his left foot, which was purple and painless; his pulse was also rapid and weak, and he died. Generally, if boils occur on the back or brain, showing swelling, pain, and redness, with a pulse indicative of diminished water and excessive fire, it may still be treated; however, if the color is black or purple, indicating extreme fire resembling lack of water, it means the kidney water has been depleted, and vital essence has dried up—there is no possibility of cure.</p>
<p>Another nobleman suffered from an illness with boils and was thirsty without relief, drinking several liters of water daily. I foolishly offered the modified Eight Flavor Pill. Other physicians laughed, saying, &quot;If this medicine can quench thirst, we might as well abandon our practice.&quot; Instead, they used remedies like papaya, perilla, dried plum, ginseng, poria, and various herbs to produce body fluids, but the thirst only intensified. After several doses without effect, they had no choice but to use my suggestion, and after three days, the thirst ceased. Thus, they came to believe in it, and continued its use; not only did the thirst not return, but his blood and qi strengthened, allowing for increased appetite and vitality, even surpassing his youth. It was not merely my opinion; there is indeed a valid source for this treatment.<a id="trans-584p" href="#orig-584p" class="marker">[584p]</a><br>Since my childhood, I have heard my late father say: There was once a scholar who suffered from a debilitating thirst, and all the doctors treated him with thirst-quenching medicines, yet his condition remained unstable for many years. A famous physician then diagnosed him and prescribed the adjusted Eight Flavor Pill, and within half a year, he was cured. This led to an understanding of the source of his illness. </p>
<p>Now, when doctors treat sores, they mistakenly use medicines that generate body fluids to stop the thirst. This is an error! The root of the illness originated from the depletion of kidney water, which no longer provides moisture upward, leading to a fiery heart that burns upward, causing thirst from boiling. Taking the Eight Flavor Pill alleviates the heart fire and replenishes the kidney water, thus quenching the thirst. </p>
<p>Furthermore, analyzing the properties of the medicine, it is said that within the Five Flavors, the north flavor is the most effective. This single ingredient can uniquely nourish kidney water and harmonize heart fire, yielding significant results. Our family has this formula stored away and through personal use, it has proven effective, hence I dare to lay it out in detail, so that those who suffer from thirst may trust its efficacy, focus on taking the medicine to achieve results, and not be misled by incompetent doctors, hopefully broadening the intent of those before us. </p>
<p>Conditions such as arm pain, leg swelling, wind ailments, muscle cramps, shortness of breath, lung issues like cough and asthma, improved digestion, promoting urination, prolonged use leads to lightness in the body, enhanced clarity of hearing and sight, and promotes vitality and fertility.<a id="trans-585p" href="#orig-585p" class="marker">[585p]</a><br>A woman suffered from toxicity, experiencing pain, fever, and thirst, with a rapid pulse that was strong upon palpation.

Dan Xi said: “Ulceration and thirst are due to both qi and blood deficiency, especially with a floating and weak pulse.” I prescribed three qian each of Ren Shen and Huangqi, and two qian each of Gui Zhi, Bai Zhu, and Shu Di. After several doses, his thirst diminished; I then added Huangqi to Ba Zhen Tang for several doses, which helped his pulse stabilize and he recovered.</p>
<p>In treating thirst related to sores or ulcers, I do not concern myself with swelling and suppuration, only with rapid pulse, fever, and thirst, thereby using Zhuye Huangqi Decoction. If the pulse is not rapid and there is no fever, or if the pulse is rapid but weak and the person feels thirsty or dry in the mouth, I use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. If the pulse is rapid but the patient also has constipation, I administer a cooling drink. For a large, strong pulse with weakness on palpation and thirst, I use modified Bawei Wan, which is effective. For treating dry mouth and a yellow tongue, where drinking causes no relief, this pill is particularly marvelous.<a id="trans-586p" href="#orig-586p" class="marker">[586p]</a><br>A man suffered from a boil that had not yet formed pus, experiencing pain and agitation, with a full pulse. I administered two doses of a decoction with Huang Lian, which alleviated all symptoms; then I used Si Wu Decoction with added Qin and Lian for four doses, and the boil subsided.</p>
<p>A man with a rupture experienced constipation, his pulse was floating, and upon palpation, it felt empty. I treated him with Ba Zhen Decoction augmented with Hong Hua, Tao Ren, Chen Pi, and Xing Ren, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A weak man with a rupture faced constipation and an empty pulse. I treated him with Si Wu Decoction plus Hong Hua, Tao Ren, and Huang Qi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man with a rupture exhibited constipation and a floating pulse. I used Si Jun Zi Decoction augmented with Chen Pi, Xing Ren, and Dang Gui, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>An elderly man with a rupture suffered from severe constipation and reddish, scanty urination. Upon diagnosis, his pulse was floating, rapid, and empty. I administered Ba Zhen Decoction with added Huang Bo and Zhi Mu, leading to significant improvement. However, later, his urination became frequent and red, with continued constipation, dry mouth, and blurred vision. I treated him with a modified Ba Wei Pills to nourish the kidneys, resulting in recovery. This case represented a deficiency of Yin blood and excess of Yang fire, hence the usefulness of the previously prescribed medicine. If bitter and cold medicines had been administered, there would certainly have been adverse effects.<a id="trans-587p" href="#orig-587p" class="marker">[587p]</a><br>A man experienced a skin itch after an outbreak, which I attributed to a deficiency in qi and blood that couldn’t nourish the pores. I treated him with tonics. He did not believe and instead took remedies for wind, resulting in no improvement. Generally, when sores first appear with a weak pulse and itchiness, the focus should be on reducing fire and cooling the blood. After the onset, if the pulse remains weak, the focus should be on replenishing blood and qi. Resorting to wind medications can lead to calamity.</p>
<p>A scholar suffered from many bone ulcers in his leg for over a year, expelling some necrotic bone. He felt cold before noon and had fever in the afternoon, with dry mouth and phlegm, frequent urination. I believed this to be due to a deficiency in the three yin of the foot. I administered a formula to tonify middle qi in the morning and the Eight Ingredients Pill with added Astragalus, Angelica, and Schisandra in the evening, giving over thirty doses. I also applied external medications, and he gradually improved; he particularly liked the restorative formulas.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen and hardened palate for over a year before it ulcerated. He experienced internal heat leading to thirst and significant weight loss; the pulses were strong, especially on the left side. I used the same tonifying middle qi formula along with a Six-Flavor Pill, which expelled a piece of necrotic bone. Continuing with the previous medications, all symptoms resolved, and the ulcer closed.</p>
<p>A woman over thirty, previously weak, gradually had swelling on the back of her left hand. After two years, it ulcerated with clear pus, the swelling darkened and extended to her arm. She suffered from internal heat with afternoon fevers, spontaneous and night sweats, and menstruation occurring every two months. This indicated a deficiency in liver and spleen qi and blood. I administered a formula to replenish the spleen in the morning and a soothing formula in the evening, frequently applying a scallion poultice to the swollen area. After two months, symptoms gradually improved, and necrotic bone was expelled from the ulcer. She continued with the previous medicines, totaling over three hundred doses until recovery.<a id="trans-588p" href="#orig-588p" class="marker">[588p]</a><br>A woman had a painful carbuncle on her left hand, experiencing itching, chills, fever, and nausea, with her left side becoming numb, and her pulse was rapid but intermittent. She reported that generally, sores should not be painless, and excessive pain is not advisable; if one feels anxious or distressed, treatment should not be given. Now she had itching, which was especially troubling; two doses of a life-rescue pill had no effect. Afterward, detoxifying agents were used, and the itching began to dissipate, but swelling and pain emerged. I said: Although the situation seems dire, the fact that she experienced pain is fortunate; however, the toxic energy had nowhere to escape, so I used acupuncture, and all symptoms quickly retreated. Then another detoxifying agent was used, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Su Xiang was robust but had a serious carbuncle on his back, with red streaks reaching his wrist, experiencing chills and fever, indicative of a surface condition. After taking a dose of the life-rescue pill, the red streaks quickly disappeared. Another harmonizing remedy was administered, significantly alleviating the symptoms. However, he then took a detoxifying herb, which caused thirst and fever, and the red streaks reemerged. His pulse was floating, large, and weak; this signaled an injury to his qi and blood, which was then treated with a restorative potion, and he recovered. It appears that after taking the life-rescue pill, the pathogenic energy of the sore had dispersed, yet taking the detoxifying agent again was unnecessary, deviating from the principles in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot;</p>
<p>A scholar had a carbuncle and his original qi was weak. I supplemented his qi and blood, leading to pus discharge and recovery. Later, due to overexertion, the scar began to itch, and he took a dose of detoxifying powder which resulted in a locked jaw and rigid tongue, with involuntary spasms in his hands and feet, accompanied by an uncontrollable flow of saliva. This was due to further injury to his qi and blood, leading to spasms. I prescribed a comprehensive restorative formula with an added amount of aconite, which he took, and he revived.<a id="trans-589p" href="#orig-589p" class="marker">[589p]</a><br>A man suffered from a carbuncle and took a lethal potion, leading to continuous sweating. The sore did not hurt, the fever persisted, and he experienced difficulty with urination. The excessive sweating depleted yang energy and harmed the vital energy. I prescribed two formulas containing ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, peony,防风 (notable herb), and five-flavored herbs, after which all symptoms retreated, but there was still concern about the difficulty urinating. I said: &quot;The reason for the difficulty is the excessive sweating; once the sweating stops, yang energy will recover and urination will resume.&quot; I continued with the previous herbs, removed 防风, added ophiopogon, and doubled the dosage of scutellaria and angelica. After four doses, urination became easier, and the sore healed.</p>
<p>My cousin, who lives in wealth, had a purple carbuncle on his right little finger, which some called a small sore. After puncturing it to draw blood and applying a cool medicine, his palm and finger swelled three to four times, darkened, and did not hurt. His mind became dulled, and he was restless, indicating a drain of vital energy and an accumulation of evil qi. I first gave him one dose of lethal dan and two doses of a life-saving drink, which helped slightly. Later, I punctured his hand all over, drawing enough fresh blood to fill a bowl, but the swelling extended to his arm and wrist, appearing as large as a gourd, with the fingers swelling several times, making it unable to drain. I used a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, and frequently moxibustion on the hand, which gradually reduced the swelling. However, he had difficulty with bowel movements and often experienced a loss of gas, indicating that the vital energy was sinking. To restore it, I added dried succory, nutmeg, evodia, and five-flavored herbs to the formula to solidify his stool. I also prescribed an infusion of ginseng (five qian), ophiopogon (three qian), and five-flavored herbs (two qian) as a substitute for tea. Additionally, I applied over fifty doses of tonifying medicine, and he gradually recovered. If this condition had initially not been treated with detoxifying agents, and subsequently not with strong tonics, it would have been difficult for him to survive!<a id="trans-590p" href="#orig-590p" class="marker">[590p]</a><br>A twenty-year-old person has had a lip sore for four days, with a purple vein leading from the sore to the mouth, nearing the throat. I said: This is a case of true Qi being deficient while evil Qi is strong. If the purple vein reaches the throat, it will be difficult to treat! It is necessary to needle the purple vein and the sore to draw out bad blood to release its poison. Additionally, I used an antidote, but both the head and face became swollen, and the patient sought treatment urgently. I said: My previous words were not mistaken! Upon examining the pulse, it was flood-like and rapid, yet when pressed, felt faint; the mouth was swollen and the needle could not penetrate. I used a stone to scrape the face and lip, drawing out a bowl&#39;s worth of black blood. Although the condition slightly improved, after a bit of broth, the patient ultimately did not recover.</p>
<p>The prefect Zhang Hengshan had a sore on the left toe that was unbearably painful. In a hurry, he applied thirty or so clove garlic moxibustion, and he could walk. Wanting a quick recovery, he applied cool medicines, which resulted in blood coagulating and flesh dying, with the toxic air becoming more intense. After moxibusting a hundred times and taking a life-saving drink, purple blood was expelled, and the poison was finally relieved. The bottom of his foot began to fester, with substantial decayed tendons and rotten flesh. He was about to heal when he mistakenly used a flesh-regenerating medicine, which exacerbated the poison, depleting his vital energy and preventing recovery. I treated him with a purging medicine because I was pleased with his constitution, and after over three months in a guest place, he finally healed. Generally, sores on the limbs can benefit from moxibustion methods that have rejuvenating effects. If cool medicines are used, they constrict the pores, block the pathways, and increase the evil Qi, often leading to failure to recover. If the poison is not fully resolved and flesh-regenerating medicines are abruptly used, it can lightly worsen the ulcer or, in severe cases, lead to life-threatening situations.<a id="trans-591p" href="#orig-591p" class="marker">[591p]</a><br>A man suffered from a boil on his toe, which was swollen, painful, and red. He applied a garlic poultice and used a formula combining ginseng, a detoxifying powder, honeysuckle, white angelica, and rhubarb, which relieved the pain; he also used a formula combining ten ingredients with tianhuafen and honeysuckle, omitting cinnamon, and recovered after several doses.</p>
<p>A man experienced a boil that caused itching, nausea, and vomiting, accompanied by intermittent dizziness. His pulse was floating and rapid. After receiving over twenty acupuncture treatments, pain began; a dose of a deadly pill caused swelling; he then took a formula with schizopeptic and detoxifying properties and recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had a boil resulting in fever and irritability, with a firm pulse; he was cured after taking a cooling drink.</p>
<p>A man had a boil in his chest, resulting in numbness throughout his body. His pulse was rapid and strong. Emergency acupuncture was performed to release bad blood, and after several rounds of moxibustion, pain began; he took a formula with the wind-cold dispelling properties and recovered.</p>
<p>A man had a boil on the back of his left hand. That day, his arm became numb, and the next day, half of his body experienced the same; he felt confused. He underwent over twenty moxibustion treatments but still felt no pain; after thirty treatments, the numbness ceased, and pain began after a hundred treatments. A dose of a deadly pill caused swelling; he then used a miraculous ointment and a detoxifying powder to recover.<a id="trans-592p" href="#orig-592p" class="marker">[592p]</a><br>An elderly woman suffered from severe pain in her big toe due to a boil and requested cauterization, but the person refused and only took a powdered remedy for detoxification, which led to a deficiency in genuine qi and an increase in evil qi, ultimately resulting in her demise. Though the powdered remedy can disperse the poison from superficial sores, ailments affect both the exterior and interior, vary in severity, and have different characteristics of excess and deficiency. Thus, it is inappropriate to use one treatment universally. Furthermore, at the extreme depths, medicinal power is hard to reach, and relying solely on medicine is often inadequate; cauterization would be a better approach. Therefore, for boils in the lower body, they should be treated with garlic-based cauterization: if painful, cauterize to the point of no pain; if not painful, cauterize until pain arises. If cauterization follows and there is still no pain, one should use bright cauterization and needle the areas around the boil to remove stagnant blood, placing a life-saving pill inside the boil and applying an herbal plaster. If the needle causes no pain or there’s no blood, one should heat the needle until red and repeatedly apply it to the affected area, using the degree of pain as the measure. If there is no pain and one sees a blackness like firelight, this indicates that toxic qi has entered the organs, which is untreatable. If the boil is on the hands or feet, with red threads indicating an attack on the heart and abdomen, one should prick until the stagnant blood is removed, and it’s advisable to take a remedy for detoxification. If the thread approaches the heart or abdomen, one should puncture the boil head to release the foul fluid, applying an herbal plaster afterwards. If there is numbness, one should take a life-saving pill. If the jaws are tightly clenched or there are throat ailments, one should hold one or two pills in the mouth. Sudden deaths in people are often due to boil toxins; one should examine the entire body with a lamp, and if any small sores are found, they should be promptly cauterized, followed by the intake of detoxification medicine or life-saving pills upon recovery. If a person sweats into the flesh and subsequently consumes food, they may develop boils; caution is necessary!<a id="trans-593p" href="#orig-593p" class="marker">[593p]</a><br>The &quot;Authentic Text on Surgery&quot; states: A student had a boil develop under the right cheekbone. For three days, it appeared like a fish eye, and when asked about his condition, he felt only slight itchiness, not constant pain. This indicates a toxicity in the lung meridian. A needle was inserted four to five tenths of an inch deep; it was as hard as bone and made a sound. Subsequently, toad venom strips were applied for three days, yet it did not decompose. This is a case of a stubborn and firm mass; the medicinal power was insufficient, so a three-ranked needle was used, inserted for seven days, and covered with a paper plaster. On the eleventh day, a chunk of the boil root came out, about the size of a finger. A nourishing ointment made of meat and jade red balm was gradually applied. Initially, a detoxifying powder with two qian of honeysuckle and five fen of angelica was taken. After the boil was expelled, a mixture of the Eight Treasures Decoction with one qian each of Trichosanthes fruit, Ophiopogon, Astragalus, and dried tangerine peel was used for over a month to adjust the body. Once the wound had healed and flesh had grown back smoothly, pearl powder was sprinkled on it, allowing it to form a scab and heal.<a id="trans-594p" href="#orig-594p" class="marker">[594p]</a><br>A man of middle age lost his wife and remarried a young woman who was spoiled and delicate. He took medicine to tonify his kidneys and assist yang, which led to harm to his kidney water, unable to regulate the heart fire. A blister appeared on his left cheekbone, first purple then black, numb without pain or itch. All that is black is the poison of the kidney channel, and its toxicity is not mild. Fortunately, the edges of the sore had not dispersed, which was still manageable; he used needles to puncture the sore. Other remedies were ineffective, so a thick paste made from ice and shells was inserted into the affected area and sealed tightly with paper to prevent air leakage. In the morning, he took a modified Eight Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water, at noon a tonic to enhance qi and enrich vitality to restore essence, and in the evening he used a pill of amber, wax, and alum to protect the heart and detoxify. On the eleventh day, the root of the sore combined with the medicine and fell off as scheduled. Next, he used a remedy to promote skin regeneration and aid in adjusting the spleen and stomach, fully recovering in twenty days. However, due to careless management and failure to maintain his health, nearly three years later, he again developed weakness and consumption, which led to his death.<a id="trans-595p" href="#orig-595p" class="marker">[595p]</a><br>A woman nearing her forties had a discordant marriage, troubled by various worries that lingered in her heart. It was the height of summer, while the year suffered great famine. She developed a carbuncle on her cheek, which only became visible six days later. By that time, the poison had already spread; her head, eyes, lips, and neck were all swollen, and her complexion was purple-red. I said: &quot;The flesh is not swollen due to a wound; the poison is turning yellow; this is a case of neglect.&quot; The woman lamented, shedding tears, saying: &quot;My whole family is doomed!&quot; I asked: &quot;Why is that?&quot; She replied: &quot;My husband is a worthless man. I have one daughter and two sons, all of whom are unmarried. If I were to die, the children would be left to him; they would surely become drifters in the future. Thus, if the woman lives, the family survives; if she dies, the family perishes; it&#39;s the natural order of things.&quot; Hearing this, I pondered deeply and wondered how she could survive. I could not bear to abandon her. Moreover, the condition of her wound was severe and beyond the power of medicine to heal.<a id="trans-596p" href="#orig-596p" class="marker">[596p]</a><br>It is my contemplation that one should first hire a poor person, feed them until satisfied, and then give them several cups of hot wine. Following this, needles should be used to prick over ten swollen areas, allowing them to suck out several bowls of bad blood. The area should then be washed with warm broth, and a concentrated paste made from toad venom should be applied. Golden powder should be sprinkled around, twice a day, morning and evening. Internally, one should use herbal formulas to protect the heart, along with medicated pills and calming remedies to reduce fire, transform phlegm, and relieve stagnation, in hopes of ensuring no transformation occurs.</p>
<p>After the blood is sucked out, the remaining swelling slightly decreases. On the sixth day, due to a quarrel between the couple, the swelling returns, worse than before. Needles should again be used to prick about ten areas of the most pronounced swelling, allowing three to four bowls of blood to be drawn. Small adhesive strips should cover the needle holes. The remaining swelling should still be treated.</p>
<p>The individual has lost a lot of blood, so they must be nourished. A restorative formula with ginseng should be supplemented with fragrant cyperus and fritillaria. After several days, the needle holes slowly produce pus, and the remaining swelling gradually diminishes. The original wound site becomes high and swollen again. The process of inserting toad venom should continue, and it too gradually becomes necrotic. Externally, promote healing of the wound and internally take remedies to relieve stagnation, harmonize the middle, nourish blood, and strengthen the spleen. Regulating these for a hundred days should eventually lead to recovery. </p>
<p>If this condition were to be assessed based on the appearance and color of the wounds, there would be virtually no hope for survival. However, through determined effort, life was sustained. Subsequently, the couple had two sons and one daughter, who married in succession. Their husband also held fast till the end, and it is said that they have now lived for over sixty years.<a id="trans-597p" href="#orig-597p" class="marker">[597p]</a><br>A woman, twenty-two years old, had a sore on her right ear that had protruded forward by an inch for two days. She asked me to examine it. The sore was the size of a mung bean, with a grayish depressed center; this was a case of abscess caused by toxins affecting the lung meridian. Upon further examination, I found that the base was soft and lacking consolidation, indicating a hidden condition of yin deficiency. Before I could perform acupuncture, her uncle asked what was wrong. I told him directly that it was an abscess. He laughed coldly and did not believe me. Consequently, I declined to use medicine, leaving it to their belief. They then sought another physician, who examined her and said it was a wind-heat skin lump, merely a minor ailment. The family then reported that another doctor had previously said it was an abscess, to which the physician nodded and laughed, saying, &quot;This is truly nonsense!&quot; The family was pleased. In the end, the patient received a prescription for a wind-dispelling powder, which completely absorbed the toxic qi, resulting in her sudden confusion, breathlessness, and ultimately death.<a id="trans-598p" href="#orig-598p" class="marker">[598p]</a><br>A young woman had a sore under her cheekbone for a year, which caused itching. I wanted to treat it with needles, but her family did not believe me. After I left, she applied moxibustion herself. The next day, the area around the sore began to swell gradually, and the sore became soft and depressed. After three more days, her face and head were extremely swollen, so she asked me to treat it again. I observed that the original sore had developed a black scab where the moxibustion was applied, and although it was dry and depressed, there was no pus. This indicated that the toxic energy had sunk in, and the flesh was already dead. Additionally, her face was puffy, shiny, and hot, looking distressed. This was a clear sign of weakened vital energy and strong pathogenic energy; even if treated, it would be ineffective, and she would inevitably die. Her family then regretted it. After half a month, she indeed passed away.</p>
<p>A man had swelling and pain in his palate for over a month, and treatment with herbs to dispel wind and clear heat proved ineffective. After another two months, the sore broke open, bleeding a watery fluid, and over a hundred days, over thirty small bones emerged. I applied a nourishing decoction and a wound healing powder, and after more than two months, the sore began to close. However, there remained a small opening, the size of a hairpin, connecting to his nasal passage, which made it difficult for the sore to fully heal, leading to a situation where he did not recover completely.<a id="trans-599p" href="#orig-599p" class="marker">[599p]</a><br>A man had a swelling on his left hip for over a year, which eventually developed into a rotten patch that oozed thin pus. After six months, a bone-like growth appeared, resembling an eagle&#39;s hip bone and measuring about four inches long. He took herbs to nourish the blood and strengthen the spleen internally, and applied Yuhong ointment externally. After a little over a month, it began to heal.</p>
<p>Another man experienced swelling and pain in the front of his lower leg for two years, with various medicines proving ineffective; this was a case of multiple bone sores. Eventually, a piece of bone broke through, and the flesh became rotten, while his vital energy weakened. He was treated with a tonic soup of Shiquan Dabu, adding Shan Zhuyu, Niuxi, and Mu Guo, but after over two months, it showed no signs of healing. Each day, he used a spirit lamp to apply heat, which helped another piece of decayed bone break through, revealing dozens of small holes. He powdered the two pieces of bone over a red-hot fire and mixed it into a wound-healing medicine to aid in healing. When asked why bone was used, the answer was that the bone originally held the essence of vital energy and blood, which is why it was used to restore the vital energy. This principle aligns with the natural order.</p>
<p>A woman had a swelling at the root of her upper left tooth resembling a grain of millet, hard as stone and painless; this was a multiple bone sore, and medication was ineffective. After three years, it began to hurt, oozing foul pus, and later, numerous bone fragments emerged, resembling a small tortoise; the swelling persisted. After some time, two small bones emerged, marked by a dry and rugged appearance, and the swelling finally began to subside. She was treated with Si Jun Zi Tang with added Sheng Ma and Chen Pi, and rinsed her mouth with a licorice decoction, applying a wound-healing powder three times until it healed.<a id="trans-600p" href="#orig-600p" class="marker">[600p]</a><br>&quot;The Meaningful Grass&quot; states: Huang Hongxuan suddenly developed a painful abscess on his arm, swollen and without a head, causing extreme discomfort that was unbearable. All external doctors agreed it was caused by heat poison. Upon reflection, he was usually indifferent, clear-minded, and calm, having no factors contributing to heat and poison, thus he didn&#39;t know the origin of his affliction. I urged Mr. Zun to deliberate with Changshan on the illness, suggesting we set aside our wine and food to focus on remedying it. Chang replied: &quot;Regarding this condition, let&#39;s first offer congratulations, then I will discuss it.&quot; </p>
<p>Every sore and ulcer has its cause: external causes include the toxic influences of improper weather and the infectious filth of daily rituals; internal causes involve the heat poison from rich wines and heavy flavors, or the fiery poison born from suppressed anger. The treatment of fire poison and all other poisons essentially originates from two extremes. Fire and vital energy cannot coexist; when cooled by coldness, vital energy dissipates. Hongxuan showed no signs of these causes, and thus failed to recognize it as leftover fetal poison. </p>
<p>Human beings inherit the vital energy of heaven and earth, differing in purity and turbidity; those possessing pure and refined essence can expect boundless fortune and longevity. However, having been conceived by parents, one&#39;s body inevitably carries a mix of desires and passions; what one relies on is the expulsion of that latent desire through eruptions like pox, thereby returning to the constancy of pure essence. Like mining gold, one must undergo the refining process in a red furnace, where impurities are separated from the pure shine.<a id="trans-601p" href="#orig-601p" class="marker">[601p]</a><br>I once observed the eyes of those who had developed smallpox using this method. After seven or eight days, when their eyes were opened, those with clear distinctions between black and white possessed pure essence, while those with red veins and a red membrane were mixed essence. As for those with blurry pupils and lacking the spirit&#39;s light, they were entirely devoid of essence. Hong Xuan had too many pox marks in his youth, which prevented his vital energy from being fully replenished. While the internal fire poison had been eliminated, stagnation within his body still remained; thus, the pox sores inevitably erupted in the areas of his hands and feet, particularly at the Qiuchu points, as scattered minor poisons had no place to reside and sought refuge in hard-to-reach areas. Today’s sores and abscesses appeared exactly at the Qiuchu acupoint, raising no doubt about the nature of the pox poison. The poison lurking under the elbows and armpits was harmless, but the pure body contained some impurities, which also constitute fine dust in a precious mirror, a slight blemish on a white jade. The day when the supreme harmony’s vital energy fills the entire body, it aims to expel all remnants from fifteen years past as pus and blood. Others may see this as poison, but I had long foreseen it as an opportunity for recovery. Is it plausible that one can be free-flowing in limbs yet not develop in vital matters? The treatment involves externally applying purslane gel for rapid breakdown, and internally using the Baoyuan Decoction to expel everything, while still employing the prescribed medication for pox and abscesses, ensuring prompt recovery, unlike the prolonged issues of sore poisons. However, if one fails to recognize the symptoms and indiscriminately administers cooling and poison-expelling medications, it simply amplifies the troubles. Who claims that minor external ailments can be dealt with without someone who understands how to negotiate effectively? If treated as prescribed, there will be a significant outflow of pus and water, and naturally, there is no need for wound healing and flesh growing treatments for spontaneous recovery.<a id="trans-602p" href="#orig-602p" class="marker">[602p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　夫疮肿之生于外者，由热毒之气蕴结于内也。盖肿于外，有生头者，有漫肿者，有皮厚者，有皮薄者；有毒气深者，有毒气浅者；有宜用温药贴熁者，有宜用凉药贴熁者；有可以干换其药者，有可以湿换其药者。深浅不同，用药亦异，是以不可不辨也。若疮肿初生似有头者，即当贴温热药，引出其热毒，火就燥之义也。于四畔赤焮处，捣生寒药贴熁之，折伏其热势，驱逐其邪恶，扑火之义也。夫生寒药势，气力精全，性味雄健。<a id="orig-84p" href="#trans-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>或有疗者，不本物理，皆通用药草膏之类，其有势力微者，是使羸瘦之人，敌其勇夫，不亦难乎！又有粗工不审逆从，便用寒药敷贴，趁逐邪毒，复入于内，归于肝心，十死八九矣。大抵敷贴之法，欲消散肿毒，血脉疏通，寒热逆从断其去就焉。苟使执方无权，安能散其郁结，欲不成脓得乎？其肿皮厚者，以故软布，或以纸花子涂药敷贴之，待其药干换；肿皮薄者，即用疏纱或薄纸涂药敷贴之，其药未干，即当换之。若至脓溃之后，即贴温肌生肉膏药，要在逐臭腐，排恶汁，取死肌，生良肉，全藉温热膏剂之力也。切勿用寒凉之药，水调贴之。夫血脉喜温而恶寒，若着冷气遏之，即血滞难瘥矣。<a id="orig-85p" href="#trans-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>　　　　　溻渍法</p>
<p>　　夫溻渍疮肿之法，宣通行表，发散邪气，使疮内消也。盖汤水有荡涤之功。古人有论疮肿初生，经一二日不退，即须用汤水淋射之。其在四肢者溻渍之，其在腰腹背者淋射之，其在下部委曲者浴渍之。此谓疏导腠理，通调血脉，使无凝滞也。且如药二两，用水为二升，则煎取一升半，以净帛或新绵蘸药水稍热，渍其患处，渐渐淋浴之。稍凉则急令再换，慎勿冷用。夫血气得寒则凝濇，得热则淖泽。日用五七次，病甚者日夜不住，或十数次，肿消痛止为验。此治疮肿神良之法也。<a id="orig-86p" href="#trans-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>　　　　　针烙法</p>
<p>　　夫疮疽之疾，证候灴一。针烙之法，实非小端。盖有浅有深，有迟有速，宜与不宜，不可不辨。盖疽肿皮厚口小，肿多脓水出不快者，宜用针烙。疖皮薄，惟用针以决其脓血，不可烙也。如未成脓已前，不可以诸药贴熁溻渍救疗以待自消，久久不消，内溃成脓，即当弃药，从其针烙。当用大针如似火箸，磨令头尖，如枣核样圆满，用灯焰烧，须臾作炬，数搵油烧令赤，于疮头近下烙之。一烙不透，即须再烙令透，要在脓水易出，不假按抑。近代良医，仓卒之际，但以金银铁铤，其样似针者，可通用之，实在泄其毒也。或只以木炭然火，猛烧通赤，蘸油烙之尤妙。<a id="orig-87p" href="#trans-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>烙后，实者捻发为纴，虚者以纸为纴，于纴上蘸药纴之，上以帛摊温热软粘膏药贴之，常令滋润，勿令燥也。夫疮疽既作，毒热聚攻，蚀其膏膜，肌肉腐烂，若不针烙，毒气无从而解，脓瘀无从而泄，过时不烙，反攻其内，内既消败，欲望其生，岂可得乎？嗟乎！此疾针烙取差，实为当理。然忌太早，亦忌稍迟。尝见粗工不审其证浅深，妄施针烙之法，或疮深针烙浅，毒气不得泄，以致内溃；或疮浅针烙深，误伤良肉，筋骨腐烂。或抑擦掀动，益加烦痛；或针之不当，别处作头；或即时无脓，经久方溃，遂使痛中加痛，真气转伤。详其所由，不遇良医也。以此推之，凡用医者，不可不择。纵常医疗之得痊者，幸矣。<a id="orig-88p" href="#trans-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>　　　　　灸疗法</p>
<p>　　夫疽则宜灸不宜烙，痈则宜烙不宜灸。丹瘤肿毒，宜溻渍之。肿皮光软，则针开之，以泄其毒。治疮之手法，殆不过此，而各有所宜。故《圣惠方》论曰：认是疽疮，便宜灸之一二百壮，如菉豆许大。灸后觉似焮痛，经一宿，乃是火气下彻肿内，热气被火导之，随火而出，所以然也。若其疮痒，宜隔豉饼子灸之，其饼须以椒姜盐葱相和烂捣，捏作饼子，厚薄如折三钱以来，当疮头豉饼子上灸之。若觉太热，即抬起，又按其上。饼子若干，更换新者，尤佳。若其疮痛，即须急灸，壮数多为妙。若其脓已成者，慎不可灸，即便针开之，即得瘥也。若诸疮经久不瘥，变成瘘者，宜用硫黄灸法灸之。<a id="orig-89p" href="#trans-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>其法硫黄一块，可疮口大小安之，别取少许硫黄于火上烧，用钗尖挑起点硫黄，令着三五遍，取脓水干差为度。若其发背初生，即宜上饼灸法，灸之。初觉背上有疮，疼痒颇异，认是发背，可取净土水和捻作饼子，径一寸厚二分，贴着疮上，以艾作炷灸之，一炷一易饼子。其疮粟米大时，可灸七七炷。其疮如钱许大，日夜不住灸，以瘥为度。以上数法，并依本方一一亲验，所以载之。愚谓疮医自幼至老，凡所经验，必须写之。尝记疳痿恶疮诸医不验者，取蛴螬剪去两头，安疮口上，以艾灸之，七壮一易，不过七枚，无不效者。又法用乞火婆虫，灸之同前法，累验之神效。人皆秘之，往往父子不传。又法赤皮蒜捣烂，焊作饼子，一如豆豉饼子灸法，灸之弥佳。<a id="orig-90p" href="#trans-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>　　　　　内消法</p>
<p>　　夫疮疽丹肿之生，皆由阴阳不调，荣卫凝濇，气血不流之所生也。古人有言曰：阳滞于阴则生疮，阴滞于阳则生疽，疮疽之生，有内有外，内生于脏腑胸腹之中，外则生于肤肉筋骨之表，发无定处，夫郁滞之本，则因血气不流，蒸气不能外达，留滞而成内热，疮疽所以生焉。若初觉气血郁滞，皮肉结聚，肿而未溃，特可疏涤风热，通利脏腑一二行，徐次诸汤溻渍，即得内消矣。不然，则治之稍慢，毒热不散，反攻其内，致令脓血之聚也。《内经》谓治病必求于本。盖疮疽本乎中热之郁结不通也，其风邪寒气所聚也，治之宜温热之剂和血，令内消也。辨之有法，须认风寒则肿硬色白，热毒则掀肿色赤，以为异也。如有气已结聚，不可论内消之法，宜用排脓托里之药，此皆先后之次也。<a id="orig-91p" href="#trans-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>　　　　　追蚀法</p>
<p>　　夫疮疡生于外，皆由积热蕴于内，《内经》谓血热肉败，荣卫不行，必将为脓，留于节腠，必将为败。盖疮疽脓溃烂之时，头小未破，疮口未开，或毒气不出，疼痛难任者，所以立追蚀脓之方法，使毒外泄而不内攻，恶肉易去，好肉易生也。若其疮纴，其血出不止者，则未可纴，于疮上掺追蚀之药，待其熟可纴方纴，若其疮纴之痛应心根者，亦不可以强纴之，悞触其疮，其焮痛必倍，不无变证，不可不慎也。若疮疖脓成未破，于上薄皮剥起者，即当用破头代针之剂安其上，以膏贴之，脓出之后，用搜脓化毒之药，取效如神矣。若脓血未尽，便用生肌敛疮之剂，欲其早愈，殊不知恶不尽，其疮早合，后必再发，不可不慎也。<br>　　　　　托里法<a id="orig-92p" href="#trans-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p>
<p>　　夫疮疽丹肿结核瘰疬，初觉有之，即用内消之法，经久不除，气血渐衰，肌寒肉冷，脓汁清稀，毒不出，疮口不合，成聚肿，不赤，结核无脓，外证不明者，并宜托里。脓未成者，使脓早成。脓已溃者，使新肉早生。血气虚者，托里补之。阴阳不和，托里调之。大抵托里之法，使疮无变坏之证，凡为疮医，不可一日无托里之药。然而寒热温凉，烦渴利呕，临证宜审甚缓急耳。<br>　　　　　止痛法</p>
<p>　　夫疮疽之证候不同，寒热虚实，皆能为痛。止痛之法，殊非一端。世人皆谓乳、没珍贵之药，可住疼痛，不知临病制宜，自有方法。盖热病之痛者，以寒之剂折其热，则痛自止也。寒邪之痛，以温热之药熨其寒，则痛自除矣。因风而痛者除其风，因湿而痛者导其湿。燥而痛者润之，塞而痛者通之，虚而痛者补之，实而痛者泻之。因脓郁而闭者开之，恶肉浸溃者引之，阴阳不和者调之，经络秘濇者利之。临机应变，方为上医，不可执方而无权也。<a id="orig-93p" href="#trans-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>　　　　　用药增损法</p>

<p>　　　　　痈疽证治</p>
<p>　　痈者壅也，为阳属六腑，毒腾于外，其发暴而所患浮浅，不伤筋骨。疽者沮也，为阴属五脏，毒攻于内，其发缓而所患深沉，伤筋蚀骨。凡年壮气血胜毒则顺，年老毒盛气血则险。有内因饮食积毒者。经曰：膏粱之变，足生大疔。荣气不从，逆于肉理。荣气即胃气，胃和则荣卫顺而滋养皮肤。膏粱金石，厚衣烘被，以致蕴热脏腑，湿热聚下，烧烁肾水，阴火炽盛，八脉沸腾，经隧凝滞，故水谷精微不能上行阳道，反逆聚肉之腠理而成痈。有外感风寒湿气蕴毒者。经曰：地之湿气，感则害人皮肉。又曰：诸痈肿筋挛骨痛者，此寒气之肿，八风之变也。盖风湿外侵，郁久为热，自膀胱左迁，移热小肠，小肠移热于胆，风性上冲，疮形高色赤作痛，小则为疖，大则为痈而已，非若疽之自里也。有因心气郁结，饥饱劳役，房室过度，水竭火炎，痰气凝滞而成。所谓相火能为疮疡，诸痛痒疮疡皆属心火是也。<a id="orig-197p" href="#trans-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>因火有君相，疮分微甚，或郁痛而不甚肿，或虚肿而不甚痛，虽然病该三因，总皆湿热。丹溪云：人身血行脉中，气行脉外，气血周流不息，惟寒湿搏之则凝滞而行迟，火热搏之则沸腾而行速。气为邪郁，津液为痰为饮，积久渗入脉中，血为之浊，此阴滞于阳而为痈；血为邪郁，隧道或溢或结，积久溢出脉外，气为之乱，此阳滞于阴而为疽。盖阳气无形，阴血有质，必湿热泣血而后发为痈疽。故《局方》曰：痈疽皆热盛血也。<a

<p>　　《灵枢经》云：荣卫稽留于经脉之中，则血泣而不行，不行则卫气从之而不通，壅遏而不得行，故热。大热不止，热胜则肉腐，肉腐则为脓。然不能陷骨髓，不为焦枯，五脏不为伤，故命曰痈。热气淳盛，下陷肌肉，筋髓枯，内连五脏，血气竭，当其痈下筋骨良肉皆无余，故命曰疽。疽者，上之皮夭以坚，上如牛领之皮；痈者，其皮上薄以泽，此其候也。《鬼遗方》云：痈之痛只在皮肤之上，其发如火焚茅。初如黍米大，三两日如掌面大，五七日如碗面大，即易治。如肿冷发渴发逆，治之难愈。疽发或如小疖，触则彻心痛，四边微起如橘皮，其色红赤不全变，脓水不甚出，至七八日疼闷喘急不止。若始发肿高，五七日，忽平陷者，此内攻之候也。又云：痈疽有三等，毒气浮浅属腑，毒气沉深属脏，毒气猛烈而行经络，或浅或深而定。<a id="orig-237p" href="#trans-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br>五脏六腑皆受其毒，难为调理。唯宜急切于痈发诸处，不问虚实，高肿起盛，光泽疼痛，只在皮肤之上，热极胀满，或有痒疼，别无恶候，初用温药平气，次用排脓发穴。　　治痈所谓平气者，乃犀角饮之类，其方用犀角、连翘、漏芦、甘草、当归、肉桂，皆发表之药也。所谓发穴者，乃棘针之类，用皂角刺为君，甘草、川芎、乳香为佐使，亦托里之药也。然不若洁古、东垣诸方发表托里为稳当。　　疽发诸处，不拘大小，惟起在背，广一尺、二尺、三尺，皮厚而紫黑，高肿不常，内疼如锥刺，攻击满闷，应四肢重疼，前心亦痛。余处发犹可，唯虚处及近筋骨处，若脓毒未溃，即伤烂筋骨。肉损为疽者，属五脏毒气深沉，多气伏硬坚实而不宜缓慢治之。须内实五脏，外透皮肤，令软匀和，即脓透，宜用内托实脏气之药，排脓匀气乃可，不比痈之毒气浮浅也，毋作一类治之。<a id="orig-238p" href="#trans-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a><br>凡一切肿疮，始觉患起高肿，五七日忽平陷者，此是内攻之候也，急以内托散及内补汤药，补填脏腑令实，最怕透膜，膜穿十无一生矣。娄全善云：痈之邪浅，其稽留壅遏，独在经脉之中，而专攻于外。故初发时自表便发热，患处便如碗如盆，高肿而痛，甚者纵欲下陷，缘正气内固不肯受，故或便秘，或发渴发逆以拒之，是以骨髓终不焦枯，五脏终不伤也。疽之邪深，其稽留壅遏，内连五脏而不专攻于外。故身体或无热，患处或不肿痛，甚者声嘶气脱，眼黑眼小，十指肿黑如墨，多死也。治之之法、痈之初发，当以洁古法为主，表者散之，里者下之，火以灸之，药以敷之。脓未成者必消脓，已成者速溃也。疽之初发，当以《鬼遗方》为主，补填脏腑令实，勿令下陷之邪蔓延，外以火灸引邪透出，使有穴归着而不乱，则可转死回生，变凶为吉。<a id="orig-239p" href="#trans-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br>今世外科，不分痈疽，一例宣热拔毒，外以五香耗其气，内以大黄竭其血，终不能自悟其药之非，惜哉！《集验》云：痈疽之名。虽有二十余证，而其要有二，阴阳而已。发于阳者，为痈、为热、为实；发于阴者，为疽、为冷、为虚。故阳发则皮薄色赤肿高，多有椒眼数十而痛；阴发则皮厚色淡，肿硬状如牛颈之皮而不痛。又有阳中之阴，似热而非热，虽肿而实虚，若赤而不燥，欲痛而无脓，既浮而复消，外盛而肉腐。<a id="orig-240p" href="#trans-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br>阴中之阳，似冷而非冷，不肿而实亦微而燥，有脓而痛，外虽不盛而内实烦闷。阳中之阴，其人多肥，肉紧而内虚。阴中之阳，其人多瘦，肉缓而内实。而又有阳变而为阴者，草医凉剂之过也；阴变而为阳者，大方热药之骤也。然阳变阴者，其证多，犹可返于阳，故多生；阴变为阳者，其证少，不能复为阴矣，故多死。然间有生者，此医偶合于法，百中得一耳。观此则痈疽但有阴阳深浅，内外虚实之分，而无大小之别。《精要》乃谓二寸至五寸为痈，五寸至一尺为疽者，谬也！<br>　　　　　脉法</p>

<p>The change to rich and heavy foods leads to the development of significant boils, akin to receiving from an empty vessel.<br><strong>[Commentary: &quot;High grain&quot; refers to rich flavors. Heavy flavors harm the body; excessive taste damages Qi, and if Qi is harmed, the muscles and surfaces become weak. The heat and toxicity arising from rich food go against the body’s natural patterns, leading to the formation of significant boils. When the surface is weak, heat and toxins take advantage, much like receiving from an empty vessel.]</strong><br>When the nourishing Qi does not circulate and is obstructed in the tissues, it results in abscesses and swellings.<br><strong>[Commentary: When there is a blockage in the body’s tissue Qi, and there is disharmony between Yin and Yang, abscesses and swellings arise.

<p>The so-called &quot;few needle stones&quot; does not refer to abscesses or sores. Abscesses and sores cannot be dealt with in just a moment. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The issues of abscesses and sores involve both the nourishing and defensive Qi along with the blood and vital energy being stagnant, harming the skin, muscles, bones, and tendons. This concept is different from the superficiality and depth that vary across the four seasons, or the few needle stones found in winter. An &quot;abscess&quot; implies accumulation, while a &quot;sore&quot; indicates blockage. This means that with heat and toxins accumulating externally and blocking internally, one should immediately puncture them, without delaying, to prevent the return of evil toxins.]</strong></p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Points</h3>
<p>When evil Qi overflows and becomes stagnant, heat in the pulse leads to decay in the flesh, causing the nourishing and defensive Qi to be obstructed, which will certainly result in pus; when internal decay affects the marrow and external disruptions harm the large popliteal muscle, it will inevitably lead to decay.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: Qi represents Yang; when evil remains in the skin and muscle layer, the clash between evil and righteous Qi results in symptoms of heat and pus formation. When evil Qi overflows, it obstructs the righteous Qi, leading to an interconnection between the Qi in the valleys and the pulses, causing heat internally and decay externally. If the nourishing and defensive Qi does not circulate, blood and vital energy will stagnate, resulting in pus obstruction. The popliteal region is part of the thigh; &quot;joints&quot; are where tendons and bones are interconnected. If evil remains in between, the tendons and bones must inevitably decay.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Lingshu Classic, Section on Sores and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that the intestines and stomach receive grains, the upper qi flows out to warm and nourish flesh and bones, and to open the pores; the middle qi flows like dew, ascending to the valleys and moistening the collateral vessels. The fluids harmonize and transform, becoming red blood; when blood is harmonious, the collateral vessels become full and then channel into the meridians, all being filled, and then into the main pathways. When yin and yang have unfolded, they move with the breath. Movement follows the meridians, and the cycle follows principles. It aligns with heaven, and must not cease. When examined and adjusted, it takes from the void to supplement the solid; purging leads to insufficiency, illness results in qi reduction, retention causes a sequential pattern. When taking from the solid to supplement the void, replenishment leads to surplus; when blood and qi are harmonized, the form and qi are sustained. I already know the balance and imbalance of blood and qi, but I do not understand the origin of sores and abscesses, the times of their formation and failure, the periods of life and death, how can this be measured? May I inquire?</p>
<p>Qibo replied: The flow of the meridians is unceasing, aligning with the heavens and corresponding with the earth. Thus, when the celestial bodies are misaligned, the sun and moon are eclipsed; when the earth&#39;s order is disrupted, the waters overflow; when grasses do not grow and grains fail to sprout, the pathways are blocked, preventing the movement of people. When communities become scattered, blood and qi are still present. Please speak of the cause! The blood vessels and defenses circulate incessantly, responding above to the stars and below to the cycles. When cold pathogens invade the meridians, blood weeps, and when blood weeps, it becomes obstructed. If obstructed, defensive qi returns, unable to revert, hence the occurrence of sores and swellings.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cold transforms into heat; when heat prevails, it rots flesh, and when flesh rots, it becomes pus. If the pus does not drain, it rots the tendons; if the tendons rot, they injure the bones. If the bones are injured, the marrow is consumed. When the bones are hollow and do not drain, the blood becomes depleted and void. Thus, the muscles, bones, and flesh cannot nourish one another, the meridians are blocked, and the five organs are affected, leading to death.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What distinguishes sores from carbuncles?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the nourishing and defending energies stagnate within the meridians, the blood stagnates and does not flow. Without flow, the defensive qi becomes impeded and does not circulate, resulting in heat. When the heat is excessive and unrelenting, it leads to flesh rotting; if the flesh rots, it turns into pus, but it cannot penetrate deep enough. The bone marrow does not become scorched, and the five organs are not harmed, hence it is called a carbuncle.&quot; The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;What is a sore?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the heat energy is intense and sinks, it depletes the muscles and marrow, linking internally to the five organs where the blood and qi are exhausted. Under the carbuncle, both tendons and good flesh are entirely gone, hence it is called a sore.&quot; A sore has tough skin resembling the hide of an ox, whereas a carbuncle has thin and glistening skin. This is the distinction.</p>
<p>Note: The circulation of human blood and qi interacts with the heavens and earth, resonating with the sun and moon, endlessly revolving through day and night. If any moment of circulation is halted, it stagnates and becomes an abscess, often leading to untreatable death.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On the True Nature of Pathogenic Factors</h3>
<p>Within the realm of insubstantial evils lies a person who experiences an array of sensations—sudden tremors that affect their form, leading to the fine hairs standing on end and the pores opening. When the evil penetrates deeply, if it strikes the bones, it results in bone pain; if it strikes the muscles, it results in muscle contraction; if it penetrates the vessels, it leads to blood stagnation, which, when obstructed, can result in abscesses. </p>
<p>(Note: The sudden tremors affect the skin, vessels, meat, muscles, and bones, causing pain, contraction, abscesses, and itching. If the Yin predominates, it results in cold; cold drives away the true qi, and if the protective qi is harmed, it leads to numbness. These are all products of pathogenic factors.) </p>
<p>When pathologic factors enter the body deeply, cold and heat clash. If retained for long, they manifest internally. If cold overcomes heat, it results in bone pain and muscle atrophy; if heat overcomes cold, it leads to decaying flesh and putrid muscles, producing pus and harming the bones. If there is discomfort in the muscles, they become unable to stretch; pathogenic factors reside in between and do not react, resulting in muscle spasms. If there is a buildup of qi that cannot be expelled due to retained protective qi, the fluids stagnate too long, forming what is known as intestinal spasms.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who suffer for a long time often develop a condition over several years; when pressure is applied, the affected area feels soft and has accumulated energy that returns to it, with bodily fluids retained and pathological energies trapped within. As time passes, it becomes more pronounced and eventually forms a lump. </p>
<p>When the area is pressed and feels hard, it indicates a deeper accumulation involving the bones; energy arises from the bones, and when the energy and bones are in unison, it grows larger and turns into a bone abscess. If the accumulation is in the flesh, vital energy returns to it, with pathology remaining and not dissipating—if there is heat, it transforms into pus; if there is no heat, it becomes a flesh abscess. </p>
<p>All of these types of energy can manifest in various places but bear consistent names. </p>
<p>[Note: The interplay of cold and heat refers to the two energies of yin and yang within the body. The body houses energy; energy returns to the body, representing the harmony between form and energy. Therefore, damage to the body leads to energy disorders, while damage to energy leads to bodily ailments. The accumulated energy pertains to the energy entangled with qualities of cold and heat, returning to the forms wherein pathology resides. Thus, these types of energy can arise from unpredictable locations and are consistently named as decayed flesh, eroded bones, tethered tendons, or former lumps.]</p>

<p>If the six yang organs are not harmonious, it results in a carbuncle. </p>
<p>[Note: Internally, the six yang organs represent yang energy; externally, the skin embodies yang. The classic text states: If yang energy is excessive and nourishing energy does not circulate, it leads to the emergence of a carbuncle. Hence, when the six yang organs are not in harmony, blood and energy become stagnant in the skin layers, resulting in a carbuncle—this illness originates from within and affects the exterior.] </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five internal organs are associated with five regions of the body: the伏兔 (Fú Tù) representing the kidneys;腓 (Féi) referring to the spleen;背 (Bèi) representing the lungs; the俞 (Yú) points of the five organs; and the项 (Xiàng) representing the liver. If any of these regions develop carbuncles or sores, the person will die. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: When illness arises, it is due to unpredictable emotions, irregular eating and drinking, insufficient yin energy, excess yang energy, and obstruction of nourishing energy, which leads to carbuncles and sores. When yin and yang are not in harmony, the two heats clash, resulting in pus formation. Can a small needle extract it? Qibo said: A sage cannot make something transform because of the evil that cannot be retained. Therefore, when two armies are arrayed against each other with flags raised and blades drawn in the field, this is not a matter decided in a day. The ability to govern the people so they follow commands without the threat of blades is not achieved in a single day, but through continuous teaching. To allow oneself to be afflicted with carbuncles and the accumulation of pus and blood is to stray far from the path. The emergence of carbuncles and the formation of pus and blood do not stem from heaven or arise from the earth, but are born of accumulated subtle influences. Thus, the sage governs when things are still formless, while the foolish encounter the consequences once they have manifested.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　夫痈疽疮肿之作者，皆五脏六腑蓄毒不流，则皆有矣，非独因荣卫壅塞而发者也。其行也有处，其主也有归。假令发于喉舌者，心之毒；发于皮毛者，肺之毒；发于肌肉者，脾之毒；发于骨髓者，肾之毒。发于下者，阴之毒；发于上者，阳之毒。发于外者，六腑之毒；发于内者，五脏之毒。故内曰坏，外曰溃，上曰从，下曰逆。发于上者，得之速，发于下者，得之缓。感于六腑则易治，感于五脏则难瘳也。又近骨者多冷，近虚者多热。近骨者久不愈，则化成血蛊；近虚者久不愈，则传气成漏。成蛊则多痒少痛，或先痒后痛。生漏则多痛少痒，或不痛不痒。内虚外实者，多痛少痒，血不止则多死；脓疾溃则多生。或吐逆无度，饮食不时，皆痈疽之使然，种候万端，要在凭详。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The causes of abscesses and swellings derive from the accumulation of toxins in the five organs and six bowels; they are not solely due to obstruction of the nourishing and defending (Qi). Their manifestations have specific locations, and their origins have particular returns. For example, when it manifests in the throat or tongue, it is the poison of the heart; when it occurs in the skin or hair, it is the poison of the lungs; when it arises in the muscles, it is the poison of the spleen; and when it appears in the bones or marrow, it is the poison of the kidneys. Manifestations below indicate yin poison; those above indicate yang poison. Externally manifested cases relate to the six bowels; internally manifested cases relate to the five organs. Thus, internal issues are termed “decay,” while external issues are called “suppuration.” Manifestations above are rapid in onset, while those below are slower. Conditions affecting the six bowels are easier to treat, while those affecting the five organs are more difficult to heal. Additionally, conditions near the bones tend to be cold, while those near the weak areas are often hot. If conditions near the bones persist for a long time without healing, they may transform into blood pests; if near the weak areas, they may lead to gas transmission causing leakage. When blood pests form, there is often more itching and less pain, or itching may precede pain. When leakage occurs, there is often more pain and less itching, or there may be no pain and no itching. For cases with internal deficiency and external excess, there is typically more pain and less itching, and if bleeding does not cease, there is a high likelihood of death; suppurative conditions tend to flourish. Excessive vomiting or regurgitation, and irregular eating and drinking, are all results of abscesses and swellings. The causes are numerous; in the end, one must rely on thorough investigation.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Five Types of Sores</strong></p>
<p>The five sores are all caused by emotions such as joy, anger, worry, and thought, exposure to cold and heat, excessive drinking of strong liquor, an indulgence in rich and sweet foods, toxic fish, vinegar, and sauces, and excessive sexual desire. These toxins accumulate and seep into the internal organs, and if left untreated for a long time, they begin to manifest. Their names are five: first is the white sore, second is the red sore, third is the yellow sore, fourth is the black sore, and fifth is the blue sore. </p>
<p>The white sore appears under the right nostril; it starts as a millet-sized bump, with a red root and white head. It causes numbness or itching, making one hate the cold and feel heaviness in the head, resembling the symptoms of a cold. The person loses appetite, feels fullness and discomfort in the chest, and may experience difficulty in breathing. Those affected who are in severe condition may die, but if not severe, it can be treated. This ailment lasts no more than five days; calamity is sure to follow. Therefore, it should be treated promptly.</p>
<p>The red sore appears beneath the tongue, with both the root and head being red. It causes pain, and the tongue becomes hard, making it difficult to speak. There may be feelings of shock, irritability, confusion, and excessive thirst leading to continuous drinking of water. If urination is obstructed, those in a frantic state may die, while those less affected can be treated. This condition does not last beyond seven days; calamity is certain to follow.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Both adults and children can suffer from it. Yellow sore appears at the edge of the lips and gums, its color yellow, containing yellowish fluid; it causes excessive eating and subsequent vomiting, numbness in the hands and feet, continuous salivation, abdominal distension with discomfort, and unawakened sleep, leading to death if severe, though it can be treated if caught early. Black sore arises in front of the ears, appearing like a scar, its color black and irregular in shape, causing severe jaw tightening and numbness in the lower back and knees. Otherwise, the illness may result in death within three years due to gradual depletion of kidney energy; thus, one should be cautious of desires. Blue sore develops beneath the eyes, initially resembling a tumor, its body hard and blue like stone, causing blurred vision and excessive fear, leading to restless sleep; if it doesn&#39;t heal over time, it may cause blindness or loss of the eyes. If one has this, calamity is certain within a year. The white sore is rooted in the lungs, the red sore in the heart, the yellow sore in the spleen, the black sore in the kidneys, and the blue sore in the liver. The signs of these five sores are significant diseases that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When carbuncles and boils first appear, they seem minor, and people often do not pay them any heed. However, this is truly a serious concern, and prompt treatment is essential. If delayed, the condition may worsen, leading to calamities which are numerous. A boil appearing on thin skin is termed a &quot;boil,&quot; while one on thick skin is termed a &quot;carbuncle,&quot; both requiring urgent treatment.</p>
<p>At the onset of a boil or carbuncle, it may resemble a small pimple, may be very painful, may cause mild discomfort, or may manifest as a small, rice-sized white pus; all these are early signs that need careful observation. If any small change is noticed, it is crucial to respond with urgency and actively treat it, as well as use painful methods to rid the body of heat toxins quickly. If no medications are available, one should apply cauterization of at least a hundred times directly to the area; for larger conditions, cauterize from multiple sides over two or three hundred times. Applying numerous cauterizations may be beneficial. Additionally, use cool medicinal remedies of various kinds, as they will certainly aid in a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>In terms of medicinal application, the treatment should be directly at the site of the boil, with the medicine creating an opening to allow heat to escape. Fire needles may also be applied directly to the area, and this will facilitate healing.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics state: Qi resides within the meridians; when both Qi and blood are stagnant, they congeal and form abscesses. It does not mention the heat that causes this, later leading to boils. Furthermore, when Yang Qi gathers, cold transforms into heat, and if the heat becomes excessive, it causes the flesh to rot into pus. Additionally, when the body has heat and is struck by cold, the pulse constricts and does not circulate, leading to the obstruction of heat and the formation of abscesses. There are methods of moxibustion and warming treatments. When heat has not yet fully developed, it is advisable to use cold medicines for application. Once heat has formed, treatments should aim to dispel the heat and prevent the formation of pus. For red, swollen areas with pointed heads, apply a mixture of sealwort and plaster. Another method is to mix vinegar with clam shell ash for application; replace it once it dries. Throughout my life, I have recorded all effective treatments for abscesses that I have encountered. Upon investigation of the sources of these ailments, many arise from medicinal substances, or some may stem from ancestors who consumed stones, leading their descendants to suffer from such diseases. It is particularly advised to avoid eating flour, wine, and garlic, and to be cautious with thick bedding in warm environments.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Boils and Sores</strong></p>
<p>The nature of the body must be nourished and maintained. If rest and activity are not balanced, numerous ailments will arise. Therefore, in the changing of the four seasons, yin and yang alternate. These two energies clash with each other, and during this time, there are bound to be sudden violent winds, thick fogs, extreme cold, and intense heat. If one does not avoid these at the proper times and encounters them unexpectedly, they can penetrate the body, abruptly affecting the skin, flowing through the meridians, and causing blockages in the natural openings, leading to stagnation of vital energy. This impedes the proper circulation of yin and yang, transforming into boils, sores, and toxic masses. As for boils, if not recognized early, they can lead to death before treatment can be sought. If one waits until they are fully developed to seek remedies, it may be too late. Hence, those who tend to their health must recognize these signs early. All wounds and sores cannot escape this principle. </p>
<p>For treating boils, one must pierce directly at the center of the pain, along with several punctures around the edges, to draw out blood. By allowing blood to flow and applying medicine, the medicinal properties can then enter through the needle holes, which is beneficial. If the treatment does not reach the interior of the sore, it will not be effective.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Method for Applying Surrounding Medicine</strong></p>
<p>For applying surrounding medicine, one must make great effort to stir it thoroughly over a thousand times. Since the medicine is thick, apply it lightly, ensuring that the opening is shaped like a goose egg. Thin paper must be used to cover it, making sure to tear it into pieces to avoid tearing and causing pain. Once the surrounding medicine is slightly dry, use the remaining juice of the mixed medicine to moisten it, to enhance the medicinal effect. Moreover, if the medicine is dry, it cannot penetrate the muscles; thus, moisture is needed to open the channels.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Technique</strong></p>
<p>When a wound or ulcer arises, the pain is fundamentally due to heart fire. Over time, yang energy rises, causing the flesh to fester into pus. If one opens the wound without determining whether there is pus or not, fresh blood will pour out—where would the pus come from? This will cause the patient to suffer from cold and fever, experiencing pain day and night without relief. First, press the affected area with a finger; if it softens, observe where the pus is collecting. Choose a favorable day and orient the knife upwards when making the incision to avoid damaging new flesh. Once the knife is withdrawn, take a piece of cotton paper with oil to help gather the pus; after half a day, it will be easier to extract. Apply pus-drawing ointment on the outside, and use a gathering powder around it for dressing.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion on Carbuncles</h3>
<p>Generally, there are thirteen types of carbuncles, which are categorized as blue, yellow, red, white, and black, corresponding to the five organs. There are also heat carbuncles, fire carbuncles, qi carbuncles, and cold carbuncles, each differing in urgency and manifestation based on their timing. At the initial onset, one may experience swelling before pain, or cold before heat, along with rigidity and heaviness in the limbs. Severe pain can lead to chills, fever, numbness at the edges of the sore, and eventually intense pain on one side of the body, with accompanying symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, coldness in the feet up to the knees, and purple-black discoloration surrounding the area, all indicating a serious condition. </p>
<p>Only the carbuncle of the itchy type has itching at both the beginning and end; its symptoms of cold and heat are similar to other carbuncles, but if the pain is particularly severe in the back, it may be due to external injury, in which case taking juice from goji root is very effective. For those with sudden throat pain, heart discomfort from cold and heat, or abdominal pain with chills and fever, precautions should be taken against developing carbuncle symptoms. </p>
<p>Typically, carbuncles appear near the mouth, inside the cheeks, or on the tongue, presenting as red and black dots that are painful, particularly affecting the heart. If not treated immediately, they can worsen day by day, spreading to various channels and causing severe harm, similar to an arrow piercing the body. After five or six days, if the condition worsens, toxic energy may enter the abdomen, leading to symptoms such as seeing fire in the eyes, confusion, irritability, vomiting, and a state resembling drunkenness or delirium, indicating that treatment is impossible.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

When they persist, they develop into rotten sores, with deep holes underneath like a large needle having pierced through. At first, it protrudes like a nail, hence the name &quot;disease sore,&quot; causing chills, fever, and stiffness in the limbs with pulling pain. Within a day or two, the sore turns black, charred, and swollen, and the root is hard and raised, making it painful to approach.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion on the Six Writings of Hejian</h3>
<p>Sores and abscesses belong to the category of fire; they must be treated by distinguishing between internal and external sources. As stated in the Inner Canon: &quot;Changes in rich and fatty foods give rise to large boils. Their origin is internal, manifesting externally.&quot; When one is in a state of vacuity, internal blockages express themselves outwardly, yet one may not know the path of their emergence; they all arise from a state of vacuity. </p>
<p>For instance, when the Taiyang channel is vacuous, the symptoms appear on the back; when the Shaoyang channel is vacuous, they manifest at the temples; if the Yangming channel is vacuous, the signs show at the beard; and when the Du Meridian is vacuous, they arise from the head. The classic states: &quot;The dampness of the earth can harm the skin and tendons when they are affected.&quot; If it manifests externally, a strong presence can lead to internal circulation issues. </p>
<p>If the pulse is deep and solid, one must first rectify the internal state to eradicate its origin. If the pulse is floating and large, one must first clear the interior, or else internal qi may be damaged. When there is a balance between internal and external, and the pathogenic qi is exceptionally strong, it obstructs the meridians, causing boils and swellings. The classic says: &quot;When the nourishing qi does not follow, it rebels against the flesh, thus causing boils and sores.&quot; This occurs due to a failure to clear the interior and to ensure smooth circulation, along with a breakdown in the mechanism of nourishment and defense.</p>
<p>The key to treating sores lies in clearly understanding the three methods: clearing the interior, smoothing out communication, and activating the nourishing and protective functions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of conditions that are internal and external, the pulse is deep and strong, with symptoms of heat and agitation, and there is no external visible inflammation or pain; this indicates that the pathogenic factors are deeply rooted within, thus it is essential to first clear the channels to eliminate the root cause. For conditions that are external but affect the internal, the pulse is superficial and rapid, with inflammation and swelling externally, and the symptoms are clearly manifested on the surface; this raises concerns that the pathogenic factors may be severe and could penetrate inward, thus it is necessary to first relieve the surface. For conditions that are between internal and external, there is neither obvious inflammation nor adverse energy externally, and the internal organs are functioning properly; it is understood that the issue lies within the meridians and that a balance between nourishing and protective energies is needed. After applying these three methods, even if the condition has not changed significantly, it will likely not deteriorate, and the pathogenic factors can be substantially reduced, leading to easier recovery. Therefore, the classic texts state: all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers belong to the heart fire. It also says: to understand the essentials can be summed up in one sentence; to not understand the essentials leads to endless dispersion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; says: pains, itching, sores, ulcers, boils, swelling, rashes, neoplasms, and severe accumulations are all due to heat. When the five organs are not in harmony and the nine orifices are blocked; if the six bowels are unbalanced, this can lead to accumulations resulting in boils. When close to fire energy, slight heat causes itching, severe heat causes pain, and nearby heat can burn and cause sores; all are manifestations of fire. Boils and swellings in a person arise from internal heat and external deficiency. When wind and dampness invade, they lead to sores and swellings. The lungs govern qi and are reflected in the skin, while the spleen governs muscles; when qi is deficient, the skin pores open, allowing wind and dampness to invade. If the spleen&#39;s qi is damp and there is internal heat, sores will develop. Swellings occur due to the accumulation of cold, heat, and toxic energies in the meridians, causing blood to stagnate, resulting in obstructions and swelling.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When wind pathogenic factors do not arise, there are no roots or heads. When cold and blood clash, there are roots and heads. If there is obstruction and excess, it leads to pus; if there is red swelling, it causes wind and qi to break through. Pain and itchiness from sores indicate pain as real and itchiness as false. The false is not caused by cold, but rather indicates an extreme of heat. Itchiness suggests a mild illness. Therefore, when fire is strong in summer, all things flourish and thrive. If one puts it to the fire or soaks it in broth, and the itchiness worsens, it is due to mild heat. The removal of itchiness implies that heat allows the skin to relax, the pores to open, and yang qi to be released, scattering away the heat. Sometimes, when summer heat causes skin itchiness, pouring cold water on it does not alleviate the itch, suggesting that cold can constrict, keeping the pores tightly closed, leading to stagnation of yang qi, and internal heat arises from this stagnation. All sores and ulcers are due to heat, and when they become infected and produce pus, it is similar to grains and meats that rot when heat reaches its peak, causing decay and discharge of foul moisture. The rotting and decay occur due to the transformation of water. Superficial and large swellings are boils, while deep and severe sores are carbuncles; when heat exceeds blood, it becomes a boil with pus. A sore with a head is a small ulcer. Rashes that are elevated and small are hives. Tumors that are red and inflamed indicate excessive heat. When a person is close to fire, mild heat causes itch, extreme heat causes pain, and being too near leads to burns and sores, all are manifestations of fire’s influence.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one experiences an itch or pain like a light prick of a needle, it is akin to sparks of fire igniting the skin. Itching is a manifestation of a graceful ailment. When treated with fire or soaked in broth, if the itching intensifies, it is due to a slight warmth. Consequently, when the itch subsides, the heat relaxes the skin, opens the pores, allows the yang energy to disperse, and the heat dissipates as well. In summer, if the skin itches and does not alleviate with cold water, it is because the cold can constrict, closing the pores tightly, leading to the accumulation of yang energy which cannot escape, resulting in internal combustion of heat.</p>
<p>If scratching alleviates the itch, scratching represents the action of fire; mildly it can still cause an itch, but when severe, it removes the itch. Scratching makes the skin feel spicy and corresponds to metal transformation, and since spiciness can disperse, when metal transformation appears, the fiery power is divided and resolves.</p>
<p>Some say that pain is real while itch is illusory; this does not imply that illusion is cold but rather indicates varying degrees of heat. If one questions why sores and ulcers are linked to fire and yet can fester and discharge pus, the reason is akin to grains, meat, fruits, and vegetables: when they reach excessive heat, they rot and dissolve into impure water. The process of decay is a result of water transformation.</p>
<p>This aligns with the principle of the five elements: when one aspect exceeds its limits, it paradoxically returns to control itself. Thus, if fire heat becomes excessive, it returns to transformation by water. Similarly, salt can preserve substances and prevent decay because its nature is cold water transformation, controlling fire heat to prevent it from exceeding limits, thus maintaining longevity. This principle applies to all things.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The changes brought on by rich foods are also due to an excess of flavors, where the nourishing essence does not flow as it should, working against the body’s natural processes and resulting in boils and swellings. The nourishing essence refers to the stomach&#39;s energy. When food enters the stomach, it is first processed by the spleen and then directed towards the lungs. The lungs then disperse this energy through the hundred vessels, which subsequently affects the skin and hair, and sends the essence down to the five organs and six bowels, forming a delicate balance. </p>
<p>Nowadays, those who are wealthy and noble do not understand moderation. They indulge in wine and rich lamb, mixing in heavy flavors, and over time this leads to an excess of thick, rich substances, which are the most yang in nature. These cannot navigate the body&#39;s cavities effectively and instead cause a reversal towards the yin pathways, resulting in a significant buildup of dampness. This creates a condition where the son (yang) opposes the mother (yin), leading to excessive fire. When this real heat becomes pronounced, it inevitably impacts the kidneys. If one is not careful in intimate relations and damages their true fire, then moisture will rise, transforming into damp heat, causing sores to appear on the back and head. This is one of the most severe forms of major boils.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If toxic gas escapes from the lungs or from parts of the spleen and stomach, it is the next level of toxicity. If it emerges from other channels, it is the next level thereafter. The places where damp heat toxins reside are inevitably subject to decay and corruption. Thus, the classic says that the transformation of rich foods leads to significant sores; those who are in a state of deficiency, like holding an empty vessel to receive substances, cannot help but absorb all. </p>
<p>The method for treating major sores must involve draining the nourishing energy. In terms of root and branch, the initial affliction is the root; without the use of bitter cold medicines as the main remedy, one cannot alleviate the suffering and pain. Many sores and ulcers are painful, often treated with frankincense and myrrh, combined with aromatic medicines to mitigate them; however, there is no rationale for significant reduction in pain, which is a misunderstanding. </p>
<p>If the meridians are unblocked and the viscera are free from stagnation, pain will surely cease. Pain should be alleviated with bitter cold medicines, and none fail to heal.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heart Method of Danxi</strong><br><em>By Zhu Zhenheng during the Yuan Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Boils and sores are simply a result of heat overpowering blood.<br>The six Yang meridians and six Yin meridians each have varying conditions: some have more Qi and less blood, some have less Qi and more blood, and some have both abundant Qi and blood; these cannot be treated uniformly. As for crucial points, those near the areas of deficiency, weakness, and thinness have been previously discussed by sages, but the details have not been widely noted in the texts. Among all the meridians, only the Shaoyang and Jueyin meridians are known to develop boils and sores, and thus they should be proactively prevented, as they have more Qi and less blood, making muscle growth difficult and causing wounds to heal slowly, ultimately leading to serious conditions. Rapidly using detoxifying and purging medicines to attack the Yin aspect of the blood can lead to calamity in no time.  </p>
<p>When Yang is stagnant in Yin, the pulse is floating, rapid, and wiry; when Yin is stagnant in Yang, the pulse is deep, thin, weak, and slippery. Treat Yang stagnation with cold and Yin stagnation with heat.<br>For individuals after middle age, boils should not occur. If there is just pain and swelling, along with signs from the pulse, which only show weakness, then nourishing Qi and blood should be given to ensure a favorable outcome.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one uses ordinary medicines to dispel heat, draw out toxins, and soothe qi, the harm may only be as evident as pointing fingers. </p>
<p>As for the method of internal support: in Hejian, treating swelling and burning on the surface, the root of the condition is not deep; the symptoms are superficial, and the pulse is often floating. If the disease resides in the skin and flesh, unless the qi is strong, it must have invaded internally. Urgent internal support is necessary to rescue the inner state, and one should prepare decoctions to eliminate moisture and soothe stagnation, ensuring the stomach qi is harmonious. </p>
<p>If conditions persist, re-decoct half the dosage and drink it. If there is constipation and heat, take a small amount of Huanglian Decoction. If there are slight loose stools and the heat has retreated, again take half a dose of the decoction. This way, both nourishment and protection can function together, preventing evil qi from causing internal injury.</p>
<p>However, the common practice often relies on pus-dispersing and internal supplementing methods like Shixuansan. Such remedies may be fine for minor sores or in winter seasons, but for ulcers in summer, using heating dispersing ingredients like cinnamon and wood can be concerning, even with ginseng and astragalus; it is difficult to rely on them.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When sores first develop, they appear as swelling, caused by the accumulation of qi and blood, which transforms into pus within the flesh, resulting in more pain than at the beginning of the sore. After the pus is discharged, the swelling recedes and the flesh relaxes; thus, the pain must gradually lessen. If the pain returns, it indicates deficiency, and one should tonify. There may also be cases where foul qi is involved, requiring harmonization. If it is due to an invasion of wind and cold, warmth and dispersal are recommended.</p>
<p>The modified All-Inclusive Decoction is used to replenish qi and blood after treating abscesses, advancing diet is crucial. This is because excessive discharge of pus and blood leads to deficiency in both yin and yang; without this medicine, how can one revive life? It is regrettable that practitioners do not differentiate between channels and meridians, nor do they adhere to seasonal considerations, and thus their understanding is merely superficial. Nowadays in surgery, when the swelling of wounds subsides and the pain eases, practitioners often mistakenly assume all is well without further investigation, resulting in deficiency symptoms appearing two or three months or even half a year after scabbing.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

<p>For boils, puncture the head with a needle or knife and apply toad venom. Afterwards, mix mung beans and wild chrysanthemums with wine from a type of grass, drink until intoxicated, and sleep. The pain and heat will definitely subside without needing to remove the boil; it will heal itself. To treat all kinds of sores, use purple stem chrysanthemums, where the roots, stems, and leaves can all be used. Grind them to extract the juice and drop it into the mouth to drink.</p>
<p>Essential Principles of Surgery 【Yuan, Qi Dezhi】</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment Method</p>
<p>The physician is the guardian of life. The pulse is the main pursuit of medicine. If a physician does not understand the pulse, it is like walking in the dark without a path, easily leading to disaster. The diagnosis for major pulses, women, and children’s ailments must be carried out before prescribing medicine. However, in the case of sores, many practitioners tend to overlook pulse diagnosis, focusing solely on external treatment. When faced with difficult conditions, they may call for specific pulse diagnoses but still begrudgingly accept superficial understanding. Alas, how trivial this is! The occurrence of boils and swellings arises from the imbalance of yin and yang, leading to stagnation of qi and blood. Without diagnosis, how can one discern the strengths and weaknesses of yin and yang or the gathering and dispersing of blood and qi? From this perspective, it is essential to trust the treatment of sores and swellings to the method of diagnosis; it cannot be neglected.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

Finally, I clarify the names and characteristics of pulses, their related symptoms, and the responses seen in sores and swellings. This should help those in the field of sore and swelling treatment to clearly understand what they read without any uncertainty, so that when faced with a patient, they can diagnose effectively, assessing the situation with clarity, as straightforward as distinguishing black from white.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Method of Correlating Color and Pulse for Nourishing and Protecting</h3>
<p>The principle of heaven and earth is known as Yin and Yang; within humans, Yin and Yang manifest as blood and Qi. Blood represents nourishment, while Qi represents defense. Nourishment resides within, and defense resides outside, thus nourishment flows within the meridians and defense circulates externally. The pulse is the precursor of blood and Qi. Without the pulse, how can blood nourish within? Without the pulse, how can Qi protect outside? The two support and move together, internally connecting to the five organs, six bowels, and twelve meridians, and externally moistening the nine orifices, four limbs, hundreds of joints, and countless hairs, circulating day and night in an endless loop, forming a continuous rhythm that converges at the wrist and manifests in the pulse. Therefore, it is said: Qi and blood are the spirit of a person. The pulse is the spirit of Qi and blood. Thus, at the beginning of treating illness, the five determinants serve as the criterion. The five determinants are the color pulses of the five organs. The pulse corresponds within while the color corresponds outside; the correspondence of color and pulse should be mutually referenced. Hence, it is said that a harmonious combination of color and pulse can ensure total well-being. When practicing medicine, one must first regulate and clarify color and pulse; if one is not proficient in this, even if they are intelligent and knowledgeable, they are still unworthy of trust.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Method of Holding the Pulse and Observing Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The practice of diagnosing by observing the pulse typically begins at dawn. At this time, the yin energy has not dispersed, the yang energy has not stirred, food has not yet been ingested, blood flow is not chaotic, the meridians are not prominent, and the collateral vessels are balanced. Therefore, it is possible to diagnose pulses that are in excess. However, in cases of sudden illness, one should not rigidly adhere to this principle. As mentioned in the &quot;Internal Classic,&quot; the proper method of pulse-taking is to maintain a state of tranquility and calmness. One should focus the mind, regulate breath, observe the essence clearly, examine the five colors, listen to sounds, and inquire about the patient&#39;s suffering; only then should one begin to press on the pulse at the wrist and differentiate between floating and sinking pulses. By using this approach, one can make distinctions that may determine life and death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one should consider the patient&#39;s body shape—tall or short, fat or thin, young or old, male or female—as well as their temperament, which can vary greatly. Thus, it is said: those whose body and energy are well-matched will thrive, while those with imbalances will fall ill. For example, the pulse of a maiden should be soft and weak, while that of an infant should be fine and rapid. For children around three to four years old, the pulse should be around seven to eight beats; this is considered normal and is quite different from that of an average adult.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

Press lightly to feel the response, then press moderately, heavily, and finally, observe responses from above and below. Assess by pushing outward and inward, then proceed to examine the &quot;Guan&quot; and &quot;Chi&quot; positions in the same manner. If you find differences in the three sections between floating and sinking, slippery and rough, slow and fast, and an imbalance in the pulse, identify the related illness by examining the external appearance and internal pulse conditions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Theory of Diagnosing Diseases based on the Three Positions of the Pulse</h3>
<p>The way of diagnosing signs is difficult for physicians. Unless they toil diligently beneath the lamp, commit their knowledge to memory, consult with teachers and friends, and remain unceasing both day and night—fluctuating between wakefulness and sleep, bowing and looking up, with their minds focused on this—how can they comprehend the profound mysteries? The ancients said: &quot;By feeling the pulse, one can know the disease; this is called &#39;spirit,&#39; for it helps one understand the intricacies of inquiry.&quot; They also said: &quot;By palpating the pulse to treat the disease, this is referred to as &#39;skill,&#39; which clarifies the importance of distinguishing the nuances of the pulse.&quot; Indeed, the three fingers may seem close apart by mere millimeters, yet they point to diseases that could be thousands of miles away. Observing the skill of distinguishing between pulses, people consider it to be challenging and call it &#39;spirit&#39;; is it not something that can be easily achieved? Upon examining the classics, there are three positions of the pulse: Inch, Bar, and Foot. From the base of the thumb to the highest bone, we travel one inch to signify &#39;Inch&#39;; one division above &#39;Inch&#39; indicates the base of the thumb; from &#39;Inch&#39; to &#39;Foot&#39; indicates &#39;Foot Depth.&#39; The area after &#39;Inch&#39; and before &#39;Foot&#39; corresponds to the &#39;Bar,&#39; where the front of the Bar is Yang, represented by the Inch position. The back of the Bar is Yin, represented by the Foot position.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The yang emerges and the yin enters, with the guan (barrier) as the boundary. The cun (inch) corresponds to the upper jiao&#39;s head, hand, and skin; the guan corresponds to the middle jiao&#39;s abdomen and waist; and the chi (foot) corresponds to the lower jiao&#39;s lower abdomen and feet. These three areas represent the major parts. The left and right hands correspond to three parts each, referred to as the six vessels. Additionally, there are the renying (human meeting), qikou (qi mouth), and shenmen (spirit door), each having different associations. The left hand in front of the guan is called renying, and the right hand in front of the guan is called qikou; the division after both guans is called shenmen. Thus, the pulse commentary states: the liver and heart are associated with the left, while the lungs and spleen are associated with the right. The kidneys and mingmen (life gate) both correspond to the chi. The soul and spirit and the valley spirit are all seen at the cun. The area in front of the left hand guan corresponds to the heart, whose meridian is associated with the shaoyin (lesser yin) and corresponds with the taiyang (greater yang) of the hand, with the small intestine as its fu (organ). The area above the left hand guan corresponds to the liver, whose meridian is associated with the jueyin (absolute yin) of the foot, corresponding with the shaoyang (lesser yang) of the foot, with the gallbladder as its fu.

Moreover, according to the discussions on the healthy person’s vital signs: when one inhales, the pulse moves once; when one exhales, the pulse also moves once. When breathing is steady, the pulse moves five times, harmonizing with the essence of vitality. It should be neither large nor small, neither long nor short, neither smooth nor rough, neither floating nor sinking, neither slow nor rapid; this is called the healthy person. A healthy person is one who is not ill. This is because the regular vital energy of a healthy person comes from the stomach. The stomach&#39;s energy is the fundamental energy of a healthy person. Therefore, since people consistently draw energy from the stomach, the pulse is fundamentally based on stomach energy. The &quot;Classic of Correct Theories&quot; states: when grain enters the stomach, the pulse pathway circulates. The &quot;Spirit Pivot Classic&quot; says: the stomach is the sea of water and grains. It also states: the pulse responds according to the four seasons, which indicates health.

It is also stated: a body that sweats but has no pulse is indeed pregnant. In treating a heavily pregnant individual, it is essential to inquire about her monthly cycle and observe her physical appearance before deciding on the treatment; this must not be neglected. The texts further state: observe color and feel the pulse, first differentiate between yin and yang. For yin and yang are the principles of heaven and earth. Therefore, those who treat illness must seek the root cause, which lies in the principles of yin, yang, seasonal changes, and the five internal organs. In terms of pulse, it refers to its floating and sinking nature. In anatomical terms, it refers to its measurements. The texts therefore say: the pulse is a method of yin and yang that corresponds to the five internal organs. This is to say, when exhaling, it involves the heart and lungs, and when inhaling, it involves the kidneys and liver; in the cycle of breathing, the spleen assimilates food flavors, and its pulse resides in between.

The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: all floating pulses indicate wind; all tight pulses indicate pain; all hidden pulses indicate accumulation; all thin pulses indicate thirst. A hollow pulse signifies blood loss; a long pulse indicates the resolution of qi, while a short pulse signifies qi illness. A weak pulse signifies restlessness, a large pulse indicates progression of illness, a floating pulse signifies surface issues, a sinking pulse signifies internal issues, a slow pulse indicates issues in the organs, and a rapid pulse indicates issues in the bowels. Furthermore, a robust body with a thin pulse and insufficient breath is dangerous. A thin body with a large pulse and abundant qi in the chest is fatal. When body and qi complement each other, there is life; when the three or five patterns are not in harmony, there is illness. When the three regions and nine positions are all out of balance, there is death.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is the great method of the sages for diagnosing pulses. Therefore, it is said: In treating illness, one must observe the shape, vitality, color, and texture, and treat accordingly without delay. Those whose shape and vitality are in harmony are alive, while those whose color and texture are superficial are easily afflicted. Pulses that follow the four seasons can be treated, while weak and slippery pulses indicate gastric energy, and these are all easily treated. However, if the shape and vitality are discordant, or if the color is lacking in luster, and the pulse reverses the four seasons, or if the pulse is strong and firm, these cannot be treated. The classic text states that one must observe the four difficulties and clearly inform the patient. Additionally, if the illness is hot with a calm pulse, or if there is diarrhea with a strong pulse, or if there is blood loss with a solid pulse, or if there is restlessness after sweating, these are all difficult to treat. For those with sores or abscesses, if there is a large discharge of pus and blood, and the pulse is slippery and rapid, it is difficult to treat. Generally, if there is a large purulent discharge, or if it resembles clear fluid, and the pulse is slippery and widely dispersed with symptoms of cold, heat, and thirst, treatment will be ineffective. If lung sores are present, with coughing up pus and blood and a pulse that feels surging and slippery, treatment will be difficult for recovery. In general, if the pulse is floating and rapid, there should be fever but a reaction of aversion to cold, accompanied by tension in the head and neck, and discomfort in the limbs, or if there is shivering and severe thirst, there will be a painful area wanting to swell.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Twenty-Six Types of Pulses and Their Corresponding Diagnoses</strong></p>
<p>The pulse can generally be categorized into twenty-six types, which serve as a framework for pulse diagnosis. In detail, even slight discrepancies may lead to significant misdiagnoses. In summary, the analysis revolves around the concepts of Yin and Yang, and the interplay of deficiency and excess. In consideration of various diagnostic traditions, this text condenses their essential points while eliminating superfluities to convey their core meanings.</p>
<p>The floating pulse is felt beneath the fingers; pressing down does not reveal it, but lifting it does; when sought repeatedly, it appears overly pronounced, glancingly observable between the skin and flesh. Its significance relates to superficial conditions, possibly attributable to wind or deficiency. A floating and broadly dispersed pulse indicates issues with the heart, while a floating and short pulse points to the lungs. A floating and rapid pulse suggests heat; if it is rapid without heat but instead accompanied by chills, it indicates sores or ulcers.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The diagnosis of the flood pulse is characterized by a large and superficial feel, with a broad press that fills all three regions, resembling the rushing flow of water and the surging of waves. It indicates an accumulation of heat and swelling in the blood. It is stated: a large flood pulse suggests the progression of sores and boils. If a sore or boil has yet to form pus, it is advisable to drain it. After the pus has erupted, if the pulse is seen as large and flood-like, treatment is difficult; if there is spontaneous diarrhea, it cannot be treated.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the slippery pulse is characterized by a combination of fullness and largeness, flowing smoothly like pearls, and when pressed, it feels slippery. It indicates either heat or deficiency; this is a yang pulse. In the case of sores and boils, if the pus has not yet erupted, it is advisable to internally dispel it. Once the pus has erupted, it is advisable to aid in expulsion. This is referred to as beginning with heat and ending in deficiency.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of the rapid pulse, when pressed, moves with breathing, influencing the six positions; it appears slippery and rapid. If it is superficial and rapid, it indicates exterior heat; if it is deep and rapid, it indicates internal heat. Furthermore, it is said: all rapid pulses suggest heat.

<p>The diagnosis of a scattered pulse appears floating and dispersed; pressing it reveals that it disperses and is prone to leaving; lifting it shows it is large but weak. This indicates that the energy is abundant, but the blood is deficient, with an exterior presence but an interior absence. After sores and swelling have burst with pus, and the pain persists without healing, the pulse will be abundant, slippery, coarse, and scattered, making it difficult to treat due to the deficiency of the righteous Qi and the presence of pathogenic Qi. It is also stated that if the limbs feel heavy and the lung pulse is large, it results in death, which refers to the floating and dispersing pulse.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of a hollow pulse, it appears floating and soft; when pressed, it is empty in the center but firm on both sides. This indicates blood deficiency or may be indicative of blood loss leading to sores and swelling. If a hollow pulse is detected, it can be treated easily after the pus bursts, as the pulses correspond to the ailment. </p>

<p>For diagnosing a solid pulse, when pressing it, it feels large and tense, both deep and superficial, conveying a strong solidity. If there are nodules or swellings due to scrofula and a solid pulse is detected, should one not reduce it internally?</p>
<p>In diagnosing a solid pulse, pressing it reveals strength, resembling a knot, thus deemed solid. The classics state: when evil qi prevails, it presents as solid, and in chronic illness, it tends to be vacuous. This condition is most to be avoided. For those suffering from sores and boils who exhibit this pulse, it is advisable to purge urgently, as the evil qi and the organs are both solid.</p>
<p>For diagnosing a wiry pulse, pressing it feels tight and taut; if it appears tense, it is termed wiry. It feels rigid like an unyielding string, and unlike the common sensation of motion, it remains firm. A spring pulse that is floating and wiry but not often observed indicates fluid stagnation leading to pain, signifying coldness and vacuity.

<p>The examination of the short pulse shows that when pressed or lifted, it does not reach its original position. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: a short pulse indicates qi illness, as it lacks stomach qi. Diseases with a short pulse are generally difficult to treat. In cases of ulcers and swellings, a short pulse indicates a deficiency of true qi.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of a slow pulse is that when lifted, it comes up slowly, and only with steady breathing can there be three beats; its appearance is somewhat slow but slightly delayed. In chronic diseases, this pulse is favorable; in new diseases, it indicates exhausted vital energy. After sores or swellings have ruptured, it will heal itself.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of a relaxed pulse shows a resemblance to a slow pulse, but it is slightly quicker. Zhong Jing said: A yang pulse that is floating, large, and moist, and a yin pulse that is also floating, large, and moist, are both referred to as relaxed when yin and yang are equal. A long and relaxed pulse indicates recovery from numerous ailments. Generally, after sores or swellings have ruptured, if the pulse is dry, slow, and relaxed, healing is easy, as the pulse state corresponds to the presence of stomach energy.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of a deep pulse shows inadequacy when lifted; pressing it reveals it feels like rotten cotton, indicating that evil energy resides within the organs.

<p>The &quot;cùn,&quot; &quot;guān,&quot; and &quot;chǐ&quot; refer to the positions of the pulse. &quot;Fú,&quot; &quot;chén,&quot; &quot;huá,&quot; and &quot;mèn&quot; represent the qualities of the pulse. Establishing the position and understanding the signs indicated by the pulse are the essential methods of diagnosis. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: Generally, if the pulses in both hands across the three regions are smooth and slow, neither floating nor sinking, neither long nor short, and are even in their rhythm, there is no illness.</p>
<p>A floating pulse at the cùnkǒu indicates a wind injury; a tight pulse indicates a cold injury; a string-like pulse suggests an injury from food. A floating and relaxed pulse indicates a stroke; a floating and rapid pulse indicates a headache. A floating and tight pulse suggests cold above the diaphragm and cold drinks below the ribs. A sinking and tight pulse indicates underlying cold and accumulated pain in the heart area. A sinking and weak pulse indicates deficiency damage; a relaxed and slow pulse suggests cold deficiency; a faint pulse indicates both blood and qi deficiency. A string-like pulse indicates headache with fluid in the heart area. A double string-like pulse suggests pain under both ribs. An incomplete pulse indicates lack of progress; a completely absent pulse suggests no treatment available. A pulse that feels like thick soup indicates weak yang qi; a consistent, thin pulse like spider silk indicates declining yang qi.</p>
<p>The guān region governs matters of the central and abdominal areas. If the pulse is steady and slow, there is no illness. A floating pulse indicates fullness in the abdomen with lack of appetite, suggesting a weak stomach. A slippery pulse indicates heat in the stomach. A rapid pulse indicates heat accumulation in the central region.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

Although there may be false heat, one should not attack it vigorously; care must be taken to prevent excess heat from leading to cold. If the pulse is firm and solid, it suggests abdominal fullness with gurgling sounds, blocked flow, and potentially intense pain, indicating qi counterflow. If the pulse is hollow, it may suggest blood loss. A firm, large pulse that does not diminish under pressure and feels strong indicates that the middle burner is solid, with a blockage contained in the stomach. A slightly floating pulse may indicate undigested food, as well as gut disturbances causing anxiety. </p>
<p>The尺脉 relates to the lower burner—waist, kidneys, and shins. A floating pulse indicates difficulties with wind heat affecting urination. A沉 pulse suggests pain in the lower back with insufficient kidney qi. A rapid pulse indicates heat and pain below the navel, with red urine and aversion to cold. A slow pulse signifies cold in the lower burner with yin deficiency. A tight pulse suggests urgent pain in the lower abdomen. A relaxed pulse may indicate weakness in the legs, swelling, or paralysis. A weak pulse points to cold below with declining kidney qi. A soft pulse indicates inability to retract the legs and difficulties with wind-induced paralysis affecting urination. A伏 pulse suggests abdominal pain from hernias, and food fails to digest. A thin pulse signifies loose stools and cold below. A hollow pulse indicates difficult urination with blood loss. A firm and small pulse suggests cold paralysis in the knees with pain in the feet.

The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states: Yang pathogens are felt as floating and surging, while Yin pathogens present as subtle and fine. Pathogens from food and water appear as solid and firm, and chills manifest as thin and tight. It further explains: a floating and slippery pulse indicates food stagnation, a short and slippery pulse signals a wine-related illness, a slow and slippery pulse points to bloating, a large and surging pulse suggests cold damage, a floating and rapid pulse indicates a cold from wind, a floating and urgent pulse signifies undigested food and an unrefined spleen, a sinking and tight pulse denotes a buildup of cold and Yin pain, a floating and relaxed pulse indicates skin numbness, a slippery and dispersed pulse signals paralysis, a slow and relaxed pulse points to cold symptoms, a floating and thin pulse indicates cholera, a weak and thin pulse suggests gastroesophageal reflux, a tight and slippery pulse indicates retching, a short and rapid pulse points to heart pain, a tight and rapid pulse indicates malaria, a tight and hurried pulse signifies corpse evocation, a solid yet small and firm pulse indicates a deep internal illness and coldness, a floating, slippery, and tight pulse suggests an external illness with heat, a short and urgent pulse indicates an upper body problem, a long and relaxed pulse suggests a lower body problem, a long and tight pulse indicates liver issues, a slippery and surging pulse signals heart problems, a subtle and soft pulse relates to spleen issues, a floating and thin pulse suggests lung issues, and a sinking and tight pulse indicates kidney problems. Additionally, it notes: all floating pulses can signify wind or deficiency, all tight pulses indicate pain or accumulation, all thin pulses relate to obstruction, all tightness points to fluid retention, all rapid pulses indicate heat, all slow pulses signify cold, a hollow pulse indicates blood loss, and a soft pulse indicates deficiency. If the pulse is deep and dense with numbness in the limbs, it indicates a loss of vitality; if it is large and knotted, it suggests a curse. If the pulse fluctuates between large and small, short and long, it indicates spiritual disturbance.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Caution in Treating Quirks</h3>
<p>Generally, when sores or boils appear, they are often only the size of millet or sorghum grains, and their appearance is very slight. Many people do not take this seriously, but this conceals a great danger, and it is advisable to identify it quickly—one should not ignore it. If one can prevent it before it manifests, treat it before it develops, or recognize it in the morning and treat it by evening, and seek care from a skilled doctor, then there will certainly be no risks or difficulties. However, if one persists in procrastination and neglect, consulting incompetent doctors and allowing pus and blood to accumulate, leaving it to fate and waiting helplessly for death, is it not a long way from the right path? This can lead to the deterioration of muscles and bones, perforating internal organs, resulting in death for eight or nine out of ten cases. Should one not exercise caution? Those suffering from sores and boils who entrust their lives to incompetent doctors and act arbitrarily will face imminent danger. But if one seeks care from a skilled doctor, recovery can be ensured.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

The void is difficult to replenish, while the reality is easy to leach. The methods of replenishing and leaching should not be taken lightly. If there is even a slight deviation, the consequences can be severe. </p>
<p>Moreover, the manifestations of the void and reality are manifold and cannot be overlooked. There are the void and reality of wounds, and within the organs, qi, blood, and the true or false conditions above and below, each has its own void and reality, hence the differences. </p>
<p>To discuss them separately: swollen and hard, with thick pus indicates the reality of the sore, while soft and swollen, with thin pus indicates the void. In cases of diarrhea with rumbling intestines, inability to take in food, vomiting at irregular times, cold hands and feet, weak pulse and cold skin, spontaneous urination, or difficulty urinating, along with slippery and frequent stools, lack of voice, and mental dullness, all point to the void of the organs. </p>
<p>On the other hand, hard stools, scanty urination, normal appetite, abdominal fullness and bloating, chest constriction and discomfort, pain in the limbs, bitter mouth and dry throat, irritability and excessive thirst, body heat and strong pulse, along with mental cloudiness, all indicate the reality of the organs.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For all kinds of sores and boils, if the pus is clear and thin, the wound edges do not close, the pus does not appear red, and the flesh is cold and the skin pale, accompanied by spontaneous sweating, this indicates a deficiency of qi and blood. If there is swelling with redness, alternating cold and heat, pain in the skin, thick and sticky pus, and feelings of heaviness in the head, this indicates an excess of qi and blood. If there is headache and nasal congestion, red eyes and a shocked heart, difficulty in the throat, mouth sores, thirst for cold drinks, speaking while asleep and grinding teeth, this indicates an excess in the upper body. If there is smooth and unblocked flow, ease in bowel movements, heaviness in the waist and legs, and restlessness in sleep, this indicates a deficiency in the lower body. If there is discomfort in the shoulders and neck, heaviness in the limbs, inability to focus the gaze, diminished eyesight, indifference to food, hoarse voice and ashen appearance, with swelling in the limbs, this indicates a deficiency of true qi. If the swelling is severe, with intolerable pain, not resolving for several days, alternating cold and heat, constipation, painful urination, mental agitation, confusion, and restlessness, this indicates an excess of pathogenic qi. It is also said that when true qi is depleted, there is deficiency; when pathogenic qi prevails, there is excess. It is further stated that all pains are due to excess, while itching indicates deficiency. Additionally, when diagnosing, a pulse that is large and rapid denotes excess, while a pulse that is fine and soft indicates deficiency. For deficiency, one should nourish it and harmonize the qi, facilitating the flow. For excess, one should drain it, promoting smoothness and guiding the qi naturally. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that if blood is in excess, it should be drained; if qi is deficient, it should be gently drawn out.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Method of Differentiating Depth and Severity</h3>
<p>Wounds can manifest in various forms, and to discern their depth, one must follow established principles. If one lacks prior knowledge of medical theories and arbitrarily imposes personal interpretations, how can they adhere to the proper standards? I once heard that the ancients said: &quot;Too much leads to confusion, while too little brings understanding.&quot; Simply put, wounds can generally be classified into three categories: those that are raised and soft indicate an issue with the blood; those that are swollen and firm indicate a problem with the muscles and bones; and those where the flesh and skin colors are indistinguishable indicate a problem with the bone marrow. Furthermore, when treating wounds, if the swollen area is deeply rooted and large, it is deep; if it is small and floating, it is shallow. Also, if a person feels strong fever, chills, tightness, headaches, restless mind, and desires cold drinks at the onset of the wound, the condition is likely severe. Conversely, if a person feels balanced in their daily routine and maintains usual eating habits despite the wound, their condition is likely mild. When a malignant sore first appears, if its head resembles a grain of rice and there is slight pain or itchiness, touching it may cause it to spread; if this occurs, one should quickly take remedies like rhinoceros horn soup or reed decoction, as well as gas-dispersing pills to promote flow and relieve blockage, alongside the use of detoxifying baths. For milder conditions, gentle dressings should suffice. Thus, the distinction between depth and severity is crucial throughout the process.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Differentiating Pus Method</h3>
<p>For diseases characterized by sores and swellings, where toxic qi has already congealed, one should not discuss methods to dissolve it internally. Instead, one must differentiate between the nature of the pus—its maturity and depth—without recklessly opening it. Assess whether it is permissible to proceed, to avoid dangerous outcomes. In general, with sores and boils, pressing firmly elicits pain, indicating deep pus; light pressure causing pain indicates superficial pus; and if pressing does not result in significant pain, pus has not yet formed. If pressing brings back pain, there is pus present; if not, there is none. If it isn’t pus, it must be water. If the swelling is soft and painless, it is a blood tumor. If the swelling gradually increases without severe heat, accompanied by occasional pulling pain, it indicates an air tumor. When air is trapped and slightly swollen, lingering without dissipating, it may later develop into pus; this is caused by the interplay of cold and heat. If accumulation persists for a long time, extreme yin can give rise to yang, causing cold to transform into heat, which often leads to the formation of fistulas upon rupture; therefore, it is advisable to take internal medicines early to alleviate it. For various goiters, warts, and other growths, they will all internalize and rupture with age. If treated while young, there may be no future concerns. Moreover, regarding the treatment of abscesses and boils, if one covers them with a hand, those that are very hot typically will soften and form pus.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the upper layer has a thin skin that has peeled off, the pus is shallow; if the swelling is not very hot, the pus has not yet formed. In cases of scrofulous tuberculosis, if there are chills and fever, thirst, and the condition has lasted for a long time without improvement, the person’s complexion will be sallow and yellow, suffering from heat rising; this indicates that pus has already formed. As for internal sores and abscesses in the viscera and intestines, the illness is hidden and not visible; as the eyes do not see, and the hands cannot approach, it is extremely difficult. One can diagnose by examining the pulse. If someone has a gastric abscess, one should examine the stomach pulse. The renying (meeting the person) pulse pertains to the stomach. If the pulse is deep and thin, it indicates rebellious qi, which can lead to heat accumulation in the stomach that does not disperse, resulting in an abscess in the epigastrium. If the pulse is flooding and rapid, the pus has already formed. If the pulse is slow and tight, though the pus has not fully developed, there is already stagnant blood, and it requires urgent treatment. Otherwise, the evil poison will attack internally, rotting the intestines and stomach, making it irreparable. Additionally, regarding lung abscesses, it is said: if it begins to emerge, it can be treated; if pus has formed, it leads to death. One must be cautious. If the pus is soft and resembles rice porridge for a long time, it should not be treated. If one vomits pus and then stops, it can heal on its own. Furthermore, regarding intestinal abscesses, it is said: if there is a sore around the navel and pus comes from the sore, if there is discharge from the navel, only those who have bloody pus with their stools can heal themselves.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

<p>The terms for sores, boils, and swellings are numerous and varied, as recorded in many texts, leading to confusion. When faced with illness, treatment may lack foundation, resulting in uncertainty. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: those who understand the essentials can finish with a single word; those who do not can only wander endlessly. Though I may be lacking in talent, I will attempt to articulate the essentials. </p>
<p>Heat originating between the skin leads to small swellings, which can never exceed two or three fen; this is a boil. When heat accumulates in the six bowels and erupts between the outer muscles, causing severe swelling with shiny, soft skin that spreads broadly, this is a carbuncle. When wind heat from the five organs attacks the muscles and bones, and violent wind toxins appear, starting as a head like a withered white thorn, touching it evokes concern; this is a sore. Boils and carbuncles can spread from the six bowels, akin to a wildfire consuming everything, while sores originate in the five organs and are difficult to treat, like a fire in a pottery workshop consuming the marrow. Boils are easier to treat but healing can be slow due to the need for rest; sores are harder to treat but easier to recover from.</p>
<p>Both boils and sores should be cauterized when they first appear because their energy is superficial, allowing heat to disperse quickly. Sores, however, should be treated without cauterization because their energy is deep and must reach its source. All external sores and boils arise from internal heat and toxins. Understanding these three conditions, the characteristics of swellings and toxins can be inferred.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the skin slightly rises and the flesh thickens, causing pain or itchiness, if it is removed and does not adhere, it is called swelling. There are those caused by wind, and those caused by the clash of wind and heat, which result in hard, white swelling; if caused by heat, the swelling is red and hot; if caused by the clash of wind and heat, it persists for a long time. The heat dominates over the wind; if not treated promptly, blood will not circulate, and together with qi, it may lead to pus formation. </p>
<p>It is said that excessive wind leads to itching, while excessive heat leads to pain. This is a diagnostic sign. There is also a condition known as &quot;dan poison,&quot; where the body&#39;s skin suddenly turns red, resembling the application of a red pigment, thus named. In the vernacular, it is referred to as a &quot;red tumor.&quot; Sometimes it results from a wound that has been inadvertently touched, with surrounding areas becoming red and hot, referred to as a sore tumor. </p>
<p>All cases of dan poison are characterized by wandering, unpredictable symptoms that resemble clouds. Children are most susceptible to this condition. Within a hundred days, it is referred to as a &quot;fetal tumor&quot; because their qi and blood are tender and weak, and their organs are soft and fragile, making them unsuitable for needles or knives, which is why caution is advised. </p>
<p>There are also nodules that develop between the neck and armpits, initially resembling the size of a bean or the pit of a plum, connected in clusters, sometimes numbering three to five, persisting without resolution, gradually enlarging or causing chills and fever, known as scrofula. Those with wind poison acquire it from wind, those with heat poison from heat, and those with qi poison from qi, all arising from the accumulation of pathogenic wind and heat. The symptoms vary, and the methods of treatment should also differ accordingly.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Between Good and Evil Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Concerning sores and ulcers, it is essential to discern between good and evil conditions, as they can reverse their natures. Traditionally, when treating sores, five good signs and seven bad signs are mentioned, but this specifically refers to the symptoms associated with the inner organs of the stomach and intestines. For conditions such as scalp or brain ulcers, there are distinct good and evil signs discussed later.</p>
<p>The seven bad signs are as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Irritability accompanied by coughing, severe thirst with abdominal pain, excessive diarrhea, or painful urination; this is the first evil sign.  </li>
<li>Discharge of pus and blood exacerbated by swelling and inflammation, with foul-smelling pus, and severe pain that prevents touch; this constitutes the second evil sign.  </li>
<li>Abnormal vision, including tight and small black pupils, and discoloration of the whites of the eyes; this is the third evil sign.  </li>
<li>Shortness of breath with labored breathing, accompanied by confusion and excessive sleepiness; this represents the fourth evil sign.  </li>
<li>Discomfort in the shoulders and back, leading to a feeling of heaviness in the limbs; this is the fifth evil sign.  </li>
<li>Inability to eat, vomiting after taking medicine, and lacking any taste in food; this is the sixth evil sign.  </li>
<li>A hoarse voice with a pale complexion, blue or red lips and nose, and swelling of the face and limbs; this constitutes the seventh evil sign.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When movement and rest are in harmony, and when food and drink are appreciated for their flavors, this is the first goodness; when convenience is adjusted and balanced, this is the second goodness; when pus dissipates and swelling subsides, and when water is fresh and odorless, this is the third goodness; when the spirit is vibrant and the voice is clear, this is the fourth goodness; when the body and energy are harmonious, this is the fifth goodness. </p>
<p>When illness manifests with the seven evils, the skin may feel tight and as if it is good; when illness manifests with the five goodnesses, and the skin feels soft and weak as if it is bad. Such conditions are not to be understood lightly. If one only knows that the five goodnesses come together, then goodness cannot increase; if the seven evils come together, one encounters the utmost of evil. </p>
<p>In my humble opinion, when suffering from sores and abscesses, if among the five goodnesses one suddenly sees one or two signs of goodness, the sore will also heal; within the seven evils, if one suddenly sees one or two signs of evil, it should be greatly feared. Generally, if the signs of sores and abscesses show signs of evil within a state of deficiency, they are incurable; true signs without evil will heal themselves. </p>
<p>After pus is discharged, if discomfort and pain are not yet healed, if the pulse is large, slippery, coarse, and scattered, it is difficult to treat; if it is weak, slow, and subtle, it is easier to heal. These signs of goodness and evil can also be discerned during diagnosis. </p>
<p>For boils on the back or the head and other serious sores, if there are distinct signs of the five reversals—such as white eyes, a dark and black face, small eyes, vomiting after taking medicine, intense pain and thirst, discomfort in the lower neck, hoarse voice and pale complexion—these are the five reversals. Other symptoms like heat, thirst, diarrhea, and vomiting indicate that toxins have invaded internally, and the damage to the organs should be treated according to the signs.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<p>In ancient times, the size of bian stones was determined according to the nature of the illness.

Nowadays, the use of the sickle comes from the &quot;Complete Collection of Sacred Cures,&quot; which mentions using the sickle to cut out blood. This must not be delayed. Moreover, Bian Que states that for ailments in the blood vessels, they should be treated with bian stones. This corresponds to the &quot;Suwen,&quot; which mentions that blood stagnation should be released. The &quot;Treatise on Qi and Blood&quot; also states that when one&#39;s form is joyous, yet the mind is troubled, ailments arise from within and should be treated with bian stones. Bian stones, said to originate from the East, were used by the people there, who often suffered from sores and ulcers; therefore, the method of using bian stones is appropriate. The use of bian stones is guided by specific symptoms, not limited to just tumors. When one sees swelling with a red color that fluctuates unpredictably, it is urgent to employ the sickle. First, apply raw oil to the red area before using the sickle, in order to drain the poison. However, this method must not be used lightly; one should avoid penetrating too deeply. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; teaches that when pricking the skin, the flesh should not be harmed. Each of the nine needles has specific indications. Although the bian-sickle method can treat sores and ulcers, it should still be used with caution.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

Those with weak powers may cause the weak to confront the strong; isn&#39;t that difficult? There are also inexperienced practitioners who do not understand the nature of disease; they recklessly apply cold medicines, chasing away evil toxins which then enter the body, returning to the heart and liver, resulting in death 80 to 90 percent of the time.

<p>For thick-skinned swellings, use soft cloth or paper with medicine applied and wait for it to dry before changing; for thin-skinned swellings, use loose gauze or thin paper with medicine applied, and it should be changed before the medicine dries. After suppuration occurs, apply warm ointments that promote tissue growth, aiming to expel foul odors, eliminate toxic fluids, remove necrotic tissue, and nurture healthy flesh, entirely relying on the power of warmth in the ointments.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Soaking and Immersion</strong></p>
<p>The method of soaking and immersion for sores and swellings promotes circulation on the surface, disperses evil qi, and facilitates internal resolution of the issue. Indeed, broth has the function of cleansing. The ancients said that if a sore or swelling arises and does not subside within a day or two, one must use broth to soak or spray it. For those located on the limbs, soak them; for those on the waist, abdomen, or back, spray them; and for those in the lower parts, immerse them. This is to open the pores and regulate the blood vessels, preventing stagnation. </p>
<p>For instance, use two taels of medicinal herbs and two liters of water, then boil to obtain one and a half liters. Using clean cloth or new cotton, dip it in the slightly warm medicinal water and soak the affected area, gradually spraying it. If it cools, promptly change it out; be careful not to use it cold. Blood and qi may congeal when exposed to cold and become stagnant without heat. Use this method five to seven times daily; for severe cases, continue day and night, sometimes ten or more times, until the swelling diminishes and pain subsides, thus confirming the effectiveness of this treatment for sores and swellings.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

<p>The diseases of sores and carbuncles have similar signs and symptoms. The method of needle cauterization is certainly not a trivial matter. There are shallow and deep forms, slow and fast responses, appropriate and inappropriate cases; this must be clearly distinguished. Carbuncles have thick skin and small openings, with more pus or fluid that does not drain quickly, thus needle cauterization is advisable. For superficial boils, only a needle should be used to pierce and drain the pus and blood; cauterization is not permitted. If there is no pus formed yet and one waits with various medicines applied to alleviate and soak, and after a long time it does not resolve, and internal suppuration occurs, one should abandon the medication and resort to needle cauterization. One should use a large needle similar to a fire poker, sharpened to a point, and rounded like a jujube pit. It should be heated with flame until it glows red, then dip it in oil to cauterize close to the base of the sore. If the cauterization is not thorough, it must be repeated until it is; the goal is to promote pus drainage without needing to press or squeeze. In recent times, good doctors, in urgent situations, use gold, silver, or iron rods that resemble needles, which can be universally utilized; this effectively releases the toxins. Alternatively, simply burning charcoal fiercely until it glows red, and then using it for cauterization while dipping in oil is particularly effective.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After cauterization, the actual condition should be treated with twisted hair as a ligature, while for the virtual condition, paper should be used as a ligature. Medicine is dipped on the ligature, and a warm, soft, sticky ointment is applied over it with cloth to keep it moist and prevent it from drying out. When sores and boils have formed, toxic heat gathers and attacks, eroding the epidermis and causing the flesh to rot. If not cauterized, the toxins cannot be resolved, and the pus cannot be discharged. If cauterization is delayed, it will turn inward, leading to internal decay; wishing for recovery in such conditions is futile. Alas! The method of cauterization is indeed the correct approach to treat this ailment. However, it should not be done too early, nor too late. I have seen unskilled practitioners who do not accurately assess the depth of the condition, rashly applying cauterization; either treating deep sores superficially, preventing the discharge of toxins, leading to internal pus; or treating shallow sores too deeply, harming healthy flesh and causing muscle and bone to rot. Sometimes they may irritate the area, causing more pain; or improperly needle in the wrong spot, causing issues elsewhere; or doing it when there is no pus, resulting in prolonged pain. This adds more suffering and damages true vitality. The cause of such outcomes is a failure to encounter a skilled physician.

<p>In the case of sores, it is advisable to use moxibustion rather than cauterization; for abscesses, cauterization is preferred over moxibustion. For red tumors and poisonous swellings, it is best to apply moist treatments. If the skin is smooth and soft, it should be pricked with a needle to release the toxins. The methods for treating sores are largely as described, with variations for specific circumstances. Therefore, the &quot;Sacred Remedies&quot; states: for recognizing sores, it is appropriate to apply moxibustion one or two hundred times, about the size of a mung bean. After moxibustion, if you feel a burning pain and it lasts a night, that is the fire energy penetrating deep into the swelling; the heat is directed by the fire and pushed out, hence this sensation. If the sore itches, it is advisable to place a bean curd cake over it for moxibustion. The cake should be made by mixing pepper, ginger, salt, and green onions, mashing them together into a cake with a thickness of about three coins. The moxibustion should be applied on top of the cake placed over the sore. If it feels too hot, lift it up and press it down again. It is better to change the cake frequently for a new one. If the sore is painful, it is crucial to apply moxibustion urgently, using a strong and ample number of treatments. If the pus has already formed, do not use moxibustion; instead, prick it open, and it will heal. For sores that have persisted for a long time and turned into fistulas, it is advisable to use the sulfur moxibustion method.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

Using a needle tip, pick up a little sulfur and apply it three to five times, allowing the pus to dry slightly as a measure. If the back hair starts to grow in, it is advisable to use the cake moxibustion method.

<p>You can take clean soil mixed with water and knead it into a cake one inch in diameter and two-tenths of an inch thick, placing it directly on the sore, using mugwort to make a stick for moxibustion. Replace the cake after each stick of moxibustion.

I recall some physicians who did not verify their treatment involving the larvae; they would take the larvae, cut off both ends, and place them on the sore, applying moxibustion, three times with each replacement, and all were effective. </p>
<p>Also, using the firefly larva for moxibustion has proven effective as noted in previous methods. This knowledge is often kept secret, so much so that it is rarely passed down even between fathers and sons. Another method involves crushing red-skinned garlic, shaping it into a cake similar to a fermented bean cake for moxibustion, which is also very effective.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Internal Dissipation Method</strong></p>
<p>Wounds and sores arise from the imbalance of yin and yang, causing the stagnation of nutrients and defensive Qi, leading to the obstruction of blood and energy flow. The ancients have said: &quot;When yang stagnates in yin, sores develop; when yin stagnates in yang, abscesses form.&quot; Sores and abscesses can originate both internally and externally. Internally, they emerge from the organs and the chest and abdomen, while externally, they appear on the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones, occurring in unpredictable places. The root cause of stagnation stems from the lack of blood and energy flow, whereby steam cannot disperse outward, leading to the accumulation of internal heat, hence the formation of sores and abscesses.</p>
<p>If one first perceives stagnation of Qi and blood, with the skin and flesh hardening and swelling without rupture, it is appropriate to disperse the wind-heat and open the meridians to facilitate internal dissipation. Gradually applying various herbal decoctions will thereby achieve internal resolution. Otherwise, if treatment is delayed, and the toxic heat does not dissipate, it can strike back internally, leading to the accumulation of pus and blood. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that in treating disease, one must seek the root cause. The underlying issue of sores and abscesses is the blockage of internal heat, also prompted by the accumulation of wind and cold. Thus, it is advisable to use warming and heating remedies to harmonize the blood, allowing for internal resolution.</p>
<p>Diagnosis follows certain principles; one must recognize that swelling with hardness and a white color indicates wind and cold, while redness and flair of swelling indicate heat and toxicity, highlighting their differences. If energy has already accumulated, one cannot apply methods for internal dissipation; rather, it is essential to utilize medications that drain pus and resolve inner dampness. These are matters of sequence and priority.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Method of Pursuing and Eroding</h3>
<p>Wounds and sores arise externally, primarily due to accumulated heat within. The Internal Classic states that when the blood is heated and the flesh decays, the protective and nourishing processes are impeded, leading to pus formation and decay. When a sore festers and begins to rot, yet the head is small and unbroken and the wound has not opened, or if toxic gases are not released and the pain is unbearable, we must establish the method of pursuing and eroding pus to allow toxins to escape instead of attacking internally, facilitating the removal of bad flesh and the growth of healthy tissue.</p>
<p>If the sore is constricted and the blood flows without stopping, one should not attempt to constrict it. Instead, apply the pursuing and eroding medicine to the sore and wait until it is ripe before attempting to close it. If the pain of the constricted sore affects the heart and root, one should also refrain from forcing it closed, for touching the sore will certainly exacerbate the pain, potentially leading to complications; caution is imperative.</p>
<p>If the pus and blood have formed but the sore has not yet broken, and a thin layer of skin has lifted, one should immediately use a breaking agent to secure it on top, applying ointment. After the pus emerges, use a medicine to extract pus and transform toxins; the effect will be remarkable. If the pus and blood have not been exhausted, using a medicine to promote flesh growth and contract the wound in hopes of quick healing is ill-advised; failing to eliminate bad tissue will lead to the wound closing prematurely but possibly recurring later, so one must exercise caution. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wounds, ulcers, boils, tumors, abscesses, and swellings, when first perceived, should be treated with methods to resolve them internally. If they persist for a long time and the vital energy and blood weaken, leading to cold muscles and flesh, with clear, thin pus, toxins remain inside, the wound edges do not close, and a lump forms that is not red, or a tuberculosis-like condition without pus, and the external symptoms are unclear, one should apply the method of &quot;tuo li&quot; (removing interior toxins). If pus has not yet formed, measures should be taken to hasten its formation. If pus has already suppurated, efforts should be made to promote the growth of new flesh. In cases of deficiency of blood and energy, &quot;tuo li&quot; should be used to replenish them. If Yin and Yang are in disharmony, &quot;tuo li&quot; should be used to harmonize them. Generally, the method of &quot;tuo li&quot; should ensure that wounds do not develop further complications. For any practitioner of wound treatment, it is essential to have &quot;tuo li&quot; medicine available every day. Nevertheless, one must carefully assess the urgency of cold, heat, warmth, or coolness, as well as symptoms like thirst, disturbance, nausea, and treat accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Relief Methods</strong></p>
<p>Conditions of wounds and ulcers vary; both cold and heat, deficiency and excess, can produce pain. Therefore, methods to alleviate pain are not limited to one approach. People often believe substances like milk and myrrh are precious remedies to relieve pain, unaware that different conditions require specific methods. Pain due to heat can be alleviated by using cold remedies to counteract the heat, thereby stopping the pain. Pain from cold pathogens can be alleviated by applying warm remedies to dispel the cold, thus relieving the pain. If pain is caused by wind, the wind should be dispelled; if from dampness, the dampness should be guided away. If pain arises from dryness, moisture should be added; if from obstruction, it should be unblocked; if from deficiency, it should be supplemented; if from excess, it should be purged. If pain is caused by trapped pus, it should be released; if unhealthy flesh is festering, it should be drawn out; if there’s disharmony between Yin and Yang, it should be balanced; if there are secret conditions in the meridians, they should be unblocked. Being able to adapt to circumstances is the mark of a superior physician; one must not cling to fixed methods without considering the context.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

<p>Ancient people used medicine according to the illness, tailoring treatments without rigid adherence to formulas, adjusting dosages based on the condition. For treating accumulations and providing nourishment, one could use pill form based on old formulas without modification. In critical situations with sores and abscesses, where symptoms are diverse, how could one adhere strictly to formulas? Indeed, adjustments can be made according to necessity. </p>
<p>For example, in cases of furuncular abscesses accompanied by headache due to deficiency before and after suppuration, add Schisandra to the medicine applied. If the patient is restless and disoriented, add ginseng and Poria. For deficiency with fever, include Rehmannia and the root of (wild) yam. In cases of alternating chills and heat, add Bupleurum and the bark of Lycium. If thirst persists, add Anemarrhena and red bean. For constipation, add rhubarb and Glauber&#39;s salt. For urinary retention, add muk and hemp grass. If marked fatigue occurs, add goji berries and asparagus. For diarrhea, add magnolia bark. If extremities are cold, include aconite and ginger. For nausea, add clove and patchouli. If there is excessive phlegm, add pinellia and aged tangerine peel. For abundant pus, add angelica and ligusticum. If pain is severe, add myrrh and frankincense. For delayed muscle growth, add white atractylodes and cinnamon. If there is wind evil, add ligusticum and saposhnikovia. For palpitations and anxiety, add cinnabar. If there is twitching of the mouth and eyes, add notopterygium and asarum. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Adaptation of Methods in Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The diseases of sores and boils require various treatment methods. In general, each has its suitability. There are tonics and purgatives, methods for washing and applying poultices, and techniques involving needles, knives, moxibustion, and cauterization, all of which differ in use. Those who understand the principles will definitely achieve effective treatments. Yet those who are ignorant of these principles may encounter disadvantages. I have seen instances of treating cold with heat, and heat with cold, which are common misunderstandings throughout history. Additionally, some inspect prescriptions and treat illnesses by arbitrarily adding or subtracting ingredients based on personal judgment, believing it to be right. However, they do not recognize that diseases can manifest in counterproductive ways, treatments may need to be careful or urgent, methods have their rightful authority, and prescriptions have their odd or even variations, with applications varying in intensity and weight. </p>
<p>Doctors must comprehend these principles; only with understanding can they adapt methods accordingly. Those who grasp the nuances can realize the principles and acknowledge the rationale behind them, thereby accessing the source of knowledge. While I may be less skilled, I will share a fragment of understanding. I have seen that treating cold with heat may result in worsening cold, and treating heat with cold may escalate the heat. Why is this so? It stems from an ignorance of the yin and yang qualities of the five organs, where one should treat like with like. For example, if the heart&#39;s heat is excessive, one should nourish the kidneys; the kidney&#39;s water will sufficiently replenish it, causing the heat to diminish. Conversely, if the kidneys are deficient and cold, one should supplement the heart&#39;s fire; once the heart fire increases, the cold will diminish. This is what is meant by treating cold with yin and treating heat with yang. </p>
<p>Moreover, using heat to treat cold and using cold to treat heat should ultimately align with the principles of yin and yang. I&#39;ve also heard that when treatments for minor issues go against the condition, more severe treatments may be in order. What does this mean? Treating cold with heat must proceed coolly, while treating heat with cold must be done gently. This aims for a harmonious balance.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

However, in the treatment of sores, regarding supplementary and purging methods, it is essential to understand the foundational principles of these correct and alternative approaches—how can one neglect this knowledge?</p>
<p>Generally, the critical method for treating sores and abscesses starts with recognizing the presence of heat and toxins, where fever and stagnation lead to the development of sores and abscesses. Within the first couple of days, one should first take the Five Benefits Decoction to eliminate evil qi, clear the internal organs, and facilitate internal resolution. </p>
<p>As for decoction methods from ancient to modern times, they suggest cutting the herbs into pieces the size of a soybean and rapidly boiling them over high heat, ensuring they do not become overcooked, as the aim is for fast effectiveness. Then, one employs pills and powders to guide the blood vessels, gradually dissolving the issues to promote a more gentle dispersal. </p>
<p>Additionally, one should use moistening and warming methods, while also employing medicated plasters and pastes to apply around the sores, in accordance with the principles of yin and yang.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On the Five Types of Boils</h3>
<p>The five types refer to boils and sores that arise on the head, back, eyebrows, beard, and temples. Generally speaking, they can be divided into three categories: the sore, the boil, and the pustule. </p>
<p>When a sore first appears, it is the size of a grain of millet, with distinct itching and pain. If one accidentally breaks it, it will spread and expand, becoming red and swollen, causing a deep, heavy sensation that pulls and pains the ribs. After several days, the skin becomes hot and thick, accompanied by chills and thirst. The swelling expands, and after several days without healing, it may lead to bleeding if suppressed. Those that arise on the back are called back sores. Those that arise on the head are known as cerebral sores. Those that appear on the temples and eyebrows are named accordingly. </p>
<p>There are also instances where a sore develops without a head, wide-ranging three to four inches, initially causing a feeling of pressure and pain. After a few days, the skin appears smooth and soft, and in severe cases, it can also induce fever, chills, headache, and thirst, which is termed a back boil. Moreover, if a sore appears with a head, red and floating without a root, measuring one to two inches between the skin, it is considered a pustule.</p>
<p>Among these three types, the sore is the most severe. All these ailments arise from indulgence in rich foods and excessive clothing. Thick clothing keeps one warm but makes it easy for cold to invade, while overindulgence in food generates heat within the five organs. Accumulated heat in the internal organs obstructs the flow of blood vessels, causing toxic substances to stagnate, with evil pathogens remaining in the body. Heat acts on the blood, leading to its clumping, and eventually causing the flesh to break down into sores—shallower ones become pustules, deeper ones become boils, and the deepest turn into sores.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are those who have developed this ailment after taking gold or stone medicines, and there are also those who have never taken such medicines yet suffer from the same disease. This is likely due to their ancestors having ingested such substances, causing toxic factors to be passed down to their descendants. When this illness first manifests as a sore, it should be treated promptly. For individuals with strong vital energy, they should urgently take Five-Spice Lianqiao Decoction or Loulu Decoction. For those under fifty years old who are robust and strong, they may take the Five-Li Dahuang Decoction or Detox Pills to promote the smooth functioning of the internal organs. On the sore itself, apply poison-coursing powders and warm, heated plasters. Additionally, use dispelling swelling decoction and purging toxin decoction to cleanse, and thus prepare for the maturation of pus. Initially, other medicines should not be used to treat, so as to soothe the patient&#39;s mind; one must be careful not to cause irritation. </p>
<p>Once the pus has formed and bursts, it is advisable to take the Five-Spice Decoction, as well as internal Litoran Powder, Polygala Decoction, or other similar formulas. For unquenchable thirst, one should use Bamboo Leaf and Astragalus Decoction or Frankincense Powder. Avoid taking strong purgatives like Dahuang or bitter cold medicines; if one takes excessive purgatives resulting in uncontrollable diarrhea, it could be fatal. If there are still necrotic tissues in the sore and the pus is not flowing freely, one should use cauterizing medicines or apply a mixture with deer antler powder to form a paste with vinegar. When the necrotic tissue recedes and healthy tissue begins to form, use pus-expelling powder or similar formulas. If the toxic energy within the sore has not yet dissipated, be cautious not to close it up too soon. If one were to use medicines to promote flesh regrowth too early, even if recovery occurs, there will likely be a recurrence. Adjustments and care should be tailored to the situation, while also being mindful of protective and cautionary measures.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　夫疮肿之患，莫大乎痈疽，然而痈疽何以别之？经所谓荣卫稽留于经脉之中则濇不行，血脉不行则阳气郁遏而不通，故生寒热秽毒之气，腾出于外，畜结为痈；久而不散，热气乘之，腐化为脓。然而骨髓不焦枯，腑脏不伤败，可治而愈也。何为疽？五脏风毒积热，毒热炽甚，下陷肌肤，骨髓皆枯，血气涸竭，其肿色夭，坚如牛领之皮，故命曰疽。痈者其肿皮薄以泽，此其候也。痈疽之生，有内有外，内生胸腹脏腑之中，外生肤肉筋骨之表。凡此二毒，发无定处而有常名。夫郁滞之本，始于喜怒忧乐不时，饮食居处不节，或金石草药之发动，寒暑燥湿之不调，内使阴阳之不平而蕴结，外使荣卫凝濇而腐溃。轻者起于六腑，浮达而为痈，气行经络而浮也；重者发于五脏，沉濇而为疽，气行经络而沉也。明乎二者，肿毒丹疹，可以类推矣。<a id="orig-100p" href="#trans-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The affliction of sores and swellings is most severe in the case of boils and carbuncles. However, how can we distinguish between them? The Classic states that when the nourishing and protective energies are obstructed within the meridians, they do not flow freely. When the blood vessels do not move, the yang energy becomes stagnant and does not circulate, resulting in the emergence of cold, heat, and toxic miasmas, which then manifest externally and accumulate to form boils. If these do not dissipate over time, the heat will invade, leading to necrosis and pus formation. Nevertheless, if the bone marrow is not scorched and the organs are not damaged, they can be treated and healed.</p>
<p>What, then, is a carbuncle? It occurs when the five organs are afflicted with wind, poison, and accumulated heat. The toxic heat descends and penetrates the skin, causing the bone marrow to dry up and the blood vitality to deplete, resulting in swelling that appears dark and hard like the skin of an ox’s neck, hence the name carbuncle. Boils, on the other hand, have a thinner, moister outer skin; this is their characteristic.</p>
<p>The emergence of boils and carbuncles can originate from both internal and external factors. Internally, they may arise in the organs of the chest and abdomen; externally, they manifest on the surface of the skin, muscles, and bones. These two types of toxins can appear anywhere and are defined by consistent names. The root of stagnation begins with the mismanagement of emotions like joy, anger, worry, and pleasure, as well as irregularities in diet and living conditions. It may also result from the activation of minerals, stones, or herbs, along with imbalances of cold, heat, dryness, and moisture, which lead to an internal disharmony of yin and yang and subsequently to an external stagnation of the nourishing and protective energies, causing decay.</p>
<p>In mild cases, the affliction starts in the six fu organs, rising to form a boil, as the energy flows superficially; in severe cases, it originates from the five zang organs, sinking to form a carbuncle, as the energy flows deeper. Understanding these two conditions allows for the extrapolation to other types of swellings, toxins, and rashes.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Boil and Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>Boils and carbuncles are named because their shape resembles that of a lid. According to ancient texts, there are generally ten kinds. Huayan describes five-colored boils, and the &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; mentions thirteen types of boils. This aligns with the &quot;Secret Essentials of External Treatments,&quot; which thoroughly discusses the subject. However, all these descriptions pertain to the accumulation of pathogenic qi in the meridians and internal organs, resulting in hidden toxic heat. Initially, there is swelling and pain, with colors varying between blue, yellow, red, and black, leading to agitation and discomfort. Symptoms may include aversion to cold, headache, or nausea. If the boil is pricked with a needle but yields no pain or blood, this is a relevant sign. </p>
<p>This condition is primarily due to excessive rich and fatty foods and careless indulgence with alcohol, resulting in an accumulation of harmful toxins that leads to the formation of boils. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the change from rich foods gives rise to significant boils. The treatment method is to hastily apply moxibustion with mugwort sticks. If the boil does not hurt when pricked and does not produce blood, heat the needle until it is red and cauterize the boil, turning it to char; pain is considered a desired effect. Additionally, treat the previous location with ointment, and take herbal decoctions like Wuxiang Lianqiao soup or Loulu soup to promote a thorough resolution. </p>
<p>If there is no pain when pricked, and if the person experiences darkening vision or sees lights, do not treat them. This indicates that toxic qi has entered the internal organs. The &quot;Health Preservation Prescriptions&quot; states: if a person sweats into their flesh and then consumes it, they may develop boils. Caution is advised.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Abscess, Carbuncles, and Toxic Conditions</strong></p>
<p>To disperse various toxins, grind white hibiscus leaves and mix them with a small amount of Aconitum leaves and honey for application. For severe cases, add powdered southern star. For any toxic conditions that cause thirst, or excessive pus, prevent further thirst; it is advisable to use the Qianjin Neibu San alongside Bawei Wan, with the five-flavor ones being preferable. In cases of fever and chills resembling typhoid but with pain, the painful spots may become abscesses. An abscess is related to the intestines and grows superficially, with thin skin and swelling; a carbuncle is related to the organs, hence it grows deep, with thick skin and hard swelling. A milder condition than these is called a boil. An abscess indicates stagnation, a carbuncle indicates blockage, and a boil represents a nodular condition, suggesting stagnation of qi and blood. One may also use Wei Ling Xian Yin for slight benefits, or Wu Xiang Lian Qiao San, supplemented by Fu Yuan Tong Qi San. If pus and blood coalesce and do not disperse, whether already ruptured or not, it is advisable to use Xiao Tuo Li San, or Qianjin Neibu San, with the addition of equal parts Mu Xiang, Qiang Huo, Bai Shao Yao, and Wu Yao; for thirst, add the root of (艹舌) Lou. All these medicines treat Yang conditions.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For conditions characterized by excess yin, it is advisable to use a remedy from the &quot;Thousand Golds&quot; that supplements and disperses, reducing half of the quantities of Fangfeng and Jie geng, while doubling the amount of Baizhu. If there is no effect, add more Shufu and cook with other herbs for better results. </p>
<p>If external remedies such as gold and stone are used to assist with desires, and the essential energy has already waned, the toxic effects may overpower; since gold and stone are similar to the lungs, which are connected to the kidneys, it often leads to the disease of developing back issues. There is also the use of tortoise for external application, which also treats back problems; the yang energy of the tortoise is concentrated in its upper shell, so the upper shell can be used as medicine. The treatment method remains the same. If toxicity arises in the yin, yet it is not suitable to use medications like Fu or Gui, and there is exterior pain with internal cold, it is advisable to use a Wuxiang Decoction. </p>
<p>At the early stages of toxin emergence, it is recommended to use wine to adjust and restore the flow of qi. If the illness is located in the lower parts, apply a wine paste pill to restore qi and swallow it down with a Muxiang Decoction. </p>
<p>For treating various formed toxins, a paste made from the fruits of the soapberry tree, ground with black vinegar and applied topically is beneficial. These fruits should be stored in a smoke-proof box for convenient usage in times of need. </p>
<p>For those suffering from back sores, or if various toxins have already erupted and there is excessive blood loss and insufficient body fluids, it is necessary to change the skin and dispel toxins.

Generally, when diabetes leads to toxicity after recovery, and the toxicity returns to cause diabetes, these are considered untreatable conditions.</p>
<p>Boils and carbuncles are general terms for various toxic manifestations, each with different symptoms and names. Before they rupture, there may be chills, intense heat, delirium, and visions as if encountering ghosts or spirits. If there is significant pus discharge along with persistent high fever, it is likely difficult to treat. The presence of pus due to toxicity parallels the sweating seen in cold illnesses; if sweating occurs followed by a resurgence of high fever, it indicates a severe cold injury. For external treatment, washing and applying dressings are appropriate. If a boil or carbuncle on the back has ruptured with excessive pus and signs of emaciation, the formula for Xiong Gui Tang should be used. In all medications administered, white atractylodes must be avoided, as it can promote pus formation. However, it can be used for unruptured or initial cases.</p>
<p>If the person experiences vomiting and has little appetite, the Qianjin Neibu San should not be used, as it can stagnate the spleen and may carry external pathogens.

In cases of purulent boils where the blood has already suppurated excessively, leading to depletion of fluids and severe thirst, along with symptoms of fever and agitation, one cannot treat with ordinary measures, but should use tonics that nourish and generate fluids. If there is severe and unceasing heat, treatment becomes difficult. For chronic sores that do not dry up and leak, regularly consuming honeysuckle grass soaked in wine is advised.

<p><strong>General Discussion on Medicinal Use</strong></p>
<p>Illnesses in individuals vary, and medicinal properties also differ. There are appropriate medicines for each condition that must not be misapplied. For instance, in cases of sores or abscesses where pain subsides, appetite returns, and both pulse and symptoms are gentle, the focus should be on the root cause; therefore, using gentle and harmonious medicines allows for gradual treatment and generally leads to healing. However, if the pulse is deep and tight, accompanied by swelling, chills, fever, and restlessness, this indicates a solid pulse condition that requires purging. Only strong purgatives can resolve such conditions, while using gentle remedies here would be inappropriate. Conversely, if sores are swollen but not yet suppurating, or if there is a clear, watery discharge, or if there are severe diarrhea and an inability to eat, with potential vomiting at any time or coldness in the hands and feet, this reflects a weak pulse condition that cannot be balanced without significant tonics. Here, employing aggressive purging medications would also be inappropriate.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When addressing the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; consider that what is deficient should be supplemented, what is excessive should be drained, what is hot should be cleared, and what is cold should be warmed. Follow the principles of diagnosis and adapt treatments accordingly to avoid errors. Generally, the signs of sores and ulcers arise from disharmony in the organs, stagnation of qi and blood, irregular emotions, unregulated diet, or improper skin and muscle defenses, allowing pathogenic influences to invade the meridians. Additionally, the use of mineral medications, indulgence in rich foods, and neglecting intimate life can lead to deficiency of essence and depletion of qi. Therefore, when treating the symptoms, one must discern the internal and external conditions of deficiency and excess, and treat accordingly. If one does not consider the principles of yin and yang, the dynamics of qi and substance, and hastily prescribes medicines, it may lead to a confusion of treatments for deficiency and excess. Furthermore, adhering rigidly to the “royal way” of treatment without adapting can be harmful. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the formation of sores and carbuncles, regardless of their deficiency or excess, cold or heat, arises from stagnation of qi. It also mentions that when qi is trapped in the meridians, it becomes thick with blood and stagnates, resulting from emotional disturbances like joy, anger, worry, and thought. Additionally, if the body has heat and is struck by wind-cold, the stagnation of blood and vessels can lead to blockage and heat accumulation, among other factors.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is an imbalance of Yin deficiency and Yang energy, causing cold to transform into heat. When heat accumulates, meat decays into pus; this is due to injury from cold, heat, wind, and heat. Some cases arise from applying heated substances excessively on damp bedding, while others result from overexertion in sexual activities that deplete essential energy. &quot;Erya&quot; states: a boil is a festering sore, a carbuncle is a blockage, and an ulcer is an obstruction. This means that the disharmony of Yin and Yang leads to stagnation and eventually results in carbuncles and ulcers. Furthermore, it states that when Yin stagnates in Yang, boils occur; when Yang stagnates in Yin, ulcers arise. These two types of toxins do not have a fixed location and should be discerned through pulse diagnosis. A floating, rapid pulse indicates Yang, while a weak, sinking pulse indicates Yin. Heat should be treated with cooling methods, and cold should be treated with warming methods. There are four stages and eight considerations in treatment. Initially, one should reduce heat and eliminate toxins; once an abscess has formed, one should drain pus and alleviate pain. If pus is present, necrotic tissue should be removed, and once it is completely excised, a scab can be allowed to form. After understanding the stages, one must also identify the causes for targeted treatment, observing the severity and prognosis of the illness.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

<p>A guest asked about the pulse being rapid and forceful in cases of sores, along with a feeling of heat in the body, which indicates a yang condition, and whether there could also be death in such cases. The response was: The classics say that if yin stagnates in yang, it leads to carbuncles, with the pulse appearing deep, thin, weak, and slippery; if yang stagnates in yin, it leads to ulcers, with the pulse appearing superficial, rapid, and string-like. This pertains to the differentiation of conditions based on qi and blood, classifying sores and ulcers as belonging to either yin or yang. </p>
<p>Although such sores and ulcers may arise from accumulated heat, if they are newly formed and not yet discharging pus, a rapid and forceful pulse indicates a deficiency in yin and an excess in yang. If pus forms internally and cannot be released externally, the body will definitely show a rise in temperature; thus, the rapid and forceful pulse indicates a progression of the condition regarding sores and ulcers. Once the pus is discharged, the pulse should become calm, the body cool, the swelling should diminish, and the pain should cease, similar to a recovery from the exterior manifestations of cold damage upon sweating. If, however, there is a return of fever with thirst and a rapid and forceful pulse, this indicates a true qi deficiency with an excess of pathogenic qi, leading to certain death without doubt.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

If the pulse is floating and large, one must first support the internal organs to prevent evildoers from entering. When there are influences from both internal and external sources, if the evil qi becomes excessive, it obstructs the meridians, leading to bumps and swellings. This results from failures in supporting the internal organs, achieving smooth communication, and harmonizing the defensive and nutritive qi. </p>
<p>The key to treating ulcers must clarify the three methods of supporting the internal organs, ensuring smooth communication, and harmonizing the defensive and nutritive qi. For issues that are external in nature, if the pulse is deep and firm, with fever and irritability, lacking external redness, and pain felt deeply within, the evil qi is severe; one should clear the internal organs to cut off the source. For problems that are internal but display externally, if the pulse is floating and rapid, with swelling on the surface, and the symptoms are obvious, there is a concern that the evil qi is extreme and may penetrate inward, thus one must first support the internal organs. In cases that are mixed, where there are no evil qi symptoms on the surface and the internal organs are functioning smoothly, it can be recognized that the balance in the meridians must be harmonized with the defensive and nutritive qi.</p>
<p>After applying these three methods, even if the situation isn&#39;t perfect, there should be no significant changes in symptoms. This approach can significantly reduce the evil qi and facilitate recovery.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Moxibustion Method</h3>
<p>The &quot;Yuan Rong&quot; states: Sores and ulcers that enter from the outside should not be moxibustioned, while those that arise from the inside should be moxibustioned. External entry should be removed without entering inside, while internal emergence should be connected to allow for outward passage. Therefore, the classics say: &quot;For those that are sunken, moxibustion is needed.&quot; If there is no pain during moxibustion, one should stop only after the pain begins. The reason there is no pain during moxibustion is because one first treats the area that is not yet ruptured, causing a lack of sensation, and then addresses the healthy flesh, which causes discomfort.</p>
<p>If there is pain during moxibustion, one should stop only after the pain subsides. The pain indicates the treatment is applied to the area that has not yet ruptured, while the subsequent area that is about to rupture does not cause pain. However, this is merely a general guideline; along with the methods from &quot;East Wall&quot; and others, it is advisable to reference them. When a person first feels the back swelling, which is red, hot, and painful, one should first cover the area with a wet paper and watch. The part of the paper that dries first indicates where the abscess is forming. </p>
<p>Take garlic sliced to thickness of two to three qian, place it on top of the swelling, and moxibustion with a large moxa stick for three rounds. Then replace with another slice of garlic, moxibustion until the pain ceases or, if there is no pain, until pain emerges, at which point one should stop. The key is to recognize the condition early and start moxibustion right away. </p>
<p>If treated within one or two days, it remains highly effective; within three or four days, it is moderately effective; within five or six days, it is less effective; but after seven days, moxibustion should not be performed. If there are ten or more locations forming abscesses at the same spot, mash garlic into a paste, spread it into a thin pancake and place it on the area, burning moxa on top of the garlic pancake can also be effective.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: It is said that for the emergence of furuncles and abscesses, moxibustion is advisable. However, for sores that have long been festering and continuously produce non-foul pus without any rotten flesh, it is particularly beneficial to use aconite, thoroughly soaked, cut into pieces about three to two-tenths of an inch thick, and applied to the sore, followed by moxibustion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Method of Attack and Supplement</h3>
<p>The &quot;Yuan Rong&quot; states: When the pulse is trapped, it signifies a fistula, where flesh is entangled, leading to the blockage of vital energy, which then turns backwards against the flesh&#39;s structure and results in abscesses and swellings. If the nourishing energy is stagnant and the blood is prolonged, heat gathers into pus. The &quot;Zheng Li Lun&quot; states: Where heat flows, there are abscesses and swellings. Is it possible for nourishing energy to not follow, yet still not be hot? The answer is: The transformation of rich foods, the beauty of fragrant herbs, the excess of metals and stones, causes the energy and blood to not flourish, while the protective and nourishing energies become full but are restrained and unable to move, thereby blocking the blood and energy which then decays and turns into an abscess; it should be dispelled to remove the accumulated heat. If a person has a sparse diet, weak spirit, deficient energy and blood, with thin and emaciated muscles, the protective and nourishing energies short and stagnant, resulting in cold and thin structures that are closed and obstructed leading to abscesses and swellings; thus, they should be supplemented to connect with the weak and cowardly energy. The distinctions in the pulse, whether floating or sinking, should also be recognized. Once the excess and deficiency are understood, dispelling can be achieved using substances like Forsythia and Rhubarb, while supplementation can be approached with internal tonics. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The differentiation of sores caused by heat or cold, and the blockage caused by stagnant energy and blood, necessitates different methods of attack and supplementation, which should be compared with previous and subsequent texts for a comprehensive understanding. However, the common understanding in society often misses this principle, claiming certain conditions are sores while incorrectly administering Five Spice Forsythia Decoction. This leads to mixed outcomes due to a lack of discernment in the deficiency or excess of form and energy, as well as the depth of sores and toxins, and the differing causes of treatments for external vs. internal issues. Therefore, regarding the teachings of Master Danxi in &quot;Essentials of External Medicine,&quot; the principles outlined should be appended for the learners&#39; reference.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Three Causes</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze states: Those who develop abscesses are affected by three causes. It is stated: Abscesses, boils, and scrofula arise from stagnation of qi, regardless of whether they are caused by deficiency or excess, cold or heat. The classics also say: Qi, stagnating in the meridians and congealing with blood, fails to circulate and leads to abscess formation. It does not specify that heat must be present for an abscess to form; this arises from internal factors such as pent-up emotions of joy, anger, worry, or thought. When the body has heat and is struck by wind and cold, the blood vessels become stagnant and fail to circulate, leading to the blockage of heat gases that results in abscesses. Additionally, when a deficiency of yin allows yang qi to attack, or cold transforms into heat, excessive heat can cause flesh to decay and turn into pus. This too is an external cause caused by cold, heat, wind, and dampness. Furthermore, cases resulting from the intake of dan stone and consuming roasted wine, as well as excessive efforts in intimate activities leading to depletion of essence and qi, arise from internal and external injuries, thus indicating the presence of all three causes. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the division of the three causes is comprehensive, if the pathogens of sores and abscesses are not present, and if there are distinctions in the different layers (surface and interior), then the treatment cannot be exhaustively detailed.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When yin stagnates in yang, it creates carbuncles; when yang stagnates in yin, it creates sores. </p>
<p>Danxi said: &quot;The Essentials state that when yang is stagnant in yin, the pulse is floating, surging, and rapid; when yin is stagnant in yang, the pulse is deep, thin, weak, and hesitant. Yang stagnation is treated with cold, while yin stagnation is treated with heat. To understand this more deeply, the stagnation of yang in yin should be treated with heat, and the stagnation of yin in yang should be treated with cold. </p>
<p>When searching through cold and heat, it can indeed be analyzed as a theory of yin and yang; regarding yin and yang, it is distinctly related to qi and blood, with nothing more to be said. If heat stagnates in qi, can there be no cold stagnation? If cold stagnates in blood, can there be no heat stagnation? Why can cold not harm qi, and heat not harm blood? </p>
<p>From my observation, qi is yang, operating in the exterior of the pulse; blood is yin, moving in the interior of the pulse. Together, they circulate and flow without interruption, creating what we call the pulse. With each exhalation, the pulse moves three inches, and with each inhalation, it also moves three inches. The rhythm of breathing continuously amounts to six inches, circulating throughout the entire body, which is 81 zhang (a unit of length). When heat is present, movement is quick and excessive; when cold is present, movement is slow and inadequate.&quot;<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The richness of flavors, the skewness of emotions, the stagnation of qi leads to thick fluids that accumulate over time, becoming either drink or phlegm, seeping into the meridians, causing chaos in the blood, resulting in turbidity, and then either causing boiling or coldness. This is the stagnation of yin in yang, and the proper blood stagnating in qi. Regarding qi-related illnesses, people today may assist the pathogenic influence with medication, leading to the emergence of new diseases, causing blood-related issues to increase daily, overflowing outside the meridians, obstructing pathways, hindering ascension and descent, and disrupting normal transformation—a case of yang stagnating in yin, and proper qi stagnating in blood. When distinguishing between cold and heat diseases, it is essential to consider the inherent predispositions and the mixtures of deficiencies and pathogenic factors. Can we simply equate yin with cold and yang with heat? The floating, rapid, and wiry pulse indicates qi-related illness. Should we hastily label this as a heat condition? The deep, thin, and weak pulse points to blood-related illness. Should we then hastily label this as a cold condition? This is the root of countless diseases; it is not limited to just scabies, sores, carbuncles, or abscesses.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Principles of Vital Energy</strong></p>
<p>Dongyuan states: The theory of vital energy communicating with heaven indicates that when the nourishing energy is obstructed, it goes against the principles of the flesh, leading to the formation of boils and swellings. It also mentions that a diet rich in fatty and fine foods can cause serious sores and ailments like a false void. The theory of yin and yang influence states that the moist conditions of the earth negatively affect a person&#39;s skin, flesh, and muscles. This means that external dampness causes the nourishing energy to stagnate, and both the protective and nourishing energies are governed by this vital energy. The nourishing energy is derived from the stomach and is essential for circulation. When this energy is obstructed and adversely affected by dampness, it results in sores and ulcerations. The issue of excessive richness and flavor in food refers to how it causes the nourishing energy to flow in reverse, accumulating in the meridians and leading to sores and ulcers. This pathogenic factor is neither external nor internal, but exists primarily as a disease within the meridians. The aforementioned statements from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; highlight that conditions arise from the obstruction of vital energy. A comprehensive examination of various discussions on sores and ulcers reveals many references to the interplay of two types of heat, the transformation of heat into pus, as well as instances where heat transforms into pus due to moisture, or cold transforms into heat resulting in pus; these all represent the root causes of sores and carbuncles.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the observed parts, it is appropriate to use medicinal references, and also consider the division of yin and yang in the diagnosis. First, drain the nutritive qi, as this is foundational. When the vital energy is reversed, it assists the fire; when dampness and heat combine, they damage the muscles and lead to pus and blood, which is secondary treatment. It is necessary to obtain various items for comparison. During the year, the extreme heat does not exceed summer; at that time, all things do not rot, but spoil when autumn dampness greatly prevails. </p>
<p>Taking close observations of the body, when the hot disease manifests, it shows evident heat without damaging the muscles, which makes this principle clear. Without identifying the root and symptoms, evil qi cannot be eliminated. To understand one thing and know a hundred indicates a skilled practitioner. </p>
<p>When the nutritive qi does not flow and reverses in the muscle structure, ulcers and abscesses arise. The nutritive qi is related to stomach qi. When food enters the stomach, it is first transported to the spleen and then directed to the lungs. The lungs connect to all the meridians, subsequently affecting the skin and hair, first flowing through the yang pathways, then returning to the five organs and six bowls, thus forming the qi in fine increments. </p>
<p>Now, wealthy individuals do not comprehend their moderation, consuming rich and fatty foods mixed with strong flavors. Over time, these overly rich items, being the essence of yang, cannot move through the empty orifices and instead flow through the yin pathways, reversing the muscle structure. This leads to an overwhelming presence of dampness, causing the offspring to thrive at the expense of the mother, with fire becoming excessively vigorous. When damp heat is rampant, it must eventually attack the kidneys. If mixed with improper elements, it further undermines the true water. When the kidneys suffer from evil influences over time, the water becomes scarce; lacking water then leads damp heat to rise, causing ulcers to appear on the back and head, which represents the most severe form of large sores.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the poisonous gas travels through the lungs or the spleen and stomach, that is the next effect of the poison. If it emerges from other channels, that is secondary. The poison of dampness and heat causes ulceration wherever it settles. Hence, the classics say: the transformation of rich food can lead to severe boils; it is as if holding a vessel in a void. Just as a container receives things, it cannot resist absorbing everything. </p>
<p>To treat severe boils, one must certainly drain the vital energy. From the perspective of root and branch, the initial condition of the illness is the root; if not treated with bitter and cold medications as the primary remedy, it cannot eliminate the suffering and pain. Most sores and ulcers are painful, often treated with frankincense and myrrh mixed with aromatic medicines to relieve this pain; however, this will not necessarily lessen it. </p>
<p>If the meridians are unobstructed and flow through the organs, removing stagnation, there should be no pain. Bitter and cold drugs may alleviate the pain; when the medicine is swallowed, the pain will immediately cease; this is the supreme medicinal remedy. </p>

For sores and other illnesses that cause a red face, even if there is latent heat, one must not force anything internally, as this causes the yang energy to become stagnant and allows the evil energy to remain in the channels. It is appropriate to promote sweating to expel it. Hence, it is said that stagnant fire must be released. Even if there hasn’t been a bowel movement for several days, one should focus on promoting yang energy, adding some moistening herbs to alleviate dryness. If one observes symptoms of wind pulse, only wind-expelling herbs should be used; this will help facilitate bowel movements. If only dryness is present, it is particularly important to moisten it and one must be cautious not to induce a purge. When sores and abscesses occur, commonly referred to as confusion, it is advisable to induce sweating for recovery. Treat the sores by their names and colors, according to &quot;Suwen&quot; and &quot;Zhenjing.&quot; The &quot;Shengji Zonglu&quot; contains details on various sores and their colors, but its prescriptions tend to focus on cold and cooling methods, lacking the transformative techniques. However, those like Yi Lao and Dongyuan emphasize important principles from &quot;Zhenjing,&quot; outlining key examples of pulse diagnosis and treatment. Scholars who are familiar with such discussions will be clear and confident when prescribing at the point of care.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Abscesses</h3>
<p>The conditions of boils, sores, and pustules arise from stagnation of qi and blood; therefore, one must assess their conditions of deficiency and excess, exterior and interior, and treat them promptly. If one can dissolve the issue internally, this aligns with the principle of &quot;expelling toxins.&quot; However, if the toxic energies have already consolidated, one should not rely solely on internal resolution; instead, one must distinguish between the presence or absence of pus and its depth. If pressure causes a recurrence, there is pus; if it does not, there is none. If pressing deeply causes pain, the pus is deep; if only light pressure causes pain, the pus is superficial. Immediate and careful judgment on whether to puncture is critical. If handled too slowly, it may penetrate the organs and damage muscles and bones—a caution not to be taken lightly! </p>
<p>Nevertheless, patients often prefer internal resolution, while doctors may resort to remedies like Shixuan Powder, Baiduxing Powder, or Liuqi Decoction. They are unaware that, though Shixuan Powder contains ginseng and astragalus, the other ingredients—fengming, angelica, magnolia, and balloon flower—are all depleting of qi. This is especially true when one indiscriminately uses them without consideration for the specific meridians, seasonal factors, or the quantity of qi and blood. Baiduxing Powder is a remedy for dispersing exterior conditions; even if there are exterior symptoms, it is only effective in one or two doses, and to use it when no exterior symptoms are present is inappropriate. Liuqi Decoction is designed to move qi and disperse blood, but if taken excessively, it can lead to deficiency of qi and depletion of blood. How can one then produce pus? Therefore, these three medicines should not be used lightly.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a wound has already formed pus, and the skin cannot expel it, the unknowing may wait for it to burst on its own, not realizing that the young and robust may resolve it themselves; however, in the case of the elderly or weak, with depleted Qi and blood, and if there is excessive heat attacking, without puncturing, the toxic pus may invade and damage the intestines and membranes, rarely without causing problems. For instance, in the case of the Shen family, with a milk abscess that had formed pus, I punctured it in time, and it healed within a month. For Huang Shang&#39;s leg abscess, where the pus was ripe but he was afraid of the needle, he almost reached a critical state; I punctured it, and he recovered after three months of substantial nourishment. Lian Qianbing had a leg abscess where both pulse and signs were weak; it was perilous, but I treated it by allowing the pus to be brought out and urgently used a needle; he refused, leading the pus-water to open and leak, and he could not recover and ultimately perished. Wang An&#39;s skin infection waited for it to burst, but the toxic gas attacked internally; Wang Gui&#39;s abdominal abscess burst through the belly and side, with foul gas escaping from the wound; I told him it would not heal on its own, and indeed, it did not. In general, the symptoms of sores and ulcers have their degrees of severity and depth; superficial ones are swollen and soft, arising from the blood vessels; deeper ones are hard and swollen, arising from the tendons and bones. Yet there are cases that arise from the marrow, where the flesh remains unchanged; when pus forms, those with strong Qi and blood may expel it on their own, while the weak may not be able to tolerate puncturing, with rare exceptions. Dong Yuan said: if the toxic gas cannot be resolved externally, and the pus cannot be expelled, if timely intervention is neglected, it will attack internally. Once internal decay occurs, how can one hope for recovery?

<p>Muscles are governed by the spleen. The speed of healing after a wound closes is determined by the rise and fall of qi and blood. Practitioners today may only know to use substances like dragon’s blood and myrrh for promoting flesh growth and substances like乳 (milk) and myrrh for alleviating pain, adhering strictly to these methods. I argue otherwise. The proper method for promoting flesh growth should first focus on regulating the spleen and stomach to support qi and blood, allowing the muscles to regenerate naturally, thus not requiring substances like dragon’s blood. If purulent toxins remain and one uses methods to promote flesh growth, it could worsen the condition. For robust individuals, the situation may only lead to a recurrence of the wound or slow closure; but for the weak, a serious condition could lead to internal issues or an inability for the wound to close, which is perilous.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

By doing this, the pain will naturally cease; do we really need the likes of myrrh or frankincense? For instance, when Huang Ruyun&#39;s back developed toxic gas that had not yet dissipated, early application of flesh-regenerating medicine led to ulceration; I treated it with detoxifying drugs, and he recovered. Xu Xuban suffered from this when the toxic gas first emerged; with the sudden use of flesh-regenerating remedies, the poison attacked internally and resulted in death. Wang Rudaol had a painful leg abscess caused by cold; I gave him pain-relieving pills with myrrh. Zhou Zhaoyi&#39;s mother suffered from temporal toxicity, which caused pain due to heat; I prescribed Fangfeng Tongseng Powder. Ding Lan had a buttock abscess that burst, causing pain due to deficiency; I provided Yiqi Yangrong Decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Bad Flesh</strong></p>
<p>Bad flesh refers to decayed meat. Generally, when there are tumors, abscesses, or wounds, bad flesh must be removed to make way for new growth. If a person is robust with strong muscles and sufficient vital energy and blood, they can truly overcome evil; in some cases, the issue resolves itself or stabilizes without causing harm. However, for older or weaker individuals, with less blood and weak muscles, bad flesh must be actively removed and taken away to bring order and lead to peace. If it is left untreated, there is a risk of rotting flesh and decayed muscles. For example, Liu Dayin and Madame Wang had their bad flesh removed in time, allowing new flesh to grow, leading to full recovery. Conversely, Jin Gongbu and Lu Sheren had their bad flesh removed too late, approaching the point of no return. Zheng Huishi failed to remove it in time, leading to decay and death. I have frequently observed that once bad flesh is removed, even those who are young and robust do not fully restore their vital energy and blood, while those who are weak and do not remove the bad flesh or replenish their energy and blood rarely survive.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Moxibustion and Medicinal Methods</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials&quot; says: The classics state that all pain, itching, sores, and ulcers are related to heart fire. Predecessors also state that boils and carbuncles often arise in laborers exposed to Danstone. Anyone over forty who develops sores on the back should be treated promptly to prevent harm, as this condition is akin to a tiger entering the house—if not handled well, it will cause injury. One should first use the internal dispersing powder, then administer the Lianqiao Wuxiang Decoction, followed by the &quot;Horse Riding on Bamboo&quot; method or moxibustion with garlic separated, as well as moxibustion at Zu San Li to release the poison. Where evil gathers, the Qi must be deficient. If it lingers and does not leave, the illness becomes solid. Therefore, if boils and carbuncles have not yet ruptured, the organs contain toxins; any hot medications must not be used. If they have ruptured, and the organs are already depleted, then even a small amount of cold medicine must also be avoided. Additionally, it is advisable to refrain from using topical medications that would block the pores.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a></p></div>

<p>Initially, regarding the emergence of sores and boils, one must urgently use strong laxatives such as rhubarb, without concern for discomfort. If one must choose between allowing them to fester and die or to purge them and die, it is better to purge; moreover, there is the possibility of recovery! In ancient times, treatments typically invoked five spices, forsythia, and reed, and for the impoverished, a simple decoction of rhubarb was prepared to relieve them. Once pus begins to form, one should take astragalus and similar herbs to expel the pus, as outlined in the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; and &quot;External Treatments.&quot; Many have succumbed to sores on the exterior without purging. Alas! </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to previous evidence, if the swelling is high and painful, with internal organs congested, one should use the aforementioned medications to purge. If there is mild swelling with slight pain, and the organs are not congested, one should use internal tonics for support.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is swelling without a head and the color of the flesh does not change, one should aid the stomach to strengthen its energy, allowing for internal resolution. If the pain persists and the swelling does not subside, one should use a ginseng and astragalus powder to release the abscess and expel pus. If appetite is poor and muscles do not develop, one should use a ginseng and astragalus powder to nourish and support the spleen and stomach. Danxi states that abscesses arise from accumulated toxins in the organs; one must first strengthen the stomach’s energy to solidify the foundation, and then use blood-moving medications as an adjunct, allowing the toxins to escape through the meridians in a timely manner, which can lead to internal resolution. This is the principle of internal expulsion. Furthermore, he says: if there is swelling and abscess both internally and externally, one should primarily use exterior dispersing medicines. If rhubarb is employed, could it not lack caution? In cases where both the internal and external are weakened, one should focus on nourishment and reinforcement; using fragrant powders could undoubtedly lead to a loss of vital essence.

<p>Chen Wuze said: In cases of abscess, the skin is thin and the swelling is high; in cases of ulcers, the skin is thick and the swelling is firm. Initially, both should be treated with moxibustion. However, when the pus of an abscess has formed, needling is appropriate, while when the pus of an ulcer has formed, cauterization is advisable. One must carefully examine the symptoms, alleviate the toxins, and nourish the internal organs. However, abscesses and ulcers rank at the top of various diseases, and improper treatment order often leads to dire consequences. Therefore, I have compiled effective moxibustion methods to benefit scholars, so that they do not mistakenly apply treatments.</p>
<p>[Note: In cases where there are symptoms like fever, thirst, and constipation, it indicates that pathogens are accumulating within. The internal toxin should be evacuated using Huanglian Decoction. If there is headache, rigidity, fever, and aversion to cold, this suggests an external pathogenic invasion, and Ren Shen Bai Du San should be used to disperse the exterior pathogens. If there is swelling, pain, heat, and thirst, this indicates that toxic energy is trapped in the flesh, and Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin should be used to disperse the toxins. If there is decreased appetite, fatigue, fever, and aversion to cold, this suggests weak spleen qi, and Liu Jun Zi Tang should be used to nourish the spleen and stomach.]<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Fifth Method of Garlic Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>Li says: The method for treating sores relies more on moxibustion than on medicine. It is essential to allow the toxic qi to escape, akin to a thief entering a house; one must open the door to chase them away, or else they will cause harm within. For sores that have just begun, within one or two days, one should use large cloves of garlic, slicing them three-tenths of an inch thick, and apply them directly on the sore. Moxibustion with mugwort should then be performed, alternating the garlic every three applications. If it causes pain, moxibustion should be conducted until the pain subsides; if there is no pain, it should be administered to induce discomfort. When the sore has ruptured, apply the miraculous ointment. By doing so, the sore will not enlarge, the flesh will not decay, and the wound will heal more swiftly, achieving three benefits in one act. This method&#39;s effectiveness is rarely known. However, if the head or neck shows signs of sores, this method should not be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regarding the symptoms of sores, those within will manifest externally; for external issues, draw them out, while for internal ones, disperse and descend them. If toxic qi is stagnant, causing blood to coagulate, milder symptoms can be alleviated with medicine, while more severe cases are not fully resolved through medicine, which is why the efficacy of moxibustion is paramount. Generally, for treating sores on the limbs where qi and blood are not deficient, using this method will lead to recovery. If the middle qi is weak, moxibustion should not be performed, and taking medicines to dispel toxins will further harm the middle qi, resulting in inevitable deterioration. Patients with head and neck conditions should also receive moxibustion; however, the mugwort sticks should be small, and the number of applications should be minimal for the best results.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Section 7: The Division of Light and Heavy Using Garlic Cakes</strong></p>
<p>Wu&#39;s statement: In using garlic cakes for moxibustion, garlic is pungent, warm, and toxic, acting to disperse abscesses and boils, relying on the potency of fire to transmit the effects of the medicine. If one uses only an moxa stick, this can be applied to stubborn sores that have long manifested. For cases of severe red swelling, purple-black toxicity, it is best to moxibust with garlic and moxa together. </p>
<p>[Note: The previous method indeed has the power of revival. If the stubborn sore is due to chronic illness and the spleen and stomach are weak, making it so that the vital energy cannot nourish the affected area, resulting in internal cold evils invading and not healing, it is advisable to use small moxa sticks to frequently moxibust the sore&#39;s opening, to dispel the cold evil and replenish the nourishing energy. The method for internal replenishment is discussed in the first discourse and the thirty-second discourse.]</p>
<p><strong>Section 8: The Essential Discussion on Moxibustion Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Wu&#39;s discourse states: The onset of abscesses and boils on the back is due to specific causes, as detailed in the previous chapter. Upon first noticing redness and swelling, one should start from the second hollow on either side of the spine, each 1.5 inches from the body, known as the &quot;Heat Organ Points,&quot; and moxibust each point seven times. This can help to discharge excess Yang heat and eliminate the suffering of abscesses and boils; if moxibusting with garlic is used, the number of applications does not matter, as the evil has no place to reside, while the true energy is preserved. However, if sores appear on the head and neck, it is advisable to use the sitting-on-a-bamboo-horse method along with moxibustion at the &quot;Zusanli&quot; point (Stomach 36). </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Moxibustion for Pain and Itching - Part Nine</strong></p>
<p>Wushi said: When treating boils, carbuncles, shoulder sores, if there is no pain, it is essential to perform moxibustion to induce pain; if there is pain, moxibustion should be done to alleviate it. If pain occurs immediately upon moxibustion, it indicates shallow toxic qi; if there is no pain during moxibustion, the toxic qi is deep and heavy. It is necessary to take internal medicines to expel the toxins and discharge pus, and to apply external medications that draw out the toxins. Generally, boils and carbuncles cannot be entirely painless, but they should not be excessively painful. Cases where there is confusion and lack of awareness of pain are difficult to treat.</p>
<p>[Note: In previous discussions, only the sore condition was mentioned; its symptoms vary widely, with different appearances and colors—some resemble small sores, some like blisters, some are painful, some numb, some have red threads, and others may cause fever, headache, nausea, or muscle stiffness. These symptoms are numerous, and without the previous moxibustion methods and detoxifying agents, it is hard to achieve any effect. If a patient is unresponsive or has tightly clenched teeth, then use the life-reviving powder, ground into fine powder, to administer. When occurring on both legs, often there are red threads reaching to the navel; on both hands, there are usually red threads reaching to the heart; on the lips and face, red threads may reach the throat—all of these are hard to treat. If the red threads are needled to produce bleeding, many will survive. If it attacks the extremities, the toxins become even more stagnated, making it difficult for the medicine to reach; therefore, moxibustion is very important. If one improperly takes purging agents, it depletes genuine qi, not only failing to expel the toxins but potentially causing further harm.]<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Moxibustion for Brain Abscess, Chapter Ten</strong></p>
<p>Li states: For brain abscess and abscesses in the neck, do not use garlic to moxibust, as it may cause the poison to rise and attack. It is advisable to moxibust the Zusanli point with five cones, the Qihai point with three to seven cones, and also take medicines that cool the blood and transform toxins, or use the method of moxibustion at the Qimama point. In general, abscesses that arise in the head, neck, and throat are traditionally considered untreatable. However, using this method has resulted in many recoveries. Herbs such as Wuxiang Lianqiao, Leolu decoction, Guolao ointment, and Wanjin powder can be selected for use.</p>
<p>[Note: The previous symptoms belong to the Bladder channel, which may be due to damp-heat stagnation or yin fire flaring upwards. If caused by damp-heat, the pathogenic qi is excessive and the vital qi is insufficient, then Huanglian Xiaoduo San should be used to eliminate damp toxins, along with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If caused by yin fire, both the vital qi and pathogenic qi are insufficient, then Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pill should be used to nourish the kidney water. If kidney water is depleted and the condition has reached a late stage, immediately use the modified Bawei Pill and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to solidify the foundation and draw the fire back to its source. If the color is dark and does not ulcerate, or ulcerates without healing, it is termed &quot;brain scorching,&quot; which is untreatable. Generally, if there is severe swelling and pain, it is advisable to use the Lifesaving Decoction for moxibustion with garlic to dissolve stagnant blood and draw out the accumulated poison, but the moxa cones should be small and few. If pus is desired to form and ulcerate, along with promoting tissue regeneration and healing, Toli should be the main focus.]<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Protecting the Internal Organs, Section Eleven</strong></p>
<p>Li states: Although there are many remedies for back sores, very few prove effective. Now, I select and record those that have been tested, so as not to mislead others. For instance, the Heart Protecting Powder is to be administered early for any sore disease; taking several doses helps expel toxic substances without causing vomiting. Otherwise, there may be sores in the throat, mouth, or tongue, or they might turn black and rotten like fungus. If the sores appear after four or five days, it is advisable to use other medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Heart Protecting Powder is a remedy for sores caused by metal or stone. If there is fever, swelling, and thirst with vomiting after drinking cold drinks, it is suitable to use. If there is fever, swelling, and thirst with vomiting after drinking broth, it is not advisable to use it. If there is spleen deficiency leading to phlegm stagnation, or internal cold evasion, or pain injuring the spleen and stomach, the Six Gentlemen Decoction should be used. If there are sores on the throat and tongue, dry mouth, thirst, or frequent urination, the Six Flavors Pill is recommended. Generally, if sores induce vomiting and drinking cold leads to constipation, it indicates heat toxicity, which can be relieved with the Huang Lian Xie Du Powder. If drinking cold facilitates bowel movements, it suggests stomach fire, which can be cleared with Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. If there is loss of appetite with broth, it indicates stomach deficiency; use the Central Qi Fortifying Decoction to replenish. If the stool is loose, and one prefers hot broth, it indicates cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach; the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted ginger should be used to warm it. It is commonly observed that those with weak spleen and stomach often use the preceding powder, which can lead to cold and discomfort in the heart, inevitably resulting in vomiting. The sores on the throat and tongue are due to dehydration of kidney water and upward flaming of deficient fire. This condition is quite serious; promptly using the Adjusted Eight Flavor Pill may lead to recovery.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

Yang reflects physical form, while Yin represents essence; these are common principles. When there is disturbance, heat arises if the body steams, otherwise, cold develops. If it solidifies, it becomes lumps; if it sinks, it transforms into abscesses; if it congeals, it results in sores and skin issues; frustration leads to goiters, while anger causes abscesses. Furthermore, if the five organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices will be obstructed; if the six Qi are not harmonious, stagnation leads to abscesses. All are due to blocked meridians, with Qi and blood not flowing smoothly, allowing wind and toxins to seize the opportunity and cause these conditions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion Thirteen</strong></p>
<p>The condition of abscesses, if caused by the depletion of emotional states (the seven emotions), leading to stagnation of qi and blood in the meridians, falls under internal causes. If it is an external invasion by the six pathogenic factors, resulting in injury to qi and blood, with cold transforming into abscesses, that belongs to external causes. If it arises from the consumption of alchemical substances, tonics, rich foods, or excessive labor, it is a combined internal and external cause. Furthermore, it is said that stagnation of yin leads to abscesses, while stagnation of yang results in carbuncles. A floating, rapid, slippery pulse indicates yang, while a sinking, slow, thick pulse indicates yin. Yin is treated with heat, and yang with cold. In the initial stage, the focus should be on clearing heat and expelling toxins; once there is a rupture, the aim should be to drain pus and alleviate pain. Hence, one uses compounds such as polygala, rhubarb, and licorice, representing these three causal methods. The treatment should warm what is cold, clear what is hot, tonify what is deficient, and drain what is excessive, guided by acupuncture, cauterization with moxa, or breaking up toxins and softening hardness, all adhering to established principles, aiming for equilibrium.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the notes, if the pulse is deep and solid, and there is constipation, it indicates an internal cause, and one should use methods to relieve and unblock. If the pulse is superficial and the bowel movements are regular, it indicates an external cause, and one should use methods to promote. If the pulse is neither superficial nor deep, it indicates neither internal nor external causes, and one should harmonize the defensive and nutritive qi. This is also a method of treating the three causes. If there is swelling, severe pain, restlessness, heat, a preference for cold drinks, constipation, and a pulse that is surging, rapid, and solid, this is pure Yang, and bitter-cold herbs should be used to clear heat and expel toxins. Conversely, if there is no swelling or pain, there is diarrhea, a lack of appetite, vomiting, and cold extremities, this is pure Yin, and warming, spicy herbs should be used to greatly supplement Yang qi. Regardless of whether it is extreme cold or intense heat, one should adjust based on the condition. If there is slight swelling and slight pain, resembling a potential abscess but occasionally discharging clear pus, this is half Yin and half Yang, and one should use warming, spicy herbs to tonify the stomach qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of the Plain Questions, Chapter Fourteen</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: When the yang qi gathers and strikes, cold transforms into heat. When heat is excessive, flesh rots into pus. Generally, back abscesses are often caused by taking metals and stones, or from previous generations who took such substances. The symptoms often arise from the spleen, appearing like grains, sometimes painful or itchy, often leading to severe conditions, appearing externally like a fist. The ancients described the outside as similar to hemp and the inside like a melon. There are several dozen openings; when pressed, pus may emerge from them, and one may lose their voice for a time. For this condition, one may use pure earth water, mixing it into a thick paste for cakes, and moxibustion with mugwort sticks. Internally, consume a Five-Spice and Lianqiao decoction, and apply a mix of iron essence and vinegar with clam shell ash. Furthermore, use the riding bamboo horse technique for moxibustion, which is quite effective.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of the Thousand Gold, Chapter Fifteen</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: When boils and carbuncles first occur, there may be either great pain or minor pain, or if something appears like a grain, pus will surely emerge. It is advisable to urgently cut off sour tastes and eliminate the poison, using the riding bamboo horse moxibustion technique, or directly burning mugwort on the affected area. For severe cases, thicken moxibustion at the central and surrounding areas with one or two hundred vigorous applications, and additionally apply cold remedies; the effect is remarkably swift.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Differentiating Symptoms of Abscesses, Part Sixteen</strong></p>
<p>Wu stated: The diseases of carbuncles manifest in over twenty symptoms, including sudden onset (early-stage), chronic onset, stone-like nodules, rock-like nodules, bee-hive nodules, lotus-like nodules, peppery-nodules, string-of-pearls nodules, and nodules that appear in the entire body. Internally, there are abscesses in the intestines, on the brain&#39;s back, in the eyebrows, in the jaw and cheeks, as well as lung abscesses and melon-husk abscesses. Generally, treatment should be adjusted based on the severity of the illness and should be applied both internally and externally without delay. When onset is like a floating and tense pulse due to a cold injury, this indicates the condition. </p>
<p>(Note: Although these symptoms have different names, the treatment methods are detailed elsewhere. Lung and gastric abscesses are separately recorded.)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Symptoms, Part Seventeen</strong></p>
<p>Chen Wuze stated: In cases of abscesses, the pulse is rapid, there is no fever, but the patient experiences severe chills; if there is a painful area, this indicates an abscess. When feeling over the area, if it feels hot, it indicates the presence of pus; if not hot, there is no pus. If the pulse is not rapid, and there is no fever but pain, it indicates a condition arising from the Yin, which is particularly serious. When heat is severe and the pulse is rapid, a remedy should include Luoluo Powder and decoctions of rhubarb. If there is not much heat and the pulse is weak and slow, use Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction, following the order of the four seasons and eight conditions for medication; there will be no case that does not respond positively.</p>
<p>(Note: The symptoms of severe chills may relate to external pathogens of the sore, or to internal deficiency of the spleen and lungs. If after an abscess ruptures there is swelling and pain with severe chills, fever, thirst, and a rapid pulse, this indicates true qi deficiency and full evil qi; further consultation of the main text is advised for detailing.)<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Vomiting and Reversal (Section 19)</strong></p>
<p>Li states: “The presence of carbuncles and vomiting is due to toxic energy invading the heart, not the coldness of the spleen and stomach; one should take internal expelling powders.” Yang states: “If nosebleeds just healed and there hasn’t been sweating on the surface, then the toxins are within the meridians, leading to large carbuncles on the back. From the shoulders down to the waist and flanks, there is swelling hard as stone, with a purple-black hue. If cool medicines are administered, there will be vomiting throughout the night. Continuing with the expelling powders will stop the vomiting, leading to ulceration with reddish fluids, healing in forty days. Additionally, there are those who suffer from ulcers, where pain leads to vomiting. Taking this will stop the vomiting.” Now if there are patients with carbuncles who do not take this medicine, I reference Yang’s words to clarify the confusion of the world.<br><em>Note: According to medical practice, certain illnesses must use specific remedies. However, in today&#39;s cases, the majority experience weakness and coldness in the spleen and stomach, with reversed qi and phlegm causing nausea. Only a small percentage suffer from internal heat toxins leading to vomiting; this should be considered with the first discussion and the main points of the eleventh discussion.</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Source (Section 20)</strong></p>
<p>The source of carbuncles arises from either qi or heat; as I see it, it can also stem from improper food and excess of rich, fatty meals, or from sexual excess leading to the use of metals and stones. Therefore, the treatment should include mung beans, rhinoceros horn, alum, Gualao ointment, and the Zhuidu pills, all undeniably toxic. What Hua Tuo mentioned in &quot;Zhongcang&quot; refers to toxins; taking medicine that clears heat and eradicates toxins is assuredly necessary.<br><em>Note: If prior evidence indicates it is caused by metals and stones, then for those with abundant vital energy, this method is indeed advisable. But if heat from rich foods has piled up, or if there is excessive sexual activity, or weakness in the spleen and kidneys, the source of transformation should be nourished and not rigidly enforced.</em><a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Hua Tuo&#39;s Discussion, Chapter Twenty-One</strong></p>
<p>The occurrence of sores, swellings, and ulcers arises when the organs accumulate toxins that do not flow; it is not solely due to the obstruction of nourishment and defense. Their manifestations have specific locations and principal causes. For example, if they appear on the throat or tongue, it is the heart&#39;s toxin; if on the muscles, it is the spleen&#39;s toxin; if on the bones and marrow, it is the kidney&#39;s toxin; if they erupt from below, it comes from the yin toxins, and if from above, from the yang toxins; externally, it is the toxins of the six bowels, and internally, it is the toxins of the five organs. Therefore, what occurs internally is termed &quot;bad,&quot; externally it is termed &quot;follow,&quot; and what occurs below is termed &quot;reverse.&quot; Manifestations from above develop quickly, while those from below develop slowly. When affected by the six bowels, treatment is easier; when affected by the five organs, recovery is difficult. </p>
<p>Moreover, conditions near the bones are often cold, while those near the skin are often hot. If it lingers near the bones, it may transform into blood worms; if near the skin, it may lead to leaks of energy. When worms develop, there is often more itching and less pain, sometimes itching first and pain later; with leaks, there is often more pain and less itching, or neither pain nor itching. In cases where there is internal deficiency and external surplus, there tends to be more pain and less itching; if bleeding does not stop, there is a higher chance of death, while suppuration often leads to recovery. </p>
<p>Occasionally, there is boundless vomiting or reversal, and meals may be taken at irregular times; these are all effects of sores and ulcers, with varied symptoms. Careful treatment is essential. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The emergence of worms in sores and ulcers is attributed to wind-heat from the liver, while leaks stem from weakened vital energy; bleeding is associated with spleen deficiency accompanied by heat, and suppuration indicates robust vital energy. Conditions like vomiting and reversal are caused by deficiencies in the spleen and stomach, and one should focus on tonifying the vital energy to ensure safety.]</strong><a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Original Causes</strong></p>
<p>There are five causes: First, the body is weak and energy is stagnated; second, there is excess anger; third, kidney energy is deficient; fourth, consuming cold beverages and excessive hot food; fifth, taking medicinal pills. (Note: Although the causes of preceding symptoms may differ, the treatment should also consider the respective meridians, yin and yang, deficiency and excess, and the exterior and interior swellings, primarily strengthening the stomach and enhancing energy, thereby solidifying the foundation to ensure safety.)</p>
<p><strong>On Distinguishing Between Exterior and Interior</strong></p>
<p>The Wu clan states: Boils and sores arise from unpredictable emotions, irregular diet, imbalance of yin and yang, disharmony of organs, loose pores, and cold air invading the meridians. If the blood and energy are chilled, they may stagnate and not flow, leading to exterior pathogens. When confronted with cold, it obstructs and prevents flow; if yang energy accumulates, it can lead to alternating cold and heat, which will not disperse, resulting in previous symptoms. Furthermore, all the points of the five organs and six bowels are located on the back. In general, wounds are prone to injure the membranes of the organs, often leading to failure in treatment. The bowels&#39; energy flows near the surface, hence exterior boils are easier to treat; while the blood of the organs is cold and resides deep, making internal sores more difficult to treat. It is also mentioned that a festering boil is a &quot;jie&quot; (section), an abscess is a &quot;yong&quot; (obstruction), and a sore is a &quot;ju&quot; (depression). A size of one to two inches is a boil, three to five inches is an abscess, five inches to one foot is a sore, and one to two feet is a severe sore. If the pulse is rapid and surging, treatment is difficult; if the pulse is weak and stagnant, treatment is easier.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Initially, one should clear heat and expel toxins. Once an abscess has formed, focus on draining pus and relieving pain; when the pus is fully expelled, promote tissue regeneration and scabbing. The approach should be adapted based on the severity of the condition and the clinical signs.</p>
<p>(Note: If there is a lack of appetite due to anxiety, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the spleen and stomach; if there is no response, add ginger and cinnamon for warmth and support, aiding in the withdrawal of pathogenic influences. If no improvement is seen, it indicates that the pathogenic influence is strong and the vital energy is deficient, preventing resolution, which can take about ten days. If it has already manifested, use the Decoction to Promote Recovery and Detoxify to enhance vital energy and assist in the drainage of pus; if there is no response, warmth and nourishment of the spleen and stomach is necessary. If there is still no response, the cause may be a deficiency in true energy, which prevents the formation of pus, and this can appear beyond twenty days. If suppuration has occurred, use the Decoction to Promote Recovery to nourish qi and blood, and generate muscle; if there is still no response, focus on nurturing the spleen and stomach; if there is still no response, warmth and nourishment of the spleen and stomach is necessary.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatment Methods of Yin and Yang - Chapter 25</strong></p>
<p>Zeng said: In cases of boils and sores, the pulse is floating, rapid, surging, and tight; there is swelling, pain, body heat, and thirst. Eating and drinking remain normal. This indicates disharmony in the six fu organs, with toxins manifesting externally as boils. Although the situation is urgent, administering cooling remedies often preserves life. If the pulse is deep, thin, suppressed, and tight; the onset is very mild, sometimes without visible sores; the body does not heat up, but there is internal restlessness, a heavy and painful body, a lack of joy, chest tightness, and lack of taste in food; this indicates disharmony in the five zang organs, with toxins accumulating internally, leading to sores. In this case, quickly administer the Five Spice and Forsythia Decoction; in more severe cases, use detoxifying dispersals, celestial spirit intercepting method, yellow alum pills, or national elder ointment to prevent the emission of toxic qi and avoid transformation into more serious internal attacks. It is particularly advisable to perform garlic moxibustion at the crown of the head. If toxic medicaments are applied, they may obstruct the pores; if cooling medicines are administered, they may deplete the true qi. Therefore, the quality of the symptoms—good or bad—depends on the skill of the physician. Manifestations such as sighing, blockage, reverse cough, cold body with spontaneous sweating, wide-eyed and deaf, confusion and shock, disjointed speech, are all adverse symptoms. If five good signs are evident, recovery is likely; if seven bad signs are present, danger is imminent. When five good signs are simultaneously present, there is nothing more to add to the goodness; when seven bad signs all converge, then the severity of the bad condition is grave.</p>
<p><em>[Note: The good signs mentioned earlier imply that the five organs have not been harmed, the illness is mild and the invasion shallow, allowing for careful conduct of daily life and moderation in food intake to achieve self-healing without medicine. The bad symptoms indicate damage to the five organs; although ancient scholars said not to treat them, if one can strengthen the spleen and stomach, reinforcing the foundation, there are many who can survive. How can one abandon them solely because of their bad condition?]</em><a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

<p>A question was asked: Some illnesses are severe leading to death, while others are mild leading to death; the symptoms are difficult to discern. How can we determine life and death? The answer is: If the back erupts and penetrates the inner membrane, that is death (this refers to conditions related to the liver). If it has not penetrated and the face is pale and lips black, that indicates death (this means the organs are damaged and there is stagnant blood). If there is a throat ulcer, it is incurable. If there is a hidden ailment in the abdomen, it is incurable. If it enters the sac, it is incurable. If the temples are deeply sunk by several inches, it is also incurable. Located one inch and three-tenths behind the jaw, this condition, called sharp poison, is likewise incurable. If none of these conditions are present, there is hope for life.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Treating Illnesses Should Be Done Early</p>
<p>The Wu family states: When a carbuncle appears, the skin is thin and the swelling is high, often with numerous black spots; when an abscess appears, the skin is tough, resembling the hide of a cow. Both conditions should be treated with cautery using moxa. If a carbuncle forms pus, it should be needled using a horseshoe-shaped iron needle, which is sharp on both sides and can be used to make cuts of about five or six inches to drain the toxic blood, after which the condition will improve significantly. Cauterization should be done first, followed by incision. One may take the Immortal’s Pursuit of Toxins pill to help eliminate the toxic roots, then follow with medicines that help drain pus and regulate the body.</p>
<p>If an abscess forms pus, cauterization is advisable. Use a silver rod, about one inch wide and six inches long, heated until red, and frequently cauterize the affected area until the pus is expelled. Generally speaking, carbuncles and abscesses are more difficult to treat than other ailments; without the heart’s transmission of secret techniques, can they be easily cured? </p>
<p>[Note: If the vital energy and blood are robust and pus has formed, it is essential to needling promptly, without relying solely on medicines to heal. If the vital energy and blood are deficient, the pus may not be able to drain, or it may cause pain when it does, necessitating care to nourish the stomach to ensure a favorable outcome.

<p>The Wu family states: One may feel a red, itchy swelling and pain between the shoulder blades, possibly accompanied by white spots.

Many people mistakenly believe that excess heat causes the condition to spread, leading to numerous errors! </p>
<p>(Note: In cases of abscess on the back, if there is necrosis with pus oozing and persistent pain, it may be due to a layer of muscle tissue that prevents the pus from draining.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Recognizing Colors and Preventing Spread (Chapter 31)</strong></p>
<p>Wu said: If there is a sore that is swollen and red, and pressing it does not change its color, this indicates that pus has already formed. If pressing it causes the color to change with your hand, there is also pus present. If pressing it takes a long time to turn red, this indicates that the wandering toxin has subsided; cauterization can be done at the junction of red and white, and the red swelling will naturally diminish. In general, for abscesses, if they feel firm upon touch, there is no pus; if they are half soft and half hard, pus is present. Additionally, if the swollen area does not feel hot, then there is no pus; if it feels very hot, pus is likely present and should be urgently drained.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the toxic qi in a sore has congealed and does not erupt, it is advisable to tonify the blood and qi to hasten the formation of pus before using a needle. Once the pus has erupted, it is important to nourish the spleen and stomach to promote muscle generation and close the wound. Generally, when pus and blood from sores have ruptured, the priority should be to greatly replenish blood and qi, and even in the presence of other symptoms, one should focus on this as the primary treatment.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Title: Difficult Closure of Wounds</strong></p>
<p>For long-term untreated abscesses that do not close, with white tissue and little pus, this indicates both qi and blood deficiency, leading to cold and stagnation at the wound site. Every day, use a handful of mugwort leaves to brew soup, wash the wound with care to avoid wind and heat, and use incense smoke for fumigation, then apply a miraculous ointment to the wound. It is essential to adhere to dietary restrictions and manage the condition; otherwise, it will not be effective. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the cold evil has solidified and obstructed the flow of qi and blood, it is advisable to use this method to dispel cold evil and replenish yang qi, which has great efficacy. If the issue arises from qi and blood deficiency that prevents the wound from healing, it is best to nourish the spleen and stomach to generate qi and blood. Master Danxi states that among all channels, only the lesser yang and jueyin are prone to abscess formation, and preventive measures are necessary due to their high qi and low blood levels. With insufficient blood, muscle growth is hindered, and long-standing wounds will inevitably lead to failure to heal.

In case of secretive blockages, the Divine Efficacy Hemp Seed Pill is effective. After a sore has ulcerated, if there remains a feeling of internal heat, one can take the Five-Spice Decoction with added Da Huang and (Shi Bu) Nitrate. When treating sores, warm medicines should first include cassia to promote blood circulation and guide other medicines; cool medicines must use Rehmannia to replenish deficits and enhance Qi, filling the marrow.

<p>Wu said: For the condition of abscess and sore, the patient should self-examine. In the beginning, encircle the affected area with ink, and observe the rising and falling, gathering and dispersing; check the amount of pus that comes out and the width and narrowness of the flesh that grows. Monitor the quality of food and drink, and be mindful of any secretions from the organs. Prevent excessive opening of the wound. It is essential to avoid anger, regulate labor, nourish the vital energy, and maintain careful observation; negligence is not acceptable! </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This echoes what Master Danxi said regarding abscesses: one should first support the stomach to strengthen the energy, making the foundation solid. Master Dongyuan taught people to have a balanced diet and a regular lifestyle. The &quot;Suwen&quot; reiterates this, so one must be cautious! In general, diarrhea easily depletes vital energy; if swelling and sores affect it, pus cannot form; if ulcers affect it, flesh cannot grow. Patients should be vigilant! </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Healing with Aromatic Medicines – Section 36</strong></p>
<p>Wu said: Qi and blood flow with fragrance and stagnate with foul odors. Generally, sores and abscesses often stem from a failure of the protective qi to circulate, becoming stagnant in the flesh, which then coalesces into pus. The fragrance promotes the circulation of qi and blood; therefore, one should frequently take soups with five spices and honeysuckle, and Jinfen powder. Sores are originally foul and filthy; if they are met with a bad smell, they worsen. If poison enters the stomach, it leads to cough and rebellion; the ancients utilized this, and it can be deemed reasonable. Additionally, regulate food and drink to be fragrant and delicious to benefit the spleen and nourish the true essence, ensuring that there are no future worries. </p>

There was a patient whose pus did not come to a head; a toxic substance was applied, worsening the situation, and the poison spread to the throat and knees, leading to a state that could not be cured. I used this plaster, and by morning it had opened up completely. Whenever an abscess produces pus, its poison begins to resolve. If there are cases where it does not rupture, this plaster must be applied. Therefore, I record it, hoping that those discerning may choose to modify and combine it to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>[Note: Cases previously mentioned belong to a yang condition, where qi and blood are unharmed; applying the previous plaster will surely result in healing. However, there are also cases belonging to yin conditions where qi and blood are deficient; one must consider the cause and adjust the internal treatment accordingly. Generally, the formation of sores and ulcers arises from the stomach qi not being coordinated; their rupture results from the stomach qi decaying; their healing comes from the nourishment of the stomach qi. I often treat cases where pus first forms by promoting dispersal; if pus is about to form, I promote decay; if pus has formed but not yet ruptured, I promote opening; and if it has already ruptured, I promote healing. Dr. Dong Yuan said: Stomach qi is the source of growth and is fundamental to the human body. Dr. Danxi also remarked that to treat sores, one must aid the stomach to strengthen the qi, solidifying the foundation. Truly insightful!] </p>

The classics say: Wind is good at rapid movement and change, entering the viscera swiftly; life and death hinge on immediate response. One should urgently distinguish between the superficial and the internal, as well as between deficiency and excess, to treat accordingly. If the evil is in the exterior, it causes stiffness in the bones and muscles, chills, and tightness; the pulse will be superficial and taut, indicating the need for Qianghuo and Fangfeng decoction to harmonize and resolve it. If it has penetrated inward, there will be a strong tongue, a sealed mouth, a stiff neck and back, tight and painful muscles, excessive phlegm, fullness in the chest and abdomen, possible constipation or red urination, occasional sweating, and a flooding, rapid, taut pulse, requiring Dahuang and Qionghuo decoction to guide it out. Initial sweating results from wind-heat stagnating inside, thus also needing similar methods for purgation.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When heat has receded and the organs are harmonized, yet there is still sweating, this indicates exterior deficiency. It is advisable to use Bai Zhu and Fang Feng Decoction to strengthen the exterior.

If pus and blood stagnate internally and present the previous symptoms, acupuncture is recommended along with an urgent dose of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If there is jaw stiffness and urinary incontinence, this indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood, and similarly, Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Pao Fu Zi should be used. Generally, if this condition is due to excessive loss of pus and blood, one should use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang reinforced with Qiang Huo as its main ingredient. If a person has a history of phlegm and presents with symptoms of wind due to injury, the prescription should include Er Chen Tang, Bai Zhu, Chuan Xiong, Gui, Zhi Zi, Qin, and Lian. For qi deficiency, add Si Jun Zi Tang; for blood deficiency, add Si Wu Tang. If both blood and qi are deficient with severe internal heat causing wind, then Si Wu Tang combined with Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chai Hu, Qin, and Zhi Zi is recommended. If the patient experiences tetanus that unexpectedly recurs after three to five years, or if they have suffered injuries from falls, this is also due to deficiency of qi and phlegm; use Er Chen Tang, Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Chuan Xiong, and Gui as the main ingredients.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

<p>Zeng said: When boils and sores become filled with pus, applying the Substitute Needle Powder causes the wound to open on its own. The ancients said: Boils can be lethal. If the medicinal needle fits the condition, one lives; if it does not fit, one dies. How careless! </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In cases of sores, if toxic qi has already coagulated, causing swelling and redness to become intense, and the flesh in the center dies and turns dark, one should internally use medicines to clear heat and strengthen the spleen, and externally apply black gold ointment. Gradually, the dark area will lower and the red area will rise. Within six or seven days, a crack will appear where the red and dark meet, resembling a cut, and the dark will gradually rupture. It is best if this is done without feeling pain or seeing fresh blood. If pus has not yet flowed freely, use a needle to draw it from the lines; if pus has begun to flow, but swelling and pain persist, there may be internal sinew barriers, and a needle should be used to draw it out. If the vital energy is weak and one mistakenly takes a harmful remedy, resulting in a lack of pain at the affected site or dead flesh that does not rupture, one must urgently warm and nourish the spleen and stomach, as there may still be a chance to regenerate. Following this, pure nourishment of the spleen and stomach should be done to help consolidate. If one recklessly uses needles and knives, removing flesh and causing bleeding, it disperses the yang with the yin, hastening danger. If the pus ruptures but pain persists without healing, with a pulse that is surging, slippery, and greatly dispersed, it indicates a deficiency of true qi with the presence of邪气, making it difficult to treat; if the pulse is weak, thin, and slow, it indicates a deficiency of邪气 and the recovery of true qi, making it easier to treat.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

If taken over a long period, one will never feel thirsty again and will not display symptoms of abscesses; both the vital energy and blood will be robust—this is indeed a genuine sacred remedy!</p>

<p>Li said: If the stomach Qi is weak and does not accept food, it is suitable to take the Jiahe Powder, adding two Qian each of ginseng, clove, fragrant sandalwood, and white cardamom for every five Liang. There was a noble who suffered from carbuncles; due to an improper order of medication, the spleen became weak and he could not eat. I intended to use the Jiahe Powder. Someone mentioned the presence of clove and fragrant sandalwood inside, suggesting to take them separately as medicine, but it did not respond. So, I continued with the previous powder, and his appetite returned immediately.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fifty-Fourth Example of Leaking Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The classic states: the sinking pulse is considered leakage, lingering in the flesh’s pores. When the pulse is affected by cold, it sinks and stagnates in the muscles, hence it is said to linger in the flesh’s pores, referred to as cold leakage. One must use Sinking Pulse Powder and Cinnamon and Aconite Pill to warm and tonify.</p>
<p>**[Note] According to sores and ulcers classified as leakage, these arise from insufficient vital energy, with the nutritive energy not following properly, reverting against the flesh’s structure, or being impeded by cold, blocking the blood vessels, which leads to decay over time. When Yang energy becomes deficient and cold, external pathogens take advantage of the weakness and cause sinking, resulting in this condition. </p>
<p>If treated in the initial stage, one should internally use Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica, and Atractylodes to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach, while externally applying mulberry branches and scallions for moxibustion to guide the Yang energy for spontaneous resolution. If it takes too long to form pus, use the aforementioned methods to assist in hastening it. </p>
<p>If pus has formed but does not flow out, burn a few moxa cones directly on it to encourage drainage, and take the Comprehensive Boosting Decoction. The patient should also be careful with daily living and moderate their diet to facilitate recovery. </p>
<p>Should one mistakenly use cold needles for puncturing, it will lead to delayed internal emission of blue pus with a dark external appearance; or if they erroneously use a wound-healing powder to hasten closure, it will instead support the evil and lead to certain failure.**<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Technique of the Cicada Needle, No. 55</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Hong treated carbuncles and ulcers by initially using a single pen tube to insert a cicada. The mouth of the tube was directed at the center of the sore, allowing the cicada to suck out the pus and blood, thereby dispersing the poison. If the sore was larger, it was necessary to replace it with three or four cicadas. If the cicada sucked the precise spot, it would surely die. This method was repeatedly tested with consistent results. If the bleeding did not stop, apply mud from lotus stems to the area. If the sore was not clearly defined, applying mud from the edge of a well to the dry parts first would suffice. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once a carbuncle or ulcer has formed, the toxic blood coagulates externally, making this method effective in drawing it out, but it only addresses the surface issue. It is also essential to assess whether the illness is superficial or deep, and to consider the condition of the vital energy when administering medication, as this integrates both internal and external treatments, leading to a complete cure.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a></p></div>

If there is no suppuration or necrosis, it suggests yang deficiency; use &quot;Four Gentlemen Decoction&quot; with Astragalus and cinnamon. If pus is present but pain recurs, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood; use &quot;Eight Treasure Powder.&quot; If the wound does not generate flesh and does not close up, it points to spleen qi deficiency; treat with &quot;Four Gentlemen Decoction,&quot; adding peony and nutmeg. Additionally, treatment should be based on timing and specific symptoms; if there is swelling and pain, agitation and fever, cold drinks leading to constipation, and a rapid, strong pulse, it indicates five excesses.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Osteomyelitis</strong></p>
<p>Osteomyelitis arises when an ulcer has festered for a long time, failing to nourish the affected area with qi and blood. The pathogenic qi invades and, over time, decays the tendons and bones until they are expelled. This is associated with the deficiency of the three yin of the foot. Use the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang&quot; (Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction) to strengthen the foundation. </p>
<p>If there is heat from yin fire, add &quot;Liu Wei Di Huang Wan&quot; (Six-Flavor Rehmanniacapsule) to strengthen the water element and calm the yang. If there is deficiency and coldness of yang qi, use &quot;Ba Wei Wan&quot; (Eight-Flavor Pill) to nourish the source of fire and dispel the yin obstruction. Externally, apply a paste of aconite and scallion to dispel the cold evil and supplement the nourishing qi; thus, the bones will detach and the sores will heal naturally.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones; if kidney qi is deficient, the bones gradually swell, and as time passes, the bones may fester and expel. The same methods should be employed. If harsh medications are applied to attack the condition, it may further damage the vital qi, and it is rare to avoid mishaps. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Carbuncles and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>A carbuncle represents stagnation and belongs to the Yang organ systems; its toxins manifest externally, appearing abruptly and affecting the surface, without injuring muscles or bones. An abscess signifies depletion and pertains to the Yin organ systems; its toxins strike internally, emerging slowly and delving deeply, damaging muscles and eroding bones. Generally, in young individuals, the vigor of qi and blood overcomes toxins, leading to favorable outcomes. In the elderly, overpowering toxins combined with weak qi and blood create danger. </p>
<p>In cases where internal dietary factors accumulate toxins, the text states: &#39;Rich and fatty foods lead to major carbuncles.&#39; When the nourishing qi does not flow properly, it rejoices against the flesh and skin. The nourishing qi refers to the stomach qi; when the stomach is harmonious, the defensive and nourishing energies thrive and nourish the skin. Rich foods and excessive heating of the body can give rise to internal heat, accumulating dampness and heat, exhausting kidney water, and intensifying Yin fire. Consequently, the eight vessels boil and stagnate, impeding the ascent of refined essences from food, which then stagnates in the flesh and leads to carbuncles.</p>
<p>In cases of external pathogen invasion from wind, cold, and dampness causing toxins, the text states: &#39;The dampness of the earth harms the skin and flesh.&#39; It also mentions: &#39;All abscesses, swellings, muscle constrictions, and bone pains arise from cold and the transformation of the eight winds.&#39; When external factors of wind and dampness invade over time, they transform into heat. This heat may migrate from the bladder to the small intestine, and then from the small intestine to the gallbladder. Wind tends to urge upwards, creating lesions that are raised, red, and painful; smaller ones are boils, while larger ones are carbuncles, not like the internal conditions of abscesses.</p>
<p>Additionally, there can be cases resulting from stagnant heart qi due to overeating or fasting, excessive labor, or sexual indulgence, leading to depletion of water and flames. Phlegm and qi stagnate, causing lesions. The so-called fire of the heart can give rise to sores and ulcers; all pains and itching related to sores and ulcers are attributed to heart fire.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to the presence of fire, there are manifestations of the illness: the sores may be small and intense, with some causing pain without significant swelling, while others may be swollen without much pain. Nevertheless, the illness is generally attributed to damp-heat. Danxi states: In the human body, blood flows within the vessels, while qi flows outside the vessels. When cold and dampness impede, the flow becomes stagnant and slow; when fire and heat hinder, it boils over and flows rapidly. Qi may become obstructed, and body fluids may turn into phlegm or drink, gradually infiltrating the vessels, causing blood to become turbid, leading to stagnation of yin within yang, resulting in abscesses. Conversely, if blood becomes obstructed, it may overflow or congeal, and if this continues for a long time, it spills out of the vessels, causing disorder in qi, leading to stagnation of yang within yin, resulting in festering sores. Yang qi is formless, while yin blood has substance; thus, it is essential for damp-heat to cause blood to weep before abscesses or sores develop. Therefore, the &quot;Jufang&quot; states: Both abscesses and sores arise from excessive heat in the blood.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: When two forms of heat clash, heat transforms into pus. Heat cannot corrupt and break down muscle into pus without the presence of moisture. For example, in summer, various things do not spoil; decay occurs primarily when the humid heat of autumn prevails, and this principle is quite clear. </p>
<p>There are sores that are large yet heal, and others as small as a bean that lead to death. </p>
<p>For an external outbreak (yang), it starts with thin skin, generating heat, appearing red, swelling, and painful; after it breaks, the flesh appears red and lively, which is easy to treat when there is good health and appetite. One may experience fever and constipation, with a rapid and strong pulse, indicating pure yang, which is easier to heal.</p>
<p>For an internal outbreak (yin), it begins with thick skin, not generating heat, appearing dark and slightly swollen and hard, similar to the skin on a cow’s neck, not painful, soft on the inside, not producing pus, and only slightly open upon rupture; after it breaks, the flesh appears purple-black. This indicates an internal issue; before it ruptures, the internal organs may already be damaged. Additionally, there will be fatigue, less appetite, no fever, and a soft, weak pulse, indicating pure yin, which is hard to treat.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are conditions that are half Yin and half Yang, where one may feel swollen but not really swollen, where pain may seem present but isn&#39;t truly painful, where redness appears but isn&#39;t really red, and where there seems to be pus but isn&#39;t actually there. The pulse is rapid and weak, resembling a state with more Yang than Yin; using medicine to support the interior, those with excessive Yang will survive. Conversely, if there is more Yin and less Yang, using a medicine to support as well will not help, and one must rely on Yin will lead to death. Among these, the crucial life-and-death principle particularly lies in engaging with heat and the absence of heat. In essence, Yang patterns with heat facilitate the circulation of Qi and blood, promoting the growth of flesh; while Yin patterns without heat lead to stagnation of Qi and blood, preventing them from gathering. When heat is present, it is imperative not to reduce the heat, but instead to use warming medicine to clear and drain. Minor boils and toxins, even without heat, are not detrimental. </p>
<p>Although boils and abscesses primarily manifest in one meridian, they may also involve two, often accompanied by symptoms of wind, dampness, phlegm, Qi, blood, or Yin deficiency. Generally, when there are symptoms of wind, food stagnation, and both, one uses the core formula of Jin Zhengqi San, adding Chuanxiong and Muxiang. If wind predominates with itching, one adds wind-dispersing medicine; if Qi predominates with pain, one adds Qi-regulating medicine; if food stagnation triggers alternating cold and heat, one adds food-dissolving medicine; if dampness predominates with swelling, one adds damp-draining medicine. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are classifications for sores: heat sores are painful, empty sores are pale white, and wind-cold sores have white edges. According to ancient methods based on the four external influences, one can simply use a combination of Dahuang, both cooked and raw, with Licorice, grinding them into a powder and taking a spoonful with liquor on an empty stomach for its purgative effects; considering internal causes stemming from emotional disturbances, one could use Yuan Zhi (Polygala) ground into powder, mixed with two qian of liquor, and after clarification, take it while applying the residue to the affected area; also employing the method of using Jinshi (gold and stone) combustion to counteract labor, through Guolao Gao (Old Man&#39;s Ointment). For all hot toxins, one can use Sophora flower combined with liquor; substances like gold and stone when toxic may be as hard as stone and painless, thus it is advisable to use a decoction of Licorice and black beans to alleviate them.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Weakness and emaciation, the situation of nourishment and protection being in disarray, the afflicted area feels heavy as if bearing a stone. However, due to the presence of bone steaming heat, treatment should be nourishing, and therefore it is inappropriate to use pungent and drying medicines like Sai Ming Dan or to excessively use fire-reducing and spleen-obstructing medicines. Only Shenqi Wan and Toli San are quite suitable. Moreover, ancient texts state that toxic medicines aggravate severe boils and abscesses.</p>
<p>Areas closer to the bones are often cold; over time, blood may transform into worms, leading to more itching than pain. Areas closer to deficiency tend to be hot; over time, Qi may leak, causing more pain than itching.</p>
<p>The hair of the head pertains to the kidney channel and the foot Taiyang meridian; the sideburns relate to the hand and foot Shaoyang meridians; the eyebrows relate to both hand and foot Taiyang and Shaoyang meridians; beard and jaw hair correspond to the foot Yangming meridian; cheek hair pertains to the hand Yangming meridian; back hair is associated with the governing vessel while the rest belongs to the foot Taiyang meridian; underarm hair corresponds to the hand Taiyang meridian; breast hair relates to both the internal Yangming and external Shaoyang meridians; the nipples correspond to the foot Jueyin meridian; kidney abscesses relate to the foot Taiyang meridian; external kidney abscesses relate to the foot Jueyin meridian; leg hair corresponds to both external and internal three Yang and three Yin meridians; throat and belly button abscesses involve the conception vessel and foot Yangming meridian; hair in the groin, the governing, chong, and conception vessels, and tumorous issues from riding relate to the foot Jueyin meridian; internal boils: lung abscesses relate to the hand Taiyin meridian; intestinal abscesses involve hand Taiyang and Yangming meridians; stomach abscesses correspond to the foot Yangming meridian. If Shaoyang and Shaoyin are energetic with little blood, while Jueyin and Taiyang are abundant in blood with little energy, balancing the flesh becomes difficult. Only the hand and foot Yangming channels are abundant in both Qi and blood. When prescribing according to the channels, one must not violate the prohibitions of the channels or the diseases, leading to erroneous purging or sweating. Furthermore, ulcers pertaining to the kidney channel are the most severe, followed by those of the spleen and lung channels, with others being less serious. The brain is where all Yang channels converge, the throat connects to food intake, and the kidney is tied to the root of life, all being precarious areas where one should not apply too much moxibustion.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a></p></div>

The poison originates from external factors; if there are no obstructions to urination internally and the six meridians present with patterns, although there is significant swelling and pain, eating and drinking are normal, and the pulse is floating and rapid, the evil is at the surface. Thus, one should administer a mild sweating treatment to disperse it from the surface. </p>
<p>If the symptoms manifest in the head, back, and neck, use Huanglian Xiaodu San; if in the buttocks, use Qianghuo Decoction; for the arms, use Baizhi Shengma Decoction; for the breast and chest, use Shengma Decoction; for both sides of the ribs, use Shiwai Zhonghe Decoction; for the outer thigh, use a wine decoction; and for the inner thigh near the knee, use Qi Chai Decoction. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The remedy for those who are filled with anger involves a combination of sixteen flavors of flowing qi drinks. For those suffering from internal deficiency, one should use the Tuo Li Xiao Du San, Nei Tuo Fu Jian San, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. In ancient times, the treatment for abscesses with cold medicines was the standard method; treating sores with hot medicines was an auxiliary approach. This is because the nature of hot medicine promotes circulation, while cold medicine causes dispersal. Sores are tangible entities, and it is not feasible for a hot medicine to merely assist in their treatment. This reflects the principles of internal support and internal dispersal, as well as the contrast between primary treatment and auxiliary treatment.</p>
<p>After an abscess ruptures, there is a significant depletion of qi and blood, raising fears of poison infiltration; thus, the method of Tuo Li cannot be neglected even for a day. Ancient formulas such as Tuo Li San, Tuo Li Qing Zhong Tang, Tuo Li Ding Zhong Tang, Tuo Li He Zhong Tang, Tuo Li Jian Zhong Tang, Tuo Li Yi Qing Tang, and Tuo Li Yi Qi Tang should be selected. By supporting with Tuo Li, qi and blood are strengthened, the spleen and stomach are robust, pus and filth are expelled on their own, toxins are resolved naturally, dead tissue breaks down, new flesh forms, and the wound closes by itself. If one fails to focus on support and mistakenly employs cold or cool treatments, it could aggravate the evil fire, lead to excessive pus and foul smell, and in severe cases, result in a rapid pulse, extreme thirst, true qi deficiency, and death.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Danxi said: &quot;When one observes swelling and pain, if the pulse indicates weakness, one should use tonics to achieve full recovery. There is no need to be overly concerned with the innate substance quality or excessive phlegm from ginseng and astragalus. However, if there is heat toxin present at the time of initial rupture, one should increase the dosage of detoxifying and cleansing agents. If there are symptoms like back pain radiating to the shoulders and the membrane has ruptured with penetrating heart distress, one&#39;s condition is critical; therefore, it is essential to protect the heart to prevent toxins from penetrating deeper. If toxic qi ascends and the mind feels heavy, prompting nausea, it is advisable to intermittently take heart-protecting powder to remedy this. If there are signs of exterior evils with a red face and the situation is not yet severe, one may take internal decoctions such as Fu Jian San or Shi Xuan San temporarily. In cases where there are no heat toxins or exterior evils, but foul qi affects one’s condition, leading to weak heat and difficulty sleeping, one should administer Ren Shen Huang Qi Tang; if there is much pus, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping, one should use Sheng Yu Tang; if seen are spleen deficiency and weak qi, preventing nourishment and closure, one should apply Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; if kidney deficiency causes unresolved issues and there are afternoon heat and thirst, one should take Ba Wei Wan or Shen Qi Wan. In urgent situations where there is no time to make pills, one may drink a strong decoction. Prevention and urgent care are both essential. If one focuses solely on superficial treatments using medicines for external applications and muscle regeneration, the closure may happen too quickly, causing toxins to attack internally, or a new abscess could occur nearby, or severe symptoms may suddenly arise after healing, leading to a possible serious outcome. Thus, prioritizing internal treatment over external remedies is important. </p>
<p>Injuries lead to pain, whereas qi damage results in swelling. If pain occurs before the swelling, it indicates blood injury; if the swelling precedes the pain, it indicates qi injury. Both swelling and pain suggest injuries to both qi and blood, which stem from disharmony of the organs and cannot be adjusted by external treatments alone.&quot;<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ancient method of garlic moxibustion and fermented soybean cakes should only be used for external injuries that have become sores. For internal onset, if there is pain, moxibustion should be applied until the pain subsides; if there is no pain, moxibustion should be applied until pain is felt, then stop. Early detection and early moxibustion are preferable. For one or two days, ten moxibustions will yield ten recoveries; for three or four days, ten moxibustions will yield seven recoveries; for five or six days, ten moxibustions will yield four recoveries; after seven days, moxibustion should not be performed. Other methods such as puncturing or topical treatments can be used as appropriate, especially if there is significant toxicity present. </p>
<p>When the toxin of carbuncles or sores has formed, it is advisable to release it to expedite the accumulation of pus. Once pus has formed, its condition should be assessed based on its maturity and depth for needling. If the swelling is high and soft, it arises from the blood vessels; if the swelling is lower and hard, it arises from the tendons; if the color of the meat has not changed, it is attached to the bone. If the area feels hot upon palpation, there is pus; if it does not feel hot, there is no pus.

If the vital energy is weak, one must first replenish it before needling the pus; then the symptoms will subside. If the wound is intensely infected and there is darkened flesh inside, one should strengthen the spleen and stomach internally and apply single babaodou ointment externally, allowing the darkened area to gradually lower and the reddened area to gradually rise.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is pus and flesh has rotted, and swelling and pain persist, there must be tendons or barriers within; it is necessary to draw it out again and urgently tonify the spleen and stomach. For cases without pain, simply using tonifying medicine may help gather the essence. If one carelessly applies needles or knives, causing the flesh to bleed and not stopping, it is immediately critical. The needles should be made of horse bits and iron.</p>
<p>The vital energy and blood of the human body disperse in warmth and coagulate in cold. When exposed to cold and coolness, the pores become blocked, qi condenses, and blood stasis occurs, preventing old flesh from decomposing and new flesh from forming, leading toxins to attack internally, making recovery difficult, and in severe cases, ending in stagnation. It is essential to separate the internal yang and yin with medicine, and to apply external treatments that address both aspects, creating a dual pressure from inside and outside, allowing the medicine&#39;s essence to connect harmoniously. </p>
<p>For pure yang conditions, take Huanglian Decoction or similar cooling and detoxifying drinks internally, and apply Yiyang San externally; for mixed yin and yang conditions, take Tuoli Xiaoduo San internally and apply Yinyang San externally; for pure yin conditions, take Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with ginger and fuzi brewed in wine internally, and apply Yiyin San externally.</p>

Pain before they rupture indicates heat toxin and constipation, so Huanglian Decoction or detoxifying soup should be used internally. For pus-producing pain, it should be drained, and for swollen pus and pain, it should be punctured. If after rupture the pus has come out and pain recurs, it indicates deficiency. For qi deficiency, take Four Gentlemen Decoction with additional danggui and astragalus; for blood deficiency, take Four Substance Decoction with ginseng and astragalus; for both qi and blood deficiency, take Tuoli Yiqi Decoction; for spleen deficiency, take Tuoli Hezhong Decoction; for kidney deficiency, take Shenqi Pills.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Two to three faintings are bearable; four to five are fatal. Wash the medicine to clear the qi and blood. When pus and blood are gathered, it relies on warm vinegar applied to rotten flesh day and night, or on detoxifying powder, meat broth; for cold sores that are white, a decoction of dried mugwort is also good. Plasters that are too hot can quickly shrink small sores and abscesses, as they aim to induce warmth outward. However, if a large poison initially appears, using them can lead to blockage and stagnation, causing significant trouble. After it has ruptured, only white wax ointment, Taiyi ointment, or water powder ointment should be used externally to prevent breaking open from wind or cold. </p>
<p>For women, regulating blood and relieving stagnation is primary. During menstrual blockage or after a rupture when menstrual blood reappears, if the affected area is hard and unbroken, without swelling or pain, it is ominous. Children mainly experience maternal toxins or possibly food-induced heat; hence, the medicine should be slightly cooling. For those who are constitutionally weak or have suffered long-term illnesses, the main treatment should still focus on tonifying and supporting the qi, blood, spleen, and stomach. </p>
<p>When both pulse and signs are hot, detoxify internally before rupture; after it has ruptured, detoxify the residue. When both pulse and signs are weak, detoxify the residue before rupture; after it has ruptured, tonify the interior to treat the sores so that other symptoms naturally subside. Sores are the root, while the disease is the manifestation. If the disease strikes urgently and the vital energy is strong, focus temporarily on treating the manifestation; if the disease is mild and the vital energy is weak, only treat the root. The heart connects to all orifices, and the organs are enveloped in a single membrane; if worry or fright enters the heart, a rupture of this membrane will surely lead to death. It is excellent to frequently add Poria cocos and Polygala root to the medicine.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The consumption of rich foods can lead to severe carbuncles. Indulging in spicy and rich flavors, consuming roasted and fatty meats, and accidentally eating carrion animals can accumulate toxins within the body, leading to sudden outbreaks. Additionally, sudden exposure to strong winds, dense fog, extreme heat, or severe cold, along with the noxious energies of nature invading the meridians, can provoke these toxins and cause eruptions. Sometimes, exposure to toxic gases from dead animals, snakes, or insects can lead to rapid deterioration. </p>
<p>Initially, the onset may cause sudden pain from contact with clothing, or it can develop into blisters from scratching eczema, starting as a small sore that can be deadly within a day or two, more toxic than boils. </p>
<p>Carbuncles can appear in various locations; they are slower to manifest on the shoulders, back, or waist but are most urgent when they occur on the head, face, ears, nose, mouth, roots of the tongue, lips, or between the bones of the hands and feet. If they develop on the legs, often there are red streaks leading to the navel; if they occur on the arms, red streaks often extend to the heart; if they appear on the lips or inside the mouth, red streaks may reach the throat, making them particularly difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Immediate medical attention is necessary. The affected area should be pricked with a needle to draw out blood and release the toxic gases to preserve life.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those with a clear heart and spirit, if afflicted by toxic boils entering the heart, will experience confusion, dry mouth, restlessness, and a state resembling drunkenness, with vomiting that is unpredictable—this is a dangerous condition. For those with substantial vitality, use the Detox Pill to resolve myriad ailments, brewing a decoction of huanglian and danggui; for those lacking vitality, use a decoction of Guxiong and Danggui, adding fuling, fushen, yuanzhi, and lotus meat for clarity. If toxins ascend and attack the heart, for those who vomit, the Heart Protecting Powder is recommended; if someone has vomited after taking the Saimeidan, this should also be treated. For those feeling dazed and disturbed, unable to sit or lie still, experiencing thirst, bodily pain, and constipation, administer the Loulu Decoction; for those feeling irritable and thirsty, use a decoction of bamboo leaves and huangqi.</p>

<p>Due to irregular emotions of joy and anger, the blood and qi reverse and manifest between the hands and feet, resulting in yellow blisters, which sometimes turn purple-black. There appears a red thread that extends straight up; if it reaches the heart and abdomen, it causes confusion and loss of consciousness.

<p><strong>Treatment of Bone Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from long-standing ulcers that fail to nourish the affected area with qi and blood, leading to rotting over time, with bone exposure. It is advisable to tonify the spleen and stomach to strengthen the vital energy, using formulas like the Ten Herbs Decocted for Overall Reinforcement and Kidney Qi Pills. Externally, one should apply aconite cake for moxibustion or use the scallion steaming method to dispel cold pathogens and nourish the essential qi, leading to the exposure of the bone and closure of the ulcer. If there is a deficiency of kidney qi, the bone gradually swells, and with the passing of time, it may break open and discharge pus. The scallion steaming method should also be employed. If an aggressive treatment is used, it may cause more deficiency of the righteous qi and aggravate the pathogenic factor, leading to frequent mistakes. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and hardness of the hard palate that has persisted for over a year without healing, accompanied by internal heat, fatigue, and thirst, use the Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction and Kidney Qi Pills.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Guidelines on Cold, Heat, and Conditions of the Body</h3>
<p>For conditions such as back boils and furuncles, regardless of size or pain—whether heat or cold is present—if it grows from small to large, swelling to over a foot in size, and is red and hot, one should urgently apply a medicine to contain the redness and swelling, preventing it from spreading. In the center, use a poultice to draw out pus and toxins, facilitating their expulsion. Internally, take herbal remedies to expel the pus and resolve the internal toxins. Wait for the pus to form before carefully creating an opening to let it out, considering the size and depth of the wound. If there is a significant discharge of pus, it is crucial to replenish the body internally. Even if only a small amount of pus is released, further purging is necessary. After expelling the toxins, exercise caution to prevent re-swelling. Pain should subside, and the swelling should diminish; the patient should feel lighter, indicating a favorable recovery. It is essential to regulate diet carefully. If heat and toxins are severe, resulting in excessive thirst, drinking cold water or similar substances may occur; this indicates that toxins are attacking the heart, leading to dry mouth and thirst. In such cases, using heart-qi tonics to nourish the organs will suffice.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Places Where Abscesses Should Not Be Worrying:</strong></p>
<p>The void behind the eyes, the area where the jaw connects to the bone, the hair between the root of the genitals, the junction of the hip and tailbone, the area in front and behind the ear where it connects to the jaw, all of which can lead to abscesses caused by wind and water in the lower abdomen, as well as the hollow just behind the ear under the jaw, and the center of the nose which can also be harmful. However, with various treatments, some may achieve healing. The void behind the eyes is the most dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Boils:</strong></p>
<p>Boils occur on the limbs, presenting as yellow blisters, sometimes purple or black. There is typically an itch followed by pain, beginning with cold sensations and then transitioning to heat. Boils must arise between the hands and feet, manifesting as yellow blisters, which may appear with a purple-black hue, accompanied by a line that runs straight up like a red thread. In urgent situations, one should immediately use a needle at the point where the red line leads to, to pierce and release toxic blood. Then apply medicine such as toad fat and frankincense paste directly on the boil. It is best if the patient feels pain and bleeding during the needling. Otherwise, if the red line extends to the abdomen affecting the heart, it could lead to serious danger. Another method is to drain along the corresponding meridians.<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Source of Sores and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>The prescriptions describe five sources of sores and abscesses: first, climatic factors; second, internal emotional distress; third, bodily weakness leading to external pathogens; fourth, the body&#39;s heat interacting with wind and cold; fifth, consuming fried food, drinking alcohol, and using mineral medicines, all of which generate heat toxins. In summary, these sources do not go beyond three causes. </p>
<p>As for external factors, there are four causes of climatic sores and abscesses: first, excessive heat aiding the heart leads to sores. The classics state: &quot;Sores and rashes arise from the lesser yin.&quot; It also says: &quot;The lesser yin governs the heavens; warm air descends while lung qi ascends, leading to sores and ulcers if severe.&quot; Furthermore, it mentions: &quot;The governance of the lesser yin in its early phases begins with cold, yang qi becomes stagnant, and extreme heat arises, causing both internal and external sores and ulcers.&quot; It also states: &quot;Sores and ulcers arise where the lesser yang prevails.&quot; Additionally, it mentions: &quot;The governance of the lesser yang brings forth windy heat; in the presence of the greater yin, cold arrives at the right time, causing the populace to suffer from internal heat and external abscesses.&quot; Initially, when the climate is excessively warm, the illness manifests as sores in the skin; in the second case, when fire reverses and causes stagnation, the illness manifests as heat trapped above, resulting in sores appearing internally; in the third case, when extreme heat arrives, the populace suffers from pus-filled sores.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p></div>

Furthermore, it is said: When the Lesser Yin governs, if guests dominate, there are sores and ulcers. Again, it is said: The resurgence of the Lesser Yin brings diseases such as rashes, sores, abscesses, and hemorrhoids. It is also said: When fire is excessive, it is labeled as radiant and tumultuous, resulting in abscesses and bleeding. Additionally, it is stated: When fire is trapped, people suffer from sores, abscesses, and swelling. These abscesses are the most severe form of illness. Secondly, cold evils injure the heart, causing sores and ulcers. The texts state: The Sun governs the affairs of Heaven. In the third phase, when cold qi circulates, people suffer from cold reactions and internal heat, resulting in abscesses. The commentary further states: The Sun governs Heaven; when cold prevails excessively, the blood changes within, leading to the development of sores and ulcers, with the illness originating from the heart. It is also stated: The Yang Ming governs the affairs of Heaven. In the fourth phase, when cold rain descends, the people suffer from abscesses and sores. Thirdly, dryness harms the liver, resulting in sores and ulcers. The texts state: When wood does not flourish, it is called &quot;dispersed harmony,&quot; where the upper shang is the same as the regular shang, with illness manifesting as abscesses and swelling due to evil harming the liver.<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a></p></div>

Fourthly, there are sores and abscesses due to dampness. The classics state: Taiyin governs the heavens, where humidity transforms substances; if severe, it results in abscesses behind the body. It is further stated: The victory of Taiyin involves internal confinement of fire, leading to sores inside that spread outward. These four points refer to the seasonal influences of the heavens. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Suwen,&quot; on the essentials of pulse: The Emperor asked: What causes abscesses, swellings, muscle spasms, and bone pain? How can they be treated? Qibo replied: These are swellings from cold and changes from the eight winds. The Emperor asked: How should they be treated? Qibo replied: These are maladies of the four seasons, and thus are cured by addressing what predominates. </p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states in the chapter on abscesses that blood vessels nourish and protect, circulating without rest; they correlate with the stars above and the cycles below. When cold evil invades the meridians, it causes blood to weep; when blood weeps, it cannot flow freely. Without free flow, the protective qi cannot return, resulting in abscesses and swellings.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When cold transforms into heat, heat dominates, leading to decaying flesh; decayed flesh turns into pus. If the pus does not drain, it rots the tendons; if the tendons rot, they injure the bones. When the bones are injured, the marrow depletes. If the bones are hollow and do not drain properly, the blood becomes desiccated and empty, resulting in the tendons, bones, and muscles failing to nourish each other. The meridians collapse and leak, affecting the five organs, which leads to death.</p>
<p>Moreover, the &quot;Theory of Vital Energy and Its Connection to Heaven&quot; states: exertion and sweating in the wind leads to cold-mediated rash; stagnation causes acne. It also mentions: the Yang energy cannot open and close properly. When cold is present, significant deformities arise. If the nourishing energy does not follow, it resists the flesh, resulting in boils and swellings. This is also due to cold evils entering through the gaps left by exhaustion and sweating, as well as the inability of the Yang energy to open and close, leading to prolonged infestations causing boils and swellings. This refers to physical weakness and external invasion, as well as body heat clashing with cold wind.</p>
<p>The treatment should therefore focus on critical methods such as the Ten Essential Scattering Decoction, Five Spice Soup, and Clean Ancient Atractylodes Re-boiled Powder. Regarding internal causes: Chen Wuze states that the occurrence of boils, abscesses, and nodules does not distinguish between deficiency or excess, cold or heat; they all arise from Qi stagnation. The classics say: Qi lodges in the meridians, becoming thick with blood and stagnant, resulting in boils and abscesses. It does not say that heat alone causes boils; rather, they arise from emotions like joy, anger, worry, and thought causing stagnation.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a></p></div>

Regarding internal and external causes: It is mentioned in the classics that the transformation of rich foods can lead to great sores, which is like holding emptiness. In the eastern region, where fish and salt are abundant, the people consume fish and have a fondness for salt, finding contentment in their life and joy in their food. Fish is hot, and salt overcomes blood, hence the people exhibit dark, loose skin, and their ailments manifest as carbuncles. Additionally, there are those who consume elixirs made from realgar and stones, which is also a variant of rich foods. Li Dongyuan states: The transformation of rich foods stems from excessive flavors, the nurturing energy not aligning, thus conflicting with the essence of the flesh. The nourishing energy refers to the energy of the stomach. When food enters the stomach, it first moves to the spleen, then arrives at the lungs, from there it circulates through the hundred vessels, subsequently reaching the skin and hair, first traversing the yang pathways and then returning to the five organs and six bowels, thus forming the energy in units.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nowadays, the wealthy do not understand moderation. They indulge in rich foods like wine and fatty lamb, mixing it with heavy flavors, which over time leads to an excess. Such rich substances are the essence of yang, but they cannot walk the empty pathway and instead move towards the yin, resulting in an overwhelming dampness. This causes the offspring to overpower the mother; fire thus flourishes, and with the humidity and heat in abundance, they inevitably harm the kidneys. If one is careless in sexual activity, it depletes their essence water. When water is scarce, it rises due to transformation by dampness, causing sores to emerge primarily on the back and head; this is the most severe form of major sores. If toxins arise from the lungs, or parts of the spleen and stomach, they are of lesser severity. If they emerge from other channels, they are even less so. The toxins of damp heat lead to decay wherever they settle. Therefore, the classics say that the transformation brought by rich grains leads to major sores; it is like holding a vessel that is empty, which can receive anything. The method to treat major sores must involve expelling the excess vital energy. In terms of root and branch, the initial illness is the root; without using bitter and cold medications, which should be the focus, one cannot alleviate the suffering and pain. Just as Dong Yuan treated Yuan Haowen and Dan Xi treated an elderly woman&#39;s brain boils, both used good wine, hence employing the method of Three Yellow and Da Huang wine for treatment. Similarly, remedies like pus-dispersing powders and Angelica powders are effective.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Additionally, if there is a condition caused by excessive effort in the living space, leading to an accumulation of vital energy, this is also not due to external or internal factors. The treatment should focus on nourishing the internal deficiency, avoiding the use of aromatic medications that deplete true yin and exacerbate evil heat. Medicines for treatment, such as Neiguhuangqi Decoction and Shenxiaotuli Powder, are to be employed. The classics say: &quot;The five organs are affected by internal heat, leading to abscesses in the six bowels.&quot; It also states: &quot;If the six bowels are not harmonized, they will form abscesses.&quot; Furthermore, it notes: &quot;All pains, itching, and sores relate to the heart.&quot; When the lungs overpower the liver, it leads to abscesses. If the kidneys transmit cold to the liver, it results in swelling and shortness of breath. If the spleen sends cold to the liver, it causes swelling and muscle cramps. These changes in the organs and bowels are also considered internal factors. Dongyuan states: &quot;The theory of vital energy communicating with heaven suggests that when the nourishing energy is obstructed, it goes against the flesh and leads to abscesses.&quot; It also mentions: &quot;Changes from rich foods can lead to severe boils and create a sense of deficiency.&quot; The theory of yin and yang indicates that dampness from the earth, when affecting the body, harms the skin, flesh, and tendons. This implies that external dampness injures the body and obstructs the flow of nourishing energy. The nourishing and protective energies are governed by the nourishing energy itself, which is also related to the gastric and operational energies.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of vitality is fundamental; when it goes against its natural course, it becomes damaged by dampness, leading to lesions and sores. The changes brought on by rich and fatty foods indicate that excessive indulgence causes the vital essence to reverse its flow, congealing within the meridians and resulting in sores. This malevolent force is neither found on the surface nor within, but rather lies in the channels where the illness manifests. This aligns with what is stated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; indicating that the conditions arise due to the reversal of nourishing qi. </p>
<p>Upon examining various theories about sores and lesions, many mention the clash of two types of heat, leading to suppuration; some solely refer to heat causing pus; others state that dampness produces sores, transforming cold into heat that leads to pus. All these are sources of lesions. In the observed cases, medicinal herbs should be used in accordance with the principles discussed, also considering the differentiation between yin and yang conditions. First, one must drain the nourishing qi since its reversal fuels fire, combining dampness and heat, which deteriorates the flesh and leads to pus and blood. This treatment method is secondary; it is advisable to take materials that can be compared. </p>
<p>In a year, when extreme heat does not exceed the summer, all things do not rot. It is during the autumn dampness that decay occurs and flourishes. Examining the body, when a febrile illness is present and only manifests outward heat without damaging the flesh, the reasoning becomes clear. If the root and branch are not addressed and the malevolent qi is not subdued, one who understands one principle can be considered a master craftsman.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Difference Between Boils and Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: When the nourishing and protective energies are obstructed within the meridians, the blood stagnates and cannot flow. When it does not flow, the defensive qi becomes blocked, leading to heat. When the heat becomes intense and does not cease, it overwhelms the flesh, causing it to decay, which then results in pus. However, it does not penetrate to the bone marrow, nor does it cause desiccation or harm the five organs; hence, it is called a boil. When the heat energy is exceedingly strong and descends into the muscles, causing the tendons and marrow to wither, internally connecting with the five organs, and when the flesh and bone beneath the carbuncle show no signs of life, it is termed a carbuncle. A carbuncle presents as a hardened skin area above, resembling the hide of an ox; whereas a boil has a thinner, more lustrous skin surface—this is its characteristic. The &quot;Gui Yi Fang&quot; states: The pain of a boil only manifests on the skin and erupts as if fire were burning straw. Initially, it may be the size of a millet grain, enlarging to the size of a palm in three to five days, or to the size of a bowl in five to seven days, making it easy to treat. However, if the swelling is cold, causing thirst and reversal of qi, treatment becomes difficult. Carbuncles may appear similar to small sores; upon touch, they cause deep pain, with slight elevation around the edges like an orange peel, displaying a faint red color without significant discharge of pus, resulting in incessant pain and difficulty breathing after seven or eight days. If a swelling initially rises high and then suddenly flattens after five to seven days, this indicates an internal attack. Furthermore, it is noted that boils and carbuncles are divided into three categories: superficial toxic qi afflicts the bowels, while deep toxic qi affects the organs. The severity of the toxic qi and its movement through the meridians can vary in depth and degree.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All the internal organs are affected by its poison, making it difficult to treat. It is crucial to urgently address the lesions wherever they erupt, regardless of whether they are severe or mild. The swellings are pronounced, tender, and painful, merely on the surface of the skin, with extreme heat and fullness, and may have itching or soreness, with no other alarming signs. Initially, use warm medicines to calm the energy, then use methods to drain pus and open the abscess.</p>
<p>The treatment for these lesions, referred to as calming energy, involves medications similar to rhinoceros horn decoction, utilizing ingredients like rhinoceros horn, forsythia, rhubarb, licorice, angelica, and cinnamon, all of which promote expulsion. The method of opening abscesses involves using needles, with soapberries as the main agent, supported by licorice, chuanxiong, and frankincense, which are also medications for expelling toxins. However, the methods from Jie Gu and Dongyuan that promote expulsion and open the abscess are more reliable.</p>
<p>For sores that arise anywhere on the body, regardless of size, if they occur on the back and extend one, two, or three feet, with thick, dark, purplish skin that is high and swollen, accompanied by internal pain like being stabbed by a needle, there is a heaviness in the limbs and pain in the chest as well. If such lesions occur elsewhere, they may be bearable, but if they are located in areas of deficiency or near the tendons and bones, if the pus and poison have not yet erupted, they may damage the tendons and bones. Flesh that is damaged and becomes sore belongs to the deep-seated toxic energy of the internal organs, with excessive energy being hard and solid, and thus it is not suitable for gentle treatment. The internal organs must be fortified, and the skin must be allowed to expel the toxins, so as to equalize the pus. It is essential to use medications that support the solid organ energy inside and drain the pus and harmonize energy outside; these conditions differ significantly from the superficial toxins of the lesions, and should not be treated as if they were the same condition.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All kinds of swellings, when first noticed as a high swelling that suddenly flattens in five to seven days, indicate an internal attack. It is urgent to use internal dispersing and nourishing decoctions to fill and strengthen the organs; the greatest fear is breaking through the membrane, as that results in death. Lou Quanshan states: If the evil of a sore is superficial, it is merely stagnation and obstruction in the meridians, thus treating it externally. Therefore, when it first appears, there is external heat, and the affected area swells like a bowl or basin, causing pain. In severe cases, it may even want to sink, but due to the solid righteous qi internally, it refuses to do so; hence, it may lead to constipation or thirst and reversal as resistance. As a result, the marrow never becomes exhausted, and the five organs remain unharmed. </p>
<p>If the evil of the carbuncle is deep, it clogs and obstructs internally, connecting to the five organs without attacking the exterior specifically. Thus, the body may not exhibit fever, and the affected area may be pain-free and not swollen. In severe situations, the voice may become hoarse, the spirit may weaken, and the eyes may appear dark and small, with the fingers swollen and black like ink, often resulting in death. </p>
<p>The treatment method for an initial carbuncle should primarily follow the ancient methods: disperse what is outside, purge what is inside, use fire for cauterization, and apply medicine topically. If there is no pus formed yet, it must be dissipated; if pus has formed, it must be quickly allowed to drain. For the initial appearance of a carbuncle, the formula &quot;Guili Fang&quot; should be the main focus, nourishing and filling the organs to prevent the sinking evil from spreading. Externally, use fire to draw the evil out, ensuring that the points are directed and not chaotic, then it can turn from death to life, transforming omens of misfortune into good fortune.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the present day, the practice of surgery does not distinguish between abscesses and sores. For instance, in a case where heat is declared and toxins are expelled, externally, five spices are used to deplete the energy, and internally, rhubarb is employed to drain the blood. Ultimately, they cannot comprehend the fault of their remedies—what a pity! The &quot;Collection of Evidence&quot; states: the name of abscesses and sores. Although there are more than twenty symptoms, the essence boils down to two: yin and yang. Those arising from yang are abscesses, heat, and fullness; those arising from yin are sores, cold, and emptiness. Therefore, when it arises from yang, the skin is thin, red, swollen, and often has several pepper-like spots that are painful. When it arises from yin, the skin is thick and pale, the swelling is hard resembling the hide of a cow, and it is not painful. There are also cases of yin within yang, appearing to be heat but not true heat, although swollen, it is both solid and void, red but not dry, desiring pain yet having no pus, initially floating then dissipating, with external fullness and decaying flesh.<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Within Yin, there is Yang, appearing cold yet not truly cold, not swollen though real, slightly dry, with pus causing pain; externally it may not seem intense, yet internally it is bothersome. Within Yang, there is Yin; such individuals are often plump, their flesh tight yet internally weak. In contrast, those with Yin within Yang tend to be thin, with loose flesh yet a strong interior. There are cases where Yang transforms into Yin, often caused by excessive cooling agents from herbal medicine; and cases where Yin transforms into Yang, typically due to abrupt heat treatments. However, when Yang changes to Yin, the symptoms are more numerous, and it can still return to Yang, thus leading to a higher chance of survival; while Yin turning into Yang shows fewer symptoms, making it incapable of reverting to Yin, resulting in higher mortality. Occasionally, there are survivors, due to the physician coincidentally adhering to the principles, which happens one in a hundred occasions. Observing this, boils and sores only vary in the depth of Yin and Yang, and the distinction between internal and external deficiencies or strengths, but there is no difference in size. The &quot;Essentials&quot; claim that lesions two to five inches are boils, and those five inches to one foot are sores, which is incorrect!</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse is deep and solid, with heat and irritability, and there is no external scorching red pain, the evil is deeply internal and should be cleared to eliminate its source. A floating, large, and rapid pulse, with heat and swelling externally, requires initially relieving the interior, for fear that the evil will enter inside. If the pulse is neither deep nor floating, and there are no internal or external symptoms, it suggests involvement in the meridians and should be harmonized with nourishing and protective energy. If the pulse is rapid but there is no fever, pus is present internally.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Swollen abscesses are tight and raised, accompanied by fever and chills, or localized pain, indicating a boil or sore; ulcers are characterized by qi and blood stagnation causing pain or the presence of external cold. </p>
<p>Stagnation refers to an abscess resulting from excess qi or qi obstruction; ulcers are due to blood deficiency and correspond to the disease pulse.</p>
<p>Shortness indicates that the swelling is due to a deficiency of original qi; ulcers signify a severe deficiency and require replenishment.</p>
<p>Mild swelling suggests a deficiency, with a gradual response to medication being ideal; a mild and even ulcer also indicates deficiency and aligns with the disease pulse.</p>
<p>Slow swelling indicates cold or deficiency; diminished pulse in the wrist suggests little blood; ulcers imply deficiency, where qi and blood cannot nourish the sore, also associated with external cold.</p>
<p>Gentle swelling is treatable; larger, gentler swellings indicate deficiency; a mild and stagnant ulcer heals since its pulse corresponds and the stomach qi is abundant.</p>
<p>Deep swelling suggests the presence of evil qi; an ulcer indicates residual toxic material within. A deep pulse corresponds to phlegm in the chest.</p>
<p>Hidden swelling indicates the presence of Yang pathogenic factors within Yin; ulcers are indicative of inner erosion where Yang is hidden within, leading to difficult treatment due to infiltrating fluids.</p>
<p>Deficiency in swelling calls for internal nurturing; once ulcer pus is drained, substantial tonification of qi and blood is advisable.</p>
<p>Weak swelling indicates inadequate original qi and necessitates internal support; ulcers correspond to the disease pulse and also require tonification.</p>
<p>Consolidation in swelling suggests the accumulation of pathogenic qi; if an ulcer gradually becomes uniform, healing occurs; if not regulated, it poses a risk.</p>
<p>Rapid swelling suggests heat and advancement of the disease; ulcers reflect unrelenting heat—gradual progression leads to death, while gradual regression results in recovery.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dividing the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The human body has meridians, just as geography has boundaries. To treat illness without understanding the meridians is like trying to catch a thief without knowing the boundaries; how can one avoid the blame for errors and misdeeds? Moreover, among the twelve meridians of the hands and feet, there are differences in the amounts of blood and qi. For example, the hand’s lesser yang sanjiao, lesser yin kidney, and greater yin spleen have more qi and less blood; the hand’s greater yin heart covering, greater yang small intestine, and foot’s greater yang bladder have more blood and less qi; while the hand’s greater yang large intestine and foot’s greater yang stomach have both more qi and more blood. This is the broad comparison. Those with more blood and less qi are easier to heal, while those with more qi and less blood are harder to treat. In meridians rich in qi, one can promote its flow, whereas in meridians rich in blood, one can disperse it; one must not cling to a singular aspect.</p>
<p>For the head: at the top, we find the foot&#39;s greater yang, lesser yin, and governor meridian; at the corners of the head above the ears is the lesser yang; running straight down from the forehead to the nose is the governor meridian; the second line measures one inch and five points from the foot&#39;s greater yang; open two sides for the third line of the head, with the third line corresponding to the foot&#39;s lesser yang.<a id="trans-244p" href="#orig-244p" class="marker">[244p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Reality and Illusion</strong></p>
<p>In cases of sores, ulcers, and suppuration, where swelling and toxins permeate, it is crucial to distinguish between reality and illusion. Moreover, the ill state of the body under virtual circumstances is hard to restore, while the real condition is easy to purge. The methods of reinforcement and purging should not be used lightly. A slight deviation could lead to significant consequences. </p>
<p>However, distinctions between reality and illusion are numerous: there is the virtual and real concerning sores, organs, and blood; there are conditions of excess above and deficiency below, as well as true deficiency and false excess that must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>For instance, when swelling is hardened and pus thick, that signifies real sores; when swelling is soft and slow with thin pus, it indicates the virtual aspect. If there are symptoms like diarrhea, rumbling in the intestines, inability to eat, vomiting at irregular times, cold hands and feet, weak pulse, cold skin, spontaneous urination, or difficulty urinating, with smooth bowel movements, an inaudible voice, and a lack of spirit, these all indicate the deficiency of the organs; while hard stools, scant urine, normal appetite, abdominal distension, chest and diaphragm pressure, joint pain, bitter mouth and dry throat, restlessness and excessive thirst, fever, strong pulse, and dull spirit, all indicate the excess of the organs.</p>
<p>If the pus is clear and thin, the sore does not close, the swelling is not red, the skin is cold, and there is spontaneous sweating and pallor, this shows a deficiency of qi and blood; but if the swelling appears red, with chills or heat and pain, hot skin, thick and sticky pus, and heaviness of the head, it indicates the excess of qi and blood. </p>
<p>Headaches with nasal congestion, red eyes, heart palpitations, throat discomfort, mouth sores, excessive thirst and cold drinks, talking in sleep and grinding teeth indicate an excess above; while slippery essence that cannot be contained, spontaneous bowel movements, heavy lower back and legs, and unsettled sleep indicate a deficiency below.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a></p></div>

It is also said: if vital energy is depleted, it leads to deficiency; if pathogenic energy is strong, it leads to fullness. Furthermore, it is stated: all pain indicates fullness, while itchiness indicates deficiency. Additionally, if the pulse is strong and rapid, it indicates fullness; if it is weak and soft, it indicates deficiency. For deficiency, one should tonify it, harmonize the energy, and open the channels; for fullness, one should drain it, clearing the pathways to self-guide the energy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The texts state: If a person has excessive vigor and blood, with a fullness in the collaterals that stagnates and becomes festering, one must drain this to relieve the overwhelming heat. Conversely, if a person has little appetite and thoughts, with weak spirit and a deficiency in the collaterals, causing cold to congeal and lead to festering, one should nourish them to restore the vital energy. This is the fundamental principle for treating deficiencies and excesses. </p>
<p>When sores and abscesses cease to hurt, and when one knows the taste of food, the pulse and symptoms are both relaxed; if they are relaxed, the treatment can proceed from a place of fundamental balance, using harmonious medicinals, and healing will surely follow. However, if the pulse is full, hot, swollen, causing agitation with alternating cold and heat, both pulse and symptoms are excess, and only intense agents like sodium sulfate and yellow medicine can remove it; using harmonious medicines in this case would not work. </p>
<p>If abscesses are swollen without rupture, or if the pus is clear and thin, or if there is diarrhea with rumbling intestines, lack of appetite, or vomiting at all times, or coldness in the hands and feet, this indicates a deficiency in both pulse and symptoms; only a strong nourishing approach can stabilize the condition, and using harsh purgative agents would be ineffective.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Internal Dissolution</strong></p>
<p>For the condition of boils and carbuncles, which may appear in various places, it is essential to promote internal dissolution at the initial stage when redness, swelling, and gathering occur. This can be achieved by administering herbs that invigorate qi, activate blood circulation, detoxify, and reduce swelling. One must carefully consider the depth, size, and locations of the affliction, as well as the condition of the pulse—whether it is weak or strong. </p>
<p>If the boils manifest on the back of the head, waist, neck, or buttocks, they belong to the Taiyang channel, and suitable herbs include Huang Lian and Qiang Huo. For boils located on the back and sides, which are closer to the Shaoyang channel, herbs such as Chai Hu and formulas like Bai Du San and Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin are appropriate. If the condition is intense and the pulse is strong, remedies such as Lou Lu Tang, Nei Shu Huang Lian Tang, and Zhuidu Wan should be used to promote relief. </p>
<p>In cases of qi deficiency, the main herbs are Ren Shen and Huang Qi; for blood deficiency, Xiong Gui is primary, supplemented with detoxifying herbs. Depending on the distinct characteristics, guiding herbs must be directed to the site of the disease. In the six channels, if there are boils, each of the five channels should adjust according to their respective elemental qualities of cold, warmth, qi, and blood to either tonify or purge. However, the Shaoyang channel, though termed as having excess qi and deficient blood, is deficient in both qi and blood; thus, the treatment follows the same principles as for qi and blood deficiency.</p>
<p>Various herbs such as (plant) Lu, She Gan, Chuan Shan Jia, Jin Yin Hua, Xia Ku Cao, Chan Su, Lian Qiao, Di Ding, Shu Nian Zi, and Mu Bie Zi, are classified as internal dissolution medicines. Formulas like Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin, Nei Xiao Wan, Zuo Mu Yin Zi, Niu Jiao Yin Zi, Che Ao San, Fan Hun Dan, and Xiao Du Yin are recognized as internal dissolution recipes. However, it is often overlooked that balancing tonification and purging, regulating cold and heat, and normalizing qi and blood can enable internal resolution. For external application, using Zige Tang for washing, along with powders and plasters, also aids in harmonizing qi and blood, leading to a reduction in swelling and heat.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Internal Replenishment</strong></p>
<p>When a carbuncle has formed and the blood and qi are deficient, or the evil qi is deep-set and scattered, it cannot rise prominently or easily discharge pus; sometimes after rupture, there may be little pus, or the pus may be thin and clear, or the area may be hard and not softening; or even if pus is obtained, the root may be red, swollen, and enlarged; or if the toxic qi does not emerge, the wound may not close, swelling is not red, and there are tubercle-like forms without pus, all indicating a deficiency of qi and blood. Once qi and blood are deficient, combined with the evils of the six excesses leading to various symptoms, internal replenishment must be employed to expel the toxic heat from the body&#39;s surface for recovery. Medicines for internal replenishment primarily focus on tonifying drugs, assisted by drugs that invigorate blood and dispel evils, or by aromatic drugs to move through stagnation, or by warming drugs to counteract wind and cold. Generally, essential medicines include those for expelling toxins and dispersing stagnation, such as Decoction to Release Toxin, Decoction to Disperse Stagnation, Small Decoction to Release Toxin, and the Ten Xuan Decoction, but adjustment according to the situation is key. For those with qi stagnation in winter, the Five Spice and Forsythia Decoction; for the weak, reduce Da Huang. For those who should avoid cold medicines, use the Small Five Spice Decoction. If the form and pulse are strong and the pus is thick, do not use tonifying drugs; instead, consider something like the Honeysuckle Pill. If large amounts of pus are discharged, necrotic tissue is removed, and swelling has subsided, one should use large doses of Astragalus, Ginseng, Angelica, and Atractylodes to nourish qi and blood, promoting the easy growth of new flesh.<a id="trans-257p" href="#orig-257p" class="marker">[257p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a sore or swelling first appears and seems to have a head but has not yet developed, it is appropriate to apply a warm medicated poultice to draw out the heat and toxins, akin to the idea of drying up fire. If the swelling arises high and shows redness around the edges, it is advisable to crush cold herbs and apply a paste to counter the heat&#39;s force, expelling its evil, akin to extinguishing fire. Generally, the method of poulticing aims to alleviate swelling and toxins, open up the blood vessels, and address the interplay of cold and heat, all with the goal of preventing pus formation. For swellings with thick skin, apply medicated soft cloth or paper and wait until the medicine dries before changing it. For swellings with thin skin, use loose gauze or thin paper to apply the medicine, and replace it before it dries. After pus has broken, apply a warm ointment to nourish and regenerate the flesh, focusing on eliminating bad odors, expelling harmful fluids, removing dead tissue, and promoting healthy flesh, relying entirely on the power of the warm medicated ointment.<a id="trans-258p" href="#orig-258p" class="marker">[258p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Certain conditions may arise due to the influence of wind, cold, heat, and foul qi, which affect one differently in the four seasons. One should be flexible and adopt suitable methods. For heat, one should use Sanhuang Powder; if the heat is severe, Sanxiao Powder is recommended. For wind, add Qianghuo and Fangfeng. If energy is stagnant, add Muxiang; if cold is constraining, add Gui. If there is foul qi, it is advisable to use fragrant medicines for fumigation; for swollen and tender areas, remove Biji. </p>
<p>When applying the medication, check the hairless areas for sweat beads. This signifies that the blood vessels are opening up, the heat toxin is dissipating, the redness is gradually shrinking, the pus is draining and pain is relenting, and the condition is improving. The skin and hair should become moist and lively, and the flesh should regenerate well; however, if there is slight necrosis at the abscess, do not use knives or scissors. </p>
<p>If the medicine does not promote sweating, necrosis will likely spread and become extensive. After pus has drained, it is essential to compress the area to eliminate lingering toxins, allowing them to exit through the sore. Use detoxifying plaster to draw out poison, and if necrotic flesh remains, use Jinbaogao. Following the removal of dead tissue, if the area is compressed, the qi and blood will circulate, and new flesh will grow easily.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a></p></div>

<p>The method of the Guo family is as follows: if there is a head sore or ulcer, promptly use a piece of vermilion ointment about the size of a yellow bean, placing it on the sore. Then cover it with a soft adhesive plaster for protection; the sore will surely break. If the sore has a dark purple appearance, apply a poison-dissolving poultice externally to trap the toxic gas. If the sore has a bright red appearance, use a clarified ointment for application. The next day, use a firm jade tool to open the sore, then use a tight jade tool to remove the necrotic tissue, cleaning it slightly, and afterwards use a gentle jade tool to promote flesh growth. Collectively, these are called the &quot;blue and gold jade tools.&quot; </p>
<p>Regardless of the number of days, simply wait until the necrotic tissue is completely removed and apply the ointment. Once the pus has entirely drained and the flesh is smooth, you may then apply the medicinal paste for closing the sore. Following this method allows one to avoid the pain of knives and needles. Similarly, if there is a boil without a head, wait for the pus to form, then puncture it with a needle and proceed according to the method to achieve the desired effect. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ancient scholars discussed that when sore swellings begin to appear and do not subside after one or two days, one must use decoction or water to wash and irrigate them. For swellings on the limbs, soak them; for those in the waist, abdomen, and back, wash them; for those in the lower parts, submerge them. This is all aimed at unblocking the pores and facilitating blood flow to eliminate stagnation. The &quot;Collection of Proven Experiences&quot; states: For the washing method, use two taels of medicine and three sheng of water, decoct to one and a half sheng, strain out the residue, and using clean cloth or new cotton, dip it in while hot to apply to the affected area. Gradually, one will feel relief, then continue washing; if it cools, urgently replace it, and be cautious not to use it cold! For swollen sores, wash with purple kueh decoction five to seven times a day. After each wash, pat dry and check if there are white grains the size of rice on the top of the sore; puncture them with five ashes ointment, apply old skin powder to the sore, and then use large iron hoop powder mixed with water to encircle the swollen red areas, and apply proper iron hoop powder mixed with water to the sore opening. Before the next wash, remove the old medicine. Each time you wash, replace it with new medicine as before. For ulcers, use pig trotter decoction to wash once or twice a day, still using large iron hoop powder as before for encircling the sore, applying detoxifying and purging medicines at the sore opening. After necrotic flesh is removed, change it every two to three days, and it can be replaced with growth-promoting ointment. The efficacy of washing helps initially release the evil qi and may cause it to subside; when it has formed, washing then unblocks the pores and harmonizes the blood vessels, drawing out heat and toxins from the inside to the outside, making deep issues superficial and large issues small. Swelling that extends, washing helps to reduce; dark purple hues become red and life-filled with washing.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a></p></div>

If a wound is cold and stagnant, preventing closure, wash it with a strong decoction of northern mugwort, and fumigate it with pine resin and rabbit fur. The washing medicines can be used in conjunction with iron hoop powder. </p>
<p>Generally, moxibustion, burning, and soaking each have their suitable applications. For abscesses, moxibustion is preferred over burning, while for carbuncles, burning is favored over moxibustion. For cysts or malignant tumors, soaking is advised. If the skin is swollen and smooth, it is suitable to open it with a needle to release the toxins. Recognizing it as an abscess, quickly apply a mugwort stick about the size of a mung bean and perform moxibustion with two hundred strong sessions. After moxibustion, if you feel a hot pain, it indicates that the fire energy has penetrated, driving the toxic energy out with the fire. </p>
<p>If the wound itches, mix light fermented soybean paste with pepper, ginger, salt, and onion, pound it into a cake about three qian thick, and place it on the wound for moxibustion. If it feels too hot, remove it, then replace it. The cake should be changed frequently. If the wound pains, re-perform moxibustion; stronger and more frequent is better. If it has already formed pus, do not moxibust, but open it with a needle instead. </p>
<p>Upon first noticing a sore on the back, which feels slightly itchy and painful, recognize it as a back attack. Take pure soil and water, mix and pound into a cake one inch in diameter and two fen thick, place it on the wound, and perform moxibustion with the mugwort stick, changing out each stick after use. For wounds the size of grains of rice, perform moxibustion seventy-seven times. For those the size of coins, continue without stopping day and night until healing is achieved. </p>
<p>For stubborn fistulous abscesses that do not respond to other methods, take a grub, trimming off both ends, place it on the mouth of the sore and apply moxibustion, changing it out after seven sessions, no more than seven must yield results. Additionally, moxibustion can be applied using the same method with a fire-moving bug, and results have been consistently effective, though the technique is mostly kept secret and often not passed down from fathers to sons.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a></p></div>

<p><em>Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines</em> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>Swelling and Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Collection of Experience,&quot; the methods for treating ulcers are categorized into three names: &quot;boil&quot;, &quot;abscess&quot;, and &quot;carbuncle&quot;. A boil appears as an initial raised bump, red and lacking a defined base, visible on the skin, typically a width of one or two inches, with slight pain. After several days, it softens, the thin skin peels away, and clear fluid begins to emerge, eventually rupturing and discharging pus. If it does not break, a detoxifying poultice or needle can be applied to draw the poison out; once pus is discharged, it heals.</p>
<p>An abscess initially appears red and swollen, raised without a defined head; it is treated by puncturing it with a hot needle, which causes it to disperse. If it does not disperse, the needle should penetrate deeper, and it can be considerable in size, about three or four inches wide. Symptoms may include fever, chills, thirst, or in some cases, absence of fever with pulling pain. After four to five days, pressing it will reveal that it has softened.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This indicates that the toxic gas is shallow. In spring and summer, it is advisable to use Fangfeng Baidu San combined with scallions, ginger, and jujubes, decocted for consumption. In autumn and winter, omit ginger, jujubes, and scallions, and add Mu Xiang. For areas above halfway the body, add (the herb) Lou, and for areas below, it is advisable to add She Gan. For early conditions, simply use the powder. Alternatively, one may use Zhui Du Wan, Fan Hun Dan, or Fu Yuan Tong Qi San in small doses. If pus has formed, use a beryllium needle to open it, or use Ti Zhen Wan to bite it open. </p>
<p>Another type shows no change in skin color but is slightly swollen, with internal muscle pain, especially severe at night, along with fever, chills, and thirst; this indicates deep heat toxins, also known as abscesses, which can harm muscles, veins, and bone marrow. Over time, palpation reveals a softening heart; when pus forms, use fire to cauterize and drain the large pus, applying external Pou Du Ru Xiang Gao and taking internal soothing medicines. At the onset, quickly use a large needle to puncture the firm swelling to disperse it. Abscesses initially emerge as white grains the size of millet, accompanied by itching and pain. Touching them causes noticeable pain; this is the sign of an abscess beginning to develop. Promptly use a fire needle to puncture the white grain.<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If accidentally touched or immersed in hot water, one may feel slight redness, swelling, and pain. After three to four days, if it does not dissipate, a red halo begins to spread. Careful observation is needed to notice whether the halo is wide or narrow, approximately four to five inches in diameter. The whole body feels feverish and slightly thirsty, and the sore also feels hot; this is known as a boil. Use a fire needle to pierce about an inch deep into the initial white granule, spacing the punctures around one inch apart, making four punctures in total. Then wash with a decoction of four herbs, five to six times over one day and night. After washing, gently dry with soft cloth, and check for any new white granules forming on the sore, resembling millet; whether few or many, they can be removed with a silver spatula, avoiding any blood. If a little blood does emerge, it’s still acceptable, but avoiding blood is preferable. Then apply an old skin powder. Mix a cooling water solution with a large iron ring powder to surround the area, leaving the sore&#39;s opening untouched. At the sore opening, apply a mix of regular iron ring powder.

<p>For cases of swelling with heat and pain, where the pulse is floating, the pathogen is on the surface, and one should release it. If there is internal retention, one may use decoctions. </p>
<p>For swelling that is hard and painful with a deep pulse, the pathogen is internal and should be purged, for instance with Huang Lian Nei Shu Decoction, Xian Fang Huo Ming Drink, or Ku Shen Wan. </p>
<p>If there is no exterior heat or swelling, yet internal conditions are favorable for adjustments, the pathogen is in the meridians and one should harmonize the Ying and Wei (nutritive and defensive Qi) with prescriptions like Tuo Li Rong Wei Decoction, Bai Zhi, and Sheng Ma. </p>

<p>The &quot;Jiyan&quot; states: When the carbuncle has ruptured and pus has come out with the flesh decaying, one should apply a poison-extracting ointment. As the pathogenic qi gradually retreats, both qi and blood will also be deficient; thus, the pulse, which is full and rapid, should gradually be reduced. Internally, one must nourish the spleen to ensure that qi and blood are abundant, and the righteous qi is strong, leading to pus that is bright and thick, with redness and swelling gradually subsiding. The medicine should nourish qi and generate blood, with slight additions of remedies to resist wind and cold in the autumn and winter, such as cassia in the &quot;Shixuan San&quot; and &quot;Shiquan Dabu Tang.&quot; If there is stagnation of qi, add Xiangfu. If the toxicity has greatly receded but qi and blood have not yet recovered, one should frequently use ginseng, angelica, astragalus, and similar remedies like &quot;Sìwùtāng.&quot; Although the carbuncle has already produced pus, if the root area appears red and expands widely, whether painful or very painful, it indicates that the toxic qi has not retreated. Use &quot;Jinyin Baizhi San&quot; and &quot;Shixuan San,&quot; increasing the dosage of houpu, ginseng, chuanqiong, and astragalus, while also adding honeysuckle vine, forsythia, rhinoceros horn, and detoxifying drugs such as luogen.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a></p></div>

If tonifying herbs are not suitable, one should consider using Yin Dong Wan. For swollen and inflamed areas around, use a fine needle to burn and prick them approximately one meter deep; if red and swollen, they will retract. It is best if the pulse becomes harmonious and gentle after taking the medicine. If the sore does not rupture but has hard edges, it is due to wind; apply Scorpion Powder. If the necrotic flesh does not decay, use realgar and light powder for application. It is highly discouraged for the redness and swelling to persist. If food intake is minimal, one should adjust the spleen and stomach accordingly, or if there are additional symptoms, treatment should be discussed separately. Necrotic flesh that does not respond to pain or itching can be removed, but care must be taken not to harm the surrounding healthy flesh or the good flesh inside. When removing black necrosis from the outside, one should also eliminate the yellow and white parts that are cotton-like in appearance. If there are red blood streaks in the pus, do not disturb; this indicates substantial pus that will likely fall off the next day, thus avoiding damage to healthy flesh.

According to the &quot;Ghostly Writings,&quot; whether an abscess or boil is large or small, painful or painless, hot or not hot, cold or not cold, if it swells from small to large and rises over one foot, and is red, swollen, and hot, one should immediately apply urgent medicine to encircle and confine the redness and swelling, preventing it from breaking open. At the center, apply poultices to draw out pus and disperse toxins, urgently expelling the toxins outward and using internal medicines to expel pus and reduce toxins. Once the pus forms, break the abscess in succession, observing the size and depth of the sore to release the pus effectively. If there is a large outpouring of pus, it is crucial to nourish the inside while expelling it. Even if the abscess breaks, if the pus is not abundant, further efforts to expel pus and toxins are still necessary. After dispersing, care must be taken not to allow swelling to return; one must ensure that the pain subsides and the swelling diminishes. If the patient feels lighter, it is a sign of recovery. It is most important to be cautious with diet. If there is a strong heat toxin, it may cause great thirst; excessive drinking of cold water or cool drinks can disturb the heart, leading to dry mouth and thirst. To alleviate this, medications that nourish the heart and support the organs should be utilized.

<p>The &quot;Collection of Evidence&quot; states: A tense and rapid pulse indicates that the pus has not yet formed, while a relaxed pulse with rapid beats suggests that the pus has formed. If pressing the area feels hot, there is pus; if it does not feel hot, there is no pus. If pressing brings a hard sensation, there is no pus; if it feels somewhat soft, pus is present; only when it is very soft is the pus fully formed. If pressing it causes pain, the pus is deep; if it does not cause much pain, it has not yet formed. If pressing it causes a rebound effect, pus is present; if there is no rebound, there is no pus. Light pressing that brings pain and shows a thin skin that is raised indicates shallow pus; if pressing causes pain in four locations but the skin color does not change and is not elevated, it is deep pus. Shallow pus should be treated with medicinal puncturing, elevated pus requires a needle, and deep pus should be cauterized. Further details on the conditions: if the swollen area is soft and painless, it is a blood tumor. If the swelling gradually increases without significant heat and causes pulling pain occasionally, it is a qi tumor. If the swelling is soft and yellow, it indicates fluid. Slight qi stagnation with mild swelling that persists and later turns into pus is caused by cold and heat.<a id="trans-276p" href="#orig-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Retention leads to accumulation over time, with yin accumulating and giving rise to yang. Cold transforms into heat, and this will inevitably cause rupture and create sores, so it is advisable to take internal medications early to expel it. Various tumors, warts, and growths will tend to rupture internally as one ages, and blindly using tonics without caution will surely lead to danger. As for scrofula and tuberculosis, persistent symptoms of cold and heat, along with thirst, will result in a pale and yellowish complexion, with heat rising and forming pus. The treatment can be found in the previous section. When abscesses on the hands, feet, fingers, or breast are involved, they should be allowed to mature sufficiently to a large extent before being opened. If there are abscesses in the joints, once pus is felt, it must be released promptly, or it may lead to contractures. </p>
<p>For extracting pus: When dealing with any boil or swollen abscess, apply pressure with the fingers around the edges. If the surrounding skin is red-black and does not change color upon pressure, the pus is already formed. If the area turns red with slight pressure, there is also pus. If it is initially white but eventually turns red, then the toxins have subsided. One can use moxibustion at the red and white areas until the flesh is flat and firm, and only then will it heal completely. </p>

Even if needles are used to puncture and release the pus, it might not be effective; urgent use of a medicine to draw out the pus and support the body&#39;s strength is necessary. </p>
<p>Moreover, if an abscess forms in a solid area, regardless of its depth, any presence of pus should warrant the safe use of needles to burn, as slight cooling might risk injuring the muscles or bones internally.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Evil Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>All painful and itchy sores belong to the heart. All damp and swollen fullness belongs to the spleen. The heart governs the blood, while the spleen governs the flesh. When blood is hot and the flesh is damp, the combination of dampness and heat breaks down the skin and persists endlessly. It cannot be definitively named, hence it is called the evil ulcer. However, there is a distinction: conditions like scabies, boils, and rashes, where stagnated qi and blood are located between the skin&#39;s pores, can be treated by dispersing them. The Inner Canon states that if there is sweating, the sore has already healed. If the stagnated qi and blood lie within the muscles but connect to the skin, causing alternating chills and fever, and producing pus, it may be due to emotional disturbances or the effects of rich foods. In such cases, it is advisable to resolve the internal heat, and sweating is not suitable. Zhang Zhongjing mentioned that for sores, one must not induce sweating; if one sweats, it will lead to spasms. </p>
<p>There is a distinction in whether to induce sweating based on the state of the sore, which may be shallow or deep, superficial or internal. Therefore, for sores on the skin, one should treat them lightly by inducing sweating, bathing them, and applying external remedies that kill insects, moisten dryness, and resolve stagnation. For sores in the muscles, one should reduce heat in the meridians, cool the qi and blood, and use poultices that promote pus formation and muscle regeneration. For sores on the head, one should expel them by drawing them out with cooling agents prepared with alcohol, additionally using wind-dispersing herbs to raise and elevate, while applying external medicines that kill insects and relieve heat. Understanding these three aspects accounts for more than half of the treatment for sores.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a></p></div>

<p>Boils and abscesses are named for their shape resembling a cap. They typically appear on the head, face, and limbs, often forming yellow blisters, and sometimes purple-black. They usually begin with itching, followed by pain, and initially cause chills before leading to fever. Within one or two days, a person may experience chills, fever, heavy limbs, palpitations, dizziness, headaches, and body aches, along with anomalous symptoms. One should carefully inspect the body; if there are small sores that differ slightly from usual sores, they are likely boils. Generally, purple blisters are common, while clustered lumps are rare. They frequently occur on the hands and less often in other areas. When they occur on the legs, red lines often extend to the navel; when on the arms, they may extend to the armpits; when on the lips or inside the mouth, red lines may reach the throat. If a needle is inserted into a sore, and there is no pain or blood, this is indicative. The classics state that indulgence in rich food causes large boils. Essentially, they arise from excessive consumption of rich delicacies, sudden intake of toxic foods, exposure to inappropriate seasonal influences, contact with snake and insect venoms, or the consumption of meat from animals that died of epidemics. When people sweat and mix it with food, it can also lead to boils. Each case should be carefully diagnosed and treated.<a id="trans-282p" href="#orig-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a></p></div>

Generally, for a boil, one should puncture the center until it is painful, then prick around to let out bad blood, applying medicine afterward; the medicinal properties should enter through the needle holes. If the needle does not penetrate the wound, it will not be effective.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Causes of Boils and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Why do boils and abscesses appear on the back? A healthy body manifests such forms. Those without illness in the world have a balance of water and fire, and their essence and blood are abundant. The &quot;Nourishing Life&quot; chapter states: Do not shake your essence, do not wear out your body; by returning to a tranquil mind and silence, one can achieve longevity. All this leads one away from worldly matters, forgetting fame and profit, and relinquishing greed and anger, thus avoiding illness. This is something only those who cultivate themselves to preserve life can achieve; how can modern people compare? It is said that tranquility generates water, while activity generates fire. Water nurtures all things, while fire can overcome all things; therefore, all diseases arise from fire. Once fire arises, the seven emotions and six desires are similarly affected. After they enter, various diseases manifest. Internally, they cause issues like wind disturbance, phlegm, and internal injuries; externally, they result in boils and abscesses on the back or sores on the mouth. This summarizes the main ideas.<a id="trans-298p" href="#orig-298p" class="marker">[298p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, the formation of carbuncles is due to obstruction; the poison from the six bowels surges outward, appearing suddenly with superficial ailments, because the cause of illness is derived from the yang aspect. Yang energy is light and clear, rising high and floating, which makes it easy to swell, form pus, decay, and heal, indeed leading to conditions that do not harm the tendons and bones, and are easy to treat. In contrast, abscesses are about stagnation, relating to the yin and affecting the five organs, with poison attacking from within, resulting in gradual onset and deep-seated ailments, because the yin blood is heavy and turbid, tending to sink, thus leading to conditions that harm tendons and bones, making them hard to treat. Generally, in the young, strong qi and blood can conquer poison, while in the elderly, poison can overpower qi and blood, making conditions perilous. The treatment methods are detailed in the second discussion, which should be looked at carefully.</p>
<p>Internally, the seven emotions can affect the organs; worry and overthinking are closely related to the heart. </p>

These six harmful influences all enter from the outside. For those with a strong constitution, there may be instances where they are unaffected by these influences; however, for those with weak constitutions, they are often susceptible. There are also cases where one may experience these influences without immediate effect, with pathogenic energies lodged in the organs, channels, and joints for a long time, either resulting in internal damage or triggered by external pathogenic factors.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In those times, many people would use charcoal to smoke food, or cook it in oil and fat, resulting in flavors that are fragrant, dry, sweet, salty, sour, and sometimes spicy. They also resorted to heavy ingredients for pickling and cooking rich broths to achieve a refreshing taste, without caring about the negative effects on their bodies. Furthermore, they indulged in the company of favored concubines, feeling spiritually uplifted, surrounded by warm beds and the heat of the stove. Often, they would eat before feeling hungry and indulge in food before it cooled, seeking immediate pleasure without regard for moderation; if something was slightly insufficient in flavor, they would seek stimulation, focusing solely on fleeting enjoyment without realizing the depletion of their vitality over time. With those who suffer from ailments, these issues do not stem from simple foods, but rather from rich and fatty diets. Who understands that the taste of rich foods is fleeting, inferior to that of simple grains and vegetables? Thus, those who know their limits should avoid such indulgences and choose wisely when they do indulge.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five organs correspond to the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They are typically in a harmonious cycle of generation, as when wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, and water generates wood. When these five organs are in harmony and generating each other, how could illness arise? Thus, when sickness occurs, the five organs must be in conflict and counteracting each other; that is to say, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, and metal overcomes wood. This mutual punishment and conflict among the five organs leads to changes and transformations, resulting in illness. It is said that what generates is prosperous, while what counteracts leads to demise. This indeed reflects the fundamental principle of the generation and overcoming of all things, not limited to the discussion of diseases. Furthermore, if the five organs are not in harmony, the six bowels will not function properly; if the six bowels do not function, the nine orifices will become weak and unwell; and if the nine orifices become weak and unwell, it will result in abscesses.

<p>Conditions below the heart tend to be milder, and those of the six bowels might be lighter as well. (Note: Sores arising from below the heart, except for the kidney shu point, are generally milder. The six bowels refer to the Stomach meridian of the Foot Yangming, the Small Intestine meridian of the Hand Taiyang, the Bladder meridian of the Foot Taiyang, and the Pericardium meridian of the Hand Jueyin: according to the “Xian Shu,” the six bowel meridians include the Large Intestine meridian of the Hand Yangming, but not the Pericardium meridian. The three Jueyin and Gallbladder meridians of the Foot Shaoyang are also involved. Although these meridians are classified as bowels and their energy governs the exterior, their diseases manifest as sores. Therefore, illnesses arising from the five zang organs are considered severe, while those from the six bowels are seen as light. This illustrates the distinction in severity between the internal organs and bowels.) The spleen accumulates toxins that result in shoulder and back issues.<a id="trans-305p" href="#orig-305p" class="marker">[305p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition occurring below the shoulder and above the spine is caused by toxic accumulation from rich foods. If the swelling is distinctly raised and stands no more than the width of the shoulders, it is considered advantageous. First, it is important to detoxify and protect the heart, followed by clearing away the heat from within. One may intermittently use wax alum pills and heart-protecting powders to defend against toxicity affecting the heart. If the swelling is flat and hard, gradually enlarging and opening, attacking both shoulders and the chest, or if the swelling is irregular, this indicates a serious condition.</p>
<p>Regarding the heart&#39;s fire toxicity: when the heart exhibits symptoms, it is due to excessive heat arising from the heart&#39;s fire. Moreover, as the heart governs the body, heat accumulates throughout and converges here, resulting in problems. This condition is colloquially referred to as the toxic disturbance at the sovereign point, which is most harmful, blocking the governing vessels and causing significant harm. As this area of the spine has many indentations, it is difficult to manifest; the ulcers appear depressed, and the swelling is neither high nor pointed. Treatment must focus on significantly reducing heart fire and urgently dispersing the accumulated heat. Acupuncture should be applied to achieve unblocking, and various extraction methods must ensure that toxic gases are expelled from both inside and outside, thus preventing internal attacks, which would be effective. </p>
<p>If, after fifteen days, there are no changes and pus is produced, it indicates resolution. If, however, changes occur with the swelling becoming harder and larger without producing pus, prognosis is poor, with death likely occurring around the twenty-second day. This condition is particularly urgent and values early treatment, with a 30% to 40% chance of recovery if addressed promptly.<a id="trans-306p" href="#orig-306p" class="marker">[306p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The left corresponds to the liver, and the right to the lung. Conditions arising from the movement of the shoulder bones can be treated. Ancient texts say left intertwines with the right, and the right with the left, both difficult to treat, though I disagree. Every physician who sees this intertwining has never observed death, so long as the treatment method is appropriate. Begin treatment with universal pills to induce sweating, smoothing the internal and external pathways; then apply liver-clearing and stagnation-resolving decoctions, using the Four Gentlemen Decoction for Qi and the Four Substance Decoction for blood, and later the Eight Treasures Decoction alongside the Six Stagnation Decoction for proper adjustment. This approach is indeed sound. However, this condition originally arises from phlegm-accumulated Qi-stagnation and liver fire stagnation, causing disharmony in Qi and blood. The principle is to open what is blocked, and to move what is stagnant. If one uses detoxifying and Qi-releasing remedies indiscriminately, or relies solely on tonics, it will lead to numerous dangers.)</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> The area known as &quot;Shen Shu&quot; is located between the two loins, within the flesh surrounding the kidneys, and can also appear at the center. Conditions arising from this area are particularly dire. This is because the inner kidney is the root of life, storing essence, vital energy, and spirit. It is also said to be responsible for the innate fate, nurturing both men and women, and supporting longevity. All these functions originate from the kidney.</p>
<p><strong>Disease Cause:</strong> The illness is often a result of excessive sexual activity, leading to depletion of energy and damage to essence. This results in fiery desires consuming the yin, while external yang influences create disturbances, ultimately depleting the true water and true yin. Once depleted, the organs become deficient, allowing various pathogenic fires and influences to enter. After entering, these can coalesce into sores. If the primary organ has some true yin to restrain the fire, the sores may appear red, active, swollen, and pus-filled. Treatment should involve Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang, along with additions of Shan Yu, Wu Wei Zi, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu, as well as variations of Ba Wei Wan to replenish the source.</p>
<p>If the sores are purple-black, dry, hard, and do not produce pus, this indicates internal failure of true yin, with no hope for recovery, likely leading to death within about fifteen days.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition arising from the “zheng” (正) is attributed to the governor vessel (督脉), while the condition arising from the “pian” (偏) is related to the taiyang bladder (太阳膀胱). Both types stem from the upward attack of damp heat, which cause obstruction and accumulation. The governor vessel can easily treat sores despite being classified as “zheng,” because it originates from below and runs along the spine above, allowing the toxic qi to confront the swelling, preventing malevolent toxins from descending and resulting in external eruptions, making it easier to treat. In contrast, sores related to the bladder are difficult to treat, even though they are categorized as “pian.” This is because the bladder meridian begins at the crown and travels down the sides of the neck, flowing downward and merging with the toxic sores, resulting in many flat and collapsed sores. Moreover, the taiyang bladder governs cold waters, which are characterized by coolness and heaviness; thus, its sores are often difficult to swell, their color difficult to appear red and vibrant, they are rigid and hard to ulcerate, and may easily cause swelling around the shoulders and neck. If there is no pus after fifteen days, it will definitely turn black and enter the realm of yin, leading to a high rate of untreatability. It is a common misconception to consider “zheng” as serious and “pian” as minor, which stems from ignorance. The treatment should focus on Huanglian Xiaodu Decoction, while the rest should aim to clear fire, transform phlegm, detoxify, and calm the heart, with the elimination of obstruction being crucial. </p>

Both arise from excessive thoughts and mental strain, indecisiveness leading to an excess of fire and stagnation, which in turn leads to this sickness. Therefore, the body tends to be hard, the head often concealed, blackened before rupture, rotting before pus forms, foul odors easily arise, vital energy easily declines, and poisonous gas tends to be internalized rather than expressed outwardly, ultimately leading to internal attack and death. However, this condition initially arises subtly, making people largely unaware; when they do become aware, the poison has already entered within.

The medicine acts violently, whether through washing, chewing, holding in the mouth, or hiding below the navel, blocking the pathways of essence. If not weakened over time, this brings momentary pleasure but ultimately leads to harm, accumulating toxins in the organs, drying and burning the true yin, creating calamity in the body, which must eventually manifest.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Treatise on Methods, General Overview, Part Two</p>
<p>How should we treat carbuncles and sores that appear on the back? Regardless of yin or yang, first apply moxibustion. If there is no pain, apply moxibustion until there is pain; if there is tenderness, treat it when it is not tender.</p>
<p>(Note: When examining large sores, one must first calmly establish a firm decision. Start from the visible date of onset and count the days to see if the shape of the sore corresponds with the time. A match indicates a better prognosis, while a mismatch suggests greater danger. Next, investigate the source of the illness: which organ it stems from and what part of the body is affected. Consider the vertical alignment of the body, whether the affected area is safe or hazardous, discern the colors and forms, and analyze the spirit&#39;s presence or absence. Also take into account the age—whether old or young—and the state of qi and blood, whether they are strong or weak, if it involves yang or yin, and the depth of toxicity. Generally, those with yang conditions are easier to treat, while those with yin are more difficult to manage. </p>
<p>Examine the pulse for its fullness or emptiness to ascertain good or bad outcomes, thus deciding on the final approach. Before a sore breaks, the pulse should exceed normal by one or two beats; after it breaks, it should be less by two or three beats. This reflects the disease&#39;s pulse correlation, which remains consistent. If the opposite occurs, be wary of unforeseen complications. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the method depends on the precision of observation and the heart&#39;s correspondence, meticulously considering each detail, ensuring clarity in both internal and external aspects, before determining the treatment. If the sore has not formed within seven days, the vital energy remains strong; regardless of yin or yang, external or internal conditions, cold or heat, emptiness or fullness, moxibustion should be applied first.<a id="trans-312p" href="#orig-312p" class="marker">[312p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The light symptoms allow the poisonous gas to disperse with the fire, while the severe symptoms draw out the accumulated toxins, penetrating internally and externally. When the evil combines with fire and the poisonous gas mixes with the Yang, swelling and pain may then arise, leading to sweating or attacking the illness. Treatment may involve either dissipating or uplifting, seeking to address both the symptoms and the root cause, and must ensure that the pulse aligns with the medicine, and the medicine aligns with the illness. Healing in this manner will naturally be error-free. Therefore, the prescription of medicine is difficult and relies entirely on active methods; generally, both beginning and end must not harm the vital energy, specifically the spleen and stomach! </p>
<p>Internally, take a dose of toad venom pill, and externally use divine fire to illuminate three branches. </p>
<p>Note: For sores that have just begun, within seven days, or after cauterization without other medications, it is advisable to take one dose of toad venom pill to induce sweating, or the Universal Elixir may also induce sweating. The so-called poisonous gas disperses with sweat, which is the most effective method. If, after taking the two medicines, sweating does not occur, it is due to the closure of both surface and interior; the poison is not light, and careful extraction must be applied. The method of illuminating with divine light is indeed marvelous, but it should not be used too early. If the sore is between four to five days and the shape has not yet formed, and the poison has not yet emerged, applying it too early may leave the accumulation and the internal poison may difficultly emerge. It must be used after eight or nine days, when the sore situation is established, and the poisonous gas has gathered, but has not yet turned to pus or rot. Illuminating at this stage can lead to self-healing of the matured parts, self-dissolution of the unformed, self-suppuration of the intact, and self-dislodgement of the adhered parts, while also able to detoxify, activate blood circulation, reduce swelling, and disperse clots, which is indeed an excellent method. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> For sores, the greatest concern is the invasion of wind and cold. When they first appear, or after cauterization, one should apply Taiyi Ointment on the top. Its effectiveness lies in drawing out toxins, raising the pus, and preventing wind and cold from entering. If there is pain and swelling in a yang sore, after seven days the sore will naturally have yellow, thick pus adhering to the ointment, with surrounding swelling that is red, bright, and vivid. Each day, one should wash it clean with scallion soup and replace the ointment. The proper pus will generally emerge around the eleventh day, which is a sign of easy treatment and tranquility. If after seven days the sore does not swell high and large, the edges are not painful, and there is no sign of pus adhering to the sore, this indicates balance between yin and yang. In such cases, one should use Huafu Zihua Ointment to apply on the sore and cover it with a plaster. Once past the tenth day, if the sore top begins to decay and the surrounding swelling increases, resembling the appearance of pus, the proper pus will only emerge after the fifteenth day, which is a sign that danger is likely to turn into stability.<a id="trans-314p" href="#orig-314p" class="marker">[314p]</a></p></div>

Furthermore, if the edges of the wound show lingering swelling, the key is to apply medicine to bind the base, so as to prevent it from expanding. Initially, it is advisable to use Jinhuang San to apply around the edges, as it helps to draw out toxins, reduce swelling, and alleviate pain. Once the wound has ruptured, one should use iron barrel ointment to bind it, so that the root of the wound gradually tightens. However, various wounds arise from stagnation of qi and blood, and one must not solely use cooling medicines, as they can cause the tissues to harden and complicate healing. It is essential to use medications that disperse stagnation, promote blood flow, and eliminate toxins, as this is the proper approach. </p>
<p>When qi is abundant, the top naturally rises and protrudes; when blood is abundant, the foundation is tight and firm without doubt. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a swelling sore arises, if there is no vital energy to push through, the sore will not be able to form a high bulge, nor will it become painfully inflamed or rupture to release pus. If there is no true yin to provide nourishment, the root of the sore cannot be restrained, and its color will not be able to live and gather. In observing whether the top of the sore is high and the root alive, regardless of age, it is clear that there is an abundance of vital energy and blood; thus, both the young and the old may be untroubled. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Avoid using internal消 (dissolving) and攻伐 (attacking) medicines as they can harm the spleen energy; doing so makes it difficult for pus to form and often prevents proper resolution. If a sore initially appears low and flat, without redness, this indicates that the original energy is weak. It is urgent to use warming and spleen-strengthening herbs to help expel the toxic energy outward, so as to avoid any complications.</p>
<p>For those with severe internal heat, increase the dosage of detoxifying and clearing agents; for those with constipation and dryness, it is essential to ensure that treatment is appropriate to promote bowel movements.

<p>Note: In cases of swollen sores accompanied by internal heat, dry mouth, a firm pulse, and constipation with a preference for cold, this indicates the presence of pathogenic toxins internally. It is crucial to use cold and cooling agents for relief, such as Huanglian Decoction, Sishun Cool Drink, or Woxue Decoction, which can all be chosen for use. If there are also symptoms on the exterior, use Fang Feng Tong Sheng Powder minus Ma Huang, or Shuang Jie Powder with added Jie Geng and Tian Hua Fen.

It is crucial that the treatment promotes movement without leading to leakage, achieving a balance within the organs, ensuring clarity both internally and externally, before using medicines that aid in expelling pus and supplementing internally. </p>
<p>In cases of ulcers, even if one experiences dry mouth and constipation, with signs of disharmony in the organs like difficulty in urination, this is due to excessive pus and fluid loss after a rupture, leading to depletion of fluids and exhaustion of qi and blood, which fails to nourish the organs. Such patients will typically have a subtle and rapid pulse, a dry mouth, and reduced appetite, preferring hot soups. This indicates a disease caused by the fire of deficient yang, which is different from the previously discussed excess; thus, one should focus on nourishing qi and blood, replenishing fluids, harmonizing the organs, and regulating the spleen and stomach. </p>

<p>Note: Any wound after ten days should naturally rot and purulent; if after this period it remains hard, it indicates a balance of yin and yang. This suggests that the root of the wound is deeply embedded. If the needle is not inserted a short distance to open a vent and release the toxic gas, it will inevitably lead to internal damage. If there is pus inside, it should be made easy to discharge; this is akin to opening a door to chase away thieves. </p>
<p>Moreover, if after ten days the wound does not rot but remains red, hot, swollen, and painful, although the pus is delayed, it will eventually emerge without needing to be pricked. This is because the vital energy cannot be sufficient or there is a lack of nutrient medicine, possibly aggravated by the use of cold treatments, or if it has been covered without warming, all of which contribute to delayed pus formation. Those with this condition should use tonifying, spleen-strengthening medicine to nurture and promote the pus. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before a sore has burst, or after medicinal treatment has begun, one must prepare a decoction of scallions and mugwort. This should be used to wash the sore once a day, or even twice if the situation is severe, in order to promote the circulation of blood and qi, facilitating the process of bursting. When the sore has burst or after the use of a medicinal tube, it is especially important to avoid the wind. Remove any old medicine, and place a round plate under the sore for support. Use pig trotter broth to soak a soft cloth, then apply it to the sore, letting it enter the opening. Gently press out the internal pus, so that the necrotic matter and stagnant pus can exit along with the broth for cleanliness.</p>
<p>Next, take a soft cloth folded into seven or eight layers, ensuring it does not dry out, and cover the sore with it. Gently press with both hands in a circular motion for a while. Once the cloth warms up, change it. Repeat this washing and pressing four to five times to ensure the circulation of blood and qi, allowing the patient to naturally feel at ease. This will resolve any congestion, release toxins, detach rotten flesh, and alleviate pain. This method is essential for treating large sores and cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Once the necrotic tissue has detached and fresh red flesh is visible, wash and then apply jade red ointment. Use a spatula to scoop the ointment into your palm and gently dab it onto the new and old flesh. Then, cover it with Taiyi ointment.

Continue this process daily, and within a few days, the pus and necrotic tissue will be completely eliminated, and new flesh will rapidly grow.

The stomach is responsible for intake, and the spleen is responsible for digestion. One represents the external, the other the internal; one takes in, the other processes. Their functions operate continuously, giving rise to endless transformations of life. The qi and blood throughout the body, spreading through all meridians, limbs, and bones, as well as the five organs and six bowels, all depend on this for nourishment. When the spleen and stomach are strong, food can be consumed abundantly, leading to easy satiety, increased weight, and robust qi and blood.

Thus, life depends on this for sustenance, and health relies on it for stability, especially regarding surgery, which is particularly crucial. Those skilled in health preservation moderate their diet, adjust to the seasons, control joy and anger, and minimize labor; this preserves their spleen and stomach.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>People&#39;s vital energy tends to enjoy warmth and dislike cold; in the face of cold, it contracts, and with heat, it disperses. When it comes to sores, which are illnesses of broken flesh, if not properly defended against, wind and cold can easily invade. Therefore, when treating sores in winter, one should use firewood or charcoal to generate warmth and expel any lingering cold. In summer, it&#39;s important to keep the room ventilated and free from drafts before removing dressings and washing the sores. It is commonly observed that patients, in summer, may expose themselves to the wind for relief, or sleep in damp places, and in winter, they neglect warm beds and heated rooms. This leads to cold intrusion, which may mildly hinder flesh regeneration, or severely cause a collapse that does not produce pus or heal properly.</p>
<p>As for diet, there is no need for excessive restrictions; avoid cold, hard, and greasy foods! People rely on food for nourishment and should adjust their diets according to the season. If there is swelling and pain, it naturally harms the stomach&#39;s energy, leading to a dislike for various flavors. Only after the sore is drained and the toxins are discharged does the stomach&#39;s energy return, allowing one to desire food again. Foods that are liked can be provided to replenish the spleen and stomach. However, if desired foods are not provided, it goes against the stomach&#39;s energy and can result in an inability to eat. But moderation is key; excessive cold damages the spleen, hard foods are difficult to digest, and fatty, slippery foods upset the intestines, so they should be avoided.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> For conditions like carbuncles which appear as large sores on the skin, though they manifest externally, the origin of the illness actually lies within. Can treatment focus solely on the external without addressing the internal? Therefore, if external symptoms do not present, internal remedies should be administered; if there is significant exterior heat, internal cooling and detoxifying must be done. For blood deficiency, one should use Siwu Decoction; for qi deficiency, Si Junzi Decoction; if the pulse is weak and the extremities cold, warming treatment is needed; if the pulse is strong and the body is hot, cooling is required. Thus, there is no distinction between internal and external treatment.</p>
<p>When the pulse is weak and the disease is deficient, one must first apply supplementation; when both external and internal conditions are strong, temporary purging should be employed. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Danxi states: In cases where the sore has not yet ruptured and poison is affecting the viscera, not a trace of heating medicine should be used. Once the sore has broken and the viscera are already damaged, not a trace of cooling medicine should be used. This is indeed a true statement! However, there is another aspect to consider. For example, when the initial disease has not yet ruptured, if the pulse is slightly submerged, slow, weak, fine, rapid, or superficially floating, and the exterior shows coolness with spontaneous sweating, along with ease of vomiting and poor appetite, and the sore does not show signs of eruption, heat, pain, suppuration, or pus, these signs are all due to deficiency in qi and blood.<a id="trans-327p" href="#orig-327p" class="marker">[327p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one insists that the previous discussion has not been resolved, and believes in the theory that toxins attack the organs, one will inevitably resort to cold remedies to counteract this, which will further deplete the vital energy. How can one expect recovery from this? I assert that in treating illness, it is irrelevant whether it is at the beginning or the end; it is difficult to be constrained by a number of days. As long as the pulse and symptoms indicate weakness, one should provide nourishment; only then can one achieve complete recovery. If the nourishing remedy is ineffective and weakness is severe, one must use ginseng and astragalus paste or Eight Immortals cake; for those with yang deficiency, spontaneous sweating, and poor appetite, single ginseng paste or Six Gentlemen Decoction with cardamom and wood aromatic, and if severe, add aconite. For diarrhea with intestinal rumbling and gastric weakness causing nausea and vomiting, ginseng and poria decoction with cardamom, yam, wood aromatic, and persimmon calyx. For spleen deficiency causing sagging, loose stools, and a feeling of heaviness at the anus, Zhongyi Qigong Decoction with yam, shan zha, and five-flavor berry selected as needed. </p>
<p>There are those with exterior excess, having fever without sweating and aversion to cold; interior excess presents as strong pulse with body heat and dry stools, and dry mouth. If exterior symptoms are urgent, initially use Jingfang Baidu Decoction to resolve the exterior; if interior symptoms are urgent, first employ Si Shun Qingliang Yin to assault the interior; if both exterior and interior are involved, it is advisable to use Fang Feng Tong Sheng San to address both aspects. This approach varies according to the order of exterior and interior conditions, treating with active methods. The ancients said that those who receive nourishment do not have mixed phlegm-fire or internal toxins; those who cannot receive nourishment are afflicted by simultaneous attacks of yin fire and damp-heat. They also said that those who respond well to nourishing medicines tend to thrive; whereas those who are weak but do not respond to nourishment cannot be healed. </p>
<p>The key to diagnosing illness is in considering both long-standing and new conditions; the method lies in treating with leniency as well as rigor.<a id="trans-328p" href="#orig-328p" class="marker">[328p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating illness, there are both new and longstanding conditions, and the severity can vary between urgent and slow. At the onset of illness, when the vital energy is still strong, treatment should directly address the symptoms; if one uses harsh and overpowering remedies, they will not achieve the desired effect in critical moments. However, once the disease has taken hold, if the exterior symptoms are pronounced, one should use a powerful dispersing remedy like the Wanling Pill. For urgent interior conditions, employ a detoxifying mixture like the Huanglian Decoction to quickly restore balance. </p>
<p>In cases of chronic illness, where the excess and deficiency are in conflict, the vital energy is likely weakened. Even if there are residual, mixed, or complex symptoms, one must first stabilize the foundation before making adjustments, harmonizing, or dispersing the illness. This way, the pathogenic energy gradually recedes, the vital energy gradually revives, dietary intake can be gradually increased, and the foundation becomes solid. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that residual issues will no longer pose a problem.<a id="trans-329p" href="#orig-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The common practitioners do not differentiate between new and chronic illnesses, nor do they understand the connection between deficiency and disease, and how disease leads to deficiency. Furthermore, there are distinctions between deficiency-heat and deficiency-cold. If they recklessly attack or treat conditions, it is akin to a blind person riding a blind horse near a deep pool at midnight—how dangerous this is! </p>
<p>Medications must seek the root and symptoms; the effectiveness is no different than treating the condition first or second. If everything is treated as either an attack or a supplement, the two approaches may lead to errors. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In terms of the operation of heaven and earth, the five movements are the root, and the six qi are the symptoms. In relation to the body, the five organs are the root, and the six bowels are the symptoms. Concerning diseases, the initial illness is the root, and the transmitted illness is the symptom; the vital energy is the root, and the pathogenic energy is the symptom. For any practitioner, it is essential to first treat the root and then address the symptoms, which is indeed the proper method. If one treats the symptoms first and then the root, allowing the pathogenic energy to worsen, the illness will increase. It is also said that in cases of urgency, one treats the symptoms, while in cases of gentleness, one treats the root. For instance, if one first develops a sore and then experiences diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite, it is advisable to focus on the symptoms until the diarrhea stops, the vomiting settles, and eating resumes, before returning to treat the sore. The same principle applies in other cases. If everything is treated uniformly as either an attack or a supplement, it will surely lead to errors, as this pertains to the essence and symptoms of disease. </p>

However, patients often fail to recognize them, thinking they are minor ailments, and do not seek treatment early. Additionally, if they are exposed to wind and cold externally, or suffer internal damage from excessive cold; or if they are improperly treated by a physician with strengthening methods, or if cooling medicines are applied externally to reduce the illness as per the patient&#39;s intent, it frequently leads to the stagnation of qi and blood, damaging the spleen and stomach. Consequently, the toxic pus is unable to surface, resulting in internal attack and potentially fatal outcomes. If changes occur before the eleventh day without the pus having emerged, the condition resembles healthy flesh, is neither painful nor hot, and presents with soft and slow characteristics. The wound only discharges thin, clear fluid, and the body does not feel hot; the pulse is weak and thin, and the appetite is poor, with mental clarity diminished.

For lighter cases, the Ten Complete Great Supplement decoction can be used, both with increased amounts of ginseng, astragalus, cinnamon, and aconite for rescue. It is fortunate when the wound is hot and painful, pus emerges, and the pulse improves with food intake. If the wound originates from yang, it tends to heal easily.</p>

The patient, desiring recovery, may resort to spicy warming decoctions and strong hot medicines to assist healing, while the physician might aim for localized swelling and heat to produce pus, applying hot medicines to stimulate the eruption. Thus, the wound receives the extreme heat of the medicine and turns from yin to yang. Although there may be slight swelling, mild heat, slight pain, and a little pus, the wound&#39;s presentation does not resemble a true yang state of vivid red vitality and cannot attain genuine thick yellow pus because it originally stems from yin, hence many succumb. If the treatment is appropriate, with internal and external harmony, balanced forces, there may be one or two remarkable recoveries amidst ten cases.

When the swelling subsides and pus drains, one&#39;s spirit feels refreshed, and rotten flesh gives way to new growth, with qi and blood rejuvenated. Five blessings naturally arrive in unison, while seven evils are completely absent. Pain decreases with the reduction of pus, the swelling retreats leaving the skin spacious. Newly grown flesh appears bright red, while decayed skin retracts, showing pale white. The whole body feels quite comfortable, and all five organs are harmonious and joyful.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Fourth Song of Pure Yin Syndrome</h3>
<p>Pure yin initially appears without wounds, resembling a hard lump like millet. Not red, not swollen, without pain, slightly warm, slightly hot, lacking defense. After seven days, the body feels weary, and the roots of the wounds are flat, joyfully drenched in soup. The top is not high, and the root is not alive; the color is not bright, and it&#39;s rotten without substance. Soft and sunken, with no pus, just empty gatherings; the pulse is floating, scattered, with great variations. Eating and drinking causes trembling; tasting soup brings a hasty mind. Wounds grow like a garment after shedding armor, and lumps in the openings resemble fragrant seeds. With much pus and foul odor, the body struggles to relieve itself, movements are sad and don&#39;t last long. Wounds form black and purple, and the complexion turns green and yellow. The spirit is hazy, filled with snoring; speech is absent, spontaneously arising. The mouth is dry with a strong tongue; phlegm and wheezing signal impending death. This belongs to pure yin and cannot be treated; each person may reach the fountain.</p>
<h3>Fifth Song of Half Yin Half Yang Syndrome</h3>
<p>In the interplay of yin and yang, life and death coexist, and issues can arise. Slight warmth, slight cold, slight redness and swelling; half dazed, half refreshed, half elevated. Although the pulse comes often, it lacks strength; though food is eaten, it is hard to digest. Swollen but not ulcerated due to spleen weakness; ulcerated but not healing due to excessive pus. Many loose stools and frequent urination; sweating above and a scorched lower body. Five good elements coexist, but seven evils are not fully escaped. Thirsty for tea with abdominal pain; the face puffy, drunken, feeling elevated. Heart troubled and restless, the mind chaotic in fear and noise. Prescribing according to the condition is the secret, yin transforming to yang can gradually be adjusted. The heart truly creates, your life remains firm. Encounter it and it becomes a god’s hand; half dead but still alive, surely do not escape.<a id="trans-336p" href="#orig-336p" class="marker">[336p]</a></p></div>

<p>A good heart brings a clear spirit; words uttered are pure and smooth. Painful sores do not lead to thirst; waking from sleep brings peace. A good liver makes the body light and untroubled; worries are rendered insignificant. The fingers are red and vibrant; sitting up feels balanced and healthy. A good spleen moistens the lips; the bedding smells of sandalwood and musk. Every meal is flavorful, and the flesh becomes plump and rich. A good lung produces a resonant sound; free of phlegm, the voice lasts longer. The skin feels smooth; bowel movements occur regularly. A good kidney is essential; water rises while fire descends. The mouth is harmonious and not thirsty; urination is abundant and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Song of the Seven Evils, Part Seven</strong></p>
<p>First evil: the spirit is muddled, causing a restless heart and a dry tongue. Sores appear purple and black; speech becomes mumbling. Second evil: the waist is strong; the eyes look askance at others. Sores bleed clear fluid, and anxiety afflicts the liver. Third evil: the body is emaciated; foul-smelling pus arises. Sores are soft and sunken; the spleen fails to feel pain. Fourth evil: the skin is dry; the voice is hoarse and lacks resonance. Phlegm is abundant, causing wheezing; the nose is restless, indicating impending lung failure. Fifth evil: insatiable thirst increases; drinking elicits dryness in the mouth.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Song of Treatment for External Wounds - Part Eight</strong></p>
<p>In treating external wounds, follow these guidelines, and make sure to remember them well! Symptoms arise from various roots, with many methods that are not alike. Consider heat and cold, openness and secrecy; understanding the messages leads to knowledge of the causes. Too much openness is insufficient, while excessive secrecy is damaging. Differentiate between true heat and false cold in diagnosis and treatment. Yang can resemble Yin, and Yin can appear like Yang; delve into the subtle principles thoroughly.</p>
<p>Do not treat superficially and internally the same; light conditions may worsen into severe cases and lead to worse outcomes. A physician must be adaptable and cannot rigidly adhere to a single approach. For superficial conditions with severe cold, use Jingfang Baidu San; for internal heat, the internal formula Huanglian Tang is appropriate.</p>
<p>When the wound is established, detoxifying formulas like Tuo Li Xiaoduo San are truly effective; if there’s pus about to burst, the Ten Full Great Supplement Decoction is most suitable. Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang is for post-suppuration nourishing heat; Mu Xiang Liu Qi Yin disperses cold damp causing swelling. If food does not appeal, using Xiang Sha to stimulate appetite is essential; if the spirit is weak, ginseng and atractylodes are needed to revive Yang.</p>
<p>For Yin deficiency and Yang deficiency, Ba Zhen Tang is critical; for night sweats and spontaneous sweating, a single herb of ginseng can strengthen. If pain is prominent after suppuration, the power of Ru Xiang Ding Tong San is remarkable; for a sinking spleen, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang is particularly effective.<a id="trans-338p" href="#orig-338p" class="marker">[338p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Moxibustion Method and Prohibition of Moxibusting Wounds - Chapter Nine</strong></p>
<p>When a wound first appears, moxibustion should be performed only above the neck, using mugwort fire on all other parts. The amount of moxa used should correspond to the size of the wound. Garlic should be sliced thin and placed on top of the wound, then moxa cones are placed on top, and the garlic is ignited, replacing the garlic slices after three burns. If the initial moxibustion causes pain, stop when it turns from pain to itching; if there is no pain at first, you should stop when you feel a slight discomfort. If there is no sensation of pain or itching at all during the initial moxibustion, the garlic should be removed, and stronger moxibustion should be applied. In cases where the wound has been present for several days, if the moxa cones do not sufficiently address the issue, garlic should be crushed and spread on the wound, with moxa also layered on top of the garlic, then ignited for moxibustion, ensuring that the pain is felt significantly for effectiveness. This allows the fire energy to penetrate deeper, indicating that the pain is in a good flesh layer. Essentially, moxa fire draws out hidden toxins, facilitates the opening of the wound, and enables internal toxins to be expelled externally, making this a fundamental first method in wound treatment. Early moxibustion is particularly important for best results.<a id="trans-342p" href="#orig-342p" class="marker">[342p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are also several prohibitions on moxibustion, which should be carefully considered. The head is the summit of all yang, a place of pure yang without yin. Any sores or swellings are caused by excessive yang heat. If moxibustion is applied, it will further intensify the toxic heat, leading to even greater swelling, which is most capable of provoking internal phlegm, resulting in certain death. The same applies to sores on the face.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a point called &quot;Shen Yu,&quot; located beside the spine at the lower back, where the essence of the kidneys is connected. Sores from this point often arise due to sexual exertion causing depletion and depletion of kidney water. If moxibustion is again applied, it will scorch the source, leading to internal and external dryness, often resulting in blackened, sunken depression and death.</p>
<p>Moreover, in patients with intrinsically weak vital energy, sores may not be inflamed or raised. Such individuals will feel lethargic, their spirits will be short and dim, the pulse will be floating, scattered, and empty, quick but without strength. The internal true qi cannot counteract the fiery qi. If moxibustion is applied to such a person, they will likely fall into delirium and die. It is often said that moxibustion does not harm people; this statement is misguided!<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a></p></div>

<p>Upon birth, one is like a grain of millet, able to contain grains within; outwardly, one resembles hemp, while inwardly, one is like a melon; externally, one appears like currency, yet can contain a fist internally. Though the start may be vigorous, it ultimately bears no harm. One may grow gray prematurely, but without pus, one can rest assured. Ulcers arise from bumps, and only upon the emergence of pus may allowance be made. Swelling that bursts with vigor will restore health without treatment. The root is high and the apex even higher; longevity until eighty may still be achievable. Swelling that overheats can easily rot, yet in the end, remains unharmed. Ulcers that are high in heat and pain, although distressing, are destined to heal. When ulcers feel soft and lack vitality, supplementation is beneficial. Flesh that swells without ulceration will undoubtedly raise suspicions. If pus-ridden, one cannot retain their appetite, leading to the calamity of yellow diarrhea. Ulcers appearing purple like pig liver will assuredly lead to death if no pus is present. Soft rotting lacks decay, yet there is fear of grapes being embedded within. Lying on one’s back and feeling no pain indicates a dire condition for survival. When corruption is complete, foul energy arises; smiling while shedding tears is one’s fate. With roots dispersed and ulcers flattened, even deities have no method of treatment. After prolonged illness, if the eyes reveal signs of spirit, one’s life is in peril. The face suddenly appears painted with oil; after ten days, separation is inevitable. Among decay, if there is fresh flesh, even a heavy burden may allow for recovery. New flesh like a board will surely deteriorate without nourishment. Hands and feet that are dry and withered, with blood having failed, bring forth difficulty in preservation. Pale lips and lifeless eyes, with abdominal swelling set to collapse. Stale energy fails to revive, no matter how grave the condition may seem. Darkened eye sockets indicate that abscesses fear this encounter. Aromatic fragrances in the room signify that illness may end in blessing. When ulcers are hot and the body slightly warm, what need is there for concern over a mild illness? Life and death are sought within this; a single word may determine fate.<a id="trans-344p" href="#orig-344p" class="marker">[344p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Causes of Disease and Their Treatment</strong></p>
<p>There are three causes of disease: internal, external, and neither internal nor external. This classification originates from ancient times, and its meaning remains somewhat incomplete. The internal cause arises from the accumulation of the seven emotions within, exacerbated by rich foods and fatty substances that damage the organs. Sexual activity may also fatigue the body, depleting vitality, leading to illness in the five organs. Typically, this manifests more in the wealthy and the obese, with symptoms including numerous hard sores that are deeply rooted. There are irregularities in urination and defecation, reduced appetite, and a soft exterior with a hard interior; the abscesses do not produce pus, indicating a solid exterior but a deficient interior, making it difficult for toxins to discharge. Those who suffer from this represent internal injuries, hence the term internal cause.</p>
<p>The external cause arises from the six excessive influences. Individuals with weak constitutions can be affected by summer and autumn dew when they lie exposed, or by sitting or sleeping in damp areas, leading to the invasion of wind, cold, and dampness into the meridians. Additionally, engaging in sexual activities may lead to the infiltration of cold and toxins into the bones and marrow, further complicating their condition; this might be compounded by external wind pathogens that have not completely dissipated, resulting in swelling and pain. This affects the muscles, blood vessels, tendons, and bones.<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The illness arises from external factors, primarily resulting from poor regulation and care, affecting the laboring class in about 80-90% of the cases. Common symptoms include the alternation of cold and heat, pain in the muscles and bones, difficulty in walking, accumulation of damp phlegm, and various forms of paralysis such as crooked mouth and eyes, hemiplegia, as well as rheumatism and seasonal toxins. Those who suffer from these symptoms are said to be affected by external causes, hence the term “external cause.” </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are cases without both internal and external causes, where there are no emotional disturbances internally or external injuries from the six excesses. How then can such illnesses arise? They often stem from imbalance in eating and labor, irregular emotions, improperly tempered food and drink, and excessive labor resulting in disharmony among the organs, disarray of the protective and nourishing systems, damage to the spleen and stomach, and stagnation in the meridians. Therefore, these illnesses do not present with the six meridian patterns externally, nor with obstruction in urination or defecation internally, and they often manifest in the outer membranes or between the flesh and skin, resembling conditions like scrofula, phlegm accumulation, qi obstruction, or tumors.</p>
<p>In treating these conditions, it is unnecessary to resort to invasive treatments; rather, one should focus on nourishing qi and blood, regulating the meridians, strengthening the spleen and harmonizing the middle, as well as resolving phlegm and alleviating stagnation. This approach is deemed the most effective. Thus ends the discussion of these three causes.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　凡人无病时不善调理，而致生百病，况既病之后，若不加调摄而病岂能得愈乎？其调治有法：初起病时先看病者元气虚实，次看疮之阴阳险否，然后用药调治，当攻即攻，可补便补，不可因循耽悞，以致变态不虞也。且患者又当安定心神，相忘诸念，毋使仓皇，乃保神气不得变乱也。再顺天时，假如夏热，坐卧不可当岚，忌置水于榻前床下；冬寒须避，起居常要温和，非燃火不可开疮看视，恐有寒侵，致生多变。又未溃之先，毒气内作，倘有口干渴证者，凉物须当少少与之，以滋蕴热。至脓溃之后，生冷硬物一概禁之，不然伤脾损胃，脓必难成，致疮软陷，又难收敛。<a id="orig-348p" href="#trans-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidelines for Regulation - Chapter Thirteen</strong></p>
<p>When a person is without illness, they do not know how to manage their health, leading to the emergence of countless diseases. How could one expect to recover from illness if they do not regulate themselves after falling ill? There are principles for treatment: First, examine the patient&#39;s vitality to determine whether it is deficient or sufficient. Next, assess the nature of the sores, considering their yin and yang aspects and any dangers they might present. Then apply treatments accordingly; attack when necessary, supplement when needed. One must not procrastinate or delay, as this can lead to unforeseen complications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the patient must stabilize their mind and let go of distractions, ensuring they do not act hastily, which helps protect their spirit and energy from disruption. Furthermore, one should align with the seasons: in the summer heat, avoid exposure to drafts and do not place water in front of the bed; during winter cold, it is essential to keep warm and moderate in daily activities. It is crucial to prevent cold from entering the body, as it can cause various complications. </p>
<p>Before sores have ruptured, if there are signs of internal toxins, and if the patient experiences dry mouth and thirst, they should be given cool items in small amounts to help nourish and balance the internal heat. Once the pus has erupted, all cold and hard substances should be avoided; otherwise, it will damage the spleen and stomach, complicating the formation of pus, leading to soft, sunken sores that are hard to heal.<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Food and drink must be fragrant, dry, sweet, and pleasant; porridge and rice should align with one’s preferences, and one should not eat to excess. It is better to consume small portions that are warm and rich, to avoid stagnation, and they should also be easy to digest. After a large sore has burst, when both qi and blood are deficient and the spleen and stomach are weak, one must prepare Eight Immortals Cake and eat a few pieces morning and evening to replenish vital essence and support the fundamentals. Furthermore, one should prepare ginseng and atractylodes paste. </p>
<p>If a patient has both a weak spleen and stomach, decreased appetite, tightness in the chest, and finds food tasteless, then take three spoonfuls of atractylodes paste and two spoonfuls of ginseng paste, and consume it with clear rice broth on an empty stomach; if one enjoys drinking, it can also be mixed with wine. If the patient feels lethargic, drowsy, has spontaneous sweating, is fatigued, and is sluggish, then three spoonfuls of ginseng paste and two spoonfuls of atractylodes paste should also be mixed with wine. </p>
<p>For cases with rough skin, a pale complexion, blood in stool, scant and constipated bowel movements, or dry skin and hair, mix two spoonfuls of prepared rehmannia paste and take it, or drink Yangchun wine, which is even better. These remedies strengthen spirits, quickly generate qi and blood, stimulate appetite, support the spleen, and nourish the skin and bones. These two medicines are extraordinarily effective and are essential after a large sore; they are incomparable to herbal remedies. The patient should trust in these treatments to avoid further changes. A cursory glance may suggest many ailments are recurrent and unstable. Thus, there is a distinction between easy and difficult recovery, which truly depends on gaining or losing these remedies.<a id="trans-349p" href="#orig-349p" class="marker">[349p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Miscellaneous Prohibitions to Know, Chapter 14</strong></p>
<p>All illnesses, though they may require medication and regulation, must also adhere to certain prohibitions. First, the sickroom must be kept clean; in winter, it should be warm with proper bedding, and in summer, it should be cool, to prevent the intrusion of flies and centipedes. Monks, nuns, those in mourning, women engaged in religious duties, and distant guests should not see patients with open wounds. Odorous and strong-smelling substances like beef, dog meat, and preserved or cured items can cause thirst and dryness; cold fruits like melons, pears, persimmons, water chestnuts, and dates can harm the stomach and injure the spleen. Meats from chickens, geese, sheep, as well as shellfish, pufferfish, shrimp, and crabs can provoke itching and wind disorders. Greasy, fried, grilled, salty, and sour foods greatly aid the creation of phlegm. Red beans and buckwheat can provoke illnesses due to agitation; anger and anxiety can lead to fullness and obstruction; overeating can surely harm the spleen. After a wound has healed, engaging in labor too soon can lead to weakness, while entering a room prematurely can diminish longevity. Not avoiding wind and cold can cause the resurgence of toxins. Not adjusting one&#39;s diet can lead to excessive itching from wounds. Large wounds should be avoided for six months, while minor wounds should be avoided for a hundred days. This is indeed the wisdom of a knowledgeable gentleman.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Methods for Abscesses</h3>
<p>When an abscess first appears, whether it is painful or not, and regardless of the yin and yang or exterior and interior, if it has not yet produced pus, it is advisable to cauterize it. After cauterization, if there is uncertainty about pain or itching, apply cauterization again. If there is swelling accompanied by heat, occasional pain, and a floating, rapid pulse without constipation, it is suitable to apply medication. If the body feels rigid, the pulse is tense, and there is aversion to cold while preferring warmth, the pathogen is on the exterior, and it is appropriate to induce sweating. If the swelling is hard and pain is deep, with dryness of the mouth and constipation, and the body is hot with a solid pulse, the pathogen is in the interior, and purging is recommended. If the pain intensifies, with restlessness and a desire for cold drinks, alongside a dry tongue and parched mouth, the heat is ascending, and it is advisable to clear it. If the swelling is painful and hard, with a back feeling like it is bearing a stone, accompanied by nausea and dry vomiting, the toxic pathogen is internal; thus, detoxification is necessary, and if the swelling and pain worsen daily without internal pus draining and the wound is filled with stagnant flesh, it is urgent to open and cut it. If the swelling is soft and has not produced pus or does not ulcerate, it indicates a deficiency of yang energy, and strengthening the spleen and stomach to support yang energy is essential. If the body feels cool, there is spontaneous sweating, hands and feet are cold, the six pulses are weak and thin, with diarrhea, it indicates yang collapse, and urgent warming is needed.<a id="trans-352p" href="#orig-352p" class="marker">[352p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ulcer Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>When the pus is matured but not yet ruptured, and the sore is not hot and the appetite is low with loose stools, this indicates spleen deficiency; thus, warm the interior and nourish. If the pus is clear or abundant, and the sore is widely opened without new tissue forming, this suggests internal deficiency and possible transformation of the condition; thus, administer strong tonics. Even if necrotic tissue has sloughed off, if new tissue is slow to grow and appears frost-colored, this indicates cold and weak flesh; therefore, provide strong warming to Qi and blood. After rupture, if there is little appetite, restlessness, insomnia, fever with thirst, this indicates weak spleen and yin deficiency; thus, tonify the middle and benefit Qi. If there is a cool body, weak pulse, lethargy with little speech, and lack of taste in food, this indicates weak spleen; therefore, awaken the spleen and assist the stomach. If wind-cold affects the sore, causing pale skin that does not contract, provide warmth from within and nourishment from without. If after rupture the face is yellow and the body is thin with clear and sparse pus, and the sore appears pale white, this indicates the need for fragrant drying to support the spleen. If the pulse is large and weak, fine, soft, and slightly submerged, along with spontaneous sweating and coolness of the body, this indicates deficiency of both Qi and blood; thus, administer strong tonics. If there is bleeding or copious pus, along with palpitations in the palms and something like fever, with agitation and insomnia, this indicates loss of yang; thus, respond urgently with tonics. If the sore has closed, but there has been sexual activity or strenuous labor, or if there is sudden severe rupture again, supportive tonics for Qi and blood are still necessary.<a id="trans-353p" href="#orig-353p" class="marker">[353p]</a></p></div>

<p>Sores on the back are called &quot;yang&quot; or &quot;yin&quot;, and the same goes for the shoulder and arm. Lung yang is on the right, while yin is on the left; bee sores are found on both sides near the throat. The right ear corresponds to sharp poison, and left ear yang meets at the same point. The two shoulders together are named &quot;tied hands,&quot; with &quot;well sores&quot; originating from the heart. </p>
<p>Flowing channels and tendons connect six or seven constitutions, appearing below the heart, directly at the navel. Rib sores develop below the ribs, and yin sores typically appear near the gate. Ankle sores penetrate beneath the solitary joint, while foot ailments originally arise from the soles. The left corresponds to easy poison and the right to fish mouth, with crane knee wind forming at the knee&#39;s eye. </p>
<p>Below the shoulder, the armpit has yin sores, and the throat&#39;s upper and lower parts require treatment for qi sores. Note the pulse at the &quot;Dui&quot; point, which is three inches apart and penetrates the bone base. Red thread sores arise from the hands, while moth-like throat wind occurs within the mouth. </p>
<p>Kidney sores manifest on the left and right at the kidneys, with the &quot;Sanli&quot; point indicating attached yin sores. Four inches from the navel is the &quot;Xia&quot; sore, three inches higher is the &quot;You&quot; sore. Intestinal sores also emerge from the navel, whereas chest sores are centered in the heart and lungs, just above the breast. </p>
<p>The &quot;Hegu&quot; sore is named &quot;Tiger&#39;s Mouth,&quot; and the &quot;Snake Head&quot; meets the &quot;Fish Belly&quot; on the fingertips. A sore at the back of the head is called &quot;Jade Pillow,&quot; which should not be confused with others. </p>
<p>Shoulder sores and &quot;Le&quot; sores are on the right hand, and the pomegranate is three inches from the elbow. Left kidney yin and right crotch sores appear, while biting bone occurs above the &quot;Yinbao&quot; point. Deep kidney sores are found on the legs, attached to the bones, while &quot;Fo Ding&quot; sores arise from the top of the brain. </p>

<p>Carbuncles are a swift external disease. They can appear in the morning and result in death by evening; some may not die for three to five days, yet eventually succumb after a month or a half-month. This variation depends on the depth of the poison, the imbalance of the organs, and the temperature of the season, as well as sudden changes in the environment. In livestock, when a body decays, their temperament can drastically change, causing a violent reaction that leads to immediate onset. For humans, those with deficient qi and blood can be affected according to their organs. For example, if toxic energy arises from the heart meridian, it manifests as fiery carbuncles. This condition often appears in the lips, mouth, palms, and finger joints, starting as small red-yellow blisters that cause intense itching and pain, along with numbness in the limbs. In severe cases, one may experience alternating chills and fever, dizziness, irritability, mental confusion, and disorientation; these symptoms arise from heart-related afflictions.

In serious cases, the eyes become red and squinting, the nails turn dark blue, the tongue stiffens, and the spirit becomes dull, often accompanied by restless sleep and startling dreams.

The five types of sores correspond to the five visceral organs. </p>
<p>Additionally, the red thread sore appears between the joints of the palm, initially resembling a small wound, then developing red threads that escalate to the knuckles, causing chills and fevers, and in severe cases, nausea and vomiting. If left untreated, the red threads can reach the heart and may lead to serious harm. To treat the red thread sore, one should use a needle at the tip of the red thread to create an incision and let it bleed, then make an incision at the initial wound, inserting toad venom strips and applying medicated plaster, with internal consumption of diaphoretic medicines for self-healing. </p>
<p>In treating this condition, early intervention is crucial. Those treated promptly have a full chance of recovery, while those treated slightly later may have a chance of only fifty to sixty percent. Those who neglect treatment only have a slim one or two in ten chance of recovery.<a id="trans-358p" href="#orig-358p" class="marker">[358p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the condition begins above the neck, if the three yang channels are affected by poison, one must use a beryllium needle to pierce the center of the sore four or five fen deep, severing the root of the carbuncle to allow the bad blood to flow out. Then, one should apply Huai-Deng Dan or toad venom strips into the opening and cover it with an ointment. If the condition is below the neck and the three yin channels are affected, one should resort to moxibustion. If the moxibustion is painless, it is also necessary to use needles to insert medicinal substances for effectiveness. Subsequently, one should use toad venom pills. In winter, with Wanling Dan, inducing a vigorous sweat is necessary to dissipate the poison, lest it linger and cause transformations. Nowadays, people’s treatment methods do not differentiate between yin and yang or the surface and internal; whenever they see a sore, they apply moxibustion indiscriminately. They do not realize that the head is the apex of all yang, and excessive yang heat leads to serious issues. Although small, its harm is significant; further moxibustion only enhances the fire, forcing the poison inward to attack, which may result in severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin. After this occurs, the head, face, ears, and neck can all swell, resembling a bloated corpse, arising with seven evils. Even if there are methods available for treatment, only one or two out of a hundred may be effective. Moreover, there are various types of carbuncles with differing shapes, hence the old sayings about them are not recorded in detail here.<a id="trans-359p" href="#orig-359p" class="marker">[359p]</a></p></div>

Once the condition has formed, if the sore is swollen but the flesh is not, surrounded by white, causing more pain and less itching, and produces pus, it is favorable. If pus has already oozed out but the sore remains high and swollen, with bright flesh and a gradually flattening center that is red and lively, it is favorable.

If before erupting, there are symptoms of cold and heat like malaria, with nausea and loss of appetite, and later, the sore appears like mosquito bites or flea spots, or in bluish-purple and black blisters, soft and depressed with deep rotten holes, and there is coarse breath with cold extremities, it is unfavorable. If the sore resembles a fish&#39;s navel, soft and puffy with a sunken, greyish-white top, with a thin pulse and cool body, it is mostly unfavorable; if already formed, with swollen flesh but the sore not rising, roots scattered, and the tip decayed and foul with blood and fluids, it indicates death. In general, for sores above the neck, needle punctures do not cause pain; below the neck, moxibustion does not cause pain, both indicate death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a condition arises above the neck, one must first use acupuncture to remove the bad blood, ensuring that the poison does not attack internally. When the condition arises below the neck, one must first use moxibustion to eliminate its force, so that it does not invade the healthy flesh. For fever and chills, with a tense and rapid pulse, indicating an external pathogen, it is appropriate to induce sweating to disperse it. If there is body heat, dry throat, strong pulse, and constipation, it is advisable to allow for a purgation. After acupuncture, if sores do not become rotten, and the swelling does not subside, additional internal medication should be applied. If initial moxibustion leads to unceasing yellow toxins, one must urgently use needling at the exit points to remove the bad blood. If there are chills and fever with dry retching, irritability and thirst, as well as confusion and faintness, it is necessary to detoxify and clear the heart, and protect the membranes. After a rupture, if qi and blood are injured, with lethargy and poor appetite, and restless sleep, it is advised to support the spleen and stomach to stabilize the spirit. As one nears recovery and qi and blood gradually return, food should be consumed. If there is still thirst, it is urgent to nourish the kidney water.<a id="trans-361p" href="#orig-361p" class="marker">[361p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Phlegmon</strong></p>
<p>Phlegmon arises when wounds fester for too long without healing, resulting in the stagnation of qi and blood, leading to a lack of nourishment for the bones. Fine bones accumulate toxins and transform into larger bones. This occurs from the mingling of essences and blood during conception, which will eventually lead to this condition. Since the kidneys govern the bones, it is advisable to take Kidney Qi Pills and Shiquan Dabu Decoction to first replenish the spleen and kidneys; then apply moxa sticks wrapped in mugwort and attach them to warm the area, causing the necrotic and decayed bones to naturally shed, allowing new flesh to grow and the wound to heal. </p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:<br>2 liang of Ground Cudrania, Astragalus, and Siler, 5 qian of Cinnamon, 1 liang each of Peony, Scutellaria, Atractylodes, Poria, Ginseng, Licorice, Angelica, and Stephania.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong>:<br>Crush and mix the above ingredients. First, take 1 jin of Atractylodes and boil it in 5 sheng of water until reduced to 3 sheng. Remove the Atractylodes residue, then add the twelve ingredients above and boil again until there&#39;s about 3 to 4 cups of clear liquid. Strain this to make 3 or 4 doses to be taken throughout the day. Additionally, brew a soup from the Atractylodes residue, remove the residue, and then take the decoction of the twelve ingredients.</p>
<p>This method eliminates dampness, disperses heat, and harmonizes the stomach qi. If the condition persists, prepare half the original dosage. For constipation and irritability, take a small amount of Huang Lian decoction; if there is mild diarrhea and irritation has subsided, take half of the re-brewed powder. By following these instructions, both the protective and nutritive energies will operate harmoniously, preventing the intrusion of evil energy into the internal space.<a id="trans-363p" href="#orig-363p" class="marker">[363p]</a></p></div>

Grind seven cloves of white cloves into a paste, mix with water drawn fresh, take it down, and cover with clothing to sleep, avoiding drafts. Sweating is good for recovery. Severe pain, akin to swelling from a headless sore, will resolve in no more than three doses and will have immediate effects. After taking the medicine, consume plain porridge and melon, then sleep—it&#39;s wonderfully effective.<a id="trans-368p" href="#orig-368p" class="marker">[368p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a boil or sore has not yet burst, apply ground cold water to the painful area and take it internally. After a while, if you feel itching, it will gradually dissipate. For ailments related to the dual poisons of yin and yang, such as feeling heavy in the chest from a cold or speaking irrationally, if the evil poison has not yet erupted, and in cases of pestilence or miasma that constricts the throat, mix cold water with a leaf of peppermint and grind it together. In urgent situations where one is disoriented, shouting and running about, as well as experiences of ghostly fears, consume this mixture with warm, unburnt liquor. If someone has hanged themselves or drowned, and shows warmth in the heart, or has been frightened to death by ghostly encounters and has not been dead overnight, administer the ground mixture with cold water. For injuries from snakes, dogs, or centipedes, apply the ground mixture with cold water to the affected area. In cases of abdominal swelling or confusion, it is especially advisable to take this remedy. For all kinds of intermittent fevers, regardless of whether they are new or old, brew a decoction of peach and willow branches and take it. For children experiencing sudden or chronic convulsions, as well as various forms of diarrhea, grind a leaf of peppermint with honey water and administer it. If the jaw is clenched tightly, grind a pill for both external application and internal consumption, adjusting the amount according to size. For toothaches, grind with liquor and apply it, while also swallowing a little. For burns from fire or boiling water, apply ground water from the East River to the affected area. For injuries from strikes or falls, consume fried pine resin mixed with liquor. For chronic headaches in the temples, use liquor mixed with peppermint to grind paper flowers and apply them to the temples, and consume this as well. For all kinds of epilepsy, where the mouth and eyes are askew, eyelids flutter, there is excessive salivation at night, speech is slurred, one might suddenly suffer a stroke with a locked jaw, clenching of the muscles, swelling in bones and joints, pain in hands and feet, and difficulty in walking, use liquor to grind and take this remedy.

Use Xiangfuzi by cleaning it of hair, soaking it in fresh ginger juice overnight, then drying and grinding it extremely fine. Take two qian mixed with white soup at any time. It is said that many cases of carbuncles arise from anger. If experiencing such a condition, there will likely be a lot of anger, but just taking Xiangfuzi and eating to relieve qi will be effective.</p>
<p><strong>Yuan Zhi Jiu</strong>: This remedy treats all types of boils, carbuncles, abscesses, and severe toxic conditions. If there is dead blood or hidden toxins inside, it may not hurt; applying the remedy will cause pain. If there is emotional distress like anger causing internal obstruction, the pain will be unbearable; applying it will alleviate the pain. If there is internal heat causing sensitivity, the application will bring coolness. If qi is deficient and blood weak, leading to non-healing wounds, or if there is internal emotional repression, treating it will surely bring recovery. Prepare Yuan Zhi by soaking it in an adequate amount of water, then pounding it into a powder. Mix three qian of the powder into a cup of wine, strain, and drink the clear liquid while applying the residue to the affected area.</p>
<p><strong>Wu Xiang San</strong>: This remedy regulates the ascending and descending of qi, opens and benefits the three burners, alleviates stagnation, dissipates evil heat, and treats the stasis of yin and yang qi, toxins that create heat, swollen painful lumps, or conditions resembling boils but not true ones, leading to headaches, nausea, and chills with urgent heat. The components include equal parts of Mu Xiang, Ding Xiang, Chen Xiang, Ru Xiang, and Huo Xiang.

Taking a hundred pills in a day is effective, able to prevent internal toxic attacks, especially protective of the membrane. It is best to take half a pound continuously. It is especially good to take after the wound has healed.</p>
<p><strong>Disinfectant Powder</strong>: For treating weak gastric qi, or when due to blockage it cannot dissolve, taking this will allow it to dissolve if not formed, and will burst if it has formed, allowing rotten flesh to fall away and new flesh to grow. If the rotten flesh has ruptured but new flesh cannot heal, those with qi deficiency should use the Four Gentlemen Decoction as the main treatment, while those with blood deficiency should use the Four Substances Decoction as the main treatment, and if both qi and blood are deficient, the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction should be used as the main treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The above-mentioned powdered medicines should be packaged separately for use according to the condition of the wounds.</p>
<p>For initial cases of sores such as furunculosis or carbuncles, as well as all types of swellings and toxins, and for treating the effects of exogenous pathogens: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cang&#39;er grass root</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tu&#39;er grass root</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jin yin teng (Silver vine) flowers can also be used</strong></li>
<li><strong>Five-flavored fruit root</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each ingredient should be of equal parts. The above should be ground and taken in a dosage of five qian, mixed with two cups of raw white wine, and boiled down to seven parts. Strain and consume the liquid while warm, taking care to extract any residual juice. The residue can be reboiled.</p>
<p>For treating all types of boils and abscesses, regardless of whether they are on the back or shoulder and cause pain, this formula proves highly effective: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jing Jie (Schizonepeta)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mint</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mountain centipede</strong></li>
<li><strong>Old man&#39;s beard</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tian hua fen (Trichosanthes root)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mushroom slices</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mushroom seeds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Withered lotus heart</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chuan Bai Zhi (Angelica)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Red peony</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pig&#39;s teeth soap pod cut and stir-fried</strong>, in equal parts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use one large Huai Wu for decoction, double the quantity of red inner powder, and add each fifteen wen of licorice, with an additional one if desired for sweetness. </p>
<p>This mixture should be ground into powder, with an intake of two qian mixed in mint tea for clarity. If a quick effect is desired, consume with wine. If no results are seen after several days, it is likely that the cold medicine is obstructing the blood flow; Alternately, you may add ingredients like Dang Gui (Chinese angelica) and Qiang Huo (Notopterygium). If there is excessive heat, use realgar mixed with wine. For breast abscesses, add Xuan Cao root juice for mixing. The remainder can be consumed with either wine or a soup made by decocting Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogon) after removing the core, though this is a slower remedy.<a id="trans-396p" href="#orig-396p" class="marker">[396p]</a></p></div>

All ingredients are to be ground into a fine powder.

It is suitable for replenishing the spleen and stomach, and the various symptoms will resolve on their own. If one mistakenly uses a purging remedy, seven misfortunes will follow: weakness of the spleen and stomach, reduced appetite, difficulty in digesting food, nausea, or unsatisfactory bowel movements.

However, if one uses yin-replenishing formulas, the spleen and stomach may be harmed, resulting in a surge of symptoms. If the fire of Mingmen (the Gate of Life) is weak and the spleen earth is cold and deficient, one must use the Eight Flavor Pill to replenish the Earth Mother. </p>

<p>Five parts of pearl, twelve-month-old cow dung for use; remaining months burned to preserve its properties; iron rust each weighing one tael.

Avoid consuming any toxic substances.</p>
<p>Mai Fan Shi Gao: Apply around the wound after pus has discharged.</p>
<p>For Mai Fan Shi, no fixed amount is required; calcine over charcoal until red, then quench in good vinegar. Repeat this calcination several times, grinding it into powder. Sift out the coarse parts, use the fine powder in a mortar, and grind thoroughly with several people for five to seven days until it becomes extremely fine. Grind Bai Lian into a fine powder as well. For deer horn, avoid those that have naturally shed; use only those that still have the brain and bone intact. Cut them into two- or three-inch lengths, burn them to eliminate smoke, then grind and sift for a fine powder. </p>
<p>Combine two taels of finely ground Mai Fan Shi, two taels of Bai Lian powder, and four taels of deer horn ash. It is crucial to grind them to an extremely fine consistency for effectiveness. Coarse powders can lead to severe pain, while fine ones can alleviate pain, close wounds, and expel pus; thus, the distinction between fine and coarse is vital.<a id="trans-423p" href="#orig-423p" class="marker">[423p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To determine the amount of medicinal powder needed, take high-quality rice vinegar and put it into a silver container. Heat it until it bubbles like fish eyes, then gradually add the medicinal powder while continuously stirring with a bamboo stick. After simmering for one to two hours, achieve the desired consistency, then transfer it to a ceramic vessel to cool. Cover it with paper to prevent dust.</p>
<p>Before using, wash away any pus and blood with pig trotter soup, then dry the area with a clean cloth. Use a goose feather dipped in ointment to apply around the wound, covering all red areas while leaving the center about the size of a coin exposed. If the wound is not yet open, this method can help it heal from within; if it is already open, the pus will drain out like rushing water, and the wound will gradually close.</p>
<p>For longstanding wounds where muscle has rotted and tendons are exposed, apply a piece of old cloth with medicine over the wound, taking care not to break the inner membrane, which can also provide relief. When cleaning the wound, avoid touching the tender flesh and do not blow on it with your breath. </p>
<p>Also, avoid having anyone with underarm odor or menstruating pregnant women nearby while preparing the medicine. You can also boil a large bowl of good rice vinegar, store it in a ceramic container, and use it daily on the wound. If the medicine dries out over time, use the goose feather to lightly wipe the medicine with vinegar, ensuring it doesn&#39;t become tight.</p>
<p>Initially, change the dressing and wash the wound once a day; after ten days, switch to every other day.<a id="trans-424p" href="#orig-424p" class="marker">[424p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Realgar Detoxification Powder</strong>: Treats all kinds of boils, swellings, and severe toxic conditions. First, use this medicine two to three times, then follow with pig&#39;s trotter soup. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingredients</strong>: 4 taels of alum, 1 tael each of realgar and calcined cold water stone. Use 2 to 3 bowls of boiling water, while hot add 1 tael of the previous medicine. Wash the affected area and apply Taiyi ointment or Shenyi ointment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pig’s Trotter Soup</strong>: Treats all boils and toxic swellings, dispels toxic qi, and eliminates foul flesh. For any wound with an opening, use this soup for washing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Equal parts of: raw white angelica, yellow root without hearts, red peony root, qianghuo, bee’s nest with live bees, raw licorice, and others. Grind into coarse powder, adjusting the dosage according to the size of the boil. If the boil is large, increase the ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, take two front trotters of a wild pig weighing one jin, using only 3 liters of plain water to boil until soft. Divide the juice into two portions, clarifying the surface oil and removing the sediment and meat. For each usage, take 1 tael of medicine and add to the juice, then simmer with steady heat until boiling numerous times. Remove dregs, and use clean cloth to soak in the medicinal soup. Gently and gradually apply it to the wound; dead flesh and foul blood will wash away accordingly. After cleaning, dry the area with cloth. Avoid wind and do not let breath blown from the mouth touch it. Individuals with foul body odor, menstruating women, and chickens or dogs are not allowed to enter the patient&#39;s room. Avoid touching the wound with hands during washing. Many methods exist to wash abscesses, but this recipe is especially effective. The use of bee’s nest serves a purpose, driving out poison with poison.<a id="trans-426p" href="#orig-426p" class="marker">[426p]</a></p></div>

<p>Three qian each of Bai Zhi, Huo Xiang, Mao Xiang, Xiang Fu Zi, and Fang Feng; one qian each of Mu Xiang and Gan Cao. Prepare into one dose, using three bowls of water. Boil until it has reduced, strain, and wash the affected area.</p>
<p>For fumigation and washing: For all hair, places of pus, carbuncles, swollen lymph nodes, sores, or conditions accompanied by a foul odor that is unbearable, these are the worst afflictions. Whether already ruptured or not, small or large, urgent treatment is required. Use a handful of honeysuckle vine, pound finely, and filter its juice with ashless wine to drink. Apply the residue around the wound, using ground muscovite ointment for extra protection. You may also cut a larger opening to protect the wound above, waiting for it to produce pus. Then, thoroughly cleanse it with an absolute and pure wash like pig hoof broth, washing persistently for a duration of one or two hours. Following this, use the medicinal fumigation.</p>
<p>For the incense mixture, take two flavors: fine powder of sandalwood and fragrant maple. Mix these two in a pan evenly, rolling into balls the size of bullets. Then, take a censer and fashion a paper smoke tube for the opening. Like burning ambergris, use a slow fire to combust it, placing the tube firmly over the sore. The number of balls is not fixed; if tired, pause briefly, then resume fumigation. If pus has yet to emerge, it will appear; if it has emerged, let it dry, and wait for the flesh to heal before stopping. If there is still redness and swelling, continue to fumigate.

After a needle opens the sore, if it closes and produces pus, causing intolerable swelling and pain, take this and form it into the size of a millet grain, place it inside the sore, and it will never close. The pus will flow out on its own, and the sore will dry up and heal.</p>
<p>For a highly effective remedy: one coin each of realgar, orpiment, and vermilion, and a little slaked lime. Grind these into a fine powder, make into pills the size of wheat grains, and if the sore&#39;s opening closes and pus forms, put the medicine inside and apply a medicated plaster.</p>
<p>Cyanine Pills: Also known as Effective Cyanine Pills. This treats brain sores, back sores, and ulcers, promoting the outflow of pus and growth of flesh. Use four coins of blue vitriol, dried alum, Shao powder, frankincense (prepared separately), and indigo, one and a half coins each, white lilac and true slaked lime, one coin each, half a coin of musk, and twenty-seven peeled apricot seeds, ground separately. If there is necrotic tissue, add one coin of white clove. </p>
<p>Grind these into a fine powder, mix with a thick paste to form cakes, or you can also mix with glutinous rice, adjusting the depth of the paste until the sore calms down. It can still be used afterward, with remarkable effectiveness. The previous remedies should not be used excessively, as they may cause issues with arsenic. This medicine is non-toxic, but to dispel any doubts from the patient about it being poison, one may taste it as evidence.<a id="trans-431p" href="#orig-431p" class="marker">[431p]</a></p></div>

<li>5 qian of white wax (using 1 tael of yellow wax is even more effective).</li>

<p>It is commonly seen that those who frequently battle in lawsuits, after being struck, take a small amount of wax along with one to two bowls of alcohol. After a night&#39;s rest, their blood disperses and the pain ceases; in lighter cases, the issues resolve completely, and even severe cases, though ulcerated, heal easily.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the medicinal paste is too rare, boil it a little longer. It is essential to wait for the right condition before sealing it in porcelain ware for storage. If there is a fear of accidental overheating that makes it too hard to use, add a bit of wax while simmering and mix in sesame oil. Seal it in porcelain, steam it above water, and stir it while hot until homogeneous, then store it for use. Once the paste is prepared, place the porcelain container in a clean basin of water to eliminate the fire&#39;s residual toxicity for a full day and night, then leave it to rest for three days before use. Preparing this paste is very challenging in terms of heat; one must be patient and observe the fire closely, as too fierce a flame will cause it to burn. Be extremely cautious.

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.5 pounds of asphalt</li>
<li>2 ounces each of Xuanwu, yellow wax</li>
<li>1 ounce each of myrrh and frankincense, to be ground separately</li>
<li>4 to 7 seeds of tortoise shell, sliced and ground</li>
<li>100 castor beans, ground</li>
<li>2 ounces of sesame oil in summer, 3 ounces in spring and autumn, and 4 ounces in winter</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:<br>Firstly, combine asphalt and Xuanwu in a pot and melt them, stirring with branches of Sophora and willow until it reaches a dark, charred color. Strain through cotton, pour the asphalt into a basin of water, let it cool into blocks, and weigh out 2 pounds of the pure substance. Then return it to the pot, melt it down again, and add sesame oil, yellow wax, castor bean paste, and the ground tortoise shell. Continuously stir with the willow branch, ensuring the mixture can drop into water without sticking to the hands, and can be pulled to resemble golden threads. If it becomes too hard, add a little oil; if too soft, add more asphalt. Once the proper consistency is achieved, add the powdered myrrh and take the pot off the heat. Stir vigorously with the willow branch hundreds of times, then filter the ointment with coarse cloth in the basin, pulling it into golden strands while frequently changing the water for a day. Finally, use a small scoop to store it.</p>
<p>For injuries resembling falls from horses or vehicles, heat the affected area to the bone and test for tenderness, bathing it in hot water multiple times until the stagnation of blood dissipates. For children&#39;s spleen disorders, apply to the affected area, for diarrhea apply on the stomach, and for coughs apply on the back.<a id="trans-437p" href="#orig-437p" class="marker">[437p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>First, use three inches of scallion white, have the patient chew it thoroughly and spit it into the palm of their hand. Men should use the left side and women the right. Wrap the medicinal pellets in the scallion white and swallow them down with three to four cups of warm, ash-free wine. Then, take shelter from the wind and cover the patient with clothing. After about five miles of walking, take several cups of hot wine to enhance the effects of the medicine, prompting warmth and profuse sweating. At first, the two pills will dissolve. If sweating does not occur, in severe cases, take another two pills; sweating will indicate efficacy. If the illness is severe after three to five days, take another two pills to achieve recovery. If there are deep sores that turn yellow and reach the heart, they are difficult to treat, and if sweating occurs and turns cold, it could be fatal. If the patient cannot chew the scallion, crush it, wrap the pills inside, and swallow it down with hot wine. If the sores are above, take the medicine after meals; if below, take it before meals. After consuming this medicine, avoid cold water, cucumbers, eggplants, greasy pig, chicken, fish, meat, wet flour, and all wind-triggering or sore-causing substances. Additionally, avoid women washing or changing clothes. This remedy works reliably for fox odor and is highly effective. This medicine has saved many lives.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ji Sheng Jin Sha San</strong> for treating carbuncles.</p>
<p>The Daoist practitioner lightly fries the main ingredient, 1 tael. Additionally, use 3.5 qian of Cang Erzi, 3 qian of Xionghuang, and a generous amount of Chan Su. First, prick the area around the sore and mix the powdered medicine with oil to apply inside the wound. Seal it with scarlet silk; within a few days, the carbuncle will naturally exit. If the sore has penetrated into the abdomen causing nausea and vomiting, drink juice from Cang Erzi.</p>
<p><strong>Tie Guan Gao</strong> treats all internal toxins of severe sores. This medicine alleviates pain and expels dead tissue. Combine one bowl each of mulberry wood ash, buckwheat stalk ash, and lime, along with a small amount of charcoal ash. Use a clay pot, drill a hole at the bottom side, and seal it. Fill the pot with the aforementioned ashes, add water to fill it, and securely cover with thick paper. For a while, insert a bamboo tube into the pot hole, allowing the water to drain without using the ash. Slowly boil the drained ash water in a pot over low heat, stirring continuously with an iron spatula until it reaches a consistency that doesn’t scatter when dripped. Store it in a sealed iron pot. This can be applied to various sores and intestinal wind hemorrhoids as needed.</p>
<p>Another prescription involves pricking the head of the carbuncle with a needle and knife, applying Chan Su afterward.</p>
<p>Wild chrysanthemum, bulrush root, and beet leaves should be ground finely and mixed with plenty of ash-free wine for taking. Once sober, the carbuncle will dissolve into water, and the pain will subside. If the heat is eliminated, there&#39;s no need to remove the carbuncle; it will heal on its own.<a id="trans-486p" href="#orig-486p" class="marker">[486p]</a></p></div>

<p>Toad fat pill for treating boils and abscesses: if toxic qi attacks the heart causing a near-fatal condition, use a needle to pierce the sore directed towards the heart. If pain is felt and blood comes out, insert the pill. If successive punctures near the heart side cause no pain or bleeding, urgently needle the Baihui point. If there is pain and blood, insert the pill. If there is no blood, use the hot blood of a loved one as a substitute; it is still effective in three out of ten cases. Initially, when it appears, there are no failures. Generally, boils most severely arise on the chest, back, and head. Initially, they itch and hurt intermittently, sink like a nail, and have a root that makes it feel like it is shaking. Severe heat and aversion to food accompany them.</p>
<p>Ingredients include: southern star (dried plant), winter flower, castor bean seeds, yellow cinnabar, and white arsenic, each one penny; five parts of angelica; ten centipedes with heads and legs removed. These should be ground into a very fine powder, mixed with fresh toad fat to form balls the size of millet grains. Each time a boil appears, first use a needle to pierce it, ensuring no pain is felt. If blood comes out, insert the pill; if pain is felt, there is no need to use it again. If still no pain is felt, continue to poke along the path of the sore until blood is seen to indicate pain, then stop. The original sore will also ache; apply a medicated plaster to have pus drain naturally. </p>
<p>For the pill method, use a fine silver tube about three inches long; puncture down to the painful area of the sore with the needle, then push the medicine contained in a fine silver wire within the tube to the painful location.</p>

<p>Single prescription:</p>
<p>Yuan Zhi Wine: Treats all abscesses, carbuncles, and toxic boils. If there is stagnation due to dead blood, it will not be painful unless applied; if internal evil is present, then pain will be unbearable, but applying will relieve it; if blood is congested within, causing internal heat that feels oppressive, the hand cannot approach; applying will surely bring relief. If there is deficiency of qi and cold blood, leading to ulceration that does not close, or if emotional distress is accumulated internally, the remedy will cure it. Yuan Zhi is used without regard to amount; soak, pound to a pulp, and dry to a powder. Mix three qian of this powder with one cup of wine, strain, and drink it, applying the residue to the affected area.</p>
<p>Lonicera Vine Wine: Treats injuries from consuming rich foods or excessive hot substances, and sores caused by long-term use of mineral supplements. It can be taken preventively. For fresh Lonicera vine, five liang; for dried, one liang; one liang of licorice root segments; prepare one dose with three ghouls of water, boil down to two ghouls, then add one cup of good quality wine without ash, boil again for over ten bubbles, strain the residue, and divide into three doses for consumption. For those who can drink alcohol, take it all at once. Additionally, take the vine, crush it, and mix with wine to apply to the affected area; leave it while the toxin is expelled, then reapply after it dries.

For those not fully developed, take two to three doses; for fully developed cases, take one to two doses.</p>
<p><strong>Boils and Abscesses</strong>: Use Jin Zhen San (Golden Needle Powder). Obtain a mixture of soap pod needles, with half collected in spring and half black ones—no specific amount is necessary. Dry, grind into a powder, and take two to three qian mixed with wine after meals.</p>
<p><strong>Boils, Abscesses, and Pain Without a Head</strong>: Use a powder made from fritillary bulb, pangolin scales, and tianhuafen (a type of tuber).

This can be combined with the previous prescription.</p>

Cook in a silver vessel over a slow fire until it becomes a paste, and store it. Take one to two spoonfuls with ash-free wine or clear broth.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Surgical Abscesses and Sores Doctrine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: When the energy of the abscess is stagnant, it should be removed with needles. When the energy is strong and the blood is congested, it should be drained using stones. In the eastern regions, the people eat fish and salty food, leading to abscess-related diseases, which should be treated with stone therapy. When the abscess has no definitive location, palpation does not yield results; it appears and disappears unpredictably. One should puncture the area next to the Taiyin point and the two points of the Jingmai. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: In acupuncture, if one does not penetrate properly, essence may leak; if one punctures incorrectly, it may lead to energy stagnation. Essence leakage results in worsening conditions and distress, while energy stagnation leads to the formation of abscesses. When treating the evil of abscesses, do not confront it head-on; it can easily change nature. If pus forms, the path may collapse, unsettling the area, leading to dispersion. For any excesses of yin and yang causing abscesses, one should focus on draining them. A fine needle should be as sharp as a sword&#39;s edge to draw out substantial pus. </p>
<p>The onset of illness is often unpredictable, influenced by emotions like joy and anger, irregular eating habits, insufficient yin energy, excessive yang energy, and stagnant nutrients, which lead to abscess formation. When yin and yang are blocked, and two heats clash, they turn into pus. Can a small needle extract it? Qi Bo said: To treat small issues with small methods yields little effect; treating larger issues with large methods often brings more harm. Therefore, once pus and blood have formed, only stone therapy and fine needles can draw them out. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: A swelling in the neck makes it hard to look up or down; cheek swelling can pull the ear, treat it with the governing bone point. For a swollen throat that makes speech difficult, treat it with the Tian Zhu point.<a id="trans-530p" href="#orig-530p" class="marker">[530p]</a></p></div>

However, there is no record of this moxibustion method in &quot;Thousand Gold&quot;; the earliest documentation is in the &quot;Emergency Moxibustion Method&quot; authored by the renowned person Wen Renqiannian during the Song Dynasty, which includes a special section on bamboo horse moxibustion.

Have the patient lean on a table with their elbow, straightening the wrist; use a strip of slender bamboo, measuring from the bend at the wrist to the tip of the middle finger, cutting off the excess and not measuring the fingernail. Then, take a bamboo pole, have the patient undress, and sit firmly on it, with two people lifting them off the ground, ensuring their feet do not touch the ground, and have two others support them, keeping them upright. The bamboo strip measured should be placed from the sitting position on the bamboo pole down to the coccyx, then directly along the spine to the end of the measured strip; use ink to mark this point, which is merely for positioning and is not an acupuncture point.<a id="trans-532p" href="#orig-532p" class="marker">[532p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Instead, use thin bamboo strips as a measuring tool to gauge the knuckle joint of the patient’s middle finger, with the distance between the two horizontal lines as the standard. For males, measure on the left; for females, on the right. Cut it to one standard length, then measure from the marked point on both sides to find another standard length; the ends will indicate the acupuncture points. Each point should be cauterized five to seven times. If an abscess appears on the left, cauterize the right; if on the right, cauterize the left; if severe, cauterize both sides. This is because these two points correspond with the heart meridian; all abscesses and swellings are due to the stagnation of heart fire and poison. Cauterizing here allows the heart fire to circulate and the poison to dissipate. This method has repeatedly demonstrated its life-saving effectiveness.</p>
<p>For abscesses that have or have not burst, take three sheng of fragrant bean and mash it with a little water to form a paste. Shape this paste into a cake according to the size of the swelling, three-tenths of an inch thick. If the wound has a hole, do not cover it. Place the bean cake on top and burn mugwort sticks above it, ensuring it remains warm but does not burn the flesh. If there’s heat and pain, replace it urgently. The affected area will feel lighter and more comfortable. Cauterize twice a day. If a hole is already present, letting out the juice is most beneficial. This is the bean cake cauterization method, mentioned in the &quot;Thousand Gold Supplement,&quot; Volume Twenty-Three, addressing the same topic but with slight differences in wording.</p>
<p>The &quot;Three Causes Formula&quot; states that when an abscess or swelling is first felt, it should be covered with a damp paper. Looking carefully, the first dry area indicates the head. Place sliced garlic on the head and cauterize with a large mugwort torch three times, then replace with another piece of garlic. Cauterize until the pain is relieved, or continue until pain is felt to stop. Generally, a hundred cauterizations is the standard. It is most crucial to recognize early and begin cauterizing promptly.<a id="trans-533p" href="#orig-533p" class="marker">[533p]</a></p></div>

<p>For issues arising from the brain, only the &quot;Jue Gu&quot; point should be used, which is located three inches above the outer ankle in the artery. For early-stage carbuncles or abscesses that feel slightly swollen, with hardened skin and a deep pulse without pain, one should perform external moxibustion to expel the pathogenic qi. The classics state that for issues occurring below the surface, moxibustion is indicated. If one feels a slight hardness without pain, urgent moxibustion is required, as the pathogenic qi has deeply settled; if it is shallow, moxibustion should not be performed. If there is pus, moxibustion is also not indicated; needling is warranted.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;De Xiao Fang&quot;: When a carbuncle or abscess initially flares up and grows larger, place a piece of damp paper on the wound, and the point that dries first is the primary location. First, wash it with water to remove any salty skin, and place a large pen-tube aligned over the primary location, then insert a large leech inside. Frequently pour cold water over it; the leech should suck out the pus and blood from the precise point, with the skin wrinkling and the tissue turning pale, indicating that the poison has dispersed effectively. If the poison is large and the leech is small, three to four leeches should be used to achieve results. If bleeding does not stop, apply mud from lotus stems to the area.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Zi Sheng Fang&quot;: Those skilled in treating carbuncles and abscesses typically use moxibustion on the wound two to three hundred times, with all cases achieving resolution.<a id="trans-535p" href="#orig-535p" class="marker">[535p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When using moxa sticks for small ailments, a gentler approach causes less fear of the treatment; if used excessively, the effects will surely manifest. When a hard, unyielding lump is encountered, known as a &quot;stone sore,&quot; apply strong moxibustion over it to break apart the stone within. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan,&quot; when a sore first appears on the back, signifying potential development, it is red, hot, swollen, and painful. First, cover it with moist paper, then observe where it dries first—that spot indicates the head of the sore. Take garlic, slice it into pieces about the thickness of three coins, place it on the head, and perform strong moxibustion three times, replacing with a new slice of garlic each time. Apply moxibustion until the pain subsides; if there is no pain, continue until it begins to hurt. It is best to treat early. In one to two days, ten treatments yield ten recoveries; in three to four days, six to seven recoveries; by five to six days, three to four recoveries. After ten or more days, moxibustion is no longer advisable. </p>
<p>If multiple heads arise in one spot, crush garlic into a paste and form a thin cake. Place it on the head and burn moxa over it, which can also yield effective results. If a red swelling first appears, and there is a yellow, corn-like head in the middle, take a single clove of garlic, cut off both ends, and slice the middle part to place on the sore head. Apply moxibustion fourteen to a maximum of forty-nine times. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Heart Method of Danxi,&quot; the emergence of sores is either due to internal accumulated heat or external cold combined with internal heat. By applying moxibustion to the site of development to disperse its toxicity, early treatment can change a deep issue into a shallow one, alleviating severity into mildness.<a id="trans-536p" href="#orig-536p" class="marker">[536p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All methods of moxibustion are good, but the riding bamboo horse moxibustion method is particularly crucial, as it prevents ailments before they manifest. If moxibustion is applied excessively, one should take powdered milk internally to prevent the fire from entering the heart. The &quot;Medical Cliff Original General” states: sores that enter from the outside should not be treated with moxibustion; those that emerge from the inside should be treated. External invasions should be expelled rather than treated internally, while internal discharges should be guided outward. Therefore, the classic says: &quot;If it is trapped, moxibustion should be applied.&quot; If moxibustion does not cause pain, one should cease when it becomes painful. If it does not hurt, it must have already reached the ulcer, hence the lack of pain; afterwards, it reaches healthy flesh, hence the pain arises. If moxibustion causes pain, one should stop once the pain alleviates. If it is painful, it must first reach the pre-ulcerative stage; subsequently, it affects areas about to ulcerate, thus not inducing pain. </p>
<p>According to Xue Ji&#39;s medical case studies, Wu states: &quot;For moxibustion with garlic cakes, garlic&#39;s spicy, warm, and toxic properties primarily disperse sores and abscesses, using the heat to activate the medicinal effects.&quot; For those who only use moxa cones, this can be applied to stubborn ulcers, or similar conditions. For all cases of red, swollen, and darkly toxic sores, moxibustion with garlic and moxa together is ideal. </p>
<p>In treating abscesses, furuncles, and carbuncles, if initial moxibustion causes pain, it indicates the toxic gases are superficial; if there is no pain, the toxicity is deeper. Both cases should involve internal medication to eliminate toxins and pus, and external applications to disinfect. Generally, abscesses should not be painless; if they are overwhelmingly painful, or if one is disoriented and feels no pain, treatment becomes difficult.<a id="trans-537p" href="#orig-537p" class="marker">[537p]</a></p></div>

However, if sores appear on the crown of the head, one should use the bamboo horse method and moxibustion at the acupuncture point Zusanli. Sores and ulcers must manifest externally if there are internal issues; those on the outside should be drawn out, while internal ones should be dispersed and drained. The effects of moxibustion are significant. If toxic energy becomes stagnant and blood coagulates, lighter cases might be relieved with medicinal herbs, but in severe cases, medicine cannot work effectively. Dongyuan stated: If one does not use acupuncture or cautery, the toxic energy cannot be resolved. Therefore, those skilled in treating toxins must use garlic isolation moxibustion. Using harsh, cold remedies to dispel toxins can be effective for those with substantial internal heat, but for those who are weak and have deficient energy, failure is inevitable. Additionally, if toxic energy is hidden, whether due to age or weakness, or from taking harmful medications that further deplete energy, resulting in pus that does not discharge, one must rely on the power of fire to achieve success. Generally, in acupuncture and moxibustion, if there is no discharge, one should draw out the stagnant toxins; if it has discharged, one should restore the Yang energy and eliminate cold pathogenic influence, allowing the sore to close naturally. This method is particularly effective for treating sores in the limbs due to insufficient energy and blood. For such cases, the aforementioned moxibustion method is adequate for healing. In cases of severe abscess, moxibustion is especially advisable, as heat toxins trapped within create a barrier, and without proper release, they cannot be dispersed. If one is in a poor and isolated situation with no medicine available, garlic isolation moxibustion is particularly convenient, changing the garlic slices every three uses, typically capping at around one hundred uses.<a id="trans-538p" href="#orig-538p" class="marker">[538p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Using garlic for its pungency can disperse, and using mugwort for its fiery properties can promote penetration. If these methods are applied through moxibustion, the sore will inevitably fester and break down, followed by applying a miraculous ointment, leading to self-healing in no time. This method not only prevents the sore from becoming large but also preserves the internal flesh, allowing the sore&#39;s opening to close easily, showing remarkable effects. Danxi said: &quot;The head is where all yang energies converge; therefore, mugwort should be used in small and limited amounts.&quot;</p>
<p>For sores that do not break, they should be prodded to break. For those not festering, they should be supplemented to promote festering, preventing internal attacks. When the pus forms, timely needling will lead to healing in less than a few weeks. Patients often fear the pain of needles and refuse treatment, or they worry about damaging the flesh. They do not realize that though the sore emerges in thin flesh, if the pus forms, it will swell a couple of inches high, and the skin of the sore will thicken; using a needle, the depth should not exceed two-tenths of an inch. If it arises on the back, the swelling may be two to three inches high, and the needle should only enter about an inch deep. Moreover, when the affected flesh is already damaged, what pain is there? What is there to worry about in terms of injury?</p>
<p>For timid or weak individuals, or those suffering from bone-related abscesses, waiting for the pus to drain naturally often leads to severe ruptures that cannot heal and result in the loss of vital energy and blood, leading to many deaths. Once a sore has formed pus, the skin should not be loosely vented, yet some foolish individuals wait for it to rupture on their own. They fail to understand that younger and more robust individuals might be able to self-resolve. However, for the elderly and weak, with depleted vital energy and blood, or those who excessively induce attacks, not using needling allows the pathogenic toxicity to exploit the situation and attack internally, leading to severe consequences.<a id="trans-539p" href="#orig-539p" class="marker">[539p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If poison has settled in the limbs, and the acupuncture is not effective, then the decay will be deep and significant, making it difficult to contain. When poison accumulates in critical areas such as the cheeks, neck, chest, and abdomen, regardless of whether the person is strong or weak, urgent puncturing is required; otherwise, it will be hard to treat. Generally, the manifestations of sores and ulcers vary in severity, with deep or shallow presentations. Shallow ones are swollen, raised, and soft, arising from the blood vessels; deep ones, however, are swollen, hardened, and arise from the tendons and bones. There are also those that arise from the marrow, where the skin and flesh remain unchanged. Thus, the ancients devised methods where shallow cases should be treated with scraping and deep cases should be pierced, to eliminate stagnant blood at the onset of the poison accumulation for easier resolution. If pus has formed and the vital energy is strong, it may naturally drain out. For those who are weak and timid, needling is not recommended, as few escape regret. When sores and ulcers penetrate the membrane, there is a ten to one chance of death; even using major tonics cannot save them, thus this serves as a warning to await the pus to drain out. Therefore, Dongyuan states: if the toxic qi cannot be resolved and the pus and stagnation cannot be released, and time passes without treatment, it will turn inward and harm the internal organs. Once the internal decay occurs, how can one hope for survival? I will share one or two examples for my colleagues and alert the patients to be cautious. </p>
<p>If treating symptoms of insufficient vital energy, at the onset of the condition, one should internally use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to warmly nourish the spleen and stomach; externally, use mulberry branches and green onions for steaming, to help restore the yang energy for natural dissipation.<a id="trans-540p" href="#orig-540p" class="marker">[540p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it has been a long time without pus formation, one should employ the previous two methods as supplements to hasten it. If pus has already formed but does not drain, moxa should be applied at the center with a few cones to draw it out, followed by taking a decoction of &quot;Ten Complete Tonics.&quot; </p>
<p>It is also noted: if there are ten or more pepper eyes in the abscess, or it resembles a honeycomb or lotus pod, and the pus and blood do not emerge, use a needle to puncture it both horizontally and vertically. If there are no such pepper eyes, simply puncture straight in to extract the pus without splitting. Applying moxa to each pepper eye is also a good method, and it is not necessary to split.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is stated: an abscess has thin skin and a high swelling, often with pepper-like granules; while a carbuncle has tough skin, resembling a cow&#39;s neck. When an abscess is ripe, it is appropriate to use a needle, preferably one made of horse bit iron, shaped like a chive leaf, sharp on both sides, capable of slicing five or six tenths of an inch, used to eradicate toxic blood. One must first apply moxa before puncturing. When a carbuncle is ripe, it is suitable for cauterization; a silver spatula about two inches wide and six inches long can be heated until red-hot and quickly applied to the toxic area to cauterize, resulting in the pus being expelled.</p>
<p>For already formed toxic gas, it is advisable to use a tool to hasten the emergence of pus; once the pus is formed, one must check its ripeness, depth, and state before using a needle. If the pus is ripe and a needle is used, the qi and blood will already have flowed out, making it difficult for additional pus to form; however, if the pus is ripe and not punctured, the necrosis will deepen, and the wound will be hard to close. If the wound is deep and the needle is shallow, the internal pus will not exit, and external blood will instead leak out; if the wound is shallow and the needle is deep, while the internal pus may exit, healthy flesh may become damaged.<a id="trans-541p" href="#orig-541p" class="marker">[541p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the vital energy is weak, one must first nourish before puncturing. Once the pus is released, the various symptoms will subside. However, if the pus is expelled and there is renewed pain, or if there is restlessness and vomiting, this is due to a deficiency in stomach energy, and urgent nourishment is required. If there is severe heat and toxins from back sores, with the central flesh darkened, internally use medicines to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and externally apply black gold ointment to the darkened area. As the red areas gradually rise and the dark areas gradually lower, within six or seven days, a boundary will be formed between the red and dark areas, with cracks appearing as if marked by a knife, and the dark flesh will begin to deteriorate. One should use fine needles to carefully cut away, ensuring that the patient feels no pain and no blood is seen. Even if there are cracks and pus has not fully flowed, or even if the pus and water have come out but there is still pain, this indicates that the inner pathways are not yet open, and needles should be used to draw it out along the cracks. If there is decay in the flesh between the shoulder blades and pus is released but swelling and pain persist, this indicates the presence of toxic filaments obstructing it, and the pus has not been fully released. It is especially important to draw this out. If the vital energy is weak and there is excessive use or loss of energy, and the affected area is not painful, or if the flesh appears to be dying, urgent warming and nourishing of the spleen and stomach is needed; there may still be a chance for recovery. In the end, pure nourishing medicines should be employed to help consolidate the healing.<a id="trans-542p" href="#orig-542p" class="marker">[542p]</a></p></div>

How can one expect to grow flesh and promote healing in such a state? </p>
<p>In the practice of acupuncture and moxibustion, there are rules concerning forbidden points and prohibited practices, including the prohibitions of using needles on certain days or during certain times. Violating these rules can lead to difficulties in healing, for this reasoning is indeed sound. However, when wounds and lesions have already harmed the vital energy and blood, and the muscles are damaged, it is better to confront and seize the problem in a straightforward manner. This is not to be compared to the acupuncture of a healthy individual, so what prohibitions need to be observed?</p>
<p>&quot;The Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: In the case of wounds and sores where poisonous energy cannot be resolved and pus and clots cannot be drained, the attack turns inward. When the interior has already decayed, how can one expect healing?

<p>As for the technique of &quot;earthworm needle,&quot; it is used to treat initial occurrences of boils and sores.

<p>For abscesses that have swollen greatly, resembling the shape of a turtle, observe the position of the head; first, apply moxibustion to the front legs, then to the tail.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The &#39;Principles of Treatment&#39; states: The method of acupuncture for treating carbuncles and sores involves the dispersal of red threads, with possible accumulation of toxic blood. Use a piece of fine ceramic, break it into sharp pieces, take one piece, split it with a chopstick, and secure it with a thread. With your fingers, lightly press the chopstick to align the sharp edge with the affected area, hanging about an inch above it. Then, use another chopstick to repeatedly strike the head of the first chopstick, allowing toxic blood to be released upon puncture. If the toxicity is deep within the belly, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Moxibustion is a method to break up blockages and hard masses. If there is a small white bump, like a grain of millet, surrounded by slight swelling like a coin, moxa should be applied directly to the grain for fourteen or fifteen treatments. If treated within three days, it will only form a sore and disperse; if treated after three days, the swelling will gradually decrease, so it is advisable to apply more moxibustion. If the moxa burns the area, the heat can extend the blockage, and if the treatment area ulcerates first, the toxicity will lessen, hopefully preventing further spread and avoiding damage to muscles, bones, and the blood.</p>
<p>When it is said that moxibustion is painless, it means that if it’s applied to skin and flesh that isn’t damaged, it will hurt; but if it reaches the toxic area, it will not hurt. Therefore, the heat must reach the toxic area to be effective. When it’s said that moxibustion causes pain, it means that the initial application to the toxic area is painless, but it hurts when the heat reaches healthy flesh; thus, the heat must reach healthy flesh to be effective.</p>
<p>Those who are afraid of moxibustion may use a clove of garlic, or a fermented soybean cake, or a paste made from mashed pepper, ginger, and salt, about the thickness of three coins, spread with moxa and treated. If it gets hot, replace it with a fresh cake, which can also aid in dispersing the condition.&quot;<a id="trans-547p" href="#orig-547p" class="marker">[547p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Cauterization is intended for treatment; only the head is where all yang energies converge, and the moxa should be small and few. If it involves the lesser yang regions, it is especially inadvisable to cauterize, as excessive cauterization may lead to no remedy. There are also instances of death resulting from cauterization. This occurs due to severe deficiency; solitary yang approaches extinction, and its pulse is bound to be floating, rapid, and large, while the spirit is bound to be short and murky, lacking the ability to withstand the fire&#39;s heat, which naturally leads to danger.</p>
<p>Liu Zonghou said: This refers to the early onset of boils and sores, where cauterization is advisable. However, for longstanding sores that cause pain, which often have continuous pus without an odor and no decayed flesh inside, it is more appropriate to soak with aconite, cut into large pieces, about two to three fen thick, and place them on the sore for moxa cauterization, while also taking internal medicinal remedies. Cauterization should be repeated every two to three days, and after five to seven times, the muscle will naturally fill in. For sores with foul pus and deep-rooted issues, the Guo family uses a combination of flour, sulfur, and garlic, all ground together. Depending on the size of the sore, form them into patties about three fen thick, and apply moxa cauterization twenty-one times, replacing it after each treatment. After four to five days, use the Qingxia pill and Xinxiao pill, alternating their use, and insert them into the sore until all decayed flesh is gone and healthy flesh emerges. Then, apply a consolidating medicine and take internal remedies suited to the condition, and with proper regulation, healing will follow.</p>
<p>Therefore, cauterization is not only appropriate at the initial onset of a sore. Generally, in the early stages, cauterization is indicated, and it is essential to supplement with medicines that contrast the condition while sweating and reducing. Even when cauterizing cold sores, effective internal remedies must be applied. If contrary treatments are used, not only will recovery fail, but it may also lead to the onset of other diseases.<a id="trans-548p" href="#orig-548p" class="marker">[548p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Needling and Cauterization</strong></p>
<p>When using needling and cauterization, first examine the depth and severity of the abscess and whether the pus is formed or not. A raised and soft area corresponds to the blood vessels; a flat and firm area relates to the tendons. If the skin color is indistinct, it originates from the bone marrow. For lightly raised areas, use a copper needle to incise them. If the abscess has just begun with white granules, it can be resolved; if it grows like a beehive, then cauterize the initial white granules and four or five surrounding areas. For those at the level of the skin, if the abscess is flat and shallow, it is appropriate to use a fire needle for cauterization. The needles should be round, similar to chopsticks or weft threads, thicker, with a rounded flat head, each around six to seven inches long, and two alike. Dip in fragrant oil and heat in charcoal until red hot, then cauterize near the base of the wound, angled into the softer area. If one cauterization does not penetrate, a second will yield pus. Cauterization at the wound opening is known as &quot;hot sore&quot;; pus flows without needing pressure to suppress it, using threads to keep the wound open. It was once common to use paper twist or freshly harvested root of the ox knee, sized to the wound, slightly scraping the skin, and tying one end with thread. It is better to use items like emerald green or pus-dispersing pills, mixing them with glutinous rice into soft strips, observing the depth for application, and externally applying detoxifying ointment. If the wound poison has not fully formed, cauterization may disperse it; if it has become ulcerated but not ruptured, needling can resolve it, but care must be taken to use the appropriate method.<a id="trans-549p" href="#orig-549p" class="marker">[549p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is to use a needle to cauterize but fails to do so, then the poison finds no outlet, pus collects and erodes the mucous membrane, rotting tendons and damaging bones, making it difficult to avoid. If the poison is deep and the needle is shallow, the pus cannot be expelled; if the poison is superficial and the cauterization is deep, it harms the healthy flesh. If not handled correctly, further issues arise, causing more pain. If an abscess has festered and does not heal over time, or if a chronic ulcer alternates between opening and closing, or if the mouth of the abscess does not close, it is all due to cold stagnation that prevents contraction, as well as cauterization from within and without the ulcer. </p>
<p>When an abscess is just beginning and when pus appears, with redness and swelling presenting, one should use a heated iron needle to cauterize the area and prick around it, and then the redness and swelling will shrink. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compilation&quot; states: &quot;The cauterization technique is best applied when the ulcer is ripe but not yet ruptured; using iron to cauterize at this stage is particularly effective. When the fire of the cauterization is just beginning, it can indeed be alarming! I have used it frequently; even in practice, I still feel a tremor, let alone those who have never experienced it before!&quot; </p>
<p>After cauterization, the pus should flow freely, and there should be no taboos, which is referred to as a ripe sore. When a sore is protruding, the needle&#39;s hole should be directed downward; however, it is essential for the practitioner to be experienced with cauterization, to understand the depths, know the acupuncture points, and distinguish between what is mature and immature. If done improperly, only fresh blood will be released; if done at the right time, yellow pus and necrotic tissue will emerge. It is incorrect to use a sharp needle for cauterization; a fine needle tip is prone to closing up, while instead, a flat and rounded tip is ideal. It is crucial that the hole is permeable, or else the ulcer&#39;s mouth may close again. One should take a root of the Achyranthes, matching the size of the ulcer mouth, slightly peel the coarse skin off, insert it into the ulcer, leaving about half an inch outside, and then apply a paste made of a handful of tender mandarin leaves and Chinese violet, ground together.<a id="trans-550p" href="#orig-550p" class="marker">[550p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Niu Xi can cause the evil blood to flow continuously, while the two medicines warm and cool to relieve pain. They should be changed as they dry, which is the full benefit of the ten. The &quot;Complete Book of Jing Yue&quot; states: According to Li Zhai, the method of moxibustion must ensure that the painful area is treated until it no longer hurts; if it is treated until it hurts more, then the poison will disperse with the fire. Otherwise, it would not only be of no benefit but could also be harmful. My humble opinion is that abscesses and sores arise from stagnation of blood and qi, caused by accumulation that fails to move. Generally, large accumulations and stagnations are the hardest to resolve. To disperse them, one cannot quickly achieve results without the power of fire; hence, moxibustion is particularly advisable. There is also the method of the Daoist Sun, known as the Immortal&#39;s moxibustion technique, which is especially refined and clever. If the poison is slightly subdued and deeply entrenched, affecting the qi&#39;s flow, moxibustion is effective; however, if the poison is fierce and urgent, posing a grave danger, then one should use the moxibustion method, which surpasses that of moxibustion alone. </p>
<p>In ancient times, there was the use of sharp stones, and &quot;The Inner Canon&quot; mentions the distinction of nine needles. Although their methods differ, the intention to eradicate disease is the same. In the case of sores and ulcers, the use of needles is paramount. When using them, although one may determine the depth of the ulcer’s opening, one must still adjust based on the thickness of the flesh: if the skin is thin and the needle is deep, it can injure the healthy flesh and worsen the ulcer; if the flesh is thick and the needle is shallow, the pus and poison will not be expelled, which will increase the pain. It&#39;s crucial to be careful when using needles! As for bone abscesses, where qi and poison accumulate, and in cases of long-standing sores that do not drain and are painless internally, it is advisable to use burning needles to open them.<a id="trans-551p" href="#orig-551p" class="marker">[551p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If treating throat ailments, one should use a three-edged needle; if there are red and swollen tumors or boils causing pain like burning, it is advisable to use a stone to draw blood in order to release the poison, leading to a reduction in severe cases and complete resolution in mild cases. When Hong&#39;s family had abdominal boils with swelling and pressure, using a needle to drain the pus resulted in recovery. In another case, a person suffered from a cyst with pus buildup and difficulty with urination, nearly facing death; immediate needling released a large amount of pus, restoring the flow of energy and resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>Generally, the method of using needles involves approaching and drawing back, aligning and obtaining results, so that what should be treated is done before it has fully developed. Nowadays, some patients, fearing needles, refuse treatment, and doctors, conforming to the patients&#39; wishes, avoid needling, leading to the formation of pus without rupture, or if rupture occurs, serious damage has already been done. Ultimately, many meet untimely ends, which is indeed lamentable! </p>
<p>The classics say: In warm and bright weather, human blood becomes abundant, and the defensive qi rises, thus blood is easily drawn, and energy flows freely; in cold and dark conditions, human blood becomes thick and stagnant while the defensive qi sinks, which is why blood vessels should be adjusted according to the season. Thus, whenever encountering cold weather or icy conditions, if one intends to use acupuncture, one should first warm themselves with clothing, or heat mugwort leaves, or use heated salt or clothing to pre-warm the area, ensuring the blood vessels are warm and gentle before needling. This way, blood can flow and energy can move, and the ailment will resolve immediately. However, if blood is cold and vessels are stagnant, hastily using needles will not release the邪毒 and may only harm healthy flesh, worsening the condition instead.<a id="trans-552p" href="#orig-552p" class="marker">[552p]</a></p></div>

In September, small sores appeared on his neck and the back of his head, which were neither painful nor itchy, resembling whitehead sores. Four days later, he experienced numbness in the head and neck, with swelling spreading outward, and heat toxins flared up; after two more days, the pain intensified, and he could not sleep at night. The physician administered Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction and later invited me for a diagnosis. I noted that due to the transformation from the rich diet, Wuxiang Lianqiao Decoction was inappropriate to use at this point; moreover, the sore had persisted for eight days, and fire therapy should come first, followed by medication. A large moxa stick about the size of two cherries was used to treat the area with strong vigor, and he began to feel pain. Next, I prescribed a remedy specific to the Taiyang Bladder meridian; the condition was reversed and needed to be treated accordingly; the pulse was tight and rapid, but strong. We had to address the underlying cause first, being mindful not to damage the harmony of heaven throughout the seasons. It was crucial to speak in terms of seasonality; hence treatment should focus on dispersing, softening, and not allowing for any cold pathogens while avoiding salty foods. Ultimately, I prescribed Huanglian Xiaodu Decoction, and he recovered.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over sixty years old, fond of wine and meat, had a back sore that oozed pus, experienced vomiting and fever, likely due to internal excess. The doctor, addressing the vomiting, added cloves to the Jiahe powder to warm the stomach and move qi. It was July, very hot, and his pulse was strong and rapid; I noted that this pulse indicated an ulcer, which is particularly worrisome. However, he was robust, so I just gave him ginseng paste mixed with bamboo juice, using a total of fifteen pounds of medicine and over a hundred stalks of bamboo. I remarked: this condition is fortunately stable; if he doesn&#39;t indulge in flavors, he must still take more. He continued to enjoy rich flavors as usual; after drinking in the summer, he sat by the water tub, and a year later a soft lump like a cake appeared near his left side. Two years later, the lump turned into an ulcer. Seeing pus and blood oozing and noting the strong and rapid pulse, along with his vomiting and reduced appetite, I again gave him ginseng paste mixed with bamboo juice, again using over a hundred stalks of bamboo, and he stabilized. Now at eighty, he is as strong as before. This illness was treated successfully twice with ginseng and bamboo juice, specifically because in old age the blood and qi are weak. Had he received the internal formula Jiexuan powder, I fear he might not have achieved such safety.<a id="trans-557p" href="#orig-557p" class="marker">[557p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure Mirror&quot; states: In the summer of the Ding-si year, I returned from military service and stayed at the border of Cao Prefecture. While on official business in the prefecture, Zhao Tongzhi informed me that my maternal uncle, Niu Jingli, was suffering from a severe illness. His head was red and swollen, and his ears were particularly affected, with pain that was unbearable. He experienced fever and chills, his jaw was tight, and he had thick, sticky mucus. He found it difficult to eat and could not rest comfortably. A doctor had performed acupuncture on the swollen area with over four or five hundred needles, but the redness and swelling did not subside, and his pain worsened. Unsure of the cause, I was asked to take a look.</p>
<p>I went to examine him and found his pulse to be floating and tense, but when pressed, it was surging and weak. This indicated that cold was enveloping the skin, blocking the meridians, preventing heat from rising, resulting in the swelling and redness. The ancient texts say: &quot;When the heavens are cold, the earth freezes and water turns to ice; when human qi is trapped within the body, the skin tightens and the pores close, sweat cannot escape, and blood and qi become strong, leading to rigid flesh.&quot; At such times, those skilled in controlling water cannot breach the ice, those adept at drilling the earth cannot penetrate the frost, and even those skilled in using needles cannot achieve the four extremities. They must wait for the warmth of spring to thaw the ice and dissolve the frost, allowing for the flow of water and the ability to penetrate the earth, just as human pulse conditions are likewise.<a id="trans-558p" href="#orig-558p" class="marker">[558p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: In the winter month, when there is closure and concealment, it is advisable to use more medicinal substances and fewer needles and stones. One should use bitter and warm medicines; warming the muscles and dispersing the cold is necessary. The so-called cold causes the pores to constrict, which can be released with bitterness and dispersed with spiciness. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the Tongli Wengjing Decoction. </p>
<p>Ephedra is bitter and warm, and it is the principal ingredient because it brings forth. Siler is spicy and warm, serving to disperse. Cimicifuga is bitter and stringy, while Kudzu is sweet and mild, resolving the muscles and inducing sweating, specifically treating the evil in the Yangming channel, thus serving as a minister. </p>
<p>When blood flows but does not circulate, it causes pain; for this, Bai Zhi, which is spicy and warm, is used; and Dang Gui, being spicy and sweet, harmonizes blood and disperses stagnation. If damp-heat causes swelling, Atractylodes is spicy and sweet, light and buoyant, strong and capable of dispelling damp-heat from the skin. </p>
<p>Ginseng and Licorice are sweet and warm, while White Peony is slightly sour and cool, balancing and augmenting Qi to support its interior. Therefore, they serve as assistants. Administer this formula while having the patient wear thin clothing over their head and a thick cover over their body, resting in a warm place to ensure the menstrual blood warms, allowing the pores to open, dispersing the cold, and promoting Yang Qi circulation. After a large sweat, the swelling will reduce by eighty to ninety percent. </p>
<p>If you take away Ephedra and Siler, and add Forsythia and Mouse Glue, all swelling and pain will be alleviated. The classic states that if sweating occurs, the sores will heal—truly wise words! However, some people follow Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s teachings, suggesting that those with sores should not sweat even if they experience body pain. What is the reason for this? I suggest that this is due to the Ying Qi not following, countering the flesh and leading to sore swellings and body pains, which are not from external influences. </p>
<p>If there is external invasion of cold evil causing pain, it is advised against inducing sweat; to sweat in such a case can lead to spasms.<a id="trans-559p" href="#orig-559p" class="marker">[559p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the winter of the year of Wuwu, I was stationed in Wucheng County with the army. There was a merchant’s father, over sixty years old, who developed a sore on his back a few days after the winter solstice. After five or seven days, the swelling reached about seven inches and was unbearable. The sore doctor said that pus had formed and could be opened, but he was afraid and did not comply. Three days later, the doctor warned that if it was not opened, it might lead to changes in the condition. Therefore, he used a burning needle to open it, the pus flowed out and the pain lessened. However, due to the delay in opening it, two days later the condition indeed changed; he felt heavy as if carrying a stone, hot as if burning, and the pain was doubled compared to before. His six pulses were deep and rapid, and pressing them felt forceful; this was a transformation due to the accumulation of heat from rich food. The evil qi was extremely hot, thus it was appropriate to treat it with cold medicine. However, the weather was severe and there were warnings against using cold, so I recalled the Inner Canon saying that one can counteract the faux conditions even if it goes against the time if it corresponds with the symptoms. I discussed with the sore doctor and urgently concocted a cooling drink with added bitter herb, weighing one tael and five qian, to be taken in one dose. It induced a bowel movement and the pain decreased by seven parts. The next day, I administered the same medicine again, and all the symptoms were eliminated.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chen Lu&#39;s mother was over seventy years old and developed a sore at the back of her head after the winter solstice, which was as large as a bowl. He ordered a sore doctor to examine it, waiting for the wound to mature before using a needle to drain the pus. Due to anger, he struck a maid, causing the sore to become indented about the size of a leeks leaf. Her complexion turned bluish-yellow and lacked luster, her limbs felt cold, she broke out in a cold sweat, and sometimes vomited. Her pulse was extremely weak, thin, and slow. This was due to her old age, the harsh winter, and the suffering from the illness, with a poor appetite. The dampness and pus had been expelled, leaving only a frail appearance. The added anger further harmed her spirit, leading to this cold transformation. </p>
<p>The illness corresponded with the season, and after discussing with the sore doctor, a swift remedy of five-spice soup was prepared, with five qian each of clove and aconite added. When the dose was completed, the sore flared up again, and she was treated according to the symptoms until she recovered. The “Inner Canon” states: “In treating illness, one must examine its underlying conditions,” meaning one should assess the appropriateness of the current situation. All pains, itching, and sores belong to heart fire, indicating their commonality. If a sore is severe and the appearance skinny, with elevated evil causing pain below, starting with heat and ending in cold, this is abnormal and should certainly be examined according to the current situation and treated accordingly.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It may be said: All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers are attributed to heart fire. During the height of summer, is it appropriate to use dried ginger and aconite? I respond that it is only natural; it cannot be otherwise. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Fine pulse and cold skin, diarrhea occurring before and after, inability to take in food, this is called the five vacuities. Moreover, the occurrence of hiccup and reversal stems from vacuity and cold in the stomach. Thus, all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers relate to heart fire, which is the fixed principle. This diagnosis shows a contradiction between internal and external conditions; treatment must be based on the evidence rather than the time, and without urgent treatment with major hot herbs, recovery cannot be achieved. Therefore, I administered the herbs, and all symptoms ceased; food intake doubled, the sores warmed, and the pus had the proper color. Yan He again used Five Spice Decoction several times, and after more than a month, he recovered. Ah! Adhering to the regular is the perspective of the many; understanding change is the concern of the wise.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a boil on his arm that did not produce pus. After undergoing treatment with moxibustion using fermented soybean cakes and about thirty doses of Tori medicine, it eventually burst and healed after more than a month. </p>
<p>Another man had a mature abscess that had not ruptured. I wanted to use a needle on it and supplement with Tori, but he did not believe in this method and instead took a toxic purging medication, which led to nausea and reduced appetite. He then realized and used a needle; after that, I added a decoction of Six Gentlemen with fragrant patchouli and angelica for four doses, followed by several doses of a modified Eight Treasure broth to close it up. Generally, for abscesses with mature pus, if one does not perform needle therapy, the pus can erode internally—mild cases are difficult to treat, severe cases are incurable. In elderly or weak individuals, or in remote areas, this becomes critical. If there is any pus, it is advisable to perform needling urgently and supplement with Tori to prevent any complications.</p>
<p>A man suffered from pain due to toxins and took cold medicine. Although the pain subsided, his appetite decreased, and the abscess did not rupture. With Six Gentlemen Decoction, his appetite improved. Then, he took Tori medicine, which led to its rupture and healing. Generally, the symptoms of sores and boils—whether due to cold, heat, deficiency, or excess—can all cause pain. For heat-related pain, cold medications are used to suppress it; for cold-related pain, warm medications are used to disperse it; if pain is caused by wind, the wind is removed; if due to dampness, moisture is expelled; if dryness causes pain, then it is moistened; if blockage causes pain, it is opened; if deficiency causes pain, it is strengthened; if excess causes pain, it is purged; if pus is stagnant and closed, it is opened; if there is necrotic tissue causing erosion, it is removed; if yin and yang are unbalanced, they are adjusted; if meridians are obstructed, they are unblocked. One must be careful not to use cold medications universally. Furthermore, blood vessels prefer warmth and dislike cold; if cold air enters the interior, the blood will coagulate and cause difficult-to-heal conditions.<a id="trans-566p" href="#orig-566p" class="marker">[566p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man of frail constitution had swelling in the elbow and wished for it to be resolved internally. However, taking cooling herbs resulted in diarrhea and reduced appetite. He was treated with Er Shen Wan and Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding nutmeg to stop the diarrhea and improve his appetite, as well as with medicines for relieving internal pressure, which also resolved the swelling. Dan Xi stated that abscesses arise from a buildup of toxins in the organs, and it&#39;s essential to first support the stomach to strengthen its vital energy, establishing a firm foundation. Then, use blood-moving herbs along with seasonal treatment to allow the toxins to emerge and be expelled. This is the essence of internal expulsion. He also mentioned that when there are swellings and sores, it is best to primarily use herbs that relieve internal pressure and disperse exterior conditions. If one desires to use Da Huang (rhubarb), it should be done cautiously to avoid recklessness. When both the internal and external sores are weak, nurturing and supplementing is the priority. Should one choose to use fragrant dispersing herbs, it may lead to excessive weakness. Generally, conditions of abscesses and swellings should not be solely treated with fire-inducing methods. The classics say that when the nourishing energy does not flow properly, it stagnates in the flesh, leading to abscesses. It also states that when the form is injured, swelling results in pain. Six excesses and seven emotions can lead to such conditions, especially considering the variances in constitution, age, and weakness, it would be inappropriate to uniformly apply cold and cool medicines. If the toxins have just begun to accumulate, but there is no pus yet and the condition is not severe, resolution is possible. It is crucial to understand the underlying cause of the illness and differentiate between weakness and strength. Should one apply cold and cooling medicines indiscriminately, it will surely lead to problems. If pus is about to form and the evil is vigorous while the energy is strong, using detoxifying agents first to kill the toxins will ensure that even if pus does form, it will not be excessively painful, and ulceration will not be severe. If one applies remedies for relieving internal pressure, it must be to enhance the condition. When pus is on the verge of forming or not yet ruptured, then one can use methods to relieve internal pressure. When pus is sufficiently formed and the condition is severe, one should use needles, and once the pus is released, all symptoms will retreat.<a id="trans-567p" href="#orig-567p" class="marker">[567p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from a carbuncle; the pus had formed but had not yet ruptured. After taking a restorative remedy, it burst, and with further treatment to strengthen the spleen, he recovered: his vital energy and blood became robust, and the pus naturally flowed out. Indeed!</p>
<p>A man had a carbuncle that ruptured but the stagnant blood did not decay. He was given ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes to vigorously replenish his qi and blood and was further treated with moxibustion on the affected area, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young boy had a carbuncle under his armpit, with the pus not clearing. His pulse was large and he was weak, disinterested in food, had difficulty sleeping, experienced spontaneous sweating, and had a dry mouth. He was treated internally with astragalus soup and moxibustion with fermented soybeans, resulting in recovery after two months. Generally, if a wound&#39;s pus ruptures and cleans, or if the wound does not close, or if there is a swelling that is not red and the flesh feels cold, or spontaneous sweating with a pale complexion, it indicates a deficiency in both qi and blood, thus supplementation is essential.</p>
<p>A man had a toxic swelling in his waist; the pus was ripe but had not ruptured. After needling, the pus leaked profusely but then caused him increased anxiety. He was treated with Shengyu Decoction for four doses, which brought him some peace; he then took Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction with added Ophiopogon and Schisandra for two months before recovery. This man later suffered from dampness, which became a chronic ailment. If pus and blood from a wound reduce significantly, even if the wound closes, it is still crucial to provide nourishing support to restore qi and blood. Otherwise, he may develop other conditions that are difficult to treat. Be cautious!</p>
<p>A woman had a carbuncle on her arm; the wound was purple and sunken with clear pus that would not contain itself. She thought the toxicity was not yet exhausted and wanted to take purgative detoxifying medicine. I indicated that in cases of ulcers, if the swelling is hard and raised with thick pus, it shows excess; if the swelling is soft and slow to resolve with thin pus, it indicates deficiency.

I treated her with the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction, adding Achyranthes and Eucommia, and moxibustion with aconite cake. After more than two months, she recovered. Generally, after pus has ruptured, if the pulse is weak and slow, it is easier to heal, as there is still stomach qi; if the pulse is thin and submerged, intermittently stopping, it indicates internal deficiency and a desire for change. If there is still pain and discomfort, it is difficult to heal when the pulse is coarse, slippery, and scattered, as it indicates a deficiency of righteous qi and excess of pathogenic qi.</p>

Then I used a remedy to stimulate the boil&#39;s maturation. Although it ruptured, it only oozed blood and water, indicating that qi and blood were still deficient and unable to produce pus. He wanted to take the Taiyi Pill, but I said this medicine merely attacks toxins and cannot consolidate. He did not believe me, and after he failed to eat for four meals, the sore turned black and concave, with relentless nausea, indicating extreme deficiency of stomach qi, leading to no treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a swelling by his side due to an abscess that did not rupture. He was given a strong tonic, and once it ruptured, he was cured; however, he later suffered from weakness and died.</p>
<p>Another man had an abscess in his lower back that appeared but did not rupture. His energy and blood could only initiate the symptoms but could not develop into pus. After several doses of a strong tonic, it ruptured, and after additional doses, the pus that came out was still clear. He then took a mixture of ginseng, astragalus, and other tonics; when the pus was scant and thick, after a few more doses, the pus gradually became thicker, and muscle tissue began to regrow. </p>
<p>For serious abscesses, energy and blood are crucial. If the condition does not progress or if it ruptures but remains unhealed, or if it does not close up and the pus is scant or clear, it indicates a deficiency of energy and blood, necessitating strong tonics, with a strict avoidance of aggressive treatments. In cases where there is an excess of pus, this also stems from a deficiency of energy and blood that cannot be restrained. If after rupture there is fever and thirst, with a strong pulse and increasing pus, this signifies a deficiency of true energy alongside an excess of pathogenic qi, and treatment becomes difficult.</p>
<p>Generally, people with sufficient energy and blood tend to have swollen, high, red abscesses that are prone to easy rupture and thick pus, making it easier for recovery. Conversely, weak individuals often do not develop or rupture abscesses easily, and their conditions are hard to treat. If one does not carefully assess and recklessly administer aggressive treatments, they will inevitably encounter disaster due to deficiency.</p>
<p>After any illness, especially in cases of scrofula and suppurative diseases, it is crucial to focus on nourishment. Otherwise, if other illnesses arise, treatment will be extremely challenging. Be cautious!<a id="trans-571p" href="#orig-571p" class="marker">[571p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from a toxic condition in his shoulder, exhibiting swelling, hardness, and pain, with worsening symptoms recurring. A treatment was prepared with three qian of powdered alum to form pills, which were taken with a broth made from seven stalks of scallions. The swelling and pain completely subsided; after taking it again, all symptoms also disappeared. Furthermore, two doses of a miraculous life-saving drink were used, which expelled fluids and resolved the issue. This secret formula is named &quot;Thousand Gold Detox Soup,&quot; prepared with powdered alum and scallion broth. Due to the difficulty in ingesting the powder, it was shaped into pills.</p>
<p>Another man had an abscess in his chest, accompanied by burning pain, agitation, fever, and thirst, with a rapid and strong pulse. During the winter season, I diagnosed this as an internal buildup of heat and toxins, needing treatment based on the symptoms at this time. I recommended using Huanglian Decoction for internal clearance. However, since it was mid-winter, he mixed in some toxic-damp dispelling medications, which caused the condition to worsen, and he continued to seek treatment. After administering the initial decoction twice and then stopping for two times, all symptoms subsided. By adding honeysuckle flower powder with Lianqiao and Sanjizhi in four doses, fluids were expelled and the problem resolved. Generally, one must identify the main symptoms and treat them accordingly. If the main issue is treated, the secondary symptoms will diminish. The choice of treatment should not be fixed to a particular time, as being tied to conventions can lead to serious illness. Moreover, the improper use of aggressive medications can harm the meridians.

I prescribed a formula of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction along with Si Wu Decoction, increasing the amounts of Chuanxiong, Angelica, Astragalus, Fritillaria, and Cinnamon to treat it. Others quoted Danxi, saying that the swelling and sores were due to internal and external stagnation, suggesting an approach that focused on resolving the excess. They further stated that before a sore has broken, if toxins attack the internal organs, no heat-inducing herbs should be used. Moreover, in this case, it was due to qi and blood stagnation, leading to using a qi-moving drink which seemed to worsen the deficiency, thus I began to trust it and sought further help.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>He wanted to take the medicine I had prescribed earlier, but I advised that those in critical condition should be treated first. Therefore, I used the Four Gentlemen Decoction with wine, stir-fried with white peony and processed ginger in four doses to gradually ease his condition. I added more angelica, then four more doses, and his stomach qi began to recover. I then removed the processed ginger and added astragalus, chuanxiong, angelica, and cinnamon in several doses; the abscess was less red and had slight pain. After more than twenty doses, pus formed, and I circumcised it, followed by giving him the Complete Nutritional Decoction. Delighted with his careful recovery, it took just over two more months for him to heal completely.</p>
<p>In cases where qi and blood are stagnant, it often results from weakened nutritive and defensive qi, which fail to circulate and disperse. How can one use qi-stagnating drinks to strengthen its deficiency? Moreover, blood and qi in each meridian vary greatly: the pericardium, bladder, and small intestine meridians have more blood and less qi, while the triple burner, gallbladder, kidneys, heart, spleen, and lungs have more qi and less blood. The previous symptoms particularly belonged to the gallbladder meridian, which is deficient in blood. Those over forty experience a daily decline in yin blood, and both pulse and symptoms indicate deficiency; the swelling and sores both signify obstruction. Thus, it is advisable to focus on relieving the exterior and dispersing the congestion, while reinforcing qi and blood with additional dispersing agents, rather than a direct attack.</p>
<p>If the swelling and pain are severe, with irritability and a forceful pulse, warming and stimulating medications should not only be avoided for swollen sores but also should not be used for ulcers. In all cases, the treatment must distinguish between the meridians, the proximity or distance from the earth, the age of the patient, their innate qi deficiency or excess, as well as the emotional influences and seasonal appropriateness of the treatment. It is common to misuse qi-stagnating and ten-points-expelling medications to treat cases of swelling, thus leading to many failures.<a id="trans-574p" href="#orig-574p" class="marker">[574p]</a></p></div>

This illustrates the principle that when blood is lost, one must replenish the qi; yin grows and yang is generated.

He was given a cooling drink which alleviated his symptoms; subsequently, he took four doses of the Tori Detoxifying Powder and recovered.</p>

<p>A man experienced pain after a rupture, with a floating and tight pulse. He took four doses of the Inner Nourishing Astragalus Decoction which stopped the pain, and after more than twenty doses, he was healed.</p>
<p>A man suffered from a toxic condition in the neck, leading to a rupture and pain. He was treated with ginseng, astragalus, rehmannia, ligusticum, and angelica, which alleviated his issues. He then received over thirty doses of the Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus and platycodon, resulting in his recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a boil, which ruptured and caused pain; his pulse was soft and weak. I suggested he was suffering from deficiency in qi and blood and needed nourishment. He doubted this and took aggressive medicinal treatments instead, which led to chills and fever, causing him to believe in my diagnosis. He then took a potent tonic and recovered. Generally, at the early stage of sores, swelling appears first, with qi and blood stagnating, resulting in pus formation, hence the pain. Once the pus is discharged, swelling decreases and muscles relax, pain will gradually lessen. If pain returns, it indicates deficiency. Danxi noted: if pain is experienced again after pus has emerged, it signifies deficiency, necessitating nourishment. There are also cases touched by foul qi that require harmonization; and those constrained by wind and cold that need warming dispersals. The Qi clan stated that in the case of sores and boils, there are various factors involving the organs and meridians, qi and blood, the internal and external, and true evil vs. deficiency. These must be discerned. For example, if the swelling is hard and accompanied by thick pus, it indicates a solid condition; if the swelling below is soft and slow with thin pus, it indicates a deficient state.<a id="trans-577p" href="#orig-577p" class="marker">[577p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A wealthy merchant had a considerable disposition and was persistently thirsty, drinking several bowls of water daily. He developed a boil on his face; though he treated it with disinfectant and healed, his pulse remained rapid, and the thirst did not cease. It was early autumn when I suggested that it was due to heart fire, predicting unavoidable issues arising from the boil and advised him to take the modified Eight Flavor Pill to supplement his kidney water. He did not believe me, and by summer, a boil appeared on the back of his foot. His pulse was rapid, and when pressed, it felt weak and without strength; this indicated a pulse of dry water and excessive fire, leading eventually to black necrosis, resulting in death.</p>
<p>A man of substantial build, lacking descendants, took aconite and other medicines that caused thirst. He developed a boil on the big toe of his left foot, which was purple and painless; his pulse was also rapid and weak, and he died. Generally, if boils occur on the back or brain, showing swelling, pain, and redness, with a pulse indicative of diminished water and excessive fire, it may still be treated; however, if the color is black or purple, indicating extreme fire resembling lack of water, it means the kidney water has been depleted, and vital essence has dried up—there is no possibility of cure.</p>
<p>Another nobleman suffered from an illness with boils and was thirsty without relief, drinking several liters of water daily. I foolishly offered the modified Eight Flavor Pill. Other physicians laughed, saying, &quot;If this medicine can quench thirst, we might as well abandon our practice.&quot; Instead, they used remedies like papaya, perilla, dried plum, ginseng, poria, and various herbs to produce body fluids, but the thirst only intensified. After several doses without effect, they had no choice but to use my suggestion, and after three days, the thirst ceased. Thus, they came to believe in it, and continued its use; not only did the thirst not return, but his blood and qi strengthened, allowing for increased appetite and vitality, even surpassing his youth. It was not merely my opinion; there is indeed a valid source for this treatment.<a id="trans-584p" href="#orig-584p" class="marker">[584p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Since my childhood, I have heard my late father say: There was once a scholar who suffered from a debilitating thirst, and all the doctors treated him with thirst-quenching medicines, yet his condition remained unstable for many years. A famous physician then diagnosed him and prescribed the adjusted Eight Flavor Pill, and within half a year, he was cured. This led to an understanding of the source of his illness. </p>
<p>Now, when doctors treat sores, they mistakenly use medicines that generate body fluids to stop the thirst. This is an error! The root of the illness originated from the depletion of kidney water, which no longer provides moisture upward, leading to a fiery heart that burns upward, causing thirst from boiling. Taking the Eight Flavor Pill alleviates the heart fire and replenishes the kidney water, thus quenching the thirst. </p>
<p>Furthermore, analyzing the properties of the medicine, it is said that within the Five Flavors, the north flavor is the most effective. This single ingredient can uniquely nourish kidney water and harmonize heart fire, yielding significant results. Our family has this formula stored away and through personal use, it has proven effective, hence I dare to lay it out in detail, so that those who suffer from thirst may trust its efficacy, focus on taking the medicine to achieve results, and not be misled by incompetent doctors, hopefully broadening the intent of those before us. </p>

Dan Xi said: “Ulceration and thirst are due to both qi and blood deficiency, especially with a floating and weak pulse.” I prescribed three qian each of Ren Shen and Huangqi, and two qian each of Gui Zhi, Bai Zhu, and Shu Di. After several doses, his thirst diminished; I then added Huangqi to Ba Zhen Tang for several doses, which helped his pulse stabilize and he recovered.</p>
<p>In treating thirst related to sores or ulcers, I do not concern myself with swelling and suppuration, only with rapid pulse, fever, and thirst, thereby using Zhuye Huangqi Decoction. If the pulse is not rapid and there is no fever, or if the pulse is rapid but weak and the person feels thirsty or dry in the mouth, I use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. If the pulse is rapid but the patient also has constipation, I administer a cooling drink. For a large, strong pulse with weakness on palpation and thirst, I use modified Bawei Wan, which is effective. For treating dry mouth and a yellow tongue, where drinking causes no relief, this pill is particularly marvelous.<a id="trans-586p" href="#orig-586p" class="marker">[586p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man experienced a skin itch after an outbreak, which I attributed to a deficiency in qi and blood that couldn’t nourish the pores. I treated him with tonics. He did not believe and instead took remedies for wind, resulting in no improvement. Generally, when sores first appear with a weak pulse and itchiness, the focus should be on reducing fire and cooling the blood. After the onset, if the pulse remains weak, the focus should be on replenishing blood and qi. Resorting to wind medications can lead to calamity.</p>
<p>A scholar suffered from many bone ulcers in his leg for over a year, expelling some necrotic bone. He felt cold before noon and had fever in the afternoon, with dry mouth and phlegm, frequent urination. I believed this to be due to a deficiency in the three yin of the foot. I administered a formula to tonify middle qi in the morning and the Eight Ingredients Pill with added Astragalus, Angelica, and Schisandra in the evening, giving over thirty doses. I also applied external medications, and he gradually improved; he particularly liked the restorative formulas.</p>

Continuing with the previous medications, all symptoms resolved, and the ulcer closed.</p>
<p>A woman over thirty, previously weak, gradually had swelling on the back of her left hand. After two years, it ulcerated with clear pus, the swelling darkened and extended to her arm. She suffered from internal heat with afternoon fevers, spontaneous and night sweats, and menstruation occurring every two months. This indicated a deficiency in liver and spleen qi and blood. I administered a formula to replenish the spleen in the morning and a soothing formula in the evening, frequently applying a scallion poultice to the swollen area. After two months, symptoms gradually improved, and necrotic bone was expelled from the ulcer.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had a painful carbuncle on her left hand, experiencing itching, chills, fever, and nausea, with her left side becoming numb, and her pulse was rapid but intermittent. She reported that generally, sores should not be painless, and excessive pain is not advisable; if one feels anxious or distressed, treatment should not be given. Now she had itching, which was especially troubling; two doses of a life-rescue pill had no effect. Afterward, detoxifying agents were used, and the itching began to dissipate, but swelling and pain emerged. I said: Although the situation seems dire, the fact that she experienced pain is fortunate; however, the toxic energy had nowhere to escape, so I used acupuncture, and all symptoms quickly retreated. Then another detoxifying agent was used, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Su Xiang was robust but had a serious carbuncle on his back, with red streaks reaching his wrist, experiencing chills and fever, indicative of a surface condition. After taking a dose of the life-rescue pill, the red streaks quickly disappeared. Another harmonizing remedy was administered, significantly alleviating the symptoms. However, he then took a detoxifying herb, which caused thirst and fever, and the red streaks reemerged. His pulse was floating, large, and weak; this signaled an injury to his qi and blood, which was then treated with a restorative potion, and he recovered. It appears that after taking the life-rescue pill, the pathogenic energy of the sore had dispersed, yet taking the detoxifying agent again was unnecessary, deviating from the principles in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot;</p>
<p>A scholar had a carbuncle and his original qi was weak. I supplemented his qi and blood, leading to pus discharge and recovery. Later, due to overexertion, the scar began to itch, and he took a dose of detoxifying powder which resulted in a locked jaw and rigid tongue, with involuntary spasms in his hands and feet, accompanied by an uncontrollable flow of saliva. This was due to further injury to his qi and blood, leading to spasms. I prescribed a comprehensive restorative formula with an added amount of aconite, which he took, and he revived.<a id="trans-589p" href="#orig-589p" class="marker">[589p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from a carbuncle and took a lethal potion, leading to continuous sweating. The sore did not hurt, the fever persisted, and he experienced difficulty with urination. The excessive sweating depleted yang energy and harmed the vital energy. I prescribed two formulas containing ginseng, astragalus, angelica, atractylodes, peony,防风 (notable herb), and five-flavored herbs, after which all symptoms retreated, but there was still concern about the difficulty urinating. I said: &quot;The reason for the difficulty is the excessive sweating; once the sweating stops, yang energy will recover and urination will resume.&quot; I continued with the previous herbs, removed 防风, added ophiopogon, and doubled the dosage of scutellaria and angelica. After four doses, urination became easier, and the sore healed.</p>
<p>My cousin, who lives in wealth, had a purple carbuncle on his right little finger, which some called a small sore. After puncturing it to draw blood and applying a cool medicine, his palm and finger swelled three to four times, darkened, and did not hurt. His mind became dulled, and he was restless, indicating a drain of vital energy and an accumulation of evil qi. I first gave him one dose of lethal dan and two doses of a life-saving drink, which helped slightly. Later, I punctured his hand all over, drawing enough fresh blood to fill a bowl, but the swelling extended to his arm and wrist, appearing as large as a gourd, with the fingers swelling several times, making it unable to drain. I used a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, and frequently moxibustion on the hand, which gradually reduced the swelling. However, he had difficulty with bowel movements and often experienced a loss of gas, indicating that the vital energy was sinking. To restore it, I added dried succory, nutmeg, evodia, and five-flavored herbs to the formula to solidify his stool. I also prescribed an infusion of ginseng (five qian), ophiopogon (three qian), and five-flavored herbs (two qian) as a substitute for tea. Additionally, I applied over fifty doses of tonifying medicine, and he gradually recovered. If this condition had initially not been treated with detoxifying agents, and subsequently not with strong tonics, it would have been difficult for him to survive!<a id="trans-590p" href="#orig-590p" class="marker">[590p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A twenty-year-old person has had a lip sore for four days, with a purple vein leading from the sore to the mouth, nearing the throat. I said: This is a case of true Qi being deficient while evil Qi is strong. If the purple vein reaches the throat, it will be difficult to treat! It is necessary to needle the purple vein and the sore to draw out bad blood to release its poison. Additionally, I used an antidote, but both the head and face became swollen, and the patient sought treatment urgently. I said: My previous words were not mistaken! Upon examining the pulse, it was flood-like and rapid, yet when pressed, felt faint; the mouth was swollen and the needle could not penetrate. I used a stone to scrape the face and lip, drawing out a bowl&#39;s worth of black blood. Although the condition slightly improved, after a bit of broth, the patient ultimately did not recover.</p>
<p>The prefect Zhang Hengshan had a sore on the left toe that was unbearably painful. In a hurry, he applied thirty or so clove garlic moxibustion, and he could walk. Wanting a quick recovery, he applied cool medicines, which resulted in blood coagulating and flesh dying, with the toxic air becoming more intense. After moxibusting a hundred times and taking a life-saving drink, purple blood was expelled, and the poison was finally relieved. The bottom of his foot began to fester, with substantial decayed tendons and rotten flesh. He was about to heal when he mistakenly used a flesh-regenerating medicine, which exacerbated the poison, depleting his vital energy and preventing recovery. I treated him with a purging medicine because I was pleased with his constitution, and after over three months in a guest place, he finally healed. Generally, sores on the limbs can benefit from moxibustion methods that have rejuvenating effects. If cool medicines are used, they constrict the pores, block the pathways, and increase the evil Qi, often leading to failure to recover. If the poison is not fully resolved and flesh-regenerating medicines are abruptly used, it can lightly worsen the ulcer or, in severe cases, lead to life-threatening situations.<a id="trans-591p" href="#orig-591p" class="marker">[591p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>An elderly woman suffered from severe pain in her big toe due to a boil and requested cauterization, but the person refused and only took a powdered remedy for detoxification, which led to a deficiency in genuine qi and an increase in evil qi, ultimately resulting in her demise. Though the powdered remedy can disperse the poison from superficial sores, ailments affect both the exterior and interior, vary in severity, and have different characteristics of excess and deficiency. Thus, it is inappropriate to use one treatment universally. Furthermore, at the extreme depths, medicinal power is hard to reach, and relying solely on medicine is often inadequate; cauterization would be a better approach. Therefore, for boils in the lower body, they should be treated with garlic-based cauterization: if painful, cauterize to the point of no pain; if not painful, cauterize until pain arises. If cauterization follows and there is still no pain, one should use bright cauterization and needle the areas around the boil to remove stagnant blood, placing a life-saving pill inside the boil and applying an herbal plaster. If the needle causes no pain or there’s no blood, one should heat the needle until red and repeatedly apply it to the affected area, using the degree of pain as the measure. If there is no pain and one sees a blackness like firelight, this indicates that toxic qi has entered the organs, which is untreatable. If the boil is on the hands or feet, with red threads indicating an attack on the heart and abdomen, one should prick until the stagnant blood is removed, and it’s advisable to take a remedy for detoxification. If the thread approaches the heart or abdomen, one should puncture the boil head to release the foul fluid, applying an herbal plaster afterwards. If there is numbness, one should take a life-saving pill. If the jaws are tightly clenched or there are throat ailments, one should hold one or two pills in the mouth. Sudden deaths in people are often due to boil toxins; one should examine the entire body with a lamp, and if any small sores are found, they should be promptly cauterized, followed by the intake of detoxification medicine or life-saving pills upon recovery. If a person sweats into the flesh and subsequently consumes food, they may develop boils; caution is necessary!<a id="trans-593p" href="#orig-593p" class="marker">[593p]</a></p></div>

A needle was inserted four to five tenths of an inch deep; it was as hard as bone and made a sound. Subsequently, toad venom strips were applied for three days, yet it did not decompose. This is a case of a stubborn and firm mass; the medicinal power was insufficient, so a three-ranked needle was used, inserted for seven days, and covered with a paper plaster. On the eleventh day, a chunk of the boil root came out, about the size of a finger. A nourishing ointment made of meat and jade red balm was gradually applied. Initially, a detoxifying powder with two qian of honeysuckle and five fen of angelica was taken. After the boil was expelled, a mixture of the Eight Treasures Decoction with one qian each of Trichosanthes fruit, Ophiopogon, Astragalus, and dried tangerine peel was used for over a month to adjust the body.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman nearing her forties had a discordant marriage, troubled by various worries that lingered in her heart. It was the height of summer, while the year suffered great famine. She developed a carbuncle on her cheek, which only became visible six days later. By that time, the poison had already spread; her head, eyes, lips, and neck were all swollen, and her complexion was purple-red. I said: &quot;The flesh is not swollen due to a wound; the poison is turning yellow; this is a case of neglect.&quot; The woman lamented, shedding tears, saying: &quot;My whole family is doomed!&quot; I asked: &quot;Why is that?&quot; She replied: &quot;My husband is a worthless man. I have one daughter and two sons, all of whom are unmarried. If I were to die, the children would be left to him; they would surely become drifters in the future. Thus, if the woman lives, the family survives; if she dies, the family perishes; it&#39;s the natural order of things.&quot; Hearing this, I pondered deeply and wondered how she could survive. I could not bear to abandon her. Moreover, the condition of her wound was severe and beyond the power of medicine to heal.<a id="trans-596p" href="#orig-596p" class="marker">[596p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is my contemplation that one should first hire a poor person, feed them until satisfied, and then give them several cups of hot wine. Following this, needles should be used to prick over ten swollen areas, allowing them to suck out several bowls of bad blood. The area should then be washed with warm broth, and a concentrated paste made from toad venom should be applied. Golden powder should be sprinkled around, twice a day, morning and evening. Internally, one should use herbal formulas to protect the heart, along with medicated pills and calming remedies to reduce fire, transform phlegm, and relieve stagnation, in hopes of ensuring no transformation occurs.</p>
<p>After the blood is sucked out, the remaining swelling slightly decreases. On the sixth day, due to a quarrel between the couple, the swelling returns, worse than before. Needles should again be used to prick about ten areas of the most pronounced swelling, allowing three to four bowls of blood to be drawn. Small adhesive strips should cover the needle holes. The remaining swelling should still be treated.</p>
<p>The individual has lost a lot of blood, so they must be nourished. A restorative formula with ginseng should be supplemented with fragrant cyperus and fritillaria. After several days, the needle holes slowly produce pus, and the remaining swelling gradually diminishes. The original wound site becomes high and swollen again. The process of inserting toad venom should continue, and it too gradually becomes necrotic. Externally, promote healing of the wound and internally take remedies to relieve stagnation, harmonize the middle, nourish blood, and strengthen the spleen. Regulating these for a hundred days should eventually lead to recovery. </p>
<p>If this condition were to be assessed based on the appearance and color of the wounds, there would be virtually no hope for survival. However, through determined effort, life was sustained. Subsequently, the couple had two sons and one daughter, who married in succession. Their husband also held fast till the end, and it is said that they have now lived for over sixty years.<a id="trans-597p" href="#orig-597p" class="marker">[597p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, twenty-two years old, had a sore on her right ear that had protruded forward by an inch for two days. She asked me to examine it. The sore was the size of a mung bean, with a grayish depressed center; this was a case of abscess caused by toxins affecting the lung meridian. Upon further examination, I found that the base was soft and lacking consolidation, indicating a hidden condition of yin deficiency. Before I could perform acupuncture, her uncle asked what was wrong. I told him directly that it was an abscess. He laughed coldly and did not believe me. Consequently, I declined to use medicine, leaving it to their belief. They then sought another physician, who examined her and said it was a wind-heat skin lump, merely a minor ailment. The family then reported that another doctor had previously said it was an abscess, to which the physician nodded and laughed, saying, &quot;This is truly nonsense!&quot; The family was pleased. In the end, the patient received a prescription for a wind-dispelling powder, which completely absorbed the toxic qi, resulting in her sudden confusion, breathlessness, and ultimately death.<a id="trans-598p" href="#orig-598p" class="marker">[598p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young woman had a sore under her cheekbone for a year, which caused itching. I wanted to treat it with needles, but her family did not believe me. After I left, she applied moxibustion herself. The next day, the area around the sore began to swell gradually, and the sore became soft and depressed. After three more days, her face and head were extremely swollen, so she asked me to treat it again. I observed that the original sore had developed a black scab where the moxibustion was applied, and although it was dry and depressed, there was no pus. This indicated that the toxic energy had sunk in, and the flesh was already dead. Additionally, her face was puffy, shiny, and hot, looking distressed. This was a clear sign of weakened vital energy and strong pathogenic energy; even if treated, it would be ineffective, and she would inevitably die. Her family then regretted it. After half a month, she indeed passed away.</p>
<p>A man had swelling and pain in his palate for over a month, and treatment with herbs to dispel wind and clear heat proved ineffective. After another two months, the sore broke open, bleeding a watery fluid, and over a hundred days, over thirty small bones emerged. I applied a nourishing decoction and a wound healing powder, and after more than two months, the sore began to close. However, there remained a small opening, the size of a hairpin, connecting to his nasal passage, which made it difficult for the sore to fully heal, leading to a situation where he did not recover completely.<a id="trans-599p" href="#orig-599p" class="marker">[599p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a swelling on his left hip for over a year, which eventually developed into a rotten patch that oozed thin pus. After six months, a bone-like growth appeared, resembling an eagle&#39;s hip bone and measuring about four inches long. He took herbs to nourish the blood and strengthen the spleen internally, and applied Yuhong ointment externally. After a little over a month, it began to heal.</p>
<p>Another man experienced swelling and pain in the front of his lower leg for two years, with various medicines proving ineffective; this was a case of multiple bone sores. Eventually, a piece of bone broke through, and the flesh became rotten, while his vital energy weakened. He was treated with a tonic soup of Shiquan Dabu, adding Shan Zhuyu, Niuxi, and Mu Guo, but after over two months, it showed no signs of healing. Each day, he used a spirit lamp to apply heat, which helped another piece of decayed bone break through, revealing dozens of small holes. He powdered the two pieces of bone over a red-hot fire and mixed it into a wound-healing medicine to aid in healing. When asked why bone was used, the answer was that the bone originally held the essence of vital energy and blood, which is why it was used to restore the vital energy. This principle aligns with the natural order.</p>
<p>A woman had a swelling at the root of her upper left tooth resembling a grain of millet, hard as stone and painless; this was a multiple bone sore, and medication was ineffective. After three years, it began to hurt, oozing foul pus, and later, numerous bone fragments emerged, resembling a small tortoise; the swelling persisted. After some time, two small bones emerged, marked by a dry and rugged appearance, and the swelling finally began to subside. She was treated with Si Jun Zi Tang with added Sheng Ma and Chen Pi, and rinsed her mouth with a licorice decoction, applying a wound-healing powder three times until it healed.<a id="trans-600p" href="#orig-600p" class="marker">[600p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Meaningful Grass&quot; states: Huang Hongxuan suddenly developed a painful abscess on his arm, swollen and without a head, causing extreme discomfort that was unbearable. All external doctors agreed it was caused by heat poison. Upon reflection, he was usually indifferent, clear-minded, and calm, having no factors contributing to heat and poison, thus he didn&#39;t know the origin of his affliction. I urged Mr. Zun to deliberate with Changshan on the illness, suggesting we set aside our wine and food to focus on remedying it. Chang replied: &quot;Regarding this condition, let&#39;s first offer congratulations, then I will discuss it.&quot; </p>
<p>Every sore and ulcer has its cause: external causes include the toxic influences of improper weather and the infectious filth of daily rituals; internal causes involve the heat poison from rich wines and heavy flavors, or the fiery poison born from suppressed anger. The treatment of fire poison and all other poisons essentially originates from two extremes. Fire and vital energy cannot coexist; when cooled by coldness, vital energy dissipates. Hongxuan showed no signs of these causes, and thus failed to recognize it as leftover fetal poison. </p>
<p>Human beings inherit the vital energy of heaven and earth, differing in purity and turbidity; those possessing pure and refined essence can expect boundless fortune and longevity. However, having been conceived by parents, one&#39;s body inevitably carries a mix of desires and passions; what one relies on is the expulsion of that latent desire through eruptions like pox, thereby returning to the constancy of pure essence. Like mining gold, one must undergo the refining process in a red furnace, where impurities are separated from the pure shine.<a id="trans-601p" href="#orig-601p" class="marker">[601p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I once observed the eyes of those who had developed smallpox using this method. After seven or eight days, when their eyes were opened, those with clear distinctions between black and white possessed pure essence, while those with red veins and a red membrane were mixed essence. As for those with blurry pupils and lacking the spirit&#39;s light, they were entirely devoid of essence. Hong Xuan had too many pox marks in his youth, which prevented his vital energy from being fully replenished. While the internal fire poison had been eliminated, stagnation within his body still remained; thus, the pox sores inevitably erupted in the areas of his hands and feet, particularly at the Qiuchu points, as scattered minor poisons had no place to reside and sought refuge in hard-to-reach areas. Today’s sores and abscesses appeared exactly at the Qiuchu acupoint, raising no doubt about the nature of the pox poison. The poison lurking under the elbows and armpits was harmless, but the pure body contained some impurities, which also constitute fine dust in a precious mirror, a slight blemish on a white jade. The day when the supreme harmony’s vital energy fills the entire body, it aims to expel all remnants from fifteen years past as pus and blood. Others may see this as poison, but I had long foreseen it as an opportunity for recovery. Is it plausible that one can be free-flowing in limbs yet not develop in vital matters? The treatment involves externally applying purslane gel for rapid breakdown, and internally using the Baoyuan Decoction to expel everything, while still employing the prescribed medication for pox and abscesses, ensuring prompt recovery, unlike the prolonged issues of sore poisons. However, if one fails to recognize the symptoms and indiscriminately administers cooling and poison-expelling medications, it simply amplifies the troubles. Who claims that minor external ailments can be dealt with without someone who understands how to negotiate effectively? If treated as prescribed, there will be a significant outflow of pus and water, and naturally, there is no need for wound healing and flesh growing treatments for spontaneous recovery.<a id="trans-602p" href="#orig-602p" class="marker">[602p]</a></p></div>
