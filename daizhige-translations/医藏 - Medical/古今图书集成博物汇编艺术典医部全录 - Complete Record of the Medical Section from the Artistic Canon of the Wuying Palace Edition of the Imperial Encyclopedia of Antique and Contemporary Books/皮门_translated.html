<p><strong>Dermatology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Discussion on the Genuine Words of Gold and Solidarity</strong></p>
<p>In the West, the color is white, corresponding to the lungs, which open at the nose and store essence in the lungs. Therefore, when illness occurs in the shoulders, its taste is pungent, its nature is metal, it relates to horses, its grain is rice, and it corresponds to the four seasons, appearing as the Tai Bai star; thus, it is known that the illness is in the skin and fur. Its sound is &quot;shang,&quot; its number is nine, its smell is fishy.<br><em>[Note: The lungs govern the skin and fur, hence illness manifests in them.]</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Theory of the Six Sections and Organs</strong></p>
<p>The lung is the root of qi and the place where the soul resides. Its brilliance is in the fur, its fullness is in the skin, being the Tai Yin among the Yang, connecting with the autumn qi.<br><em>[Note: The lung governs qi and stores the soul, hence it is the root of qi and the place of the soul. The lung governs skin and fur, thus its brilliance is in the fur and fullness in the skin. The organs reside high and belong to Yin, thus it is the Tai Yin among the Yang, connecting with the autumn qi, which rules the lung.]</em></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The lung&#39;s connection is with the skin, its brilliance is in the fur, and it governs the heart. Excessive consumption of bitter tastes leads to withered skin and fallen fur.<br><em>[Note: The lung governs qi, and qi governs the exterior, hence its connection to the skin. The &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states: when the pulse at the cun (inch) is slow and delayed, the Yang qi is abundant. Its sound is &quot;shang,&quot; the hair grows long, and hair adheres to the skin; with abundant qi, the fur flourishes. Excessive consumption of bitter is due to an excess of the fire flavor, which harms the lungs, resulting in withered skin and fallen fur.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The end of the Taiyin meridian indicates abdominal distension, inability to breathe, propensity to belch and vomit. If there is vomiting, there is a reversal of qi, which causes the face to turn red. If qi does not reverse, there will be blockage in the upper and lower parts, and without passage, the face will turn black, with the skin and hair becoming scorched, leading to a fatal outcome. </p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The foot Taiyin pulse enters the abdomen and is associated with the spleen, thus causing abdominal distension. The hand Taiyin pulse rises to the diaphragm, is related to the lungs, and governs respiration, hence the inability to breathe. When there is fullness, ascent and descent are difficult; when there is an inability to breathe, it indicates stagnation of qi. Belching leads to qi rising upwards, which causes a red face; if qi does not reverse, there is internal blockage, leading to a lack of passage between the upper and lower parts. When the spleen qi is deficient, it cannot control fluids, which is why the face turns black. When lung qi is deficient, the body does not function properly, resulting in dryness of skin and hair.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The flow of pulse qi travels through the meridians, and the essence of meridian qi returns to the lungs, with the lungs connecting to all hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin and hair.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Pulse qi consists of the essence of food and water that flows through the meridians. It refers to the qi of the food entering the stomach, first activating the qi in the vessels. The essence of the hundred vessels ultimately returns to the main meridian, and since the essence of the meridian returns to the lungs, all vessel qi converges in the lungs. The lungs connect with the skin and hair, thus distributing essence to them as well.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Bi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What is the cause of the Bi syndrome? Qi Bo replied: It arises from the mingling of the three qi: wind, cold, and damp, which combine to become Bi. When this occurs in autumn, it manifests as skin Bi. Therefore, when bone Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the kidneys; when muscle Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the liver; when pulse Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the heart; when flesh Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the spleen; when skin Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the lungs. Thus, the so-called Bi in each case arises from a strong external influence of wind, cold, and damp at that time. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Bi means blockage, and the malevolent factors block and cause pain. The description indicates that the three qi of wind, cold, and damp arrive mixed, creating Bi. The skin, flesh, muscles, and bones are related to the five organs, and the qi of the five organs corresponds externally to the four seasons. The initial manifestation occurs externally as a form, which then injures the internal five qi; the combination of external and internal influences leads to the blockage within. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Some cases of Bi lead to death, some cause prolonged pain, and some are easily resolved; what are the reasons for this? Qi Bo said: Those that invade the organs lead to death; those that linger between muscle and bone cause prolonged pain; those that remain within the skin are easily resolved. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the wind, cold, and damp penetrate the points, and the organ qi is strong, then the malevolent factor does not affect the organs. When the spirit and qi deplete, the Bi gathers in the organs and causes death. If it lingers between muscle and bone without affecting the organs, it causes prolonged pain. If it remains within the skin, it disperses easily with the qi.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If it affects the pulse, then it internally connects to the five organs. Moreover, if the yin energy does not accumulate, the pathogenic factors directly enter the organs, resulting in incurable death. The Emperor said: Good. Why do blockages sometimes cause pain, sometimes not, sometimes numbness, sometimes cold or heat, sometimes dryness or dampness? Qi Bo replied: Pain occurs because of excessive cold; thus, there is pain from the presence of cold. Those that do not feel pain or numbness are due to long-term illness infiltrating deeply, causing the regulation of vital substances to be obstructed and the meridians to be intermittently blocked, hence the lack of flow. The skin does not receive nourishment, resulting in numbness.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>When a邪病 persists for a long time, the pathways of nourishment and defense become injured and flow weakly. If the邪 enters deeply, it does not cause blockage in the physical body but results in a temporary looseness in the meridians, hence there is no pain. When the pathways of nourishment and defense are weak, they cannot nourish the skin, leading to insensitivity.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: In the case of bi syndrome, why is there no pain? Qibo replied: When bi affects the bones, it feels heavy; when it affects the vessels, the blood stagnates and does not flow; when it affects the tendons, they cannot bend or extend; when it affects the flesh, there is insensitivity; when it affects the skin, it feels cold. Therefore, possessing these five conditions results in no pain.</p>
<p>Note: Bones have bone qi, vessels have vessel qi, tendons have tendon qi, flesh has flesh qi, and skin has skin qi, all of which correspond to the qi of the five organs and integrate with the physical body. If the body is affected but its qi is not injured, one only observes the heaviness of bone bi, the stagnation of blood in vessel bi, the inability to bend or extend in tendon bi, the insensitivity of flesh bi, and the coldness of skin bi. Hence, possessing these five physical symptoms results in no pain.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>On the Skin and Its Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: I have heard that the skin has divisions, the vessels have pathways, the tendons have connections, and the bones have measurements, with each giving rise to different diseases. Please differentiate their divisions, left and right, up and down, the yin and yang locations, and the beginning and end of the diseases. I wish to know this principle.</p>
<p>Qibo replied: To understand the skin, we should regard the meridians as the framework; all meridians are like this. The yangming of the yang is called &quot;Hɑi Fei,&quot; following the same principle up and down. Looking at its section, if there are superficial connections, they all belong to the yangming connections. If the color is mostly blue, it indicates pain; if black, it indicates blockage; if yellow or red, it indicates heat; if white, it indicates cold; if all five colors are present, it indicates both cold and heat. If the connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. The yang governs the outer, while the yin governs the inner.</p>
<p>The shaoyang of the yang is called &quot;Shu Chi,&quot; which also follows the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections in this section, they all belong to the shaoyang connections. If the connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians; thus, those in the yang govern the inner, while those in the yin govern the outer, allowing for infiltration into the inner; all meridians follow this principle. </p>
<p>The taiyang of the yang is called &quot;Guan Shu,&quot; which again follows the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections here, they all belong to the taiyang connections. When connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. The shaoyin of the yin is called &quot;Shu Ru,&quot; also following the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections in this section, they all belong to the shaoyin connections. When connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. </p>
<p>Their entry into the meridians is through the yang section entering into the meridian; their exit is from the yin interior into the bones. The heart governs the yin, known as &quot;Hɑi Jian,&quot; which follows the same principle up and down.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>In examining the parts, those with floating collaterals are all connected to the heart&#39;s collaterals. When the collaterals are abundant, they lead pathogens into the meridians. The yin of the Taiyin is called Guan Zhe, and the same principles apply both above and below. Observing its parts, those with floating collaterals are all associated with the Taiyin&#39;s collaterals. When the collaterals are abundant, they lead pathogens into the meridians. All twelve meridians are connected to the skin. Thus, the onset of all diseases must begin with the skin and hair; when pathogens penetrate, the pores open, and when opened, they allow pathogens to enter the collaterals, lingering and not departing, transferring into the meridians and lingering there, passing into the organs and accumulating in the intestines and stomach.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>When邪 (pathogenic factors) first enters the skin, it causes a sudden rise of fine hairs and opens the pores; when it enters the vessels, the channels become engorged and discolored; when it invades the meridians, one feels weakness and descends into discomfort; if it lingers between muscles and bones, excessive cold causes muscle cramps and bone pain, while excessive heat leads to relaxation of the muscles and depletion of the bones, resulting in flesh being broken down and hair becoming brittle and falling out. The Emperor said: &quot;In your discussion of the twelve divisions of the skin, how do these lead to illness?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The skin is part of the channels; when邪 enters the skin, it opens the pores, allowing邪 to invade the vessels. When the vessels are full, it flows into the meridians, and when the meridians are full, it settles into the organs. Therefore, the skin divides into sections; if邪 does not enter, it can lead to major illness.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;Good.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: This section discusses the twelve meridian channels, explaining how illness begins at the skin, enters the vessels, and proceeds through the channels to affect the organs. If it does not enter the vessels, it lingers in the muscles and bones, leading to cramps and pain.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Seasonal Pathologies</h3>
<p>When there is an excess of Lesser Yin, the illness manifests as skin ailments, itching, and rashes. When there is a deficiency, it presents as lung-related issues. If it is slippery, it indicates lung wind hernia; if it is retentive, it suggests accumulation, urination, and blood issues.<br>(Note: The lungs govern the skin, and the networks combine with essence between the skin, which is why skin ailments and lung issues are linked to Lesser Yin. Hernias indicate an issue in Qi, while blood issues pertain to blood. The autumnal climate affects the skin; autumn marks the beginning of the gathering of atmospheric energy, leading to closed pores and tense skin.)</p>
<h3>Discussion on Governance Principles</h3>
<p>The Greater Yang governs the heavens; cold air descends, heart Qi ascends, and fire becomes evident, soil becomes moist, and water becomes abundant. As the cold guest arrives, the heavy Yin transforms into moisture; energies change substances. When water fills the interior, leading to saturation and inability to eat, skin and muscle become afflicted, and tendons and vessels are impeded. In severe cases, this results in swellings and carbuncles on the back.<br>(Note: When Greater Yang governs the heavens, the Lesser Yin&#39;s humid earth collects in springs, thus the soil becomes moist. &quot;Accumulation&quot; refers to storage; the affliction of skin and flesh arises from water and dampness. The carbuncles on the back indicate lesions that develop there.)<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<h3>The True Discussion of the Most Important</h3>
<p>In the year when the Lesser Yin is in the spring, if the heat overcomes, then flames will rise over rivers and marshes, and the shadow will appear bright. The people suffer from a constant rumbling in the abdomen, the energy surges up to the chest, causing wheezing and inability to stand for long. There are chills and fevers, skin pain, closed eyes, and toothaches, swelling, and chills accompanied by fever resembling malaria. There is pain in the lower abdomen, an enlarged belly, and insects do not hide. </p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yin in spring refers to the year of the Rabbit and the Rooster. The fire of the Lesser Yin generates in the water, hence the flames rise over rivers and marshes. The Lesser Yin indicates shadow and fundamentally fire, thus the shadow appears bright. The constant rumbling in the abdomen signifies the bustling fire energy. The energy surging up to the chest indicates the fiery energy rising. Wheezing and inability to stand for long, along with chills and skin pain, result from the fire overpowering the lungs. Closed eyes signify extreme heat with Yin deficiency, causing aversion to sunlight. Toothaches and swelling occur due to heat overwhelming the Yang Ming. Fevers resembling malaria are due to the illness of the foundational energy of the Lesser Yin. Heat in the lower region causes pain in the lower abdomen, and heat in the middle region causes stomach distension.)</p>
<p>The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when overwhelmed by heat, the oppressive heat arrives, and the fire carries out its governance. The people suffer from vexing heat in the chest, dry throat, fullness on the right side of the abdomen, skin pain, chills, and cough with wheezing.</p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yin governing the heavens refers to the year of the Rat and the Horse. The fire of the Lesser Yin ignites in the depths, thus causing oppressive heat.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>In the Lesser Yin and Greater Yang, there is Yang within Yin and Yin within Yang. Yin and Yang follow each other, and their essence transforms; hence, when fire becomes exceedingly hot, great rain arrives; when water becomes extremely cold, it activates fire’s fierceness. The people suffer from heat and dryness in the chest, fullness on the right side, skin pain, the lungs feeling hot while bodily fluids fail to generate.</p>
<p>In the Lesser Yang, when Fire overpowers, warmth spreads. If metal governance is unbalanced, the people suffer from headaches, fever, chills, and malaria, skin pain from heat, complexion turning yellow and red, evolving into water disturbances, swelling in the body and face, fullness in the abdomen, difficult breathing, diarrhea with red and white discharge, sores, coughing up blood, irritability, and heat in the chest, and in severe cases, nosebleeds, with the illness originating in the lungs. If the heavenly treasury ends, it leads to death without treatment.</p>
<p>Note: The Lesser Yang commands the heavens, particularly in the years of the Tiger and Monkey. The domination of fire leads to the imbalance of metal governance. The fire in the Lesser Yang, prevailing in the heavens, causes summer heat, hence the people suffer from headaches, chills, malaria, skin heat, and color change. The water transmit back as it challenges the overflow of metal and water, resulting in swelling from water disease, leading to difficult breathing, with lung energy reversing, preventing rest. Discharges of red and white, sores, blood in the spittle, illustrate the heat&#39;s severity. Severe nosebleeds indicating involvement of the lungs result from excessive fire overpowering metal; therefore, the original illness lies in the lungs.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The Heavenly Treasury refers to the lungs, where the pulse can be felt three inches under the armpit; if the lung qi is exhausted, then death cannot be treated. The victory of the sun brings frost and is arriving; when water freezes at the wrong time, the feathers transform later. Hemorrhoids and malaria arise, cold-induced collapse enters the stomach leading to internal heart pain; ulcers emerge in the yin, causing obstruction and mutual pulling of the yin thighs, muscles and tendons become tense, blood vessels coagulate and weep, the veins are filled and the color changes, sometimes leading to blood leakage, the skin may be swollen and filled, the abdomen feels full and appetite decreases. </p>
<p>(Note: The cold water qi of the sun prevails, hence the frost and arrival. When water freezes at the wrong time, it indicates the excess qi from a year and a half ago, thus the transformation of insects occurs later. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that those suffering from hemorrhoids and malaria are afflicted by the sun&#39;s cold and heat. When collapse enters the stomach, it is because water invades the earth. The stomach connects to the heart, leading to heart pain. Ulcers emerging in the yin cause obstruction and mutual pulling of the yin thighs. The feet concerned with the sun dominate the muscles, thus the tension in muscles and tendons. Blood vessels weep and change color due to the evil entering the meridians. Swelling of the skin occurs because the qi of the sun dominates the surface. Abdominal fullness and decreased appetite indicate that water qi is attacking the spleen.) </p>
<p>The revival of the lesser yin brings inner heat, resulting in agitation, sneezing, and lower abdominal cramps, with fire manifesting and burning heat, dryness in the throat, and an interruption at the right times.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Air moves to the left, rising on the right; coughing, skin pain, sudden hoarseness, heart pain, confusion with an inability to recognize others, followed by cold sweats and trembling delirium. Cold precedes heat; thirst arises with a desire to drink; diminished energy with bone weakness; constipation due to obstructed intestines; externally, there is swelling and belching. </p>
<p>[Note: Sneezing indicates heat rising in the lungs. Lower abdominal cramping indicates the internal Yin energy rising below. Fire recognized as kindling derives from the upper Yang energy. Dry throat arises from fire consuming metal. When cold invades the abdomen, it leads to diarrhea; when nourished by fire, it can stop the diarrhea. Both Condition and function can appear simultaneously, causing intermittent diarrhea. Air moving to the left indicates that the vital fire energy arises from the water of the left kidney; rising on the right indicates the interaction between lung and kidney, where the kidney is fundamental and the lung is superficial. Excess fire in the lung can cause coughing and skin pain; metal governs sound, hence the sudden hoarseness. Heart pain results from self-inflicted fire energy. Confusion and inability to recognize others arise from chaotic cold and heat energies above. Sweats and tremors indicate a clash between Yin and Yang. The transition from cold to heat indicates that the cold of the lesser Yin is transformed into heat through fire. This leads to thirst and the desire to drink; excess fire causes diminished energy, and excessive heat leads to bone weakness. Belching indicates obstructed energy in the small intestine; reverse energy rises to the heart, causing belching.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Excesses</strong></p>
<p>To be rich at first and then poor, though not harmful in itself, may lead to the withering of the skin and the bending of the muscles, resulting in weakness and contraction. 【Note: Being rich at first and then poor harms one’s will and intention. Will and intention are what govern the spirit, gather the soul, adapt to cold and warmth, and balance joy and anger. Therefore, if honor and protective forces are in harmony, and will and intention are balanced, then the muscles and bones will be strong, and the pores will be tight. If will and intention are harmed, the spirit cannot be contained within, leading to the afflictions of the skin, muscles, and bones.】<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Longevity and Short Life</strong></p>
<p>When form and qi are in harmony, there is longevity; when they are not, there is early death. When skin and flesh support each other, there is longevity; when they do not, there is early death. When blood and qi dominate over form, there is longevity; when they do not, there is early death. [Note: &quot;Form&quot; refers to skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. The form and qi of a person are dictated by heavenly fate. Those with relaxed skin experience the flow of heavenly principles, thus relaxation leads to longevity, while tension leads to early death.]</p>
<p><strong>On the True Spirit</strong></p>
<p>The lungs, when overwhelmed by boundless joy, injure the po. When the po is injured, one becomes mad; in madness, the mind is lost. The skin becomes cracked and the hair wilts, resulting in a premature death in summer. [Note: Boundless joy refers to the emotional state of the heart. Joy without limits injures the po of the lungs. When the po is harmed, madness occurs, and with madness, the mind is lost. The mind is an expression of the heart; extreme joy causes the spirit to scatter and become absent. The lungs govern the skin and hair, hence the skin becomes cracked.]</p>
<p><strong>On Regulating Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the upper burner is expanded, it diffuses the essence of the five grains, moistening the skin and filling the body, like the irrigation of mist and dew; this is called qi. When grains enter and fill with qi, the essence flows into the bones, enabling the bones to bend and extend, nourishing the brain marrow and moistening the skin; this is called liquid. [Note: The qi of the upper burner disperses the essence of the grains, filling the skin and warming the flesh, thus moistening the skin like dew. When grains enter and fill with qi, the essence flows into the bones, allowing for movement and nourishing the brain marrow and moisturizing the skin; this is called liquid.]<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Distension</h3>
<p>Distension of the three burners occurs when qi fills the skin, causing a light but not firm sensation.</p>
<h3>Chapter on the Five Transformations</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we infer a person&#39;s susceptibility to consumption? Shao Yu responded: Those whose five organs are all soft and weak are prone to consumption. Such a person has thin skin and deep-set, firm eyes, with a vigorous and direct qi flow. Their heart is strong, and with strength comes anger; when angry, qi rises in rebellion, accumulating in the chest, causing a reverse flow of blood and qi, leading to fullness in the skin and muscles. When the blood vessels are obstructed, heat develops, and this heat consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. </p>
<p>[Note: The five organs are responsible for storing essence. If all five organs are weak, then fluids are exhausted and susceptibility to consumption increases. The body is an outward manifestation of the five organs; with thin skin and weak muscles, the five organs must be weak as well. Softness implies the necessity of strength; thus, if a person has thin skin but deep-set, firm eyes, their qi has the potential for vigorous upward movement. Their heart is strong, and with this strength comes frequent anger, which causes a rebellious rise of qi and results in an accumulation of blood in the chest. When the qi is obstructed, it becomes stagnant in the muscles, leading to the accumulation of blood, and stagnant blood transforms into heat. This heat then consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. This describes a person who is overly aggressive yet has weak muscles.]<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>On the Vital Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Vital Qi is what warms and separates the flesh, fills the skin, nourishes the pores, and governs opening and closing. When the Vital Qi is harmonious, the flesh separates and becomes beneficial, the skin adjusts and becomes supple, and the pores become dense. The lungs correspond to the skin. Thick skin indicates a thick large intestine, while thin skin indicates a thin large intestine. Loose skin around the abdomen indicates a long and large large intestine, while taut skin indicates a short and narrow large intestine. Smooth skin suggests a straight large intestine, whereas skin that closely adheres to the flesh indicates a compact large intestine. </p>
<p>The heart corresponds to the pulse. Thick skin corresponds to a thick pulse, and a thick pulse corresponds to a thick small intestine. Thin skin corresponds to a thin pulse, and a thin pulse corresponds to a thin small intestine. Loose skin corresponds to a slow pulse, and a slow pulse corresponds to a large and long small intestine. When the skin is thin and the pulse is weak, the small intestine will be small and short. If the yang meridians are mostly crooked, then the small intestine will be compact.</p>
<p>The kidneys correspond to the bones. Dense pores with thick skin indicate a thick sanjiao and bladder, while coarse pores with thin skin indicate a thin sanjiao and bladder. Loose pores indicate a relaxed sanjiao and bladder, while taut skin without fine hair indicates a tense sanjiao and bladder. Beautiful and coarse fine hair suggests a straight sanjiao and bladder, while sparse fine hair indicates a compact sanjiao and bladder.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: How do patients respond to the winds of the four seasons? Shao Yu replied: Those with yellow, thin skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous winds of spring; those with white, thin skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous winds of summer; those with green, thin skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous winds of autumn; those with red, thin skin and weak flesh cannot withstand the vacuous winds of winter. The Yellow Emperor asked: What about those with black skin? Shao Yu replied: Individuals with black skin who have thick skin and firm flesh are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons; however, those with thin skin and weak flesh, whose colors are not uniform, will fall ill when the long summer arrives with vacuous wind. Those with thick skin and firm flesh will not fall ill during this time. If they have thick skin and firm flesh, they must be heavily affected by cold, both externally and internally, to fall ill. The Yellow Emperor said: Good.</p>
<p>[Note: The skin and flesh connect to the essence of the five organs, so those with thin skin and weak flesh have a weak vital energy in the organs, which cannot resist the vacuous winds of the seasons. The vacuous wind refers to the evil wind that is unbalanced and weak. The black color pertains to the essence of water, discussing the thickness or thinness of kidney energy. Being unharmed by the winds of the seasons indicates the earth&#39;s strength throughout the seasons. Not falling ill from the long summer wind indicates that earth governs during this period. If someone with thick skin and firm flesh is harmed by the winds of the seasons, they are certainly heavily affected by cold. On earth, water represents cold; in heaven, it embodies coldness. The kidneys are the water organ, corresponding to the cold qi of the heavens; thus, those with black skin and thick, strong flesh who fall ill must be heavily affected by cold. They are afflicted both externally by the cold evil of heaven and internally by the harm to the kidney&#39;s water energy.]<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<h3>On Pain</h3>
<p>Humans with strong bones, weak tendons, relaxed muscles, and thick skin can endure pain, whether from needles, stones, or fire. In addition, those with dark, beautiful bones can withstand fire. Those with thin skin and strong bones cannot endure the pain from needles and stones, nor from fire.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Shaoyin is the embodiment of primordial essence and energy; the Yangming transforms the essence of water and grains. Therefore, the strength or weakness of tendons and bones, the firmness or tenderness of muscles, and the thickness or thinness of skin, as well as the distribution of pores, all rely on the energies of Shaoyin and Yangming. Those with dark and beautiful bones have a robust Shaoyin blood energy. Relaxed muscles and thick skin indicate a strong Yangming blood energy. Mo Zi Jin stated: The kidneys are the water organ; hence, those with abundant Shaoyin energy can endure fire. The Yangming holds the energy of autumn metal, thus those with weak energy cannot endure the pain from needles, stones, or fire.</p>
<h3>On Abnormal Defensive Qi</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How does one determine if a person is fat or thin, large or small? Bo Gao replied: Those who are fatty have abundant qi and relaxed skin, allowing their abdomen to hang down; those who are muscular have a large body; those who are fatty have a small body.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the defensive qi is strong, the pores are open and loose, which is why the fatty have abundant qi and relaxed skin, allowing the abdomen to hang down. The abdomen refers to the lower belly below the navel. Muscular individuals have a large body, indicative of strong and ample qi in their flesh. Those who are fatty have a small body because the defensive qi is deep and cannot fill the flesh completely, causing the fat membranes to connect and the muscles to be tight, resulting in a smaller body size.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Diagnosing Through the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>When the skin at the pulse is smooth, and has a moist texture, it indicates the presence of wind. If the flesh is weak, it suggests a comfortable state of repose. If there is loss of flesh, it signifies that cold and heat are not being treated. If the skin is smooth and oily, it indicates wind. If the skin is rough, similar to the scales of a dried fish, it suggests water retention due to drinking. If the skin is excessively warm and the pulse is strong and dry, the condition is due to heat; if the pulse is strong and smooth, it indicates an impending illness. When the skin is cold and the pulse is weak, it suggests low energy. If the skin is initially hot and later cold, that indicates a mix of cold and heat. If the skin is first cold, then becomes large and hot after some time, this too indicates a combination of cold and heat. </p>
<p><strong>Note: This diagnosis through the pulse reveals both external and internal ailments. The fluids saturate the skin, hence when the skin is smooth, it indicates the presence of wind affecting the skin while agitating its fluids. Fat, found within the muscles, indicates that wind is present within the muscles as well. External conditions manifest in the skin, which is considered yang, while sinews and bones are considered yin. Illness in the yang is referred to as wind, and illness in the yin is called obstruction. If the skin is rough, it signifies the obstruction of wind within the sinews and bones.</strong><a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>This indicates the smoothness of the flesh at the wrist and allows one to discern the shallow and deep qualities of the wind. The muscles are connected to the essential energies of the five internal organs and are governed by the earth element of the spleen. Therefore, if the flesh at the wrist is weak, it indicates a deficiency of spleen energy and affects the ability to rest comfortably. &quot;Jie&quot; refers to lethargy. If the flesh is depleted, the body is weakened. The interplay of cold and heat suggests a deficiency in yin, yang, blood, and qi. Yang deficiency leads to aversion to cold, while yin deficiency causes heat. The balance of yin and yang, as well as form and energy, all suffer from depletion and thus result in untreatable conditions. Like the scales of a withered fish, where the skin shows signs of coldness and bumps. Cold represents the energy of water, which adversely affects the internal environment, resulting in cold symptoms externally. In cases of warm diseases, cold toxins are stored in the skin, manifesting as warm disease in the spring; hence, if the skin feels hot and the pulse is strong and dry, one can infer the presence of warm disease. A strong and slippery pulse indicates that the illness is also emerging from the exterior. If the wrist skin is cold and the pulse is small, it signifies a lack of qi. Qi is what warms the skin and fleshy tissues, originating from yin internally and manifesting externally, indicating internal depletion and external weakness. The wrist skin can exhibit heat followed by cold, or cold followed by heat, yet both reflect the influences of cold and heat, with the wrist governing the energies of the three yin and three yang.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Needling and Its True Nature</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What about acupuncture? Qi Bo replied: Yin and Yang represent the changes of cold and heat. When it is hot, it nourishes rain from above; the roots and branches have little juice, the vital energy is outside, the skin is relaxed, the pores open, the blood and energy decrease, and sweat flows profusely, making the skin moist. When it is cold, the earth freezes and water turns to ice, the vital energy is internal, the skin is taut, the pores close, sweat does not flow, the blood and energy are strong, and the flesh is firm and dense. </p>
<p>To treat cold-induced disorders, one must first warm the body, harmonize the meridians, and align the palms with the armpits, elbows with the feet, and the neck with the spine to restore balance. Once the fire energy is free-flowing, the blood vessels will circulate. Then observe the condition: if the flesh is moist, needling can level it; if it is hard and tight, one must break it up and disperse it until the energy settles, which is what we call resolving blockages.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The balance of Yin and Yang in humans responds to the seasonal changes of cold and heat. In heat, the vital essence rises, leading to increased perspiration and a decrease in internal blood energy, emphasizing that human vitality stems from the essence of the lower abdomen. In cold, the freezing ground and icy water lead to internal consolidation, making the skin dense and sweat absent, thus strengthening the internal blood and energy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>To treat the condition, one must first warm and circulate the qi; harmonize the meridians to ensure their smooth flow. This refers to the essence and qi received from the heavens that circulates both within and outside the meridians. Adjust the hands and armpits, the elbows and feet, the neck and spine, indicating that the flow of blood and qi should be comprehensive and reach every corner. When there is excessive stagnation, it should be needled to smooth it out; when there is hardness or tightness, it should be broken apart and dispersed. This is what is meant by using needles to resolve knots.</p>
<p>As for the influence of external evils, they can provoke movement in the body, causing the fine hairs to stand and affecting the skin and pores. If they penetrate deeply and strike the bones, it leads to bone pain; if they affect the tendons, it results in tendon spasms; if they strike within the vessels, it causes blood stasis, leading to boils; if they engage the flesh and combat the defensive qi, if yang prevails, it results in heat, while if yin prevails, it results in cold. Cold causes the True Qi to retreat; when it retreats, there is emptiness, and when empty, cold attacks between the skin and muscle, causing the qi to move outward, pores to open, fine hairs to tremble, and when qi circulates, it creates itching; if it remains without moving, it results in numbness and when the defensive qi does not circulate, it leads to insensitivity.</p>
<p>Note: This discusses the harm caused by external evils to the body. Their movement can cause stagnation and spasms in skin, muscle, tendons, and bones, leading to pain or itching. The predominance of yin leads to cold, and with cold, the True Qi retreats. Injury to the defensive qi results in numbness, all of which arise from pathogenic influences.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</strong></p>

<p><strong>Skin Aggregation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Damage at the skin level results in the skin accumulating, leading to hair loss; </li>
<li>Damage to the blood vessels causes them to be weak and insufficient, unable to nourish the organs; </li>
<li>Damage to the muscles leads to emaciation, so that food cannot sustain the skin; </li>
<li>Damage to the tendons causes them to slacken and unable to hold; </li>
<li>Damage to the bones results in weakness, preventing one from getting out of bed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The opposite of these leads to the resolution of diseases. Disorders arising from above, where bone weakness prevents one from getting out of bed, result in death; disorders arising from below, where skin accumulates leading to hair loss, also result in death.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Skin Pain</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold and heat diseases, how should one observe? Indeed. If the skin experiences cold and heat, it should not be near the mat; the hair becomes scorched, the nose is dry and lacks sweat. If the muscles experience cold and heat, there will be skin pain, the lips and tongue will be parched, and there will be no sweat. [Note: The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: If the skin experiences cold and heat, it should not be near the mat; the hair becomes scorched, the nose is dry and lacks sweat. One should take the channels of the three yang to compensate for the hand’s greater yin. If the muscles experience cold and heat, there will be muscle pain, the hair becomes scorched and the lips dry and parched, and there will be no sweat. One should take the three yang from below to dispel the blood, and sufficiently compensate the greater yin to induce sweating.]</p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong></p>
<p>When jaundice is relieved by alcohol, for a long time it becomes black jaundice; the eyes are blue and the face is dark, and the heart feels as if it is eating garlic. The stool is completely black. The skin and nails show numbness; the pulse is floating and weak, though blackish with a slight yellow tinge, thus it can be discerned.</p>
<p><strong>Strange Condition</strong></p>
<p>Exhausted from five labors, emaciated, feeling fullness in the abdomen that prevents eating, suffering from food injury, worry injury, drink injury, sexual injury, hunger injury, overwork injury, and injury to the channels and vessels, there is internal stagnation of blood. The skin appears strange, the eyes are dark, the middle is slow and requires tonifying. Da Huang (Rhubarb) and a parasite pill are used for treatment. For intestinal abscesses, the body appears strange, the abdominal skin is tense, and pressing feels like a swelling; the abdomen has no accumulation, the body is not hot, and the pulse is rapid. This indicates intestinal pus, for which Yi Yi Ren (Job&#39;s tears) and Fu Zi (Aconite) with Bai Jiang Can (Silkworm) powder should be utilized.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis [Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dryness and Roughness</strong></p>
<p>When all three pulse regions are slow, the kidneys are cold, and the skin feels dry and coarse. If the pulse is deep and fine yet slippery, it indicates bone steaming. Both skin and hair are generally brittle, with cold and heat interlinked. The air from the mouth and nose does not return, and the lips are dark, resembling coal. The skin and hair are scorched and the nails are brittle; within three days, a calamity is surely known.</p>
<p><strong>Pain and Sourness</strong></p>
<p>When all three pulse regions are floating, the lungs are affected by wind, with copious nasal discharge and thick saliva. There is robust heat and aversion to cold, with pain in the flesh. The throat feels dry, and the eyes weep with sour pain. A weak pulse at the Guan (gate) indicates Yang deficiency, while therein much Qi is dispersed. If in the wrist the Yin Qi is exhausted, sour pain will radiate to the skin above.</p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions [Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vacuum and Solid</strong></p>
<p>The five viscera and six bowels correspond internally to the bones and marrow and externally to the skin and flesh. If illness arises externally, the skin, flesh, and mouth feel tense and urgent; if illness arises internally, there will be sour pain in the bones and marrow. Thus, with Yin and Yang manifesting outside and marrow inside, the origins of the illness must be examined in detail. If the skin is deficient, it indicates cold; if the skin is solid, it indicates heat. Generally, the responses of skin deficiency or solidity correspond to the lungs and large intestine, with disease manifesting in the skin and hair. Heat correlates to the viscera, and cold correlates to the bowels.</p>
<p><strong>Living Person&#39;s Book [Song Dynasty, Zhu Gong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Cold in the Skin and Heat in the Marrow, and Heat in the Skin and Cold in the Marrow</strong><a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The patient presents with intense fever yet desires clothing; the heat is on the skin, while the cold resides in the bone marrow. Zhang Zhongjing has no treatment for this. Firstly, administer Yindan decoction to clear the cold; then follow with Xiao Chaihu decoction with cinnamon to warm the exterior. Conversely, if the patient shows marked chill and does not want to approach clothing, the cold is on the skin while the heat lies in the bone marrow. Zhang Zhongjing also has no treatment for this. Initially, give Baihu decoction with ginseng to eliminate the heat; then use Cinnamon Twig and Ephedra decoction in equal parts to resolve the exterior. Generally, diseases have superficial and deep aspects, and treatment follows a sequence. For exterior heat with interior cold, the pulse must be deep and slow, the hands may feel slightly numb, and there may be diarrhea of clear fluids, which explains why even the Yin syndrome can show fever; for this, use Si Nerve or Tongmai Si Nerve decoction. For exterior cold with interior heat, the pulse must be slippery and contracted, with dryness of the mouth and tongue; thus, the Shaoyin syndrome horrible chill and curling up indicates repeated annoyance and a disinclination for thick clothing; treat with Dashaihu decoction. These are all supplementary discussions by Zhang Zhongjing.</p>
<p>As for itching, when it prompts scratching, scratching signifies fire transformation. Mild itching can also occur, but severe itching leads to rash, which is due to the skin becoming spicy and thus classified under the metal transformation. The spicy can disperse fire; hence, when metal transformation appears, the power of fire is decomposed. If a person is near fire, slight heat causes itching; excessive heat leads to pain, and proximity results in burning and sores—this is all due to fire. Itching is a beautiful ailment; hence, fire is strong in summer, and all things flourish beautifully. Some say pain is substantial, while itching is insubstantial, not because insubstantial implies cold, but because it denotes varied intensities of heat.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Dryness and Cracking of the Skin</strong></p>
<p>Cracking refers to the splitting of the skin. The dry element corresponds to heaven and represents the dry metal, while the damp element corresponds to earth and represents wet soil. Heaven and earth are opposites, and dryness and dampness have different uses. Hence, dry metal emphasizes tightness and contraction, leading to tight, fine, and subtle pulses in autumn; while damp soil emphasizes relaxation and expansion, resulting in broad and long pulses in June. When the earth is damp, it is relaxed and smooth; when dry, it is tight and rough. The principle of cracking is evident. </p>
<p>Commonly, it is said that cracking is caused by wind, as wind can overcome dampness, causing dryness. The classics say that when the jueyin reaches, it is considered a wind palace and a barrier, as wind overcomes dampness leading to dryness. The saying that cold months are severe while hot months are mild is due to cold&#39;s ability to contract and close the pores, leading to dryness without sweating, hence the severity of the illness. Heat leads to relaxed skin, with open pores allowing sweat to moisten, thus the illness diminishes.</p>
<p>Some people may experience cracking in the skin due to water moisture, as moisture itself invites wind and cold. All forms of roughness and desiccation are related to dryness. Roughness and desiccation result from a depletion of fluids and energy, leading to insufficient nourishment of blood to the skin and muscle, hindering the flow of energy, hence resulting in cracking and dryness; when severe, there may be numbness and paralysis. Desiccation is characterized by a lack of water and an excess of heat. As stated in the &quot;Xici,&quot; nothing dries out all things more than fire. Therefore, when fire is extremely hot, and water is depleted, it fails to moisten the body, causing the skin to crack, with the hands and feet appearing as if deeply wounded, as though by an axe, two to three tenths deep. This condition is worse in winter and less severe in summer.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Therefore, the method states that cold can contract, and contraction leads to dryness and scaly skin; heat can spread and relax, and spreading leads to nourishment and moisture, all belonging to the transformation of the dry metal element. Wang’s note says that living things are smooth and beneficial, while dead things are dry and desolate. For the purpose of treatment, one should open pathways, nourish yin and reduce yang, use cooling medicines for adjustment, ensure blood flows smoothly, and address numbness and insensitivity. Conditions of dryness, desiccation, and scaly skin should be appropriately managed, being careful not to use medicines that cause dark attachments. The classic mentions the movement of the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and the transformations brought by cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind; hence, the heavenly principles are visible, and the illnesses of the people can be understood. All diseases fall under the five elements and the six qi, adhering to the principles of overcoming strength and vulnerability. Wang’s note adds that humans, being physical, cannot be without afflictions, and once afflictions exist, there are always ways to escape from them and reconcile yin and yang.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said: Carefully guard against the onset of disease, with each performing their appropriate role. Those who possess should seek it, and those who do not should also seek it. The strong are held accountable, as are the weak. One must prioritize the five victories, disperse the blood and qi, allowing for smooth flow and achieving harmony—this is what is meant. </p>
<p>Dryness and desiccation are the roots of metal and the lungs. The lungs store qi, and internal damage from blood loss leads to qi deficiency; in such cases, wind can provoke cracks and eruptions. Wind overcomes dampness, and heat depletes fluids, both contributing to dryness. Therefore, the classics state that wind, heat, and fire together are yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness constitute yin. Moreover, dry and damp are different from each other. However, despite dryness being associated with autumn and yin, its nature is unlike that of cold dampness. </p>
<p>Dryness of metal, though influenced by wind and heat, is characterized by its fiery nature. Hence, when wind and heat become severe, they are akin to dryness. Furthermore, internal cold leading to vomiting or diarrhea resulting in fluid loss also causes dryness, and this is likewise addressed in the texts. Therefore, the classics state that all symptoms of withering and crackling dryness belong to the category of dryness. </p>
<p>— From Dongyuan’s Ten Books [Yuan Dynasty, Li Gao]</p>
<p>— General Treatise on the Skin<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The heart governs nourishment, and the lungs govern protection. Nourishment refers to blood. The pulse is the residence of blood and spirit. Protection is another name for the vital energy and the seven spirits, which guard the body and are located between the skin and hair. When the lungs fail, the skin and hair are the first to fail; without a place for the spirit to depend, if internal damage occurs from food and drink, one is also susceptible to wind and cold. This indicates a failure of nourishment and protection; without yang to nourish, the skin cannot withstand wind and cold. When the skin and hair fail, the source of the heart and lungs is also lost. If the stomach&#39;s energy does not rise, vital energy does not generate; without nourishment for the heart and lungs, this leads to deficiency.</p>
<p>Dryness</p>
<p>The large intestine is associated with the metal element and dryness, governing fluid. The small intestine is associated with the fire element and heat, governing liquid. Both are related to the stomach. If the stomach is deficient, it cannot receive energy and also becomes deficient; fluids do not moisten, leading to dryness and thirst upon waking, and the skin lacks moisture.</p>
<p>Dry Itch</p>
<p>When the skin is dry and itchy, the text states: all itching arises from deficiency, as the blood does not nourish the skin. One should use tonifying herbs to nourish yin and blood, harmonizing the blood and moistening the muscles, causing the itch to cease.</p>
<p>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method (Yuan - Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p>Conditions Corresponding to Meridians</p>
<p>When the body lacks moisture, it is reflected in the foot shaoyang gallbladder meridian.<br>When energy is full, the skin feels tight yet does not hurt; this is reflected in the hand yangming large intestine meridian.<br>When the skin itches violently, it is reflected in the foot jueyin liver meridian.<br>When the skin hurts and feels numb, it is reflected in the hand taiyin lung meridian.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Medical Transmission</strong><br><strong>(Ming: Yu Tuan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cracking and Peeling</strong><br>Danxi said: When the skin cracks and peels, leading to blood loss and severe pain, or if the skin is dry and itchy, it is due to fire damaging the lung&#39;s metal element, causing excessive dryness. It is advisable to use the Four Substance Decoction with Chuanxiong, adding ingredients like Mai Men Dong, Ren Shen, Tian Hua Fen, Huang Bo, and Wu Wei Zi to treat it.</p>
<p><strong>Key Treatment Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming: Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Itching</strong><br>In the summer months, if the body itches as if pricked by needles, with some areas becoming red and swollen, it is also known as summer wind, affecting the finer hairs. If vital energy is deficient, the skin and hair become scorched, leading to a loss of body fluids. If the skin is entirely compromised, with the fluids having been depleted, the claws become brittle, and hair breaks off. Broken hair means that the hair has died first.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with Heart Fire</strong><br>Skin pain is linked to excess heart energy. The classics say: The summer pulse relates to the heart; excessive summer pulse results in bodily heat and skin pain from immersion. Skin pain resulting from qi stagnation is attributed to fire evil harming the lungs. The classics state that when the Shaoyin is at the spring, heat excess prevails, causing cold and heat-related skin pain. Furthermore, it says that Shaoyin controls heaven; when fire excess prevails, skin pain arises. It also states that when the Shaoyin recurs, there may be coughing and skin pain, which should be treated with various cooling remedies.</p>
<p><strong>Itching Due to Blood Deficiency</strong><br>The classics mention that all itching is caused by deficiency. When blood does not nourish the skin and pores, itching occurs. One should use nourishing medicines to support yin blood, harmonizing the blood and moisturizing the skin, thus preventing itching.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p>
<h3>Dryness of the Skin</h3>
<p>The skin being dry, as referred to by Zhang Zhongjing as &quot;the skin being rough and parched,&quot; indicates skin that is not smooth or moist. When the skin is dry due to internal dryness damaging the gallbladder&#39;s energy, it is stated that the Yangming channel is affected; dryness prevails, leading to a condition where the body lacks moisture. Therefore, it should be treated with bitter and cold remedies.</p>
<h3>Cracking</h3>
<p>The scriptures state: All instances of roughness and dryness, as well as cracking, are attributable to dryness. When dry qi resides internally, it consumes bodily fluids, causing constipation and thirst, while the blood vessels dry up and energy becomes stagnant. This can result from overindulgence in spicy and rich foods, which exacerbates fire evils, lying dormant within the blood and depleting true yin, leading to a deficiency in fluids and occasional dryness; or from wind dryness on the surface, affecting the skin, resulting in rough, dry, itchy hair and strong, tense nails, difficulty in opening the mouth, accompanied by coldness and spasms of the muscles, excessive saliva in the chest, and dry syndromes such as mental confusion and rigidity—all stemming from a deficiency of yin blood that cannot restrain fire; when fire burns fiercely, it overcomes metal, and when metal is affected by evil, it cannot control wood, causing the liver qi to become excessively strong, leading to the internal generation of wind evils and resulting in these ailments. </p>
<p>The methods for treatment are to use warming spices to moisten, bitter herbs to drain, nourish yin and blood for those who are deficient; to drain fire and soften hardness for those suffering from fire; and to dispel wind and resolve stagnation for those affected by wind. These three strategies are the principal methods for treating conditions of dryness.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Skin Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Skin-related ailments are mostly caused by cold; they worsen in cold conditions and improve with heat, responding to the lungs. The symptoms include a lack of sensation in the skin, along with breathlessness and fullness.</p>
<p><strong>The Six Essentials of Medical Standards</strong> - Ming, Zhang Sanxi</p>
<p><strong>Lungs Correspond to Skin</strong></p>
<p>When any of the five organs is deficient, symptoms will manifest externally. The lungs govern qi and control the skin and hair. If the lungs are deficient, the complexion becomes pale, there is excessive sweating, and breath becomes labored. To replenish its flow and restore its source is indeed skillful treatment. A deficiency in the lungs leads to scorched skin and hair, a depletion of fluids, weakness, abdominal distension, and breathlessness. It is advisable to use Ziwancao decoction with ginseng, astragalus, and white quartz.</p>
<p><strong>Dryness and Peeling</strong></p>
<p>Mostly caused by fiery blood and qi, resulting in dryness. As the &quot;I Ching&quot; states, &quot;Nothing dries out all things like fire.&quot; Externally, it leads to dry and scorched skin; internally, it manifests as dry throat and mouth, and constant thirst. Treatment should focus on generating fluids, nourishing blood, cooling the blood, and moistening dryness. It is crucial to avoid drying agents, such as pinellia and atractylodes.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>Ming - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Itching and Dryness</strong>  </p>
<p>For itching caused by stagnant heat in the skin, it is advisable to clear heat, disperse wind, and cool the blood, with the method of harmony being excellent. The classics say: all itching arises from deficiency. The lungs govern Qi and control the skin and hair; when Lung Qi is obstructed and leads to itching, it is necessary to ward off wind and supplement with ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes. When the defensive Yang is firm, leading to closed and stagnant heat, and when the defensive Qi is disharmonious, one should adjust Qi and harmonize blood to dispel stagnation. Liu Hejian differentiates between constipation or thirst, recognizing them as internal manifestations of dryness; when the body is hot, skin is dry, and conditions like dry scabies and rough skin exist, these reflect external manifestations of dryness. In cases of Yang and Yin stagnation, and when Qi and blood are deficient and stagnated, wind and heat can be diagnosed accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>Ming - Wang Kentang</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong>  </p>
<p>If there is numbness between the skin, this is due to the stagnation of Lung Qi; thus, the prescription of Shao Yao Bu Qi Decoction is recommended. If wind and dampness invade the kidney channel, leading to blood stasis, with swelling and pain in the lower back, inability to turn or shift, numbness in the skin, generalized numbness, swelling in the neck and head, frequent ringing in the ears, low pain and weakness in the legs and knees, difficulty in walking, and stiffness in the neck and back preventing relaxation, one should use the Blood Activating Pain Relief Pill.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Secret Text of the Stone Chamber</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sound of Insects Beneath the Skin</strong></p>
<p>When a person has sounds beneath the skin, particularly between the hands and feet, resembling singing from an earthworm, this indicates that moisture has given rise to insects. One should apply earthworm dung to the affected area; when the sound ceases, then mix with water and apply a thick layer about an inch deep. When the sound stops, brew a decoction. Use five qian each of Atractylodes and Saposhnikovia, one liang each of Job&#39;s tears and water chestnut, three qian of raw licorice, two qian of scutellaria, and three fen of aconite; boil with water and take it to achieve healing. This treatment eliminates the moisture that nourishes the insects, especially with raw licorice to detoxify and transform the insects, and with Saposhnikovia to expel wind and eliminate stasis, while aconite destroys barriers and expels evil, thus achieving miraculous results.</p>
<p><strong>Cracks</strong></p>
<p>If there seems to be something moving in the throat, coughing up phlegm worsens the pain, and the skin on the body cracks with fluid leaking out; the eyes become red and swollen but are not painful, and the feet swell like pots but can still be used; this is a truly rare affliction. It is caused by eating raw vegetables that had centipedes on the leaves, without realizing it, leading to centipedes arising in the stomach. When they enter the stomach, it causes pain, and if they rise to the throat, it causes throat pain, worsening with hunger. Take a whole chicken, cook it until done, season with five spices to create an enticing aroma, and place it near the patient as they sleep; the centipedes will naturally crawl out. Should any centipedes emerge, catch them immediately, preventing them from re-entering the mouth. Whether one or several come out, getting them all out leads to recovery. Generally, if there is no movement in the throat, there are no centipedes present.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Then take three qian of fresh licorice, one liang each of coix seed, angelica, and astragalus, three liang of poria, five qian of white peony, five fen of siler, and one qian each of schizopePodium and dried tangerine peel. Decoction in water for ten doses will heal the cracked skin, and the swelling of the feet will also diminish. The centipede resides in the upper cavity; no medicine can kill it. If the medicine goes down the throat, it reaches the stomach, but the centipede remains above the stomach, so it cannot be killed. Thus, it is necessary to draw it out, and then treat the qi and blood with medicine to facilitate healing. Cracked skin occurs because the centipede&#39;s toxic gas lingers near the lungs, which govern the skin and hair, hence the skin cracks. The swelling of the feet corresponds to the kidneys; the lungs are situated above and are considered the mother of the kidneys. When the mother is ill, the child also suffers. However, the kidney water is ultimately not deficient, but the toxic gas lingers in the kidney region, causing the skin of the feet to be swollen and tense, not a bone disease. Thus, they can still walk. The eyes are associated with the liver, which is affected by the toxic qi from the lungs, resulting in redness and swelling.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Method of Steaming with Caltrops</strong></p>
<p>To treat the deficiency of the skin and to address the cold air obstructing the large intestine, take one斗 of fine bran, and cut three升 of caltrop roots and leaves, two升 each of sliced calamus leaves and peach leaf branches, and five升 of glutinous rice. Combine these five ingredients and cook them in 1石 and 5斗 of water until the rice is fully cooked. Store this in a large basin, then create a small bamboo bed to cover the basin, with a person sitting on the bed in the middle. Surround the area with matting to block the wind, and cover the body with clothing and blankets. When breathing occurs, create an opening in the middle to release the steam; this can help the whole body to sweat profusely, possibly for two meals&#39; duration. Repeat this for three days, steaming with the warm medicine and allowing for good sweating. If the basin is not hot enough, place charcoal fire underneath. This method is effective not only for treating cold but also for addressing all labor-induced coolness in the skin.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Gardenia Decoction</strong>: Treats skin heat, primarily for lung diseases.<br>Ingredients:  </p>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>&quot;The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: When illness is in the hair and pores, needling the hair does not harm the skin; if the skin is harmed, it affects the lungs, and if the lungs are affected, it causes autumn illnesses and chills from cold. The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a method to needle the six organs? Qibo replied: To needle here, one must hit the qi points. You must not touch the flesh knots; if you hit the qi points, the needle travels through the channels, but pain will be felt in the flesh knots. Supplementing and draining improperly will worsen the illness. If targeting the tendons, relax the tendons so that the evil qi does not escape. Instead of dispersing it outside, it remains inside. Not using the needle correctly, following the wrong principles leads to reversed outcomes. Cold qi resides in the skin, with a predominance of yin and deficiency of yang, causing chills and trembling; thus, one must supplement all yang. For diseases located in inconsistent areas of the skin, use a perforating needle at the affected site, avoiding areas that are too pale. </p>
<p>When using a straight needle, pull the skin taut before piercing; this treats superficial cold. The so-called three punctures to release the qi involves first superficially piercing to release the yang evil, then needling again to bring out the yin evil, going deeper to avoid the muscle without penetrating into the layers of flesh.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>Once one has entered the realm of flesh, the qi of grain is released. For half-needling, it penetrates shallowly and swiftly, without piercing the flesh, resembling the act of plucking hair to draw out the qi of the skin; this corresponds to the lung. In hot illnesses, there may be initial skin pain, nasal congestion, and facial fullness; treat the skin with the first needle, number fifty-nine. If the nose is obstructed and the skin is affected by the lung, do not seek the qi of fire, for fire corresponds to the heart. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one discern a disease of the skin? Bo Gao replied: When there is a color appearing between the two eyebrows that is thin and glossy, the disease is in the skin. The skin has sections, and these sections distribute to the four extremities. The Yellow Emperor asked: How should one treat it? Bo Gao replied: Diseases vary widely; they rise and fall, are deep or shallow, and cannot be exhausted. Each is in its place: the shallow ones are treated lightly, the severe ones more deeply, the intermediate ones minimally, and the severe ones with more intensity, adjusting the qi according to changes; hence it is said to be the work of a master.</p>
<p>For wind (or pathological water) causing skin swelling, it constitutes fifty-seven ailments; draw blood from the skin thoroughly. In cases of cold and heat in the skin, one cannot lie on the mat, hair scorches, the nose is dry and waxy, and sweating cannot be achieved; one should use the three yang channels to supplement the hand&#39;s taiyin. In spring, treat the collaterals, as they govern the skin.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The skin is associated with the lungs and represents the yang aspect of a person. Therefore, when treating it with needles, one must ensure the head of the needle is large and the tip sharp, allowing for no deep penetration while facilitating the outflow of yang energy. The <em>Classic of Acupuncture</em> states: In cases of heat diseases with headaches, symptoms include rapid pain extending from the corners of the eyes, irritability, fullness, lack of sweating, facial redness, and skin pain near the jaw—this pertains to the suspended thread. Coughing and vomiting, cold in the diaphragm, inability to eat, alternate chills and fever, skin and muscle pain, shortness of breath preventing sleep, fullness in the chest, tightness in both sides, a sense of unease in the diaphragm, side pain and abdominal pain, acute chest pain with shortness of breath, cold pain in the shoulders and back, lack of sweating, throat blockage, abdominal pain, accumulation, lack of speech accompanied by desire for rest, lethargy, persistent moistness of the body, and heart pain with no ability to disturb—the spleen point is indicated here. </p>
<p>In cases of sudden lung issues, chest pain, aversion to cold, fullness in the chest, and an overwhelming urge to vomit bile, heat in the chest, difficulty breathing, chasing qi, excessive saliva, inability to catch breath, wind and sweat emanating from the shoulders and back, swelling of the face and abdomen, undigested food in the diaphragm, inability to eat, throat blockage with shoulder tightness, lung distension, and pain in the skin and bones, alternating chills and fever with fullness—the middle fort is indicated here. </p>
<p>When there is fullness in the chest, pain in front of the ears, tooth pain, red and painful eyes, swollen neck with varying chills and heat, thirst leading to sweating, lack of thirst resulting in dry and hot skin—the crook pool point is indicated here. </p>
<p>In cases of edema, with water qi circulating in the skin, the yin intersection point is indicated.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Swelling and a distended abdomen caused by water retention, with water in the skin, is treated at the Shimen point. When the body is swollen and the skin feels so sensitive that it cannot touch clothing, accompanied by severe itching and eventual numbness, it is treated at the Wu Yi point. The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: skin pain is addressed by the lungs. The classics say that if the evil is in the lungs, the skin will hurt, along with symptoms of chills, heat, shortness of breath, sweating, and coughing affecting the shoulders and back. This is treated by pressure on the chest and sides of the back, followed by needling, with additional treatment at the Xuan point. When the skin feels rough and dry, one should treat the foot Shaoyang channel. The classics say that the channel of foot Shaoyang, when activated, indicates the body lacks moisture. This can be assessed based on the presence of excess heat or cold sinking downward. If one is affected by autumn wind, cold, and dampness, it leads to skin bi syndrome. If it persists, it will enter the lungs, causing symptoms like anxiety, fullness, shortness of breath, and vomiting, which can be treated at the Taiyuan and Hegu points. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states that Zhi Yin and Wu Yi treat generalized skin itching.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Secret Essentials for Life Preservation&quot; states: for itchy skin, use the guiding method. First, apply an external method, using heat at the tailbone while pressing and rubbing it with fingers until moisture resembling sweat emerges, leading to recovery. Next, stimulate the upper chest and expel phlegm, placing the hand over the abdomen and imagining the heat circulating to burn it within. Alternatively, one can start from the head and work down to the navel.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Health Treasure&quot; states: The Deputy Envoy of the State, Lord Tan, aged forty-nine, during the spring of the year of Bingyin in the Yuan dynasty, suffered from cold pain in the navel and abdomen, undigested food, cold and reverse sensitivity in the ankles, numbness in the skin, weakened spirit, and fatigue. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be deep, thin, and weak. He was then treated with a large dose of hot, sweet, and spicy medicine; and moxibustion was applied at Qihai and Sānli points with three seven-sticks each, and two seven-sticks at Yangfu each. However, after several days, there was still no significant change, and after ten days, the sores did not produce pus, with the wound edges remaining dry. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the year of Guichou, I was assigned to the winter camp at Guahudu and learned acupuncture from Mr. Dou Zisheng. I inquired about acupuncture points and was told: &quot;For acupuncture, if the Qi does not reach the point, it will not be effective, and the moxibustion will also fail. Generally, this is because the underlying Qi is deficient and cannot produce pus, thereby losing its nourishment.&quot; If care is not taken further, the evil Qi will increase, causing the illness to persist. Another day I conveyed this to the acupuncture and moxibustion experts, who also concurred. </p>
<p>In the spring of the year of Wuchan, the Deputy Envoy was appointed as the magistrate of Yidu Prefecture. Shortly after taking office, he developed wind illness, leading to numbness in half of his body, spontaneous sweating, intolerance to wind, unwarranted joy and laughter, increased forgetfulness, and slurred speech. The doctor administered a Sustaining Life Decoction, which caused his sweating to recur, and the fluid loss became worse. He then sought medical attention and returned home; over time, his spirit became muddled, his appearance emaciated, he lost taste in food, and had accidents with urination and defecation. He needed assistance to rise and tried various doctors and medicines, all to no avail. </p>
<p>He then recalled the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; stating: &quot;Yang Qi is like the heavens and the sun; if lost from its place, it leads to a shortened life and lack of vitality.&quot;<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Now, because of this illness, I understand the words of Master Sheng. Some say: &quot;The deputy&#39;s enjoyment lies in rich food and comfort for the body, provisions at hand for matters ahead, and he finds everything satisfactory. Why does the ruler say he has lost his nourishment?&quot; I reply: &quot;Your words refer to nourishment for the mouth and body. I speak of nourishment for life and essence.&quot; Furthermore, the Qian family, in their prime, gained success but did not comprehend the correct way to nourish themselves. They sought to satisfy their hearts, leading to a dissipated spirit, depleted energy, and resulting in this illness. The &quot;Spinal Classic&quot; states: At ten years old, the five organs begin to stabilize, and blood and energy flow; hence, one enjoys running. At twenty, blood and energy begin to flourish, muscles grow, and one enjoys walking briskly. At thirty, the five organs are well-established, muscles are firm, and blood and energy are abundant; thus, one enjoys walking. At forty, the organs, bowels, and twelve channels are all flourishing and balanced, pores begin to relax, and hair loses its luster, turning gray; steadiness prevails, and one enjoys sitting. At fifty, liver energy begins to decline, the liver becomes thin, bile diminishes, and vision starts to fail. At sixty, heart energy declines, one is prone to worry and sorrow, and blood and energy become sluggish; hence, one enjoys resting. At seventy, spleen energy begins to weaken, and skin becomes dry. At eighty, lung energy declines, the soul becomes scattered, and one speaks softly. At ninety, kidney energy is exhausted, organs wither, and channels become empty. At one hundred, all five organs are weakened, spirit and energy depart, and the body remains alone until the end. Thus, spirit is limited, while desires are endless, leading to the loss of life essence; once lost, it is hard to regain. Is this not the fate of the Qian family?<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>Zhang Zijing, the Provincial Physician, was sixty-seven years old, suffering from dim vision, slightly dark lips, and dull skin. His pulse was thin and weak. One day, he presented two prescriptions for treating his eyes and asked if he could take them. I replied: These medicines are based on extremely bitter huanglian as the main ingredient, with wind-dispelling herbs as assistants. Since the age of fifty, one&#39;s bile diminishes, leading to loss of sight. The Inner Canon states that the earth element governs and is purged by bitterness, and all wind-dispelling herbs also purge the earth. At seventy, one’s spleen and stomach become weak, leading to dry skin. Excessive purging of the earth will further deplete the spleen and stomach&#39;s energy, hindering its ability to nourish the vital energy, causing gastric energy not to ascend and creating ailments such as reflux and food rejection. Additionally, at an advanced age, one&#39;s daily routines are different. This medicine should not be taken; it is more advisable to be cautious with speech, moderate eating, and restrain anger and desires—this is a kind of treatment without medication. Zijing agreed with my assessment. The following spring, he retired from his position as inspector of the northwest and returned home, feeling clear-headed and his pulse became steady. This is the effect of not recklessly taking cold medicine. The Inner Canon says: Punishments without excess are termed great enlightenment; one may resolve them.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: In the north of Fangcheng, at a guesthouse by a solitary tree, there was an elderly man who pushed a small cart. His skin was cracked and very painful, and he could not grip the reins with his hands or touch the ground with his feet. On the cart lay a prepared medicine, which, when applied, worked immediately, allowing him to continue his journey the next day. Thereafter, it was repeatedly effective. The formula consists of fresh ginger juice, red clay, and white salt, combined with pig fat from the twelfth lunar month, ground, heated, and then rubbed into the cracks. Although it was painful at first, after a moment the skin softened and healed, and further applications brought comfort.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the West, the color is white, corresponding to the lungs, which open at the nose and store essence in the lungs. Therefore, when illness occurs in the shoulders, its taste is pungent, its nature is metal, it relates to horses, its grain is rice, and it corresponds to the four seasons, appearing as the Tai Bai star; thus, it is known that the illness is in the skin and fur. Its sound is &quot;shang,&quot; its number is nine, its smell is fishy.<br><em>[Note: The lungs govern the skin and fur, hence illness manifests in them.]</em></p>

Its brilliance is in the fur, its fullness is in the skin, being the Tai Yin among the Yang, connecting with the autumn qi.<br><em>[Note: The lung governs qi and stores the soul, hence it is the root of qi and the place of the soul.

Its sound is &quot;shang,&quot; the hair grows long, and hair adheres to the skin; with abundant qi, the fur flourishes. Excessive consumption of bitter is due to an excess of the fire flavor, which harms the lungs, resulting in withered skin and fallen fur.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The end of the Taiyin meridian indicates abdominal distension, inability to breathe, propensity to belch and vomit. If there is vomiting, there is a reversal of qi, which causes the face to turn red. If qi does not reverse, there will be blockage in the upper and lower parts, and without passage, the face will turn black, with the skin and hair becoming scorched, leading to a fatal outcome. </p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The foot Taiyin pulse enters the abdomen and is associated with the spleen, thus causing abdominal distension. The hand Taiyin pulse rises to the diaphragm, is related to the lungs, and governs respiration, hence the inability to breathe. When there is fullness, ascent and descent are difficult; when there is an inability to breathe, it indicates stagnation of qi. Belching leads to qi rising upwards, which causes a red face; if qi does not reverse, there is internal blockage, leading to a lack of passage between the upper and lower parts. When the spleen qi is deficient, it cannot control fluids, which is why the face turns black. When lung qi is deficient, the body does not function properly, resulting in dryness of skin and hair.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The flow of pulse qi travels through the meridians, and the essence of meridian qi returns to the lungs, with the lungs connecting to all hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin and hair.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Pulse qi consists of the essence of food and water that flows through the meridians. It refers to the qi of the food entering the stomach, first activating the qi in the vessels. The essence of the hundred vessels ultimately returns to the main meridian, and since the essence of the meridian returns to the lungs, all vessel qi converges in the lungs. The lungs connect with the skin and hair, thus distributing essence to them as well.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Bi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What is the cause of the Bi syndrome? Qi Bo replied: It arises from the mingling of the three qi: wind, cold, and damp, which combine to become Bi. When this occurs in autumn, it manifests as skin Bi. Therefore, when bone Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the kidneys; when muscle Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the liver; when pulse Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the heart; when flesh Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the spleen; when skin Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the lungs. Thus, the so-called Bi in each case arises from a strong external influence of wind, cold, and damp at that time. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Bi means blockage, and the malevolent factors block and cause pain. The description indicates that the three qi of wind, cold, and damp arrive mixed, creating Bi. The skin, flesh, muscles, and bones are related to the five organs, and the qi of the five organs corresponds externally to the four seasons. The initial manifestation occurs externally as a form, which then injures the internal five qi; the combination of external and internal influences leads to the blockage within. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Some cases of Bi lead to death, some cause prolonged pain, and some are easily resolved; what are the reasons for this? Qi Bo said: Those that invade the organs lead to death; those that linger between muscle and bone cause prolonged pain; those that remain within the skin are easily resolved. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the wind, cold, and damp penetrate the points, and the organ qi is strong, then the malevolent factor does not affect the organs. When the spirit and qi deplete, the Bi gathers in the organs and causes death. If it lingers between muscle and bone without affecting the organs, it causes prolonged pain. If it remains within the skin, it disperses easily with the qi.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it affects the pulse, then it internally connects to the five organs. Moreover, if the yin energy does not accumulate, the pathogenic factors directly enter the organs, resulting in incurable death. The Emperor said: Good. Why do blockages sometimes cause pain, sometimes not, sometimes numbness, sometimes cold or heat, sometimes dryness or dampness? Qi Bo replied: Pain occurs because of excessive cold; thus, there is pain from the presence of cold. Those that do not feel pain or numbness are due to long-term illness infiltrating deeply, causing the regulation of vital substances to be obstructed and the meridians to be intermittently blocked, hence the lack of flow. The skin does not receive nourishment, resulting in numbness.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a邪病 persists for a long time, the pathways of nourishment and defense become injured and flow weakly. If the邪 enters deeply, it does not cause blockage in the physical body but results in a temporary looseness in the meridians, hence there is no pain. When the pathways of nourishment and defense are weak, they cannot nourish the skin, leading to insensitivity.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: In the case of bi syndrome, why is there no pain? Qibo replied: When bi affects the bones, it feels heavy; when it affects the vessels, the blood stagnates and does not flow; when it affects the tendons, they cannot bend or extend; when it affects the flesh, there is insensitivity; when it affects the skin, it feels cold. Therefore, possessing these five conditions results in no pain.</p>
<p>Note: Bones have bone qi, vessels have vessel qi, tendons have tendon qi, flesh has flesh qi, and skin has skin qi, all of which correspond to the qi of the five organs and integrate with the physical body. If the body is affected but its qi is not injured, one only observes the heaviness of bone bi, the stagnation of blood in vessel bi, the inability to bend or extend in tendon bi, the insensitivity of flesh bi, and the coldness of skin bi. Hence, possessing these five physical symptoms results in no pain.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Skin and Its Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: I have heard that the skin has divisions, the vessels have pathways, the tendons have connections, and the bones have measurements, with each giving rise to different diseases. Please differentiate their divisions, left and right, up and down, the yin and yang locations, and the beginning and end of the diseases. I wish to know this principle.</p>
<p>Qibo replied: To understand the skin, we should regard the meridians as the framework; all meridians are like this. The yangming of the yang is called &quot;Hɑi Fei,&quot; following the same principle up and down. Looking at its section, if there are superficial connections, they all belong to the yangming connections. If the color is mostly blue, it indicates pain; if black, it indicates blockage; if yellow or red, it indicates heat; if white, it indicates cold; if all five colors are present, it indicates both cold and heat. If the connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. The yang governs the outer, while the yin governs the inner.</p>
<p>The shaoyang of the yang is called &quot;Shu Chi,&quot; which also follows the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections in this section, they all belong to the shaoyang connections. If the connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians; thus, those in the yang govern the inner, while those in the yin govern the outer, allowing for infiltration into the inner; all meridians follow this principle. </p>
<p>The taiyang of the yang is called &quot;Guan Shu,&quot; which again follows the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections here, they all belong to the taiyang connections. When connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. The shaoyin of the yin is called &quot;Shu Ru,&quot; also following the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections in this section, they all belong to the shaoyin connections. When connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. </p>
<p>Their entry into the meridians is through the yang section entering into the meridian; their exit is from the yin interior into the bones. The heart governs the yin, known as &quot;Hɑi Jian,&quot; which follows the same principle up and down.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>When there is an excess of Lesser Yin, the illness manifests as skin ailments, itching, and rashes. When there is a deficiency, it presents as lung-related issues. If it is slippery, it indicates lung wind hernia; if it is retentive, it suggests accumulation, urination, and blood issues.<br>(Note: The lungs govern the skin, and the networks combine with essence between the skin, which is why skin ailments and lung issues are linked to Lesser Yin. Hernias indicate an issue in Qi, while blood issues pertain to blood. The autumnal climate affects the skin; autumn marks the beginning of the gathering of atmospheric energy, leading to closed pores and tense skin.)</p>
<h3>Discussion on Governance Principles</h3>
<p>The Greater Yang governs the heavens; cold air descends, heart Qi ascends, and fire becomes evident, soil becomes moist, and water becomes abundant. As the cold guest arrives, the heavy Yin transforms into moisture; energies change substances. When water fills the interior, leading to saturation and inability to eat, skin and muscle become afflicted, and tendons and vessels are impeded. In severe cases, this results in swellings and carbuncles on the back.<br>(Note: When Greater Yang governs the heavens, the Lesser Yin&#39;s humid earth collects in springs, thus the soil becomes moist. &quot;Accumulation&quot; refers to storage; the affliction of skin and flesh arises from water and dampness.

<p>In the year when the Lesser Yin is in the spring, if the heat overcomes, then flames will rise over rivers and marshes, and the shadow will appear bright. The people suffer from a constant rumbling in the abdomen, the energy surges up to the chest, causing wheezing and inability to stand for long. There are chills and fevers, skin pain, closed eyes, and toothaches, swelling, and chills accompanied by fever resembling malaria. There is pain in the lower abdomen, an enlarged belly, and insects do not hide. </p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yin in spring refers to the year of the Rabbit and the Rooster. The fire of the Lesser Yin generates in the water, hence the flames rise over rivers and marshes. The Lesser Yin indicates shadow and fundamentally fire, thus the shadow appears bright. The constant rumbling in the abdomen signifies the bustling fire energy. The energy surging up to the chest indicates the fiery energy rising. Wheezing and inability to stand for long, along with chills and skin pain, result from the fire overpowering the lungs. Closed eyes signify extreme heat with Yin deficiency, causing aversion to sunlight. Toothaches and swelling occur due to heat overwhelming the Yang Ming. Fevers resembling malaria are due to the illness of the foundational energy of the Lesser Yin. Heat in the lower region causes pain in the lower abdomen, and heat in the middle region causes stomach distension.)</p>
<p>The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when overwhelmed by heat, the oppressive heat arrives, and the fire carries out its governance. The people suffer from vexing heat in the chest, dry throat, fullness on the right side of the abdomen, skin pain, chills, and cough with wheezing.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the Lesser Yin and Greater Yang, there is Yang within Yin and Yin within Yang. Yin and Yang follow each other, and their essence transforms; hence, when fire becomes exceedingly hot, great rain arrives; when water becomes extremely cold, it activates fire’s fierceness. The people suffer from heat and dryness in the chest, fullness on the right side, skin pain, the lungs feeling hot while bodily fluids fail to generate.</p>
<p>In the Lesser Yang, when Fire overpowers, warmth spreads. If metal governance is unbalanced, the people suffer from headaches, fever, chills, and malaria, skin pain from heat, complexion turning yellow and red, evolving into water disturbances, swelling in the body and face, fullness in the abdomen, difficult breathing, diarrhea with red and white discharge, sores, coughing up blood, irritability, and heat in the chest, and in severe cases, nosebleeds, with the illness originating in the lungs. If the heavenly treasury ends, it leads to death without treatment.</p>
<p>Note: The Lesser Yang commands the heavens, particularly in the years of the Tiger and Monkey. The domination of fire leads to the imbalance of metal governance. The fire in the Lesser Yang, prevailing in the heavens, causes summer heat, hence the people suffer from headaches, chills, malaria, skin heat, and color change. The water transmit back as it challenges the overflow of metal and water, resulting in swelling from water disease, leading to difficult breathing, with lung energy reversing, preventing rest. Discharges of red and white, sores, blood in the spittle, illustrate the heat&#39;s severity. Severe nosebleeds indicating involvement of the lungs result from excessive fire overpowering metal; therefore, the original illness lies in the lungs.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The cold water qi of the sun prevails, hence the frost and arrival.

The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that those suffering from hemorrhoids and malaria are afflicted by the sun&#39;s cold and heat. When collapse enters the stomach, it is because water invades the earth. The stomach connects to the heart, leading to heart pain. Ulcers emerging in the yin cause obstruction and mutual pulling of the yin thighs. The feet concerned with the sun dominate the muscles, thus the tension in muscles and tendons. Blood vessels weep and change color due to the evil entering the meridians. Swelling of the skin occurs because the qi of the sun dominates the surface. Abdominal fullness and decreased appetite indicate that water qi is attacking the spleen.) </p>

Confusion and inability to recognize others arise from chaotic cold and heat energies above. Sweats and tremors indicate a clash between Yin and Yang. The transition from cold to heat indicates that the cold of the lesser Yin is transformed into heat through fire. This leads to thirst and the desire to drink; excess fire causes diminished energy, and excessive heat leads to bone weakness.

<p><strong>On Longevity and Short Life</strong></p>
<p>When form and qi are in harmony, there is longevity; when they are not, there is early death. When skin and flesh support each other, there is longevity; when they do not, there is early death. When blood and qi dominate over form, there is longevity; when they do not, there is early death. [Note: &quot;Form&quot; refers to skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. The form and qi of a person are dictated by heavenly fate. Those with relaxed skin experience the flow of heavenly principles, thus relaxation leads to longevity, while tension leads to early death.]</p>
<p><strong>On the True Spirit</strong></p>
<p>The lungs, when overwhelmed by boundless joy, injure the po. When the po is injured, one becomes mad; in madness, the mind is lost. The skin becomes cracked and the hair wilts, resulting in a premature death in summer. [Note: Boundless joy refers to the emotional state of the heart. Joy without limits injures the po of the lungs. When the po is harmed, madness occurs, and with madness, the mind is lost. The mind is an expression of the heart; extreme joy causes the spirit to scatter and become absent. The lungs govern the skin and hair, hence the skin becomes cracked.]</p>
<p><strong>On Regulating Qi</strong></p>
<p>When the upper burner is expanded, it diffuses the essence of the five grains, moistening the skin and filling the body, like the irrigation of mist and dew; this is called qi. When grains enter and fill with qi, the essence flows into the bones, enabling the bones to bend and extend, nourishing the brain marrow and moistening the skin; this is called liquid. [Note: The qi of the upper burner disperses the essence of the grains, filling the skin and warming the flesh, thus moistening the skin like dew. When grains enter and fill with qi, the essence flows into the bones, allowing for movement and nourishing the brain marrow and moisturizing the skin; this is called liquid.]<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Chapter on the Five Transformations</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How can we infer a person&#39;s susceptibility to consumption? Shao Yu responded: Those whose five organs are all soft and weak are prone to consumption. Such a person has thin skin and deep-set, firm eyes, with a vigorous and direct qi flow. Their heart is strong, and with strength comes anger; when angry, qi rises in rebellion, accumulating in the chest, causing a reverse flow of blood and qi, leading to fullness in the skin and muscles. When the blood vessels are obstructed, heat develops, and this heat consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. </p>
<p>[Note: The five organs are responsible for storing essence. If all five organs are weak, then fluids are exhausted and susceptibility to consumption increases. The body is an outward manifestation of the five organs; with thin skin and weak muscles, the five organs must be weak as well. Softness implies the necessity of strength; thus, if a person has thin skin but deep-set, firm eyes, their qi has the potential for vigorous upward movement. Their heart is strong, and with this strength comes frequent anger, which causes a rebellious rise of qi and results in an accumulation of blood in the chest. When the qi is obstructed, it becomes stagnant in the muscles, leading to the accumulation of blood, and stagnant blood transforms into heat. This heat then consumes the skin, resulting in consumption. This describes a person who is overly aggressive yet has weak muscles.]<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Vital Qi is what warms and separates the flesh, fills the skin, nourishes the pores, and governs opening and closing. When the Vital Qi is harmonious, the flesh separates and becomes beneficial, the skin adjusts and becomes supple, and the pores become dense. The lungs correspond to the skin. Thick skin indicates a thick large intestine, while thin skin indicates a thin large intestine. Loose skin around the abdomen indicates a long and large large intestine, while taut skin indicates a short and narrow large intestine. Smooth skin suggests a straight large intestine, whereas skin that closely adheres to the flesh indicates a compact large intestine. </p>
<p>The heart corresponds to the pulse. Thick skin corresponds to a thick pulse, and a thick pulse corresponds to a thick small intestine. Thin skin corresponds to a thin pulse, and a thin pulse corresponds to a thin small intestine. Loose skin corresponds to a slow pulse, and a slow pulse corresponds to a large and long small intestine. When the skin is thin and the pulse is weak, the small intestine will be small and short. If the yang meridians are mostly crooked, then the small intestine will be compact.</p>
<p>The kidneys correspond to the bones. Dense pores with thick skin indicate a thick sanjiao and bladder, while coarse pores with thin skin indicate a thin sanjiao and bladder. Loose pores indicate a relaxed sanjiao and bladder, while taut skin without fine hair indicates a tense sanjiao and bladder.

Shao Yu replied: Individuals with black skin who have thick skin and firm flesh are not harmed by the winds of the four seasons; however, those with thin skin and weak flesh, whose colors are not uniform, will fall ill when the long summer arrives with vacuous wind. Those with thick skin and firm flesh will not fall ill during this time. If they have thick skin and firm flesh, they must be heavily affected by cold, both externally and internally, to fall ill. The Yellow Emperor said: Good.</p>
<p>[Note: The skin and flesh connect to the essence of the five organs, so those with thin skin and weak flesh have a weak vital energy in the organs, which cannot resist the vacuous winds of the seasons. The vacuous wind refers to the evil wind that is unbalanced and weak. The black color pertains to the essence of water, discussing the thickness or thinness of kidney energy. Being unharmed by the winds of the seasons indicates the earth&#39;s strength throughout the seasons. Not falling ill from the long summer wind indicates that earth governs during this period. If someone with thick skin and firm flesh is harmed by the winds of the seasons, they are certainly heavily affected by cold. On earth, water represents cold; in heaven, it embodies coldness. The kidneys are the water organ, corresponding to the cold qi of the heavens; thus, those with black skin and thick, strong flesh who fall ill must be heavily affected by cold. They are afflicted both externally by the cold evil of heaven and internally by the harm to the kidney&#39;s water energy.]<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Pain</h3>
<p>Humans with strong bones, weak tendons, relaxed muscles, and thick skin can endure pain, whether from needles, stones, or fire. In addition, those with dark, beautiful bones can withstand fire. Those with thin skin and strong bones cannot endure the pain from needles and stones, nor from fire.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Shaoyin is the embodiment of primordial essence and energy; the Yangming transforms the essence of water and grains. Therefore, the strength or weakness of tendons and bones, the firmness or tenderness of muscles, and the thickness or thinness of skin, as well as the distribution of pores, all rely on the energies of Shaoyin and Yangming. Those with dark and beautiful bones have a robust Shaoyin blood energy. Relaxed muscles and thick skin indicate a strong Yangming blood energy. Mo Zi Jin stated: The kidneys are the water organ; hence, those with abundant Shaoyin energy can endure fire. The Yangming holds the energy of autumn metal, thus those with weak energy cannot endure the pain from needles, stones, or fire.</p>
<h3>On Abnormal Defensive Qi</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How does one determine if a person is fat or thin, large or small? Bo Gao replied: Those who are fatty have abundant qi and relaxed skin, allowing their abdomen to hang down; those who are muscular have a large body; those who are fatty have a small body.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the defensive qi is strong, the pores are open and loose, which is why the fatty have abundant qi and relaxed skin, allowing the abdomen to hang down. The abdomen refers to the lower belly below the navel. Muscular individuals have a large body, indicative of strong and ample qi in their flesh. Those who are fatty have a small body because the defensive qi is deep and cannot fill the flesh completely, causing the fat membranes to connect and the muscles to be tight, resulting in a smaller body size.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Diagnosing Through the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>When the skin at the pulse is smooth, and has a moist texture, it indicates the presence of wind. If the flesh is weak, it suggests a comfortable state of repose. If there is loss of flesh, it signifies that cold and heat are not being treated. If the skin is smooth and oily, it indicates wind. If the skin is rough, similar to the scales of a dried fish, it suggests water retention due to drinking. If the skin is excessively warm and the pulse is strong and dry, the condition is due to heat; if the pulse is strong and smooth, it indicates an impending illness. When the skin is cold and the pulse is weak, it suggests low energy. If the skin is initially hot and later cold, that indicates a mix of cold and heat. If the skin is first cold, then becomes large and hot after some time, this too indicates a combination of cold and heat. </p>
<p><strong>Note: This diagnosis through the pulse reveals both external and internal ailments. The fluids saturate the skin, hence when the skin is smooth, it indicates the presence of wind affecting the skin while agitating its fluids. Fat, found within the muscles, indicates that wind is present within the muscles as well. External conditions manifest in the skin, which is considered yang, while sinews and bones are considered yin. Illness in the yang is referred to as wind, and illness in the yin is called obstruction. If the skin is rough, it signifies the obstruction of wind within the sinews and bones.</strong><a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This indicates the smoothness of the flesh at the wrist and allows one to discern the shallow and deep qualities of the wind. The muscles are connected to the essential energies of the five internal organs and are governed by the earth element of the spleen. Therefore, if the flesh at the wrist is weak, it indicates a deficiency of spleen energy and affects the ability to rest comfortably. &quot;Jie&quot; refers to lethargy. If the flesh is depleted, the body is weakened. The interplay of cold and heat suggests a deficiency in yin, yang, blood, and qi. Yang deficiency leads to aversion to cold, while yin deficiency causes heat. The balance of yin and yang, as well as form and energy, all suffer from depletion and thus result in untreatable conditions. Like the scales of a withered fish, where the skin shows signs of coldness and bumps. Cold represents the energy of water, which adversely affects the internal environment, resulting in cold symptoms externally. In cases of warm diseases, cold toxins are stored in the skin, manifesting as warm disease in the spring; hence, if the skin feels hot and the pulse is strong and dry, one can infer the presence of warm disease. A strong and slippery pulse indicates that the illness is also emerging from the exterior. If the wrist skin is cold and the pulse is small, it signifies a lack of qi. Qi is what warms the skin and fleshy tissues, originating from yin internally and manifesting externally, indicating internal depletion and external weakness. The wrist skin can exhibit heat followed by cold, or cold followed by heat, yet both reflect the influences of cold and heat, with the wrist governing the energies of the three yin and three yang.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on Needling and Its True Nature</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What about acupuncture? Qi Bo replied: Yin and Yang represent the changes of cold and heat. When it is hot, it nourishes rain from above; the roots and branches have little juice, the vital energy is outside, the skin is relaxed, the pores open, the blood and energy decrease, and sweat flows profusely, making the skin moist. When it is cold, the earth freezes and water turns to ice, the vital energy is internal, the skin is taut, the pores close, sweat does not flow, the blood and energy are strong, and the flesh is firm and dense. </p>
<p>To treat cold-induced disorders, one must first warm the body, harmonize the meridians, and align the palms with the armpits, elbows with the feet, and the neck with the spine to restore balance. Once the fire energy is free-flowing, the blood vessels will circulate. Then observe the condition: if the flesh is moist, needling can level it; if it is hard and tight, one must break it up and disperse it until the energy settles, which is what we call resolving blockages.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The balance of Yin and Yang in humans responds to the seasonal changes of cold and heat. In heat, the vital essence rises, leading to increased perspiration and a decrease in internal blood energy, emphasizing that human vitality stems from the essence of the lower abdomen. In cold, the freezing ground and icy water lead to internal consolidation, making the skin dense and sweat absent, thus strengthening the internal blood and energy.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat the condition, one must first warm and circulate the qi; harmonize the meridians to ensure their smooth flow. This refers to the essence and qi received from the heavens that circulates both within and outside the meridians. Adjust the hands and armpits, the elbows and feet, the neck and spine, indicating that the flow of blood and qi should be comprehensive and reach every corner. When there is excessive stagnation, it should be needled to smooth it out; when there is hardness or tightness, it should be broken apart and dispersed. This is what is meant by using needles to resolve knots.</p>
<p>As for the influence of external evils, they can provoke movement in the body, causing the fine hairs to stand and affecting the skin and pores. If they penetrate deeply and strike the bones, it leads to bone pain; if they affect the tendons, it results in tendon spasms; if they strike within the vessels, it causes blood stasis, leading to boils; if they engage the flesh and combat the defensive qi, if yang prevails, it results in heat, while if yin prevails, it results in cold. Cold causes the True Qi to retreat; when it retreats, there is emptiness, and when empty, cold attacks between the skin and muscle, causing the qi to move outward, pores to open, fine hairs to tremble, and when qi circulates, it creates itching; if it remains without moving, it results in numbness and when the defensive qi does not circulate, it leads to insensitivity.</p>
<p>Note: This discusses the harm caused by external evils to the body. Their movement can cause stagnation and spasms in skin, muscle, tendons, and bones, leading to pain or itching. The predominance of yin leads to cold, and with cold, the True Qi retreats. Injury to the defensive qi results in numbness, all of which arise from pathogenic influences.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

The throat feels dry, and the eyes weep with sour pain. A weak pulse at the Guan (gate) indicates Yang deficiency, while therein much Qi is dispersed. If in the wrist the Yin Qi is exhausted, sour pain will radiate to the skin above.</p>

<p>The five viscera and six bowels correspond internally to the bones and marrow and externally to the skin and flesh. If illness arises externally, the skin, flesh, and mouth feel tense and urgent; if illness arises internally, there will be sour pain in the bones and marrow. Thus, with Yin and Yang manifesting outside and marrow inside, the origins of the illness must be examined in detail. If the skin is deficient, it indicates cold; if the skin is solid, it indicates heat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The patient presents with intense fever yet desires clothing; the heat is on the skin, while the cold resides in the bone marrow. Zhang Zhongjing has no treatment for this. Firstly, administer Yindan decoction to clear the cold; then follow with Xiao Chaihu decoction with cinnamon to warm the exterior. Conversely, if the patient shows marked chill and does not want to approach clothing, the cold is on the skin while the heat lies in the bone marrow. Zhang Zhongjing also has no treatment for this. Initially, give Baihu decoction with ginseng to eliminate the heat; then use Cinnamon Twig and Ephedra decoction in equal parts to resolve the exterior. Generally, diseases have superficial and deep aspects, and treatment follows a sequence. For exterior heat with interior cold, the pulse must be deep and slow, the hands may feel slightly numb, and there may be diarrhea of clear fluids, which explains why even the Yin syndrome can show fever; for this, use Si Nerve or Tongmai Si Nerve decoction. For exterior cold with interior heat, the pulse must be slippery and contracted, with dryness of the mouth and tongue; thus, the Shaoyin syndrome horrible chill and curling up indicates repeated annoyance and a disinclination for thick clothing; treat with Dashaihu decoction. These are all supplementary discussions by Zhang Zhongjing.</p>
<p>As for itching, when it prompts scratching, scratching signifies fire transformation. Mild itching can also occur, but severe itching leads to rash, which is due to the skin becoming spicy and thus classified under the metal transformation. The spicy can disperse fire; hence, when metal transformation appears, the power of fire is decomposed. If a person is near fire, slight heat causes itching; excessive heat leads to pain, and proximity results in burning and sores—this is all due to fire. Itching is a beautiful ailment; hence, fire is strong in summer, and all things flourish beautifully. Some say pain is substantial, while itching is insubstantial, not because insubstantial implies cold, but because it denotes varied intensities of heat.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dryness and Cracking of the Skin</strong></p>
<p>Cracking refers to the splitting of the skin. The dry element corresponds to heaven and represents the dry metal, while the damp element corresponds to earth and represents wet soil. Heaven and earth are opposites, and dryness and dampness have different uses. Hence, dry metal emphasizes tightness and contraction, leading to tight, fine, and subtle pulses in autumn; while damp soil emphasizes relaxation and expansion, resulting in broad and long pulses in June. When the earth is damp, it is relaxed and smooth; when dry, it is tight and rough. The principle of cracking is evident. </p>
<p>Commonly, it is said that cracking is caused by wind, as wind can overcome dampness, causing dryness. The classics say that when the jueyin reaches, it is considered a wind palace and a barrier, as wind overcomes dampness leading to dryness. The saying that cold months are severe while hot months are mild is due to cold&#39;s ability to contract and close the pores, leading to dryness without sweating, hence the severity of the illness. Heat leads to relaxed skin, with open pores allowing sweat to moisten, thus the illness diminishes.</p>
<p>Some people may experience cracking in the skin due to water moisture, as moisture itself invites wind and cold. All forms of roughness and desiccation are related to dryness. Roughness and desiccation result from a depletion of fluids and energy, leading to insufficient nourishment of blood to the skin and muscle, hindering the flow of energy, hence resulting in cracking and dryness; when severe, there may be numbness and paralysis. Desiccation is characterized by a lack of water and an excess of heat. As stated in the &quot;Xici,&quot; nothing dries out all things more than fire. Therefore, when fire is extremely hot, and water is depleted, it fails to moisten the body, causing the skin to crack, with the hands and feet appearing as if deeply wounded, as though by an axe, two to three tenths deep. This condition is worse in winter and less severe in summer.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the method states that cold can contract, and contraction leads to dryness and scaly skin; heat can spread and relax, and spreading leads to nourishment and moisture, all belonging to the transformation of the dry metal element. Wang’s note says that living things are smooth and beneficial, while dead things are dry and desolate. For the purpose of treatment, one should open pathways, nourish yin and reduce yang, use cooling medicines for adjustment, ensure blood flows smoothly, and address numbness and insensitivity. Conditions of dryness, desiccation, and scaly skin should be appropriately managed, being careful not to use medicines that cause dark attachments. The classic mentions the movement of the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and the transformations brought by cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind; hence, the heavenly principles are visible, and the illnesses of the people can be understood. All diseases fall under the five elements and the six qi, adhering to the principles of overcoming strength and vulnerability. Wang’s note adds that humans, being physical, cannot be without afflictions, and once afflictions exist, there are always ways to escape from them and reconcile yin and yang.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

Those who possess should seek it, and those who do not should also seek it. The strong are held accountable, as are the weak. One must prioritize the five victories, disperse the blood and qi, allowing for smooth flow and achieving harmony—this is what is meant. </p>
<p>Dryness and desiccation are the roots of metal and the lungs. The lungs store qi, and internal damage from blood loss leads to qi deficiency; in such cases, wind can provoke cracks and eruptions. Wind overcomes dampness, and heat depletes fluids, both contributing to dryness. Therefore, the classics state that wind, heat, and fire together are yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness constitute yin. Moreover, dry and damp are different from each other. However, despite dryness being associated with autumn and yin, its nature is unlike that of cold dampness. </p>
<p>Dryness of metal, though influenced by wind and heat, is characterized by its fiery nature. Hence, when wind and heat become severe, they are akin to dryness. Furthermore, internal cold leading to vomiting or diarrhea resulting in fluid loss also causes dryness, and this is likewise addressed in the texts. Therefore, the classics state that all symptoms of withering and crackling dryness belong to the category of dryness. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart governs nourishment, and the lungs govern protection. Nourishment refers to blood. The pulse is the residence of blood and spirit. Protection is another name for the vital energy and the seven spirits, which guard the body and are located between the skin and hair. When the lungs fail, the skin and hair are the first to fail; without a place for the spirit to depend, if internal damage occurs from food and drink, one is also susceptible to wind and cold. This indicates a failure of nourishment and protection; without yang to nourish, the skin cannot withstand wind and cold. When the skin and hair fail, the source of the heart and lungs is also lost. If the stomach&#39;s energy does not rise, vital energy does not generate; without nourishment for the heart and lungs, this leads to deficiency.</p>
<p>Dryness</p>
<p>The large intestine is associated with the metal element and dryness, governing fluid. The small intestine is associated with the fire element and heat, governing liquid. Both are related to the stomach.

<p>When the skin is dry and itchy, the text states: all itching arises from deficiency, as the blood does not nourish the skin. One should use tonifying herbs to nourish yin and blood, harmonizing the blood and moistening the muscles, causing the itch to cease.</p>

<p><strong>Cracking and Peeling</strong><br>Danxi said: When the skin cracks and peels, leading to blood loss and severe pain, or if the skin is dry and itchy, it is due to fire damaging the lung&#39;s metal element, causing excessive dryness. It is advisable to use the Four Substance Decoction with Chuanxiong, adding ingredients like Mai Men Dong, Ren Shen, Tian Hua Fen, Huang Bo, and Wu Wei Zi to treat it.</p>
<p><strong>Key Treatment Principles</strong><br><strong>(Ming: Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Itching</strong><br>In the summer months, if the body itches as if pricked by needles, with some areas becoming red and swollen, it is also known as summer wind, affecting the finer hairs. If vital energy is deficient, the skin and hair become scorched, leading to a loss of body fluids. If the skin is entirely compromised, with the fluids having been depleted, the claws become brittle, and hair breaks off. Broken hair means that the hair has died first.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with Heart Fire</strong><br>Skin pain is linked to excess heart energy. The classics say: The summer pulse relates to the heart; excessive summer pulse results in bodily heat and skin pain from immersion. Skin pain resulting from qi stagnation is attributed to fire evil harming the lungs. The classics state that when the Shaoyin is at the spring, heat excess prevails, causing cold and heat-related skin pain. Furthermore, it says that Shaoyin controls heaven; when fire excess prevails, skin pain arises. It also states that when the Shaoyin recurs, there may be coughing and skin pain, which should be treated with various cooling remedies.</p>
<p><strong>Itching Due to Blood Deficiency</strong><br>The classics mention that all itching is caused by deficiency. When blood does not nourish the skin and pores, itching occurs. One should use nourishing medicines to support yin blood, harmonizing the blood and moisturizing the skin, thus preventing itching.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Dryness of the Skin</h3>
<p>The skin being dry, as referred to by Zhang Zhongjing as &quot;the skin being rough and parched,&quot; indicates skin that is not smooth or moist. When the skin is dry due to internal dryness damaging the gallbladder&#39;s energy, it is stated that the Yangming channel is affected; dryness prevails, leading to a condition where the body lacks moisture. Therefore, it should be treated with bitter and cold remedies.</p>
<h3>Cracking</h3>
<p>The scriptures state: All instances of roughness and dryness, as well as cracking, are attributable to dryness. When dry qi resides internally, it consumes bodily fluids, causing constipation and thirst, while the blood vessels dry up and energy becomes stagnant. This can result from overindulgence in spicy and rich foods, which exacerbates fire evils, lying dormant within the blood and depleting true yin, leading to a deficiency in fluids and occasional dryness; or from wind dryness on the surface, affecting the skin, resulting in rough, dry, itchy hair and strong, tense nails, difficulty in opening the mouth, accompanied by coldness and spasms of the muscles, excessive saliva in the chest, and dry syndromes such as mental confusion and rigidity—all stemming from a deficiency of yin blood that cannot restrain fire; when fire burns fiercely, it overcomes metal, and when metal is affected by evil, it cannot control wood, causing the liver qi to become excessively strong, leading to the internal generation of wind evils and resulting in these ailments. </p>
<p>The methods for treatment are to use warming spices to moisten, bitter herbs to drain, nourish yin and blood for those who are deficient; to drain fire and soften hardness for those suffering from fire; and to dispel wind and resolve stagnation for those affected by wind. These three strategies are the principal methods for treating conditions of dryness.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Lungs Correspond to Skin</strong></p>
<p>When any of the five organs is deficient, symptoms will manifest externally. The lungs govern qi and control the skin and hair. If the lungs are deficient, the complexion becomes pale, there is excessive sweating, and breath becomes labored. To replenish its flow and restore its source is indeed skillful treatment. A deficiency in the lungs leads to scorched skin and hair, a depletion of fluids, weakness, abdominal distension, and breathlessness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles</strong><br><strong>Ming - Xu Chunfu</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Itching and Dryness</strong>  </p>
<p>For itching caused by stagnant heat in the skin, it is advisable to clear heat, disperse wind, and cool the blood, with the method of harmony being excellent. The classics say: all itching arises from deficiency. The lungs govern Qi and control the skin and hair; when Lung Qi is obstructed and leads to itching, it is necessary to ward off wind and supplement with ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes. When the defensive Yang is firm, leading to closed and stagnant heat, and when the defensive Qi is disharmonious, one should adjust Qi and harmonize blood to dispel stagnation. Liu Hejian differentiates between constipation or thirst, recognizing them as internal manifestations of dryness; when the body is hot, skin is dry, and conditions like dry scabies and rough skin exist, these reflect external manifestations of dryness. In cases of Yang and Yin stagnation, and when Qi and blood are deficient and stagnated, wind and heat can be diagnosed accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>Ming - Wang Kentang</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Numbness</strong>  </p>
<p>If there is numbness between the skin, this is due to the stagnation of Lung Qi; thus, the prescription of Shao Yao Bu Qi Decoction is recommended. If wind and dampness invade the kidney channel, leading to blood stasis, with swelling and pain in the lower back, inability to turn or shift, numbness in the skin, generalized numbness, swelling in the neck and head, frequent ringing in the ears, low pain and weakness in the legs and knees, difficulty in walking, and stiffness in the neck and back preventing relaxation, one should use the Blood Activating Pain Relief Pill.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Text of the Stone Chamber</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sound of Insects Beneath the Skin</strong></p>
<p>When a person has sounds beneath the skin, particularly between the hands and feet, resembling singing from an earthworm, this indicates that moisture has given rise to insects. One should apply earthworm dung to the affected area; when the sound ceases, then mix with water and apply a thick layer about an inch deep. When the sound stops, brew a decoction. Use five qian each of Atractylodes and Saposhnikovia, one liang each of Job&#39;s tears and water chestnut, three qian of raw licorice, two qian of scutellaria, and three fen of aconite; boil with water and take it to achieve healing. This treatment eliminates the moisture that nourishes the insects, especially with raw licorice to detoxify and transform the insects, and with Saposhnikovia to expel wind and eliminate stasis, while aconite destroys barriers and expels evil, thus achieving miraculous results.</p>
<p><strong>Cracks</strong></p>
<p>If there seems to be something moving in the throat, coughing up phlegm worsens the pain, and the skin on the body cracks with fluid leaking out; the eyes become red and swollen but are not painful, and the feet swell like pots but can still be used; this is a truly rare affliction. It is caused by eating raw vegetables that had centipedes on the leaves, without realizing it, leading to centipedes arising in the stomach. When they enter the stomach, it causes pain, and if they rise to the throat, it causes throat pain, worsening with hunger. Take a whole chicken, cook it until done, season with five spices to create an enticing aroma, and place it near the patient as they sleep; the centipedes will naturally crawl out. Should any centipedes emerge, catch them immediately, preventing them from re-entering the mouth. Whether one or several come out, getting them all out leads to recovery. Generally, if there is no movement in the throat, there are no centipedes present.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

Decoction in water for ten doses will heal the cracked skin, and the swelling of the feet will also diminish. The centipede resides in the upper cavity; no medicine can kill it. If the medicine goes down the throat, it reaches the stomach, but the centipede remains above the stomach, so it cannot be killed. Thus, it is necessary to draw it out, and then treat the qi and blood with medicine to facilitate healing. Cracked skin occurs because the centipede&#39;s toxic gas lingers near the lungs, which govern the skin and hair, hence the skin cracks. The swelling of the feet corresponds to the kidneys; the lungs are situated above and are considered the mother of the kidneys. When the mother is ill, the child also suffers. However, the kidney water is ultimately not deficient, but the toxic gas lingers in the kidney region, causing the skin of the feet to be swollen and tense, not a bone disease. Thus, they can still walk. The eyes are associated with the liver, which is affected by the toxic qi from the lungs, resulting in redness and swelling.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Steaming with Caltrops</strong></p>
<p>To treat the deficiency of the skin and to address the cold air obstructing the large intestine, take one斗 of fine bran, and cut three升 of caltrop roots and leaves, two升 each of sliced calamus leaves and peach leaf branches, and five升 of glutinous rice. Combine these five ingredients and cook them in 1石 and 5斗 of water until the rice is fully cooked. Store this in a large basin, then create a small bamboo bed to cover the basin, with a person sitting on the bed in the middle. Surround the area with matting to block the wind, and cover the body with clothing and blankets. When breathing occurs, create an opening in the middle to release the steam; this can help the whole body to sweat profusely, possibly for two meals&#39; duration. Repeat this for three days, steaming with the warm medicine and allowing for good sweating. If the basin is not hot enough, place charcoal fire underneath. This method is effective not only for treating cold but also for addressing all labor-induced coolness in the skin.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>&quot;The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: When illness is in the hair and pores, needling the hair does not harm the skin; if the skin is harmed, it affects the lungs, and if the lungs are affected, it causes autumn illnesses and chills from cold. The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a method to needle the six organs? Qibo replied: To needle here, one must hit the qi points. You must not touch the flesh knots; if you hit the qi points, the needle travels through the channels, but pain will be felt in the flesh knots. Supplementing and draining improperly will worsen the illness. If targeting the tendons, relax the tendons so that the evil qi does not escape. Instead of dispersing it outside, it remains inside. Not using the needle correctly, following the wrong principles leads to reversed outcomes. Cold qi resides in the skin, with a predominance of yin and deficiency of yang, causing chills and trembling; thus, one must supplement all yang. For diseases located in inconsistent areas of the skin, use a perforating needle at the affected site, avoiding areas that are too pale. </p>
<p>When using a straight needle, pull the skin taut before piercing; this treats superficial cold. The so-called three punctures to release the qi involves first superficially piercing to release the yang evil, then needling again to bring out the yin evil, going deeper to avoid the muscle without penetrating into the layers of flesh.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

For half-needling, it penetrates shallowly and swiftly, without piercing the flesh, resembling the act of plucking hair to draw out the qi of the skin; this corresponds to the lung. In hot illnesses, there may be initial skin pain, nasal congestion, and facial fullness; treat the skin with the first needle, number fifty-nine.

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one discern a disease of the skin? Bo Gao replied: When there is a color appearing between the two eyebrows that is thin and glossy, the disease is in the skin. The skin has sections, and these sections distribute to the four extremities. The Yellow Emperor asked: How should one treat it? Bo Gao replied: Diseases vary widely; they rise and fall, are deep or shallow, and cannot be exhausted. Each is in its place: the shallow ones are treated lightly, the severe ones more deeply, the intermediate ones minimally, and the severe ones with more intensity, adjusting the qi according to changes; hence it is said to be the work of a master.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Swelling and a distended abdomen caused by water retention, with water in the skin, is treated at the Shimen point. When the body is swollen and the skin feels so sensitive that it cannot touch clothing, accompanied by severe itching and eventual numbness, it is treated at the Wu Yi point. The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: skin pain is addressed by the lungs. The classics say that if the evil is in the lungs, the skin will hurt, along with symptoms of chills, heat, shortness of breath, sweating, and coughing affecting the shoulders and back. This is treated by pressure on the chest and sides of the back, followed by needling, with additional treatment at the Xuan point. When the skin feels rough and dry, one should treat the foot Shaoyang channel. The classics say that the channel of foot Shaoyang, when activated, indicates the body lacks moisture. This can be assessed based on the presence of excess heat or cold sinking downward. If one is affected by autumn wind, cold, and dampness, it leads to skin bi syndrome. If it persists, it will enter the lungs, causing symptoms like anxiety, fullness, shortness of breath, and vomiting, which can be treated at the Taiyuan and Hegu points. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Treatise&quot; states that Zhi Yin and Wu Yi treat generalized skin itching.</p>

First, apply an external method, using heat at the tailbone while pressing and rubbing it with fingers until moisture resembling sweat emerges, leading to recovery. Next, stimulate the upper chest and expel phlegm, placing the hand over the abdomen and imagining the heat circulating to burn it within.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Health Treasure&quot; states: The Deputy Envoy of the State, Lord Tan, aged forty-nine, during the spring of the year of Bingyin in the Yuan dynasty, suffered from cold pain in the navel and abdomen, undigested food, cold and reverse sensitivity in the ankles, numbness in the skin, weakened spirit, and fatigue. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be deep, thin, and weak. He was then treated with a large dose of hot, sweet, and spicy medicine; and moxibustion was applied at Qihai and Sānli points with three seven-sticks each, and two seven-sticks at Yangfu each. However, after several days, there was still no significant change, and after ten days, the sores did not produce pus, with the wound edges remaining dry. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the year of Guichou, I was assigned to the winter camp at Guahudu and learned acupuncture from Mr. Dou Zisheng. I inquired about acupuncture points and was told: &quot;For acupuncture, if the Qi does not reach the point, it will not be effective, and the moxibustion will also fail. Generally, this is because the underlying Qi is deficient and cannot produce pus, thereby losing its nourishment.&quot; If care is not taken further, the evil Qi will increase, causing the illness to persist. Another day I conveyed this to the acupuncture and moxibustion experts, who also concurred. </p>
<p>In the spring of the year of Wuchan, the Deputy Envoy was appointed as the magistrate of Yidu Prefecture. Shortly after taking office, he developed wind illness, leading to numbness in half of his body, spontaneous sweating, intolerance to wind, unwarranted joy and laughter, increased forgetfulness, and slurred speech. The doctor administered a Sustaining Life Decoction, which caused his sweating to recur, and the fluid loss became worse. He then sought medical attention and returned home; over time, his spirit became muddled, his appearance emaciated, he lost taste in food, and had accidents with urination and defecation. He needed assistance to rise and tried various doctors and medicines, all to no avail. </p>
<p>He then recalled the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; stating: &quot;Yang Qi is like the heavens and the sun; if lost from its place, it leads to a shortened life and lack of vitality.&quot;<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now, because of this illness, I understand the words of Master Sheng. Some say: &quot;The deputy&#39;s enjoyment lies in rich food and comfort for the body, provisions at hand for matters ahead, and he finds everything satisfactory. Why does the ruler say he has lost his nourishment?&quot; I reply: &quot;Your words refer to nourishment for the mouth and body. I speak of nourishment for life and essence.&quot; Furthermore, the Qian family, in their prime, gained success but did not comprehend the correct way to nourish themselves. They sought to satisfy their hearts, leading to a dissipated spirit, depleted energy, and resulting in this illness. The &quot;Spinal Classic&quot; states: At ten years old, the five organs begin to stabilize, and blood and energy flow; hence, one enjoys running. At twenty, blood and energy begin to flourish, muscles grow, and one enjoys walking briskly. At thirty, the five organs are well-established, muscles are firm, and blood and energy are abundant; thus, one enjoys walking. At forty, the organs, bowels, and twelve channels are all flourishing and balanced, pores begin to relax, and hair loses its luster, turning gray; steadiness prevails, and one enjoys sitting. At fifty, liver energy begins to decline, the liver becomes thin, bile diminishes, and vision starts to fail. At sixty, heart energy declines, one is prone to worry and sorrow, and blood and energy become sluggish; hence, one enjoys resting. At seventy, spleen energy begins to weaken, and skin becomes dry. At eighty, lung energy declines, the soul becomes scattered, and one speaks softly. At ninety, kidney energy is exhausted, organs wither, and channels become empty. At one hundred, all five organs are weakened, spirit and energy depart, and the body remains alone until the end. Thus, spirit is limited, while desires are endless, leading to the loss of life essence; once lost, it is hard to regain. Is this not the fate of the Qian family?<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhang Zijing, the Provincial Physician, was sixty-seven years old, suffering from dim vision, slightly dark lips, and dull skin. His pulse was thin and weak. One day, he presented two prescriptions for treating his eyes and asked if he could take them. I replied: These medicines are based on extremely bitter huanglian as the main ingredient, with wind-dispelling herbs as assistants. Since the age of fifty, one&#39;s bile diminishes, leading to loss of sight. The Inner Canon states that the earth element governs and is purged by bitterness, and all wind-dispelling herbs also purge the earth. At seventy, one’s spleen and stomach become weak, leading to dry skin. Excessive purging of the earth will further deplete the spleen and stomach&#39;s energy, hindering its ability to nourish the vital energy, causing gastric energy not to ascend and creating ailments such as reflux and food rejection. Additionally, at an advanced age, one&#39;s daily routines are different. This medicine should not be taken; it is more advisable to be cautious with speech, moderate eating, and restrain anger and desires—this is a kind of treatment without medication. Zijing agreed with my assessment. The following spring, he retired from his position as inspector of the northwest and returned home, feeling clear-headed and his pulse became steady. This is the effect of not recklessly taking cold medicine. The Inner Canon says: Punishments without excess are termed great enlightenment; one may resolve them.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

If there is vomiting, there is a reversal of qi, which causes the face to turn red. If qi does not reverse, there will be blockage in the upper and lower parts, and without passage, the face will turn black, with the skin and hair becoming scorched, leading to a fatal outcome. **Notes:** The foot Taiyin pulse enters the abdomen and is associated with the spleen, thus causing abdominal distension. The hand Taiyin pulse rises to the diaphragm, is related to the lungs, and governs respiration, hence the inability to breathe. When there is fullness, ascent and descent are difficult; when there is an inability to breathe, it indicates stagnation of qi. Belching leads to qi rising upwards, which causes a red face; if qi does not reverse, there is internal blockage, leading to a lack of passage between the upper and lower parts. When the spleen qi is deficient, it cannot control fluids, which is why the face turns black. When lung qi is deficient, the body does not function properly, resulting in dryness of skin and hair. **Discussion on the Meridians** The flow of pulse qi travels through the meridians, and the essence of meridian qi returns to the lungs, with the lungs connecting to all hundred vessels, distributing essence to the skin and hair. **Notes:** Pulse qi consists of the essence of food and water that flows through the meridians. It refers to the qi of the food entering the stomach, first activating the qi in the vessels. The essence of the hundred vessels ultimately returns to the main meridian, and since the essence of the meridian returns to the lungs, all vessel qi converges in the lungs. The lungs connect with the skin and hair, thus distributing essence to them as well."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Bi Syndrome** The Yellow Emperor asked: What is the cause of the Bi syndrome? Qi Bo replied: It arises from the mingling of the three qi: wind, cold, and damp, which combine to become Bi. When this occurs in autumn, it manifests as skin Bi. Therefore, when bone Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the kidneys; when muscle Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the liver; when pulse Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the heart; when flesh Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the spleen; when skin Bi persists, it is continually affected by malevolent factors and resides internally in the lungs. Thus, the so-called Bi in each case arises from a strong external influence of wind, cold, and damp at that time. **Note:** Bi means blockage, and the malevolent factors block and cause pain. The description indicates that the three qi of wind, cold, and damp arrive mixed, creating Bi. The skin, flesh, muscles, and bones are related to the five organs, and the qi of the five organs corresponds externally to the four seasons. The initial manifestation occurs externally as a form, which then injures the internal five qi; the combination of external and internal influences leads to the blockage within. The Emperor said: Some cases of Bi lead to death, some cause prolonged pain, and some are easily resolved; what are the reasons for this? Qi Bo said: Those that invade the organs lead to death; those that linger between muscle and bone cause prolonged pain; those that remain within the skin are easily resolved. **Note:** If the wind, cold, and damp penetrate the points, and the organ qi is strong, then the malevolent factor does not affect the organs. When the spirit and qi deplete, the Bi gathers in the organs and causes death. If it lingers between muscle and bone without affecting the organs, it causes prolonged pain. If it remains within the skin, it disperses easily with the qi."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"If it affects the pulse, then it internally connects to the five organs. Moreover, if the yin energy does not accumulate, the pathogenic factors directly enter the organs, resulting in incurable death. The Emperor said: Good. Why do blockages sometimes cause pain, sometimes not, sometimes numbness, sometimes cold or heat, sometimes dryness or dampness? Qi Bo replied: Pain occurs because of excessive cold; thus, there is pain from the presence of cold. Those that do not feel pain or numbness are due to long-term illness infiltrating deeply, causing the regulation of vital substances to be obstructed and the meridians to be intermittently blocked, hence the lack of flow. The skin does not receive nourishment, resulting in numbness."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"When a邪病 persists for a long time, the pathways of nourishment and defense become injured and flow weakly. If the邪 enters deeply, it does not cause blockage in the physical body but results in a temporary looseness in the meridians, hence there is no pain. When the pathways of nourishment and defense are weak, they cannot nourish the skin, leading to insensitivity. The Emperor asked: In the case of bi syndrome, why is there no pain? Qibo replied: When bi affects the bones, it feels heavy; when it affects the vessels, the blood stagnates and does not flow; when it affects the tendons, they cannot bend or extend; when it affects the flesh, there is insensitivity; when it affects the skin, it feels cold. Therefore, possessing these five conditions results in no pain. Note: Bones have bone qi, vessels have vessel qi, tendons have tendon qi, flesh has flesh qi, and skin has skin qi, all of which correspond to the qi of the five organs and integrate with the physical body. If the body is affected but its qi is not injured, one only observes the heaviness of bone bi, the stagnation of blood in vessel bi, the inability to bend or extend in tendon bi, the insensitivity of flesh bi, and the coldness of skin bi. Hence, possessing these five physical symptoms results in no pain."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"**On the Skin and Its Diseases** The Yellow Emperor asked: I have heard that the skin has divisions, the vessels have pathways, the tendons have connections, and the bones have measurements, with each giving rise to different diseases. Please differentiate their divisions, left and right, up and down, the yin and yang locations, and the beginning and end of the diseases. I wish to know this principle. Qibo replied: To understand the skin, we should regard the meridians as the framework; all meridians are like this. The yangming of the yang is called \"Hɑi Fei,\" following the same principle up and down. Looking at its section, if there are superficial connections, they all belong to the yangming connections. If the color is mostly blue, it indicates pain; if black, it indicates blockage; if yellow or red, it indicates heat; if white, it indicates cold; if all five colors are present, it indicates both cold and heat. If the connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. The yang governs the outer, while the yin governs the inner. The shaoyang of the yang is called \"Shu Chi,\" which also follows the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections in this section, they all belong to the shaoyang connections. If the connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians; thus, those in the yang govern the inner, while those in the yin govern the outer, allowing for infiltration into the inner; all meridians follow this principle. The taiyang of the yang is called \"Guan Shu,\" which again follows the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections here, they all belong to the taiyang connections. When connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. The shaoyin of the yin is called \"Shu Ru,\" also following the same principle up and down. If there are superficial connections in this section, they all belong to the shaoyin connections. When connections are abundant, they become guests in the meridians. Their entry into the meridians is through the yang section entering into the meridian; their exit is from the yin interior into the bones.

Observing its parts, those with floating collaterals are all associated with the Taiyin's collaterals. When the collaterals are abundant, they lead pathogens into the meridians. All twelve meridians are connected to the skin. Thus, the onset of all diseases must begin with the skin and hair; when pathogens penetrate, the pores open, and when opened, they allow pathogens to enter the collaterals, lingering and not departing, transferring into the meridians and lingering there, passing into the organs and accumulating in the intestines and stomach."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"When邪 (pathogenic factors) first enters the skin, it causes a sudden rise of fine hairs and opens the pores; when it enters the vessels, the channels become engorged and discolored; when it invades the meridians, one feels weakness and descends into discomfort; if it lingers between muscles and bones, excessive cold causes muscle cramps and bone pain, while excessive heat leads to relaxation of the muscles and depletion of the bones, resulting in flesh being broken down and hair becoming brittle and falling out. The Emperor said: \"In your discussion of the twelve divisions of the skin, how do these lead to illness?\" Qi Bo replied: \"The skin is part of the channels; when邪 enters the skin, it opens the pores, allowing邪 to invade the vessels. When the vessels are full, it flows into the meridians, and when the meridians are full, it settles into the organs. Therefore, the skin divides into sections; if邪 does not enter, it can lead to major illness.\" The Emperor said: \"Good.\" [Note: This section discusses the twelve meridian channels, explaining how illness begins at the skin, enters the vessels, and proceeds through the channels to affect the organs.

Hernias indicate an issue in Qi, while blood issues pertain to blood. The autumnal climate affects the skin; autumn marks the beginning of the gathering of atmospheric energy, leading to closed pores and tense skin.) ### Discussion on Governance Principles The Greater Yang governs the heavens; cold air descends, heart Qi ascends, and fire becomes evident, soil becomes moist, and water becomes abundant. As the cold guest arrives, the heavy Yin transforms into moisture; energies change substances. When water fills the interior, leading to saturation and inability to eat, skin and muscle become afflicted, and tendons and vessels are impeded. In severe cases, this results in swellings and carbuncles on the back.

There are chills and fevers, skin pain, closed eyes, and toothaches, swelling, and chills accompanied by fever resembling malaria. There is pain in the lower abdomen, an enlarged belly, and insects do not hide. (Note: The Lesser Yin in spring refers to the year of the Rabbit and the Rooster. The fire of the Lesser Yin generates in the water, hence the flames rise over rivers and marshes. The Lesser Yin indicates shadow and fundamentally fire, thus the shadow appears bright. The constant rumbling in the abdomen signifies the bustling fire energy. The energy surging up to the chest indicates the fiery energy rising. Wheezing and inability to stand for long, along with chills and skin pain, result from the fire overpowering the lungs. Closed eyes signify extreme heat with Yin deficiency, causing aversion to sunlight. Toothaches and swelling occur due to heat overwhelming the Yang Ming. Fevers resembling malaria are due to the illness of the foundational energy of the Lesser Yin. Heat in the lower region causes pain in the lower abdomen, and heat in the middle region causes stomach distension.) The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when overwhelmed by heat, the oppressive heat arrives, and the fire carries out its governance.

In the Lesser Yang, when Fire overpowers, warmth spreads. If metal governance is unbalanced, the people suffer from headaches, fever, chills, and malaria, skin pain from heat, complexion turning yellow and red, evolving into water disturbances, swelling in the body and face, fullness in the abdomen, difficult breathing, diarrhea with red and white discharge, sores, coughing up blood, irritability, and heat in the chest, and in severe cases, nosebleeds, with the illness originating in the lungs. If the heavenly treasury ends, it leads to death without treatment. Note: The Lesser Yang commands the heavens, particularly in the years of the Tiger and Monkey. The domination of fire leads to the imbalance of metal governance. The fire in the Lesser Yang, prevailing in the heavens, causes summer heat, hence the people suffer from headaches, chills, malaria, skin heat, and color change. The water transmit back as it challenges the overflow of metal and water, resulting in swelling from water disease, leading to difficult breathing, with lung energy reversing, preventing rest.

If all five organs are weak, then fluids are exhausted and susceptibility to consumption increases. The body is an outward manifestation of the five organs; with thin skin and weak muscles, the five organs must be weak as well. Softness implies the necessity of strength; thus, if a person has thin skin but deep-set, firm eyes, their qi has the potential for vigorous upward movement. Their heart is strong, and with this strength comes frequent anger, which causes a rebellious rise of qi and results in an accumulation of blood in the chest.

The dry element corresponds to heaven and represents the dry metal, while the damp element corresponds to earth and represents wet soil.

Hence, dry metal emphasizes tightness and contraction, leading to tight, fine, and subtle pulses in autumn; while damp soil emphasizes relaxation and expansion, resulting in broad and long pulses in June. When the earth is damp, it is relaxed and smooth; when dry, it is tight and rough. The principle of cracking is evident. Commonly, it is said that cracking is caused by wind, as wind can overcome dampness, causing dryness. The classics say that when the jueyin reaches, it is considered a wind palace and a barrier, as wind overcomes dampness leading to dryness. The saying that cold months are severe while hot months are mild is due to cold's ability to contract and close the pores, leading to dryness without sweating, hence the severity of the illness. Heat leads to relaxed skin, with open pores allowing sweat to moisten, thus the illness diminishes. Some people may experience cracking in the skin due to water moisture, as moisture itself invites wind and cold. All forms of roughness and desiccation are related to dryness. Roughness and desiccation result from a depletion of fluids and energy, leading to insufficient nourishment of blood to the skin and muscle, hindering the flow of energy, hence resulting in cracking and dryness; when severe, there may be numbness and paralysis. Desiccation is characterized by a lack of water and an excess of heat. As stated in the \"Xici,\" nothing dries out all things more than fire. Therefore, when fire is extremely hot, and water is depleted, it fails to moisten the body, causing the skin to crack, with the hands and feet appearing as if deeply wounded, as though by an axe, two to three tenths deep.

However, despite dryness being associated with autumn and yin, its nature is unlike that of cold dampness. Dryness of metal, though influenced by wind and heat, is characterized by its fiery nature. Hence, when wind and heat become severe, they are akin to dryness.

The Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a method to needle the six organs? Qibo replied: To needle here, one must hit the qi points. You must not touch the flesh knots; if you hit the qi points, the needle travels through the channels, but pain will be felt in the flesh knots. Supplementing and draining improperly will worsen the illness. If targeting the tendons, relax the tendons so that the evil qi does not escape. Instead of dispersing it outside, it remains inside. Not using the needle correctly, following the wrong principles leads to reversed outcomes. Cold qi resides in the skin, with a predominance of yin and deficiency of yang, causing chills and trembling; thus, one must supplement all yang. For diseases located in inconsistent areas of the skin, use a perforating needle at the affected site, avoiding areas that are too pale. When using a straight needle, pull the skin taut before piercing; this treats superficial cold. The so-called three punctures to release the qi involves first superficially piercing to release the yang evil, then needling again to bring out the yin evil, going deeper to avoid the muscle without penetrating into the layers of flesh."},{"anchor":"trans-52p","marker":"52p","type":"translation","text":"Once one has entered the realm of flesh, the qi of grain is released.

In hot illnesses, there may be initial skin pain, nasal congestion, and facial fullness; treat the skin with the first needle, number fifty-nine. If the nose is obstructed and the skin is affected by the lung, do not seek the qi of fire, for fire corresponds to the heart. The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How can one discern a disease of the skin? Bo Gao replied: When there is a color appearing between the two eyebrows that is thin and glossy, the disease is in the skin. The skin has sections, and these sections distribute to the four extremities. The Yellow Emperor asked: How should one treat it? Bo Gao replied: Diseases vary widely; they rise and fall, are deep or shallow, and cannot be exhausted. Each is in its place: the shallow ones are treated lightly, the severe ones more deeply, the intermediate ones minimally, and the severe ones with more intensity, adjusting the qi according to changes; hence it is said to be the work of a master. For wind (or pathological water) causing skin swelling, it constitutes fifty-seven ailments; draw blood from the skin thoroughly. In cases of cold and heat in the skin, one cannot lie on the mat, hair scorches, the nose is dry and waxy, and sweating cannot be achieved; one should use the three yang channels to supplement the hand's taiyin.

Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be deep, thin, and weak. He was then treated with a large dose of hot, sweet, and spicy medicine; and moxibustion was applied at Qihai and Sānli points with three seven-sticks each, and two seven-sticks at Yangfu each. However, after several days, there was still no significant change, and after ten days, the sores did not produce pus, with the wound edges remaining dry. At the beginning of the year of Guichou, I was assigned to the winter camp at Guahudu and learned acupuncture from Mr. Dou Zisheng. I inquired about acupuncture points and was told: \"For acupuncture, if the Qi does not reach the point, it will not be effective, and the moxibustion will also fail. Generally, this is because the underlying Qi is deficient and cannot produce pus, thereby losing its nourishment.\" If care is not taken further, the evil Qi will increase, causing the illness to persist. Another day I conveyed this to the acupuncture and moxibustion experts, who also concurred. In the spring of the year of Wuchan, the Deputy Envoy was appointed as the magistrate of Yidu Prefecture. Shortly after taking office, he developed wind illness, leading to numbness in half of his body, spontaneous sweating, intolerance to wind, unwarranted joy and laughter, increased forgetfulness, and slurred speech. The doctor administered a Sustaining Life Decoction, which caused his sweating to recur, and the fluid loss became worse. He then sought medical attention and returned home; over time, his spirit became muddled, his appearance emaciated, he lost taste in food, and had accidents with urination and defecation. He needed assistance to rise and tried various doctors and medicines, all to no avail. He then recalled the \"Inner Canon\" stating: \"Yang Qi is like the heavens and the sun; if lost from its place, it leads to a shortened life and lack of vitality.\""},{"anchor":"trans-56p","marker":"56p","type":"translation","text":"Now, because of this illness, I understand the words of Master Sheng.

Excessive purging of the earth will further deplete the spleen and stomach's energy, hindering its ability to nourish the vital energy, causing gastric energy not to ascend and creating ailments such as reflux and food rejection. Additionally, at an advanced age, one's daily routines are different. This medicine should not be taken; it is more advisable to be cautious with speech, moderate eating, and restrain anger and desires—this is a kind of treatment without medication. Zijing agreed with my assessment. The following spring, he retired from his position as inspector of the northwest and returned home, feeling clear-headed and his pulse became steady. This is the effect of not recklessly taking cold medicine.
