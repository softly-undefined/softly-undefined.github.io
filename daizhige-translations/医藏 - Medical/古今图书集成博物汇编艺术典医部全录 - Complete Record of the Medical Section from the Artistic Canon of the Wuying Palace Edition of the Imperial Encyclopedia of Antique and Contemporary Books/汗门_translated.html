<p><strong>Sweat Points</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Differentiation of Meridians</strong></p>
<p>Excessive eating and drinking leads to sweating from the stomach. Startlement depletes the essence, resulting in sweating from the heart. Carrying heavy loads while traveling long distances causes sweating from the kidneys. Running in fear leads to sweating from the liver. Physical exhaustion results in sweating from the spleen. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Sweat is the fluid derived from food and drink; when one is overfull, the stomach is distended, resulting in sweating from the stomach. Blood is the essence of the heart, and sweat is the fluid of blood; when startled, it harms the heart&#39;s energy, hence it is said to deplete essence. The kidneys govern the bones; carrying heavy loads injures the bones, thus causing sweating from the kidneys. The liver governs the tendons; fatigue injures the tendons, leading to sweating from the liver. Labor harms the entire body, thus causing sweating from the spleen.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Yang added to Yin is called sweat.<br>[Note: Sweat is the fluid of Yin, derived from the expulsion of Yang energy, which then nourishes the body and moistens the hair. When Yang meridians are activated and added to the wrist area, this is referred to as sweat.]</p>
<p><strong>Regulations of Organs and Their Correspondence</strong></p>
<p>In cases of lung disease, there are symptoms of wheezing, coughing, reversed qi, pain in the shoulders and back, and sweating.<br>[Note: The lungs govern qi and originate from the kidneys; thus, the qi of the mother and child channels are interconnected. Therefore, when qi is reversed, it leads to wheezing, coughing, shoulder and back pain, and sweating.] </p>
<p>For kidney disease, there is night sweating and aversion to wind.<br>[Note: The energy of the sun oversees the surface and descends through the bladder channel; when the qi reverses, the superficial energy becomes deficient, leading to night sweats and aversion to wind.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Bi Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>When wind, cold, and dampness converge, they combine to form Bi syndrome. This is more pronounced in cases with excessive sweating and dampness. When Yang energy is deficient and Yin energy is excessive, the two energies interact, resulting in sweating and dampness.<br>[Note: The interaction of the yin and cold energy of nature with the excessive Yin energy within the body causes sweating and dampness.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The reason why people sweat is all derived from grain, and grain is born from essence. [Note: Sweat comes from the essence of water and grain, and this essence transforms from the vital energy.] When evil Qi contends within the flesh and bones and results in sweat, it indicates that the evil is expelled and the essence prevails. [Note: Contending within the flesh and bones means that the evil Qi lies hidden between them, and in spring, it struggles against the righteous Qi, manifesting as warm disease. If sweat is produced, it means that the vital energy has triumphed and the evil is combined with it and expelled.] The reoccurrence of heat signifies evil Qi. Sweat is the vital energy. Now, if sweat appears but there is still a recurrence of heat, then the evil has prevailed. If sweat occurs and the pulse remains agitated and strong, death is imminent. If the pulse does not correspond with the sweat, this indicates an inability to overcome the disease, and death is evidently near. [Note: If sweat is produced but the evil remains, it will cause further harm to the Yin essence. In cases of heat disease where sweat has been achieved but the pulse remains agitated, it indicates the extremity of Yin pulse, leading to death.] Those with Yin deficiency will certainly have Yang surging, hence they sweat when they experience little Qi and heat. [Note: When Yin is deficient, Yang tends to overpower it, resulting in sweating.] If sweat emerges with body heat, it signifies wind; if sweat emerges with frustration and fullness that does not resolve, it signifies counterflow; this condition is called wind counterflow. [Note: Wind represents Yang evil, which opens the skin and causes fluid to leak outward; the retention of wind heat results in body heat. If the wind heat does not dissipate, it harms the kidneys, causing Qi to counterflow upwards leading to heart vexation, while overwhelming the spleen earth leads to fullness; this condition is termed wind counterflow, signifying that it reverses the Qi of the kidneys due to wind evil.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>On the Essentials of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>When the lung pulse is soft and scattered, it indicates the illness of profuse sweating, to the point where it cannot return to dispersing. <strong>[Note: Profuse sweating refers to the sweating that floods the flesh and skin from the spleen&#39;s earth.] When the lung qi is deficient and cannot distribute the fluids, the spleen qi floods into the skin, causing the lung qi to lose its ability to circulate and disperse.</strong> Excess yang qi results in warmth of the body without sweating; excess yin qi leads to abundant sweating and coldness of the body; when both yin and yang are excessive, there is neither sweating nor warmth. <strong>[Note: If the pathogen is in the yang aspect, it causes the body to be warm without sweating. If it is in the yin aspect, it leads to abundant sweating and coldness. When both yin and yang are affected by the pathogen, there will be no sweating and coldness as well.]</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Qi and Its Connection to Health</strong></p>
<p>Due to heat, sweating can lead to shortness of breath and excessive talking when agitated, while silence is marked by restlessness. The body feels like burning charcoal, with sweat pouring out. When sweat is released excessively, it can lead to a state of debilitation. If sweat appears externally, it can cause skin issues like furuncles and rash. Sweating in the wind can lead to coldness and result in itching; internal stagnation may then cause furuncles. If the spirit&#39;s sweat is not fully released, the body becomes weak and the Qi can dissipate. The acupuncture points may be blocked, leading to wind-heat conditions. </p>
<p>When sweat causes one side of the body to feel damp, it indicates that the Yang Qi is weak and cannot circulate freely, resulting in localized debilitation. Visible sweating indicates damp heat is accumulating in the skin, leading to furuncles and rashes. Laboring excessively while sweating in the wind can trap cold dampness in the skin, causing itching. If the spirit&#39;s sweat is not fully released and the external pathogens are not eliminated, the accompanying Yang pathogens remain trapped within. As cold pathogens transform into heat alongside the Yang, this leads to a weak Qi state, and the external Qi cannot penetrate the meridians, resulting in blocked acupuncture points, manifesting as a wind-heat condition without cold symptoms.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>True Words on Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>In summer, if sweat does not flow, autumn will bring wind-cold fever.<br><em>Note: If there is no sweating in summer, the summer heat will be trapped, leading to wind-cold fever in autumn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Heat</strong></p>
<p>Heat should cause sweat to flow; do not stop it.<br><em>Note: The hidden evil and sweat should be expelled together, hence it should not be stopped.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Five Vital Energies</strong></p>
<p>The heart is the source of sweat.<br><em>Note: The heart governs blood; sweat is the fluid of the heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Bone Hollow</strong></p>
<p>Wind enters from the outside, causing chills, sweating, headache, body heaviness, and aversion to cold.<br><em>Note: Wind is a Yang evil that harms the body&#39;s Yang energy, resulting in such illness.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Common People&#39;s Physiognomy</strong></p>
<p>A slippery pulse at the wrist indicates abundant sweating.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Notes: The term &quot;尺肤濇者&quot; refers to wind bi (a type of illness). When the evil influences invade the channels, the pulse becomes slippery. The pathogenic wind obstructs between the skin and the surface, hence causing excessive sweating.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Discussion of Water Heat Points</strong></p>
<p>When one is brave and exerts too much effort, kidney sweat may emerge. If kidney sweat encounters wind, it cannot enter the organs internally or be released through the skin externally; it stays within the source area and circulates beneath the skin, leading to swelling. This condition arises from the kidneys and is termed &quot;wind water.&quot; The &quot;source area&quot; refers to the space of sweat.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: Excessive bravery and labor injure the bones, moving the kidney energy, causing fluids to rise and manifest as sweat. This leads to fluid swelling beneath the skin due to wind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Essential Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In the pulse of the Taiyang (Sun) channel, at its end, the eyes droop and the skin retracts; the color is white. If sweat ceases, death will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: The Qi of the Taiyang channel has been exhausted, hence the drooping and retraction of the eyes. The hand Taiyang governs fluids, while the foot Taiyang stores them. The cessation of sweat means loss of body fluids externally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Pain Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When heat opens the pores, the nutritive and defensive Qi circulate freely, and perspiration flows excessively, thus the Qi is depleted. When one exerts themselves, they pant and sweat, leading to leakage both internally and externally, thus depleting Qi.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: Qi serves as the solidifying force of Yin, while Yin protects Yang. In heat, when the pores open and sweating is excessive, Yang Qi leaks out. When laboring excessively harms the kidney energy, it causes internal panting while Yang Qi disperses and sweats outwards, leading to leakage both internally and externally, hence depleting Qi.</strong><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on the Correspondence Between Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The sweat of Yang is called the rain of heaven and earth.<br>[Note: Sweat emerges from Yin liquid, due to the dispersal of Yang energy; rain is the dampness of the earth, arising from the influences of heaven, hence the comparison.] When Yang is abundant, the body becomes hot, the pores close, breathing is labored, sweat does not emerge, and there is heat, dry teeth, irritability, and fullness in the abdomen leading to death; one can endure winter but not summer. When Yin is abundant, the body becomes cold, sweat emerges, the body is often clear, there are frequent chills, and cold leads to collapse, which in turn results in abdominal fullness and death; one can endure summer but not winter.<br>[Note: Yang represents heat and is active; when heat is on the surface, the pores close and breathing is labored, with minimal sweating. The kidneys govern the essence, the heart governs blood, leading to dry teeth, depletion of essence and blood, and irritability. When the life energy of the middle burner is exhausted, abdominal fullness occurs, signifying a death indicative of excess Yang heat; though one may prolong life in winter, one cannot escape summer&#39;s effects. Conversely, in the case of excess Yin leading to deficiency of Yang, sweating occurs. The coldness of Yin is at the surface, hence the body remains clear; internally, there are frequent chills; when both the surface and interior are cold, the limbs become cold and there is abdominal fullness. This signifies death due to excess Yin cold; if one can still obtain the Yang heat of summer, there may be hope for the Yin cold.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>The Great Treatise on the Six Principles</strong></p>
<p>When the Sun is present, it causes sweating and convulsions.<br>[Note: This is a common ailment of autumn.]</p>
<p><strong>The Great Treatise on Qi Transformation</strong></p>
<p>When the year&#39;s water is excessive, it results in sweating and an aversion to wind.<br>[Note: Excessive year water refers to multiple years of excessive water. When water overflows, the source dries up, and the Yang energy of the sun has no support, resulting in a deficiency of surface Yang, hence sweating and aversion to wind.]</p>
<p><strong>The Great Treatise on the Essential Truth</strong></p>
<p>When the Lesser Yin is at the spring, if it prevails, the soul&#39;s sweat does not retain, rising against the four extremities.<br>[Note: The Qi governing the four extremities is the Taiyin&#39;s damp earth, while the guest Qi is the sun&#39;s cold water. Earth overcomes water, hence the body fluids do not retain and sweat emerges at the surface.]</p>
<p><strong>Classical Text of the Spirit Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section on the Manifestation of Pathogenic Qi in the Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the lung pulse is weak, it leads to excessive sweating.<br>[Note: Weakness indicates that lung heat is excessive, thus leading to sweating.]<br>When mildly weak, sweating below the head cannot be stopped.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The lungs govern the body&#39;s qi and connect with the hundred channels. When the pores open, sweat below the head cannot be stopped; this area is between the neck, chest, and back, beyond the lungs.</p>
<p>The Sun Taiyin channel of the hand governs diseases of the lungs. When qi is excessive, there is pain in the shoulders and back, and sweating from wind-cold leads to windstroke. The lung shu point is located on the back; because lung qi is abundant, it causes pain. Sweating from wind-cold leading to windstroke relates to the three yin and three yang energies on the surface that correspond to the six energies of heaven.</p>
<p>The Foot Yangming channel governs blood-related diseases, such as mania, intermittent fever, and profuse sweating. This is because the stomach controls nourishment and blood; hence it governs blood-related diseases, causing madness and hot intermittent fevers with sweating, which occurs when stomach qi is hot and vaporizes bodily fluids into sweat.</p>
<p>The Hand Shaoyang channel governs diseases related to qi, resulting in sweating. The Shaoyang represents the initial emergence of yang energy, and sweating occurs when yang manifests above yin.</p>
<p>The Foot Shaoyang channel governs diseases related to the bones, which also causes sweating. When the six yang energies are exhausted, yin and yang separate. When they separate, the pores leak, leading to the outflow of sweat. Therefore, divination indicating death in the morning results in death at night, while divination indicating death at night results in death in the morning. This reflects the inability to complete the cycle of the day. </p>
<p>Yang energy is rooted in yin and emerges from yang. Thus, when the six yang energies are on the verge of exhaustion, yin and yang are separated, leading to the escape of yang energy and the outflow of sweat, culminating in the end of yang energy. Hence, divination foretells death at opposite times, indicating the inability to fulfill the cycle of the day.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Febrile Illness</strong></p>
<p>In cases of febrile illness lasting seven or eight days, if the pulse is not agitated but rather remains continuous, and in the last three days there is sweating, it indicates recovery. If there is no sweating by the third day, and still none by the fourth, the patient will die. If the patient has not sweated, do not puncture the skin to draw blood.</p>
<p>[Note: When the febrile illness lasts seven or eight days and the pulse is not agitated, it indicates that the external condition has resolved. If the pulse is agitated but remains continuous, it means that although the evil heat has not departed, the vital energy is not harmed. In the last three days, if the illness extends to eleven days, it is likely that the condition has reverted into the interior, and sweating is necessary to relieve the illness, thus puncturing the skin should be avoided in cases where sweating has not been achieved. If there is no sweating by the third day, it indicates that the yang heat is intense and the yin energy is depleted, resulting in death by the fourth day.]</p>
<p>If the febrile illness has already produced sweating but the pulse remains agitated and intense, it indicates extreme deficiency of yin, resulting in death; if sweating occurs but the pulse is calm, the patient will survive. In febrile illness, if the pulse is still agitated and sweating does not occur, it indicates extreme excess of yang and leads to death; whereas if the pulse is strong and agitated yet achieves calmness upon sweating, the patient has a chance of survival.</p>
<p>[Note: In febrile illness, if sweating has been achieved yet the pulse remains agitated and intense, it indicates extreme internal heat, resulting in death.]<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Those who sweat and have a calm pulse indicate that the heat has been cleared and the pulse is harmonious, hence they survive. In cases of febrile illness, the pulse is still agitated, the disease stemming from external heat affecting the channels. Those who do not sweat cannot resolve the heat from the outside; this is the extreme of external heat, and thus they die. A vigorous and agitated pulse that achieves sweating resulting in a calm pulse signifies the expulsion of external evils through sweat, and so they survive.</p>
<p>In cases of febrile illness where sweat does not emerge, with pronounced redness in the cheeks and hiccups, they die. If there is no sweat and vomiting blood occurs, they die. If there is coughing and nasal bleeding, with no sweat and insufficient blood flow to the feet, they die.</p>
<p>[Note: The absence of sweat indicates external excessive heat that cannot be resolved through sweating. Pronounced redness in the cheeks signifies extreme internal heat of the five organs. Hiccups reflect the conflict between internal and external heat, leading to exhaustion of stomach qi. The absence of sweat with blood vomiting indicates that external heat remains unresolved and has entered the yin. Coughing and nasal bleeding without sweat indicates internal heat reversing in the lungs, with nasal bleeding being surface heat driven by external pressure on the channels. The lungs govern the skin and hair; internal and external heat are all resolved through lung qi via sweating. The absence of sweat means qi is exhausted at the upper level. Insufficient blood flow to the feet means qi is exhausted at the lower level.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Five Runes on Body Fluids</strong></p>
<p>In hot weather, if the clothing is thick, the pores will open, hence sweating occurs.<br><em>Note: The pores refer to the patterns of flesh, where bodily fluids follow the pathways of the three burners and seep between the skin and muscles; thus, when the pores open, sweat greatly flows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Five Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What signs indicate that a person prone to wind-cold and sweating has a weak body? Shao Yu replied: If the flesh is not firm and the pores are loose, then one is susceptible to wind. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we tell if the flesh is not firm? Shao Yu replied: If the hamstring is weak and without structure. The &quot;structure&quot; refers to coarse texture. If the texture is coarse and the skin is not tight, then the pores are loose; this refers to the whole body’s condition.<br><em>Note: Bodily fluids accumulate between the skin and the pores; if the skin is collapsed and the structure is loose, then the fluids leak and become sweat. The energy of the sun governs the skin; thus, if the hamstring is not firm and the texture is coarse, the skin is not tightly structured, then the pores are loose and profuse sweating occurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Five Prohibitions</strong></p>
<p>After profuse sweating, it should not be forcibly expelled.<br><em>Note: When the flesh, blood, and energy are already depleted, even if there is an excess of pathogens, they should not be expelled.</em></p>
<p><strong>Resolving Energy</strong></p>
<p>When the pores open and sweat flows profusely, this is called the body&#39;s fluids. When fluids are lost, the pores are open, and sweat flows heavily.<br><em>Note: The fluids emerge from the pores, thus when the fluids are lost, the pores open, and sweat flows heavily.</em><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>On the Principles of the Defensive and Nutritive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: When a person feels heat and their food has just entered the stomach, if the qi is not stable, sweating will immediately occur—sometimes from the face, sometimes from the back, or sometimes from the midsection. This sweating does not follow the pathway of the defensive qi; what is the reason? Qi Bo answered: This is due to an external injury from wind, which opens the pores, causing the hair to evaporate and allow the defensive qi to escape, thus it cannot follow its proper pathway. This qi is fierce, slippery, and rapid, and when it is opened, it escapes, hence it is called leakage.</p>
<p>The defensive qi flows from the upper jiao; the pathway it follows has never reached the face or the back. Now, when food has just entered the stomach, and the essence of the nutritive and defensive qi is not yet defined, sweating may occur first on the face or on the back. This is the defensive qi not following its path. The defensive qi spreads throughout the body, without failing to nourish any part. If sweating occurs from the midsection, it is a deviation of the defensive qi. The defensive qi is the fierce qi of food and fluids, its nature being fierce, slippery, and rapid; if the pores are not tightly closed, it will escape as soon as they open, hence it cannot follow its path.</p>
<p>The nutritive and defensive qi represent the refined essence. Blood represents the vital essence. Hence, blood and qi are different names for the same category. Thus, if blood is lost, there is no sweat; if sweat is lost, there is no blood. The nutritive and defensive qi arise from the essence of food and liquid. Blood is transformed from the vital essence. Both blood and the nutritive and defensive qi arise from essence, thus they are different names but belong to the same category. Sweat is merely the liquid of blood, transformed from qi into sweat; therefore, if blood is lost, there is no sweat, and if sweat is lost, there is no blood.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Key Points of the Golden Coffer</strong> 【Han, Zhang Ji】</p>
<p><strong>Sweat Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>The chapter on Damp Bi states: If the pulse is superficial due to wind dampness, the body feels heavy and there is excessive sweating with intolerance to wind, the prescription is Fangji Huangqi Decoction. The chapter on Wind Stroke states: If the inch pulse is deep and weak, deep indicates the bones, weak indicates the tendons, deep corresponds to the kidneys, and weak corresponds to the liver. Sweating while entering water feels like water injuring the heart, causing yellow sweat to emerge at the joints, hence called “yellow sweat at the joints.” If the Fuyin pulse is superficial and slippery, the slippery nature indicates fullness of the Qi, while the superficial nature indicates spontaneous sweating. The chapter on Water Qi states: If the pulse is superficial with a heavy body and excessive sweating with intolerance to wind, the prescription is Fangji Huangqi Decoction. If there is abdominal pain, add Shaoyao. For wind water causing intolerable wind, with the whole body swollen, pulse superficial but not thirsty, continuing to sweat without significant heat, the prescription is Yao Bi Decoction.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Question:</strong> What is the illness of &quot;yellow sweat&quot;? The body swells, there is fever, sweating and thirst, resembling wind-water, sweat stains the clothes, the color is exactly yellow like the juice of the licorice plant, and the pulse is sinking. How does one contract this illness? </p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> It is contracted by sweating and then entering water for a bath; the water enters through the sweat pores. The formula for treatment is a decoction of astragalus, peony, cinnamon, and wine.</p>
<p>The illness of yellow sweat manifests with cold in the lower legs. Even if there is fever, this is related to the seasonal changes. If sweating occurs after eating, followed by night sweats, this indicates a deficiency in nourishment and energy. If sweating occurs and then fever returns, and this continues for a long time, the body will have misalignments, and persistent fever will surely lead to the development of sores. If the body feels heavy but the sweat lightens, over time it will lead to trembling; the trembling will cause chest pain, and sweat will flow from above the waist while below there is none. The waist and hips will feel painful and relaxed as if there is something under the skin; in severe cases, one cannot eat, experiences body aches and heaviness, restlessness, and difficulty urinating. This is called yellow sweat, treated with a decoction of cinnamon and astragalus.</p>
<p><strong>Death Signs from Sweating</strong></p>
<p>In cases of heat illness with sweating but a still pulse, if the pulse fluctuates greatly, death will occur. If there is reversal of qi with sweating and a weak and slow pulse, death will occur. If sweat does not flow, death will happen.</p>
<p>If liver-related sweating occurs like water, with fear and restlessness, lying down with a straight gaze and a pale face, death will occur in eight days; it is also referred to as immediate death.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p>
<h3>Sweat and Pulse</h3>
<p>The Song of the Moist Pulse says: &quot;Before the moist pulse, the person sweats heavily.&quot;<br>The Song of Mixed Illnesses says: &quot;The sick person&#39;s head and face are dark blue; sweat seeps through the hair tips like pearls. The eyes are small and bulging, no need for treatment, as the sweat is like oil and cannot be resolved. Inside and out both empty, the body is cold and chills; sweat flows like pearls with slight nausea and irritation. Suddenly the hands and feet turn cold, pulse reversing; if the body is not at ease, death is certain.&quot;<br>The Song of the Kidneys says: &quot;The face is dark, teeth ache, eyes are like the blind; sweating freely like water, the lower back often aches. The skin and flesh are moist, hair lacks luster; within four days, life is not to be expected.&quot;</p>
<h3>Discussion on Cold Damage</h3>
<p>In cold damage, if there is no sweat, there are seven signs; if there is free sweating, there are nine signs. Conditions like solar cold damage, recent heat illness, taiyin disease, shaoyin disease, jueyin disease, yin-yang changing disease, and winter yangming disease all have no sweat. When sweating occurs, the nine signs include disharmony of defenses, common cold, warm winds, dampness, heat strokes, yangming disease, loss of yang, soft convulsions, and cholera; all involve free sweating. However, shaoyin must not have sweat, yet there are signs of spontaneous sweat; yangming disease often presents with much sweat, but also has cases of absence of sweat, which should not be overlooked.<br>Question: &quot;Sweat on the head.&quot; Answer: &quot;The patient is externally solid but internally empty, with the original qi obstructed, causing yang qi to rise and sweat to appear on the head. Whenever there is sweat on the head, it indicates that the five internal organs are dried out, the membranes are empty, and fluids are minimal; careful attention must be paid to avoid purging. If one purges, it is termed severe emptiness. Yet, there are several signs associated with sweating on the head.&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>In cases of cold damage lasting five to six days, if there is sweating on the forehead, slight aversion to cold, cold hands and feet, fullness below the heart, no desire to eat, constipation, and a thin pulse, this indicates a mild yang blockage, meaning there must be symptoms on both the exterior and interior. A submerged pulse also indicates an interior issue. Sweating signifies mild yang; if pure yin were to be blocked, there would be no external symptoms, and everything would descend into the interior, indicating a situation half in the interior and half in the exterior. Although the pulse may be submerged and tight, it cannot be regarded as a condition of lesser yin. The reason for this is that yin cannot produce sweat; since there is sweating on the forehead, it is known not to be lesser yin.</p>
<p>For cold damage lasting five to six days, after sweating has occurred, if there is fullness in the chest and hypochondria, slight blockage, difficult urination, thirst without vomiting, but only sweating on the forehead, this means the exterior is not yet resolved. The patient is likely suffering from stagnant heat in the interior, and the body will likely turn yellow.</p>
<p>In cases of yang brightness disease, after treatment, if there is heat in the exterior, warm hands and feet, no chest blockage, vexation in the heart, and hunger without the ability to eat, but only sweating on the forehead—this is also noteworthy.</p>
<p>If there is tight fullness below the heart, no significant heat, and sweating on the forehead, it indicates a need for attention.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If one experiences sweating and blood in the case of Yangming disease, it results from heat entering the blood chamber. If only head sweat occurs, one should needle the Qimen point and based on the situation, let it drain; once sweating occurs, recovery follows.</p>
<p>Concerning spontaneous sweating in febrile diseases, how is it understood? Spontaneous sweating refers to sweating that occurs naturally, without being induced by external dispersal. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that Yang Qi protects the exterior, providing firmness. The protective Qi guards the skin, ensuring the pores are full and preventing fluids from leaking. When sweating occurs, it expels evil qi. If the protective Qi is inadequate and cannot maintain firmness, the skin loosens and the pores become too open, leading to the unwanted leakage of fluids, which results in spontaneous sweating. If a person has a fever and sweats without recovery, it indicates disharmony in the protective Qi, with Wind evil interfering with it. If one has heat stroke with sweating, a sensation of chill, body heat, and thirst, it indicates Summer evil interfering with the protective Qi. When there’s excessive sweating and dampness, it is due to excessive Wind-Damp evil interfering with the protective Qi. Thus, it is understood that protective Qi secures fluids, preventing their unwarranted leakage; it is always due to the interference of evil Qi that sweating begins. The poisons of Wind, Cold, Summer, and Dampness are the atmospheric evils of the four seasons, which cause febrile diseases in individuals. Both Wind and Summer-Dampness are evils that induce spontaneous sweating. However, Cold alone harms the body without causing sweating. Cold injures the nutrients but does not harm the protective Qi; when there is no interference from evil Qi, the skin remains tight, and the fluids stay intact, which is why sweating does not occur.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>As the qi gradually enters the interior and transforms into heat, it also leads to spontaneous sweating. This occurs because when there is heat, the protective and nutritive qi communicate, the pores open, and sweat is released. However, signs of spontaneous sweating also have distinctions between exterior and interior, and differences between deficiency and excess. If there is sweating accompanied by aversion to wind or slight aversion to cold, this indicates that the exterior has not yet resolved and one must wait for dispersal before recovery. In cases where the sweating does not stop and there is aversion to wind, or if there is aversion to cold after sweating, this indicates a deficiency in the exterior; one must wait for warming of the channels to recover. All these are instances where pathogenic qi is present on the exterior. If the sweating occurs without aversion to cold, this indicates that the exterior has resolved but the interior is still unharmonized. The classics say: When the Yangming causes fever and sweat, it is called heat surpassing. They also say: If the Yangming disease has fever and abundant sweating, it must be urgently purged. This is not the same as sweating that occurs due to pathogenic qi on the exterior, which can be mitigated. Spontaneous sweating in cases of cold damage is common. If sweating occurs and feels oily or is as large as beads, or if sweat emerges without flowing, these are signs of a condition that cannot be treated. It is essential for both hands and feet to be warm and the entire body to be moist, gently perspiring for a time until the heat dissipates and the body cools and harmonizes; this is the ideal condition. This reflects the harmony of yin and yang, the rise of water and the descent of fire, the flow of nutritive and protective qi, and the exit and resolution of pathogenic qi. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The sweat of Yang is named after the rain of heaven and earth; this is it.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Night Sweats</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold-induced night sweats, how can we clarify this? Night sweats refer to sweating during sleep. Spontaneous sweating may occur whether one is asleep or awake, arising naturally. Night sweats, however, cannot occur without sleep; they manifest only when asleep, and stop upon waking. In instances of mixed diseases causing night sweats, one attributes it to Yang deficiency. The night sweats due to cold injury are not the same deficiency as in mixed diseases; rather, they result from pathogenic influences being present both internally and externally. How so? If the pathogenic influence were purely external, it would naturally cause sweating by affecting the defensive (Wei) Qi. In this case, the pathogenic influence can penetrate the interior while still connected to the exterior. During sleep, the defensive Qi operates inwardly, while the Yang Qi at the surface is insufficient, leading to the loss of fluid, hence sweating during sleep; upon waking, the Qi disperses outward and the sweating ceases. The classics say: &quot;If slight night sweats occur accompanied by chills and aversion to cold, the exterior has not yet resolved.&quot; Additionally, in Yangming disease, if there is a need for the interior to be full while the pulse is floating, it indicates night sweats, which suggests the presence of external pathogens. Moreover, in cases of simultaneous Yang syndromes, one may notice spontaneous sweating. This illustrates that night sweats arise from a pathogenic influence situated between the surface and the interior. Furthermore, spontaneous sweating can arise from both deficiency (vacuity) and excess (repletion). In the case of night sweats, it is not the same as spontaneous sweating due to repletion; attention must be paid solely to harmonizing the exterior, which should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Head Sweating</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to head sweating, how is this understood? The head is where all the Yang channels converge. When pathogenic factors invade the Yang, and the fluids gather upwards, sweating occurs on the head. If internal heat accumulates and evaporates through the pores, causing sweating all over the body, this is referred to as excess heat. If there is no sweating from the body, then the heat does not escape. When heat steams in the Yang, only sweating from the head occurs. Why is this? Because the channels of the three Yin run up to the neck and chest and then return, without following to the head; only the Yang channels ascend to the head.</p>
<p>The scripture states: if sweating occurs only on the head, and not on the body, and it returns to the neck, with difficulty in urination and thirst for water, this indicates that stagnant heat resides within, and the body must turn yellow, as the heat cannot ascend upwards. Additionally, if heat enters the blood chamber, causing vexation, or if the Yangming is consumed by fire, or if water accumulates in the chest, all result in sweating from the head; these too are due to internal heat stagnation and inability to escape.</p>
<p>In these instances, whether by vomiting or purging, the aim is to eliminate the heat. Some might say that the symptoms of head sweating belong entirely to Yangming and represent internal heat, but could there be cases not associated with Yangming but rather with the exterior? It is also the case that when the pathogens are only on the surface, there are no symptoms of head sweating. Only when cold and damp clash, with the pathogenic qì half on the surface and half inside, does head sweating occur.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>After suffering from a febrile illness for five or six days, having induced sweating but then experiencing a relapse, the chest and sides feel full and slightly constricted, urination is not smooth, there is thirst without vomiting, but there is sweating on the forehead, alternating chills and fever, and restlessness. </p>
<p>Likewise, after five or six days of febrile illness, if there is sweating on the forehead, a mild aversion to cold, cold hands and feet, fullness beneath the heart, loss of appetite, constipation, and a thin pulse, this indicates that the pathogenic influence is half in the superficial and half in the deep, resulting in sweat on the forehead. </p>
<p>For those with dampness, only sweating on the forehead, desiring to be covered and facing the fire indicates a struggle between cold and dampness, leading to sweating on the forehead as well. </p>
<p>All these conditions are provoked by pathogenic influences causing natural sweating on the forehead, and should not be interpreted as a reversal. If urination is not smooth, it is adverse to find sweating on the forehead; for those with dampness, after purging, it is also adverse to see sweating on the forehead. These two conditions are what constitute the reversal of sweating on the forehead. Why is this? Because difficulty in urination creates a blockage; when sweating on the forehead occurs, it indicates yang collapse. </p>
<p>The classic states: When blockage prevents urination, if there is no sweat on the head, there is survival, but if there is sweating, there is death. For those with dampness, if sweating appears on the forehead and there is slight gasping, it also indicates yang collapse. </p>
<p>The classic states: For those with dampness and purging, if sweating appears on the forehead and urination is difficult, they die; if there is continuous diarrhea, they also die. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; says: When yang energy rises and sweat appears on the head, it signifies yang collapse. Knowing what can be treated and treating it, as well as knowing what cannot be treated and not treating it, all those who attain completeness depend on clear discernment and careful judgment.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>In cases of febrile disease where the hands and feet sweat, what can be deduced? The limbs are the foundation of all Yang, and the stomach governs the limbs. Sweating in the hands and feet is a manifestation of Yangming. When the Yang channels are affected by heat, it leads to sweating in the hands and feet. Yangming is also the master of bodily fluids; hence, spontaneous sweating occurs. Those who experience sweating all over the body, only on the head, or specifically in the hands and feet all belong to the category of Yangming. Why does this happen? If there is sweating all over the body, it is said to be &quot;heat excess,&quot; indicating heat reaching the surface. If sweating occurs only on the head, it means the heat cannot escape, and the heat rises upwards. When sweating is confined to the hands and feet, it indicates that heat is concentrated in the stomach, affecting the fluids. The record states: when hands and feet sweat profusely, the stool must be difficult; when they sweat a little, and the stool is hard with aphasia, purging will lead to recovery. From this, it is clear that sweating in the hands and feet indicates heat accumulation in the stomach. </p>
<p>Some may ask: if heat gathers in the stomach causing sweating in the hands and feet, is it possible for cold accumulation in the stomach to also cause sweating? The record states: when cold is in the Yangming, one cannot eat, urination is difficult, and there is profuse sweating in the hands and feet, this points to the desire to develop a mass, showing that it is indeed cold accumulation. Moreover, heat accumulation in the stomach signifies a condition that can be purged, while cold accumulation indicates one that cannot. How can this be clarified? To differentiate both conditions, it must be noted that if the stool initially is hard and later becomes soft, it signifies that the stomach is cold, leading to a lack of separation between food and drink, which is why purging is not appropriate. If the stool is hard and there are symptoms of Yangming, it is indeed an indication for purging. Thus, in the time of encountering a disease, careful consideration is essential.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>No Sweat</strong></p>
<p>How can we explain the absence of sweat in cases of cold damage? The pores (腠理) are where fluids exude and converge, while the meridians (理) are the junctions where patterns meet. Fluids can be affected by wind, heat, and dampness; when they accumulate at the skin&#39;s surface, sweat is produced. However, if a cold pathogen penetrates the channels and compresses the pores, there will be no sweat as fluids cannot seep out. </p>
<p>The lack of sweat can arise from several conditions: if the cold damage remains superficial or the pathogen moves inward, or if water-damp accumulates internally, or from a prolonged deficiency of yang. All these can lead to an absence of sweat, indicating that the pores are tightly closed. When wind is caught in the defensive (卫), the pores open and sweating occurs. Conversely, when cold penetrates to the nutritive (荣), sweating does not occur, signifying the closure of the pores.</p>
<p>The classics discuss conditions such as &quot;sun disease with aversion to wind, no sweat, and wheezing,&quot; along with signs of a floating, tight pulse without sweat and fever, restlessness without sweating, as well as yangming disease presenting with no sweat but frequent urination, vomiting, and coughing over two to three days, along with cold extremities and headache, a dry nose, and an inability to sweat. All these patterns indicate the presence of a cold pathogen at the surface leading to a lack of sweating. Conversely, when the pathogen acts internally without sweat, it signifies that the external pathogen has not been expelled properly, resulting in no sweating.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The classic text states that in cases where Yangming disease presents without sweating, with difficult urination and a feeling of discomfort in the heart, the body will inevitably turn yellow; similarly, in cases of cold damage with fever and no sweating, thirst with a desire to drink water, and without exterior symptoms, the prescription of Baihu Decoction with Ginseng is indicated. In cases of the three Yin conditions where sweating does not occur, these symptoms indicate that evil is acting internally without producing sweat. The accumulation of fluids within the body, without sweating, leads to the formation of phlegm and bodily fluids; when fluids are retained internally and fail to flow, there will be insufficient bodily fluids to produce sweat. </p>
<p>Regarding the prescription of Gui Zhi Decoction or purgatives, if there is still persistent headache, heat sensation, and no sweating, along with fullness and slight pain beneath the heart, and difficult urination, one should modify the formula by removing cinnamon and adding Fuling and Baizhu. This is again due to the infiltration of bodily fluids without producing sweat. If there is Yang deficiency without sweating, Yang is the master of bodily fluids; when Yang is deficient, the bodily fluids become insufficient, resulting in no sweating. </p>
<p>The text further explains that a floating and slow pulse indicates absence of Yang, which cannot produce sweat, leading to itching of the body. In Yangming disease, when there is no sweating, the skin may feel as if insects are crawling beneath it, which is a sign of prolonged deficiency; thus, it is all due to Yang deficiency and lack of sweating. This reasoning aligns with the principles of medicine; how could it be considered different? If a person should sweat but does not, and after taking one dose of herbal decoction the symptoms persist, then if after three doses there is still no sweating, this is considered a critical illness. Additionally, in cases of heat illness with a rapid pulse where sweating is absent, Huangdi declares this to be at the extreme of Yang pulse, indicating death. These two cases regard the absence of sweating as the true illness; how could they be equated with other instances of no sweating in a casual manner?<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>On the Dominance of Dampness Over Yang</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: Is dampness associated with yin or yang? I said: It is related to the southwest, the earth. Sweat in humans is akin to rain in heaven and earth; when yin nourishes its dampness, it manifests as mist and dew. Yin dampness is cold and descends, representing the earth&#39;s qi. When there is excessive sweat, it leads to a loss of yang; when yang departs, yin prevails, resulting in great coldness. When dampness dominates, one&#39;s voice sounds as if emerging from a jar; dampness feels like being submerged in water. It is said among practitioners that the sound of earth resembles that from deep inside a jar, signifying obstruction and inability to emerge, clearly indicating dampness. Moreover, it is understood that these two—dampness and cold—are yin. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: when qi is deficient, external cold affects us. Even if one appears to sweat from internal heat, in the end, it transmits to great cold. One must recognize that it initially begins as internal heat, but when the exterior is deficient and yang is lost, it cannot withstand external cold, eventually leading to coldness inside and often resulting in rheumatic cold. Colors reflect the heavens, pulses reflect the earth; the form of a person corresponds to the yin and yang of the earth. Therefore, through pulse and qi, we evaluate both the visible and invisible aspects.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Night Sweats</strong></p>
<p>Night sweats refer to sweating profusely during sleep, similar to bathing, which stops upon waking. This condition is associated with Yin deficiency, where the nourishment of blood is affected; therefore, it is advisable to nourish Yin and decrease fire, using a formula like Danggui Liuhuang Decoction. If there is a deficiency of cold, Huangqi Liuyi Decoction can be used instead. For night sweats caused by heat due to Yin deficiency, one can use Siwu Decoction with Huangbo; if there is also Qi deficiency, add Ren Shen, Huangqi, and Baizhu. In children, night sweats do not require treatment as their blood is still insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>No Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When genuine Qi is depleted and stomach fire is excessive, sweating does not stop, indicating that the genuine Qi in the stomach has already been exhausted. If Yin fire has declined, lack of sweating leads to restlessness, showing that both Yin and Yang are weak. Lack of sweating in all seasons does not last long; dampness declines while dryness increases, which is a regular principle. The short-lived form indicates that autumn qi is associated with death, leading to the depletion of vitality. Vitality refers to the stomach&#39;s vital energy, which is the transformative energy generated in spring&#39;s lesser Yang.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Xi&#39;s Heart Method</strong> (by Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Spontaneous sweating is related to Qi deficiency, blood deficiency, dampness, Yang deficiency, and phlegm. Dongyuan has methods and formulas, including Ren Shen and Huangqi, with a slight addition of Guizhi. For Yang deficiency, a small amount of Fuzi can also be used, but it must be boiled in urine. Fire steaming the dampness in the stomach can also lead to sweating; Cool the Diaphragm Powder is indicated. Phlegm conditions can also cause sweating. A major taboo for spontaneous sweating is ginger, as it opens the pores.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Night Sweats</strong></p>
<p>Night sweats are associated with deficiency of blood and yin, and do not require treatment in children. Avoid using fresh ginger. There is a prescription by Dongyuan that uses a formula with six yellow herbs and angelica, which is very effective, but the medicinal properties are cold. For those who are weak, only use a formula of astragalus and six parts. If night sweats are accompanied by heat due to yin deficiency, add the four substances plus coptis; if combined with qi deficiency, include ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes. Night sweats refer to sweating during sleep; if not sleeping, sweating does not occur. When in deep sleep, sweat may emerge, but it stops upon waking, unlike spontaneous sweating which occurs without sleep. In cases of night sweats caused by mixed illnesses, they are attributed to yang deficiency. Those with night sweats from cold-induced illness are also related to heart deficiency. It is advisable to gather heart energy and nourish kidney water, so that yin and yang are harmonized, allowing the regulation of water and fire, causing the sweating to cease.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Sweat</strong></p>
<p>When there is no sweat elsewhere, but sweat is present in the heart region, excessive thinking leads to more sweating. The issue lies in heart use, so it is advisable to nourish heart blood. Use moxa-steamed decoction, adjusting with one penny of poria powder. This is called heart sweat. Additionally, second leaves of blue mulberry dried and powdered, mixed with empty rice drink, are the best for stopping night sweats.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The classics say: the fluid of the heart is sweat. &quot;The Original Patterns of Disease&quot; states: heat in the heart causes sweating. Dong Yuan says: the southwest corresponds to the earth, which in humans relates to the spleen and stomach. The sweat of a person is like the rain of heaven and earth; when the yin nourishes its moisture, it becomes mist, dew, and rain. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the heart alone governs, yet Dong Yuan also refers to the spleen and stomach—why is that? It is because the heart, being the sovereign fire, governs heat, while the spleen and stomach, governed by earth, control moisture. The combination of moisture and heat leads to sweat. Similarly, the earth’s humidity rises as clouds and mist; if the heavens do not provide rain, it cannot accumulate into a downpour. It is also like liquor being heated in a steamer; without boiling and steaming, it cannot become liquid sweat. Each organ can cause sweating, but the heart and the spleen-stomach specifically govern moisture and heat, thus they are the main controllers. Therefore, the classics also state: when one has eaten excessively, sweat emerges from the stomach. In shock, one loses essence, and sweat emerges from the heart. Carrying heavy loads over long distances, sweat emerges from the kidneys. Running in fear, sweat emerges from the liver. Exhaustion from labor causes sweat to emerge from the spleen. As for spontaneous perspiration and night sweats, they resemble each other but are fundamentally different. Spontaneous perspiration occurs incessantly, worsened by movement, and belongs to yang deficiency; it is governed by the protective qi. Night sweats, on the other hand, occur while sleeping, making the body feel drenched, stopping only upon awakening; it relates to yin deficiency and is governed by the nutritious blood. Generally, spontaneous perspiration should be treated by tonifying yang and regulating the protective qi, whereas night sweats should be addressed by nourishing yin and lowering fire. Therefore, in cases of heart deficiency with cold sweat emerging, it is suitable to nourish the liver, enhance the origin of fire, and dispel the yin shadows; in cases of yin deficiency with fiery symptoms, the method should be to nourish the kidneys, strengthen the water element, and control the yang fire.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Dai Sigong during the Ming Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Sweat Disorders</strong>  </p>
<p>Nocturnal sweating, which occurs during deep sleep, is called &quot;night sweats,&quot; also known as &quot;sleeping sweats.&quot; Sweating that occurs regardless of whether one is sitting or lying down is termed &quot;spontaneous sweating.&quot; Sweating from wind, heat, cold, dampness, or cough corresponds to spontaneous sweating, which is documented in the relevant sections. For those who sweat profusely without any illness or those who sweat excessively after an illness, both scenarios pertain to deficiency of the exterior, instability of stomach qi, and leakage of mother blood. It is advisable to use Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang with a small addition of floating wheat or to apply Yu Ping Feng San. </p>
<p>For essential sweating accompanied by a normal body temperature yet producing cold sweat, or cold body sweat that remains cold without any other illness, this also falls under the same category. If there is phlegm-associated cold sweating, then Qi Qi Tang should be administered. When there is Qi blockage leading to persistent spontaneous sweating, treatment to adjust Qi and harmonize the defensive and nutritive systems is necessary, typically using Xiao Jian Zhong Tang with the addition of Mu Xiang. </p>
<p>In cases of post-illness excessive sweating, if taking major tonics like Zheng Yuan Yin does not yield improvement, Ba Zhen San should be used. When experiencing yin-type sweat, applying powdered Mi Tuo Seng and She Chuang Zi will provide immediate relief. If sweating persists despite medication, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang with a piece of cooked Fu Zi (with skin left on) or Zheng Yuan Yin should be administered, alongside warm powder application. </p>
<p>For severe continuous sweating, it is advisable to incorporate powdered calcined oyster shell into various remedies and consume pearl powder or hair pearl powder as treatment.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>For those who sweat excessively throughout the year, it is advisable to use black tin pills. Those who have recovered from a serious illness and are still sweating may also take them. This condition should not be treated with heat supplements; it requires balancing the yin and yang for self-healing, and should primarily focus on spiritual sand pills. This is not meant to address other ailments but is specifically for stopping sweating; it does not indicate that there are coexisting diseases.</p>
<p>If one takes various medicines without halting the sweating, but instead finds that the medicine makes one hotter and the sweating worsens, it simply affects the heart&#39;s blood. Sweat is a fluid of the heart; when the heart lacks nourishment, it cannot hold blood, leading to overflow as sweat. Therefore, one should use a decoction of rhubarb and astragalus with half a qian of roasted sour jujube seeds. If there is mild heat, add half a qian of roasted dendrobium, and also take the spiritual sand pills.</p>
<p>Sweat that is sticky like glue, or as condensed as pearls, or drips down heavily like rain, and cannot be wiped away, is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>For those who sweat excessively and have an underlying deficiency heat, one should not resort to heat but should use astringent medicines. If sweating occurs with pathogenic heat and the person is not thirsty, the best remedy is a modified Xiao Chai Hu decoction with half a qian of cinnamon twig.</p>
<p>To treat heart deficiency with excessive sweating and insomnia, take one wild boar&#39;s heart, cut it open while still bleeding, and add two taels of ginseng and two taels of angelica. Cook this mixture, then remove the two herbs and only eat the boar&#39;s heart. Within three or four days, the condition will be cured.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles - Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweating</strong></p>
<p>The theory of ordinary human constitution states: when the radial pulse is slippery, it is referred to as excessive sweating. Wang&#39;s commentary states that both the skin and radial pulse are slippery. A slippery skin indicates a depletion of vital blood within. Furthermore, the &quot;Needling Classic&quot; states: when the pores open and sweat flows profusely, this is referred to as &quot;fluid.&quot; When the fluids deplete, the pores are open and sweat drains excessively. According to these two texts, in cases of excessive spontaneous sweating where blood is depleted and fluids are lost, the treatment principle is to use Dongyuan Zhengyang Decoction, which includes stir-fried Huangbo, Zhimu, and the type of Danggui Liuhuang Decoction, among others.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Head Sweat</strong></p>
<p>Head sweat emerges from the neck and returns; it is a blood condition. Why is there more on the forehead? It is said: The head is where the six Yangs converge, thus heat steams and causes sweat to emerge. More sweat on the forehead is because the left cheek pertains to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the nose to the middle burner, the mandible to the kidneys, and the forehead to the heart. The fire of the triple burner exhausts the kidney water, and what remains is forced upward into the heart region; therefore, it manifests as head sweat, and the excess on the forehead belongs to the heart category as a blood condition. If head sweat appears after drinking wine or consuming food, it is also a blood condition. As for mixed conditions, when the fire of the heart pushes the kidney water upward into the heart, it causes night sweats or spontaneous sweating, which may lead to head sweat or a sensation of fullness in the heart area; all these are treated similarly as blood conditions. Regardless of whether there are cold damage or mixed diseases from wine accumulation, if there is a sense of fullness under the heart, it indicates a blood condition. Why is that? It is said: If one purges and loses Yin, losing Yin means damaging the spleen and stomach and losing blood, with Qi trapped in the chest, leading to diminished blood and consequent fullness in the heart area. Thus, it feels full under the heart. People believe that blood diseases should utilize Qi medicine to guide it, but this exacerbates the fullness issue, and if purged again, it transforms into a sensation of bloating—not the proper treatment. How should one then treat this? One should solely nourish the middle burner with spleen tonics and use blood medicine to treat it; there is no better method than this.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Sweat is the true essence of the original yang. Those who sweat excessively due to food, fear, labor, or movement are termed as having excessive sweating. Sweating persistently without regard to day or night is called spontaneous sweating. This indicates a deficiency of yang energy in defense. For excessive sweating due to heat, one should use the &quot;Supplementing the Middle and Enhancing Qi Decoction&quot; with added Ephedra root and Floating Wheat. Elevating agents such as Rhubarb and Cinnamon should be stir-fried with honey to mitigate their uplifting nature, and they should guide Ginseng and Astragalus to the skin&#39;s surface, hence they are essential. For sweating with cold limbs, use the &quot;Ancient Astragalus and Attachia Decoction&quot; or &quot;Shun Yuan Powder.&quot; If both qi and blood are deficient, employ the &quot;Astragalus Building the Middle Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>For spontaneous sweating accompanied by phlegm syndrome, dizziness, and vomiting, it is appropriate to take a decoction of Chuanxiong, Atractylodes, Chenpi (dried tangerine peel), and licorice. If there is excessive sweating with a soft body, this indicates dampness. The heart governs heat, and the spleen governs dampness; when damp-heat clashes, it is like the moisture of the earth that condenses into clouds, mist, or rain. All organs can produce sweat, but mainly the heart and spleen-stomach are the principals of damp-heat. The &quot;Regulating Defense Decoction&quot; or &quot;Yupingfeng Powder&quot; should be employed. </p>
<p>When fire blazes upwards, and dampness causes sweating in the stomach, use &quot;Cooling the Diaphragm Powder.&quot; For stomach heat, employ the &quot;Two Sweet Decoction.&quot; It is clear that spontaneous sweating can indeed be of a solid nature. Therefore, the initial symptoms of external pathogenic influence often include spontaneous sweating. For wind syndrome, use &quot;Cinnamon Twig Decoction&quot; with added Aconite; for cold syndrome, &quot;Ancient Cinnamon and Aconite Decoction&quot;; for暑症 (heat syndrome), &quot;Five Reeds Powder&quot;; for wind-damp coinciding, use &quot;Fangji and Astragalus Decoction.&quot; In cases of prolonged spontaneous sweating where Ginseng, Astragalus, and Aconite do not work, one should nourish heart blood. If sweating is dry but still accompanied by heat, it must be due to an external wind pathogen, and one should use &quot;Ginseng and Perilla Decoction,&quot; stopping once the illness is resolved; this is a method of counteracting treatment.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Night Sweats</strong></p>
<p>Perspiration during sleep, which diminishes upon waking. When asleep, the protective qi flows internally and the exterior is weak; when waking, the qi disperses to the exterior, halting the sweat. If there is excessive heart fire leading to loss of lung protection, use Gui Zhi Liu Huang Tang. If there is Yin deficiency with fire movement, use Si Wu Tang with additionalzhi and bi. If there is also qi deficiency, add Ren Shen, Qi, and Bai Zhu. If there is severe kidney fire, use Zheng Qi Tang. For spleen dampness, use Si Zhi Bai Zhu San. If there is liver heat, use Fang Feng and Long Dan Cao in powdered form mixed with rice drink. If there is heart deficiency, mix 2.5 qian each of Ren Shen and Dang Gui, first boiling pig heart&#39;s blood to clarify, then use the juice to decoct the herbs. If excessive thinking leads to sweating from the heart orifice alone, mix Ai Tang with 1 qian of Fu Ling powder, or use the second round leaves of green mulberry, collected with dew and air-dried, or toasted to powder, mixed with rice drink. Alternatively, use Gu Zhi Sha San or Tong Yong Huang Qi Liu Yi Tang with added floating wheat, oyster, and Ma Huang root, applying powdered Wu Bei Zi and Bai Fan externally to seal the navel with body fluids, stopping sweating overnight. Another option is to mix equal parts of oyster, wheat flour, Ma Huang root, dried leaves, glutinous rice, Fang Feng, and Bai Zhi into powder and apply all over the body.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Zhongzi’s Essential Readings on Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Various Sweating Disorders</strong></p>
<p>I humbly note that what the heart contains within is blood, and what is outside is sweat. Sweat is the fluid of the heart, and since the kidneys regulate the five fluids, there has never been a case of sweating disorder that does not arise from deficiency of heart blood. When heart yang is deficient, it cannot guard the exterior, leading to spontaneous sweating from exterior injuries; when kidney yin declines, it cannot nourish and retreat inwardly, resulting in nocturnal sweating from internal injuries. However, the sweating from these two conditions differs in terms of temperature. If cold qi invades due to yang deficiency, the sweat produced will certainly be cold; if hot qi invades due to yin deficiency, the sweat will certainly be hot. Nonetheless, excessive heat can injure and transform into cold, which should also not be neglected. </p>
<p>As for those with lung deficiency, to secure the skin and hair, one may use Huangqi Liuyi Decoction or Yupingfeng Powder. For spleen deficiency, to strengthen the interior qi, one might take Buzhong Yiqi Decoction or Sijunzi Decoction. For heart deficiency, to nourish the blood vessels, Donggui Liuhuang Decoction is indicated. In cases of spleen deficiency, one should restrict the dispersing effects, using Baishao, Zaoren, and Wumei. For kidney deficiency, to aid in sealing and storage, one can use Wuweizi, Shanzhuyu, Longgu, Digupi, Muli, Yuanzi, Wubeizi, and Heshouwu. </p>
<p>Furthermore, inside the five organs, there are nuances of warmth and clarity, moisture and dryness. It is inappropriate to apply rigid methods to an ever-changing array of conditions.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment of Various Sweating Symptoms from Cold Damage</h3>
<p>For spontaneous sweating accompanied by aversion to wind and cold, use Guizhi Decoction. If there is aversion to cold with spontaneous sweating, it indicates deficiency of the exterior; Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction or Huangqi Jian Zhong Decoction may be used. If spontaneous sweating occurs without aversion to wind and cold, it indicates exhaustion of the exterior and is accompanied by interior excess; use Chengqi Decoction. If sweating is profuse and accompanied by frequent urination, this indicates depletion of body fluids; although the stool may be dry and cannot be purged, it is advisable to use honey decoction. The method involves simmering honey in a copper container over low heat until slightly thickened, stirring it to avoid burning, then adding a small amount of ground soapwort and shaping it into jujube-sized balls. After cooling, administer through the mouth to facilitate bowel movement. For spontaneous sweating with thirst and difficulty in urination, use Wuling Powder. If sweating persists excessively, it is called loss of yang; use Guizhi Fuzhu Decoction and externally apply a combination of Bai Zhu, Jiao Ben, Chuan Xiong, and Bai Zhi (each one tael), along with crushed oyster shell and rice flour (each two taels, finely powdered) in a gauze bag, applying it all over the body. </p>
<p>If sweating occurs at the interface of the interior and exterior, it indicates heat in the gallbladder; use Xiaochaihu Decoction. If sweating arises from the head, indicating that heat cannot be expelled and yang qi is rising, leading to delirium, use Chengqi Decoction. If there is fullness beneath the heart and sweating from the head, it indicates water accumulation in the chest; use Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction. If sweating from the head causes difficulty in urination, it can be fatal. For sweating in the hands and feet with dry stool and delirium, use Dazhengqi Decoction. If cold prevents eating and urination is unbeneficial, causing undifferentiated water and food, along with sweating in the hands and feet, use Lizhong Decoction.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweating</strong></p>
<p>What is stored in the heart, when internal, is blood; when external, it manifests as sweat. Sweat is the essence of the heart, and the condition of spontaneous sweating arises from both the heart and kidneys being deficient. Therefore, when yin and yang are deficient, the pores will open and cause heat, leading to spontaneous sweating. This is fundamentally due to the imbalance of yin and yang. Additionally, conditions such as wind injury, heat stroke, dampness, fright, excessive sexual activity, extreme fatigue, seasonal changes, intestinal abscesses, phlegm and fluid accumulation, and postpartum conditions can also cause spontaneous sweating. Zhongjing noted that when the flesh is exhausted, bodily fluids escape, the pores open, and sweat pours out. Chao&#39;s commentary states that in cases of deficient labor, if yang energy is significantly deficient, the fluids will disperse as sweat. It is also said that heat in the heart will open the pores, and when the pores open, sweating occurs. The various explanations from different schools regarding sweating generally align with this understanding. Upon investigation, it is realized that sweat is a discharge of bodily fluids. Fluids and qi are similar in nature; where qi reaches, fluids inevitably follow. Therefore, the statement in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that the heart is linked to sweat is of great significance! The heart is the governing organ of yang, and yang represents fire and qi; thus, all the yang of the five organs and six bowels is overseen by the heart to facilitate its transformations.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Therefore, fluid production follows the location of the yang energy and also corresponds to where the fire disturbance occurs, leading to sweating, which ultimately exits through the heart. Otherwise, why would the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mention wind, labor, and the struggle between yin and yang, with sweat emerging from various organs? The five internal organs and six hollow organs must rely on the meridians for nourishment and defense, as the meridians serve as pathways for the movement of qi. The nourishment meridian nourishes yin and blood, while the defensive meridian secures yang energy. When yang energy is firm, the pores are healthy, the original cavity is secure, and the connections between the organs and meridians are seamless. If the internal organs and external meridians are disconnected, their interchanges are disrupted; thus, if illness is internal, the original cavity is not secure, and sweat emerges from the organs; if the illness is on the surface, then the pores are not firm, and sweat escapes from the meridians. Therefore, the causes of sweating are numerous. As for the yin of the organs blocking the defensive qi and dispersing outward without support, it may be due to weak stomach qi causing dispersion of food essence or weak lung qi unable to circulate nourishment and defense, resulting in spontaneous sweating. Such cases, even if severe, still hold potential for treatment, but for those whose three yang are completely exhausted, the sweating cannot be treated.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Night Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When the defensive qi moves through the night in the yin, it may encounter the six excesses of nature on the surface, or be affected by the changes in human qi due to the rise and fall of vitality, similar to the five evils and six excesses of the heavens that interact within. Additionally, the yin and yang within the organs and meridians may counteract each other, leading to a deficiency of yang qi. However, it is not only cold, dampness, and dryness that can harm yang. Wind, fire, and heat, which align with yang, can also inflict damage, particularly when the fire of the heart rises from the kidneys and liver along the four meridians, leading to even greater harm. </p>
<p>Fire cannot coexist with original qi; thus, when fire is excessive, yang is diminished. The defensive qi and yang are one; therefore, when yang is weak, the defense is also deficient. The deficiency of the defensive qi operates in yin; during sleep, there is even less qi to secure the surface, causing the pores to open and fluids to leak out as sweat. When awake, with the eyes open, the yin qi re-disperses to the surface, and the sweating ceases. This condition is called night sweating, specifically the perspiration that occurs during sleep. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that those with kidney ailments may experience abdominal swelling, limb edema, wheezing, coughing, and sweating during sleep. Additionally, excessive water elements or severe influences from the earth may lead to similar conditions.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Note: When the kidney evil attacks the lungs and heart, it internally produces subtle heart fluids as sweat, leading to nocturnal sweating. In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases,&quot; this is termed night sweats. It is stated that in the case of yangming disease, one should expect internal fullness, and if the pulse is floating, it must be night sweating. Additionally, in the case of the three yang diseases combined, if the eyes connect, there will be sweating. Cheng Wujing commented that cold-induced night sweats are not merely due to yang deficiency as in other mixed diseases, but are caused by the evil residing between the exterior and interior. Why? If the evil Qi resides entirely on the exterior, affecting the defensive Qi, then spontaneous sweating occurs. However, if the evil Qi invades the interior and connects to the exterior, then when one sleeps, the defensive Qi moves into the interior, sustaining the interior Yang Qi, leading to the leakage of fluids and resulting in night sweats. This is not solely a result of deficiency, but must also be a result of some level of fullness, and regarding night sweats, it should still be considered an exterior condition. Observing Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s two discussions may seem different, but upon close examination of their subtleties, they can be seen as one and the same. Why is this? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses the source, stating that the heart and kidneys are the masters of Yin and Yang, thus sweating must arise from the Yang of the heart, and sleeping must arise from the Yin of the kidneys. Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s statements follow the Yin and Yang based on the location of the evil, thus resulting in night sweats; this specifically pertains to the flow of Yin and Yang.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>To trace its origins, it is entirely the function of the defensive Qi. Defensive Qi is transformed from the Qi of food and nourished by the lungs. However, the true Yang of heaven must be present in order to be abundant; without it, it weakens. Therefore, the discussion on the Yang Qi in the Treatise on the Vital Energy of Life refers to it as a heavenly Qi, which, when followed, solidifies the Yang. This is aligned with the outer defensive Qi. Wang&#39;s commentary connects the defensive Qi with the Yang Qi of heaven and earth. </p>
<p>While the interpretation by Zhang Zhongjing of achieving non-self is indeed commendable, it is not entirely appropriate. For those suffering from miscellaneous ailments, can one blame solely the deficiency of Yang without considering the deficiency of Yin? I have observed that in cases of sweating during various illnesses, there are instances of both cold and hot sweat—there must be a reason for this. When heat evil invades the Yin deficiency, the resulting sweat is bound to be hot; meanwhile, when cold evil invades the Yang deficiency, the resulting sweat is bound to be cold. The explanation for cold sweat aligns with what the Inner Canon states, that when Yin prevails, the body is cold and sweating occurs, with clear fluid on the surface. This is not merely about spontaneous sweating; it applies to night sweats as well.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The meaning of sweating due to heat relates to the external manifestation of conditions like typhoid fever, where perspiration occurs due to internal heat. However, one must also consider the severity of the condition; excessive heat can harm the body and transform water into coolness. There are instances where fire from the kidneys carries water and turns into coolness, which must be carefully assessed. </p>
<p>According to Cheng Wuji in the “Essentials of the Golden Cabinet,” it is said that people with weak and thin pulses are prone to spontaneous sweating. Additionally, Chao’s “Sources of Illness” states that spontaneous sweating in those with chronic weakness is caused by Yang deficiency, thus implying that all instances of spontaneous sweating stem from a lack of Yang. However, if we refer back to the “Essentials of the Golden Cabinet,” a weak pulse indicates a deficiency in Yang qi, while a thin pulse indicates a deficiency in Yin qi. Why is it that only Yang is emphasized while Yin is neglected? This is a significant oversight of the learned.</p>
<p>Moreover, the illness of chronic weakness can arise in several ways: from a major illness where Yin qi hasn’t recovered and residual heat lingers; from labor or the desires tied to the seven emotions, which deplete Yin essence; or from foods and medicines that generate internal heat, all of which can harm Yin blood and exhaust the body’s energy. When Yin qi is deficient, it cannot support Yang, hence Yang qi evaporates internally, leading to persistent excessive sweating—this allows the Yang to survive without dispersing. </p>
<p>Ancient and Modern Comprehensive Medical Collection, Volume 279</p>
<p>Sweat Door</p>
<p>&quot;Complete Works of Jing Yue&quot; by Zhang Jiebin (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Discussion on Spontaneous and Excessive Sweating<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The condition of sweating can be categorized into two types: spontaneous sweating and night sweats. Spontaneous sweating occurs continuously without a specific time and increases with movement. Night sweats happen when the body sweats profusely during sleep and gradually subsides upon waking. Ancient texts suggest that spontaneous sweating is related to yang deficiency, where the protective layer is not secure. The body&#39;s protective energy (wei qi) should solidify the surface; if it is not secure, the surface weakens, leading to spontaneous sweating as fluids are expelled. The treatment should focus on strengthening the surface and supplementing yang.</p>
<p>On the other hand, night sweats are associated with yin deficiency. When yin is deficient, yang must compensate, which causes the yang to steam the yin components, leading to heat in the blood. When the blood is hot, fluids leak out as night sweats, thus the treatment should clear heat and replenish yin. This is the fundamental principle that should not be overlooked. However, from my observations, spontaneous sweating can also arise from yin deficiency, and night sweats may often indicate yang deficiency. For instance, when one experiences excessive heat or fatigue, spontaneous sweating is most common. Factors such as the heat generated from food in the stomach, fatigue-related heat from the spleen, and heat from alcohol and sexual activities can all cause spontaneous sweating. In such cases, can this be anything but a sign of excessive yang and declining yin?</p>
<p>Additionally, a person&#39;s sleep and wakefulness are influenced by the flow of protective energy, which is yang energy. During sleep, this energy enters the yin aspects; hence, this is a time when the surface is not yang-deficient. Therefore, both spontaneous sweating and night sweats each have signs of yin and yang, and one cannot simply conclude that spontaneous sweating is always a result of yang deficiency, nor that night sweats are always due to yin deficiency. </p>
<p>So, how do we discern the differences in yin and yang? The answer lies in observing the presence or absence of heat; whether it is yin or yang can be discerned this way. If sweating occurs due to excessive heat, it indicates that heat is consuming the yin, making yin deficiency evident.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Those who sweat without heat show that their qi is not stable, and their yang is deficient; this is evident. Understanding these two aspects, the essence of sweating becomes clear, and the methods for treatment can also be outlined. </p>
<p>Sweat originates from blood, which is based on yin. The classics say: the sweat of yang is named after the rain of heaven and earth; its meaning is understandable. However, sweat emerges from yin and is discharged through yang. Its root is the ying qi from within yin, while its opening and closing are governed by the wei qi of yang. Therefore, anyone wishing to promote sweating without understanding the rise and fall of ying and wei, or intending to prevent sweating without knowing the male and female aspects of the locking key, is akin to rowing a boat on land and driving a cart on the sea; I know they are bound to fail.</p>
<p>Sweating symptoms are categorized by yin and yang. Yang sweat is hot sweat; yin sweat is cold sweat. People only know that heat can induce sweating, but they do not realize that cold can also cause sweating.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>The so-called coldness is not merely external cold; it arises from an internal deficiency of yang energy, leading to coldness emerging from within. When there is no yang in the yin, the yin has nothing to govern, causing sweat to escape with the qi. Therefore, whenever there is great shock or fear, it can lead to sweating; this is a sign of sudden depletion of yang energy and loss of true essence. In severe cases, such as after illness, childbirth, or significant vomiting, diarrhea, or blood loss, sweating often occurs—this is indeed a result of qi departing. Hence, the classics state: when yin prevails, the body becomes cold and sweaty, the body remains clear yet feels chilly, often shivering and resulting in cold extremities, which can lead to fullness in the abdomen and death. Zhongjing said: extreme cold can provoke sweating, and the body will be as cold as ice; this is all referred to as yin sweat. Thus, in treating yin sweat, one should simply observe the degree of qi deficiency. If the deficiency is slight, slightly support the vital energy, and the sweat will naturally cease; if the deficiency is severe, it is essential to urgently restore the vital energy, using substances like ginger, cinnamon, and aconite, which must be employed.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Conditions Not to Treat</strong></p>
<p>There are six conditions of sweating that should not be treated: First, sweating with severe wheezing should not be treated; second, sweating with a weak pulse should not be treated; third, sweating with severe bodily pain should not be treated; fourth, sweating leading to a wet forehead should not be treated; fifth, sweating like oil should not be treated; sixth, sweating like pearls should not be treated. In any of these cases, one must not recklessly use medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For Yang conditions with sweating or night sweats, one should observe the pulse and symptoms for signs of fire, such as night heat with thirst, or a preference for cold with hot stools; these indicate a Yang excess and Yin deficiency. The first choice for treatment should be the Gui Gui Liu Huang Tang, and the Bai Yin Jian is also effective. If there is a slight fire in the Yin aspect but not severe, one should use the Yi Yin Jian, or modify the Yi Yin Jian as necessary. If there is unrest from heart fire, leading to irritability and sweating, one should treat with Zhu Sha An Shen Wan, Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, or Sheng Mai San. Additionally, if the sweating is not due to Yin deficiency but rather from internal fire and blood heat, one should use the Zheng Qi Tang, or Huang Qin Shao Yao Tang, or Qing Hua Yin. For Yin conditions with sweating or night sweats, if there is no internal fire and no fiery pulse, it simply indicates Qi deficiency. In Yin conditions, one should not recklessly use cooling medicines, as they can harm the Yang energy.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>If sweating is caused by deficiency of qi while the fire is not yet diminished, one should use formulas like San Yin Jian, Shen Gui Tang, or Ren Shen Jian Zhong Tang. If there is sleeping night sweat without fire, one should use formulas like Shen Ling San or Du Shen Tang. If both yang and qi are deficient, formulas like Shen Fu Tang or Da Jian Zhong Tang should be used. If qi is deficient and fire has severely diminished, one should employ formulas like Da Bu Yuan Jian or Liu Wei Hui Yang Yin. If the defensive qi is not secure, and the pores are not tightly sealed, leading to easy sweating, this also belongs to the category of yin syndromes, and one should use formulas such as Huang Qi Liu Yi Tang, Yu Ping Feng San, or Qi Fu Tang. </p>
<p>Mismanagement of various illnesses may lead to inappropriate sweating or excessive sweating, even if the sweating is appropriate. Excessive sweating causes the departure of yang, which also belongs to yin syndromes; one must assess the degree of deficiency. For mild deficiency, use formulas like San Yin Jian, Wu Yin Jian, or Du Shen Tang; for severe deficiency, one must not use anything but Da Bu Yuan Jian or Liu Wei Hui Yang Yin. </p>
<p>Dampness affecting the spleen can also cause sweating.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>If there is a heavy feeling in the body accompanied by fatigue, and the pulse is slow and large, with a voice that sounds as if coming from a jar, it mostly indicates a condition of dampness. If there is excess heat with dampness, removing the heat will naturally clear the dampness, and one should use the methods suitable for Yang disorders; if there is excess cold with dampness, aiding the fire will naturally dispel the dampness, and one should use the methods suitable for Yin disorders. In some cases, along with the above, formulas like Yao Ping Feng San, Si Jun Zi Tang, or Wu Jun Zi Jian can be used to strengthen the spleen&#39;s Earth energy, thus helping to eliminate dampness and allowing sweat to gather naturally. </p>
<p>For stopping or regulating sweat, agents such as Ma Huang Gen, Fu Xiao Mai, Wu Mei, Bei Wu Wei, Xiao Hei Dou, Long Gu, and Mu Li may be selected as needed. </p>
<p>It is said: when Huang Qi is paired with Fang Feng, its power is enhanced. It is also noted that Gui Pi (Cinnamon) is especially effective for solidifying the surface.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>If sweating excessively cannot be controlled, one should quickly use five centipedes as a powder, mix with saliva to fill the navel, and bind it securely with cloth; it will stop after one night. Alternatively, powdered He Shou Wu can be used to fill the navel and bind it, which will also stop the sweating.</p>
<p>For children with night sweats, although it is common, many experts in Dongyuan say it does not need to be treated, as it is due to insufficient blood and energy. Nevertheless, excessive sweating is ultimately a sign of a deficiency in qi. I often see children who sweat profusely and prescribe about ten grams of ginseng boiled in soup for them to drink; it will stop the sweating that night. I worry that their future vitality may not be strong because of this, so nurturing and replenishing is essential.</p>
<p>For excessive sweating after illness, whether from cold or malaria, if it is associated with external cold pathogens, sweating occurs while the heat subsides and does not stop immediately; this is due to the initial resolution of exterior pathogens, and sweat should be expected. If it persists for several days, there is no harm. Once the protective qi becomes stronger, sweating will naturally stop, and there is nothing to worry about. However, for other mixed symptoms not caused by external pathogens that result in spontaneous or night sweats, treatment is necessary and should not be neglected.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Sweating and Chills</strong></p>
<p>Sweating and chills are different; sweating arises from the external, while chills come from the internal. When someone with a cold wants to relieve it, if their vital energy is strong internally, then the evil cannot compete with it. However, when sweating occurs without effort, this is known as non-battle, indicating that the body is not deficient. If a person is inherently weak, and the evil struggles with the righteous, the minor symptoms would cause chills, while severe cases lead to sweating. If the righteous overcomes the evil, then sweating will resolve the condition. Therefore, any struggle between the evil and the righteous occurring externally is called a battle, indicating recovery; while a struggle between evil and righteous internally results in chills, which is more severe. It is said: When the evil dominates within, there must be chills. Sweating signifies the restoration of vital energy, while chills indicate that evil energy is rampant. Thus, if someone suffers from a cold for six to seven days and only experiences chills without sweating, they may develop a reverse cold condition that is very hard to treat. This results from weakness in vital energy and the internal dominance of yin evil, where the righteous do not overcome the evil, leading to the evil prevailing instead. In such cases, it is essential to use powerful warming tonics and rescue yang methods, among others; how else can one counter it?<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Head Sweating</strong></p>
<p>There are two conditions for head sweating: one is due to evil heat obstructing upward, and the other is the internal loss of yang energy. The head is where all yang energies converge. When someone suffers from full-body sweating due to a cold, it is referred to as heat spreading upwards. If there is no sweating from the body, the heat does not disperse and rises to disturb the yang aspect, resulting in only head sweating. The treatment for heat steaming can be either purifying or dispersing; in severe cases, purgation may be needed to eliminate the heat and allow the condition to resolve itself. In the case of energy loss, it is often due to reckless purgation injuring the yin, excessive depletion, or continuous diarrhea, leading to the exhaustion of yin below and the loss of yang above. When there is difficulty in urination and head sweating occurs, it signals great danger.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For head sweating with a tight and rapid pulse, indicating an exterior evil that should be dispersed, Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) is appropriate, or Chai Hu Gui Zhi Gan Jiang Tang (Bupleurum and Cinnamon Twig Decoction) and various new formulas with Chai Hu can also be used as needed. If there is a fire evil, with a broad and slippery pulse and internal fever, head sweating should be cleared with Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang (Ginseng Powdered White Tiger Decoction) or Yi Yuan San (Benefit Source Powder). If there is water retention in the chest, with fullness under the heart and head sweating, either Da Xian Xiong Tang (Major Sinking Chest Decoction) or Xiao Ban Xia Fu Ling Tang (Minor Pinellia and Poria Decoction) can be used. If there are hard stools, abdominal distension, pain, and head sweating, Cheng Qi Tang (Regulate Qi Decoction) is indicated. For various forms of deficiency, diarrhea, and head sweating with yang loss, Du Shen Tang (Ginseng Decoction) or Da Bu Yuan Jian (Greatly Tonifying Source Decoction) and Liu Wei Hui Yang (Six-Ingredient Restore Yang Decoction) can serve as emergency remedies. This may help preserve life.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The Illness of Great Sweating</p>
<p>When a person suffers from great sweating, the yang energy dissipates alongside the sweat. If not urgently restrained, the yang energy will scatter, resulting in immediate death. The remedy should consist of a potent restorative decoction. If the vital energy is preserved, the excessive sweating can be stopped. One should use one ounce of ginseng, or replace it with two ounces of astragalus; one ounce of angelica, one-tenth of an ounce of North Schisandra berries, and seven pieces of mulberry leaves, and decoct this urgently for consumption. This formula is a variation of the Blood Supplementing Decoction, notable for having more Qi-tonifying herbs than blood-nourishing ones, allowing the Qi to flourish so that the blood can be generated. With the blood generated, sweating can cease. Furthermore, the inclusion of Schisandra berries helps to retain sweat, just as mulberry leaves help to stop sweating; there are complementary benefits here. </p>
<p>However, in the case of someone experiencing great sweating, the breath must be labored; one cannot simply increase Qi with ginseng and astragalus heavily. Purely relying on blood-replenishing substances will yield limited results. Yet blood cannot be generated abruptly, and the urgent need is for the Qi. Ignoring the Qi and solely focusing on replenishing the blood will not yield success. This distinction must be urgently made.</p>
<p>In general, whether a person is ill or not, if they suddenly sweat profusely and cannot stop, it is termed loss of yang. Once sweat has ceased but there remains some vital energy, it indicates a critical condition.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>If sweating arises and one uses medicine to stop the sweat, then the sweating cannot be stopped. If sweating is excessive and one uses blood-tonifying medicine, then blood will not quickly regenerate. The urgent matter is to replenish the qi, which can still be restored. However, among qi-tonifying medicines, ginseng truly cannot be substituted for anything else. One should use the Sweat-Collecting and Yang-Replenishing Decoction, which includes one tael each of ginseng, astragalus, ophiopogon, and cooked rehmannia, three qian of north five-flavor fruit, five qian each of angelica and roasted jujube seed, and one qian of licorice, boiled in water to take. After one dose, the sweating will cease; after two doses, the qi will be restored; after three doses, the qi will be vigorous; after four doses, the body will be healthy. The essence of this formula lies in the balanced replenishment of qi and blood, especially focusing on qi, which provides enough energy to generate yang. When yang is abundant, yin will also be produced. In cases of yang deficiency, although yang is lost, in fact, it is due to yin deficiency that cannot contain yang, resulting in the loss of yang qi. If yin were sufficient to contain yang, then even if sweating occurs, there would be no loss of yang. However, in treating yang deficiency, how can one only seek to restore yang? One must restore both yang and yin. </p>
<p>Profuse sweating necessitates the use of qi-tonifying medicine to rescue the condition of yang deficiency. However, if qi-tonifying medicine is overused, there is still a fear that yang will become exuberant while yin dissipates. After taking several doses of qi-tonifying medicine, it is advisable to shift to tonifying yin products. Moreover, after the loss of yang, yin and blood are indeed depleted, so providing water-tonifying medicine corresponds perfectly to this situation. When yin is stabilized, yang will flourish, eliminating the issue of one side being overly dominant.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Head Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When a person&#39;s head sweats, it is due to an excess of kidney fire and a deficiency of kidney water. If one does not understand the reason and merely uses sweat-stopping medicines, it will surely lead to dizziness and ear pain. The method should be to nourish the kidneys and clear the source of lung transformation, which will naturally be effective. The prescription includes one pound of mulberry leaves, two pounds of cooked rehmannia, three taels of north five-flavor herb, and six taels of ophiopogon, all ground into powder, then formed into pills with honey. Take five qian or one liang daily with hot water, and after a month, sweating will cease forever.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is excessive head sweating during meals, it is due to excess stomach fire rather than residual kidney fire. The method here should incorporate one pound each of scrophularia, ophiopogon, tian dong, and raw rehmannia, four taels of north five-flavor herb, and half a pound of sour jujube seed, all ground into powder and formed into pills with honey. Take one liang daily with hot water, and one will certainly recover within two months.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>It seems that stomach fire is somewhat dominant, and bamboo leaf gypsum decoction is recommended, but why do I prefer not to use it? It is because the stomach fire is only slightly elevated, not intensely raging and fiery, merely because of the flavors from food entering the stomach, leading to slight perspiration. Once the meal is finished, the sweating also ceases. Therefore, resolving it with just a single ingredient like Scrophularia is sufficient. Furthermore, using ingredients like Tianma, two types of Dong, to clear lung fire, and Shengdi to cool the blood, as well as Suanzaoren to calm heart fire and Wuweizi to control sweating and nourish fluids, will also diminish the stomach&#39;s fiery state, especially since it was not excessively strong to begin with. This is one method of moderation. The sweat from the hands is a minor issue, and there&#39;s no need to involve this treatment; washing them with water would suffice. </p>
<p>For the hand sweating, one would use one ounce each of Astragalus and Kudzu, and three qian each of Schizonepeta and Ledebouriella, boiling them in water to prepare a basin of decoction, then steaming and washing the hands three times while warm, which will eliminate the sweat—a marvelous remedy. This decoction can be used this way, but it is even better to change the herbs daily.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong><br>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: one should not pierce when there is excessive sweat. Excessive sweat indicates that evil has settled in the skin and flesh. For those suffering from bone chill and heat, the disease has nowhere to settle, and the sweat pours out continuously, leading to dry teeth. One should target the Shaoyin channels in the inner thigh. Once the teeth are dry, it&#39;s beyond cure. The same applies to bone qi stagnation.<br>For diseases starting in the arms, one should first target the Yangming and Taiyin points to induce sweating. For diseases starting in the head, one targets the Taiyang. For diseases starting in the legs, one targets the Yangming of the feet. The Taiyin of the arms can induce sweating, as can the Yangming of the feet. Thus, one should target the yin to induce sweat, and for severe cases, stop at the yang; target the yang to induce sweat, and for severe cases, stop at the yin.<br>In cases of febrile illness where sweating has occurred but the pulse remains restless, and there is panting along with continued heat, do not pierce the skin. Severe panting leads to death.<br>In a febrile illness with sweating and a steady pulse, one can induce sweat by targeting the fish border, Taiyuan, Dadu, and Taibai points.

<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states that for spontaneous and nocturnal sweating, one should first focus on the navel, envisioning fire circulating within, then cover the navel with the hands while imagining a stream of water descending from the navel, moving down to the bladder and tips of the tailbone, and then to the back, emerging from the heart to cleanse it. There is no need to use the method of guiding water under the navel if there is no loss of essence. Spontaneous sweating without cause is a result of excessive heat; hence, one must lower the fire and elevate the water to stop the sweating.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot;: In April of the Ren Yin year, Zhang Yun experienced cold and rainy weather mixed with dampness. Poor diet and excessive labor due to official matters resulted in an illness that led to prolonged sweating. After recovery, he continued to sweat without stopping for several days and felt severe chills, demanding thicker clothing. He experienced tightness in the chest, restlessness, intermittent fever, dizziness, and food reduction. This was due to excessive external Yin fire from the stomach, compounded by moist heat from the rain, which intensified the accumulation of moist heat, resulting in persistent sweating. Furthermore, a wind pathogen coupled with the elements of the eastern auspicious direction contributed to his condition. Wind herbs were used to alleviate dryness, and sweet herbs were used to purge heat. The Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction was the main prescription, and just one dose alleviated all symptoms.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure&quot; states: In the 46th year of age, Duke Wu of Zhen Ding, during the third month of the Bingzi year of the Yuan dynasty, fell ill due to worry and overwork, resulting in irregular eating habits. His limbs were cold, and his breath was cool in his mouth and nose. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead, and he often felt dizzy, with his six pulses thin like a spider&#39;s thread. One physician diagnosed a wind condition and attempted to treat it with a wind-dispersing powder. I recalled that in Qian&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Children,&quot; it was mentioned that a child&#39;s internal injury to the spleen and stomach could lead to either vomiting or diarrhea, and if prolonged, wind evil could invade the stomach, causing diarrhea and a bound condition. This might lead to lingering surprise, thus the wind-dispersing powder would expel the wind evil. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that prolonged wind can cause diarrhea—that is exactly the case. Now, with Duke Wu&#39;s physical symptoms, it is a condition of excessive Yin and deficient Yang, and bitter-cold medicines are not appropriate. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says that excessive Yin leads to profuse sweating and coldness. Moreover, the treatise on the correspondence between Yin and Yang states that when Yin is excessive, the body becomes cold, sweating occurs, the body feels persistently cool, and one experiences chills. Coldness causes dysfunction. The &quot;Regulation of the Menstrual Cycle&quot; also states that excessive Yin generates internal cold. Qi Bo said that reverse Qi rises and cold accumulates in the chest without relieving itself; if it does not relieve, warm Qi leaves, and cold remains, thus causing internal cold. Dongyuan explains that this indicates insufficient spleen and stomach energy due to overwork, leading to illness in the middle burner, transmitting cold inward, and thus only yang should be supplemented. Therefore, I prescribed the &quot;Li Zhong Decoction&quot; with added black aconite, taking five qian for each dose, and recommended the broth of lamb cooked with scallions, taking one large cup of the clear juice to mix and consume. By evening, his limbs gradually warmed, and he perspired slightly. Late at night, he took a second dose, and by the next day, his spirit was restored, with six pulses strong; after several doses, he was cured.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>The son-in-law of the Vice Minister of Justice, Wang Lifu, was twenty-five years old. In the eleventh month of the 丁卯 year of the Yuan dynasty, due to labor and worries, he became ill from stress, losing his appetite and adversely affecting his health. He experienced restlessness, a feverish body, fatigue in his limbs, and profuse sweating that soaked his blankets. He had no desire to eat, his breath was weak, and his complexion was pale and yellow. I was asked to treat him and he provided details of his previous conditions. Upon examining his pulse, it was floating, rapid, and short, with two inches very small. I warned that this was a dangerous condition; although treatment might be simple, he would surely die by spring, and I advised his in-laws to be aware of this. The lady did not believe it and subsequently changed doctors. By the first month, he succumbed to his illness due to heat and distress. On another day, Lifu came with an official named Zhang Jiefu and said to me: &quot;Our son-in-law turned out to be as you said; I wish to understand the rationale.&quot; I replied: &quot;This is not difficult to comprehend.&quot;<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says: The master prevails over the inverse, while the guest prevails in acquiescence; this is the way of Heaven. Indeed, the seasons are the guest, while the human body is the master. During the three months of winter, everyone fears the cold, yet there are those who are restless and hot, sweating excessively. This causes their Yang to not be firmly retained, and the season cannot overcome their heat. If even the time and seasons cannot be controlled, how can medicine help? Winter is the month of closure and storage. The Yang energy should lie dormant beneath the nine springs until spring arrives with thunder, stirring everything into movement, which is the way of nurturing life. If the winter storage is not secure, then the spring growth will be weak, leading to epidemics and calamities. Moreover, the Yang energy of the human body should also lie dormant within, not to be recklessly disturbed, nor should the skin be allowed to leak, causing Qi to be rapidly depleted; this is the response to winter storage. Allowing sweat to flow during the month of closure and storage means the kidney water has already dried up; how can life flourish in spring? If the Yang energy within is severed, there is nothing to nourish and flourish—how can one survive? The two gentlemen then sighed and departed.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The &quot;Treatise on Medicine&quot; states: At Shanghu, Lu Junwen developed symptoms of internal injury with deficiency, experiencing fever and spontaneous sweating that continuously poured down like rain. After taking the Tonifying Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction for over ten doses without effect, I modified the prescription. Each dose included one and a half qian of honey-prepared astragalus, one qian of ginseng, seven fen each of white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, and licorice, one qian each of angelica and white peony, one fen each of bupleurum and haritaki, along with three fen of cinnamon twig, seven fen of ephedra root, a pinch of floating wheat, and three fen of processed aconite. After three doses, the sweating stopped, the fever retreated, and he felt at ease.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Compendium&quot; states: A man experienced sweating in his hands and feet, and despite the doctor&#39;s use of bitter herbs like coptis, scutellaria, and others in addition to tonics, there was no effect. His foot sweating was particularly excessive, so later, a prescription consisting of Eight Treasures, complemented by half of something and poria as the sovereign, along with white aconite and chuanwu as aides, successfully eliminated the sweating.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>The &quot;Case Studies of Xue Ji&quot; states: A scholar exerted himself greatly, and due to irregularities in diet, experienced bloody stools, which were either red or dark. After half a year, if not blood in the stools, then there was night sweating; if not experiencing cold chills, then there was fever. The two treatments of blood and sweat had no effect; the six pulses were floating and large, while the heart and spleen were depleted. This resulted from overthinking, which harmed the heart and spleen, causing an inability to contain blood and restore it to its source. However, blood is indeed sweat, and sweat is blood; their colors, red and dark, indicate minor or severe fluctuations of fire. Chills and fever indicated a deficiency of both qi and blood. Thus, in the morning, I employed a restorative formula to tonify the middle and augment qi, aiming to strengthen the source of the spleen and lungs and lift the sinking qi; in the afternoon, I used Gui Pi (Return the Spleen) with black and five flavors, to nourish the blood of the heart and spleen, consolidating the dispersed fluids. Within two months, all symptoms completely resolved.</p>
<p>Xia Bao Gu Ren, aged sixty-one, after suffering from dysentery, experienced involuntary semen leakage for two days before it ceased. Moreover, after exertions in intimacy, he caught a chill and became angry, which led to the onset of chills and fever, pain in the right side radiating to the chest, abdominal distension, spontaneous sweating, and night sweats like rain, with his limbs feeling cold and experiencing frightful waking moments, sometimes feeling as though rising like floating or sinking like falling, which led to insomnia. Using two doses of tonifying medicine further aggravated the condition; his pulse was floating, large, and rapid, but when examined, it was weak and thin. This indicated a fire-less, deficient heat, so I urgently prescribed a formula of Ten Complete Powders, adding dioscorea, dogwood, peony, and prepared aconite, after which all symptoms suddenly improved and he was restored to health. Such vitality is exceptionally rare.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>A scholar suffered from a dry mouth and fever, frequent and turbid urination, constipation, nocturnal sweating, and nocturnal emissions, which led to insomnia.

After taking a decoction of Shiquan Dabu Decoction along with the previous pill for over a month, he was completely cured. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue,&quot; it says: I once treated an elderly man over seventy who suddenly suffered from a cold infection. Initially, I used warming and tonifying methods. After ten days, when his vital energy was about to recover, he unexpectedly had a gastrointestinal crisis—fighting violently from dawn until 9 AM without being able to sweat, experiencing severe chills and danger, and urgently called for me. I administered Liuwei Huayang Decoction with one tael of ginseng and three qian each of ginger and aconite, making him take it as a brew. After a brief time, he broke out in sweat, as if bathed. By noon, he was drenched in sweat and could hardly recover, feeling cold as if he were dead, with almost no breath. I was informed of this again. I commanded that the previous medicine be brewed again for him, but the messenger said: &quot;He has already sweated profusely from this medicine; can he endure more sweating with another dose?&quot; I laughed and said: &quot;There is a principle in this that you do not understand.&quot; I insisted on administering it again, and this led to the cessation of sweating and the recovery of his spirit. Within a few days, he was up and about. Alas! Using this method to induce sweating and to subsequently stop sweating may lead people to doubt its efficacy. However, they do not realize that both the emergence and cessation of sweat are controlled by the vital energy. Therefore, I record this to allow people to understand that the power of contraction and expansion does not lie merely in the ability to release or retrieve but in what governs it.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　黄帝曰：人之善病风厥漉汗者，何以候之？少俞答曰：肉不坚，腠理疏，则善病风。黄帝曰：何以候肉之不坚也？少俞答曰：腘肉不坚而无分理。理者粗理。粗理而皮不致者，腠理疏，此言其浑然者。　　 【注　盖津液充于皮腠之间，皮溃理疏，则津泄而为汗矣。太阳之气主皮肤，如腘肉不坚，理粗而皮不致密，则腠理疏而浑然汗出矣。】<br>　　　　　五禁篇</p>

<p>　　伤寒无汗者七证，自汗者九证。太阳伤寒、刚痓病、太阴病、少阴病、厥阴病、阴阳易病、冬阳明病，皆无汗。汗出者九证，卫不和、伤风、风温、中湿、中暑、阳明病、亡阳、柔痓、霍乱，皆自汗。虽然，少阴不得有汗，而少阴亦有反自汗出之证；阳明病法多汗，而阳明亦有反无汗之证，不可不察也。　　问：头汗出。曰：病人表实里虚，元府不开，则阳气上出，汗见于头。凡头汗出者，五内干枯，胞中空虚，津液少也，慎不可下。下之者，谓之重虚。然头汗出者有数证。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>伤寒五六日，头汗出，微恶寒，手足冷，心下满，口不欲食，大便鞕，脉细者，此为阳微结，必有表复有里也。脉沉亦有里也。汗出为阳微，假令纯阴结，不得复有外证，悉入在里，此为半在里半在外也。脉虽沉紧，不得为少阴病，所以然者，阴不得有汗，今头汗出，故知非少阴也。　　伤寒五六日，已汗下，胸胁满，微结，小便不利，渴而不呕，但头汗出，往来寒热心烦者，此表未解也，病人但为瘀热在里，身必发黄。　　阳明病下之，其外有热，手足温，不结胸，心中懊憹，饥不能食，但头汗出者。　　心下紧满，无大热，头汗出者。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>　　阳明病下血讝语者，为热入血室，但头汗出者，刺期门，随其实而泻之，汗出则愈。<br>　　　　明理论 【金　成无己】</p>
<p>　　　　　自汗</p>
<p>　　伤寒自汗，何以明之？自汗者，谓不因发散而自然汗出者是也。《内经》曰：阳气卫外而为固也。卫为阳，言卫护皮肤，肥实腠理，禁固津液，不得妄泄。汗者干之，而出邪气。干于卫气，气不能卫固于外，则皮肤为之缓，腠理为之疏，由是而津液妄泄，濈濈然润，漐漐然出，谓之自汗也。如发热自汗出而不愈，此卫气不和，风邪干于卫也；太阳中暍，汗出恶寒，身热而渴者，暑邪干于卫也；多汗出而濡，此其风湿甚者，湿邪干于卫也。是知卫气固护津液，不令妄泄，必为邪气干之而始出也。风寒暑湿之毒为四时之气，中人即为伤寒。风与暑湿为邪，皆令自汗。惟寒邪伤人，独不汗出。寒伤荣而不伤卫，卫无邪气所干，则皮腠得以密，津液得以固，是以汗不出也。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>及其气渐入里，传而为热，则亦使自汗出也。盖热则荣卫通，腠理开，而汗泄矣。然自汗之证，又有表里之别，虚实之异焉。若汗出恶风及微恶寒者，皆表未解也，必待发散而后愈。至于漏不止而恶风，及发汗后恶寒者，又皆表之虚也，必待温经而后愈。诸如此皆邪气在表也。若汗出不恶寒者，此为表解而里未和也。经曰：阳明发热汗出，此为热越。又曰：阳明病发热汗多者，急下之。又非若邪气在表而汗出之可缓也。伤寒自汗之证为常也。设或汗出发润，与其出之如油，或大如贯珠，若身出而不流，皆为不治之证也。必手足俱周，遍身悉润，漐漐然一时间许，烦热已而身凉和，乃为佳矣。此则阴阳气和，水升火降，荣卫通流，邪气出而解者也。《内经》曰：阳之汗，以天地之雨名之。此之谓也。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>　　　　　盗汗</p>
<p>　　伤寒盗汗，何以明之？盗汗者，谓睡而汗出者也。自汗则或睡与不睡，自然而出也。盗汗者，不睡则不能汗出，方其睡也，凑凑然出焉，觉则止而不复出矣。杂病盗汗者，责其阳虚也。伤寒盗汗者，非若杂病之虚，是由邪气在半表半里使然也。何者？若邪气一切在表，干于卫则自然汗出也。此则邪气侵行于里，外连于表邪，及睡则卫气行于里，乘表中阳气不致，津液得泄，故但睡而汗出，觉则气散于表而汗止矣。经云：微盗汗出反恶寒者，表未解也。又阳明病当作里实，而脉浮者云必盗汗，是犹有表邪故也。又三阳合病，目合自汗。是知盗汗为邪气在半表半里之间明矣。且自汗有为之虚者，有为之实者。其于盗汗之证，非若由汗有实者，悉当和表而已，不可不知也。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>　　　　　头汗</p>

<p>　　汗出一证，有自汗者，有盗汗者。自汗者，濈濈然无时，而动作则益甚。盗汗者，寐中通身汗出，觉来渐收。诸古法云：自汗者属阳虚，腠理不固，卫气之所司也。人以卫气固其表，卫气不固，则表虚自汗，而津液为之发泄也，治宜实表补阳。盗汗者属阴虚，阴虚者阳必凑之，故阳蒸阴分则血热，血热则液泄而为盗汗也，治宜清火补阴。此其大法，固亦不可不知也。然以余观之，则自汗亦有阴虚，盗汗亦多阳虚也。如遇烦劳大热之类，最多自汗。故或以饮食之火起于胃，劳倦之火起于脾，酒色之火起于肾，皆能令人自汗，若此者，谓非阳盛阴衰者而何？又若人之寤寐，总由卫气之出入，卫气者，阳气也，人于寐时，则卫气入于阴分，此其时非阳虚于表者而何？所以自汗盗汗，亦各有阴阳之证，不得谓自汗必属阳虚，盗汗必属阴虚也。然则阴阳有异，何以辨之？曰：但察其有火无火，则或阴或阳，自可见矣。盖火胜而汗出者，以火烁阴，阴虚可知也。<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>无火而汗出者，以表气不固，阳虚可知也。知斯二者，则汗出之要无余义，而治之之法，亦可得其纲领矣。　　汗由血液，本乎阴也。经曰：阳之汗，以天地之雨名之。其义可知。然汗发于阴而出于阳，此其根本则由阴中之营气，而其启闭则由阳中之卫气，故凡欲疏汗而不知营卫之盛衰，欲禁汗而不知橐钥之牝牡，亦犹荡舟于陆，而驾车于海耳，吾知其必败也。　　汗证有阴阳。阳汗者，热汗也；阴汗者，冷汗也。人但知热能致汗，而不知寒亦致汗。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>所谓寒者，非曰外寒，正以阳气内虚，则寒生于中，而阴中无阳，则阴无所主，而汗随气泄。故凡大惊恐惧，皆能令人汗出，是皆阳气顿消，真元失守之兆。至其甚者，则如病后产后，或大吐泻失血之后，必多有汗出者，是岂非气去而然乎？故经曰：阴胜则身寒汗出，身常清，数栗而寒，寒则厥，厥则腹满死。仲景曰：极寒反汗出，身必冷如冰，是皆阴汗之谓也。故凡治阴汗者，但当察气虚之微甚。微虚者，略扶正气，其汗自收；甚虚者，非速救元气不可，即姜桂附子之属，必所当用。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>　　　　　不治证</p>
<p>　　凡汗出不治之证有六：一，汗出而喘甚者，不治；二，汗出而脉脱者，不治；三，汗出而身痛甚者，不治；四，汗出发润至巅者，不治；五，汗出如油者，不治；六，汗出如珠者，不治。凡见此类，不得妄为用药。<br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　阳证自汗或盗汗者，但察其脉证有火，或夜热烦渴，或便热喜冷之类，皆阳盛阴虚也，宜当归六黄汤为第一，保阴煎亦妙。其或阴分虽有微火而不甚者，宜一阴煎，或加减一阴煎之类主之。其有心火不宁，烦躁出汗者，宜朱砂安神丸、天王补心丹、生脉散之类主之。又有本非阴虚，只因内火熏蒸，血热而多汗者，宜正气汤，或黄芩芍药汤、清化饮之类主之。　　阴证自汗或盗汗者，但察其内无火邪，又无火脉，便是气虚。阴证皆不可妄用凉药以败阳气。<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>若止因气虚而火未衰者，宜三阴煎、参归汤、人参建中汤之类主之。若睡中盗汗而无火者，宜参苓散、独参汤主之。若阳气俱虚者，宜参附汤、大建中汤之类主之。若气虚火衰之甚者，宜大补元煎、六味回阳饮之类主之。卫气不固，腠理不密而易汗者，是亦阴证之属，宜黄芪六一汤、玉屏风散、芪附汤之类主之。　　诸病误治，有不当汗而妄汗，或虽当汗而汗之太过者，皆汗多亡阳之证，是亦阴证之属，当察其虚之微甚。微虚者，宜三阴煎、五阴煎、独参汤之类主之；大虚者，非大补元煎、六味回阳饮之类不可。　　湿气乘脾者，亦能作汗。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>凡证有身重困倦，而脉见缓大，声音如从瓮中出者，多属湿证。若热湿胜者，但去其火而湿自清，宜用前阳证之法；寒湿胜者，但助其火而湿自退，宜用前阴证之法。或用玉屏风散、四君子汤、五君子煎之类，以健脾土之气，则湿去而汗自收。　　收汗止汗之剂，如麻黄根、浮小麦、乌梅、北五味、小黑豆、龙骨、牡蛎之属，皆可随宜择用。　　一曰：黄芪得防风而力愈大。一曰：官桂最能实表。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>　　凡汗出太多不能收者，速宜用五倍子为末，以唾津调填脐中，外用帕帛缚定，过宿即止；或用何首乌为末，填脐缚之亦止。　　小儿盗汗，虽是常事，在东垣诸公皆曰，不必治之，盖由血气未足也。然汗之太多者，终属气分之虚。余于儿辈见汗之甚者，每以人参一钱许，煎汤与服，当夜即止。正恐他日之强弱，未必不由乎此，所以培补之功，原不可少。　　病后多汗，若伤寒，若疟疾，凡系外感寒邪，汗出热退而有汗不即止者，此以表邪初解，必由腠理，卫气开泄，其汗宜然。即数日旬日，亦自无妨。俟卫气渐实，汗必自止，无足虑也。若其他杂证，本非外感之解而有自汗盗汗者，乃非所宜，不容不治。<a id="orig-51p" href="#trans-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>　　　　　战汗</p>
<p>　　战与栗异，战由乎外，栗由乎内也。凡伤寒欲解，将汗之时，若其正气内实，邪不能与之争，但汗出自不作战，所谓不战，应知体不虚也。若其人本虚，邪与正争，微者为振，甚则为战，正胜邪则战而汗解矣。故凡邪正之争于外者则为战，战，其愈者也；邪正之争于内者则为栗，栗，其甚者也。论曰：阴中于邪，必内栗也。夫战为正气将复，栗则邪气肆强，故伤寒六七日，有但栗不战，竟成寒逆者，多不可救，此以正气中虚，阴邪内盛，正不胜邪，而反为邪气所胜。凡遇此证，使非用大补温热之剂，及艾灼回阳等法，其他焉得而御之？<a id="orig-52p" href="#trans-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>　　　　　头汗</p>
<p>　　头汗之证有二：一为邪热上壅，一为阳气内脱也。盖头为诸阳之会，凡伤寒遍身得汗者，谓之热越。若身无汗，则热不得越而上蒸阳分，故但头汗出也。治热蒸者，可清可散，甚者可下，在去其热而病自愈。至若气脱一证，则多以妄下伤阴，或克伐太过，或泄泻不止，以致阴竭于下，则阳脱于上，小水不通，而上见头汗，则大危矣。<br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　头汗脉紧数，有表邪当散者，宜小柴胡汤，或柴胡桂枝干姜汤，及新方诸柴胡饮，俱可酌用。若有火邪，脉洪滑，内多烦热，头汗当清者，宜人参白虎汤、益元散之类主之。若水结胸，心下满，头汗出者，或大陷胸汤，或小半夏茯苓汤。若便结腹胀，疼痛头汗者，宜承气汤。若诸虚泄泻，阳脱头汗者，宜独参汤，或大补元煎、六味回阳等饮，作急救之。庶可保全。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】</p>
<p>　　　　　大汗</p>
<p>　　大汗之病，阳气尽随汗而外越，若不急为止抑，则阳气立散，即时身死。法当以大补之剂煎饮，一线之气可留，而大汗可止。方用人参一两，或黄芪二两代之，当归一两，北五味一钱，桑叶七片，急为煎服。此方即补血汤之变，妙在补气药多于补血，使气旺则血自生，血生则汗可止。况方中加五味子以收汗，如桑叶以止汗，有不相得益彰者乎？倘以大汗之人，气必大喘，不可以参芪重增其气，纯用补血之品，末为无见。然而血不可骤生，气所当急固，不顾气，徒补血，未见功成。此似是而非，又不可不急辨之也。　　凡人无论有病无病，一旦汗如雨出不肯止者，名曰亡阳。汗尽止有气未绝，最危之证也。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>若因汗出而用止汗之药则汗不能止，若因汗尽而用补血之药则血难骤生，所当急补其气，尚可挽回。然而补气之药，舍人参实无他物可代。方用收汗生阳汤，人参、黄芪、麦冬、熟地各一两，北五味三钱，当归、炒枣仁各五钱，甘草一钱，水煎服。一剂而汗收，再剂而气复，三剂而气旺，四剂而身健矣。此方之妙，妙在气血均补，而尤补于气，使气足以生阳，阳旺而阴亦生矣。夫亡阳之证，虽是阳亡，其实阴虚不能摄阳，以致阳气之亡也。倘阴足以摄阳，则汗虽出，何至亡阳？然治亡阳之证，乌可徒救阳乎？救阳兼救阴也。　　大汗势必用补气之药，以救亡阳之证，然而过用补气之药，仍恐阳旺而阴消，服数剂补气药后，即宜改用补阴之品。况亡阳之后，阴血正枯，进以补水之药，正投其所好也。阴定则阳生，阴阳无偏胜之弊矣。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>　　　　　头手汗</p>
<p>　　凡人头顶出汗，乃肾火有余而肾水不足。若不知其故，而徒用止汗之药，必致目昏而耳痛，法当滋其肾而清肺金之化源，自易奏功如向。方用桑叶一斤，熟地二斤，北五味三两，麦冬六两，各为末，蜜为丸，每日白滚水送下五钱或一两，一月后永不出汗矣。更有人每饭之时，头汗如雨落者，此又胃火胜而非肾火余也，法当用元参、麦冬、天冬、生地各一斤，北五味四两，酸枣仁半斤，各为末，蜜为丸，每日白滚水送下一两，二月必愈。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>似乎胃火胜，宜用竹叶石膏汤，而余偏不用者何也？盖胃火之胜者微胜耳，非若炽盛而火炎，奔腾而热发，不过因饮食之味，入于胃中，遂觉津津汗出，饮食完而汗随止，然则以元参一味解之有余矣。况又用天麦二冬以清肺火，生地以凉血，酸枣仁以平心火，五味子以收汗而滋液，则胃经有火之盛，亦已消磨，况原未十分之盛乎？此敛法之一也。手中之汗，细小病也，不必入于此中，以药水洗之愈。　　洗手汗出，方用黄芪、葛根各一两，荆芥、防风各三钱，水煎汤一盆，热熏而温洗三次即无汗，神方也。即是此汤亦可然不若每日一换药之为妙也。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>　　　　方</p>

<p>Excessive eating and drinking leads to sweating from the stomach. Startlement depletes the essence, resulting in sweating from the heart.

<p><strong>[Note: Sweat is the fluid derived from food and drink; when one is overfull, the stomach is distended, resulting in sweating from the stomach. Blood is the essence of the heart, and sweat is the fluid of blood; when startled, it harms the heart&#39;s energy, hence it is said to deplete essence. The kidneys govern the bones; carrying heavy loads injures the bones, thus causing sweating from the kidneys. The liver governs the tendons; fatigue injures the tendons, leading to sweating from the liver. Labor harms the entire body, thus causing sweating from the spleen.]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of lung disease, there are symptoms of wheezing, coughing, reversed qi, pain in the shoulders and back, and sweating.<br>[Note: The lungs govern qi and originate from the kidneys; thus, the qi of the mother and child channels are interconnected.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The reason why people sweat is all derived from grain, and grain is born from essence. [Note: Sweat comes from the essence of water and grain, and this essence transforms from the vital energy.] When evil Qi contends within the flesh and bones and results in sweat, it indicates that the evil is expelled and the essence prevails. [Note: Contending within the flesh and bones means that the evil Qi lies hidden between them, and in spring, it struggles against the righteous Qi, manifesting as warm disease. If sweat is produced, it means that the vital energy has triumphed and the evil is combined with it and expelled.] The reoccurrence of heat signifies evil Qi. Sweat is the vital energy. Now, if sweat appears but there is still a recurrence of heat, then the evil has prevailed. If sweat occurs and the pulse remains agitated and strong, death is imminent. If the pulse does not correspond with the sweat, this indicates an inability to overcome the disease, and death is evidently near. [Note: If sweat is produced but the evil remains, it will cause further harm to the Yin essence. In cases of heat disease where sweat has been achieved but the pulse remains agitated, it indicates the extremity of Yin pulse, leading to death.] Those with Yin deficiency will certainly have Yang surging, hence they sweat when they experience little Qi and heat. [Note: When Yin is deficient, Yang tends to overpower it, resulting in sweating.] If sweat emerges with body heat, it signifies wind; if sweat emerges with frustration and fullness that does not resolve, it signifies counterflow; this condition is called wind counterflow. [Note: Wind represents Yang evil, which opens the skin and causes fluid to leak outward; the retention of wind heat results in body heat. If the wind heat does not dissipate, it harms the kidneys, causing Qi to counterflow upwards leading to heart vexation, while overwhelming the spleen earth leads to fullness; this condition is termed wind counterflow, signifying that it reverses the Qi of the kidneys due to wind evil.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>Due to heat, sweating can lead to shortness of breath and excessive talking when agitated, while silence is marked by restlessness. The body feels like burning charcoal, with sweat pouring out. When sweat is released excessively, it can lead to a state of debilitation. If sweat appears externally, it can cause skin issues like furuncles and rash. Sweating in the wind can lead to coldness and result in itching; internal stagnation may then cause furuncles. If the spirit&#39;s sweat is not fully released, the body becomes weak and the Qi can dissipate. The acupuncture points may be blocked, leading to wind-heat conditions. </p>
<p>When sweat causes one side of the body to feel damp, it indicates that the Yang Qi is weak and cannot circulate freely, resulting in localized debilitation. Visible sweating indicates damp heat is accumulating in the skin, leading to furuncles and rashes. Laboring excessively while sweating in the wind can trap cold dampness in the skin, causing itching. If the spirit&#39;s sweat is not fully released and the external pathogens are not eliminated, the accompanying Yang pathogens remain trapped within. As cold pathogens transform into heat alongside the Yang, this leads to a weak Qi state, and the external Qi cannot penetrate the meridians, resulting in blocked acupuncture points, manifesting as a wind-heat condition without cold symptoms.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes: The term &quot;尺肤濇者&quot; refers to wind bi (a type of illness). When the evil influences invade the channels, the pulse becomes slippery. The pathogenic wind obstructs between the skin and the surface, hence causing excessive sweating.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Discussion of Water Heat Points</strong></p>
<p>When one is brave and exerts too much effort, kidney sweat may emerge. If kidney sweat encounters wind, it cannot enter the organs internally or be released through the skin externally; it stays within the source area and circulates beneath the skin, leading to swelling. This condition arises from the kidneys and is termed &quot;wind water.&quot; The &quot;source area&quot; refers to the space of sweat.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: Excessive bravery and labor injure the bones, moving the kidney energy, causing fluids to rise and manifest as sweat. This leads to fluid swelling beneath the skin due to wind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Essential Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In the pulse of the Taiyang (Sun) channel, at its end, the eyes droop and the skin retracts; the color is white. If sweat ceases, death will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: The Qi of the Taiyang channel has been exhausted, hence the drooping and retraction of the eyes. The hand Taiyang governs fluids, while the foot Taiyang stores them. The cessation of sweat means loss of body fluids externally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Pain Discussion</strong></p>
<p>When heat opens the pores, the nutritive and defensive Qi circulate freely, and perspiration flows excessively, thus the Qi is depleted. When one exerts themselves, they pant and sweat, leading to leakage both internally and externally, thus depleting Qi.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: Qi serves as the solidifying force of Yin, while Yin protects Yang. In heat, when the pores open and sweating is excessive, Yang Qi leaks out. When laboring excessively harms the kidney energy, it causes internal panting while Yang Qi disperses and sweats outwards, leading to leakage both internally and externally, hence depleting Qi.</strong><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs govern the body&#39;s qi and connect with the hundred channels. When the pores open, sweat below the head cannot be stopped; this area is between the neck, chest, and back, beyond the lungs.</p>
<p>The Sun Taiyin channel of the hand governs diseases of the lungs. When qi is excessive, there is pain in the shoulders and back, and sweating from wind-cold leads to windstroke. The lung shu point is located on the back; because lung qi is abundant, it causes pain. Sweating from wind-cold leading to windstroke relates to the three yin and three yang energies on the surface that correspond to the six energies of heaven.</p>
<p>The Foot Yangming channel governs blood-related diseases, such as mania, intermittent fever, and profuse sweating. This is because the stomach controls nourishment and blood; hence it governs blood-related diseases, causing madness and hot intermittent fevers with sweating, which occurs when stomach qi is hot and vaporizes bodily fluids into sweat.</p>
<p>The Hand Shaoyang channel governs diseases related to qi, resulting in sweating. The Shaoyang represents the initial emergence of yang energy, and sweating occurs when yang manifests above yin.</p>
<p>The Foot Shaoyang channel governs diseases related to the bones, which also causes sweating. When the six yang energies are exhausted, yin and yang separate. When they separate, the pores leak, leading to the outflow of sweat. Therefore, divination indicating death in the morning results in death at night, while divination indicating death at night results in death in the morning. This reflects the inability to complete the cycle of the day. </p>
<p>Yang energy is rooted in yin and emerges from yang. Thus, when the six yang energies are on the verge of exhaustion, yin and yang are separated, leading to the escape of yang energy and the outflow of sweat, culminating in the end of yang energy.

In cases of febrile illness, the pulse is still agitated, the disease stemming from external heat affecting the channels. Those who do not sweat cannot resolve the heat from the outside; this is the extreme of external heat, and thus they die. A vigorous and agitated pulse that achieves sweating resulting in a calm pulse signifies the expulsion of external evils through sweat, and so they survive.</p>
<p>In cases of febrile illness where sweat does not emerge, with pronounced redness in the cheeks and hiccups, they die. If there is no sweat and vomiting blood occurs, they die. If there is coughing and nasal bleeding, with no sweat and insufficient blood flow to the feet, they die.</p>
<p>[Note: The absence of sweat indicates external excessive heat that cannot be resolved through sweating. Pronounced redness in the cheeks signifies extreme internal heat of the five organs. Hiccups reflect the conflict between internal and external heat, leading to exhaustion of stomach qi. The absence of sweat with blood vomiting indicates that external heat remains unresolved and has entered the yin. Coughing and nasal bleeding without sweat indicates internal heat reversing in the lungs, with nasal bleeding being surface heat driven by external pressure on the channels. The lungs govern the skin and hair; internal and external heat are all resolved through lung qi via sweating. The absence of sweat means qi is exhausted at the upper level. Insufficient blood flow to the feet means qi is exhausted at the lower level.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Five Runes on Body Fluids</strong></p>
<p>In hot weather, if the clothing is thick, the pores will open, hence sweating occurs.<br><em>Note: The pores refer to the patterns of flesh, where bodily fluids follow the pathways of the three burners and seep between the skin and muscles; thus, when the pores open, sweat greatly flows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Five Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What signs indicate that a person prone to wind-cold and sweating has a weak body? Shao Yu replied: If the flesh is not firm and the pores are loose, then one is susceptible to wind. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we tell if the flesh is not firm? Shao Yu replied: If the hamstring is weak and without structure. The &quot;structure&quot; refers to coarse texture. If the texture is coarse and the skin is not tight, then the pores are loose; this refers to the whole body’s condition.<br><em>Note: Bodily fluids accumulate between the skin and the pores; if the skin is collapsed and the structure is loose, then the fluids leak and become sweat. The energy of the sun governs the skin; thus, if the hamstring is not firm and the texture is coarse, the skin is not tightly structured, then the pores are loose and profuse sweating occurs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Five Prohibitions</strong></p>
<p>After profuse sweating, it should not be forcibly expelled.<br><em>Note: When the flesh, blood, and energy are already depleted, even if there is an excess of pathogens, they should not be expelled.</em></p>
<p><strong>Resolving Energy</strong></p>
<p>When the pores open and sweat flows profusely, this is called the body&#39;s fluids. When fluids are lost, the pores are open, and sweat flows heavily.<br><em>Note: The fluids emerge from the pores, thus when the fluids are lost, the pores open, and sweat flows heavily.</em><a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Principles of the Defensive and Nutritive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: When a person feels heat and their food has just entered the stomach, if the qi is not stable, sweating will immediately occur—sometimes from the face, sometimes from the back, or sometimes from the midsection. This sweating does not follow the pathway of the defensive qi; what is the reason? Qi Bo answered: This is due to an external injury from wind, which opens the pores, causing the hair to evaporate and allow the defensive qi to escape, thus it cannot follow its proper pathway. This qi is fierce, slippery, and rapid, and when it is opened, it escapes, hence it is called leakage.</p>
<p>The defensive qi flows from the upper jiao; the pathway it follows has never reached the face or the back. Now, when food has just entered the stomach, and the essence of the nutritive and defensive qi is not yet defined, sweating may occur first on the face or on the back. This is the defensive qi not following its path. The defensive qi spreads throughout the body, without failing to nourish any part. If sweating occurs from the midsection, it is a deviation of the defensive qi. The defensive qi is the fierce qi of food and fluids, its nature being fierce, slippery, and rapid; if the pores are not tightly closed, it will escape as soon as they open, hence it cannot follow its path.</p>
<p>The nutritive and defensive qi represent the refined essence. Blood represents the vital essence. Hence, blood and qi are different names for the same category. Thus, if blood is lost, there is no sweat; if sweat is lost, there is no blood. The nutritive and defensive qi arise from the essence of food and liquid. Blood is transformed from the vital essence. Both blood and the nutritive and defensive qi arise from essence, thus they are different names but belong to the same category. Sweat is merely the liquid of blood, transformed from qi into sweat; therefore, if blood is lost, there is no sweat, and if sweat is lost, there is no blood.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

The body swells, there is fever, sweating and thirst, resembling wind-water, sweat stains the clothes, the color is exactly yellow like the juice of the licorice plant, and the pulse is sinking. How does one contract this illness? </p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> It is contracted by sweating and then entering water for a bath; the water enters through the sweat pores. The formula for treatment is a decoction of astragalus, peony, cinnamon, and wine.</p>
<p>The illness of yellow sweat manifests with cold in the lower legs. Even if there is fever, this is related to the seasonal changes. If sweating occurs after eating, followed by night sweats, this indicates a deficiency in nourishment and energy. If sweating occurs and then fever returns, and this continues for a long time, the body will have misalignments, and persistent fever will surely lead to the development of sores. If the body feels heavy but the sweat lightens, over time it will lead to trembling; the trembling will cause chest pain, and sweat will flow from above the waist while below there is none. The waist and hips will feel painful and relaxed as if there is something under the skin; in severe cases, one cannot eat, experiences body aches and heaviness, restlessness, and difficulty urinating. This is called yellow sweat, treated with a decoction of cinnamon and astragalus.</p>
<p><strong>Death Signs from Sweating</strong></p>
<p>In cases of heat illness with sweating but a still pulse, if the pulse fluctuates greatly, death will occur. If there is reversal of qi with sweating and a weak and slow pulse, death will occur. If sweat does not flow, death will happen.</p>
<p>If liver-related sweating occurs like water, with fear and restlessness, lying down with a straight gaze and a pale face, death will occur in eight days; it is also referred to as immediate death.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Discussion on Cold Damage</h3>
<p>In cold damage, if there is no sweat, there are seven signs; if there is free sweating, there are nine signs. Conditions like solar cold damage, recent heat illness, taiyin disease, shaoyin disease, jueyin disease, yin-yang changing disease, and winter yangming disease all have no sweat. When sweating occurs, the nine signs include disharmony of defenses, common cold, warm winds, dampness, heat strokes, yangming disease, loss of yang, soft convulsions, and cholera; all involve free sweating. However, shaoyin must not have sweat, yet there are signs of spontaneous sweat; yangming disease often presents with much sweat, but also has cases of absence of sweat, which should not be overlooked.<br>Question: &quot;Sweat on the head.&quot; Answer: &quot;The patient is externally solid but internally empty, with the original qi obstructed, causing yang qi to rise and sweat to appear on the head. Whenever there is sweat on the head, it indicates that the five internal organs are dried out, the membranes are empty, and fluids are minimal; careful attention must be paid to avoid purging. If one purges, it is termed severe emptiness. Yet, there are several signs associated with sweating on the head.&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of cold damage lasting five to six days, if there is sweating on the forehead, slight aversion to cold, cold hands and feet, fullness below the heart, no desire to eat, constipation, and a thin pulse, this indicates a mild yang blockage, meaning there must be symptoms on both the exterior and interior. A submerged pulse also indicates an interior issue. Sweating signifies mild yang; if pure yin were to be blocked, there would be no external symptoms, and everything would descend into the interior, indicating a situation half in the interior and half in the exterior. Although the pulse may be submerged and tight, it cannot be regarded as a condition of lesser yin. The reason for this is that yin cannot produce sweat; since there is sweating on the forehead, it is known not to be lesser yin.</p>
<p>For cold damage lasting five to six days, after sweating has occurred, if there is fullness in the chest and hypochondria, slight blockage, difficult urination, thirst without vomiting, but only sweating on the forehead, this means the exterior is not yet resolved.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one experiences sweating and blood in the case of Yangming disease, it results from heat entering the blood chamber. If only head sweat occurs, one should needle the Qimen point and based on the situation, let it drain; once sweating occurs, recovery follows.</p>
<p>Concerning spontaneous sweating in febrile diseases, how is it understood? Spontaneous sweating refers to sweating that occurs naturally, without being induced by external dispersal. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that Yang Qi protects the exterior, providing firmness. The protective Qi guards the skin, ensuring the pores are full and preventing fluids from leaking. When sweating occurs, it expels evil qi. If the protective Qi is inadequate and cannot maintain firmness, the skin loosens and the pores become too open, leading to the unwanted leakage of fluids, which results in spontaneous sweating. If a person has a fever and sweats without recovery, it indicates disharmony in the protective Qi, with Wind evil interfering with it. If one has heat stroke with sweating, a sensation of chill, body heat, and thirst, it indicates Summer evil interfering with the protective Qi. When there’s excessive sweating and dampness, it is due to excessive Wind-Damp evil interfering with the protective Qi. Thus, it is understood that protective Qi secures fluids, preventing their unwarranted leakage; it is always due to the interference of evil Qi that sweating begins. The poisons of Wind, Cold, Summer, and Dampness are the atmospheric evils of the four seasons, which cause febrile diseases in individuals. Both Wind and Summer-Dampness are evils that induce spontaneous sweating. However, Cold alone harms the body without causing sweating. Cold injures the nutrients but does not harm the protective Qi; when there is no interference from evil Qi, the skin remains tight, and the fluids stay intact, which is why sweating does not occur.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As the qi gradually enters the interior and transforms into heat, it also leads to spontaneous sweating. This occurs because when there is heat, the protective and nutritive qi communicate, the pores open, and sweat is released. However, signs of spontaneous sweating also have distinctions between exterior and interior, and differences between deficiency and excess. If there is sweating accompanied by aversion to wind or slight aversion to cold, this indicates that the exterior has not yet resolved and one must wait for dispersal before recovery. In cases where the sweating does not stop and there is aversion to wind, or if there is aversion to cold after sweating, this indicates a deficiency in the exterior; one must wait for warming of the channels to recover. All these are instances where pathogenic qi is present on the exterior. If the sweating occurs without aversion to cold, this indicates that the exterior has resolved but the interior is still unharmonized. The classics say: When the Yangming causes fever and sweat, it is called heat surpassing. They also say: If the Yangming disease has fever and abundant sweating, it must be urgently purged. This is not the same as sweating that occurs due to pathogenic qi on the exterior, which can be mitigated. Spontaneous sweating in cases of cold damage is common. If sweating occurs and feels oily or is as large as beads, or if sweat emerges without flowing, these are signs of a condition that cannot be treated. It is essential for both hands and feet to be warm and the entire body to be moist, gently perspiring for a time until the heat dissipates and the body cools and harmonizes; this is the ideal condition. This reflects the harmony of yin and yang, the rise of water and the descent of fire, the flow of nutritive and protective qi, and the exit and resolution of pathogenic qi. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The sweat of Yang is named after the rain of heaven and earth; this is it.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Night Sweats</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold-induced night sweats, how can we clarify this? Night sweats refer to sweating during sleep. Spontaneous sweating may occur whether one is asleep or awake, arising naturally. Night sweats, however, cannot occur without sleep; they manifest only when asleep, and stop upon waking. In instances of mixed diseases causing night sweats, one attributes it to Yang deficiency. The night sweats due to cold injury are not the same deficiency as in mixed diseases; rather, they result from pathogenic influences being present both internally and externally. How so? If the pathogenic influence were purely external, it would naturally cause sweating by affecting the defensive (Wei) Qi. In this case, the pathogenic influence can penetrate the interior while still connected to the exterior. During sleep, the defensive Qi operates inwardly, while the Yang Qi at the surface is insufficient, leading to the loss of fluid, hence sweating during sleep; upon waking, the Qi disperses outward and the sweating ceases. The classics say: &quot;If slight night sweats occur accompanied by chills and aversion to cold, the exterior has not yet resolved.&quot; Additionally, in Yangming disease, if there is a need for the interior to be full while the pulse is floating, it indicates night sweats, which suggests the presence of external pathogens. Moreover, in cases of simultaneous Yang syndromes, one may notice spontaneous sweating. This illustrates that night sweats arise from a pathogenic influence situated between the surface and the interior. Furthermore, spontaneous sweating can arise from both deficiency (vacuity) and excess (repletion). In the case of night sweats, it is not the same as spontaneous sweating due to repletion; attention must be paid solely to harmonizing the exterior, which should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Sweating</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage leading to head sweating, how is this understood? The head is where all the Yang channels converge. When pathogenic factors invade the Yang, and the fluids gather upwards, sweating occurs on the head. If internal heat accumulates and evaporates through the pores, causing sweating all over the body, this is referred to as excess heat. If there is no sweating from the body, then the heat does not escape. When heat steams in the Yang, only sweating from the head occurs. Why is this? Because the channels of the three Yin run up to the neck and chest and then return, without following to the head; only the Yang channels ascend to the head.</p>
<p>The scripture states: if sweating occurs only on the head, and not on the body, and it returns to the neck, with difficulty in urination and thirst for water, this indicates that stagnant heat resides within, and the body must turn yellow, as the heat cannot ascend upwards. Additionally, if heat enters the blood chamber, causing vexation, or if the Yangming is consumed by fire, or if water accumulates in the chest, all result in sweating from the head; these too are due to internal heat stagnation and inability to escape.</p>
<p>In these instances, whether by vomiting or purging, the aim is to eliminate the heat. Some might say that the symptoms of head sweating belong entirely to Yangming and represent internal heat, but could there be cases not associated with Yangming but rather with the exterior? It is also the case that when the pathogens are only on the surface, there are no symptoms of head sweating. Only when cold and damp clash, with the pathogenic qì half on the surface and half inside, does head sweating occur.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>Likewise, after five or six days of febrile illness, if there is sweating on the forehead, a mild aversion to cold, cold hands and feet, fullness beneath the heart, loss of appetite, constipation, and a thin pulse, this indicates that the pathogenic influence is half in the superficial and half in the deep, resulting in sweat on the forehead. </p>
<p>For those with dampness, only sweating on the forehead, desiring to be covered and facing the fire indicates a struggle between cold and dampness, leading to sweating on the forehead as well. </p>
<p>All these conditions are provoked by pathogenic influences causing natural sweating on the forehead, and should not be interpreted as a reversal. If urination is not smooth, it is adverse to find sweating on the forehead; for those with dampness, after purging, it is also adverse to see sweating on the forehead. These two conditions are what constitute the reversal of sweating on the forehead. Why is this? Because difficulty in urination creates a blockage; when sweating on the forehead occurs, it indicates yang collapse. </p>
<p>The classic states: When blockage prevents urination, if there is no sweat on the head, there is survival, but if there is sweating, there is death. For those with dampness, if sweating appears on the forehead and there is slight gasping, it also indicates yang collapse. </p>
<p>The classic states: For those with dampness and purging, if sweating appears on the forehead and urination is difficult, they die; if there is continuous diarrhea, they also die. The &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; says: When yang energy rises and sweat appears on the head, it signifies yang collapse. Knowing what can be treated and treating it, as well as knowing what cannot be treated and not treating it, all those who attain completeness depend on clear discernment and careful judgment.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of febrile disease where the hands and feet sweat, what can be deduced? The limbs are the foundation of all Yang, and the stomach governs the limbs. Sweating in the hands and feet is a manifestation of Yangming. When the Yang channels are affected by heat, it leads to sweating in the hands and feet. Yangming is also the master of bodily fluids; hence, spontaneous sweating occurs. Those who experience sweating all over the body, only on the head, or specifically in the hands and feet all belong to the category of Yangming. Why does this happen? If there is sweating all over the body, it is said to be &quot;heat excess,&quot; indicating heat reaching the surface. If sweating occurs only on the head, it means the heat cannot escape, and the heat rises upwards. When sweating is confined to the hands and feet, it indicates that heat is concentrated in the stomach, affecting the fluids. The record states: when hands and feet sweat profusely, the stool must be difficult; when they sweat a little, and the stool is hard with aphasia, purging will lead to recovery. From this, it is clear that sweating in the hands and feet indicates heat accumulation in the stomach. </p>
<p>Some may ask: if heat gathers in the stomach causing sweating in the hands and feet, is it possible for cold accumulation in the stomach to also cause sweating? The record states: when cold is in the Yangming, one cannot eat, urination is difficult, and there is profuse sweating in the hands and feet, this points to the desire to develop a mass, showing that it is indeed cold accumulation. Moreover, heat accumulation in the stomach signifies a condition that can be purged, while cold accumulation indicates one that cannot. How can this be clarified? To differentiate both conditions, it must be noted that if the stool initially is hard and later becomes soft, it signifies that the stomach is cold, leading to a lack of separation between food and drink, which is why purging is not appropriate. If the stool is hard and there are symptoms of Yangming, it is indeed an indication for purging. Thus, in the time of encountering a disease, careful consideration is essential.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>No Sweat</strong></p>
<p>How can we explain the absence of sweat in cases of cold damage? The pores (腠理) are where fluids exude and converge, while the meridians (理) are the junctions where patterns meet. Fluids can be affected by wind, heat, and dampness; when they accumulate at the skin&#39;s surface, sweat is produced. However, if a cold pathogen penetrates the channels and compresses the pores, there will be no sweat as fluids cannot seep out. </p>
<p>The lack of sweat can arise from several conditions: if the cold damage remains superficial or the pathogen moves inward, or if water-damp accumulates internally, or from a prolonged deficiency of yang. All these can lead to an absence of sweat, indicating that the pores are tightly closed. When wind is caught in the defensive (卫), the pores open and sweating occurs. Conversely, when cold penetrates to the nutritive (荣), sweating does not occur, signifying the closure of the pores.</p>
<p>The classics discuss conditions such as &quot;sun disease with aversion to wind, no sweat, and wheezing,&quot; along with signs of a floating, tight pulse without sweat and fever, restlessness without sweating, as well as yangming disease presenting with no sweat but frequent urination, vomiting, and coughing over two to three days, along with cold extremities and headache, a dry nose, and an inability to sweat. All these patterns indicate the presence of a cold pathogen at the surface leading to a lack of sweating. Conversely, when the pathogen acts internally without sweat, it signifies that the external pathogen has not been expelled properly, resulting in no sweating.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classic text states that in cases where Yangming disease presents without sweating, with difficult urination and a feeling of discomfort in the heart, the body will inevitably turn yellow; similarly, in cases of cold damage with fever and no sweating, thirst with a desire to drink water, and without exterior symptoms, the prescription of Baihu Decoction with Ginseng is indicated. In cases of the three Yin conditions where sweating does not occur, these symptoms indicate that evil is acting internally without producing sweat. The accumulation of fluids within the body, without sweating, leads to the formation of phlegm and bodily fluids; when fluids are retained internally and fail to flow, there will be insufficient bodily fluids to produce sweat. </p>
<p>Regarding the prescription of Gui Zhi Decoction or purgatives, if there is still persistent headache, heat sensation, and no sweating, along with fullness and slight pain beneath the heart, and difficult urination, one should modify the formula by removing cinnamon and adding Fuling and Baizhu. This is again due to the infiltration of bodily fluids without producing sweat. If there is Yang deficiency without sweating, Yang is the master of bodily fluids; when Yang is deficient, the bodily fluids become insufficient, resulting in no sweating. </p>
<p>The text further explains that a floating and slow pulse indicates absence of Yang, which cannot produce sweat, leading to itching of the body. In Yangming disease, when there is no sweating, the skin may feel as if insects are crawling beneath it, which is a sign of prolonged deficiency; thus, it is all due to Yang deficiency and lack of sweating. This reasoning aligns with the principles of medicine; how could it be considered different? If a person should sweat but does not, and after taking one dose of herbal decoction the symptoms persist, then if after three doses there is still no sweating, this is considered a critical illness. Additionally, in cases of heat illness with a rapid pulse where sweating is absent, Huangdi declares this to be at the extreme of Yang pulse, indicating death. These two cases regard the absence of sweating as the true illness; how could they be equated with other instances of no sweating in a casual manner?<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Dominance of Dampness Over Yang</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: Is dampness associated with yin or yang? I said: It is related to the southwest, the earth. Sweat in humans is akin to rain in heaven and earth; when yin nourishes its dampness, it manifests as mist and dew. Yin dampness is cold and descends, representing the earth&#39;s qi. When there is excessive sweat, it leads to a loss of yang; when yang departs, yin prevails, resulting in great coldness. When dampness dominates, one&#39;s voice sounds as if emerging from a jar; dampness feels like being submerged in water. It is said among practitioners that the sound of earth resembles that from deep inside a jar, signifying obstruction and inability to emerge, clearly indicating dampness. Moreover, it is understood that these two—dampness and cold—are yin. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: when qi is deficient, external cold affects us. Even if one appears to sweat from internal heat, in the end, it transmits to great cold. One must recognize that it initially begins as internal heat, but when the exterior is deficient and yang is lost, it cannot withstand external cold, eventually leading to coldness inside and often resulting in rheumatic cold. Colors reflect the heavens, pulses reflect the earth; the form of a person corresponds to the yin and yang of the earth. Therefore, through pulse and qi, we evaluate both the visible and invisible aspects.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>No Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When genuine Qi is depleted and stomach fire is excessive, sweating does not stop, indicating that the genuine Qi in the stomach has already been exhausted. If Yin fire has declined, lack of sweating leads to restlessness, showing that both Yin and Yang are weak. Lack of sweating in all seasons does not last long; dampness declines while dryness increases, which is a regular principle. The short-lived form indicates that autumn qi is associated with death, leading to the depletion of vitality. Vitality refers to the stomach&#39;s vital energy, which is the transformative energy generated in spring&#39;s lesser Yang.</p>

Fire steaming the dampness in the stomach can also lead to sweating; Cool the Diaphragm Powder is indicated. Phlegm conditions can also cause sweating.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Night Sweats</strong></p>
<p>Night sweats are associated with deficiency of blood and yin, and do not require treatment in children. Avoid using fresh ginger. There is a prescription by Dongyuan that uses a formula with six yellow herbs and angelica, which is very effective, but the medicinal properties are cold. For those who are weak, only use a formula of astragalus and six parts. If night sweats are accompanied by heat due to yin deficiency, add the four substances plus coptis; if combined with qi deficiency, include ginseng, astragalus, and white atractylodes. Night sweats refer to sweating during sleep; if not sleeping, sweating does not occur. When in deep sleep, sweat may emerge, but it stops upon waking, unlike spontaneous sweating which occurs without sleep. In cases of night sweats caused by mixed illnesses, they are attributed to yang deficiency. Those with night sweats from cold-induced illness are also related to heart deficiency. It is advisable to gather heart energy and nourish kidney water, so that yin and yang are harmonized, allowing the regulation of water and fire, causing the sweating to cease.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Sweat</strong></p>
<p>When there is no sweat elsewhere, but sweat is present in the heart region, excessive thinking leads to more sweating. The issue lies in heart use, so it is advisable to nourish heart blood. Use moxa-steamed decoction, adjusting with one penny of poria powder. This is called heart sweat. Additionally, second leaves of blue mulberry dried and powdered, mixed with empty rice drink, are the best for stopping night sweats.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: the fluid of the heart is sweat. &quot;The Original Patterns of Disease&quot; states: heat in the heart causes sweating. Dong Yuan says: the southwest corresponds to the earth, which in humans relates to the spleen and stomach. The sweat of a person is like the rain of heaven and earth; when the yin nourishes its moisture, it becomes mist, dew, and rain. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the heart alone governs, yet Dong Yuan also refers to the spleen and stomach—why is that? It is because the heart, being the sovereign fire, governs heat, while the spleen and stomach, governed by earth, control moisture. The combination of moisture and heat leads to sweat. Similarly, the earth’s humidity rises as clouds and mist; if the heavens do not provide rain, it cannot accumulate into a downpour. It is also like liquor being heated in a steamer; without boiling and steaming, it cannot become liquid sweat. Each organ can cause sweating, but the heart and the spleen-stomach specifically govern moisture and heat, thus they are the main controllers. Therefore, the classics also state: when one has eaten excessively, sweat emerges from the stomach. In shock, one loses essence, and sweat emerges from the heart. Carrying heavy loads over long distances, sweat emerges from the kidneys. Running in fear, sweat emerges from the liver. Exhaustion from labor causes sweat to emerge from the spleen. As for spontaneous perspiration and night sweats, they resemble each other but are fundamentally different. Spontaneous perspiration occurs incessantly, worsened by movement, and belongs to yang deficiency; it is governed by the protective qi. Night sweats, on the other hand, occur while sleeping, making the body feel drenched, stopping only upon awakening; it relates to yin deficiency and is governed by the nutritious blood. Generally, spontaneous perspiration should be treated by tonifying yang and regulating the protective qi, whereas night sweats should be addressed by nourishing yin and lowering fire. Therefore, in cases of heart deficiency with cold sweat emerging, it is suitable to nourish the liver, enhance the origin of fire, and dispel the yin shadows; in cases of yin deficiency with fiery symptoms, the method should be to nourish the kidneys, strengthen the water element, and control the yang fire.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Sweat Disorders</strong>  </p>
<p>Nocturnal sweating, which occurs during deep sleep, is called &quot;night sweats,&quot; also known as &quot;sleeping sweats.&quot; Sweating that occurs regardless of whether one is sitting or lying down is termed &quot;spontaneous sweating.&quot; Sweating from wind, heat, cold, dampness, or cough corresponds to spontaneous sweating, which is documented in the relevant sections. For those who sweat profusely without any illness or those who sweat excessively after an illness, both scenarios pertain to deficiency of the exterior, instability of stomach qi, and leakage of mother blood. It is advisable to use Huang Qi Jian Zhong Tang with a small addition of floating wheat or to apply Yu Ping Feng San. </p>
<p>For essential sweating accompanied by a normal body temperature yet producing cold sweat, or cold body sweat that remains cold without any other illness, this also falls under the same category. If there is phlegm-associated cold sweating, then Qi Qi Tang should be administered. When there is Qi blockage leading to persistent spontaneous sweating, treatment to adjust Qi and harmonize the defensive and nutritive systems is necessary, typically using Xiao Jian Zhong Tang with the addition of Mu Xiang. </p>
<p>In cases of post-illness excessive sweating, if taking major tonics like Zheng Yuan Yin does not yield improvement, Ba Zhen San should be used.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those who sweat excessively throughout the year, it is advisable to use black tin pills. Those who have recovered from a serious illness and are still sweating may also take them. This condition should not be treated with heat supplements; it requires balancing the yin and yang for self-healing, and should primarily focus on spiritual sand pills. This is not meant to address other ailments but is specifically for stopping sweating; it does not indicate that there are coexisting diseases.</p>
<p>If one takes various medicines without halting the sweating, but instead finds that the medicine makes one hotter and the sweating worsens, it simply affects the heart&#39;s blood. Sweat is a fluid of the heart; when the heart lacks nourishment, it cannot hold blood, leading to overflow as sweat. Therefore, one should use a decoction of rhubarb and astragalus with half a qian of roasted sour jujube seeds. If there is mild heat, add half a qian of roasted dendrobium, and also take the spiritual sand pills.</p>
<p>Sweat that is sticky like glue, or as condensed as pearls, or drips down heavily like rain, and cannot be wiped away, is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>For those who sweat excessively and have an underlying deficiency heat, one should not resort to heat but should use astringent medicines. If sweating occurs with pathogenic heat and the person is not thirsty, the best remedy is a modified Xiao Chai Hu decoction with half a qian of cinnamon twig.</p>
<p>To treat heart deficiency with excessive sweating and insomnia, take one wild boar&#39;s heart, cut it open while still bleeding, and add two taels of ginseng and two taels of angelica.

<p>Head sweat emerges from the neck and returns; it is a blood condition. Why is there more on the forehead? It is said: The head is where the six Yangs converge, thus heat steams and causes sweat to emerge. More sweat on the forehead is because the left cheek pertains to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the nose to the middle burner, the mandible to the kidneys, and the forehead to the heart. The fire of the triple burner exhausts the kidney water, and what remains is forced upward into the heart region; therefore, it manifests as head sweat, and the excess on the forehead belongs to the heart category as a blood condition. If head sweat appears after drinking wine or consuming food, it is also a blood condition. As for mixed conditions, when the fire of the heart pushes the kidney water upward into the heart, it causes night sweats or spontaneous sweating, which may lead to head sweat or a sensation of fullness in the heart area; all these are treated similarly as blood conditions. Regardless of whether there are cold damage or mixed diseases from wine accumulation, if there is a sense of fullness under the heart, it indicates a blood condition. Why is that? It is said: If one purges and loses Yin, losing Yin means damaging the spleen and stomach and losing blood, with Qi trapped in the chest, leading to diminished blood and consequent fullness in the heart area. Thus, it feels full under the heart. People believe that blood diseases should utilize Qi medicine to guide it, but this exacerbates the fullness issue, and if purged again, it transforms into a sensation of bloating—not the proper treatment. How should one then treat this? One should solely nourish the middle burner with spleen tonics and use blood medicine to treat it; there is no better method than this.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweating</strong></p>
<p>Sweat is the true essence of the original yang. Those who sweat excessively due to food, fear, labor, or movement are termed as having excessive sweating. Sweating persistently without regard to day or night is called spontaneous sweating. This indicates a deficiency of yang energy in defense. For excessive sweating due to heat, one should use the &quot;Supplementing the Middle and Enhancing Qi Decoction&quot; with added Ephedra root and Floating Wheat. Elevating agents such as Rhubarb and Cinnamon should be stir-fried with honey to mitigate their uplifting nature, and they should guide Ginseng and Astragalus to the skin&#39;s surface, hence they are essential. For sweating with cold limbs, use the &quot;Ancient Astragalus and Attachia Decoction&quot; or &quot;Shun Yuan Powder.&quot; If both qi and blood are deficient, employ the &quot;Astragalus Building the Middle Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>For spontaneous sweating accompanied by phlegm syndrome, dizziness, and vomiting, it is appropriate to take a decoction of Chuanxiong, Atractylodes, Chenpi (dried tangerine peel), and licorice. If there is excessive sweating with a soft body, this indicates dampness. The heart governs heat, and the spleen governs dampness; when damp-heat clashes, it is like the moisture of the earth that condenses into clouds, mist, or rain. All organs can produce sweat, but mainly the heart and spleen-stomach are the principals of damp-heat. The &quot;Regulating Defense Decoction&quot; or &quot;Yupingfeng Powder&quot; should be employed. </p>
<p>When fire blazes upwards, and dampness causes sweating in the stomach, use &quot;Cooling the Diaphragm Powder.&quot; For stomach heat, employ the &quot;Two Sweet Decoction.&quot; It is clear that spontaneous sweating can indeed be of a solid nature. Therefore, the initial symptoms of external pathogenic influence often include spontaneous sweating. For wind syndrome, use &quot;Cinnamon Twig Decoction&quot; with added Aconite; for cold syndrome, &quot;Ancient Cinnamon and Aconite Decoction&quot;; for暑症 (heat syndrome), &quot;Five Reeds Powder&quot;; for wind-damp coinciding, use &quot;Fangji and Astragalus Decoction.&quot; In cases of prolonged spontaneous sweating where Ginseng, Astragalus, and Aconite do not work, one should nourish heart blood. If sweating is dry but still accompanied by heat, it must be due to an external wind pathogen, and one should use &quot;Ginseng and Perilla Decoction,&quot; stopping once the illness is resolved; this is a method of counteracting treatment.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zhongzi’s Essential Readings on Medicine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Various Sweating Disorders</strong></p>
<p>I humbly note that what the heart contains within is blood, and what is outside is sweat. Sweat is the fluid of the heart, and since the kidneys regulate the five fluids, there has never been a case of sweating disorder that does not arise from deficiency of heart blood. When heart yang is deficient, it cannot guard the exterior, leading to spontaneous sweating from exterior injuries; when kidney yin declines, it cannot nourish and retreat inwardly, resulting in nocturnal sweating from internal injuries. However, the sweating from these two conditions differs in terms of temperature. If cold qi invades due to yang deficiency, the sweat produced will certainly be cold; if hot qi invades due to yin deficiency, the sweat will certainly be hot. Nonetheless, excessive heat can injure and transform into cold, which should also not be neglected. </p>
<p>As for those with lung deficiency, to secure the skin and hair, one may use Huangqi Liuyi Decoction or Yupingfeng Powder. For spleen deficiency, to strengthen the interior qi, one might take Buzhong Yiqi Decoction or Sijunzi Decoction. For heart deficiency, to nourish the blood vessels, Donggui Liuhuang Decoction is indicated. In cases of spleen deficiency, one should restrict the dispersing effects, using Baishao, Zaoren, and Wumei. For kidney deficiency, to aid in sealing and storage, one can use Wuweizi, Shanzhuyu, Longgu, Digupi, Muli, Yuanzi, Wubeizi, and Heshouwu. </p>
<p>Furthermore, inside the five organs, there are nuances of warmth and clarity, moisture and dryness. It is inappropriate to apply rigid methods to an ever-changing array of conditions.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment of Various Sweating Symptoms from Cold Damage</h3>
<p>For spontaneous sweating accompanied by aversion to wind and cold, use Guizhi Decoction. If there is aversion to cold with spontaneous sweating, it indicates deficiency of the exterior; Xiao Jian Zhong Decoction or Huangqi Jian Zhong Decoction may be used. If spontaneous sweating occurs without aversion to wind and cold, it indicates exhaustion of the exterior and is accompanied by interior excess; use Chengqi Decoction. If sweating is profuse and accompanied by frequent urination, this indicates depletion of body fluids; although the stool may be dry and cannot be purged, it is advisable to use honey decoction. The method involves simmering honey in a copper container over low heat until slightly thickened, stirring it to avoid burning, then adding a small amount of ground soapwort and shaping it into jujube-sized balls. After cooling, administer through the mouth to facilitate bowel movement. For spontaneous sweating with thirst and difficulty in urination, use Wuling Powder. If sweating persists excessively, it is called loss of yang; use Guizhi Fuzhu Decoction and externally apply a combination of Bai Zhu, Jiao Ben, Chuan Xiong, and Bai Zhi (each one tael), along with crushed oyster shell and rice flour (each two taels, finely powdered) in a gauze bag, applying it all over the body. </p>
<p>If sweating occurs at the interface of the interior and exterior, it indicates heat in the gallbladder; use Xiaochaihu Decoction. If sweating arises from the head, indicating that heat cannot be expelled and yang qi is rising, leading to delirium, use Chengqi Decoction. If there is fullness beneath the heart and sweating from the head, it indicates water accumulation in the chest; use Xiao Banxia Fuling Decoction. If sweating from the head causes difficulty in urination, it can be fatal. For sweating in the hands and feet with dry stool and delirium, use Dazhengqi Decoction. If cold prevents eating and urination is unbeneficial, causing undifferentiated water and food, along with sweating in the hands and feet, use Lizhong Decoction.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Sweating</strong></p>
<p>What is stored in the heart, when internal, is blood; when external, it manifests as sweat. Sweat is the essence of the heart, and the condition of spontaneous sweating arises from both the heart and kidneys being deficient. Therefore, when yin and yang are deficient, the pores will open and cause heat, leading to spontaneous sweating. This is fundamentally due to the imbalance of yin and yang. Additionally, conditions such as wind injury, heat stroke, dampness, fright, excessive sexual activity, extreme fatigue, seasonal changes, intestinal abscesses, phlegm and fluid accumulation, and postpartum conditions can also cause spontaneous sweating. Zhongjing noted that when the flesh is exhausted, bodily fluids escape, the pores open, and sweat pours out. Chao&#39;s commentary states that in cases of deficient labor, if yang energy is significantly deficient, the fluids will disperse as sweat. It is also said that heat in the heart will open the pores, and when the pores open, sweating occurs. The various explanations from different schools regarding sweating generally align with this understanding. Upon investigation, it is realized that sweat is a discharge of bodily fluids. Fluids and qi are similar in nature; where qi reaches, fluids inevitably follow. Therefore, the statement in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that the heart is linked to sweat is of great significance! The heart is the governing organ of yang, and yang represents fire and qi; thus, all the yang of the five organs and six bowels is overseen by the heart to facilitate its transformations.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block original">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>是故津者，随其阳气所在之处而生，亦随其火扰所在之处，泄出为汗，其汗尽由心出也。不然，何《内经》言风、言劳动、言阴阳相争者，其汗各由其所在脏腑而出之乎？然五脏六腑，又必以十二经络荣卫为要，因经脉是司其出入行气之隧道。荣行脉中，以滋阴血；卫行脉外，以固阳气。阳气固则腠理肥，元府密，而脏腑经脉荣卫贯通。若在内之脏腑与表之经脉离居，则两者出入之机皆废，于是邪在于内，则元府不密，而汗从脏腑出；邪在表，则腠理不固，而汗从经脉出。所以自汗之由，不可胜计。至若脏腑之阴，拒格卫气，浮散于外，无所依从，或胃气虚衰水谷气脱散者，或肺气微弱不能宣行荣卫而津脱者，如是自汗，虽病重而尚有可治，独三阳之绝汗出者，不可治矣。<a id="orig-40p" href="#trans-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, fluid production follows the location of the yang energy and also corresponds to where the fire disturbance occurs, leading to sweating, which ultimately exits through the heart. Otherwise, why would the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mention wind, labor, and the struggle between yin and yang, with sweat emerging from various organs? The five internal organs and six hollow organs must rely on the meridians for nourishment and defense, as the meridians serve as pathways for the movement of qi. The nourishment meridian nourishes yin and blood, while the defensive meridian secures yang energy. When yang energy is firm, the pores are healthy, the original cavity is secure, and the connections between the organs and meridians are seamless. If the internal organs and external meridians are disconnected, their interchanges are disrupted; thus, if illness is internal, the original cavity is not secure, and sweat emerges from the organs; if the illness is on the surface, then the pores are not firm, and sweat escapes from the meridians. Therefore, the causes of sweating are numerous. As for the yin of the organs blocking the defensive qi and dispersing outward without support, it may be due to weak stomach qi causing dispersion of food essence or weak lung qi unable to circulate nourishment and defense, resulting in spontaneous sweating. Such cases, even if severe, still hold potential for treatment, but for those whose three yang are completely exhausted, the sweating cannot be treated.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Night Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When the defensive qi moves through the night in the yin, it may encounter the six excesses of nature on the surface, or be affected by the changes in human qi due to the rise and fall of vitality, similar to the five evils and six excesses of the heavens that interact within. Additionally, the yin and yang within the organs and meridians may counteract each other, leading to a deficiency of yang qi. However, it is not only cold, dampness, and dryness that can harm yang. Wind, fire, and heat, which align with yang, can also inflict damage, particularly when the fire of the heart rises from the kidneys and liver along the four meridians, leading to even greater harm. </p>
<p>Fire cannot coexist with original qi; thus, when fire is excessive, yang is diminished. The defensive qi and yang are one; therefore, when yang is weak, the defense is also deficient. The deficiency of the defensive qi operates in yin; during sleep, there is even less qi to secure the surface, causing the pores to open and fluids to leak out as sweat. When awake, with the eyes open, the yin qi re-disperses to the surface, and the sweating ceases. This condition is called night sweating, specifically the perspiration that occurs during sleep. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that those with kidney ailments may experience abdominal swelling, limb edema, wheezing, coughing, and sweating during sleep. Additionally, excessive water elements or severe influences from the earth may lead to similar conditions.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Note: When the kidney evil attacks the lungs and heart, it internally produces subtle heart fluids as sweat, leading to nocturnal sweating. In Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases,&quot; this is termed night sweats. It is stated that in the case of yangming disease, one should expect internal fullness, and if the pulse is floating, it must be night sweating. Additionally, in the case of the three yang diseases combined, if the eyes connect, there will be sweating. Cheng Wujing commented that cold-induced night sweats are not merely due to yang deficiency as in other mixed diseases, but are caused by the evil residing between the exterior and interior. Why? If the evil Qi resides entirely on the exterior, affecting the defensive Qi, then spontaneous sweating occurs. However, if the evil Qi invades the interior and connects to the exterior, then when one sleeps, the defensive Qi moves into the interior, sustaining the interior Yang Qi, leading to the leakage of fluids and resulting in night sweats. This is not solely a result of deficiency, but must also be a result of some level of fullness, and regarding night sweats, it should still be considered an exterior condition. Observing Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s two discussions may seem different, but upon close examination of their subtleties, they can be seen as one and the same. Why is this? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses the source, stating that the heart and kidneys are the masters of Yin and Yang, thus sweating must arise from the Yang of the heart, and sleeping must arise from the Yin of the kidneys. Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s statements follow the Yin and Yang based on the location of the evil, thus resulting in night sweats; this specifically pertains to the flow of Yin and Yang.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To trace its origins, it is entirely the function of the defensive Qi. Defensive Qi is transformed from the Qi of food and nourished by the lungs. However, the true Yang of heaven must be present in order to be abundant; without it, it weakens. Therefore, the discussion on the Yang Qi in the Treatise on the Vital Energy of Life refers to it as a heavenly Qi, which, when followed, solidifies the Yang. This is aligned with the outer defensive Qi. Wang&#39;s commentary connects the defensive Qi with the Yang Qi of heaven and earth. </p>
<p>While the interpretation by Zhang Zhongjing of achieving non-self is indeed commendable, it is not entirely appropriate. For those suffering from miscellaneous ailments, can one blame solely the deficiency of Yang without considering the deficiency of Yin? I have observed that in cases of sweating during various illnesses, there are instances of both cold and hot sweat—there must be a reason for this. When heat evil invades the Yin deficiency, the resulting sweat is bound to be hot; meanwhile, when cold evil invades the Yang deficiency, the resulting sweat is bound to be cold. The explanation for cold sweat aligns with what the Inner Canon states, that when Yin prevails, the body is cold and sweating occurs, with clear fluid on the surface. This is not merely about spontaneous sweating; it applies to night sweats as well.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The meaning of sweating due to heat relates to the external manifestation of conditions like typhoid fever, where perspiration occurs due to internal heat. However, one must also consider the severity of the condition; excessive heat can harm the body and transform water into coolness. There are instances where fire from the kidneys carries water and turns into coolness, which must be carefully assessed. </p>
<p>According to Cheng Wuji in the “Essentials of the Golden Cabinet,” it is said that people with weak and thin pulses are prone to spontaneous sweating. Additionally, Chao’s “Sources of Illness” states that spontaneous sweating in those with chronic weakness is caused by Yang deficiency, thus implying that all instances of spontaneous sweating stem from a lack of Yang. However, if we refer back to the “Essentials of the Golden Cabinet,” a weak pulse indicates a deficiency in Yang qi, while a thin pulse indicates a deficiency in Yin qi. Why is it that only Yang is emphasized while Yin is neglected? This is a significant oversight of the learned.</p>
<p>Moreover, the illness of chronic weakness can arise in several ways: from a major illness where Yin qi hasn’t recovered and residual heat lingers; from labor or the desires tied to the seven emotions, which deplete Yin essence; or from foods and medicines that generate internal heat, all of which can harm Yin blood and exhaust the body’s energy. When Yin qi is deficient, it cannot support Yang, hence Yang qi evaporates internally, leading to persistent excessive sweating—this allows the Yang to survive without dispersing. </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of sweating can be categorized into two types: spontaneous sweating and night sweats. Spontaneous sweating occurs continuously without a specific time and increases with movement. Night sweats happen when the body sweats profusely during sleep and gradually subsides upon waking. Ancient texts suggest that spontaneous sweating is related to yang deficiency, where the protective layer is not secure. The body&#39;s protective energy (wei qi) should solidify the surface; if it is not secure, the surface weakens, leading to spontaneous sweating as fluids are expelled. The treatment should focus on strengthening the surface and supplementing yang.</p>
<p>On the other hand, night sweats are associated with yin deficiency. When yin is deficient, yang must compensate, which causes the yang to steam the yin components, leading to heat in the blood. When the blood is hot, fluids leak out as night sweats, thus the treatment should clear heat and replenish yin. This is the fundamental principle that should not be overlooked. However, from my observations, spontaneous sweating can also arise from yin deficiency, and night sweats may often indicate yang deficiency. For instance, when one experiences excessive heat or fatigue, spontaneous sweating is most common. Factors such as the heat generated from food in the stomach, fatigue-related heat from the spleen, and heat from alcohol and sexual activities can all cause spontaneous sweating. In such cases, can this be anything but a sign of excessive yang and declining yin?</p>
<p>Additionally, a person&#39;s sleep and wakefulness are influenced by the flow of protective energy, which is yang energy. During sleep, this energy enters the yin aspects; hence, this is a time when the surface is not yang-deficient. Therefore, both spontaneous sweating and night sweats each have signs of yin and yang, and one cannot simply conclude that spontaneous sweating is always a result of yang deficiency, nor that night sweats are always due to yin deficiency. </p>
<p>So, how do we discern the differences in yin and yang? The answer lies in observing the presence or absence of heat; whether it is yin or yang can be discerned this way. If sweating occurs due to excessive heat, it indicates that heat is consuming the yin, making yin deficiency evident.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who sweat without heat show that their qi is not stable, and their yang is deficient; this is evident. Understanding these two aspects, the essence of sweating becomes clear, and the methods for treatment can also be outlined. </p>
<p>Sweat originates from blood, which is based on yin. The classics say: the sweat of yang is named after the rain of heaven and earth; its meaning is understandable. However, sweat emerges from yin and is discharged through yang. Its root is the ying qi from within yin, while its opening and closing are governed by the wei qi of yang. Therefore, anyone wishing to promote sweating without understanding the rise and fall of ying and wei, or intending to prevent sweating without knowing the male and female aspects of the locking key, is akin to rowing a boat on land and driving a cart on the sea; I know they are bound to fail.</p>
<p>Sweating symptoms are categorized by yin and yang. Yang sweat is hot sweat; yin sweat is cold sweat. People only know that heat can induce sweating, but they do not realize that cold can also cause sweating.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The so-called coldness is not merely external cold; it arises from an internal deficiency of yang energy, leading to coldness emerging from within. When there is no yang in the yin, the yin has nothing to govern, causing sweat to escape with the qi. Therefore, whenever there is great shock or fear, it can lead to sweating; this is a sign of sudden depletion of yang energy and loss of true essence. In severe cases, such as after illness, childbirth, or significant vomiting, diarrhea, or blood loss, sweating often occurs—this is indeed a result of qi departing. Hence, the classics state: when yin prevails, the body becomes cold and sweaty, the body remains clear yet feels chilly, often shivering and resulting in cold extremities, which can lead to fullness in the abdomen and death. Zhongjing said: extreme cold can provoke sweating, and the body will be as cold as ice; this is all referred to as yin sweat. Thus, in treating yin sweat, one should simply observe the degree of qi deficiency. If the deficiency is slight, slightly support the vital energy, and the sweat will naturally cease; if the deficiency is severe, it is essential to urgently restore the vital energy, using substances like ginger, cinnamon, and aconite, which must be employed.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For Yang conditions with sweating or night sweats, one should observe the pulse and symptoms for signs of fire, such as night heat with thirst, or a preference for cold with hot stools; these indicate a Yang excess and Yin deficiency. The first choice for treatment should be the Gui Gui Liu Huang Tang, and the Bai Yin Jian is also effective. If there is a slight fire in the Yin aspect but not severe, one should use the Yi Yin Jian, or modify the Yi Yin Jian as necessary. If there is unrest from heart fire, leading to irritability and sweating, one should treat with Zhu Sha An Shen Wan, Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan, or Sheng Mai San. Additionally, if the sweating is not due to Yin deficiency but rather from internal fire and blood heat, one should use the Zheng Qi Tang, or Huang Qin Shao Yao Tang, or Qing Hua Yin. For Yin conditions with sweating or night sweats, if there is no internal fire and no fiery pulse, it simply indicates Qi deficiency. In Yin conditions, one should not recklessly use cooling medicines, as they can harm the Yang energy.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If sweating is caused by deficiency of qi while the fire is not yet diminished, one should use formulas like San Yin Jian, Shen Gui Tang, or Ren Shen Jian Zhong Tang. If there is sleeping night sweat without fire, one should use formulas like Shen Ling San or Du Shen Tang. If both yang and qi are deficient, formulas like Shen Fu Tang or Da Jian Zhong Tang should be used. If qi is deficient and fire has severely diminished, one should employ formulas like Da Bu Yuan Jian or Liu Wei Hui Yang Yin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sweating and Chills</strong></p>
<p>Sweating and chills are different; sweating arises from the external, while chills come from the internal. When someone with a cold wants to relieve it, if their vital energy is strong internally, then the evil cannot compete with it. However, when sweating occurs without effort, this is known as non-battle, indicating that the body is not deficient. If a person is inherently weak, and the evil struggles with the righteous, the minor symptoms would cause chills, while severe cases lead to sweating. If the righteous overcomes the evil, then sweating will resolve the condition. Therefore, any struggle between the evil and the righteous occurring externally is called a battle, indicating recovery; while a struggle between evil and righteous internally results in chills, which is more severe. It is said: When the evil dominates within, there must be chills. Sweating signifies the restoration of vital energy, while chills indicate that evil energy is rampant. Thus, if someone suffers from a cold for six to seven days and only experiences chills without sweating, they may develop a reverse cold condition that is very hard to treat. This results from weakness in vital energy and the internal dominance of yin evil, where the righteous do not overcome the evil, leading to the evil prevailing instead. In such cases, it is essential to use powerful warming tonics and rescue yang methods, among others; how else can one counter it?<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Sweating</strong></p>
<p>There are two conditions for head sweating: one is due to evil heat obstructing upward, and the other is the internal loss of yang energy. The head is where all yang energies converge. When someone suffers from full-body sweating due to a cold, it is referred to as heat spreading upwards. If there is no sweating from the body, the heat does not disperse and rises to disturb the yang aspect, resulting in only head sweating. The treatment for heat steaming can be either purifying or dispersing; in severe cases, purgation may be needed to eliminate the heat and allow the condition to resolve itself. In the case of energy loss, it is often due to reckless purgation injuring the yin, excessive depletion, or continuous diarrhea, leading to the exhaustion of yin below and the loss of yang above. When there is difficulty in urination and head sweating occurs, it signals great danger.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For head sweating with a tight and rapid pulse, indicating an exterior evil that should be dispersed, Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) is appropriate, or Chai Hu Gui Zhi Gan Jiang Tang (Bupleurum and Cinnamon Twig Decoction) and various new formulas with Chai Hu can also be used as needed. If there is a fire evil, with a broad and slippery pulse and internal fever, head sweating should be cleared with Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang (Ginseng Powdered White Tiger Decoction) or Yi Yuan San (Benefit Source Powder). If there is water retention in the chest, with fullness under the heart and head sweating, either Da Xian Xiong Tang (Major Sinking Chest Decoction) or Xiao Ban Xia Fu Ling Tang (Minor Pinellia and Poria Decoction) can be used. If there are hard stools, abdominal distension, pain, and head sweating, Cheng Qi Tang (Regulate Qi Decoction) is indicated. For various forms of deficiency, diarrhea, and head sweating with yang loss, Du Shen Tang (Ginseng Decoction) or Da Bu Yuan Jian (Greatly Tonifying Source Decoction) and Liu Wei Hui Yang (Six-Ingredient Restore Yang Decoction) can serve as emergency remedies. This may help preserve life.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　大汗之病，阳气尽随汗而外越，若不急为止抑，则阳气立散，即时身死。法当以大补之剂煎饮，一线之气可留，而大汗可止。方用人参一两，或黄芪二两代之，当归一两，北五味一钱，桑叶七片，急为煎服。此方即补血汤之变，妙在补气药多于补血，使气旺则血自生，血生则汗可止。况方中加五味子以收汗，如桑叶以止汗，有不相得益彰者乎？倘以大汗之人，气必大喘，不可以参芪重增其气，纯用补血之品，末为无见。然而血不可骤生，气所当急固，不顾气，徒补血，未见功成。此似是而非，又不可不急辨之也。　　凡人无论有病无病，一旦汗如雨出不肯止者，名曰亡阳。汗尽止有气未绝，最危之证也。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Illness of Great Sweating</p>
<p>When a person suffers from great sweating, the yang energy dissipates alongside the sweat. If not urgently restrained, the yang energy will scatter, resulting in immediate death. The remedy should consist of a potent restorative decoction. If the vital energy is preserved, the excessive sweating can be stopped. One should use one ounce of ginseng, or replace it with two ounces of astragalus; one ounce of angelica, one-tenth of an ounce of North Schisandra berries, and seven pieces of mulberry leaves, and decoct this urgently for consumption. This formula is a variation of the Blood Supplementing Decoction, notable for having more Qi-tonifying herbs than blood-nourishing ones, allowing the Qi to flourish so that the blood can be generated. With the blood generated, sweating can cease. Furthermore, the inclusion of Schisandra berries helps to retain sweat, just as mulberry leaves help to stop sweating; there are complementary benefits here. </p>
<p>However, in the case of someone experiencing great sweating, the breath must be labored; one cannot simply increase Qi with ginseng and astragalus heavily. Purely relying on blood-replenishing substances will yield limited results. Yet blood cannot be generated abruptly, and the urgent need is for the Qi. Ignoring the Qi and solely focusing on replenishing the blood will not yield success. This distinction must be urgently made.</p>
<p>In general, whether a person is ill or not, if they suddenly sweat profusely and cannot stop, it is termed loss of yang. Once sweat has ceased but there remains some vital energy, it indicates a critical condition.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If sweating arises and one uses medicine to stop the sweat, then the sweating cannot be stopped. If sweating is excessive and one uses blood-tonifying medicine, then blood will not quickly regenerate. The urgent matter is to replenish the qi, which can still be restored. However, among qi-tonifying medicines, ginseng truly cannot be substituted for anything else. One should use the Sweat-Collecting and Yang-Replenishing Decoction, which includes one tael each of ginseng, astragalus, ophiopogon, and cooked rehmannia, three qian of north five-flavor fruit, five qian each of angelica and roasted jujube seed, and one qian of licorice, boiled in water to take. After one dose, the sweating will cease; after two doses, the qi will be restored; after three doses, the qi will be vigorous; after four doses, the body will be healthy. The essence of this formula lies in the balanced replenishment of qi and blood, especially focusing on qi, which provides enough energy to generate yang. When yang is abundant, yin will also be produced. In cases of yang deficiency, although yang is lost, in fact, it is due to yin deficiency that cannot contain yang, resulting in the loss of yang qi. If yin were sufficient to contain yang, then even if sweating occurs, there would be no loss of yang. However, in treating yang deficiency, how can one only seek to restore yang? One must restore both yang and yin. </p>
<p>Profuse sweating necessitates the use of qi-tonifying medicine to rescue the condition of yang deficiency. However, if qi-tonifying medicine is overused, there is still a fear that yang will become exuberant while yin dissipates. After taking several doses of qi-tonifying medicine, it is advisable to shift to tonifying yin products. Moreover, after the loss of yang, yin and blood are indeed depleted, so providing water-tonifying medicine corresponds perfectly to this situation. When yin is stabilized, yang will flourish, eliminating the issue of one side being overly dominant.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Head Sweating</strong></p>
<p>When a person&#39;s head sweats, it is due to an excess of kidney fire and a deficiency of kidney water. If one does not understand the reason and merely uses sweat-stopping medicines, it will surely lead to dizziness and ear pain. The method should be to nourish the kidneys and clear the source of lung transformation, which will naturally be effective. The prescription includes one pound of mulberry leaves, two pounds of cooked rehmannia, three taels of north five-flavor herb, and six taels of ophiopogon, all ground into powder, then formed into pills with honey. Take five qian or one liang daily with hot water, and after a month, sweating will cease forever.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is excessive head sweating during meals, it is due to excess stomach fire rather than residual kidney fire. The method here should incorporate one pound each of scrophularia, ophiopogon, tian dong, and raw rehmannia, four taels of north five-flavor herb, and half a pound of sour jujube seed, all ground into powder and formed into pills with honey. Take one liang daily with hot water, and one will certainly recover within two months.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It seems that stomach fire is somewhat dominant, and bamboo leaf gypsum decoction is recommended, but why do I prefer not to use it? It is because the stomach fire is only slightly elevated, not intensely raging and fiery, merely because of the flavors from food entering the stomach, leading to slight perspiration. Once the meal is finished, the sweating also ceases. Therefore, resolving it with just a single ingredient like Scrophularia is sufficient. Furthermore, using ingredients like Tianma, two types of Dong, to clear lung fire, and Shengdi to cool the blood, as well as Suanzaoren to calm heart fire and Wuweizi to control sweating and nourish fluids, will also diminish the stomach&#39;s fiery state, especially since it was not excessively strong to begin with. This is one method of moderation. The sweat from the hands is a minor issue, and there&#39;s no need to involve this treatment; washing them with water would suffice. </p>
<p>For the hand sweating, one would use one ounce each of Astragalus and Kudzu, and three qian each of Schizonepeta and Ledebouriella, boiling them in water to prepare a basin of decoction, then steaming and washing the hands three times while warm, which will eliminate the sweat—a marvelous remedy. This decoction can be used this way, but it is even better to change the herbs daily.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<p>Tiaowei Decoction [from Dong Yuan] treats excess damp leading to spontaneous sweating, supplements weak Wei qi, and addresses exterior deficiency that cannot withstand cold. Huangqi and Ma Huang root each one qian, fresh licorice leaf, Angelica leaf, fresh Huangqin, Banxia washed seven times, each five fen; Polyporus and Qianghuo each seven fen; Maidengdong with the heart removed, fresh Dihuang each three fen; Schisandra seeds seven seeds; Suomu and Honghua each one fen. Grind as large as a soybean, make one dose, with two cups of water, simmer to one cup, strain and take warm. In cases of stroke, spontaneous sweating must be treated with caution as excessive sweating shouldn&#39;t be induced again, hence the use of Ma Huang is restricted to its root.

<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Life Preservation&quot; states that for spontaneous and nocturnal sweating, one should first focus on the navel, envisioning fire circulating within, then cover the navel with the hands while imagining a stream of water descending from the navel, moving down to the bladder and tips of the tailbone, and then to the back, emerging from the heart to cleanse it. There is no need to use the method of guiding water under the navel if there is no loss of essence. Spontaneous sweating without cause is a result of excessive heat; hence, one must lower the fire and elevate the water to stop the sweating.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot;: In April of the Ren Yin year, Zhang Yun experienced cold and rainy weather mixed with dampness. Poor diet and excessive labor due to official matters resulted in an illness that led to prolonged sweating. After recovery, he continued to sweat without stopping for several days and felt severe chills, demanding thicker clothing. He experienced tightness in the chest, restlessness, intermittent fever, dizziness, and food reduction. This was due to excessive external Yin fire from the stomach, compounded by moist heat from the rain, which intensified the accumulation of moist heat, resulting in persistent sweating. Furthermore, a wind pathogen coupled with the elements of the eastern auspicious direction contributed to his condition. Wind herbs were used to alleviate dryness, and sweet herbs were used to purge heat. The Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction was the main prescription, and just one dose alleviated all symptoms.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure&quot; states: In the 46th year of age, Duke Wu of Zhen Ding, during the third month of the Bingzi year of the Yuan dynasty, fell ill due to worry and overwork, resulting in irregular eating habits. His limbs were cold, and his breath was cool in his mouth and nose. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead, and he often felt dizzy, with his six pulses thin like a spider&#39;s thread. One physician diagnosed a wind condition and attempted to treat it with a wind-dispersing powder. I recalled that in Qian&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Children,&quot; it was mentioned that a child&#39;s internal injury to the spleen and stomach could lead to either vomiting or diarrhea, and if prolonged, wind evil could invade the stomach, causing diarrhea and a bound condition. This might lead to lingering surprise, thus the wind-dispersing powder would expel the wind evil. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that prolonged wind can cause diarrhea—that is exactly the case. Now, with Duke Wu&#39;s physical symptoms, it is a condition of excessive Yin and deficient Yang, and bitter-cold medicines are not appropriate. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says that excessive Yin leads to profuse sweating and coldness. Moreover, the treatise on the correspondence between Yin and Yang states that when Yin is excessive, the body becomes cold, sweating occurs, the body feels persistently cool, and one experiences chills. Coldness causes dysfunction. The &quot;Regulation of the Menstrual Cycle&quot; also states that excessive Yin generates internal cold. Qi Bo said that reverse Qi rises and cold accumulates in the chest without relieving itself; if it does not relieve, warm Qi leaves, and cold remains, thus causing internal cold. Dongyuan explains that this indicates insufficient spleen and stomach energy due to overwork, leading to illness in the middle burner, transmitting cold inward, and thus only yang should be supplemented. Therefore, I prescribed the &quot;Li Zhong Decoction&quot; with added black aconite, taking five qian for each dose, and recommended the broth of lamb cooked with scallions, taking one large cup of the clear juice to mix and consume. By evening, his limbs gradually warmed, and he perspired slightly. Late at night, he took a second dose, and by the next day, his spirit was restored, with six pulses strong; after several doses, he was cured.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

In the eleventh month of the 丁卯 year of the Yuan dynasty, due to labor and worries, he became ill from stress, losing his appetite and adversely affecting his health. He experienced restlessness, a feverish body, fatigue in his limbs, and profuse sweating that soaked his blankets. He had no desire to eat, his breath was weak, and his complexion was pale and yellow. I was asked to treat him and he provided details of his previous conditions. Upon examining his pulse, it was floating, rapid, and short, with two inches very small. I warned that this was a dangerous condition; although treatment might be simple, he would surely die by spring, and I advised his in-laws to be aware of this. The lady did not believe it and subsequently changed doctors. By the first month, he succumbed to his illness due to heat and distress.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says: The master prevails over the inverse, while the guest prevails in acquiescence; this is the way of Heaven. Indeed, the seasons are the guest, while the human body is the master. During the three months of winter, everyone fears the cold, yet there are those who are restless and hot, sweating excessively. This causes their Yang to not be firmly retained, and the season cannot overcome their heat. If even the time and seasons cannot be controlled, how can medicine help? Winter is the month of closure and storage. The Yang energy should lie dormant beneath the nine springs until spring arrives with thunder, stirring everything into movement, which is the way of nurturing life. If the winter storage is not secure, then the spring growth will be weak, leading to epidemics and calamities. Moreover, the Yang energy of the human body should also lie dormant within, not to be recklessly disturbed, nor should the skin be allowed to leak, causing Qi to be rapidly depleted; this is the response to winter storage. Allowing sweat to flow during the month of closure and storage means the kidney water has already dried up; how can life flourish in spring? If the Yang energy within is severed, there is nothing to nourish and flourish—how can one survive? The two gentlemen then sighed and departed.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

After half a year, if not blood in the stools, then there was night sweating; if not experiencing cold chills, then there was fever. The two treatments of blood and sweat had no effect; the six pulses were floating and large, while the heart and spleen were depleted. This resulted from overthinking, which harmed the heart and spleen, causing an inability to contain blood and restore it to its source. However, blood is indeed sweat, and sweat is blood; their colors, red and dark, indicate minor or severe fluctuations of fire. Chills and fever indicated a deficiency of both qi and blood. Thus, in the morning, I employed a restorative formula to tonify the middle and augment qi, aiming to strengthen the source of the spleen and lungs and lift the sinking qi; in the afternoon, I used Gui Pi (Return the Spleen) with black and five flavors, to nourish the blood of the heart and spleen, consolidating the dispersed fluids. Within two months, all symptoms completely resolved.</p>
<p>Xia Bao Gu Ren, aged sixty-one, after suffering from dysentery, experienced involuntary semen leakage for two days before it ceased.

Using two doses of tonifying medicine further aggravated the condition; his pulse was floating, large, and rapid, but when examined, it was weak and thin. This indicated a fire-less, deficient heat, so I urgently prescribed a formula of Ten Complete Powders, adding dioscorea, dogwood, peony, and prepared aconite, after which all symptoms suddenly improved and he was restored to health.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar suffered from a dry mouth and fever, frequent and turbid urination, constipation, nocturnal sweating, and nocturnal emissions, which led to insomnia. I prescribed two doses of Danggui Liuhuang Decoction, and the nocturnal sweating immediately stopped. I then used Liuwei Dihuang Pill to regulate his urination and bowel movements. After taking a decoction of Shiquan Dabu Decoction along with the previous pill for over a month, he was completely cured. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue,&quot; it says: I once treated an elderly man over seventy who suddenly suffered from a cold infection. Initially, I used warming and tonifying methods. After ten days, when his vital energy was about to recover, he unexpectedly had a gastrointestinal crisis—fighting violently from dawn until 9 AM without being able to sweat, experiencing severe chills and danger, and urgently called for me. I administered Liuwei Huayang Decoction with one tael of ginseng and three qian each of ginger and aconite, making him take it as a brew. After a brief time, he broke out in sweat, as if bathed. By noon, he was drenched in sweat and could hardly recover, feeling cold as if he were dead, with almost no breath. I was informed of this again. I commanded that the previous medicine be brewed again for him, but the messenger said: &quot;He has already sweated profusely from this medicine; can he endure more sweating with another dose?&quot; I laughed and said: &quot;There is a principle in this that you do not understand.&quot; I insisted on administering it again, and this led to the cessation of sweating and the recovery of his spirit. Within a few days, he was up and about. Alas! Using this method to induce sweating and to subsequently stop sweating may lead people to doubt its efficacy. However, they do not realize that both the emergence and cessation of sweat are controlled by the vital energy. Therefore, I record this to allow people to understand that the power of contraction and expansion does not lie merely in the ability to release or retrieve but in what governs it.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

This is more pronounced in cases with excessive sweating and dampness. When Yang energy is deficient and Yin energy is excessive, the two energies interact, resulting in sweating and dampness.

If sweat appears externally, it can cause skin issues like furuncles and rash. Sweating in the wind can lead to coldness and result in itching; internal stagnation may then cause furuncles. If the spirit's sweat is not fully released, the body becomes weak and the Qi can dissipate. The acupuncture points may be blocked, leading to wind-heat conditions. When sweat causes one side of the body to feel damp, it indicates that the Yang Qi is weak and cannot circulate freely, resulting in localized debilitation. Visible sweating indicates damp heat is accumulating in the skin, leading to furuncles and rashes. Laboring excessively while sweating in the wind can trap cold dampness in the skin, causing itching.

The Foot Yangming channel governs blood-related diseases, such as mania, intermittent fever, and profuse sweating. This is because the stomach controls nourishment and blood; hence it governs blood-related diseases, causing madness and hot intermittent fevers with sweating, which occurs when stomach qi is hot and vaporizes bodily fluids into sweat. The Hand Shaoyang channel governs diseases related to qi, resulting in sweating. The Shaoyang represents the initial emergence of yang energy, and sweating occurs when yang manifests above yin. The Foot Shaoyang channel governs diseases related to the bones, which also causes sweating. When the six yang energies are exhausted, yin and yang separate.

This sweating does not follow the pathway of the defensive qi; what is the reason? Qi Bo answered: This is due to an external injury from wind, which opens the pores, causing the hair to evaporate and allow the defensive qi to escape, thus it cannot follow its proper pathway. This qi is fierce, slippery, and rapid, and when it is opened, it escapes, hence it is called leakage. The defensive qi flows from the upper jiao; the pathway it follows has never reached the face or the back. Now, when food has just entered the stomach, and the essence of the nutritive and defensive qi is not yet defined, sweating may occur first on the face or on the back. This is the defensive qi not following its path. The defensive qi spreads throughout the body, without failing to nourish any part. If sweating occurs from the midsection, it is a deviation of the defensive qi. The defensive qi is the fierce qi of food and fluids, its nature being fierce, slippery, and rapid; if the pores are not tightly closed, it will escape as soon as they open, hence it cannot follow its path. The nutritive and defensive qi represent the refined essence. Blood represents the vital essence. Hence, blood and qi are different names for the same category. Thus, if blood is lost, there is no sweat; if sweat is lost, there is no blood. The nutritive and defensive qi arise from the essence of food and liquid. Blood is transformed from the vital essence. Both blood and the nutritive and defensive qi arise from essence, thus they are different names but belong to the same category.

The formula for treatment is a decoction of astragalus, peony, cinnamon, and wine. The illness of yellow sweat manifests with cold in the lower legs. Even if there is fever, this is related to the seasonal changes. If sweating occurs after eating, followed by night sweats, this indicates a deficiency in nourishment and energy. If sweating occurs and then fever returns, and this continues for a long time, the body will have misalignments, and persistent fever will surely lead to the development of sores.

Whenever there is sweat on the head, it indicates that the five internal organs are dried out, the membranes are empty, and fluids are minimal; careful attention must be paid to avoid purging.

A submerged pulse also indicates an interior issue. Sweating signifies mild yang; if pure yin were to be blocked, there would be no external symptoms, and everything would descend into the interior, indicating a situation half in the interior and half in the exterior. Although the pulse may be submerged and tight, it cannot be regarded as a condition of lesser yin. The reason for this is that yin cannot produce sweat; since there is sweating on the forehead, it is known not to be lesser yin. For cold damage lasting five to six days, after sweating has occurred, if there is fullness in the chest and hypochondria, slight blockage, difficult urination, thirst without vomiting, but only sweating on the forehead, this means the exterior is not yet resolved. The patient is likely suffering from stagnant heat in the interior, and the body will likely turn yellow. In cases of yang brightness disease, after treatment, if there is heat in the exterior, warm hands and feet, no chest blockage, vexation in the heart, and hunger without the ability to eat, but only sweating on the forehead—this is also noteworthy.

If only head sweat occurs, one should needle the Qimen point and based on the situation, let it drain; once sweating occurs, recovery follows. Concerning spontaneous sweating in febrile diseases, how is it understood? Spontaneous sweating refers to sweating that occurs naturally, without being induced by external dispersal. The \"Inner Canon\" states that Yang Qi protects the exterior, providing firmness. The protective Qi guards the skin, ensuring the pores are full and preventing fluids from leaking. When sweating occurs, it expels evil qi. If the protective Qi is inadequate and cannot maintain firmness, the skin loosens and the pores become too open, leading to the unwanted leakage of fluids, which results in spontaneous sweating. If a person has a fever and sweats without recovery, it indicates disharmony in the protective Qi, with Wind evil interfering with it. If one has heat stroke with sweating, a sensation of chill, body heat, and thirst, it indicates Summer evil interfering with the protective Qi. When there’s excessive sweating and dampness, it is due to excessive Wind-Damp evil interfering with the protective Qi. Thus, it is understood that protective Qi secures fluids, preventing their unwarranted leakage; it is always due to the interference of evil Qi that sweating begins. The poisons of Wind, Cold, Summer, and Dampness are the atmospheric evils of the four seasons, which cause febrile diseases in individuals. Both Wind and Summer-Dampness are evils that induce spontaneous sweating. However, Cold alone harms the body without causing sweating. Cold injures the nutrients but does not harm the protective Qi; when there is no interference from evil Qi, the skin remains tight, and the fluids stay intact, which is why sweating does not occur."},{"anchor":"trans-20p","marker":"20p","type":"translation","text":"As the qi gradually enters the interior and transforms into heat, it also leads to spontaneous sweating. This occurs because when there is heat, the protective and nutritive qi communicate, the pores open, and sweat is released. However, signs of spontaneous sweating also have distinctions between exterior and interior, and differences between deficiency and excess. If there is sweating accompanied by aversion to wind or slight aversion to cold, this indicates that the exterior has not yet resolved and one must wait for dispersal before recovery. In cases where the sweating does not stop and there is aversion to wind, or if there is aversion to cold after sweating, this indicates a deficiency in the exterior; one must wait for warming of the channels to recover. All these are instances where pathogenic qi is present on the exterior. If the sweating occurs without aversion to cold, this indicates that the exterior has resolved but the interior is still unharmonized. The classics say: When the Yangming causes fever and sweat, it is called heat surpassing. They also say: If the Yangming disease has fever and abundant sweating, it must be urgently purged. This is not the same as sweating that occurs due to pathogenic qi on the exterior, which can be mitigated. Spontaneous sweating in cases of cold damage is common. If sweating occurs and feels oily or is as large as beads, or if sweat emerges without flowing, these are signs of a condition that cannot be treated. It is essential for both hands and feet to be warm and the entire body to be moist, gently perspiring for a time until the heat dissipates and the body cools and harmonizes; this is the ideal condition. This reflects the harmony of yin and yang, the rise of water and the descent of fire, the flow of nutritive and protective qi, and the exit and resolution of pathogenic qi.

Night sweats refer to sweating during sleep. Spontaneous sweating may occur whether one is asleep or awake, arising naturally. Night sweats, however, cannot occur without sleep; they manifest only when asleep, and stop upon waking. In instances of mixed diseases causing night sweats, one attributes it to Yang deficiency. The night sweats due to cold injury are not the same deficiency as in mixed diseases; rather, they result from pathogenic influences being present both internally and externally. How so? If the pathogenic influence were purely external, it would naturally cause sweating by affecting the defensive (Wei) Qi. In this case, the pathogenic influence can penetrate the interior while still connected to the exterior. During sleep, the defensive Qi operates inwardly, while the Yang Qi at the surface is insufficient, leading to the loss of fluid, hence sweating during sleep; upon waking, the Qi disperses outward and the sweating ceases. The classics say: \"If slight night sweats occur accompanied by chills and aversion to cold, the exterior has not yet resolved.\" Additionally, in Yangming disease, if there is a need for the interior to be full while the pulse is floating, it indicates night sweats, which suggests the presence of external pathogens. Moreover, in cases of simultaneous Yang syndromes, one may notice spontaneous sweating. This illustrates that night sweats arise from a pathogenic influence situated between the surface and the interior. Furthermore, spontaneous sweating can arise from both deficiency (vacuity) and excess (repletion).

The head is where all the Yang channels converge. When pathogenic factors invade the Yang, and the fluids gather upwards, sweating occurs on the head. If internal heat accumulates and evaporates through the pores, causing sweating all over the body, this is referred to as excess heat. If there is no sweating from the body, then the heat does not escape. When heat steams in the Yang, only sweating from the head occurs. Why is this? Because the channels of the three Yin run up to the neck and chest and then return, without following to the head; only the Yang channels ascend to the head. The scripture states: if sweating occurs only on the head, and not on the body, and it returns to the neck, with difficulty in urination and thirst for water, this indicates that stagnant heat resides within, and the body must turn yellow, as the heat cannot ascend upwards. Additionally, if heat enters the blood chamber, causing vexation, or if the Yangming is consumed by fire, or if water accumulates in the chest, all result in sweating from the head; these too are due to internal heat stagnation and inability to escape. In these instances, whether by vomiting or purging, the aim is to eliminate the heat. Some might say that the symptoms of head sweating belong entirely to Yangming and represent internal heat, but could there be cases not associated with Yangming but rather with the exterior? It is also the case that when the pathogens are only on the surface, there are no symptoms of head sweating.

For those with dampness, only sweating on the forehead, desiring to be covered and facing the fire indicates a struggle between cold and dampness, leading to sweating on the forehead as well. All these conditions are provoked by pathogenic influences causing natural sweating on the forehead, and should not be interpreted as a reversal. If urination is not smooth, it is adverse to find sweating on the forehead; for those with dampness, after purging, it is also adverse to see sweating on the forehead. These two conditions are what constitute the reversal of sweating on the forehead. Why is this? Because difficulty in urination creates a blockage; when sweating on the forehead occurs, it indicates yang collapse. The classic states: When blockage prevents urination, if there is no sweat on the head, there is survival, but if there is sweating, there is death. For those with dampness, if sweating appears on the forehead and there is slight gasping, it also indicates yang collapse. The classic states: For those with dampness and purging, if sweating appears on the forehead and urination is difficult, they die; if there is continuous diarrhea, they also die. The \"Pulse Classic\" says: When yang energy rises and sweat appears on the head, it signifies yang collapse.

The limbs are the foundation of all Yang, and the stomach governs the limbs. Sweating in the hands and feet is a manifestation of Yangming. When the Yang channels are affected by heat, it leads to sweating in the hands and feet. Yangming is also the master of bodily fluids; hence, spontaneous sweating occurs. Those who experience sweating all over the body, only on the head, or specifically in the hands and feet all belong to the category of Yangming. Why does this happen? If there is sweating all over the body, it is said to be \"heat excess,\" indicating heat reaching the surface. If sweating occurs only on the head, it means the heat cannot escape, and the heat rises upwards. When sweating is confined to the hands and feet, it indicates that heat is concentrated in the stomach, affecting the fluids. The record states: when hands and feet sweat profusely, the stool must be difficult; when they sweat a little, and the stool is hard with aphasia, purging will lead to recovery. From this, it is clear that sweating in the hands and feet indicates heat accumulation in the stomach.

The record states: when cold is in the Yangming, one cannot eat, urination is difficult, and there is profuse sweating in the hands and feet, this points to the desire to develop a mass, showing that it is indeed cold accumulation. Moreover, heat accumulation in the stomach signifies a condition that can be purged, while cold accumulation indicates one that cannot. How can this be clarified? To differentiate both conditions, it must be noted that if the stool initially is hard and later becomes soft, it signifies that the stomach is cold, leading to a lack of separation between food and drink, which is why purging is not appropriate.

The pores (腠理) are where fluids exude and converge, while the meridians (理) are the junctions where patterns meet. Fluids can be affected by wind, heat, and dampness; when they accumulate at the skin's surface, sweat is produced. However, if a cold pathogen penetrates the channels and compresses the pores, there will be no sweat as fluids cannot seep out. The lack of sweat can arise from several conditions: if the cold damage remains superficial or the pathogen moves inward, or if water-damp accumulates internally, or from a prolonged deficiency of yang. All these can lead to an absence of sweat, indicating that the pores are tightly closed. When wind is caught in the defensive (卫), the pores open and sweating occurs. Conversely, when cold penetrates to the nutritive (荣), sweating does not occur, signifying the closure of the pores. The classics discuss conditions such as \"sun disease with aversion to wind, no sweat, and wheezing,\" along with signs of a floating, tight pulse without sweat and fever, restlessness without sweating, as well as yangming disease presenting with no sweat but frequent urination, vomiting, and coughing over two to three days, along with cold extremities and headache, a dry nose, and an inability to sweat. All these patterns indicate the presence of a cold pathogen at the surface leading to a lack of sweating.

In cases of the three Yin conditions where sweating does not occur, these symptoms indicate that evil is acting internally without producing sweat. The accumulation of fluids within the body, without sweating, leads to the formation of phlegm and bodily fluids; when fluids are retained internally and fail to flow, there will be insufficient bodily fluids to produce sweat. Regarding the prescription of Gui Zhi Decoction or purgatives, if there is still persistent headache, heat sensation, and no sweating, along with fullness and slight pain beneath the heart, and difficult urination, one should modify the formula by removing cinnamon and adding Fuling and Baizhu. This is again due to the infiltration of bodily fluids without producing sweat. If there is Yang deficiency without sweating, Yang is the master of bodily fluids; when Yang is deficient, the bodily fluids become insufficient, resulting in no sweating. The text further explains that a floating and slow pulse indicates absence of Yang, which cannot produce sweat, leading to itching of the body. In Yangming disease, when there is no sweating, the skin may feel as if insects are crawling beneath it, which is a sign of prolonged deficiency; thus, it is all due to Yang deficiency and lack of sweating. This reasoning aligns with the principles of medicine; how could it be considered different? If a person should sweat but does not, and after taking one dose of herbal decoction the symptoms persist, then if after three doses there is still no sweating, this is considered a critical illness. Additionally, in cases of heat illness with a rapid pulse where sweating is absent, Huangdi declares this to be at the extreme of Yang pulse, indicating death.

According to the \"Inner Canon,\" the heart alone governs, yet Dong Yuan also refers to the spleen and stomach—why is that? It is because the heart, being the sovereign fire, governs heat, while the spleen and stomach, governed by earth, control moisture. The combination of moisture and heat leads to sweat. Similarly, the earth’s humidity rises as clouds and mist; if the heavens do not provide rain, it cannot accumulate into a downpour. It is also like liquor being heated in a steamer; without boiling and steaming, it cannot become liquid sweat. Each organ can cause sweating, but the heart and the spleen-stomach specifically govern moisture and heat, thus they are the main controllers. Therefore, the classics also state: when one has eaten excessively, sweat emerges from the stomach. In shock, one loses essence, and sweat emerges from the heart. Carrying heavy loads over long distances, sweat emerges from the kidneys. Running in fear, sweat emerges from the liver. Exhaustion from labor causes sweat to emerge from the spleen.

Spontaneous perspiration occurs incessantly, worsened by movement, and belongs to yang deficiency; it is governed by the protective qi. Night sweats, on the other hand, occur while sleeping, making the body feel drenched, stopping only upon awakening; it relates to yin deficiency and is governed by the nutritious blood. Generally, spontaneous perspiration should be treated by tonifying yang and regulating the protective qi, whereas night sweats should be addressed by nourishing yin and lowering fire.

If sweating occurs with pathogenic heat and the person is not thirsty, the best remedy is a modified Xiao Chai Hu decoction with half a qian of cinnamon twig. To treat heart deficiency with excessive sweating and insomnia, take one wild boar's heart, cut it open while still bleeding, and add two taels of ginseng and two taels of angelica.

More sweat on the forehead is because the left cheek pertains to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the nose to the middle burner, the mandible to the kidneys, and the forehead to the heart. The fire of the triple burner exhausts the kidney water, and what remains is forced upward into the heart region; therefore, it manifests as head sweat, and the excess on the forehead belongs to the heart category as a blood condition. If head sweat appears after drinking wine or consuming food, it is also a blood condition. As for mixed conditions, when the fire of the heart pushes the kidney water upward into the heart, it causes night sweats or spontaneous sweating, which may lead to head sweat or a sensation of fullness in the heart area; all these are treated similarly as blood conditions. Regardless of whether there are cold damage or mixed diseases from wine accumulation, if there is a sense of fullness under the heart, it indicates a blood condition. Why is that? It is said: If one purges and loses Yin, losing Yin means damaging the spleen and stomach and losing blood, with Qi trapped in the chest, leading to diminished blood and consequent fullness in the heart area. Thus, it feels full under the heart. People believe that blood diseases should utilize Qi medicine to guide it, but this exacerbates the fullness issue, and if purged again, it transforms into a sensation of bloating—not the proper treatment.

This indicates a deficiency of yang energy in defense. For excessive sweating due to heat, one should use the \"Supplementing the Middle and Enhancing Qi Decoction\" with added Ephedra root and Floating Wheat. Elevating agents such as Rhubarb and Cinnamon should be stir-fried with honey to mitigate their uplifting nature, and they should guide Ginseng and Astragalus to the skin's surface, hence they are essential.

If there is excessive sweating with a soft body, this indicates dampness. The heart governs heat, and the spleen governs dampness; when damp-heat clashes, it is like the moisture of the earth that condenses into clouds, mist, or rain.

However, the sweating from these two conditions differs in terms of temperature. If cold qi invades due to yang deficiency, the sweat produced will certainly be cold; if hot qi invades due to yin deficiency, the sweat will certainly be hot. Nonetheless, excessive heat can injure and transform into cold, which should also not be neglected.

Sweat is the essence of the heart, and the condition of spontaneous sweating arises from both the heart and kidneys being deficient. Therefore, when yin and yang are deficient, the pores will open and cause heat, leading to spontaneous sweating. This is fundamentally due to the imbalance of yin and yang. Additionally, conditions such as wind injury, heat stroke, dampness, fright, excessive sexual activity, extreme fatigue, seasonal changes, intestinal abscesses, phlegm and fluid accumulation, and postpartum conditions can also cause spontaneous sweating. Zhongjing noted that when the flesh is exhausted, bodily fluids escape, the pores open, and sweat pours out. Chao's commentary states that in cases of deficient labor, if yang energy is significantly deficient, the fluids will disperse as sweat. It is also said that heat in the heart will open the pores, and when the pores open, sweating occurs. The various explanations from different schools regarding sweating generally align with this understanding. Upon investigation, it is realized that sweat is a discharge of bodily fluids. Fluids and qi are similar in nature; where qi reaches, fluids inevitably follow. Therefore, the statement in the \"Inner Canon\" that the heart is linked to sweat is of great significance! The heart is the governing organ of yang, and yang represents fire and qi; thus, all the yang of the five organs and six bowels is overseen by the heart to facilitate its transformations."},{"anchor":"trans-40p","marker":"40p","type":"translation","text":"Therefore, fluid production follows the location of the yang energy and also corresponds to where the fire disturbance occurs, leading to sweating, which ultimately exits through the heart. Otherwise, why would the \"Inner Canon\" mention wind, labor, and the struggle between yin and yang, with sweat emerging from various organs? The five internal organs and six hollow organs must rely on the meridians for nourishment and defense, as the meridians serve as pathways for the movement of qi. The nourishment meridian nourishes yin and blood, while the defensive meridian secures yang energy. When yang energy is firm, the pores are healthy, the original cavity is secure, and the connections between the organs and meridians are seamless. If the internal organs and external meridians are disconnected, their interchanges are disrupted; thus, if illness is internal, the original cavity is not secure, and sweat emerges from the organs; if the illness is on the surface, then the pores are not firm, and sweat escapes from the meridians. Therefore, the causes of sweating are numerous. As for the yin of the organs blocking the defensive qi and dispersing outward without support, it may be due to weak stomach qi causing dispersion of food essence or weak lung qi unable to circulate nourishment and defense, resulting in spontaneous sweating. Such cases, even if severe, still hold potential for treatment, but for those whose three yang are completely exhausted, the sweating cannot be treated."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"**Night Sweating** When the defensive qi moves through the night in the yin, it may encounter the six excesses of nature on the surface, or be affected by the changes in human qi due to the rise and fall of vitality, similar to the five evils and six excesses of the heavens that interact within.

Wind, fire, and heat, which align with yang, can also inflict damage, particularly when the fire of the heart rises from the kidneys and liver along the four meridians, leading to even greater harm. Fire cannot coexist with original qi; thus, when fire is excessive, yang is diminished. The defensive qi and yang are one; therefore, when yang is weak, the defense is also deficient. The deficiency of the defensive qi operates in yin; during sleep, there is even less qi to secure the surface, causing the pores to open and fluids to leak out as sweat. When awake, with the eyes open, the yin qi re-disperses to the surface, and the sweating ceases. This condition is called night sweating, specifically the perspiration that occurs during sleep. The \"Inner Canon\" states that those with kidney ailments may experience abdominal swelling, limb edema, wheezing, coughing, and sweating during sleep.

Additionally, in the case of the three yang diseases combined, if the eyes connect, there will be sweating. Cheng Wujing commented that cold-induced night sweats are not merely due to yang deficiency as in other mixed diseases, but are caused by the evil residing between the exterior and interior. Why? If the evil Qi resides entirely on the exterior, affecting the defensive Qi, then spontaneous sweating occurs. However, if the evil Qi invades the interior and connects to the exterior, then when one sleeps, the defensive Qi moves into the interior, sustaining the interior Yang Qi, leading to the leakage of fluids and resulting in night sweats. This is not solely a result of deficiency, but must also be a result of some level of fullness, and regarding night sweats, it should still be considered an exterior condition. Observing Zhang Zhongjing's two discussions may seem different, but upon close examination of their subtleties, they can be seen as one and the same. Why is this? The \"Inner Canon\" discusses the source, stating that the heart and kidneys are the masters of Yin and Yang, thus sweating must arise from the Yang of the heart, and sleeping must arise from the Yin of the kidneys.

This is aligned with the outer defensive Qi. Wang's commentary connects the defensive Qi with the Yang Qi of heaven and earth. While the interpretation by Zhang Zhongjing of achieving non-self is indeed commendable, it is not entirely appropriate. For those suffering from miscellaneous ailments, can one blame solely the deficiency of Yang without considering the deficiency of Yin? I have observed that in cases of sweating during various illnesses, there are instances of both cold and hot sweat—there must be a reason for this. When heat evil invades the Yin deficiency, the resulting sweat is bound to be hot; meanwhile, when cold evil invades the Yang deficiency, the resulting sweat is bound to be cold.

According to Cheng Wuji in the “Essentials of the Golden Cabinet,” it is said that people with weak and thin pulses are prone to spontaneous sweating. Additionally, Chao’s “Sources of Illness” states that spontaneous sweating in those with chronic weakness is caused by Yang deficiency, thus implying that all instances of spontaneous sweating stem from a lack of Yang. However, if we refer back to the “Essentials of the Golden Cabinet,” a weak pulse indicates a deficiency in Yang qi, while a thin pulse indicates a deficiency in Yin qi. Why is it that only Yang is emphasized while Yin is neglected? This is a significant oversight of the learned. Moreover, the illness of chronic weakness can arise in several ways: from a major illness where Yin qi hasn’t recovered and residual heat lingers; from labor or the desires tied to the seven emotions, which deplete Yin essence; or from foods and medicines that generate internal heat, all of which can harm Yin blood and exhaust the body’s energy. When Yin qi is deficient, it cannot support Yang, hence Yang qi evaporates internally, leading to persistent excessive sweating—this allows the Yang to survive without dispersing.

Spontaneous sweating occurs continuously without a specific time and increases with movement. Night sweats happen when the body sweats profusely during sleep and gradually subsides upon waking. Ancient texts suggest that spontaneous sweating is related to yang deficiency, where the protective layer is not secure. The body's protective energy (wei qi) should solidify the surface; if it is not secure, the surface weakens, leading to spontaneous sweating as fluids are expelled. The treatment should focus on strengthening the surface and supplementing yang. On the other hand, night sweats are associated with yin deficiency. When yin is deficient, yang must compensate, which causes the yang to steam the yin components, leading to heat in the blood. When the blood is hot, fluids leak out as night sweats, thus the treatment should clear heat and replenish yin. This is the fundamental principle that should not be overlooked. However, from my observations, spontaneous sweating can also arise from yin deficiency, and night sweats may often indicate yang deficiency. For instance, when one experiences excessive heat or fatigue, spontaneous sweating is most common. Factors such as the heat generated from food in the stomach, fatigue-related heat from the spleen, and heat from alcohol and sexual activities can all cause spontaneous sweating. In such cases, can this be anything but a sign of excessive yang and declining yin? Additionally, a person's sleep and wakefulness are influenced by the flow of protective energy, which is yang energy. During sleep, this energy enters the yin aspects; hence, this is a time when the surface is not yang-deficient. Therefore, both spontaneous sweating and night sweats each have signs of yin and yang, and one cannot simply conclude that spontaneous sweating is always a result of yang deficiency, nor that night sweats are always due to yin deficiency. So, how do we discern the differences in yin and yang? The answer lies in observing the presence or absence of heat; whether it is yin or yang can be discerned this way. If sweating occurs due to excessive heat, it indicates that heat is consuming the yin, making yin deficiency evident."},{"anchor":"trans-46p","marker":"46p","type":"translation","text":"Those who sweat without heat show that their qi is not stable, and their yang is deficient; this is evident.

The classics say: the sweat of yang is named after the rain of heaven and earth; its meaning is understandable. However, sweat emerges from yin and is discharged through yang. Its root is the ying qi from within yin, while its opening and closing are governed by the wei qi of yang. Therefore, anyone wishing to promote sweating without understanding the rise and fall of ying and wei, or intending to prevent sweating without knowing the male and female aspects of the locking key, is akin to rowing a boat on land and driving a cart on the sea; I know they are bound to fail.

In severe cases, such as after illness, childbirth, or significant vomiting, diarrhea, or blood loss, sweating often occurs—this is indeed a result of qi departing. Hence, the classics state: when yin prevails, the body becomes cold and sweaty, the body remains clear yet feels chilly, often shivering and resulting in cold extremities, which can lead to fullness in the abdomen and death. Zhongjing said: extreme cold can provoke sweating, and the body will be as cold as ice; this is all referred to as yin sweat. Thus, in treating yin sweat, one should simply observe the degree of qi deficiency.

Once sweat has ceased but there remains some vital energy, it indicates a critical condition."},{"anchor":"trans-55p","marker":"55p","type":"translation","text":"If sweating arises and one uses medicine to stop the sweat, then the sweating cannot be stopped. If sweating is excessive and one uses blood-tonifying medicine, then blood will not quickly regenerate. The urgent matter is to replenish the qi, which can still be restored. However, among qi-tonifying medicines, ginseng truly cannot be substituted for anything else. One should use the Sweat-Collecting and Yang-Replenishing Decoction, which includes one tael each of ginseng, astragalus, ophiopogon, and cooked rehmannia, three qian of north five-flavor fruit, five qian each of angelica and roasted jujube seed, and one qian of licorice, boiled in water to take. After one dose, the sweating will cease; after two doses, the qi will be restored; after three doses, the qi will be vigorous; after four doses, the body will be healthy. The essence of this formula lies in the balanced replenishment of qi and blood, especially focusing on qi, which provides enough energy to generate yang. When yang is abundant, yin will also be produced. In cases of yang deficiency, although yang is lost, in fact, it is due to yin deficiency that cannot contain yang, resulting in the loss of yang qi. If yin were sufficient to contain yang, then even if sweating occurs, there would be no loss of yang. However, in treating yang deficiency, how can one only seek to restore yang? One must restore both yang and yin. Profuse sweating necessitates the use of qi-tonifying medicine to rescue the condition of yang deficiency. However, if qi-tonifying medicine is overused, there is still a fear that yang will become exuberant while yin dissipates. After taking several doses of qi-tonifying medicine, it is advisable to shift to tonifying yin products. Moreover, after the loss of yang, yin and blood are indeed depleted, so providing water-tonifying medicine corresponds perfectly to this situation. When yin is stabilized, yang will flourish, eliminating the issue of one side being overly dominant."},{"anchor":"trans-56p","marker":"56p","type":"translation","text":"**Head Sweating** When a person's head sweats, it is due to an excess of kidney fire and a deficiency of kidney water. If one does not understand the reason and merely uses sweat-stopping medicines, it will surely lead to dizziness and ear pain. The method should be to nourish the kidneys and clear the source of lung transformation, which will naturally be effective. The prescription includes one pound of mulberry leaves, two pounds of cooked rehmannia, three taels of north five-flavor herb, and six taels of ophiopogon, all ground into powder, then formed into pills with honey. Take five qian or one liang daily with hot water, and after a month, sweating will cease forever. Additionally, if there is excessive head sweating during meals, it is due to excess stomach fire rather than residual kidney fire. The method here should incorporate one pound each of scrophularia, ophiopogon, tian dong, and raw rehmannia, four taels of north five-flavor herb, and half a pound of sour jujube seed, all ground into powder and formed into pills with honey.

It is because the stomach fire is only slightly elevated, not intensely raging and fiery, merely because of the flavors from food entering the stomach, leading to slight perspiration. Once the meal is finished, the sweating also ceases. Therefore, resolving it with just a single ingredient like Scrophularia is sufficient. Furthermore, using ingredients like Tianma, two types of Dong, to clear lung fire, and Shengdi to cool the blood, as well as Suanzaoren to calm heart fire and Wuweizi to control sweating and nourish fluids, will also diminish the stomach's fiery state, especially since it was not excessively strong to begin with. This is one method of moderation. The sweat from the hands is a minor issue, and there's no need to involve this treatment; washing them with water would suffice. For the hand sweating, one would use one ounce each of Astragalus and Kudzu, and three qian each of Schizonepeta and Ledebouriella, boiling them in water to prepare a basin of decoction, then steaming and washing the hands three times while warm, which will eliminate the sweat—a marvelous remedy.

There is no need to use the method of guiding water under the navel if there is no loss of essence.

Poor diet and excessive labor due to official matters resulted in an illness that led to prolonged sweating. After recovery, he continued to sweat without stopping for several days and felt severe chills, demanding thicker clothing. He experienced tightness in the chest, restlessness, intermittent fever, dizziness, and food reduction. This was due to excessive external Yin fire from the stomach, compounded by moist heat from the rain, which intensified the accumulation of moist heat, resulting in persistent sweating. Furthermore, a wind pathogen coupled with the elements of the eastern auspicious direction contributed to his condition. Wind herbs were used to alleviate dryness, and sweet herbs were used to purge heat. The Qianghuo Shengshi Decoction was the main prescription, and just one dose alleviated all symptoms."},{"anchor":"trans-79p","marker":"79p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Hygiene Treasure\" states: In the 46th year of age, Duke Wu of Zhen Ding, during the third month of the Bingzi year of the Yuan dynasty, fell ill due to worry and overwork, resulting in irregular eating habits. His limbs were cold, and his breath was cool in his mouth and nose. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead, and he often felt dizzy, with his six pulses thin like a spider's thread. One physician diagnosed a wind condition and attempted to treat it with a wind-dispersing powder. I recalled that in Qian's \"Treatise on Children,\" it was mentioned that a child's internal injury to the spleen and stomach could lead to either vomiting or diarrhea, and if prolonged, wind evil could invade the stomach, causing diarrhea and a bound condition. This might lead to lingering surprise, thus the wind-dispersing powder would expel the wind evil. The \"Inner Canon\" states that prolonged wind can cause diarrhea—that is exactly the case. Now, with Duke Wu's physical symptoms, it is a condition of excessive Yin and deficient Yang, and bitter-cold medicines are not appropriate. The \"Inner Canon\" says that excessive Yin leads to profuse sweating and coldness. Moreover, the treatise on the correspondence between Yin and Yang states that when Yin is excessive, the body becomes cold, sweating occurs, the body feels persistently cool, and one experiences chills. Coldness causes dysfunction. The \"Regulation of the Menstrual Cycle\" also states that excessive Yin generates internal cold. Qi Bo said that reverse Qi rises and cold accumulates in the chest without relieving itself; if it does not relieve, warm Qi leaves, and cold remains, thus causing internal cold. Dongyuan explains that this indicates insufficient spleen and stomach energy due to overwork, leading to illness in the middle burner, transmitting cold inward, and thus only yang should be supplemented. Therefore, I prescribed the \"Li Zhong Decoction\" with added black aconite, taking five qian for each dose, and recommended the broth of lamb cooked with scallions, taking one large cup of the clear juice to mix and consume. By evening, his limbs gradually warmed, and he perspired slightly.

This causes their Yang to not be firmly retained, and the season cannot overcome their heat. If even the time and seasons cannot be controlled, how can medicine help? Winter is the month of closure and storage. The Yang energy should lie dormant beneath the nine springs until spring arrives with thunder, stirring everything into movement, which is the way of nurturing life.

Moreover, the Yang energy of the human body should also lie dormant within, not to be recklessly disturbed, nor should the skin be allowed to leak, causing Qi to be rapidly depleted; this is the response to winter storage.

After half a year, if not blood in the stools, then there was night sweating; if not experiencing cold chills, then there was fever. The two treatments of blood and sweat had no effect; the six pulses were floating and large, while the heart and spleen were depleted. This resulted from overthinking, which harmed the heart and spleen, causing an inability to contain blood and restore it to its source. However, blood is indeed sweat, and sweat is blood; their colors, red and dark, indicate minor or severe fluctuations of fire. Chills and fever indicated a deficiency of both qi and blood. Thus, in the morning, I employed a restorative formula to tonify the middle and augment qi, aiming to strengthen the source of the spleen and lungs and lift the sinking qi; in the afternoon, I used Gui Pi (Return the Spleen) with black and five flavors, to nourish the blood of the heart and spleen, consolidating the dispersed fluids. Within two months, all symptoms completely resolved. Xia Bao Gu Ren, aged sixty-one, after suffering from dysentery, experienced involuntary semen leakage for two days before it ceased.

Using two doses of tonifying medicine further aggravated the condition; his pulse was floating, large, and rapid, but when examined, it was weak and thin.

I administered Liuwei Huayang Decoction with one tael of ginseng and three qian each of ginger and aconite, making him take it as a brew. After a brief time, he broke out in sweat, as if bathed. By noon, he was drenched in sweat and could hardly recover, feeling cold as if he were dead, with almost no breath. I was informed of this again. I commanded that the previous medicine be brewed again for him, but the messenger said: \"He has already sweated profusely from this medicine; can he endure more sweating with another dose?\" I laughed and said: \"There is a principle in this that you do not understand.\" I insisted on administering it again, and this led to the cessation of sweating and the recovery of his spirit.
