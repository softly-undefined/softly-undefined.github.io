<pre><code>        Yellow Emperor&#39;s Plain Questions<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Qi of the Foot Shaoyang meridian emerges three inches under the armpit, extending to the side beneath the ribs; there are eight points in total, one at each interval. [Note: The area beneath the armpit refers to the points Yuan-Ye, Zhe-Jin, and Tian-Chi. The area below the ribs to the waist includes the points Ri-Yue, Zhang-Men, Dai-Mai, Wu-Shu, Wei-Dao, Ju-Liao, totaling nine points. The &quot;eight intervals&quot; refer to the distance from three inches below the armpit to the space between the twelfth ribs, encompassing eight ribs.] The Qi of the Hand Taiyang meridian emerges from each of the two points above the elbow. [Note: This refers to the points Nao-Yu and those near the shoulder; they are located under the large bone, in the depression above the scapula, and can be accessed by raising the arm.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essential Principles of True Understanding</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyang controls the heavens; when cold influences prevail, the cold Qi returns, causing fiery heat to operate fiercely. The people suffer from fullness in the chest and abdomen, hot hands, elbow contractions, and swelling in the armpit. The root of the illness lies in the heart, where the Shenmen is obstructed, leading to death without treatment. [Note: Taiyang is the chief among all Yang energies, representing the Yang of the Fire Emperor, yet is fundamentally influenced by the cold water below. When cold Qi ascends, the entire body becomes cold, with Taiyang operating in the middle; hence, it is said the fiery heat operates fiercely. When cold oppresses from above, the Yang can overcome it, which is why general afflictions from cold manifest as heat diseases. Symptoms such as fullness in the chest and abdomen, hot hands, elbow contractions, and swollen armpits indicate cold obstructing the heart&#39;s fire, forcing the heat to rise and creating conflict between water and fire, leading to the obstruction of the Shenmen pulse and extinguishing heart Qi. The Shenmen is the specific point indicating the heart, located where the radial artery is palpable on the back of the palm. Observing the pulse&#39;s movement provides insight into the existence of the five organ systems.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on the Basics</strong></p>
<p>The axillary artery is associated with the Hand Taiyin, known as Tianfu (Heavenly Mansion). Three inches below the armpit, in the palm, is called Tianchi (Heavenly Pool).</p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The meridian of the Lung, Hand Taiyin, begins in the Central Jiao, connects with the lungs, and horizontally emerges from the armpit. </p>
<p>The meridian of the Heart, Hand Shaoyin, begins in the heart; its main pathway ascends from the heart to the lungs and exits from the armpit. The meridian of the Heart in the Hand Jueyin encircles the heart, originating from the chest; its branch travels through the chest and emerges three inches below the armpit, extending up to the armpit. This causes conditions such as heat in the heart when it is active, tension in the elbow, and swelling in the axilla; in severe cases, there will be fullness in the chest and ribs, with notable agitation in the heart. </p>
<p>(Note: Jueyin indicates that when active, it can lead to heart heat, elbow tension, and axillary swelling; these are symptoms of meridian perturbation externally. In severe cases, the fullness radiates from the exterior to the interior, indicating an excess within.) </p>
<p>The meridian of the Gallbladder, Foot Shaoyang, has its main pathway running from the supraclavicular fossa down to the axilla.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Classical Chinese Text Translation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Separate Treatise on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Yangming meridian travels through the solar plexus, enters the armpit, and connects to the small intestine.</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Tendons and Muscles</strong></p>
<p>The foot&#39;s Yangming tendon begins at the little toe, with branches running along the outer edge of the armpit, connecting to the shoulder joint; another branch enters the armpit and ascends to the supraclavicular fossa. Its pathology includes an inability to lift the shoulder, pain at the junction of the armpit and supraclavicular fossa, and restriction in lateral movement. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The inability to lift the shoulder, alongside pain in the junction at the supraclavicular fossa, indicates a tendon issue.</p>
<p>The foot&#39;s Shaoyang tendon surpasses the little and adjacent toes, and straightly ascends from the armpit, passing through the supraclavicular fossa and anterior to the solar plexus. </p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Yangming tendon begins above the little finger, follows along the inner arm, enters the armpit, and if there is pain in the armpit and along the back edge, it leads to pain around the shoulder blade and neck. Its associated conditions relate to any area it traverses, causing pain, swelling, or weakness in the tendons. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The hand&#39;s Yangming tendon originates from the lesser marsh point on the little finger, traversing the arm, elbow, shoulder, and neck, ultimately connecting between the ear, jaw, and inner canthus of the eye. Issues at any site that it passes through lead to pain, swelling, or atrophy of the tendons.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Taiyin tendon begins above the thumb, follows the inner arm, enters the armpit, and exits at the supraclavicular fossa, binding at the front of the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s heart meridian tendon begins at the middle finger, follows the inner arm, and binds in the armpit, with branches entering the armpit and dispersing in the chest. </p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Shaoyin tendon starts on the inner side of the little finger, enters the armpit, and intersects with the Taiyin meridian.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Bone Measurements Section</strong></p>
<p>From the angle to the column bone, the length is one foot; from the armpit not visible, the length is four inches; from the armpit to the lower side of the ribs, the length is one foot two inches. </p>
<p>[Note: The bone at the top of the shoulder blade is referred to as the column bone, while the area beneath the ribs is the armpit. The measurement from the column bone to the armpit is four inches. Below the ribs is the lower side of the ribs. The measurement from the armpit to the lower side of the ribs is one foot two inches.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Yingqi Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Yingqi emerges from the Taiyin, entering the Hand Yangming, it ascends and enters the Foot Yangming, then descends to the top of the foot, entering between the big toes, and joining with Taiyin. It ascends to the thigh, from the thigh entering the heart, circulating through the Hand Shaoyin, exiting from the armpit and arm, then entering the little finger, joining with Hand Taiyang. It ascends through the armpit, exiting inside, and also circulating through the heart control vessel, exiting from the armpit and arm.</p>
<p><strong>Yingwei Shenghui Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The upper jiao emerges from the stomach’s upper orifice, above the throat, penetrating the diaphragm and spreading within the chest, moving towards the armpit.</p>
<p><strong>Cold and Heat Diseases Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The axillary artery is the Hand Taiyin, named Tianfu.<br>[Note: The axillary artery is part of the Hand Taiyin, which governs the yin and yang qi.]</p>
<p><strong>Ben Zang Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The area that combines with the armpit to expand the ribs is below the lungs.<br>[Note: The lungs are situated above the ribs and armpits.]</p>
<p><strong>Wei Qi Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The origin of Hand Taiyin is located within the inch pulse, marked by the movement inside the armpit. The origin of the palm&#39;s heart is found between the two tendons behind the palm, two inches in, marked beneath the armpit, three inches below.</p>
<p><strong>Yin and Yang Twenty-five People Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Below Hand Yangming, when the blood and qi are abundant, the hair under the armpit is fine and beautiful, and the hand warms with flesh.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p>
<h3>The Evil Guest Treatise</h3>
<p>There are deep valleys in the earth, and armpits in people; those who resonate with heaven and earth are like this. The channel of the Taiyin hand ascends along the inner thigh, enters the armpit, bends inward, and connects to the lungs. If the liver has an evil, its qi flows to both armpits.</p>
<p><strong>Qianjin Fang</strong> (Tang, Sun Simiao)</p>
<h3>Fox Odor Leakage</h3>
<p>Some are born with a fox odor, while others acquire it from others. The naturally occurring odor is difficult to treat, while the acquired one is easier to cure. However, one must apply vinegar and alum powder continuously for three years without stopping, and also take Five Spice Pills to achieve recovery. Do not assume that a single application of medicine will result in a cure; rather, a temporary relief occurs after each application. Those with fox odor should avoid eating rapeseed, five pungent herbs, as consuming them will prevent healing for life.</p>
<p><strong>Wound Diseases Compendium</strong> (Jin, Dou Hanqing)</p>
<h3>Left and Right Carbuncles</h3>
<p>The left armpit carbuncle develops under the left armpit near the breast area, arising from unstable emotions or sudden fright from food or drink, or due to suppressing anger. If not treated quickly, it will surely become chronic. Urgently take Qianjin Neituo Powder, Quan Poison Flow Qi Drink, and Yellow Alum Pill; externally apply surrounding medicine, using Tie Guo Powder or Jin Guo Powder for treatment.</p>
<p>The right armpit carbuncle develops between the blood hall; it initially appears as a small lump that gradually enlarges into a carbuncle. Urgently take three to five applications of Neituo Powder; also apply surrounding medicine and take Yellow Alum Pills, followed by three to five doses of Shiqi Powder, before finally using a needle to puncture it. The treatment method is the same as above.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case Records</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji】</p>
<p><strong>(Nóu qí) Abscess</strong></p>
<p>An abscess located on the soft flesh beside the neck, armpits, and near both breasts is referred to as (Nóu qí) abscess. This is a cold condition without heat; it is advisable to use internal supplements like &quot;Ten Dispersions&quot; and &quot;Returning Yang Jade Dragon Ointment.&quot; For young children, care must be taken not to use Aconite lightly, as it may cause convulsions. Avoid needling and incisions, as there will be thin blood without pus, and the flesh is difficult to heal. Warm, heating medications should be applied to disperse internally. If needling or cutting has been performed, leading to the formation of flesh, this medicine should be used to consolidate the condition. If the medicine causes slight pain or mild convulsions, it is advisable to use the &quot;Whole Scorpion Guanyin Powder,&quot; adjusting as necessary, and once the convulsions settle, continue with the original medication. Additionally, if a child suffers from phlegm retention, with abscesses manifesting in areas like the neck, arms, chest, or back, this indicates severe cold, and treatment must focus on the effectiveness of hot medicinal applications.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Tradition</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu】</p>
<p><strong>Body Odor</strong></p>
<p>The armpit relates to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian; when liver qi becomes stagnant internally, it manifests outwardly, producing an odor akin to that of a fox, hence termed &quot;Fox Odor.&quot; There are openings under the armpit; when liver qi is excessive, these openings widen, allowing the qi to leak out, making it difficult to approach. This is fundamentally due to the evil qi of the liver meridian. Rubbing externally with alum or musk can only provide temporary relief; the odor will return before the day is out. Why is this? It stems from an ignorance of treating the root cause. What is the root treatment? It involves dispelling the invasive qi from the liver internally, allowing the qi to settle naturally, with remedies such as &quot;Liver-Dissolving Decoction&quot; or &quot;Dragon-Gathering Pill&quot; serving this purpose.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Axillary Leak</strong></p>
<p>The area under both armpits and the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, genital region, and scrotum often feels like it is moist and stains clothing, a condition referred to as axillary leak, for which the Six Substance Decoction is indicated.<br><strong>Criterion for Symptom and Treatment</strong>  【Ming - Wang Kengtang】</p>
<p><strong>Related Parts</strong></p>
<p>The axilla refers to the area under the arms, associated with the Hand Jueyin Pericardium channel. Danxi states that when the Yin and Yang of the hands and feet manifest, it is called axillary swelling, indicating the Hand Jueyin and Foot Shaoyang. Additionally, it is linked to the Foot Jueyin Liver channel. The Ling Shu states: when the liver has evils, its qi lingers in both armpits. The anterior axilla pertains to the Hand Taiyin Lung channel, the posterior axilla to the Shaoyin Heart channel, and under the armpits to the Foot Jueyin Liver channel, six inches below belongs to the great network of the Foot Taiyin Spleen.</p>
<p><strong>(Nèiqí) Nodule Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks about nodules beside the neck and armpits, or lumps occurring in the soft flesh of the groin, it is referred to as (Nèiqí) nodule abscess, relating to the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao channel. Its onset is gradual, indicating a cold pattern, not a heat pattern. It is appropriate to use the Resuscitating Yang Jade Dragon Ointment, applying hot medicine externally, and taking internal remedies like the Shí Xuān San, He Shou Wu San, or selected Sheng Jin Dan.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Armpit Sores</strong></p>
<p>The text states: &quot;Inner guilt sores appear in both armpits and arms as well as in the palms of the hands, accompanied by chilling blood, heat, dry throat; excessive drinking leads to vomiting, and there is a restless, troubled heart. The pulse is strong. If diagnosed like this for six, seven, or eight days, there is sweating; without sweating, it can be fatal.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Interarm Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When asked about an abscess developing in the space under the shoulder, the response is: &quot;This is called interarm abscess, related to the hand&#39;s lesser yin heart and the hand&#39;s jueyin pericardium due to wind-heat. One should take an internal decoction of astragalus and notopterygium. For the robust, use the Eight-Essential Powder or a single Golden Elixir, and select from the Purple Gold Elixir or the Victory Gold Elixir. For the elderly and weak, use astragalus, costus, ginseng nourishing elixir, or the Complete Ten Vitalizing Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Classics [Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Armpit Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Commonly known as interabscess, this condition involves the liver and spleen channels. There is blood stagnation in the liver channel and qi stagnation in the spleen channel, leading to swelling. Initially, the skin color does not change, with diffuse swelling without a head, and after some time, pain arises, presenting cold and heat symptoms. This condition is difficult to dissipate and ultimately will produce pus. If not ruptured, use the chi hu clearing liver decoction. Once ruptured, use the Complete Ten Vitalizing Decoction, omitting cinnamon and adding cyperus and aged tangerine peel. For soft, swollen, and painful growths, apply a needle and adhesive dressing. However, this condition requires warm supplementation at both ends, and the use of cold or cooling substances should be avoided.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shaan Zhuo Kui Jian Decoction</strong><br>This treats carbuncles and abscesses arising from the Shaoyang meridian in the hands and feet, as well as swelling and toxic lumps, including the initial hard formations like stone that do not rupture; this may also manifest along the Yangming meridian of the foot; or in cases where it has already burst and is leaking pus. Treatment applies to all these symptoms. The dosage depends on the specific condition, considering the patient&#39;s diet and stool consistency, to adjust as needed.</p>

The patient should lie down with their feet elevated and head lowered, taking one mouthful at a time, swallowing ten times until the dose is complete, then they should rest as usual to let the medicine settle in the chest. Prepare an additional half dosage into a fine powder, making honey pills the size of soybeans, taking 100 pills per dose, and retaining a mouthful of soup to wash it down. For tubercular conditions, add half a liang of seaweed, stir-fried, adjusting the amount based on the patient&#39;s condition. All dosages should follow this principle.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Lime Powder</p>

Grind into a fine powder, create a strong decoction using soapwort, and apply on both armpits. At night, wash with soapwort decoction to clean, then apply the medicine until fully absorbed. Additionally, brew one tael of licorice for internal consumption; externally use four qian of Euphorbia powder mixed with lard to rub under the armpits for a day and night to expel internal odor; then use one tael of alum, five qian of clam powder, and one qian of camphor as a final application to eliminate the root of the ailment.</p>
<p><strong>Liubai Powder</strong><br>To treat leakage under the armpits and moist palms, feet, and groin, which often dampen clothes. Dried goji root, dried rose root, and fresh licorice, each two taels; lychee powder, shanglu root, and talcum, each one tael. Grind into powder and mix with a little bitter wine for application.

Apply it thoroughly under both armpits. Before noon, take the clothes you’ve worn, cut off the sleeves, wash them clean with lye, and soak to remove the odor from the sleeves. Only then can you wear them as they should be like new clothes. If you wash them and the smell does not go away, it is futile to use the medicine. Generally, the medicines are effective, but often the clothes still retain the odor, which prevents complete removal.</p>
<p>Another formula: four fen each of magnolia flower, asarum, ligusticum, and green wood fragrance, treat and sift them together, then incense and grind them into powder.</p>
<p>Another method: at dawn, take two large pieces of prime pork and mix with one tael of sweet tea (Gansui) powder, place it under the armpits until dawn. Then, take one tael of licorice, boil it in water and drink. You will soon have a strong purge; this should be done away from populated areas to avoid spreading foul odors.

Use this liquid to apply under the armpits, eliminating the odor completely.</p>
<p>Another method: First, apply rouge to the armpits. When the area emitting the odor turns yellow, take the prepared snail without the shell and place it over the smelly area. Secure it tightly with silk cloth, allowing the odor to be expelled through the bowels, thereby eliminating it.</p>
<p>Root removal method for underarm odor: First, shave off body hair and cleanse the area. Mix white powder with water to apply to the affected area. After six to seven days, observe if a small dark spot appears, about the size of a needle hole or a pin tip; this indicates that the odor is being expelled. Use a pen to mark it, and then take small moxa sticks about the size of a grain of rice and burn seven pieces at that spot. If after moxibustion there is a heart pain, apply another remedy consisting of three fen of Qingmu Xiang and three fen of cloves, eight fen of betel nut, one qian of sandalwood, a little musk, and three qian of rhubarb, boiled in water to drink. If no effect is seen, take an additional two qian of rhubarb and repeat.</p>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: For axillary abscess with great heat, puncture the foot&#39;s lesser yang at the fifth point; if the heat does not cease, puncture the hand&#39;s heart channel at the main point; also puncture the hand&#39;s greater yin channels at the various large joint points, three times each. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: An abscess develops in the axilla, if red and firm, it is called rice sore; treat it with stone needles, wishing for fine and long needles; use a rough needle and apply pig fat. After six days, do not cover it. If the abscess is firm and does not rupture, it is a horse knife wrapped around a goiter, needing urgent treatment. The &quot;Yao Yi Gang Mu&quot; states: In the &quot;Nei Jing,&quot; there are two methods for treating axillary swellings: the first is to address the gallbladder. The classic states: illnesses arising from the gallbladder&#39;s lesser yang channel show swelling and pain in the axillary region, which is the case. The second is to address the heart. The classic states: the heart governs the hand&#39;s jueyin channel, which, if active, results in heat of the palm and axillary swelling; one must assess the conditions of deficiency, excess, cold, and heat to determine treatment, applying moxibustion as needed.</p>
<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Ben Cao Gang Mu&quot; states: An elderly woman in a certain district developed a lump in her right axilla, which gradually grew to about a foot in size and eventually ulcerated. A folk practitioner advised her to use a long-handled medicinal gourd, burned and ground to a powder, to apply to the area, which ultimately led to the abscess draining completely and healing.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The &quot;Xuè Family Medical Cases&quot; states: Zhu Wending&#39;s mother developed a lump under her armpit due to resentment, which lasted for over twenty years. When she became angry, it swelled and became painful, with food not digesting and a lack of appetite. Dong Yuan said that continuous diarrhea and inability to consume food indicate a deficiency in the intestines and stomach. Therefore, a modified Six Gentlemen Decoction was prescribed, adding cardamom, cinnamon, dried ginger, and nutmeg. Although the diarrhea stopped, the pus remained clear, and the sore did not heal, indicating a deficiency in both qi and blood. After a month of using the Shenqi Decoction, she recovered.</p>
<p>In Henan, Zhang Chengzu, over twenty years old, had a hard swelling under his armpit, not rupturing for over ten days. His pulse was weak, and he occasionally vomited. I suggested that the hard swelling not rupturing with a weak pulse indicated a deficiency of yang qi, while the vomiting and lack of appetite indicated weak stomach qi. I initially treated him with a Six Gentlemen Decoction plus patchouli and cardamom. He argued that the vomiting during swelling should be treated as a toxic energy attacking the heart, while if it were a rupture, it should be treated as a deficiency of yin. I replied that this was merely a broad statement by Danxi. Indeed, all painful and itchy sores belong to heart fire. If the swelling is red and painful, with agitation, a strong pulse and vomiting indicate excess, thus requiring purging. If the swelling is hard and does not rupture, the weak pulse and vomiting indicate deficiency, thus requiring tonification. It is also possible for pain to damage stomach qi, or for one to experience vomiting due to cold or turbid qi; even if there are swellings or sores, strengthening the stomach and enhancing qi is still warranted. He insisted on his viewpoint and took aggressive medicine, worsening his condition. Upon further consultation, his pulse was weak yet slightly febrile. I noted that heat with a quiet pulse, blood loss with a strong pulse, and post-sweat agitation all indicate that treatment is not advisable. Ultimately, he died. </p>
<p>In conclusion, vomiting due to internal toxic energy invading from swellings occurs in about 10-20% of cases; while vomiting from moisture invading ruptures is more common, occurring in about 80-90%. How can these be treated as one and the same?<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>A man had a toxic condition under his armpit, experiencing severe cough, loss of appetite, intestinal pain, cold limbs, and a thin pulse. After administering two doses of the Tori Warming Middle Decoction, he quickly recovered. Further treatment with the Fragrant Sand Six Gentlemen Decoction and Er Shen Pill led to a prompt improvement in his diet, followed by more than ten doses of the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction, which stabilized his condition.</p>
<p>A boy had an ulcer under his armpit that would not heal, with clear pus, a strong pulse, fatigue, reluctance to eat, little sleep, spontaneous sweating, and dry mouth. He was treated with the Internal Supplement Huangqi Decoction and moxibustion with fermented soybeans, and he recovered after two months. In cases of ulcers that have ruptured and drained clear pus, or where the ulcer edges do not come together, or where swelling is not red, with cold muscles and limbs, or with pale sweating, the condition indicates deficiency of both qi and blood, which requires tonification.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A man over fifty years old had a toxic ulcer under his armpit, with the ulcer not closing, a rapid pulse, and thirst, indicating stomach fire. He was treated with Bamboo Leaf Huangqi Decoction, which alleviated the symptoms, followed by qi-tonifying herbs for recovery. I have often treated thirst or fever occurring in the afternoon with Earth Bone Bark Powder.</p>
<p>Zhang Tong, a man from the North, over forty years old, developed a toxic condition under his armpit in the summer. After it ruptured, it would not heal, with clear, thin pus, cold skin, and a weak pulse, along with intestinal pain, loose stools, and vomiting after eating, indicating a cold transformation that had penetrated inward. A powerful warming and spicy remedy was indicated. Therefore, he was given two applications of the Tori Warming Middle Decoction, and all symptoms subsided. He then received several doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction with roasted dried ginger and cinnamon, followed by the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Qi of the Foot Shaoyang meridian emerges three inches under the armpit, extending to the side beneath the ribs; there are eight points in total, one at each interval. [Note: The area beneath the armpit refers to the points Yuan-Ye, Zhe-Jin, and Tian-Chi. The area below the ribs to the waist includes the points Ri-Yue, Zhang-Men, Dai-Mai, Wu-Shu, Wei-Dao, Ju-Liao, totaling nine points. The &quot;eight intervals&quot; refer to the distance from three inches below the armpit to the space between the twelfth ribs, encompassing eight ribs.] The Qi of the Hand Taiyang meridian emerges from each of the two points above the elbow. [Note: This refers to the points Nao-Yu and those near the shoulder; they are located under the large bone, in the depression above the scapula, and can be accessed by raising the arm.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essential Principles of True Understanding</strong></p>
<p>The Taiyang controls the heavens; when cold influences prevail, the cold Qi returns, causing fiery heat to operate fiercely. The people suffer from fullness in the chest and abdomen, hot hands, elbow contractions, and swelling in the armpit. The root of the illness lies in the heart, where the Shenmen is obstructed, leading to death without treatment. [Note: Taiyang is the chief among all Yang energies, representing the Yang of the Fire Emperor, yet is fundamentally influenced by the cold water below. When cold Qi ascends, the entire body becomes cold, with Taiyang operating in the middle; hence, it is said the fiery heat operates fiercely. When cold oppresses from above, the Yang can overcome it, which is why general afflictions from cold manifest as heat diseases. Symptoms such as fullness in the chest and abdomen, hot hands, elbow contractions, and swollen armpits indicate cold obstructing the heart&#39;s fire, forcing the heat to rise and creating conflict between water and fire, leading to the obstruction of the Shenmen pulse and extinguishing heart Qi. The Shenmen is the specific point indicating the heart, located where the radial artery is palpable on the back of the palm. Observing the pulse&#39;s movement provides insight into the existence of the five organ systems.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p>The axillary artery is associated with the Hand Taiyin, known as Tianfu (Heavenly Mansion). Three inches below the armpit, in the palm, is called Tianchi (Heavenly Pool).</p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The meridian of the Lung, Hand Taiyin, begins in the Central Jiao, connects with the lungs, and horizontally emerges from the armpit. </p>
<p>The meridian of the Heart, Hand Shaoyin, begins in the heart; its main pathway ascends from the heart to the lungs and exits from the armpit. The meridian of the Heart in the Hand Jueyin encircles the heart, originating from the chest; its branch travels through the chest and emerges three inches below the armpit, extending up to the armpit. This causes conditions such as heat in the heart when it is active, tension in the elbow, and swelling in the axilla; in severe cases, there will be fullness in the chest and ribs, with notable agitation in the heart. </p>
<p>(Note: Jueyin indicates that when active, it can lead to heart heat, elbow tension, and axillary swelling; these are symptoms of meridian perturbation externally. In severe cases, the fullness radiates from the exterior to the interior, indicating an excess within.) </p>
<p>The meridian of the Gallbladder, Foot Shaoyang, has its main pathway running from the supraclavicular fossa down to the axilla.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Separate Treatise on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Yangming meridian travels through the solar plexus, enters the armpit, and connects to the small intestine.</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Tendons and Muscles</strong></p>
<p>The foot&#39;s Yangming tendon begins at the little toe, with branches running along the outer edge of the armpit, connecting to the shoulder joint; another branch enters the armpit and ascends to the supraclavicular fossa. Its pathology includes an inability to lift the shoulder, pain at the junction of the armpit and supraclavicular fossa, and restriction in lateral movement. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The inability to lift the shoulder, alongside pain in the junction at the supraclavicular fossa, indicates a tendon issue.</p>
<p>The foot&#39;s Shaoyang tendon surpasses the little and adjacent toes, and straightly ascends from the armpit, passing through the supraclavicular fossa and anterior to the solar plexus. </p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Yangming tendon begins above the little finger, follows along the inner arm, enters the armpit, and if there is pain in the armpit and along the back edge, it leads to pain around the shoulder blade and neck. Its associated conditions relate to any area it traverses, causing pain, swelling, or weakness in the tendons. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The hand&#39;s Yangming tendon originates from the lesser marsh point on the little finger, traversing the arm, elbow, shoulder, and neck, ultimately connecting between the ear, jaw, and inner canthus of the eye. Issues at any site that it passes through lead to pain, swelling, or atrophy of the tendons.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Taiyin tendon begins above the thumb, follows the inner arm, enters the armpit, and exits at the supraclavicular fossa, binding at the front of the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s heart meridian tendon begins at the middle finger, follows the inner arm, and binds in the armpit, with branches entering the armpit and dispersing in the chest. </p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Shaoyin tendon starts on the inner side of the little finger, enters the armpit, and intersects with the Taiyin meridian.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Evil Guest Treatise</h3>
<p>There are deep valleys in the earth, and armpits in people; those who resonate with heaven and earth are like this. The channel of the Taiyin hand ascends along the inner thigh, enters the armpit, bends inward, and connects to the lungs. If the liver has an evil, its qi flows to both armpits.</p>

<h3>Fox Odor Leakage</h3>
<p>Some are born with a fox odor, while others acquire it from others. The naturally occurring odor is difficult to treat, while the acquired one is easier to cure. However, one must apply vinegar and alum powder continuously for three years without stopping, and also take Five Spice Pills to achieve recovery. Do not assume that a single application of medicine will result in a cure; rather, a temporary relief occurs after each application. Those with fox odor should avoid eating rapeseed, five pungent herbs, as consuming them will prevent healing for life.</p>
<p><strong>Wound Diseases Compendium</strong> (Jin, Dou Hanqing)</p>
<h3>Left and Right Carbuncles</h3>
<p>The left armpit carbuncle develops under the left armpit near the breast area, arising from unstable emotions or sudden fright from food or drink, or due to suppressing anger. If not treated quickly, it will surely become chronic. Urgently take Qianjin Neituo Powder, Quan Poison Flow Qi Drink, and Yellow Alum Pill; externally apply surrounding medicine, using Tie Guo Powder or Jin Guo Powder for treatment.</p>
<p>The right armpit carbuncle develops between the blood hall; it initially appears as a small lump that gradually enlarges into a carbuncle. Urgently take three to five applications of Neituo Powder; also apply surrounding medicine and take Yellow Alum Pills, followed by three to five doses of Shiqi Powder, before finally using a needle to puncture it. The treatment method is the same as above.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case Records</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji】</p>
<p><strong>(Nóu qí) Abscess</strong></p>
<p>An abscess located on the soft flesh beside the neck, armpits, and near both breasts is referred to as (Nóu qí) abscess. This is a cold condition without heat; it is advisable to use internal supplements like &quot;Ten Dispersions&quot; and &quot;Returning Yang Jade Dragon Ointment.&quot; For young children, care must be taken not to use Aconite lightly, as it may cause convulsions. Avoid needling and incisions, as there will be thin blood without pus, and the flesh is difficult to heal. Warm, heating medications should be applied to disperse internally. If needling or cutting has been performed, leading to the formation of flesh, this medicine should be used to consolidate the condition. If the medicine causes slight pain or mild convulsions, it is advisable to use the &quot;Whole Scorpion Guanyin Powder,&quot; adjusting as necessary, and once the convulsions settle, continue with the original medication. Additionally, if a child suffers from phlegm retention, with abscesses manifesting in areas like the neck, arms, chest, or back, this indicates severe cold, and treatment must focus on the effectiveness of hot medicinal applications.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Tradition</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu】</p>
<p><strong>Body Odor</strong></p>
<p>The armpit relates to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian; when liver qi becomes stagnant internally, it manifests outwardly, producing an odor akin to that of a fox, hence termed &quot;Fox Odor.&quot; There are openings under the armpit; when liver qi is excessive, these openings widen, allowing the qi to leak out, making it difficult to approach. This is fundamentally due to the evil qi of the liver meridian. Rubbing externally with alum or musk can only provide temporary relief; the odor will return before the day is out. Why is this? It stems from an ignorance of treating the root cause. What is the root treatment? It involves dispelling the invasive qi from the liver internally, allowing the qi to settle naturally, with remedies such as &quot;Liver-Dissolving Decoction&quot; or &quot;Dragon-Gathering Pill&quot; serving this purpose.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Axillary Leak</strong></p>
<p>The area under both armpits and the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, genital region, and scrotum often feels like it is moist and stains clothing, a condition referred to as axillary leak, for which the Six Substance Decoction is indicated.<br><strong>Criterion for Symptom and Treatment</strong>  【Ming - Wang Kengtang】</p>
<p><strong>Related Parts</strong></p>
<p>The axilla refers to the area under the arms, associated with the Hand Jueyin Pericardium channel. Danxi states that when the Yin and Yang of the hands and feet manifest, it is called axillary swelling, indicating the Hand Jueyin and Foot Shaoyang. Additionally, it is linked to the Foot Jueyin Liver channel. The Ling Shu states: when the liver has evils, its qi lingers in both armpits. The anterior axilla pertains to the Hand Taiyin Lung channel, the posterior axilla to the Shaoyin Heart channel, and under the armpits to the Foot Jueyin Liver channel, six inches below belongs to the great network of the Foot Taiyin Spleen.</p>
<p><strong>(Nèiqí) Nodule Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks about nodules beside the neck and armpits, or lumps occurring in the soft flesh of the groin, it is referred to as (Nèiqí) nodule abscess, relating to the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao channel. Its onset is gradual, indicating a cold pattern, not a heat pattern. It is appropriate to use the Resuscitating Yang Jade Dragon Ointment, applying hot medicine externally, and taking internal remedies like the Shí Xuān San, He Shou Wu San, or selected Sheng Jin Dan.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>The text states: &quot;Inner guilt sores appear in both armpits and arms as well as in the palms of the hands, accompanied by chilling blood, heat, dry throat; excessive drinking leads to vomiting, and there is a restless, troubled heart. The pulse is strong. If diagnosed like this for six, seven, or eight days, there is sweating; without sweating, it can be fatal.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Interarm Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When asked about an abscess developing in the space under the shoulder, the response is: &quot;This is called interarm abscess, related to the hand&#39;s lesser yin heart and the hand&#39;s jueyin pericardium due to wind-heat. One should take an internal decoction of astragalus and notopterygium. For the robust, use the Eight-Essential Powder or a single Golden Elixir, and select from the Purple Gold Elixir or the Victory Gold Elixir. For the elderly and weak, use astragalus, costus, ginseng nourishing elixir, or the Complete Ten Vitalizing Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Classics [Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Armpit Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Commonly known as interabscess, this condition involves the liver and spleen channels. There is blood stagnation in the liver channel and qi stagnation in the spleen channel, leading to swelling. Initially, the skin color does not change, with diffuse swelling without a head, and after some time, pain arises, presenting cold and heat symptoms. This condition is difficult to dissipate and ultimately will produce pus. If not ruptured, use the chi hu clearing liver decoction. Once ruptured, use the Complete Ten Vitalizing Decoction, omitting cinnamon and adding cyperus and aged tangerine peel. For soft, swollen, and painful growths, apply a needle and adhesive dressing. However, this condition requires warm supplementation at both ends, and the use of cold or cooling substances should be avoided.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

Treatment applies to all these symptoms. The dosage depends on the specific condition, considering the patient&#39;s diet and stool consistency, to adjust as needed.</p>
<p>Ingredients:  </p>
<ul>
<li>4 qian of Chai Hu (Bupleurum)  </li>
<li>Stir-fried Long Dan Cao (Gentian) with liquor, rough skin removed  </li>
<li>Zhi Mu (Anemarrhena) soaked in liquor and stir-fried  </li>
<li>(Caoshe) Lou Gen (Pulsatilla) washed with liquor  </li>
<li>Kun Bu (Kelp) washed to remove dirt  </li>
<li>2 liang each of Jie Geng (Platycodon) and Gan Cao (Licorice) roasted  </li>
<li>Jing Sanling (Rhizoma Sparganii) stir-fried with liquor  </li>

<li>6 qian of Sheng Ma (Cimicifuga)  </li>
<li>8 qian of Huang Qin (Scutellaria), half washed and stir-fried, half used raw</li>
</ul>
<p>The above ingredients should be ground and prepared for each dose of 6 or 7 qian. Use 2 shan (an ancient measure) of water, soak for half a day, then boil down to 1 shan, discard the dregs and drink slightly warm. The patient should lie down with their feet elevated and head lowered, taking one mouthful at a time, swallowing ten times until the dose is complete, then they should rest as usual to let the medicine settle in the chest. Prepare an additional half dosage into a fine powder, making honey pills the size of soybeans, taking 100 pills per dose, and retaining a mouthful of soup to wash it down. For tubercular conditions, add half a liang of seaweed, stir-fried, adjusting the amount based on the patient&#39;s condition. All dosages should follow this principle.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat odor under the armpits, it is remarkably effective. Take four taels of Mituo monk, two taels of white alum that has been dried, and three qian of talcum powder. Mix them into a fine powder and apply it to both armpits. You will see results in half a month and be cured in a month.</p>
<p>Another formula: one tael of Mituo monk, seven qian of white alum, and a small amount of calamine and musk. Grind these into a fine powder, first wash with soap pod decoction, and then apply.</p>
<p>Another method: use white alum that has been finely powdered, without restriction on the amount. When going to bed, place paper on the table, extend your hand to support against the wall or column, and use the powder to rub until the underarms feel very hot and painful. Apply it thoroughly under both armpits. Before noon, take the clothes you’ve worn, cut off the sleeves, wash them clean with lye, and soak to remove the odor from the sleeves. Only then can you wear them as they should be like new clothes. If you wash them and the smell does not go away, it is futile to use the medicine. Generally, the medicines are effective, but often the clothes still retain the odor, which prevents complete removal.</p>
<p>Another formula: four fen each of magnolia flower, asarum, ligusticum, and green wood fragrance, treat and sift them together, then incense and grind them into powder.</p>
<p>Another method: at dawn, take two large pieces of prime pork and mix with one tael of sweet tea (Gansui) powder, place it under the armpits until dawn. Then, take one tael of licorice, boil it in water and drink. You will soon have a strong purge; this should be done away from populated areas to avoid spreading foul odors. Follow this method three to five times to achieve healing. Other substances like Mituo monk and talcum powder are merely used to block the scent and treat the residue.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those suffering from underarm odor, there is oil and moisture present in the ears. Take one large field snail and raise it in water until its shell opens. Then, take a single seed of cowbean, pierce it with a needle, and place it inside the snail. Turn it upside down in a bowl, letting it sit overnight in summer, or for five to six nights in winter, until a liquid forms. Use this liquid to apply under the armpits, eliminating the odor completely.</p>
<p>Another method: First, apply rouge to the armpits. When the area emitting the odor turns yellow, take the prepared snail without the shell and place it over the smelly area. Secure it tightly with silk cloth, allowing the odor to be expelled through the bowels, thereby eliminating it.</p>
<p>Root removal method for underarm odor: First, shave off body hair and cleanse the area. Mix white powder with water to apply to the affected area. After six to seven days, observe if a small dark spot appears, about the size of a needle hole or a pin tip; this indicates that the odor is being expelled. Use a pen to mark it, and then take small moxa sticks about the size of a grain of rice and burn seven pieces at that spot. If after moxibustion there is a heart pain, apply another remedy consisting of three fen of Qingmu Xiang and three fen of cloves, eight fen of betel nut, one qian of sandalwood, a little musk, and three qian of rhubarb, boiled in water to drink. If no effect is seen, take an additional two qian of rhubarb and repeat.</p>
<p>Another method: Mix three sheng of lime with one sheng of silver dust or alternatively copper dust. Combine these two ingredients, store them in a silk sack, and apply the powder when sweating; it&#39;s effective.</p>
<p>Another method: On New Year’s Day, wash the underarms with urine; it is remarkably effective.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: For axillary abscess with great heat, puncture the foot&#39;s lesser yang at the fifth point; if the heat does not cease, puncture the hand&#39;s heart channel at the main point; also puncture the hand&#39;s greater yin channels at the various large joint points, three times each. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: An abscess develops in the axilla, if red and firm, it is called rice sore; treat it with stone needles, wishing for fine and long needles; use a rough needle and apply pig fat. After six days, do not cover it. If the abscess is firm and does not rupture, it is a horse knife wrapped around a goiter, needing urgent treatment. The &quot;Yao Yi Gang Mu&quot; states: In the &quot;Nei Jing,&quot; there are two methods for treating axillary swellings: the first is to address the gallbladder. The classic states: illnesses arising from the gallbladder&#39;s lesser yang channel show swelling and pain in the axillary region, which is the case. The second is to address the heart. The classic states: the heart governs the hand&#39;s jueyin channel, which, if active, results in heat of the palm and axillary swelling; one must assess the conditions of deficiency, excess, cold, and heat to determine treatment, applying moxibustion as needed.</p>

<p>The &quot;Ben Cao Gang Mu&quot; states: An elderly woman in a certain district developed a lump in her right axilla, which gradually grew to about a foot in size and eventually ulcerated.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Xuè Family Medical Cases&quot; states: Zhu Wending&#39;s mother developed a lump under her armpit due to resentment, which lasted for over twenty years. When she became angry, it swelled and became painful, with food not digesting and a lack of appetite. Dong Yuan said that continuous diarrhea and inability to consume food indicate a deficiency in the intestines and stomach. Therefore, a modified Six Gentlemen Decoction was prescribed, adding cardamom, cinnamon, dried ginger, and nutmeg. Although the diarrhea stopped, the pus remained clear, and the sore did not heal, indicating a deficiency in both qi and blood. After a month of using the Shenqi Decoction, she recovered.</p>
<p>In Henan, Zhang Chengzu, over twenty years old, had a hard swelling under his armpit, not rupturing for over ten days. His pulse was weak, and he occasionally vomited. I suggested that the hard swelling not rupturing with a weak pulse indicated a deficiency of yang qi, while the vomiting and lack of appetite indicated weak stomach qi. I initially treated him with a Six Gentlemen Decoction plus patchouli and cardamom. He argued that the vomiting during swelling should be treated as a toxic energy attacking the heart, while if it were a rupture, it should be treated as a deficiency of yin. I replied that this was merely a broad statement by Danxi. Indeed, all painful and itchy sores belong to heart fire. If the swelling is red and painful, with agitation, a strong pulse and vomiting indicate excess, thus requiring purging. If the swelling is hard and does not rupture, the weak pulse and vomiting indicate deficiency, thus requiring tonification. It is also possible for pain to damage stomach qi, or for one to experience vomiting due to cold or turbid qi; even if there are swellings or sores, strengthening the stomach and enhancing qi is still warranted. He insisted on his viewpoint and took aggressive medicine, worsening his condition. Upon further consultation, his pulse was weak yet slightly febrile. I noted that heat with a quiet pulse, blood loss with a strong pulse, and post-sweat agitation all indicate that treatment is not advisable. Ultimately, he died. </p>
<p>In conclusion, vomiting due to internal toxic energy invading from swellings occurs in about 10-20% of cases; while vomiting from moisture invading ruptures is more common, occurring in about 80-90%. How can these be treated as one and the same?<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

In cases of ulcers that have ruptured and drained clear pus, or where the ulcer edges do not come together, or where swelling is not red, with cold muscles and limbs, or with pale sweating, the condition indicates deficiency of both qi and blood, which requires tonification.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A man over fifty years old had a toxic ulcer under his armpit, with the ulcer not closing, a rapid pulse, and thirst, indicating stomach fire.

A powerful warming and spicy remedy was indicated. Therefore, he was given two applications of the Tori Warming Middle Decoction, and all symptoms subsided.
