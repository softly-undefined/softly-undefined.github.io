      <div><p><strong>The Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Volume 111</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Art of Metaphysics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Basic Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Great Discussion on the Five Movements</strong></p>
<p>Huangdi sat in the Ming Hall, beginning to establish the celestial principles, observing the eight directions, and considering the establishment of the five constants. He asked the heavenly teacher: &quot;Speaking of the movements and stillness of Heaven and Earth, the wise spirits are the recorders of these. The ascent and descent of Yin and Yang, cold and heat reveal their signs.&quot; I have heard about the numbers of the five movements from my teacher, who spoke of how each of the five energies governs the respective years. The first cycle establishes the movements: Earth governs the first and sixth, Metal governs the second and seventh, Water governs the third and eighth, Wood governs the fourth and ninth, and Fire governs the fifth and tenth.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>At the time of Zi and Wu, the Lesser Yin governs; at the time of Chou and Wei, the Greater Yin governs; at the time of Yin and Shen, the Lesser Yang governs; at the time of Mao and You, the Yangming governs; at the time of Chen and Xu, the Greater Yang governs; at the time of Si and Hai, the Jueyin governs. What is the reason for the disharmony of Yin and Yang? </p>
<p>(Note: I have heard about the numbers of the Five Movements from the Master, who said that the Qi of the Five Movements has already been discussed in the theory of the Six Seasonal Organs; thus, I will explain it. Guiyuqu again discusses the Five Movements and Six Qis in relation to the years, which is known as the Grand Treatise on the Celestial Origin. The disharmony of Yin and Yang arises when the Yin-Yang of the Five Movements and Six Qis do not align.)</p>
<p>Qibo said: This is the clarified way. This is the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth. As for the quantifiable numbers, they represent the Yin and Yang within humans. Thus, the harmonious numbers can be obtained. Yin and Yang are quantifiable to ten, extrapolated to a hundred, quantifiable to a thousand, extrapolated to ten thousand.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The yin and yang of heaven and earth cannot be quantified; they are understood through symbols. The discussion in the text refers to the five movements and six atmospheres that interact and govern, illustrating the principles of yin and yang in the universe. The quantifiable yin and yang are those within humans. This human yin and yang give rise to the five elements and three vital energies. Three relates to heaven, three relates to earth, and three relates to humanity. When threes combine, they form nine. Nine divides into nine regions, which correspond to the nine organs, aligning with the six divisions of heaven. This represents the harmony between human yin and yang and the cosmos, where the quantities can indeed be counted. However, the yin and yang of heaven and earth are vast—countable in tens and hundreds, and extrapolated into the thousands and tens of thousands—making them beyond mere quantification, understood only through symbolic representation.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>The symbol of the celestial phenomena refers to the red, black, blue, white, and original celestial phenomena discussed in the following text, which represent the southern and northern diagrams. The Emperor said, &quot;I wish to know their origins.&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;Your question is indeed profound! I have reviewed the text of the &#39;Records of the Original Celestial Elements&#39;: The red celestial energy travels through the Ox, the Maiden, and the Wu division; the black celestial energy travels through the Heart, the Tail, and the Ji division; the blue celestial energy travels through the Danger, the Room, the Willow, and the Ghost; the white celestial energy travels through the Ascendant, the Earth, the Spirits, and the End; the original celestial energy travels through the Zhang, the Ji, the Lou, and the Stomach. The so-called Wu and Ji division refers to the Well, the Jade, the Horn, and the Chariot, which are the gates of Heaven and Earth. The origin of these signs and the generation of the Way must not be overlooked. This discusses the transformation of the five elements, which begins from the celestial signs of the five directions. Red represents fire energy. The Ox and the Maiden are at the point of Gui, traveling through the Ox and Maiden Wu division; the combination of Wu and Gui transforms into fire. Black represents earth energy.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The heart and tail are at the position of Jia, linked to the heart and tail; when they are separated, Jia and Ji unite to transform into earth. Cang, the color blue, is the essence of wood. Wei and Shi are at the position of Ren, while Liu and Gui are at the position of Ding; Ding and Ren unite to transform into wood. Su, the color white, is the essence of metal. Kang and Di are at the position of Yi, while Mao and Bi are at the position of Geng; Yi and Geng unite to transform into metal. Yuan, the color black, is the essence of water. Zhang and Ji are at the position of Bing, while Lou and Wei are at the position of Xin; Bing and Xin unite to transform into water. Wu and Ji occupy the central palace, serving as the gateways of heaven and earth. The &quot;Dun Jia Jing&quot; states: six Wu form the heavenly gate, six Ji form the earthly door, located in the divisions of Kui, Bi, Jiao, and Zhen. Kui and Bi are in the Kan direction, while Jiao and Zhen are in the Xun direction; these five essences transform to initiate the five elements, being the origin of the yin and yang of heaven and earth, which must not be disregarded. The Emperor said: Excellent.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The discussion of heaven and earth refers to the upper and lower aspects of all things and their left and right, which are the pathways of yin and yang. One does not yet understand what this means.</p>
<p>[Note: This also discusses the upper and lower aspects of the six qi. Heaven is above, at the spring it is below, and all things are generated in between, hence heaven and earth are the upper and lower of all things. The left and right refer to the interstitial qi; the interstitial qi is the marker of movement, thus it is called the pathway of yin and yang.]</p>
<p>Qibo said: What is referred to as upper and lower is seen throughout the year, indicating where yin and yang exist.</p>
<p>[Note: This reflects on the positioning of the heavenly controls in relation to the springs. For example, in the year of Zi-Wu, Shaoyin is above, while Yangming is below; in the year of Chou-Wei, Taiyin is above, while Taiyang is below; in the year of Yin-Shen, Shaoyang is above, while Jueyin is below; in the year of Yin-Yin, Yangming is above, while Shaoyin is below; in the year of Chen-Xu, Taiyang is above, while Taiyin is below; in the year of Si-Hai, Jueyin is above, while Shaoyang is below.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The text discusses the positions of various energies or elements based on orientation. When facing north, the arrangement is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>When Xuéyīn is on top, Shǎoyīn is to the left, and Tàiyáng is to the right. </li>
<li>When Shǎoyīn is on top, Tàiyīn is to the left, and Xuéyīn is to the right. </li>
<li>When Tàiyīn is on top, Shǎoyáng is to the left, and Shǎoyīn is to the right. </li>
<li>When Shǎoyáng is on top, Yángmíng is to the left, and Tàiyīn is to the right. </li>
<li>When Yángmíng is on top, Tàiyáng is to the left, and Shǎoyáng is to the right. </li>
<li>When Tàiyáng is on top, Xuéyīn is to the left, and Yángmíng is to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>This indicates how the positions relate depending on the direction one faces, with the east representing left and the west representing right.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The text describes the orientation of images according to cardinal directions. When facing south, one&#39;s face is to the north to observe the representations, indicating their positions in relation to top, bottom, left, and right. The Emperor asks, &quot;What is considered &#39;down&#39;?&quot; Qi Bo explains: when Jue Yin is above, Shao Yang is below, with Yang Ming on the left and Tai Yin on the right; when Shao Yin is above, Yang Ming is below, with Tai Yang on the left and Shao Yang on the right; when Tai Yin is above, Tai Yang is below, with Jue Yin on the left and Yang Ming on the right; when Shao Yang is above, Jue Yin is below, with Shao Yin on the left and Tai Yang on the right; when Yang Ming is above, Shao Yin is below, with Tai Yin on the left and Jue Yin on the right; when Tai Yang is above, Tai Yin is below, with Shao Yang on the left and Shao Yin on the right. This describes the positions by facing south and indicating what is observed. The note clarifies the relative positions of left and right below: for instance, in the year of Si and Hai, Jue Yin is above, hence Shao Yang is below, with Yang Ming to the left of Shao Yang and Tai Yin to the right.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>In the Year of the Rat and the Horse, when Lesser Yin is above, then Greater Yang is below; and Greater Yang is to the left of Greater Yin, while Lesser Yang is to the right. In the Year of the Ox and the Sheep, when Greater Yin is above, then Greater Yang is below; and Lesser Yin is to the left of Greater Yang, while Greater Yang is to the right. In the Year of the Tiger and the Monkey, when Lesser Yang is above, then Lesser Yin is below; and Lesser Yin is to the left of Lesser Yin, while Greater Yang is to the right. In the Year of the Rabbit and the Rooster, when Greater Yang is above, then Lesser Yin is below; and Greater Yin is to the left of Lesser Yin, while Lesser Yin is to the right. In the Year of the Dragon and the Dog, when Greater Yang is above, then Greater Yin is below; and Lesser Yang is to the left of Greater Yin, while Lesser Yin is to the right. This is because the diagram faces north, and people face south to observe it.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Based on what is seen above and below, left and right, their positions are determined; hence it is said to articulate what is seen. </p>
<p>When the upper and lower elements encounter each other, and the cold and heat come together, the energy harmonizes if they are compatible, but if they are not, illness arises. </p>
<p>The reference to &quot;coming together&quot; refers to the six atmospheric energies. It indicates that when the energies from the heavens meet with those of the springs, the upper and lower energies encounter each other, and the energies between left and right also interact, then the four seasons come together. For example, when the energy of the sun and the cold water interacts in the first half of the year, the energies of lesser yin and lesser yang related to warmth and heat also come forth in the second half of the year. Conversely, if the energy of warmth prevails in the first half of the year, then the cold water energy emerges in the second half. </p>
<p>By considering the elements of cold and heat, the six energies are sequenced, primarily focusing on the upper and lower elements of the year, while the six energies on the left and right mark the passage of time. When they align with the season, harmony occurs; when they are opposed, illness arises. </p>
<p>The emperor asked: &quot;What does it mean when incompatible energies cause illness?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;When the lower influences extend upwards, it is not in proper position.&quot;<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The note states that there is a connection and a disconnection between the six qi influenced by the incoming energy and the six qi of the governing time. When the qi are in harmony, it is like the qi of the Lesser Yin&#39;s fire associating with the qi of the Lesser Yang&#39;s fire, representing the relationship between sovereign and minister. The sovereign&#39;s position is above, while the minister&#39;s position is below; when the sovereign fire influences the minister fire above it, this is in accordance with the order. Conversely, when the minister fire influences the sovereign fire above it, this is an improper inversion of their positions. The &quot;Essence of the Six Subtleties&quot; states: a sovereign above is in accordance, while a minister above is in opposition. Opposition brings immediate illness and swift harm; accordance brings distant illness and subtle harm. This refers to the two types of fire.</p>
<p>The Emperor then asked: &quot;What about movement and stillness?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The one above moves right, while the one below moves left. When they move around the celestial sphere, they eventually converge again.&quot; </p>
<p>The note states that movement and stillness are the principles of heaven and earth. The overarching entity governs the heavens, while the lower entity governs the earth.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If you are young and yin is above, then yangming must be below. The 365 days of the celestial cycle: those above move right in accordance with the moon; those below move left in accordance with the sun. The cycles of heaven move in six-year intervals, still accounting for the six years of noon, mid-afternoon, evening, dusk, night, and midnight, which then turn back to meet once more. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: I have heard that in the area of the ghost’s division, what responds to the earth is stillness. Now you say that those below move to the left; I do not understand what you mean. I wish to hear how this comes to be.</p>
<p>(Note: Stillness is the essence of the earth. Birth refers to what arises from movement.)</p>
<p>Qibo said: The movement and stillness of heaven and earth, and the changes of the five elements—although the ghostly division above observes these, it still cannot fully illuminate them.</p>
<p>(Note: The movement and stillness of heaven and earth refer to the qi of the springs surrounding and rotating the earth. The changes of the five elements refer to the cyclical and repeated transitions of the five phases.)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The above mentions that in a brief moment up to ten generations, one can only predict the movements of the heavens and the still forms of the earth; yet, one cannot fully comprehend the operations of heaven and earth, yin and yang. The function of transformation manifests in the heavens as signs and in the earth as forms; the seven luminaries weave through the void, and the five elements flourish on the earth. The earth is that which bears all living forms. The void is that which aligns with the essence and energy of heaven. The movement of form and essence is akin to the roots and branches of a tree. By gazing up at their signs, even distant knowledge can be attained. </p>
<p>(Note: The use of transformation refers to the movement of heaven and earth’s yin and yang. In heaven, it is formless and manifests as signs; in earth, it has form and becomes established. The seven luminaries refer to the sun, moon, and five planets. The void is the space that is woven between the great void, also rotating around the earth. The five elements are the forms that arise from the five directions and their corresponding energies. The earth is that which bears all living things.)<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The essence is the refined water born of the One in Heaven. The essence and energy responding to Heaven are, above, the energy, and below, the water. Water responds to Heaven, and thus Heaven connects to water. The form is called the body of the Earth, tranquil and unmoving. The movement of the essence within the form refers to the swirling of the subterranean energy at springs, as the roots remain still while the branches and leaves sway, yet the root energy is interconnected with the branches and leaves. Looking up to observe the celestial phenomena, one sees the sun, moon, and five stars revolving around the Earth in a clockwise motion; though the path is deep and distant, it is knowable.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Is the Earth indeed below? Qibo replied: The Earth is below for mankind; it exists within the great void. The Emperor asked: What supports it? Qibo replied: It is upheld by the great energy.</p>
<p>(Note: The statement about the Earth being below refers to Heaven being above and the Earth below. The great void refers to the essence of emptiness, indicating that the Earth exists within this void, upheld by great energy, without any support.)<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>According to the &quot;Theory of the Universe,&quot; it is said: The shape of heaven resembles a bird&#39;s egg, with the earth contained within; heaven wraps around the earth like the egg white surrounding the yolk, round like a pellet, hence it is called the &quot;Harmonious Sky.&quot; This indicates that its form is holistic; its principle suggests that heaven covers half of the earth above, and half is below. Above ground, heaven is observed at an angle of one hundred eighty-two and a half degrees, and the same is true underground. The North Pole rises thirty-six degrees above ground, while the South Pole descends thirty-six degrees below ground, with Mount Song situated exactly at the zenith of heaven.</p>
<p>Drought dries it, heat steams it, wind moves it, moisture moistens it, cold hardens it, and fire warms it. Thus, wind and cold are below, dryness and heat are above, humidity is in the middle, and fire moves among them; cold and heat both enter the mix, leading to the vacuity that fosters transformation.</p>
<p>(Note: Wind, cold, heat, humidity, dryness, and fire are formless qi in heaven. Dryness, steaming, movement, moistening, hardening, and warming are the tangible signs of earth.)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Heaven envelops the earth, which is why it exists above the sky, below the springs, and among the land, beyond the eight extremes, and within the six directions, reaching everywhere. This refers to the vastness of the void, which not only encompasses the outside of the earth but also penetrates through its depths. Cold water lies below, while wind arises from the interaction of earth and water, thus cold winds reside beneath. Dryness corresponds to the energy of the dry metal, while heat corresponds to the fire of the sun, hence dry heat is above. Soil occupies the center, so moisture resides within. Fire is the primal Yang of the supreme ultimate, that is, the vital energy of heaven, thus it moves between above and below. The Book of Changes states: &quot;The sun and moon move in cycles, one cold and one hot.&quot; As cold and heat alternate, the energies of the six elements all enter the earth, allowing the tangible earth to receive the intangible void energy, and thus engender all things. Therefore, when dryness prevails, the land becomes dry; when heat prevails, the land becomes hot; when wind prevails, the land moves; when moisture prevails, the land turns muddy; when cold prevails, the land cracks; when fire prevails, the land solidifies. </p>
<p>(Note: This also relates back to the previous mention of the six entries.)<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The Emperor said: How can one assess the qi of Heaven and Earth? Qi Bo replied: The qi of Heaven and Earth is the product of triumph and renewal, and it cannot be captured in diagnosis. The method of pulse diagnosis states: The changes of Heaven and Earth cannot be diagnosed through the pulse. This is what it means.</p>
<p>[Note: The qi of Heaven and Earth refers to the five movements and six qi. The creator of triumph and renewal refers to excessive victory and stagnation. It is said that the changes in qi and movements that cause the people&#39;s ailments cannot be known through diagnosis. Each year has the six qi governed by the celestial officials, the five movements governed by the annual patron, the added influences of intermediate qi, and the main qi of the four seasons. When individuals are caught in the interplay of the qi of Heaven and Earth, if one qi is disharmonious, it leads to ailments among the people. Thus, the qi of the four seasonal atmospheres causes the people&#39;s ailments, which cannot be diagnosed through pulses but rather indicates the disharmony of specific qi.]<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The text states: &quot;Regarding diseases caused by hidden pathogens, they are assessed through intention. If there is a hidden pathogen within the month, assuming there was already a latent condition, pulse examination must be conducted. The energies of heaven and earth, when excessive, will suppress opposing energies, leading to latent conditions. The people affected will experience illness from this suppressed state, which does not manifest during diagnosis. Therefore, to understand diseases caused by hidden pathogens, one must intuitively assess them, observing any disharmonies of energy within the month, thus recognizing the presence of latent illness among the people. When the suppressed energy flares up and illness begins, it will then become recognizable in the pulse. Hence, it is stated: if there was already a hidden pathogen, pulse examination must be conducted. This is different from sudden issues caused by external forces like wind, cold, heat, or dampness, which can immediately show up during pulse diagnosis. Therefore, it is said: the energies of heaven and earth cannot be diagnosed through pulse examination. It is with this understanding.&quot; The emperor then asked: &quot;What about intermittent energy?&quot;<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: The term &quot;intermediary qi&quot; refers to the six qi added to the existing conditions. The qi applies both above and below, and the combination forms six qi, which is why it is termed &quot;intermediary qi.&quot; Each qi pertains to one of the four seasons and governs a period of sixty days, thus the term &quot;intermediary qi&quot; is related to the measurement of time. It is based on the understanding that sixty days plus eighty-seven and a half ke constitutes a single step.</p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The location of the qi is to be considered on the left and right sides.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The &quot;Six Subtle Principles&quot; states: above the heavenly axis, the heavenly qi governs; below the heavenly axis, the earthly qi governs. It also states: &quot;addition&quot; refers to earthly qi, while &quot;middle&quot; pertains to heavenly qi. The qi below turns left, while the qi above rotates right, each governing sixty days to complete a year. Thus, it is said to observe the position of qi and consider the left and right rotations. For instance, in the year of the Rat, if the Lesser Yin is above, then the Yangming is below. If the Lesser Yin is above, then the Jueyin is on the left and the Taiyin is on the right. With Yangming below, the Taiyang is on the left and the Shaoyang is on the right.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The essence of the earth turns to the left, governing the initial qi, which is why the sun presides over the first day of the first month, with the first moment in the sub-chamber of the tiger representing the beginning. Next is Jueyin, followed by Shaoyin, in charge of the heavenly qi, completing the three qi and overseeing the year above half. Following that is Taiyin, then Shaoyang, and finally Yangming, which governs the qi of the springs, completing the six qi and overseeing the year below half. Each is supplemented by an additional sixty days to finalize a year. The six qi circulate in the same manner.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How is the period determined? Qibo replied: Following its qi brings harmony; opposing it leads to disease.</p>
<p>Note: The interstitial qi is the guest qi that accompanies the main. During a year, there are also the six qi that govern the times. If the main follows its guests, harmony prevails; if it goes against them, illness arises. For instance, in the Year of the Rat and Horse, the initial qi, associated with the cold water of the sun, governs the qi related to Jueyin, which is connected to wind and wood. If cold dominates wind, it aligns; if wind overcomes cold, it is contrary. Hence, it is stated in the lower scriptures: the main overcomes the contrary, and the guest overcomes the aligned. This applies to all six qi. Disease arises when one is not in their proper position.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Those who do not occupy their proper place will be influenced by those below them, as mentioned above. Transitioning positions leads to illness. </p>
<p>As for the initial energy, when the cold water of the Sun is present, it turns warm. In the case of the third energy, when the True Yin&#39;s fire arrives, it becomes cold. When the energies of their original positions interchange, this reversal of energy causes suffering among the people. This applies to all six energies. </p>
<p>Failing to maintain one&#39;s proper position brings danger. </p>
<p>By &quot;failing to maintain one&#39;s position,&quot; it refers to losing control of one&#39;s foundational responsibilities. For instance, in the Year of the Rat or the Year of the Goat, when the Great Yin is in charge of the heavens, the initial guest energy and the primary energy are both governing the Wood of the True Yin Wind, while the cleansing and refreshing energy, unable to withstand this, gets insulted; thus, the Metal has lost its proper position. In the case of the fifth energy, the dryness of the Yangming Metal leads to a deficiency in its original position. When the child energy of Wind and Wood seeks revenge, and the fire&#39;s heat presses down on Metal, this results in severe illness and great danger, referred to as being insulted and consequently suffering from adversity.</p>
<p>A reversal in proportions can lead to death.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>&quot;During the years of southern and northern governance, there is a distinction between the responses of inches and feet. If there is a response or no response, but there is still a reaction, this is referred to as the contradiction of dimensions. When yin and yang interact, there is death.</p>
<p>In the years of governance, there is an imbalance in left and right dimensions. The left represents yang and the right represents yin; inches represent yang and feet represent yin. If yin and yang react correspondingly, there is death. </p>
<p>First, establish the year to understand its essence; observe the left and right responses, and only then can one discuss the reversals and alignments of life and death.</p>
<p>This summarizes the forces of the six qi. First, determine the year of the main qi to understand its celestial influence at the spring, and then observe the responses of the intervening qi on the left and right, either aligning or opposing, thus enabling a discussion on the reversals and alignments of life and death.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How do cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire interact with humanity? How do they transform and give rise to all things?</p>
<p>Qibo replied: The east generates wind, wind generates wood, wood generates sourness, sourness generates the liver, the liver generates tendons, and tendons generate the heart.</p>
<p>This discusses the qi of heaven and earth and its connection to the people and all things.&quot;<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Human beings embody the essence of the five elements and flavors of heaven and earth. In heaven, it is the primal source; in humanity, it is the Way; on earth, it is transformation, which gives rise to the five flavors. The Way gives birth to wisdom, the primal source produces divinity, and transformation generates vitality. The divine manifests as wind in the heavens, as wood on earth, as tendons in the body, as softness in the qi, and as the liver in the organs.</p>
<p>This describes the unpredictable changes of yin and yang, operating between heaven, earth, and humanity. The primal source, the Way, the transformation, and the tangible five phases, five bodies, and five organs are all manifestations of the miraculous and formless action of the divine. Softness refers to the gentle quality of the wind and wood.</p>
<p>Its nature is warm, its virtue is harmony, its function is movement, its color is green, and its transformation is flourishing. Its insects are like fine hair. Its governance is dispersive, its commands are disseminated, its changes can be destructive, its calamities are falling, its flavor is sour, and its ambition is anger. Anger harms the liver, while sadness overcomes anger. Wind harms the liver, while dryness overcomes wind. Sourness harms the tendons, while pungency overcomes sourness.</p>
<p>The nature refers to the essence of the five elements. Transformation of virtue signifies the auspiciousness of qi. Governance and commands represent the order of qi. Changes and calamities reflect the mutability of qi.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The user is the movement of the body. The caterpillar embodies the dense energy of the forest. Heaven has five elements, which control five positions to create cold, heat, dryness, humidity, and wind. Humans have five viscera, which transform five energies to produce joy, anger, worry, contemplation, and fear. Thus, humans are nurtured by these five energies and five flavors, yet can also be harmed by them in their five sentiments. It is like water, which can carry a boat but can also capsize it. Therefore, the people of ancient times practiced moderation in diet and had regular routines, flowing with the transformations of heaven and earth to harmonize their yin and yang, thus avoiding severe illness and consistently preserving their fate. In today’s era, those who understand the shifts of the seasons can avoid disasters and misfortunes—this not only allows for the governance of people but also for the nurturing of life. Extending this further can save the populace for generations to come.</p>
<p>The south generates heat; heat produces fire; fire yields bitterness; bitterness creates the heart; the heart generates blood; blood nurtures the spleen. In the heavens, this translates to heat; on earth, it manifests as fire; within the body, it is the pulse; in the atmosphere, it is the breath; within the organs, it is the heart. Its nature embodies summer heat, its virtue is prominence, its function is restlessness, its color is red, and its transformation is flourishing.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The insect&#39;s wings, its governance is bright, its commands are dense and steamy, its transformations are fiery and flickering, its afflictions are scorched and burned, its flavor is bitter, its will is joy. Joy harms the heart, fear prevails over joy. Heat harms the qi, cold prevails over heat. Bitterness harms the qi, saltiness prevails over bitterness. </p>
<p>[Note: The essence here reflects the fervent energy of fire and the dynamic nature of restless fire. The insect&#39;s wings signify the fiery essence moving in the void both above and below. The extremes of burning and scorching denote the peak of heat. At extremes, transformations occur, leading to disasters and afflictions.]</p>
<p>In the center, dampness is born; dampness gives rise to earth; earth gives rise to sweetness; sweetness produces the spleen; the spleen produces meat; meat generates the lungs. In the heavens, it is damp; on earth, it is soil; in the body, it is meat; in the atmosphere, it is fullness; in the organs, it is the spleen. Its nature is tranquil and inclusive; its virtue is moistening; its function is transformation; its color is yellow; its transformation is abundance. The insect is sluggish, its governance is serene, its commands are clouds and rain, its transformations are movements of precipitation, its afflictions are indulgent and overwhelming, its flavor is sweet, its will is contemplation. Contemplation harms the spleen, anger prevails over contemplation. Dampness harms meat, wind prevails over dampness. Sweetness harms the spleen, sourness prevails over sweetness.</p>
<p>[Note: Fullness refers to the earth&#39;s energy being pervasive in all directions.]<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The nature of stillness is that of the earth, which encompasses the four seasons and includes the four atmospheric qualities of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. It is the medium through which all things are transformed and created. Worms, the creatures of flesh, are born from the earth. Clouds and rain are the rising of moisture. Movement leads to indulgence and collapse, which is the extreme of dampness.</p>
<p>In the west, dryness arises, leading to the production of metal; metal generates bitterness, which gives rise to the lungs; the lungs produce skin and fur; and skin and fur produce the kidneys. In the heavens, it is dry; on earth, it is metal; in the body, it is skin and fur; in the atmosphere, it is maturation; in the organs, it is the lungs. Its nature is cool, its virtue is purity, its function is solidification, its color is white, and its transformation is contraction. Its insect is the armor, its governance is strength, its command is mist and dew, its change is severity and killing, its affliction is pallor, its taste is bitter, and its intention is sorrow. </p>
<p>Sorrow injures the lungs, while joy overcomes sorrow. Heat damages skin and fur, while cold surpasses heat. Bitterness harms skin and fur, while sourness prevails over bitterness. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Maturation&quot; refers to the completion of all things in response to autumn&#39;s atmosphere. &quot;Solidification&quot; pertains to the function of hard metal. &quot;Armor insect&quot; symbolizes the exterior covered in armoring metal.)<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The force of strictness is that when things are overly abundant, there will be a need for extermination; at that time, it is represented by metal and military symbols. The fallen are those that succumb to overwhelming strictness and perish.</p>
<p>In the north, cold is born; from cold comes water, from water arises saltiness, from saltiness comes the kidneys, from the kidneys the bone marrow, and from the marrow the liver. In the heavens, it represents cold; on earth, it signifies water; in the body, it pertains to bones; in the spirit, it is hardiness; in the organs, it relates to the kidneys. Its nature is severe, and its virtue is cold. Its function is [lacking]. Its color is black, its transformation is strictness, and it produces scales and insects. Its governance is tranquility, and its command is [lacking]. Its transformation is freezing and biting; its misfortunes are hail; its flavor is salty; its intention is fear. Fear injures the kidneys, while thought overcomes fear. Cold injures the blood, dryness surpasses cold. Salty injures the blood, sweetness surpasses saltiness.</p>
<p>[Note: Hardiness is a transformation of cold energy. Tranquility pertains to the governance of water. Scales and insects arise from water. Freezing is the extreme of cold. Hail is a transformation of water.]</p>
<p>The five energies are established in succession, each having its precedence. If not in its proper position, it becomes aberrant; if in its proper position, it is correct.</p>
<p>[Note: The five energies correspond to the energies of the five directions. The succession reflects the interchange of the four seasons.]<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Each has its own lead, like the spring breeze, summer heat, autumn coolness, and winter cold, all arriving in proper order and corresponding to their designated positions — the right energy of the four seasons. If in winter it becomes hot instead of cold, or in summer it becomes cold instead of hot, it is out of its rightful place and thus harmful. Such harm is a thief of all things. The Emperor asked: How about the changes that cause illness? Qi Bo replied: When the energies are harmonious, illnesses are mild; when they are not harmonious, they become severe. </p>
<p>This discusses how the energies of the four seasons relate to the illnesses of the people. When the five energies are in their rightful positions, illnesses remain mild. If they are not harmonious and deviating from their proper positions, then the illnesses will be severe. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What governs the year? Qi Bo replied: When the energy is abundant, it controls what it overcomes and bullies what it cannot. If the energy is deficient, then what it cannot overcome becomes the bully, while it becomes light against what it can overcome. </p>
<p>This further discusses the governing of the five movements throughout the year, indicating the consequences of excess or insufficiency. For instance, if the wood element is excessive in the year, it controls the earth energy it overcomes, while bullying the metal energy it cannot overcome.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>If one is insufficient, then the metal energy that they cannot overcome will insult and dominate them; the earth energy that they can overcome will come to belittle and insult them. The five movements are all the same, revolving and restarting. </p>
<p>Insults turn into backlash. To insult and then receive backlash is due to a lack of fear. The emperor said: &quot;Well said.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: This speaks of the cycle of insult and backlash. If the wood of the year is insufficient, then the metal energy that one cannot overcome will insult and dominate, causing the metal to undercut its own position. In the time of autumn, when the metal energy is weak and receives the child energy of wood in return, it is hot fire that melts metal; this is what is meant by the insult leading to backlash. The insult arises because the wood energy is insufficient, yet the metal energy can restrain the wood, making it less fearful. This passage discusses the energies of the five movements, focusing on the year and the time, while also addressing the dynamics of the six energies in relation to one another. The union of the five and six is what forms the year.]</p>
<p>The energies of the five movements and six energies govern the year&#39;s cycles, addressing both excess and insufficiency and the influences of interstitial energies. </p>
<p>[Note: The sections on years and movements are summarized through this diagram; the five movements, six energies, heavenly officials, interstitial energies, and the governing of time and years are all encompassed here. By correlating weather, public health, and various conditions, everything becomes clear without needing excessive elaboration.]<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>The Great Discussion of the Six Subtleties</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Alas! So distant. The Way of Heaven is like welcoming floating clouds, like gazing into a deep abyss. The deep abyss can still be measured, but welcoming floating clouds knows no limits. </p>
<p>[Note: The Way of Heaven refers to the way of yin and yang. It speaks of the way of yin and yang, which is high and deep. That which has form can still be measured, but what exists in Heaven as qi is beyond knowing its limits.]</p>
<p>The Master often spoke of diligently upholding the Way of Heaven. I have heard and cherished it, in my heart I have my doubts, and do not understand its meaning. I wish the Master could expand on this, fully explaining the matter so it never fades away and endures through time. Can the Way of Heaven be made known? </p>
<p>Qibo bowed deeply and replied: Your inquiry is indeed profound, the Way of Heaven is such. This is due to the order of Heaven, the times of prosperity and decline. </p>
<p>[Note: The Way of Heaven refers to the yin and yang of Heaven. The order of Heaven is based on six as the measure, revolving around the six types of qi.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear of the Way of Heaven, the six-fold measure, and the reasons for prosperity and decline? Qibo replied: There are positions above and below, rules to the left and right. Therefore, to the right of Shaoyang is Yangming; to the right of Yangming is Taiyang; to the right of Taiyang is Jueyin; to the right of Jueyin is Shaoyin; to the right of Shaoyin is Taiyin; to the right of Taiyin is Shaoyang. This is what is known as the markers of qi, it rests in the southern direction to await it.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said: according to the order of heaven, during times of flourishing and decline, one should adjust the light and position properly, standing upright and waiting for it. This is what it means.</p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;six six&quot; refers to the three yin and three yang that govern the heavens, corresponding to the six vital energies in heaven. When there are positions above and below, it is stated that if the lesser yin is above, then the bright yang is below; if the greater yin is above, then the sun is below; if the lesser yang is above, then the decisive yin is below; if the decisive yin is above, then the lesser yin is below; if the sun is above, then the greater yin is below; if the decisive yin is above, then the lesser yang is below. The six phases rotate, each with their defined positions above and below. As for the left and right, for instance, if the lesser yin is above, then the decisive yin is on the left, and the greater yin is on the right; if the greater yin is above, then the lesser yin is on the left, and the lesser yang is on the right; if the lesser yang is above, then the sun is on the left, and the bright yang is on the right; if the bright yang is above, then the lesser yang is on the left, and the sun is on the right; if the sun is above, then the bright yang is on the left, and the decisive yin is on the right; if the decisive yin is above, then the sun is on the left, and the lesser yin is on the right. Each follows the presence of qi above, establishing a left and right distinction. Thus, the right side of the lesser yang is governed by the bright yang; the right side of the bright yang is governed by the sun. This is due to the placement of yin and yang on the right side, transitioning above and presiding over the years. The marker of qi is evident above. The celestial qi rotates clockwise, thus facing south and awaiting its orderly rotation. Moving light refers to the running of the sun and moon, determining the position of vital energy by the sun completing a full cycle around the heavens. Standing upright means standing facing south.] </p>

<p>[Note: This describes the three Yin and three Yang energies, the six transformations of energy, the foundational and standard relationships, and the insights gained. Wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire represent the celestial Yin and Yang. The three Yin and three Yang energies are revered, leading us to see the atmospheric conditions as foundational above, with the energies symbolically manifesting below.] </p>
<p>The foundational symbols differ, leading to variances in energy manifestations.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The passage discusses the six energies of the Three Yin and Three Yang, which, although responding to one another, differ individually. Shaoyin represents Yin but is inherently warm, while Taiyang represents Yang but is inherently cold; this distinction pertains to their fundamental attributes. Shaoyin and Taiyang follow their inherent nature and representation. Taiyin and Shaoyang stem from their fundamentals. Yangming and Jueyin do not follow the representation or fundamentals but arise from the middle. Thus, there are those that are derived from fundamentals, those that are derived from representations, those that derive from both representations and fundamentals, and those that are derived from observations of the middle. This illustrates the varying manifestations of the energies.</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired: &quot;What accounts for some energies being present while others are absent, some being excessively present?&quot; Qibo responded: &quot;Those that are present and complete represent harmony; those that are present but not complete indicate that the incoming energy does not reach sufficiently; those that are incomplete yet reach signify an excess of the incoming energy.&quot;</p>
<p>This discourse addresses the main energies of the Three Yin and Three Yang throughout the year, and the occurrences of excess or deficiency. When energies are present and complete, it signifies a year of balanced energies, with no excess or deficiency, where the seasonal energies arrive timely, reflecting harmony in energies. For example, if spring is supposed to be warm yet remains cold, or if summer is expected to be hot yet remains warm, this indicates presence without completeness, due to inadequate incoming energy. Conversely, if warmth arrives before spring or heat before summer, this signifies an arrival of energy that is premature and excessive, indicating an abundance of incoming energy.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>According to the Great Discussion of the Heavenly Origins, it is stated: Generally, the Yangming, Taiyin, and Jueyin govern the affairs of heaven, whereby the qi transforms and operates according to the later heaven; the Taiyang, Shaoyang, and Shaoyin govern the affairs of heaven according to the earlier heaven. In years of deficiency, the heavenly qi arrives at the later heaven; in years of surplus, the heavenly qi arrives at the earlier heaven. Moreover, the Yang years are associated with substance, while the Yin years are associated with emptiness. The years in which the celestial symbols gather are considered to have balanced qi, with neither excess nor deficiency.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about when it is expected yet does not arrive, or when it arrives before expected? Qibo replied: If it responds, it aligns; otherwise, it is contrary. When it is contrary, changes arise; when changes arise, illness occurs. </p>
<p>(Note: The years of deficiency respond yet do not arrive; the years of surplus respond before they should arrive, which is considered alignment.)<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If the year of deficiency is not reached, it arrives nonetheless; if the year of abundance is reached, it does not arrive, this is what is called contrary. When the contrary occurs, change is born, and when change is born, it becomes a disaster for the people. The Emperor said: Good! Please speak of its response! Qi Bo said: The response of things is born from their nature; the response of qi and channels is determined by their flow. </p>
<p>[Note: To speak of its response means to discuss the excessive or insufficient qi. The response of things is such that, for example, when the Spring of the Liver governs the heavens, silkworms remain still, and butterflies are nurtured; when the Shao Yang governs the heavens, grass and trees flourish early; when the Tai Yin governs the heavens, all things thrive. All these living things respond to the heavenly phenomena. The response of qi and channels indicates that when the Tai Yang governs the heavens, cold descends into the vast void, and yang qi is not permitted; when the Yang Ming governs the heavens, yang rules its command, and summer heat prevails; when the Tai Yin governs the heavens, yin rules its authority, and yang qi retreats.]<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>When it reaches Jueyin, its pulse is string-like; when it reaches Shaoyin, its pulse is hooked; when it reaches Taiyin, its pulse is deep; when it reaches Shaoyang, it is large and floating; when it reaches Yangming, it is short and thin; when it reaches Taiyang, it is large and long. All these correspond to the energies and pulses.</p>
<p>The emperor said: Good! I wish to hear about the geographical correspondences of the six solar terms. Qibo replied: To the right of Xiangming is the position of Jun fire. To the right of Jun fire, step back one position, and the position of Xiang fire governs it: move back one more step, and the Earth energy governs it; move back one more step, and the Metal energy governs it; move back one more step, and the Water energy governs it; move back one more step, and the Wood energy governs it; move back one more step, and Jun fire governs it.</p>
<p>[Note: This discussion relates to the six solar terms and their seasonal dominances. Energy positions refer to the steps governed by the six energies. Xiangming refers to the beginning of spring, which indicates the initial energy. The right of Xiangming is the position of Shaoyin Jun fire, governing the second energy. Stepping back one position means moving one step rightward. The right of Jun fire is the position of Shaoyang Xiang fire, governing the third energy. Stepping back one more position brings us to Taiyin damp Earth, governing the fourth energy; stepping back one more brings us to Yangming dry Metal, governing the fifth energy; stepping back one more brings us to Taiyang cold Water, governing the sixth energy; stepping back one more brings us to Jueyin wind Wood, governing the initial energy; and stepping back one more brings us back to the position of Shaoyin Jun fire, representing the cyclical nature.]<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Under the influence of fire, water regulates it; beneath water&#39;s level, earth supports it; below earth&#39;s level, wind sustains it; under wind&#39;s level, metal supports it; beneath metal&#39;s level, fire sustains it; under the influence of the sovereign fire, the essence of yin supports it. The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qibo replied: Excess leads to harm; support leads to control, and control leads to transformation. Externally, the cycles of prosperity and decline indicate harm leads to chaos, and transformation can lead to great illness.</p>
<p>(Note: This passage discusses the interrelationships of the six qi and how they influence each other, emphasizing the principles of generation, control, and the importance of proper regulation to avoid excess and imbalance in natural phenomena.)<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>If the water rises without soil to contain it, then the water overflows and extinguishes the fire; without soil to regulate the water, the water rises even more. Thus, excess leads to harm among the five elements, causing chaos in the processes of growth and transformation, resulting in significant afflictions. The external manifestations of prosperity and decline refer to the energy of the year, which can have both abundance and scarcity. If the energy of the year and the energy of the time both become excessively strong, the harm becomes even greater. Therefore, it is said that harm leads to chaos and significant afflictions.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What are prosperity and decline? Qibo replied: When it is out of place, it is evil; when it is in place, it is correct. When evil prevails, changes are extreme; when correct, changes are subtle.</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the years of excess and deficiency in energy. When it is out of place, it means that the energy is excessive and subdues what it should conquer while taking offense against what it can’t conquer – this is the prosperity of the year. When the energy is insufficient, it means that what it can&#39;t conquer is offensive, and what it should conquer is slighted – this is the decline of the year. In both cases, they fail to maintain their proper positions, and thus there arises internal evil. When it is in place, it is a year of balanced energy, with no excessive or insufficient oppression, and each maintains its proper position; this is the correct energy. When there is evil, changes are extreme; when there is correctness, changes are subtle.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What is meant by being in place? Qibo replied: Wood operates in the East, fire operates in the South, earth operates across the four seasons, metal operates in the West, and water operates in the North. This is what is meant by the meeting of the year; it signifies balanced energy.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The Emperor said: What if it is not the right time? Qibo replied: It is a year that does not align! [Note: This refers to a year of balanced qi, without extremes. The Wood cycle corresponds to the Year of Dingmao; the Fire cycle corresponds to the Year of Wuwu; the Earth cycle corresponds to the Years of Jiachen, Jiaxu, Jichou, and Jiwwei; the Metal cycle corresponds to the Year of Yiyou; the Water cycle corresponds to the Year of Bingzi. As the transformations of the heavenly stems align with the ruling years of the earthly branches, this year is considered aligned, thus a year of balanced qi. If it is not a year of alignment, then there will be extremes in excess and deficiency, which is considered not the right time.] The Emperor said: In the year of the Earth cycle, the Taiyin is seen above; in the year of the Fire cycle, Shaoyang and Shaoyin are seen above; in the year of the Metal cycle, Yangming is seen above; in the year of the Wood cycle, Jueyin is seen above; in the year of the Water cycle, Taiyang is seen above. How is this? Qibo replied: It aligns with the Heaven. Therefore, the &quot;Heavenly Origin Register&quot; states: Heavenly symbols. [Note: The phenomena seen above refer to the qi of the heavens, manifested in the yearly cycles. In the year of the Earth cycle, the Taiyin is seen above, corresponding to the years Jichou and Jiwwei. In the year of the Fire cycle, Shaoyang is seen in the years Wuyin and Wushen; Shaoyin is seen in the years Wuzi and Wuwu. In the year of the Metal cycle, Yangming is seen in the years Yimao and Yiyou. In the year of the Wood cycle, Jueyin is seen in the years Dingsi and Dinghai. In the year of the Water cycle, Taiyang is seen in the years Bingchen and Bingxu.]<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The Qi of the heavens, when it merges with the Qi of the Five Movements, is called the Heavenly Sign. The Emperor asked, &quot;What is the significance of the Heavenly Sign in relation to the year?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;It is the meeting of the Great Yiy Heavenly Sign.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: When the Heavenly Sign coincides with the annual meeting, it is called Great Yiy. The Heavenly Sign corresponds to the years of Wu Wu, Ji Chou, Ji Wei, and Yi You, representing the merger of the Qi of the heavens, the Qi of the Five Movements, and the annual Qi, hence it is also referred to as the Three Mergers.)</p>
<p>The Emperor then asked, &quot;What about its nobility and baseness?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;The Heavenly Sign represents the enforcement of law, the annual meeting signifies the implementation of commands, and the Great Yiy Heavenly Sign represents nobility.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Wang Bing states that &quot;enforcement of law&quot; relates to mutual assistance, &quot;implementation of commands&quot; is like a local noble, and &quot;nobility&quot; refers to a sovereign.)</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired, &quot;What about the relevance of evil within?&quot; Qi Bo explained, &quot;In those who are within the enforcement of law, their afflictions are swift and perilous; in those within the implementation of commands, their afflictions are gradual and enduring; in those within nobility, their afflictions are abrupt and fatal.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Wang Bing adds that the enforcement of law is the standard for officials, so if it becomes corrupt, the consequences are swift and dangerous. The local noble does not have the power of enforcement, therefore harm comes slowly and is manageable. The noble&#39;s authority is inviolable, hence if afflicted, the outcome is abrupt and lethal.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How about the ease of positions?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;When a ruler is in place, ministers are compliant; when a minister occupies the position of a ruler, there is rebellion. Rebellion brings ailments closer and harms swiftly; compliance distances ailments and minimizes harm. This is referred to as the Two Fires.&quot;<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>【Note: The correspondence of geography to the six phases corresponds to the six qi of the main time, which are unchanging positions. However, there are also the additional six qi that arise in conjunction with the heavenly affairs, which revolve in six cycles, hence it is said to involve change in position. For instance, when the lesser yin lord fire is in conjunction with the lesser yang minister fire, it is a position of lord and minister in harmony; conversely, when the lesser yang minister fire is in conjunction with the lesser yin lord fire, it is a position of minister and lord in opposition. This describes the harmony and discord of the two fires.】 The Emperor said: Excellent! I wish to hear about its steps. Qi Bo said: The so-called steps involve sixty degrees and a discrepancy. Therefore, there are twenty-four steps, accumulating to a hundred divisions to complete a day. 【Note: This discusses the additional six qi in conjunction. Each qi presides over sixty days and eighty-seven and a half divisions, hence is sixty degrees with a discrepancy. Within four years, there are a total of twenty-four steps, with each step accumulating eighty-seven and a half divisions, totaling two thousand one hundred divisions. From two thousand divisions, divided across four years, the accumulation is five days, with an additional one hundred divisions, thus completing an extra day.】 The Emperor asked: How do the six qi correspond to the transformations of the five elements? Qi Bo said: Positions have beginnings and ends, and qi has initial, middle, and upper and lower aspects that differ; thus, the inquiries differ as well. 【Note: This discusses how the additional six qi correspond with the qi dominating the time, and how each is distinct. The five elements refer to the jueyin wind wood which governs the initial qi, the two fires of the lord and minister which govern the second and third qi, the taiyin damp earth which governs the fourth qi, the yangming dry metal which governs the fifth qi, and the taiyang cold water which governs the sixth qi. This refers to the five elements of the main time that maintain their positions without change.】<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>If the six qi are added based on their positions, they will correspond to the five elements of the time, thus bringing about different changes. Positions have beginnings and ends, referring to the six positions of the principal time, which start at Jueyin and end at Taiyang, having a certain foundational position. Qi has an initial and a central aspect, meaning that the six qi added begin from the initial qi of the earth and end at the central qi of the sky. The differences above and below indicate that the guest qi is added from above, while the main qi resides below, and they differ accordingly; therefore, seeking them will also be different.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: How shall we seek this? Qibo replied: The heavenly qi begins with Jia, and the earthly qi begins with Zi. When Zi and Jia combine, it is called the establishment of the year. Be diligent in observing the time, and the qi can be anticipated.</p>
<p>(Note: The heavenly stems&#39; qi begins with Jia, and the earthly branches&#39; qi begins with Zi; when Zi and Jia combine, the year is established. First establish the year to observe the time, so that the six qi added can be anticipated and determined accordingly.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to know how the six qi of the year start and end, and what are the early and late timings? </p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;year&quot; refers to the six qi appearing within the year. The beginning and end are from one moment to eighty-seven and a half moments. Early and late refer to cases like the year of the Rabbit, Rat, and Dragon, where the heavenly qi begins at one moment, indicating an early qi; whereas in the year of the Tiger, Goat, and Pig, the heavenly qi begins at seventy-six moments, indicating a late qi.)<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Qi Bo said: &quot;Do you understand? It is a question! In the Year of the Jiazi, the first Qi begins at the moment below water at the start of the day, starting at 87 units and ending at 75 units; the second Qi begins at 76 units and ends at 62.5 units; the third Qi begins at 62.6 units and ends at 50 units; the fourth Qi begins at 51 units and ends at 37.5 units; the fifth Qi begins at 37.6 units and ends at 25 units. The so-called &#39;Initial Six&#39; corresponds to the celestial numbers.</p>
<p>[Note: The celestial numbers are derived from the count of days in a year, corresponding to a complete cycle of 365.25 days. The first Qi begins on the New Moon of the Yin month, with the moment below water starting at 87.5 units, ending at 60 days with 87.5 units. The total of the six Qis amounts to 360 days and 525 units, which equates to 365 days and 25 units. Thus, the Initial Six Qi corresponds to the celestial numbers.] </p>
<p>In the Year of Yichou, the first Qi starts at 26 units and ends at 12.5 units; the second Qi starts at 12.6 units and ends at a hundred units below water; the third Qi begins at 1 unit and ends at 87.5 units; the fourth Qi starts at 87.6 units and ends at 75 units; the fifth Qi begins at 76 units and ends at 62.5 units; the sixth Qi starts at 62.6 units and ends at 50 units. The so-called &#39;Six Two&#39; corresponds to the celestial numbers.&quot;<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>In the year of Bingyin, the initial qi began at the fifty-first ke and ended at thirty-seven and a half ke; the second qi began at thirty-seven and six minutes and ended at twenty-five ke; the third qi began at twenty-six ke and ended at twelve and a half ke; the fourth qi began at twelve and six minutes and ended at the hundredth ke below the water; the fifth qi began at one ke and ended at eighty-seven and a half ke; the sixth qi began at eighty-seven and six minutes and ended at seventy-five ke. The so-called six and three corresponds to the numbers of heaven. In this year of Bingyin, the initial qi started in the previous two years, at seven hundred and thirty-one days and fifty-one ke; it finished at one thousand and ninety-six days and seventy-five ke, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five ke. This is known as the six qis of the three years.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In the year of Ding Mao, during the initial qi, the heavenly cycles begin at seventy-six divisions and end at sixty-two and a half divisions; during the second qi, it begins at sixty-two and six tenths and ends at fifty divisions; during the third qi, it starts at fifty-one divisions and ends at thirty-seven and a half divisions; during the fourth qi, it begins at thirty-seven and six tenths and ends at twenty-five divisions; during the fifth qi, it starts at twenty-six divisions and ends at twelve and a half divisions; during the sixth qi, it begins at twelve and six tenths and ends at below one hundred divisions of water. The so-called six four is the calculation of heaven. In the subsequent year of Wu Chen, the initial qi begins again at one division. This cycle continues endlessly, revolving and repeating. </p>
<p>(Note: The annotation specifies that in the year of Ding Mao, the initial qi starts at seventy-five divisions of the one thousand ninety-sixth day and ends at below one hundred divisions of water on the one thousand four hundred sixty-first day.)<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>Each year consists of three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five moments. Over four years, it totals one thousand four hundred sixty days, accumulating an extra hundred moments to form an additional day. Each year records a new moon and the empty period by six days, while the weather accumulates five days and twenty-five moments. Among twenty years, the total excess from the weather and new moon counts to two hundred twenty-five days. Thus, there are three years in one cycle, five years in another, and in the ninth decade, there are seven cycles, excluding the three odd days.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to understand how the years and seasons behave!&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Indeed, a keen inquiry! The sun travels a complete cycle and the weather begins at one moment; as the sun travels two cycles, the weather begins at twenty-six moments; after three cycles, it starts at fifty-one moments; after four cycles, it begins at seventy-six moments; and after five cycles, the weather resets to one moment. This is what is called a &#39;cycle of years.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: The previous section discussed the periodicity of the six energies, while this section discusses the energies of a year in relation to the cycles of the heavens.]<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>In a year, the heavens cycle through three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter degree within a day, completing one full turn around the Earth in one day while progressing one degree. Each year comprises three hundred sixty-five days and an additional twenty-five quarts. Thus, in one year, it completes one full turn around the heavens, returning to two cycles. Over four years, this accumulates to a full hundred quarts, forming one record.</p>
<p>Therefore, the years associated with the tiger, horse, and dog share a common energy, as do the years of the rabbit, goat, and pig; the years of the dragon, monkey, and rat; and the years of the snake, rooster, and ox, concluding and beginning anew.</p>
<p>The emperor said, &quot;I wish to understand its application!&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Speaking of heaven is in seeking the origin; speaking of earth is in seeking the position; speaking of humanity is in seeking the interaction of energies.&quot;</p>
<p>Application refers to the movement of yin and yang as they ascend and descend. The origin is based on the six energies of wind, cold, heat, dampness, drought, and fire. The position pertains to the steps of the three yin and three yang. The interaction of energies refers to the convergence of the energies of heaven and earth, the yin and yang, entering and exiting from above and below.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The Emperor asked: What is meant by the exchange of qi? Qi Bo replied: The positions of above and below are where the exchange of qi occurs, which is where humanity resides. Therefore it is said that above the celestial pivot, the heavenly qi governs; below the celestial pivot, the earthly qi governs. The distribution of qi is such that human qi follows it, and all things arise from it. This is what is meant.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What is the initial middle? Qi Bo replied: The initial state is generally thirty degrees and has its peculiarities; the central qi follows the same principles. The Emperor asked: What constitutes the initial middle? Qi Bo replied: It is what divides heaven and earth. The Emperor expressed desire to hear this completely! Qi Bo said: The initial refers to earthly qi, while the middle refers to heavenly qi.</p>
<p>This clarifies the exchange of yin and yang of heaven and earth. Before the half year, heavenly qi governs, and the initial qi of the heavenly is derived from the left of the earth. After the half year, earthly qi governs, and the initial qi of the earthly begins from the right of the heavens. This describes the intersection of above and below. Within one qi, there is also the distinction of initial and middle, including the peculiar. Each governs for thirty days, four hours, seven minutes, and five tenths. The initial qi of the earth, the central qi of the heavens, is within one qi, and thus there is the convergence of the yin and yang of heaven and earth. Hence it is said that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The Emperor said: How do the rise and fall occur? Qibo replied: The rise and fall of qi is the transformation of heaven and earth. The Emperor said: I wish to know how this transformation works. Qibo replied: When it rises, it then falls; the falling is called heaven; when it falls, it then rises; the rising is called earth. The qi of heaven descends, flowing to the earth; the qi of the earth ascends, rising to the heavens. Thus, the high and the low summon each other, the rise and fall are interconnected, and transformation occurs.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Excellent! When cold and damp encounter, when dryness and heat bear upon one another, is there any interval between them? Qibo replied: Qi has phases of dominance and recovery; this phase of dominance and recovery involves virtue and transformation, utility and change; when change occurs, then evil qi resides within it. </p>
<p>This discusses the six qi governing heaven and earth; they have differences in domination, virtue, transformation, and calamity. People also undergo beginnings and endings due to the transformations of yin and yang. Encountering refers to the coming together of the six qi; arriving refers to the six qi&#39;s presence; aligning refers to the direct influence of the six qi through the seasons. Dominance refers to the overwhelming presence, virtue refers to the auspiciousness of qi, utility refers to the movement of essence, change refers to the order of recovery, and evil refers to the changing qi.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The Emperor said: What does that mean? Qi Bo replied: The birth of things arises from transformation, and the extremes of things are due to change. The interaction of change and transformation is where success and failure stem from.</p>
<p>[Note: The Great Treatise on the Five Constants states: Qi begins and gives rise to transformations; Qi ends and manifests change. Therefore, nurturing and collecting are the completion of things, while disasters and alterations are the cause of their downfall. Thus, humans and all things grow within the transformations of yin and yang, and their success and failure depend on these changes.]</p>
<p>Hence, qi has cycles of return, and action has speeds of delay and quickness. These four elements result in transformation and change, leading to the coming of the wind.</p>
<p>[Note: The cycles of return in qi refer to the qi of heaven and earth, having both ascension and descension. The speeds of action refer to the entry and exit of yin and yang, which can be slow or fast. Wind is the movement of qi in heaven and earth, capable of nurturing all things, yet also able to harm them.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The slow and fast return is how the wind is born. Therefore, the reason for transformation and change is due to the fluctuations between prosperity and decline! Why do success and failure fluctuate within?</p>
<p>Qi Bo replied: Success and failure arise from movement; if movement does not cease, transformation occurs.</p>
<p>[Note: Movement refers to the unceasing rise and fall, entry and exit. The success and failure of all things depend on the changes of yin and yang, thus the mechanisms of success and failure lie within these transformations.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Is there a fixed period? Qi Bo replied: Not being born and not transforming is the period of stillness.</p>
<p>[Note: This is like being not born and not transformed, leading to stillness in the end. It refers to the qi of heaven and earth, which is in constant movement.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Is there no birth or transformation?<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Is there a time when there is no birth and transformation?</p>
<p>Qibo said: When in and out is wasted, the divine mechanisms wither away; when rising and falling cease, the vital energy becomes isolated and precarious. This reiterates that the opening and pioneering of heaven and earth involve motion and transformation. &quot;In and out&quot; refers to closing and opening. &quot;Mechanism&quot; is the pivot, and &quot;divine mechanism&quot; refers to the unpredictable changes of Yin and Yang. Just as closing and opening are like doors and shutters, and the pivot is the turning point, without the pivot, there can be no closing or opening; without closing and opening, there is no turning. Thus, when in and out is wasted, the divine mechanisms wither. </p>
<p>Rising and falling refer to the transitions of cold and heat. The rising and falling of Yin and Yang emanate from the earth, while heaven encompasses the earth. Therefore, when rising and falling cease, the external vital energy becomes isolated and precarious; isolation means there is no birth. The &quot;Lower Classic&quot; states: Those rooted in the external are termed vital energy; when energy halts, transformation ceases. Those rooted within are termed divine mechanisms; when the divine departs, the mechanism ceases.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Therefore, without entrance and exit, there can be no growth, maturity, aging, and passing; without rising and falling, there can be no growth, transformation, storage, and collection. Thus, rising and falling, entering and exiting, are present in all things. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Passing&quot; refers to death. &quot;Growth, maturity, aging, and passing&quot; pertains to animals; &quot;growth, transformation, storage, and collection&quot; pertains to plants. All tangible things are called vessels. The relationship between humans and all things arises from the interaction of the energies of heaven and earth. The processes of growth, maturity, aging, and passing depend on the rising and falling and entering and exiting of energies, which is why there is no vessel devoid of these movements.)</p>
<p>Thus, vessels are the universe of transformation. When vessels disperse, the essence of transformation ceases. Therefore, nothing lacks entrance and exit, and nothing lacks rising and falling.</p>
<p>(Note: All tangible things are influenced by the energies of heaven, earth, and the four directions to grow and transform. Thus, vessels represent the universe of transformation. When vessels disperse, the yang returns to heaven and the yin returns to earth, causing transformation to cease. Therefore, all things possess these movements of rising and falling and entering and exiting, which are determined by success and failure.)</p>
<p>Transformation has size, and timing has proximity and distance.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The text discusses the transformation and balance of the forces between heaven and earth, noting distinctions in size and distance. For instance, small creatures like the morning mushroom are unaware of the cycles of day and night, while larger beings like the great mulberry tree experience the seasons over centuries. The forces of heaven (yang) are active, and those of earth (yin) are still; daytime is active while nighttime is still, representing the nearer cyclical changes. The cosmos began at the beginning of the day (zi) and the earth was established in the early hours (chou). The continuous movement of heaven and earth ultimately returns to a state of unity (xu-hai), a more distant transformation, where everything is still and unmoving.</p>
<p>Therefore, maintaining constant principles is of utmost importance; deviation from these will lead to disasters. Thus, it is said that being formless leads to no afflictions; this is a principle to uphold.</p>
<p>As humans exist amidst these forces, it is important to maintain a consistent state; an awareness of potential troubles is crucial, and going against the natural order can invite disasters. Hence, the idea that to transcend earthly forms allows for freedom from worries.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked whether there is a state of existence beyond birth and transformation. Qi Bo replied affirmatively, stating that such a state exists for those who are in harmony with the Dao—these are true individuals. The Emperor acknowledged this as good.</p>
<p>This implies that those who exist between heaven and earth without being constrained by transformation are indeed true individuals. True individuals are those who hold the balance of heaven and earth, mastering the interplay of yin and yang, enduring beyond the decay of the cosmos, and experiencing neither movement nor stillness in unison with heaven and earth.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>The Gate of Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi on the Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grand Theory of Qi Transformation</strong></p>
<p>The Huangdi asked: “The five phases undergo their changes, in alignment with heavenly cycles. Yin and Yang alternate, and the four seasons follow one another. The true and the false influence each other, while the internal and external separate. The six channels fluctuate, and the five energies shift. Excess and deficiency, specialization and amalgamation. I wish to speak of their beginnings, which have constant names. Can this be elucidated?” </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The five phases undergoing change refers to the succession of the five phases in their cyclical influences. Alignment with heavenly cycles means each phase governs three hundred sixty-five days, corresponding to the heavenly measure. The alternation of Yin and Yang indicates their excess leading to departure or deficiency following. The true and false influencing one another suggest auspicious transformations and changing energies. The six channels refer to the three Yin and three Yang channels, and the five energies pertain to the Qi of the five organs. Specialization and amalgamation refer to those years of excess and deficiency; the energy that is overcome is specialized, and excess is then amalgamated.]</strong><a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The beginning, the heavenly qi starts with Jia, the earthly qi starts with Zi, the conjunction of Zi and Jia gives rise to the operation of the year. Qi Bo bowed his head in reverence and replied: &quot;Indeed, it is clear, I ask! This is the luminous Dao. This is what the Supreme Deity values, transmitted by the ancient masters. Though I am not talented, I have heard its purpose.&quot; </p>
<p>The emperor said: &quot;I have heard that if one obtains a person but does not teach them, it is called losing the Dao; if one transmits to an unworthy person, it is a slow leaking of heavenly treasures. I am indeed lacking in virtue, insufficient to receive the ultimate Dao. However, the multitude grieves for its incompleteness, wishing that you may preserve it infinitely and flow into the boundless. If I were to manage this matter, what should I do?&quot; </p>
<p>Qi Bo said: &quot;Please allow me to continue my explanation.&quot;<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>The &quot;Upper Canon&quot; states: The Way is such that it knows the celestial phenomena above, understands the geography of the earth below, and comprehends human affairs in the middle; it can be eternal and enduring. This is what is meant. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What does this mean? Qi Bo replied: The root is the position of Qi. The position of heaven pertains to celestial phenomena. The position of earth pertains to geography. Understanding the changes in human Qi relates to human affairs. Therefore, the excessive pertains to the former heaven, while the insufficient pertains to the latter heaven. What is meant by governing and transforming is that people respond to it.</p>
<p>Note: The position of Qi refers to the Five Movements and Six Qi, each governing the positioning of heaven and the marking of earth, determining the seasons and timing. The position of heaven is the manifestation of the heavens. The position of earth corresponds to the six seasonal phases. Humans dwell in the intersection of the Qi of heaven and earth, adapting to the changes of yin and yang across the four seasons, which pertains to human affairs.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Therefore, when the forces of fate are excessive, the atmospheric influences of the four seasons arrive ahead of their natural time; conversely, when the forces of fate are insufficient, the atmospheric influences of the four seasons arrive later than their natural time. This describes the changes brought about by the influences of the year, to which people must respond. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What happens when the transformation of the five influences is excessive?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;When the Wood of the year is excessive, the winds are rampant, and the Earth of the Spleen suffers from evil influences. The people experience symptoms like loose stools, reduced appetite, a heavy and discomforted body, rumbling intestines, and abdominal distension. This corresponds to the Year Star.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: When the Wood of the year is excessive, it overcomes the Earth influences, causing illnesses related to the Spleen. Loose stools, reduced appetite, rumbling intestines, and abdominal fullness are all disorders of the Spleen. The Spleen governs the muscles and limbs, hence the feeling of heaviness and discomfort arises, as Earth is damaged and cannot control Water, allowing Water&#39;s influences to rise and affect the Heart. This corresponds to the Year Star, which is greatly luminous. The Year Star refers to Jupiter. Thus, too much Wood influence corresponds to certain years.) </p>
<p>In severe cases, one may feel sudden anger, and could experience dizziness, headache, or a sense of imbalance.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The excess of indulgence leads to self-harm. A good anger is a disease of the liver and will. The Jueyin and Du meridians meet at the top of the head, hence the dizziness and headaches. If the transformation of qi does not regulate, the vital energy acts alone, causing the clouds and objects to fly, and the plants and trees to be unsettled; excessively, they may even shake and fall, leading to side pain and severe vomiting. If the Chongyang is cut off, there is no hope of recovery. It also corresponds to the planet Tai Bai.</p>
<p>The transformation of qi refers to the energy of the earth. Excessive wind and wood cause the transformation of qi to fail in establishing its governance. The vital energy refers to the wood&#39;s energy. When the wind is dominant, it moves; hence the clouds and objects above are flying, and the plants and trees below are unsettled. The side pain and severe vomiting happen when indulgence reaches its peak, leading to injury. When the nourishing energy of food enters the stomach, it spreads its essence to the liver. When the liver qi is weak and reverses, it results in severe vomiting. The Chongyang refers to the stomach meridian.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The wood has thrived and the earth&#39;s energy has been depleted; thus it serves as evidence of a death that cannot be treated. It corresponds to the Venus star, which is the bright star of Venus. When the year’s energies are excessive and the star loses its brightness, it affects its mother as well. If wood is too abundant in the year, then the stabilizing star loses its brightness, and even the fiery planet Mars becomes dim. When Mars loses its brilliance, the Venus shines and thus overcomes the wood. This mutual interaction and regulation is the way of nature.</p>
<p>In a year where fire is excessive, scorching heat prevails, leading to pathogenic influences on the metallic lungs. The people suffer from fevers, reduced vitality, coughing and wheezing, bleeding, severe diarrhea, dry throats, deafness, internal heat, and discomfort in the shoulders and back. This corresponds to the planetary influence of Mars.</p>
<p>Note: Fire dominates and thus overcomes metal, which is why the metallic lungs are affected. Malaria and fevers are heat-related illnesses. Intense fire consumes energy, hence the low vitality. The lungs suffer from excessive heat, resulting in coughing and wheezing.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The lungs govern the hundred vessels; when the yang vessels are harmed, blood overflows above; when the yin vessels are harmed, blood leaks below. The lungs are the source of water. If the throat is dry, it is due to fire&#39;s scorching. The kidneys open to the ears; when the source of water is exhausted, the kidneys become deficient, leading to deafness. Internal heat indicates excessive heat within. The shoulders and back correspond to the lungs. The Blazing Star is the planet associated with fire. When fire energy is dominant, it corresponds above to the Blazing Star, its light becoming much greater. When fire is overactive, it affects all the Wus.</p>
<p>If this condition becomes severe, it can lead to chest pain, fullness in the ribs, rib pain, pain between the chest and shoulder blades, inner arm pain, body heat, and bone pain, resulting in accumulation. </p>
<p>(Note: This extreme condition harms the heart&#39;s fire. The chest is the palace of the heart. The back is yang, while the heart is the sun among the yang, hence the pain in the chest, back, and between the shoulder blades.)<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>The Hand Shaoyin Heart Meridian emerges beneath the ribcage, following the inner arm down to the elbow, then along the inner back of the arm. Thus, one experiences fullness and pain in the sides, pain in both inner arms, and symptoms of body heat and bone pain, indicating excess fire and damage to water. Soaking and immersion lead to fiery heat sores. The path of the organ&#39;s energy states that heart disease causes pain in the chest, fullness in the sides, pain beneath the ribs, pain between the eagle&#39;s back and shoulder blades, and pain in both inner arms. The &quot;Jinkui Yaolue&quot; states that sores from immersion that flow from the mouth to the limbs can be treated; those that flow from the limbs back to the mouth cannot be treated. </p>
<p>If energy is not circulating, and yang energy is solely bright, it brings rain, water, and frost chill. This corresponds to the Zen Star. </p>
<p>[Note: Here, the golden energy is stagnant while the water energy is replenished. Gathering energy represents golden energy. Lengthening energy represents fiery energy. Rain, water, and frost chill represent the resurgence of cold water energy. The correspondence to the Zen Star indicates brightness, with the Zen Star being Mercury.]<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>When the upper forces are influenced by the Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang, the fire burns fiercely, the water springs dry up, and all things become scorched and withered. </p>
<p>(Note: The &#39;upper forces&#39; refer to the celestial energy governing the year&#39;s fortunes, known as the &#39;heavenly sign of the year.&#39; In the years of Wuzi and Wuwu, the Lesser Yin prevails; in the years of Wuyin and Wushen, the Lesser Yang prevails. When the celestial influences align with the year&#39;s fortunes, the fire energy intensifies, causing the water springs to dry and nature to wither. It is noted that among the years governed by Yang, only Wuzi, Wuwu, Wuyin, Wushen, Bingchen, and Bingxu have this celestial influence aligning with the year&#39;s fortunes; other years associated with wood, metal, and earth do not have this alignment.)</p>
<p>In cases of reversal, there are delirium and madness, dry cough, wheezing, and continuous severe bleeding and diarrhea. If the Taiyuan pulse is absent, it is an indication of death without treatment. This corresponds to the influence of the comet.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>In the text, it discusses various conditions and their symptoms. It explains that a severe fire condition can lead to self-harm, resulting in madness or delirium, showcasing extreme heat symptoms. Coughing and wheezing indicate an upward blaze that affects the metal element. The heart governs blood vessels, and excessive downward flow causes continuous blood loss. Taiyuan is the acupoint associated with lung metal. When fire is too intense and metal energy is depleted, it signifies an incurable death sign. This corresponds to the appearance of the comet, whose luminosity is magnified and represents the fire star.</p>
<p>When the year&#39;s earth is excessive, causing dampness and disease spread, the kidney water is affected, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, illness, a lack of joy, and oppressive heaviness. This aligns with the star associated with weather stability.</p>
<p>The notes clarify that earth pertains to the ground while moisture pertains to the sky; thus, excessive earth leads to damp rain. The &quot;Six Elements and Proper Timing&quot; states that the location of the moon results in clouds and rain, indicating the rise of humid earth energy as it transforms into clouds and rain.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Abdominal pain refers to pain in the lower and upper abdomen, indicating a kidney-related illness, where dominance and water cause harm. The method of assessing internal energy states states: when suffering from kidney disease, the body feels heavy; when the kidneys are deficient, there is pain in the upper and lower abdomen. The kidneys are the source of life energy; when kidney energy is affected by pathogens, it leads to coldness in the hands and feet. If the will is not settled, it results in a lack of joy. Human actions rely on energy and blood circulation. The kidneys are the source of blood and energy; when the body feels heavy and burdened, water cannot support fire. If the earth element is excessive, its influence will increase in brightness. The star of influence refers to Saturn. An excess of earth energy affects all yearly cycles.</p>
<p>In severe cases, muscles may atrophy, feet may weaken and retract, movement becomes difficult, there is pain in the feet, shallow breathing, fullness in the stomach, decreased appetite, limbs become immobile, and transformations in position occur.</p>
<p>(Note: Muscles and limbs are under the dominion of the spleen, which is associated with the earth element.)<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>Drinking leads to an inability to transform the qi, resulting in phlegm and water retention. When there is fullness and reduced food intake, the individual becomes weak and cannot handle transformations. If this excess becomes too extreme, it will overturn the original state and cause self-harm. Therefore, on the eighteenth day of the fourth month of the season, when the earth qi is at its proper place, this illness arises.</p>
<p>Storing energy suppresses water qi, while transforming qi uniquely treats it. Springs gush and rivers flow, drying up marshes produces fish. When strong winds and heavy rains occur, the earth collapses, and scales appear on land. Symptoms of bloated abdomen, diarrhea, and intestinal sounds indicate severe descent and exhaustion of the Tai Xi, leading to untreatable death. This corresponds to the year star.</p>
<p>Note: Storing energy refers to water qi. Transforming qi refers to earth qi. When earth is strong, it controls water, hence the storage of energy is suppressed. The gushing springs and flowing rivers indicate excessive humidity. Strong winds and heavy rains signify the return of wood qi. The collapse of the earth and the appearance of scales on land show the failure of earth and overflow of water.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>Bloating, diarrhea, and intestinal rumbling indicate a deficiency in the spleen&#39;s earth element. Tai Xi corresponds to the kidney meridian. If one excessively purges and the Tai Xi pulse disappears, the earth fails and the water fluxes downward excessively. When there is a serious overflow of water, the kidney qi is depleted. This corresponds to the brilliance of the year star (Jupiter), indicating the dominance of wood.</p>
<p>When there is an excess of metal this year, dry energy circulates, affecting the liver wood. The people suffer from pain in the lower ribs and lower abdomen, red eyes, eye sores, and hearing loss. When the suppression is severe, the body feels heavy and troubled, the chest is painful and radiates to the back, and there is fullness and pain in the lower ribs that radiates to the lower abdomen. This corresponds to the Tai Bai star (Venus).</p>
<p>Note: When there is an excess of metal this year and dry energy flows, the liver wood is affected. Pain in the lower ribs and lower abdomen indicates liver disease. The liver opens to the eyes, hence the eye pain and sores; if the liver is deficient, there is hearing loss.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>Those who are heavy in weight experience a deadly chill, lacking any vibrant life force. Those troubled by grievances have their liver qi counterflowing and unable to relax. The Classic text states: Kidney deficiency, spleen deficiency, and liver deficiency all lead to a heavy and troubled body. The Treatise on the True Organs of the Jade Mechanism states: If the liver meridian is deficient, it causes pain in the chest that radiates to the back, and fullness in the sides. Tai Bai refers to the planet Venus. When the metal energy prevails, it corresponds upwards to the brightness of Tai Bai. When the metal influence is excessive, it leads to years categorized by the metal element. When it becomes extreme, it results in wheezing, coughing, counterflowing qi, shoulder and back pain, and illness in the lower body including the thighs, knees, and feet. This corresponds to the star of the comet. </p>
<p>Note: An excessive chill can lead to a deficiency in metal energy and a resurgence of fire energy. Wheezing and coughing indicate lung disease. The lung shu points are located on the shoulders and back, hence the shoulder and back pain. Illness in the lower body occurs when metal energy is deficient, affecting the water organs derived from it.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The excessive indulgence of metal leads to a depletion of its foundational essence; when metal is depleted, it cannot generate water, which allows fire to gain strength and flourish. Thus, there is an astrological correspondence with the brightening of the comet. </p>
<p>When energy is gathered and heightened, vitality descends; plants and trees wither, turning yellow and falling. Illness returns with violent pain, and the sides are restricted, making it impossible to turn. Severe cough leads to significant bleeding. When the Great Surge is obstructed, death is inevitable and cannot be treated. This corresponds above to the star Venus.</p>
<p>(Note: The explanation clarifies that &quot;gathering energy&quot; refers to the energy of metal, while &quot;vitality&quot; refers to the energy of wood. The gathering of metal energy and the suppression of wood vitality cause plants to wither. Violent pain and restriction of the sides indicate liver and gallbladder ailments, as the liver meridian passes through the lungs, resulting in severe cough; the liver&#39;s function of storing blood explains the bleeding as well. The Great Surge is the meridian of the liver, and strong metal energy corresponds above to the brightness of Venus.)<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>In this year, excessive water has led to a prevalence of cold air. The邪 (pathogenic factors) affects the heart fire, causing the people to suffer from symptoms such as fever, irritability, restlessness, cold limbs, general coldness, delirium, and heart pain, indicating the arrival of cold air early. This is reflected in the celestial bodies, specifically the star Chen.</p>
<p>(Note: The explanation describes how excessive water leads to flowing cold air, thereby harming the heart’s fire. The cold air overpowers the fire, resulting in symptoms like fever and irritability. Heart palpitations are caused by water vapor affecting the heart. Restlessness arises when fire energy does not harmonize with yin energy. The extreme cold causes cold limbs, and a decline in the fire of the Triple Burners leads to general coldness and mental unrest, manifesting as delirium. Cold is associated with winter, hence the early arrival of cold air in this year&#39;s climate, which correlates with the star Chen, representing water. The excessive water causes the star Chen to shine more brightly. When water is overly excessive, it relates to the years particularly abundant in fire.) </p>
<p>In severe cases, symptoms can include abdominal distension, swollen limbs, wheezing cough, night sweats, aversion to wind, heavy rain, and a thick haze.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>The above corresponds with the Zheng Star. [Note: This water is excessively indulgent and harmful to oneself. The theory of the viscera states that a kidney disease results in a large abdomen, swollen legs, coughing, sweating at night, and aversion to wind. This is because the water evil overflows, and when the earth cannot control it, there is a large abdomen and swollen legs; when the water qi rises, there is coughing. The sun&#39;s qi is birthed in the water and rules the surface; if the water overflows, the source dries up, and the sun&#39;s qi has no means of sustenance. The exterior yang is deficient, hence sweating and aversion to wind. When heavy rain arrives, dust and mist become thick, indicating that the water is indulgent yet the earth’s qi recovers. The Six Elements Discussion states: where the Taiyin reaches, dampness arises, ultimately leading to rainfall. The thick mist indicates that the earthy damp qi is rising. With the earth&#39;s qi restored, the Zheng Star shines even brighter.] When the sun is above, rain, ice, snow, and frost fall irregularly, causing humidity to transform things. This results in reverse symptoms of abdominal fullness, intestinal sounds, diarrhea, undigested food, and thirst leading to bizarre behavior. If the Shenmen is extinguished, there is no cure for death. Above it also corresponds with the Yinghuo and Chen Stars. [Note: The one above the sun indicates that the cold water governs the atmospheric qi, adding to its presence above, namely in the years of Bingchen and Bingxu, which are the years of the heavenly sign. The mingling of cold water is why rain, ice, snow, and frost fall irregularly. Ice represents the variability of cold water. When rain descends, the earth becomes damp and things transform. The ailments of abdominal fullness, intestinal sounds, diarrhea, and undigested food are all proofs of the water overflowing and the earth succumbing. The spleen cannot transport its fluids, hence the thirst. The humidity appears prominently, hence the strange behavior. Shenmen refers to the heart channel. The water qi is exceedingly strong, leading to a dimming of the Yinghuo and a brighter Chen Star.]<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>The emperor said: &quot;Good! What if it does not suffice?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;It is important to inquire! When the year&#39;s wood fails, the dry air prevails, the vital energy loses its response, and grass and trees flourish late. When the chill and killing energy is excessive, even the sturdy wood suffers damage, while the soft and wilted become pale and dry. This corresponds to the appearance of the Tai Bai star.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: When the year&#39;s energy is insufficient, what one cannot overcome is insulted and exploited. Thus, the main influence of the year&#39;s wood is inadequate, and the dry energy of metal prevails, causing the vital energy of wood to lose its timing and response, resulting in late flourishing of grass and trees. The excessive chill and killing atmosphere affect even the hard and strong wood, which suffers harm; the soft and wilted become pale and dry. The metal energy dominates, leading to the appearance of the brighter Tai Bai star. The wood influence is insufficient, resulting in the Year of the Six Ding.] The people suffer from internal heat, experiencing pain in the ribs and sides, lower abdominal pain, rumbling intestines, and diarrhea, with cool rain arriving timely. This also corresponds to the appearance of the Tai Bai star. Its grains are pale.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Note: The &quot;Middle Clear&quot; refers to the coolness of the air residing within, resulting in a cool internal energy. Pain in the sides and lower abdomen is associated with liver wood disorders. The food energy enters the stomach, dispersing essence in the liver and circulating energy in the tendons. When the liver energy is deficient and rebellious, combined with the Middle Clear, it leads to rumbling in the intestines and diarrhea. The metal energy is cool, hence the arrival of cool rain; metal can generate water. When the metal energy prevails, it corresponds above to Venus, whose brilliance is magnified. The five grains receive the energies of the five elements from the earth, growing, transforming, and storing nutrients. Wood is controlled by metal, thus the grains appear bluish-green.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When Yangming rises, the vital energy loses its regulation; grasses and trees flourish once more, and the transformation of energy becomes urgent. It also corresponds above to Venus, the stabilizing star. Its influence is early and flourishing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: Yangming, being dry metal, rises above in the control of the heavens, represented by the years of Ding Yin and Ding You, known as the years of heavenly punishment. The wood of the year is insufficient, combined with the presence of metal energy above, thus leading to the loss of the wood&#39;s vital energy regulation.</strong><a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The grass and trees receive the punishment of metal and thus flourish again. If the wood is insufficient, it cannot control the earth; hence, the transformation of energy becomes urgent. The energy of metal and earth prevails, corresponding to Venus, the bright star. The wood succumbs to the control of metal, hence it governs the azure hue appearing early, and when it is controlled, it embodies the principle of transformation and vitality.</p>
<p>In all the yin years, the influence is not sufficient; thus, there are only the years of Ding Mao, Ding You, Ji Si, Ji Hai, Xin Chou, and Xin Wei. In those years of Gui and Yi, there is no superior conjunction of heaven.</p>
<p>As for the revival, it is the mother of the bulging offspring. The flowing fire refers to the great fire descending. At the turn of summer and autumn, the great fire flows westward, scorching the metal with heat. The long summer, where the wet earth dominates energy, results in damp conditions turning dry due to the summer heat, causing all things to become soft and brittle, leading to withered grass and trees. The lower body regenerates, and blossoms and fruits transform simultaneously. Diseases of cold and heat—sores, rashes, abscesses—occur. This corresponds to the wandering star (Mars) and Venus above, while the grains are firm and white.</p>
<p>(Note: Revival refers to the mother’s accumulated energy. Flowing fire indicates the great fire pouring downward. At the transition between summer and autumn, the great fire flows westward, scorching the metal. The long summer, ruled by damp earth, becomes hot and dry, making all things brittle and leading to withered vegetation. Fire governs the long energy, thus the lower body regenerates. Summer is the season of blossoms, while autumn signifies maturity; therefore, fire controls metal, allowing blossoms and fruits to transform together. Cold and heat afflictions are all illnesses caused by summer heat. This corresponds to Mars shining brightly above and Venus dimming its brightness. The grains are white and firm, reflecting the autumn&#39;s harvest, thus they mature early.) </p>
<p>With the early arrival of White Dew, the harvest killing energy manifests. Cold rain harms the crops, and insects feast on the sweet, yellow plants. The spleen earth suffers from evil influences, the red aura transforms afterwards, and heart energy treats late. The influence above overcomes the lung metal, resulting in the white energy being subdued, and thus the grains do not mature. Coughing and sneezing occur. This corresponds to Venus and the bright star above.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>This discussion occurs in the year influenced by Yangming, where the metal energy is prominent, resulting in an early arrival of White Dew at the transition from summer to autumn, and the lethal energy is activated while fire remains subdued. In years lacking this influence, the prevailing energies act recklessly, causing self-weakening in their positions, allowing the rebalancing energies to prevail. Now, under Yangming’s influence, the metal energy is indeed strong. When metal energy is strong, its offspring energy can also prevail; thus, the offspring of fire and wood wish to regain their influence, but the offspring of metal can counter them, leading to subsequent transformations in red energy. Cold rain, the essence of cold water, is the energy of metal’s offspring. Following the prolonged energies, the command to store early acts, therefore causing harm to all things, which disrupts the growth of grains. Insects respond to the humid air of rain and thrive, yet at the transition from summer to autumn, the earth energy is in action but overpowered by the cold rain, resulting in insects consuming sweet and ripe crops. The spleen’s earth element is affected by this malevolent force, leading to symptoms in the lungs and nasal passages, hence causing coughs and clear nasal discharge.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>When the comet appears, it revives its brilliance, while Venus dims its light. In years when fire is not sufficient, cold prevails, and long governance is ineffective. The things below flourish but are repressed; when cold is severe, the vital energy does not transform, and thus beauty withers. This corresponds with the appearance of the constellations.</p>
<p>(Note: The lines explain that in a year where fire is weak, water dominates, leading to pervasive cold and ineffective governance. All beings require vital energy to flourish, but when the cold prevails, this energy is suppressed, hindering growth and vitality.)<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>The people suffer from internal pain in the chest, fullness in the sides, pain in both flanks, and discomfort between the shoulder blades and in both inner arms. There is vexation and obscurity, and sudden heart pain causing muteness. The chest and abdomen are distended, with pain radiating from the flanks to the lower back, making it difficult to bend or extend, as if the hips and thighs are separated. This corresponds to the stars of Mercury and the celestial dragon. </p>
<p>[Note: When the fire element is insufficient, cold prevails, preventing yang energy from transforming, resulting in various pains. The phrase &#39;cold prevailing leads to painful obstruction&#39; reflects this. Vexation and obscurity represent the invasion of cold and dampness. The chill from the water affects the heart, hence the heart pain. The heart&#39;s association with speech leads to sudden muteness. The Taiyang (Sun) governs all yang energies that arise amidst cold water; excessive cold leads to a deficiency of yang. The inability to bend or extend indicates that the problem resides in the tendons, as Taiyang governs the tendons, and the deficiency of yang energy cannot nourish them.]<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The illness caused by solar energy manifests as a sensation of the waist being broken, the thigh unable to bend, a knotting in the back of the knee, and a feeling of cracking in the ankle, which is known as ankle deficiency. This corresponds with the dimming of the Red Planet and the increased brightness of the star of the morning. Fire is constrained, hence the grain and dye are affected.</p>
<p>If it recurs, dust and gloom will accumulate, heavy rain is imminent, and black air will desecrate. Symptoms include excessive drooling, a bloated abdomen, inability to eat or drink, cold sensations, rumbling in the intestines, diarrhea, abdominal pain, violent cramps, weakness, and the feet unable to support the body. This corresponds with the restraint of the stars. The original grain cannot be formed.</p>
<p>(Note: The text refers to excessive water and the recovery of earth energy, where the accumulated dust steams upward, leading to imminent heavy rain. The energy of the earth rises and manifests as clouds and rain. According to the Six Elements’ Key Concepts, the moisture associated with the moon ultimately leads to rain. The black air represents the water energy, while the term &quot;desecrate&quot; indicates the lower position of earth energy recovering and water energy being subdued.)<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The ducks are full but unable to move, indicating signs of cold and dampness. It is due to excessive cold water, compounded by wet soil, that these ailments arise. This corresponds to the brightening of the northern star and the dimming of the dawn star. The cold and dampness oppose each other, and without the transformation of dryness and heat, the essence of life cannot come to fruition.</p>
<p>If the earth is insufficient, the wind will then greatly circulate, and the vital energy will not direct its course. The grass and trees flourish abundantly, swaying excessively, becoming lush but lacking substance. This aligns with the position of the annual star.</p>
<p>Note: When the earth&#39;s energy is lacking, wood prevails, hence the strong winds arise, while the transforming energy of the earth cannot establish its governance. Wind nurtures growth, while the earth solidifies existence, thus the grass and trees may be lush but often do not yield fruit. This reflects the increased radiance of the annual star in a year when the earth&#39;s energy falls short, specifically during the sixth year of the cycle.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>When the people suffer from food poisoning, cholera, weight issues, abdominal pain, throbbing in the muscles and bones, they become irritable, maintaining pent-up energy and taking action. Insects that hibernate appear early, and they are generally sick from the cold within. This corresponds to the year star and the town star. Their grains are infested.</p>
<p>[Note: Food poisoning, cholera, weight issues, abdominal pain, and muscle throbbing are all illnesses caused by the excess of wind and wood injuring the earth. The movement of the muscles and bones indicates diseases of the Jueyin and Shaoyang. Excess wind and wood cause the muscles and bones to tremble and irritability to arise. If the earth&#39;s energy is inadequate, wood has no restraint, hence the pent-up energy leads to action, and hibernating insects attach early. Those sick from cold within are affected by cold water, while fire and earth are weakened. This corresponds to the increased brightness of the year star and the diminished color of the town star. The earth is subjected, hence the infestation of their grains.]</p>
<p>When recovery occurs, governance becomes strict. The wood is dark and sculpted, causing pain in the chest and flanks, radiating down to the lower abdomen, leading to deep sighing. Insects consume sweetness, and yellow energy settles in the spleen, resulting in a reduction of infested grains, leading to less flavorful food and a decline in the quality of grain.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The above corresponds to the White Star and the Year Star. </p>
<p>[Note: The earth is weak and the wood is excessive; therefore, metal restores it, leading to strict governance, and is named &#39;the dark wood carving.&#39; Symptoms include pain in the chest and sides that radiates down to the lower abdomen, which is due to liver wood illness. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: Those with gallbladder issues sigh frequently. This is because wood stagnates, causing the gallbladder energy to be unrelaxed, hence the sighing as a means to release it. Insects are affected by cold and dampness, feeding on the sweet yellow energy trapped in the spleen, which in turn causes water to invade the earth. Thus, when the earth fails to circulate properly, the stored energy is mobilized, and although metal restores it, the offspring also follow this. When metal energy is restored, the dark valley is damaged. When water energy prevails, the dark valley diminishes, leading the people to have less and less flavorful food. The above corresponds to the White Star increasing its brightness.] </p>
<p>Looking up to the Jue Yin, the flowing waters do not freeze, and the hibernating insects come forth. If the stored energy is not utilized, the white does not restore. Looking up to the Year Star, the people will prosper.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> In the upper realm is the element of Jueyin, corresponding to the years of Ji-Si and Ji-Hai. When Jueyin is above, Shaoyang is below; hence, flowing water does not freeze, and hibernating insects do not hide. When the qi is stored but not used, it is said to be below the midpoint of the year, gaining the fire of Shaoyang, resulting in a winter that is not cold. Even if the wood of the year does not seek its virtue, it still overcomes and uses the earth. However, when Jueyin governs the heavens, the wood qi is not empty, hence the white (referring to frost) does not return. In the upper realm corresponds with the year star increasing its brightness. It is noted that the winning qi is predominant before the midpoint of the year, while the recovering qi prevails after. During autumn and winter, the wood qi has equalized, and the gold qi does not return; therefore, the people can attain health. One must understand that the winning qi acting recklessly damages its original position, leaving both child and mother devoid; thus, the recovering qi is able to restore. If the original qi is not empty, then the child qi is also substantial, and the recovering qi fears its child and does not dare to restore.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The year of metal does not prevail; the fiery energies arise. Vital forces are in use, with long-lasting energies dominating. All things flourish, and the dryness shines forth. It corresponds to the planet Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the metal influence is weak, the fire energies prevail. Metal cannot control wood, hence the life force of wood is utilized. The dominance of the long-lasting fire energies leads to vigorous growth, hence all things flourish. The fiery energies prevail, causing dryness to shine forth. It corresponds to Mars, whose brightness is significantly enhanced. The year of metal does not prevail; it is the Year of the Six Yi.</p>
<p>People suffer from shoulder and back pain, and nasal congestion; blood flows downwards, the vital forces are collected afterwards. It corresponds to the planet Venus, for its grains are hard and sharp.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lungs are associated with the shoulders and back, hence people suffer from these pains. The low pressure at the head is referred to as nasal congestion. The meridian texts say: the lungs cause movement, leading to pain in the lower abdomen, and in severe cases, it could lead one to grasp at their hands in distress.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Sneezing indicates lung diseases. Blood in stool indicates that fire is forcing blood downwards. When metal is restrained, it collects energy until autumn is deep, and only then does it move. This corresponds to the pale appearance of Venus. When energy gathers, grains afterwards become coarse and substantial.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, cold rain arrives, leading to sleet, hail, frost, and snow, which kills living things. Yin grows constricted, and yang reverses and ascends, causing pain in the head and temples, extending to heat at the crown. This corresponds to the star Chen.</p>
<p>When the red valley does not form, people suffer from mouth ulcers, and severe cases lead to heart pain. </p>
<p>(Note: When metal is weak and fire is excessive, water then returns, thus the sudden cold rain. The subsequent sleet kills living things, representing the transformation of cold water. In autumn and winter, yang energy should be stored in the yin organs. The constricting cold air reverses and presses against yang outside, causing it to ascend, resulting in pain in the head and warmth at the crown, which corresponds to the brighter star Chen. Water exceeds its long energy, thus the red valley does not form. The cold energy of water ascends, forcing the heart&#39;s fire to flare outward, hence people suffer from mouth ulcers, and in severe cases, heart pain.)</p>
<p>In years when water is insufficient, humidity prevails, the long energy is counterproductive, and transformations occur rapidly, with frequent summer rains. This corresponds to the star Zhen.</p>
<p>(Note: When the water flow is insufficient, earth prevails, hence the great spread of humidity. The weakness of water cannot restrain fire, resulting in the long energy being counterproductive. When fire and earth combine, the transformation of earth&#39;s energy is rapid, thus summer rains occur frequently. The records of the six elements state that wherever the Taiyin reaches, it causes transformation into clouds and rain. This corresponds to the brighter star Zhen. When water flow is insufficient, it is a year of the six Xins.)<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>The people suffer from symptoms such as abdominal fullness, a heavy body, diarrhea, cold sores, excessive fluid, pain in the lower back and thighs, difficulty in the knees and legs, restlessness, foot weakness, coldness in the feet, and severe cases leading to swelling in the ankles. The stored energy is in disarray, and the kidney energy is unbalanced. This corresponds to the planet of the morning star. The grain is glutinous millet.</p>
<p>(Note: Excessive damp earth injures the kidney yin, resulting in these ailments. The &quot;Classic of Suwen&quot; states that excess yang energy can lead to insufficient nourishment, resulting in boils. When yin and yang do not communicate and the two heats clash, it leads to pus formation. Additionally, it states that when cold evil invades the meridians and cannot be expelled, it results in boils. This indicates cold poison without heat transformation, hence the occurrence of cold sores, with fluid but no pus. The cold energy rising causes restlessness. The water&#39;s stored energy cannot manifest its directives, and the kidney energy, related to the water organ, cannot be balanced. This also corresponds to the morning star losing its brightness. Glutinous millet, being black millet, gains its moisture from the earth, leading to the formation of glutinous grain.)<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>When the upper celestial body aligns with the Moon, there are frequent occurrences of extreme cold, and hibernating insects have already hidden away. The ground accumulates solid ice, and sunlight fails to provide warmth. As a result, the people suffer from cold diseases below; in severe cases, they experience abdominal distension and swelling. This corresponds with the Zhuan star, presiding over the valley grains.</p>
<p>(Note: The commentary explains that the heavenly energy, when aligned with the Moon, indicates the years of Xin Chou and Xin Wei. The Moon, representing damp earth in the heavens, leads to the cold water of the Sun in the springs, which causes the extreme cold to occur frequently, and hibernating insects to hide away. Due to the persistent cold, sunlight fails to warm above, and the cold water in the springs causes the people below to suffer from diseases; in severe cases, abdominal swelling and distension occur due to excessive dampness injuring the earth element of the spleen. The celestial alignment corresponds with the Zhuan star shining brightly above and indicates the successful harvest in the valley below.)<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>When strong winds arise, the grass bends and trees fall, growth becomes lacking in vitality, and the complexion changes frequently. The muscles and bones are affected, causing shivers and trembling, with vision unclear. Things become sparse and break, and the flesh develops rashes. The energy is trapped in the diaphragm, causing pain in the heart and abdomen, and the yellow energy diminishes, leading to poor harvests. This corresponds to the year star.</p>
<p>The notes explain that water is weak and earth prevails, so the intense winds arise, causing the grass to droop and trees to drop, hence the lack of vibrant growth. The Yangming element, associated with earth, controls the face, resulting in the complexion changing frequently. Yangming regulates the muscles and tendons, which are all connected to the bones; thus, when the earth energy is harmed, the muscles and bones are affected too. The shivers and trembles refer to sudden movements. When vision is unclear, it indicates that the eyes are impaired due to the winds damaging the blood. When things break due to wind, it is described as splitting. Rashes occur when wind enters the diaphragm; it causes pain above in the heart and below in the abdomen. Earth governs the formation of things, and its energy being harmed results in poor harvests. The phenomenon corresponds to the year star, which shines more brightly.</p>
<p>The emperor said: &quot;Good! I wish to hear about the timing!&quot;<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>The notes explain that the four seasons correspond to the victory and recovery of the five movements. The &quot;True Discussion&quot; states: at the beginning of the qi, with the arrival of the three qi, the heavenly qi governs it, exemplifying its victory; at the end of the four qi, the earthly qi governs it, exemplifying its recovery. The five movements govern the years, with the victorious qi before the midpoint of the year and the recovering qi after it. In the case of the victories and recoveries of the four seasons, they follow the governing times for victory and also follow the governing times for recovery, which is different from the yearly movement.</p>
<p>Qibo then says: Indeed, what a question! If wood does not flourish, then metal should overcome it; just as in spring, if there are harmonious transformations, then in autumn there will be clear and cool mists and dews. If in spring there is a severe and destructive victory, then in summer there will be the scorching heat of recovery. The afflictions arise from the east, and affect the liver internally, with illness manifesting externally in the joints.</p>
<p>The notes clarify that if wood does not flourish, then metal should overcome it; just as when spring has the harmony of transformation, autumn will have the governance of cool mists and dews. These each fulfill their rightful place in the four seasons, without victory or recovery, exemplifying the harmony of qi. If spring has a severe and destructive victory, then summer will have the intense heat of recovery.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>The disasters and misfortune are governed by the East, with the liver as the organ involved. The illnesses manifest in internal places such as the ribs, which are related to the liver. Externally, issues arise in the joints, as the liver governs the tendons. The same applies to the other four seasons.</p>
<p>When fire is insufficient, summer shows bright and apparent transformations, while winter has a serious and frigid governance. Summer may face grim and chilling victories, leading to seasonal disturbances with fog and heavy rains. The disasters occur in the South, with the heart as the governing organ. The diseases affect the internal spaces of the chest and ribs, while externally, they affect the meridians, as the heart governs the blood vessels.</p>
<p>When earth is insufficient, the four directions bring forth cloudy and moist transformations, thus spring has policies that stimulate the growth of plants. The four directions also vibrate and sway, leading to autumn&#39;s harsh kill and heavy rains. The disasters loom over the four directions, with the spleen as the organ affected. The sicknesses concern the internal areas of the abdomen, while externally, they affect the muscles and limbs.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>The notes explain that the moistening of the earth is the virtue of soil transformation, and the sounding of drums represents the regulations of wood. The peace of this atmosphere means there is no overpowering force. The resonance and the floating movement indicate that wood dominates over soil. The cooling and heavy rains signify the return of autumn’s golden qualities. The earth governs the four seasons, hence it&#39;s referred to as the four dimensions and as out of season. </p>
<p>The heart is related to the stomach, while the abdomen pertains to the spleen and soil. </p>
<p>When metal is lacking, summer’s radiant and oppressive regulations lead to winter’s severe and orderly responses; summer’s fiery transformations result in autumn’s return of hail, frost, and snow. The afflictions are in the west; the lung is affected, with ailments residing in the chest, sides, shoulders, and back, manifesting externally in the skin and hair.</p>
<p>The notes clarify that the radiant and oppressive nature is the transformation of fire. The Six Elements’ Correct Record states that the lesser yang corresponds to fire, generating steam and humidity. This reflects the constant virtue of transformation. The chest contains the lungs; within the sides are the cloud gate and the heavenly treasury, where the lung meridian emerges. The shoulders and back pertain to the lung reserve, with the skin and hair being under the governance of the lungs.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>When water is insufficient, the four dimensions will be enhanced by the torrential transformation of dust and clouds, leading to gentle winds occasionally arising in response; when dust overwhelms and suddenly pours down, there will also be times of drifting and shaking in restoration. The affliction is to the north, affecting the kidneys, with ailments manifesting internally in the lower back and spine marrow, and externally in the hollow valleys and knees.</p>
<p>As for the governance of the five movements, it is akin to a balance. The high is suppressed, the low is raised, transformations respond, and changes are restored. This is the principle of growth, transformation, fixation, and storage, the natural order of qi. When it deviates from its norm, the universe becomes completely obstructed.</p>
<p>The governance and regulations of the five movements of yin and yang are like the balance of scales. What is elevated and excessive must be suppressed, as it is too much; what is low and lacking must be raised, as it is insufficient. The virtuous transformations respond with the four seasons. Changes follow the times to restore; this is the principle of life, growth, transformation, and storage, the constant qi of the four seasons. When it deviates from its norm, the qi of the universe and the four seasons will all become sealed off.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>Thus it is said: The movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth are recorded by the divine; the alternation of Yin and Yang reveals the signs of cold and heat. This is the meaning of it.</p>
<p>[Note: The energetic movements of Heaven are dynamic and incessant, while the energies of Earth are still and maintain their positions. The divine refers to the nine stars hanging brightly and the seven luminaries revolving. This relates to the previous discussion of rise and fall. Triumph and recovery correspond to the movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth, and growth, transformation, and storage correspond to the alternation of Yin and Yang. Movement and stillness are not visible, yet there are divine records to observe; Yin and Yang are not measurable, but the signs of cold and heat can be known. This is the way of Heaven and Earth concerning Yin and Yang.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Your words about the changes of the five energies and the corresponding four seasons can be considered comprehensive! However, the disorder of energies arises from encounters and circumstances, resulting in sudden disasters; how can one anticipate such events? Qi Bo said: The movements and changes of Heaven and Earth are inherently not constant, yet the effects of virtuous governance and decrees regarding disasters are different in their manifestations. The Emperor asked: What does this mean? Qi Bo replied: The east generates wind, and the wind arises from wood.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>Its virtue spreads harmony, its transformation brings prosperity, its governance is expansive, its commands are influential, its changes are dynamic, and its disasters are dispersed. The south generates heat, and heat produces fire. Its virtue is manifest, its transformation flourishes, its governance is reflective, its command is warm, its changes are vibrant, and its disasters scorch. The center generates moisture, and moisture produces earth. Its virtue is humid, its transformation is abundant, its governance is tranquil, its command is moist, its changes are sudden, and its disasters are torrential. The west generates dryness, and dryness produces metal. Its virtue is pure, its transformation is restrained, its governance is incisive, its command is dry, its changes are severe, and its disasters are devastating. The north generates cold, and cold produces water. Its virtue is desolate, its transformation is serene, its governance is solemn, its command is cold, its changes are frigid, and its disasters are hail and snow. Thus, one should observe its movements. There are virtue, transformation, governance, commands, changes, and disasters; things arise from these, and people respond accordingly. This discusses the energies of the five movements and four seasons, highlighting the distinctions of virtue, transformation, governance, commands, and disasters, which must be observed to be understood. In years of excess, there is indulgence; in years of deficiency, there is recovery. This is the regularity of seasonal movements, which can be correlated accordingly.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>The energies of the Five Movements arise from the Five Directions; the energies of the Five Directions converge in the Four Seasons. Although there are changes in the yearly cycles, such as excess and stagnation, there are also harmonies from virtue, transformation, policies, and commands in the Four Seasons, which differ from the annual cycles. Therefore, one must observe the movements of these energies, noting whether they are virtuous, transformative, political, or commanding, as well as whether they indicate disaster or change. All things are affected by these forces, leading to success or failure, and people respond accordingly—either suffering from illness or enjoying health. This relationship of the energies is influenced by the year, the season, the constant, and the variable, and it cannot be predetermined. The Emperor asked: &quot;Your words about the yearly cycles say that there must be balance, corresponding with the Five Stars. Now, virtues, transformations, policies, disasters, and changes are not constant but can arise unexpectedly; do these also lead to changes in the Five Stars?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;We act in accordance with Heaven, hence there should be no reckless actions, and everything will respond appropriately.&quot;<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>In the end, those actions that occur abruptly are due to the sudden changes in the prevailing energy, which do not respond accordingly. Therefore, it is said: responses are constant, but abrupt actions do not receive a response; this is what it means. </p>
<p>These words imply that the five celestial bodies signify the cycles of the years, yet they do not respond to the abrupt changes of the seasonal energies. To &quot;bear the heaven&quot; means to accept the energies of the five cycles, which align with the transformations of the heavenly stems. By following the heavenly order and acting accordingly, there should be no unprovoked actions, and one will always respond to the five celestial bodies. Abrupt actions arise from the exchanges of the seasonal energies, which do not align with the five celestial bodies; hence, it is again said: responses are constant, but abrupt actions do not receive a response. </p>
<p>&quot;Constant&quot; refers to the five cycles governing the year, which may have excessive or deficient energies and display equilibrium in their interactions. &quot;Abrupt&quot; refers to the energies of the five directions and four seasons, which may suddenly bring about transformations, decrees, disasters, or changes.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How is this to be responded to? Qibo replied: Each follows its own energy transformations.</p>
<p>&quot;Energy transformations&quot; refer to the transformations of the five cycles’ energies. The energy of the Jia and Ji cycles transforms into earth, the energy of the Yi and Geng cycles transforms into metal, the energy of the Bing and Xin cycles transforms into water, the energy of the Ding and Ren cycles transforms into wood, and the energy of the Wu and Ji cycles transforms into fire. The years governed by the five yang energies are excessive, while those governed by the five yin energies are deficient, and each corresponds to the five elements in heaven.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How do these actions proceed, regarding their speed, and whether they are in harmony or opposition?<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br><strong>Qibo said</strong>: To retain the path for a long time, to guard against retreat while remaining small, is called observing the lower realms. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The path refers to the route of the five stars. To retain long means to delay and prolong. Guarding against retreat means to go against the advance and maintain its measure. Being small means that light does not manifest. Observing the lower realms refers to observing the distinctions below, in relation to the virtues and faults of rulers and subjects. </p>
<p>To leave by the path and return swiftly, meandering and passing it by, is called inspecting the overlooked faults. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This means to leave and quickly return, navigating through delays while exceeding the measure. Inspecting overlooked faults refers to examining areas that have not been fully addressed, then revisiting the faults that were neglected. </p>
<p>Staying for a long time and revolving, either departing or adhering, is called deliberating on calamity and its virtues. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: To stay for a long time means to maintain one&#39;s position and not depart. Revolving means to rotate and circulate. Either departing or adhering indicates a desire to leave but not leaving. Deliberating on calamity and virtue means discussing the faults of rulers and subjects that might result in calamities versus discussing the virtuous that might result in blessings. </p>
<p>Responding to the near is small, responding to the far is great.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>The notes clarify that misfortunes and blessings correspond to the distance between realms. The brightness is much greater than normal; a doubling of the normal leads to calamities. A slight normality reduces the brightness; another slight normality is referred to as &quot;close observation.&quot; Shortcomings are compared to virtue. Virtue brings blessings, whereas shortcomings bring retribution.</p>
<p>The brightness refers to the light of the five stars. Transformation indicates the overwhelming and restorative energy. When the restorative energy is abundant, the celestial light shines greatly beyond the norm; when the restorative energy diminishes, the celestial light appears smaller than usual. If the brightness is twice that of the normal, calamities will ensue.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>If it is less than twice the usual, this is called &quot;observational vision,&quot; meaning to look from above downwards, scrutinizing the virtues of the ruler and the people, granting blessings to the virtuous, and punishing the transgressors with disasters. Therefore, the visibility of the stars is such that those high and distant appear small, while those low and near appear large. Thus, when great, joy and anger are close; when small, blessings and disasters are distant. </p>
<p>[Note: Stars high and distant appear small; stars low and near appear large. Joy and anger represent the emotional states of the stars. When the ruler and the people are virtuous, the star imagery expresses joy; when they are at fault, the star imagery expresses anger. When the radiance is greatly magnified, the errors become evident. When the vigilance is small, it seeks to lessen the faults of the ruler and the people. The first speaks to the size of the star imagery corresponding to the distance; the second speaks to the size of the star imagery in relation to the degree of victory and loss; the last addresses the size of the star imagery in relation to the swiftness or delay of blessings and disasters.] </p>
<p>If the annual cycle is excessively overreaching, then the operational stars will move northward.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>【Note: The运星 (Yunxing), or the Star of Fortune, refers to the annual cosmic alignment in the twelfth year known as the Year of the Heavenly Symbol, where cosmic energies are particularly strong. 运星 governs the year&#39;s star. 北越 (Beiyue) means going beyond its original measure, becoming closer to the North. The North is the residence of Taiyi, and the conjunction of 北越 with 天枢 (Tianshu) gives it the additional name of 太乙天符 (Taiyi Heavenly Symbol).】 When the energies of fortune and cosmic influences align, they each follow their own path.</p>
<p>【Note: When the energies align, it means the Wood influence meets the Rabbit, the Fire influence meets the Horse, the Earth influence meets the four seasons, the Metal influence meets the Rooster, and the Water influence meets the Rat. This alignment of cosmic energies with the annual energies results in a harmonious year where the stars operate within their proper measures without overwhelming dominance.】 Thus, if the yearly influence is excessive, the ruling star will lose its brilliance and be compromised by its mother influence. If it is insufficient, its appearance will be affected by what it cannot withstand. 【Note: This continues the previous discussion; for example, if the yearly Wood influence is excessive, the ruling star will overreach into territories it cannot dominate, thus losing luminosity. If the yearly Earth influence is excessive, the ruling star will invade territories of Water it cannot overcome, resulting in the losing star losing luminosity.】<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>Those who share in the essence of their mother are said to share in the essence of the Mother of the Stars of Fear, which also loses its color. The Mother of the Stars of Fear is the same as the Child of the Winning Star, suggesting that when it becomes excessive, it causes harm, and cannot nurture its child’s essence. In a year when the influences are insufficient, the stars that are not conquered also simultaneously appear in color. For example, if wood is insufficient in the year, the influencing star, the Bright White Star, increases in brightness, while the energy of the earth that is not conquered is fearless; thus, its stable star also simultaneously reveals its color. The five movements are the same.</p>
<p>The resemblance is obscure, and none can grasp its subtleties. Those who are mournful—who sets the good standard? </p>
<p>(Note: The term &quot;resemblance&quot; refers to following a principle or model; &quot;obscure&quot; indicates a perplexing demeanor. This suggests that when taking guidance from star patterns—good or ill—none can fully understand their subtle intricacies. The sentiment of being mournful indicates an anxiety in observing the star’s consistency of change in emotions and conditions, questioning which law should be preferred, highlighting the difficulty in divining star patterns.)</p>
<p>Irresponsible actions lack basis, indicating fear toward the ruler.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>Annotations: If one does not seek good methods but makes reckless statements about omens, then whatever is said about fortune and misfortune lacks evidence. This only serves to instill fear in lords and kings, indicating a lack of learning and skill in diviners. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What are the indications of calamity? Qi Bo replied: Each calamity comes from its own transformation. Therefore, there are times of prosperity and decline, violations of proper order, varying numbers of protective forces, visible signs of good and evil, conditions of victory and defeat, and manifestations of fortune and misfortune.</p>
<p>Annotations: The indications of calamity refer to changes in the five planets, which result in disasters affecting the populace. Each follows the energies of the five elements. The changes in the five planets occur in due time, bringing both prosperity and decline, with mutual violations and proper sequences; on certain days of protection, there are many or few; the visible signs may indicate joy and abundance or worry and anger; the five constellations may reflect victories or losses; they correspond to the ruler and the people, yielding blessings of virtue or disasters and illness.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What do you mean by good and evil? Qi Bo replied: There is joy and anger, worry and mourning, abundance and drought. These are the constants of signs, and they must be carefully observed.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>[Note: Wang Bing said: The appearance of the Five Stars occurs when seen in the deep of night. When people see it, they feel joy; this is the joy of the stars. If they see it with fear, this is the anger of the stars. When the light is dim and flickering, appearing sometimes bright and sometimes dark, this reflects the worry of the stars. When the light is completely distinct, neither bright nor dull, and does not resemble others, this signifies the loss of the stars. When the light is round and clear, neither growing nor shrinking, appearing serene and radiant, this is the joy of the stars. When the light comes forth with intensity, overflowing with brilliance, and its appearance is awe-inspiring, this indicates the anger of the stars.] The Emperor asked: Are the six phenomena different in height and depth? Qi Bo answered: The manifestations vary in height and depth, yet their responses are unified; hence, people respond correspondingly. [Note: This refers to the manifestations of joy, anger, worry, loss, grace, and dryness. Despite being high or small, near or far, their responses are unified, allowing people to respond and determine auspiciousness or misfortune without distinction.] The Emperor said: Good! What about the effects of virtue and governance on movement and stillness, loss and gain? Qi Bo replied: Virtue and governance cannot increase through calamities and changes. [Note: Wang Bing said: The movements and stillness of heaven and earth, the cyclical changes of yin and yang, repay virtue with virtue and transformation with transformation. The effects of governance and disasters are the same; hence, they cannot increase.] Prosperity and decline cannot be multiplied.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>【Note: Wang Bing said: &quot;Victory overshadows abundance, and victory diminishes abundance. Therefore, it is said that they cannot exceed each other.&quot; The interactions of the small and large also cannot surpass one another.】</p>
<p>【Note: Excess leads to a great year, insufficiency leads to a small year. When there is surplus, it goes forth,but when there is a lack, it follows behind; hence, it is said that they cannot surpass one another.】 The use of ascending and descending also cannot exist without each other.</p>
<p>【Note: &#39;Use&#39; refers to the operation of yin and yang energies. The qi of heaven and earth, when it ascends, then descends; when it descends, then ascends. Cold follows warmth, and warmth follows cold. Therefore, it is said that they cannot exist without each other.】 Each acts according to its movement and returns accordingly.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The interactions of winning and losing, the ascension and descension of yin and yang, all follow the movements of their respective energies. The Treatise on the Six Subtle Points states: Success and failure depend on movement. If there is unceasing movement, then transformation occurs!</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How does illness arise? Qi Bo replied: The transformation of qi is an omen of virtue; political decrees represent the manifestation of qi; changes indicate the pattern of return; disasters and misfortunes mark the beginning of harm.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This refers to illness arising from changes. The quality and transformation of seasonal qi is the harmony of qi; having governance and decrees signifies the elucidation of qi. Changes are indicative of retribution, while disasters and misfortunes originate from the harm experienced by the people. </p>
<p>When qi overcomes one another, there is harmony; when it does not, there is illness. Severe affliction from the pathogenic influence leads to serious conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Qi refers to the transformative energy. According to the Treatise on the Six Organs and Their Correspondences, illness arises upon change; what is overcome is subtle, while what is not is illness, leading to severe affliction from the pathogenic influence resulting in death. Thus, if conditions are not right, it remains subtle; when conditions are right, it becomes severe. This refers to the transition of qi: spring transforms into the energy of late summer, late summer into winter qi, winter transitions to the heat of summer, summer shifts to autumn qi, and autumn reverts back to spring qi. The concept of achieving the victories of the five elements in their appropriate times leads to the mutual victory and transformation of seasonal qi, resulting in harmony. If the wood element does not flourish in spring, and if the metal element becomes excessive, then spring can turn into a season of harshness.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>If the fire of the year is insufficient and the water of the year is excessive, during summer it should be hot, yet cold air prevails; at this time, the seasonal energies do not overcome the transformed energies, leading to illness. Therefore, when the time is not suitable for overcoming, it is mild; when the time is suitable for overcoming, it is severe. Those who are heavily affected by evils refer to the evils of the four seasons being out of order.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;Good! The discussion of the essence of light, the great sage&#39;s undertaking, clarifies the great way and connects to the infinite, reaching the boundless. I have heard that a good expression of heavenly concepts must resonate with humanity; a good expression of antiquity must validate in the present; a good expression of qi must manifest in things; a good expression of response harmonizes with the transformations of heaven and earth. Those who speak well of transformation and change convey the principles of the divine. Who but the Master can articulate the ultimate way?&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: The discussion of the essence of light refers to the principles of the divine. The great sage&#39;s undertaking reaches the infinite, governing the people above and cultivating oneself below, with virtue and grace flowing downwards, bestowed upon future generations, with no end in sight. The Book of Changes states: “Those who understand the way of transformation know what the divine accomplishes.”] </p>
<p>He then chose a good omen and stored it in the spiritual chamber, reading it every morning, calling it the interplay of qi and change. He did not dare to speak it without fasting and performing self-discipline, exercising caution in its transmission.</p>
<p>[Note: The spiritual chamber refers to the secret space of the spiritual orchid. It represents the way of yin and yang of heaven and earth, which the supreme deity values. Not daring to speak it without fasting demonstrates utmost respect and caution, fearing to pass it on to the wrong person and carelessly disclose the heavenly treasures.]<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br><strong>The Great Discussion on the Five Constants of Governance [Part 1]</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;The vastness of the great void is expansive, the five movements rotate irregularly, prosperity and decline differ, and losses and gains follow each other. I wish to know how to define ‘balanced qi’ and what it signifies in terms of regulation.&quot;</p>
<p>Qi Bo replied: &quot;What an excellent question! The Wood element represents harmony, Fire signifies brightness and elevation, Earth embodies nurturing transformation, Metal symbolizes refinement and balance, and Water signifies tranquility and acquiescence.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;What happens when it is inadequate?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Wood represents waning harmony, Fire indicates concealed brightness, Earth stands for lowered supervision, Metal means following change, and Water signifies diminished flow.&quot;</p>
<p>This describes the inadequacy of the five movements, each having its own designation. When the Wood element is lacking, it cannot spread the warm and harmonizing qi and therefore weakens.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>If the fire energy is insufficient, then the brightness of its decree will not rise but will be subdued. If the earth energy is insufficient, then the lowly will guard but cannot provide for the four directions. The nature of metal is inherently rigid; if it is insufficient, it will change due to the influence of fire. If the water energy is insufficient, then the source and flow will dry up.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What is excessive?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Wood signifies growth, fire signifies brilliance, earth signifies stability, metal signifies solidity, and water signifies overflowing.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The five energies being excessive each have corresponding names. The excess of wood energy is growth at its peak. Brilliance symbolizes abundant light. Stability signifies height and substance. The essence of metal is solid and firm, useful for creation. Overflowing means being full and spilling over.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said, &quot;I wish to hear about the indicators of the three energies.&quot; Qibo replied, &quot;What a thorough question! In the season of harmony, the virtue of wood circulates broadly, yang expands while yin disperses, the five transformations are manifested and balanced; their energy is upright, their nature follows, their applications vary, their transformations produce prosperity, they correspond to plants and trees, their governance is expansive, their indicators are warm and harmonious, their decree is wind, and their organ is the liver. The liver fears clarity, governs the eyes, corresponds to hemp grains, fruits that are plums, is solid in form, responds in springtime, corresponds to insect fur, is related to dogs, its color is green, it nourishes tendons, its ailments are urgent fullness in the interior, its flavor is sour, its tone is the horn, its substance is firm in the middle, and its number is eight.&quot;<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>The Three Energies refer to the balanced energy and the extremes of excess and deficiency. The balanced motion of wood represents harmony. When the virtue of wood circulates freely, the yang energy expands and the yin energy diffuses, encompassing the five energies of growth, transformation, storage, and their emergence. When the growth energy is harmonious, all five energies are balanced. &quot;Duan&quot; signifies uprightness, while &quot;Sui&quot; embodies softness and obedience. The straight and curved represent the characteristics and utility of wood. &quot;Sheng Rong&quot; refers to the vitality of wood’s growth and transformation. &quot;Lei&quot; pertains to the classification of things. The emergence and scattering signify the governance by wood. &quot;Wen He&quot; indicates the warmth and harmony of spring. The wind in the sky represents the commands of wood. Within the organs, it corresponds to the liver, which fears the clarity that wood resists against metal. It relates to the eyes among the sensory organs. In the grains, it corresponds to hemp, which resembles wood in form and has a green hue. In fruits, it represents the season, appearing green and tasting sour. The core contains the kernel, which is split into two parts, representing the origin of wood’s vitality. Caterpillars, like the dense forests of grass and trees, are born from vegetation. Dogs exhibit a courageous disposition, responding to the rising energy of spring with anger. The liver governs the tendons, therefore its nourishment is in the sinews. Abdominal urgency and fullness are symptoms of liver illness. &quot;Jiao&quot; is the sound of wood, which thrives in water, making it strong and resilient. The number eight is the manifestation of wood. In the era of rising brightness, governance is based on rectified yang, where virtues are widely applied and the five transformations are balanced.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Its energy is high, its nature is swift, its function is to burn and scorch, its transformation is abundant, its kind is fire, its governance is bright and radiant, its climate is hot and sultry, its command is heat, and its organ is the heart. The heart fears cold, it governs the tongue, its grains are wheat, its fruit is apricot, its essence is connected, it responds to summer, its insects fly, its livestock is horses, its color is red, it nourishes blood, its sickness is twitching and convulsions, its taste is bitter, its sound is a signal, its substance is veins, and its number is seven. </p>
<p>(Note: Fire is positioned in the south, hence it governs the Yang. Fire represents Yang energy, whereby virtues are distributed widely. The warmth of Yang energy is extensively disseminated, and all transformations are balanced, all influenced by the transformation of fire. The energy of fire rises high, hence its energy is elevated; its nature is active and urgent, thus it is swift. Burning and scorching is its function. The flourishing of all things is the transformation of summer. All terrestrial fire shares a kindred nature. Brightness and radiance are the governance of fire. Hot and sultry is the climate of summer. In the heavens, it manifests as heat, which is commanded by fire. In the organs, it is the heart; the heart fears cold because fire fears water. The heart opens to the tongue. Wheat is the grain that matures in summer. The color of apricot is red, and its taste is bitter. Connection refers to the veins of the fruit. Insects that can fly are inspired by the energy of fire. Horses belong to the noon, the livestock of fire. The heart governs blood vessels, thus its nourishment is found in blood. Twitching and convulsions occur when the meridians respond to the energy of fire with contraction. Signal is the sound of fire. Bitter is the taste of fire. Veins refer to the networks of substances. Seven is the number representing the essence of fire.)<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>In the era of preparation for transformation, the air is in harmony with heavenly rest. Virtue flows through the four forms of governance, and the five transformations are cultivated together. Its essence is balanced, its nature is compliant, its applications are high and low, its transformations are abundant, its category is earth, its governance is tranquil, its climate is humid and warm, its laws are moist, and its organ is the spleen. The spleen fears the wind, governs the mouth, relates to grains such as millet, fruits such as jujubes, and the substance of meat, responding to the long summer, to parasitic insects, to livestock such as cattle, exhibiting a yellow color, nourishing meat, and dealing with sickness. Its flavor is sweet, its tone is royal, its material is skin, and its number is five.</p>
<p>[Note: Heavenly dominion brings forth life, while earthly dominion nurtures growth. The air of the earth is harmonious and combines with the beauty of heavenly rest, thereby leading to the emergence of all things. The virtues of the earth flow in all directions, allowing the five transformations to develop together. Balance is the essence of earth; gentleness is its inherent nature; high and low represents its body. Both elevation and depression encompass its transformations, demonstrating the utility of the earth. Abundance and richness signify the humidity associated with the earth&#39;s transformation. The five directions correspond to the five types of earth, being of the same category. Tranquility and transformation signify the governance of the earth. Warmth and humidity denote the weather of the long summer. Humidity in the heavens represents the laws of earth, while the spleen governs the organ. The fear of wind corresponds to wood, which overcomes earth. The spleen opens to the mouth. Millet is a type of fine grain. Jujubes are yellow in color and sweet in taste. Meat refers to the flesh of fruits. Parasitic worms are afflictions of the physical body. Cattle are livestock pertaining to the earth. The spleen governs muscles, thus its nourishment is in meat.]<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>Otherwise, the disease of the spleen resides within, and the energies above and below do not interact. The sound of the palace is the sound of the central land. The skin refers to the flesh of the body. The five correspond to the generative numbers of earth. The &quot;Lun&quot; on the six correct registers states: Earth always generates.</p>
<p>Examining the equilibrium of the registers, it accumulates without contention, kills without offense, and the five transformations are clear and distinct. Its energy is pure, its nature is strong, its function is to disperse, its transformation is to consolidate, it resembles metal, its governance is vigorous and austere, its season is clear-cut, its command is dry, and its organ is the lung. The lung fears heat, governs the nose, corresponds to grains and rice, fruits like peaches, has a hard shell, responds to autumn, relates to insects like pests, is associated with chickens, is white in color, nourishes skin and fur, and has coughing as its ailment, its taste is spicy, its tone is that of &quot;shang,&quot; its material is externally firm, and its number is nine.</p>
<p>(Note: Gold symbolizes weaponry, and the energy of metal is balanced, hence it accumulates and does not contend. The energies of heaven and earth bring forth life in spring and kill in autumn; killing without offense means not harming anything. The energy of metal is pure and clear, thus the five transformations obtain clarity. Brightness is the energy of gold. Strength and firmness are the nature of metal. All things disperse in the influence of metal. Its energy consolidates, representing the transformation of autumn. The five kinds of metal belong to this category. Firmness, strength, and clarity signify the governance of metal. Clarity relates to the season of autumn. In heaven, it represents dryness, as per the command of metal. The organ is the lung, which fears heat, hence metal fears fire. The lung opens at the nose.)<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Rice is the grain that matures in autumn. Peaches are pink and white, and have fuzz; they are the fruits of the lungs. The hard-shelled fruit and the armored insects are all born from the strong and firm energy. Chickens are naturally combative, influenced by the chilling and lethal energy. The lungs govern the skin and fur, so their nourishment lies in the skin and fur. Coughing is an illness of the lungs. The Shang relates to the sound of the west. Sin represents the flavor of metal. All things share a solid essence, just like the hard shells and armored insects. Nine is the number associated with metal.</p>
<p>The tranquility and compliance of the discipline entails concealment without harm, governing in a way that promotes good descent; thus, the five transformations align harmoniously. Its energy is clear, its nature descends, its function is nourishing and expansive, its transformation is concrete and firm, it is akin to water, its regulations flow and evolve, its conditions are still and austere, its enforcement is cold, and its organ is the kidneys. The kidneys fear moisture and govern the two yin, their grains and beans, their fruit and chestnuts, their essence is moist, responding to winter. They contain insects and scales, domesticate pigs, their color is black, they nourish the bones and marrow, their illness is fatigue, their flavor is salty, their sound is like feathers, their substance is moist, and their number is six.</p>
<p>(Note: The commentary mentions that the smooth functioning of water is known as tranquility and compliance. All things prosper by receiving the vital energy for growth, and with the smooth flow of water, it supports concealment without harming anything. With good governance and descent, the five energies respond, hence they are in harmony. Heaven produces water, therefore its energy is lofty and bright. The essence of water seeks to lower, hence its nature descends. The solidity and firmness of all things is derived from the transformation of concealed energy.)<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>The waters of the great earth, like kindred spirits, flow and never cease; this is the governance of water. Condensed and solemn is the season of winter. In the heavens, it manifests as the decree of cold water. In the organs, it corresponds to the kidneys, which are sensitive to dampness; water fears earth. The kidneys open to the two yin passages, thus they govern them. The bean is the valley of water. Its dark brown color and salty flavor are the essence of the kidneys. Moisture refers to that which contains liquid within. Scaled creatures arise from water. The kidneys govern bone marrow, hence their nourishment is found in marrow. The kidneys are the source of vitality; thus when one is ill, the hands and feet become cold. The sound of feathers is associated with water. Six represents the number characterized by water.</p>
<p>Therefore, to allow life and not to kill, to nurture and not to punish, to transform and not to constrain, to gather and not to harm, to store and not to repress—this is called harmonious Qi. </p>
<p>Thus, in the years governed by wood, life energy is obtained without the harshness of metal. In the years governed by fire, the nurturing energy flows without the constraints of water. In the years of earth, transformative energy flourishes without the governance of wood. In the years of metal, gathering energy is achieved without the harm of fire. In the years of water, storing energy is possible without the repression of earth. This is called the year of harmonious Qi.</p>
<p>The principles of harmony are said to conquer life. When life energy does not govern, transforming energy is then exalted. Nurturing energy is naturally balanced, and the decree of gathering comes early. Cool rain descends timely, and wind and clouds rise together. Plants and trees flourish late, their leaves withering and falling. Things bloom and bear fruit, with flesh and skin richly filled within.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>Its energy is condensed, its function is gathered, its movement is soft, restrained, and slow; it emerges with shock and fear. Its organs are the liver, its fruits are jujubes and plums, its solids are kernels and shells, its grains are millet and rice, its taste is sour and bitter, its color is white and grey, its domesticated animals are dogs and chickens, its insects are hairy and shell-like. Its master is fog and dew, sorrowful and desolate; its sound is the musical notes of Jiao and Shang. Its ailments include shaking, edema, and sores. Sweet insects are harmful to the liver. The upper official corresponds to the central palace. When the winds blow fiercely, there is turmoil, and malignancies occur. The so-called revival is masterful over flying and tunneling insects, resembling thunder. If the Wood element is insufficient, it is said to be harmonious, thus the victorious energy conquers its vitality. If the Metal energy is strong, the life force of Wood cannot establish its governance. If the Wood governance is not established, then the Earth energy has no fear, and the transformative energy rises. When Wood declines, the Fire energy does not flourish, thus the breath stabilizes. Since the Metal energy is abundant, the collection and commands happen early. Coolness represents Metal transformation, wind corresponds to Wood transformation, and clouds and rain represent Earth transformation; this occurs because the Wood operation is insufficient, hence there are aspects of Metal and Earth transformation. When the vital energy does not govern, the grasses and trees flourish late. The collection and commands arrive early; thus, the crust is dry and the fruits fall. The transformative energy, aligned with the autumnal energies, makes it possible for things to flourish and be substantial, nourishing the inner reaches.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>Convergence is the essence of metal. Gathering is the function of wood. Movement indicates the internal onset of illness; emergence indicates the external manifestation of symptoms. Binding indicates contraction; obstruction indicates thoroughness; restraint indicates urgency; relaxation indicates non-convergence; these are all ailments of the tendons. The Golden Chamber&#39;s true words state: In the east, the liver is wood, and its illness manifests as fright. The organ is the liver. Its fruits are jujubes and plums, its shells are pits, its grains are millet and rice, its flavors are sour and pungent, its colors are pale, its animals are dogs and chickens, its insects are hairy and shelled, its sounds are those of horns and merchants. Due to the inadequacy of wood&#39;s growth, it is thus transformed by metal and earth. It governs fog and dew, evoking melancholy, overpowering wood; its illness involves agitation and dread, a liver condition, as it stems from metal&#39;s transformation. Judgment means half. The lesser horn and judgment merchant are collectively referred to as the year of the six ding, a year when wood&#39;s growth is insufficient. The horn indicates the sound of wood, so when wood&#39;s growth is insufficient, it governs the lesser horn. Metal is also engaged; thus half aligns with the merchant&#39;s metal transformation. The upper horn and correct horn are the same as the years of ding-si and ding-hai. In those years, it encounters the Jueyin celestial official, and since wood&#39;s growth is inadequate, it receives celestial assistance, thus resembling the harmonious correct horn. The upper merchant and correct merchant are identical in the years ding-mao and ding-you. In those years, it meets the Yangming celestial official, hence referred to as the upper merchant. With insufficient wood growth, half of the merchant transforms, while also coinciding with the Yangming celestial official&#39;s time, so metal is fully engaged, aligning with the authentic merchant of balanced assessment.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>Therefore, ailments manifesting as limb atrophy, sores, and abscesses, along with sweet pests, all arise from a surfeit of metal energy harming the liver. The upper palace shares qualities with the main palace, corresponding to the years of Ding Chou and Ding Wei, when the Tai Yin governs the heavens. Hence, it is called the upper palace. During this time, wood does not flourish; its transformative energy is thus weakened, but it also receives assistance from the heavenly governance. This allows the earth to dominate and aligns with the cycle of transformation, thus making the upper palace akin to the main palace. The autumn winds are harsh and the metal energy is excessive. The heat blazes and boils—this indicates the return of fire. Disasters and misfortunes are associated with the eastern position of Zhen. The term &quot;return&quot; refers to decay arising from wood, and the fire element is represented by flying, indicating the fire generated within wood itself. Maggots are the offspring of flies; when maggots enter ash, they transform into flies. Flies prefer warmth and despise cold, flying by day and hiding at night. The pheasant, as a kind of bird, embodies the transformative energy of fire. The rapidity of thunder is called ting; when wood experiences extreme accumulation, fire wraps around it, producing the energy known as thunder. Thus, the I Ching states that Zhen represents thunder.</p>
<p>The record of hidden brightness is called &quot;victorious growth.&quot; When the vital energy is not expressed, it becomes repressed. Collecting energy through regulation leads to balance. The effect of cold clarity is repeated, while heat leads to lightness. Following transformation, life emerges; it grows but does not extend. It becomes substantial yet remains immature, encountering transformation while already aged. The yang energy is restrained, causing hibernating insects to conceal themselves early.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>Its essence is repressed, its use is violent, its movement is evident in change, its release causes pain, its organ is the heart, its fruit is the chestnut and peach, its substance is intertwined and moist, its crops are beans and rice, its taste is bitter and salty, its color is the original cinnabar, its livestock are horses and pigs, its insects have feathers and scales, its master is ice, snow, frost, and cold, its sound is the call of feathers, its illnesses are confusion, sorrow, and forgetfulness, arising from the influence of water. The minor signs are the same as the minor feathers; the upper commerce is the same as the correct commerce. Evil harms the heart. Gathering cold and somber, it brings heavy rain and deluge, afflicting the nine realms. Its master causes sudden downpours, thunder and lightning disturb, and persistent rain falls. </p>
<p>(Note: Fire&#39;s absence leads to water prevailing over its growth; thus, the long essence of fire remains unexpressed, while the concealed essence of water becomes manifest. When the essence of fire is subdued, metal has nothing to fear, allowing it to gather its essence and govern independently. Without sufficient fire, the essence of the earth it produces does not thrive, hence balance in transformation is initiated.)<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>The cold is persistently clear, and the heat is gradually diminishing; water prevails over fire. As the transformative energy of the earth achieves balance, living things are able to grow. If the energy is not expressed, growth will stall, and thus even the young that have become real will age when they encounter the transformative energy of long summer. The cold and clarity cause the yang energy to retreat. The hidden energy is utilized, causing hibernating insects to come out early. When the energy is stagnant, water restrains its fire. When it is harshly utilized, the nature of fire desires to manifest. The manifesting is the governance of fire. When the manifest becomes concealed, it transforms and becomes cold, producing pain, as the victory of cold leads to pain. The organ associated with the heart is represented by fruits such as chestnuts and peaches, real items like mulberries, grains like beans and rice, flavors like bitterness and saltiness, colors like cinnabar, livestock like horses and pigs, creatures like insects with feathers and scales, and sounds like musical notes from feathers—all experience inadequate movement of fire and thus are influenced by the transformations of metal and water. Ice, snow, and frost are changes brought by water.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>Confusion and sorrow cloud the mind, leaving it insufficient; thus, influenced by water, the heart&#39;s fire is diminished. The concept of &quot;lesser fortune&quot; and &quot;lesser wings&quot; both refer to the six Gui years. &quot;Lesser fortune&quot; represents a fire tone, which lacks vigor; hence it is called lesser fortune. Minor engagements occur, therefore lesser fortune and lesser wings transform similarly. The Upper Shang and the True Shang share the same characteristics; they correspond to the Gui-Mao and Gui-You years, where the heavens favor the sun&#39;s brightness, hence named Upper Shang. Metal fears nothing but gains the aid of the heavens, marking the cycle of fire&#39;s movement and enforcing fair governance; thus, the years of Upper Shang share the same atmosphere as those of True Shang. The combination of metal and water is victorious, yet causes harm to the heart. The atmosphere is heavy and cold, and the intense cold prevails. Relentless rain brings about the return of earth. Disasters and misfortunes are expected from the south of the Li position. Dull clouds obscure the sun. Sudden downpours and excessive rain signify changes in the earth. Thunder shakes the ground, causing fire to surge forth.</p>
<p>The chronicle of the low overseers is called diminished transformation. The energy of transformation does not command, and governance becomes pronounced. When the energy is harmonized, rain becomes misaligned. When energy is contained and balanced, cold winds arise. Vegetation flourishes and appears beautiful, yet lacks substance; it matures only to produce emptiness.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>Its qi is dispersed, its function is calm and stable. Its motion causes sores to burst and swelling to fester. Its manifestations are damp and stagnant. Its organ is the spleen. Its fruits are plums and chestnuts, and its seeds are damp and hard. Its grains are beans and hemp. Its flavor is sour and sweet, and its color is dim yellow. Its livestock includes cattle and dogs. Its insects are hairy and worms. Its primary qualities are drifting, anger, and shaking hair. Its sound is like the palace bell and horn. Its afflictions cause fullness or blockage due to the influence of wood. The lesser palace corresponds with the lesser horn; the upper palace aligns with the true palace; the upper horn matches the true horn. Its illness involves diarrhea and leakage, harmed by evil affecting the spleen. When it shakes and sways, it becomes sparse and falls apart, with its flaws spanning in four directions. Its nature yields to tigers and wolves, and clear qi then is useful, whereas life governance brings disgrace. </p>
<p>(Note: If the earth element is not thriving, then its transformative qi is diminished, and wood overpowers it, thus the transformative qi cannot exercise its command, while the governance of life notably manifests. Wood generates fire, hence the growth of qi is orderly. When the transformative qi does not command, rain becomes overdue.)<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The earth&#39;s energy is insufficient, thus it self-regulates. The dominance of wood and water causes both wind and cold to arise. The vital energy is pronounced and well-organized, allowing plants to flourish beautifully. When transformative energy is lacking, even when they grow, they may be unproductive and withered. Divergence represents the energy of wood. Tranquility is the function of earth. Conditions like sores and abscesses arise in opposition to the flesh, leading to swelling and inflammation. Humidity and stagnation indicate water&#39;s influence over earth-related illnesses. The related organ is the spleen; its fruit includes plums and chestnuts, its essence is moist, its grains include beans and sesame, its flavor is sour and sweet, its color is bluish-yellow, its livestock are cattle and dogs, its parasites are lice and fur, its sound is akin to the gong and the horn. Because earth&#39;s energy is insufficient, it also derives from the transformations of water and wood. Fluctuation and anger reflect the dominance of wood&#39;s energy. Retention and obstruction indicate damage to the spleen&#39;s energy. The lesser palace and lesser horn are both termed the six personal years. The palace represents the sound of earth, and when earth&#39;s energy is insufficient, it is called the lesser palace. Wood also plays a role, thus the lesser palace and lesser horn share a transformation.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>The upper palace, being the same as the central palace, pertains to the years of Ji Yin and Ji Wei. It is positioned above the Great Yin, moist earth, and the ruler of heaven, hence it is called the upper palace. When the earthly influence is insufficient and yet it receives the assistance of the ruler of heaven, it denotes the season of the lesser palace, where the transformative energy is complete, thus aligning with the central palace.</p>
<p>The upper corner, being the same as the central corner, pertains to the years of Ji Si and Ji Hai. It lies above the Great Yin and the ruler of heaven, thus it is called the upper corner. This corresponds to the season of the lesser palace and lesser corner, where the corner benefits from the assistance of the ruler of heaven, and wood is independent and dominant, making it similar to the central corner of the year.</p>
<p>Regarding the diseases of food retention and diarrhea, they are due to evils harming the spleen. The shaking, lifting, and fluttering indicate excessive wood. The dullness and decay of the green indicate the transition from metal to wood. The calamities and misfortunes will be in the four directions, corresponding to the areas of Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun. The destruction is the employment of metal. Tigers and wolves are animals of the west. Humiliation indicates bending; the influence of metal returns, and governance begins to be humiliated.</p>
<p>The period of change is called &quot;folding and collecting.&quot; After collection of energy comes the generation of energy, and with it, growth. The lengthy transformation corresponds to merging virtues, and the governance of fire becomes manifest, benefiting all things abundantly. The energy rises, its function becomes agitated, its movements resonate with a clang, leading to confusion, coughing, and wheezing, affecting the lungs. The fruits include plums and apricots, the shells are of the fruit, the grains include hemp and wheat, the flavors are bitter and pungent, the colors are white and reddish, the livestock are chickens and sheep, and the insects are soft-bodied and winged. It pertains to brightness and the intensity of flame. Its sound is clanging and resonant, and its diseases are sneezing, coughing, and nasal bleeding, arising from the transformation of fire. </p>
<p>Shao Shang and Shao Zheng are the same; Shang Shang and Zheng Shang are the same; the upper corner and the central corner are the same.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The邪 (evil) harms the lungs. When the flames and brightness are intense, ice, snow, frost, and hail occur, leading to misfortunes among the seven. Its master lies hidden like a pig or a rat, concealing its essence until the arrival of great cold.</p>
<p>(Note: The influence of metal is not sufficient; therefore, governance falls into disarray. When the energy is delayed, wood becomes unafraid, and vitality rises, leading to a flourishing that culminates in the merging of virtues. Hence, all things flourish due to the rising fire energy. Restlessness is a characteristic of metal. Metal governs sound; clanging and controlling means sound does not emerge. Confusion affects the lungs, causing movement issues. Reversal of breath indicates upsurging energy. Wheezing and coughing are due to fire harming the lungs. The lung&#39;s organ is central to this. Its fruits include plums and apricots, while the seeds consist of husks and grain, represented by hemp and wheat, with flavors that are bitter and pungent, and colors of white and reddish. The livestock includes chickens and sheep, while the pests are represented by insects with feathers. The sounds of commerce and taxation all arise from the insufficiency of metal energy, yet they also combine with the transformations of wood and fire. Bright celestial bodies blaze and illuminate, signifying the dominance of fire.</p>
<p>Sneezing, coughing, and nasal bleeding indicate ailments of metal. Shaoshang and Shaozheng are associated with the years of six yǐ (乙). Shang governs metal sound, and its insufficiency transforms into Shaoshang. Fire concurrently engages in actions, hence Shaozheng aligns with its transformation. Above Shang shares qualities with the regular Shang, corresponding to the years yǐ mǔ (乙卯) and yǐ yǒu (乙酉), where it oversees Yangming and the heavens, thus it is called Above Shang. The metal influence is insufficient but receives support from the heavenly realms, resulting in balanced metal energy that does not yield to overpowering fire, and thus Above Shang aligns with regular Shang. Above Jiǎo aligns with regular Jiǎo, corresponding to the years yǐ sǐ (乙巳) and yǐ hài (乙亥), where it oversees Jueyin and the heavens, thus it is called Above Jiǎo.)<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>The energy of life rises, receiving assistance from the heavens, thus aligning with the year of the proper angle. Water overcomes fire, causing evils that harm the lungs. The blaze is bright and fierce, indicating overwhelming fire. The arrival of ice, snow, frost, and hail signifies the return of water. Their disasters and misfortunes are in the west of Dui. The owner of these is the scaly creatures and the rat, all beings of water. The hidden energy arrives early, hence the birth of great cold. The end of flowing is called the reversal of yang. When hidden energy fails to rise, the transformation of energy flourishes. The long energy spreads forth, and the hibernating insects do not conceal themselves. The earth is moist, and the water springs diminish; the vegetation is lush, flourishing in abundance. When energy is stagnant, it is used for seepage; when it moves, it is firm and still; when it becomes dry, it withers. The organs are the kidneys, the fruits are jujubes and apricots, the grains are millet and rice, their flavors are sweet and salty, their hue is dark and deep. The livestock are pigs and cattle, and the insects are scaly and slimy. Its master is dust, gloom, and obscurity, its voice echoes in the palace of feathers, and its ailments are atrophy and hardening below, resulting from the transformation of earth. The lesser feather corresponds to the lesser palace; the upper palace corresponds to the proper palace. Its ailment of urinary obstruction and retention results from evil harming the kidneys. Dust and darkness with sudden rain lead to shaking and pulling, resulting in calamity as one. Its master is the hair of the fox and the raccoon, manifesting change without concealment.</p>
<p>[Note: The cold water does not reach, while yang triumphs over it. When the hidden energy of water fails to rise, the transformation of earth flourishes. When water does not rise, fire has nothing to fear, hence the long energy is able to spread forth.]<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>The heat of Yang has become excessive, causing hibernating insects not to burrow. The soil is moist, while the water springs diminish; thus, the earth prevails over water. The plants grow lush and full, thriving on the energy of growth. Moisture accumulates, a quality of the earth; infiltration serves the function of water. Its movements are firm and still; the earth controls water, resulting in accumulation. Its dryness and withering indicate a deficiency in the阴液. Its organ is the kidneys. The fruits, such as dates and apricots, the moist flesh, grains like millet and broomcorn, flavors of sweetness and saltiness, deep colors, livestock such as pigs and cattle, scales of insects, and sounds of feathers and palaces—all relate to the insufficient movement of water, thus they are transformed by the influence of fire and earth. Dust accumulates heavily, a sign of the earth&#39;s dominance. Weakness and rigidity below signify kidney ailments. Here, the insufficient movement of water reverses into transformation by earth. Those sharing the lesser feathers and palaces are collectively called the years of the six辛. Feathers symbolize the sound of water; since the movement of water is lacking, it is called lesser feathers. The earth takes on functions, hence it assimilates with the lesser palace. The upper palace being the same as the central palace refers to the years of辛丑 and辛未, as it is under the influence of太阴 overseeing the heavens, thus called the upper palace. The earth partially assumes functions and also receives aid from the heavens; hence, the record of lesser feathers corresponds with the years of the central palace. Difficulty in urination, as evil injures the kidneys, results in a failure of kidney energy to transform. Dust clouds and sudden rains indicate great indulgence in the soil. Trembling, pulling, and uprooting restore the vitality of wood. The disasters and misfortunes will manifest in the northern direction of坎.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>The fur symbolizes the gathering, born from the feelings of spring&#39;s forest air; thus, the fox and weasel display fur, making their master the fox and weasel. Therefore, when riding in danger, one moves slowly to arrive. Cruelty and lack of virtue lead to disasters befalling them. The minor returns to the minor, and the severe returns to the severe; this is the nature of existence.</p>
<p>[Note: This summarizes the previous text, stating that if the five movements do not extend, the prevailing energy moves in danger, arriving slowly. Only excess overcomes, without the virtue of harmony and auspiciousness, leading to offspring coming to seek revenge, with disasters befalling them. Overcoming the minor returns to the minor, and overcoming the severe returns to the severe; this is the regular ebb and flow of energy.]</p>
<p>The record of emergence is called the initiation of arrangement. The earth loosens and leaks, the azure energy permeates. Yang harmony spreads and transforms, while Yin energy follows. Vital energy purifies and cultivates, all things flourish. Its transformations create, its energies are beautiful, its governance spreads, its commands are clear and free, its movements are vibrant and rapid, its virtues resonate, while its changes shake and pull. Its grains are millet and rice, its livestock are chickens and dogs, its fruits are plums and peaches, its colors are blue, yellow, and white, its tastes are sour, sweet, and spicy, its imagery is spring. Its pathways are the Foot, Liver, and Spleen, its insects are hair and shell, its substances are firm inside and outside. Its ailments arise from anger, matching those of the Upper Horn and Upper Commerce. If the upper journey encounters obstructions, its energy becomes reversed, and its ailment manifests as vomiting and diarrhea. If one neglects virtue, then energy recedes. In autumn, the energy becomes vigorous and piercing; in severe cases, it leads to stagnation and death, with the clean energy greatly manifesting, causing plants and trees to decay. Evil then harms the liver.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>The abundant wood element in the year indicates the emergence of all things. Earth receives its transformations and therefore governs dispersal. The azure energy is the energy of wood. Above Jue Yin, wind and wood regulate it, hence Yang and harmony are spread above, while Yin energy follows below. With abundant life force, all things respond and thrive in beauty and fragrance. Dispersing is the governance of wood. Unfurling is the command of Yang and harmony. Dizziness and rapid ascent of wind energy dwell above. The sounds are those of wind and wood. Opening and dividing signify the emergence of spring’s energy. Shaking, pulling, and uprooting represent the changes of wind. The grains like hemp and rice, animals like chickens and dogs, fruits like plums and peaches, colors such as blue, yellow, and white, tastes like sour, sweet, and spicy, insects like furry and shelled, and things that are hard inside and strong outside are all influenced by the excessive wood energy, interconnecting and transforming with each other. Its imagery responds to spring, its channels harmonize with the liver of the foot Jue Yin and the gallbladder of the foot Shao Yang; its organs correspond to the liver and spleen. The illness of anger indicates an excess of liver energy. The great horns (Taijiao) and the Upper Shang being the same indicates that excess energy has a framework; where there is a framework, there is transformation. If the great horns’ year features excessive wood energy, then metal energy supports it, leading to the production of grains like rice and hemp, fruits like plums and peaches, livestock such as chickens and dogs, and insects with fur and shells, all responding to the influence of wood and metal energies, matching the year of Upper Shang. It is said that in all Ren years, there is no presence of Yangming, hence the great horns and Upper Shang are identical.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>When there is the Yangming influence from above, it is said that the clouds correspond with the commercial and true angles; although there is no direct influence from above, there is the natural governing power. The term &quot;upper summons&quot; refers to the influence from above, with the lesser yin&#39;s fire and the lesser yang&#39;s fire, specifically in the years of Renzi, Renwu, Renyin, and Renshen, when wood is abundant and fire energy is present above. When the child resides on the mother, the energy becomes reversed; if it reverses above, it expels; if it reverses below, it is beneficial. Excessive wood invites the return of metal energy, and if the autumn energy is intense and harsh, it leads to death; as grass and trees wither, ailments can harm the liver.</p>
<p>The record of the blazing sun is called flourishing. The yin energy is transformed internally, while the yang energy flourishes externally. The heat of summer brings transformation, allowing all things to thrive. Its transformation is long-lasting, its energy heightens, its governance moves, its commands are clear; however, its movements can be fiery, disruptive, and chaotic. Its virtue is that of warmth and humidity, and it transforms into an intense boiling. Its grains include wheat and beans, its livestock are sheep and pigs, its fruits are apricots and chestnuts; its colors are red and white, and its flavors are bitter, spicy, and salty. It symbolizes summer, governs under the lesser yin and greater sun, and the lesser yin and lesser yang. Its organs are the heart and lungs, its pests are those with feathers and scales, its matter is moist and pulse-like, and its diseases include laughter, malaria, ulcers, and blood flow, as well as mania and red eyes. The upper influences align with true summons. Its gathering leads to illness. The upper summons leads to gathering, while the energy follows. Violent governance conceals energy, then recovers; at times, there is a display of gloom, and severe conditions can bring rain, frost, and hail, leading to cold that harms the heart.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>The passage explains the influence of the summer season and the characteristics of fire energy. It describes how excessive fire leads to a vibrant growth of plants and how heat causes the inward transformation of yin energy. The outward manifestation of yang energy is evident through the bright warmth of summer, which is a time of flourishing and growth.</p>
<p>During this season, the vitality is strong, resulting in high and dynamic energy. The brightness of fire represents clarity in leadership. However, the intensity of heat can also lead to agitation and discomfort. The warmth and humidity contribute to a harmonious atmosphere, while excessive heat can lead to changes and transformations.</p>
<p>Various crops and animals thrive during this time, indicating a rich interplay of elements, including flavors and colors. This reflects the summer&#39;s essence and its connection to various meridians associated with the heart and other organs.</p>
<p>The heart is considered the organ of fire, and its health is crucial, correlating with the lungs, as both are connected in the creation of life according to various ancient texts. It is noted that if heart energy is strong, joy and laughter will follow. Conversely, summer&#39;s heat can lead to fevers and illnesses in the fall, suggesting that imbalances may manifest later.</p>
<p>Thus, the focus is on the balance of fire energy, its seasonal effects, and its implications for health.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>When the fire element is excessive, it must be restrained by water, leading to the pacification of fire energies; thus, it corresponds to the same principle as the rising brightness and proper alignment. When the fire energy is stabilized and the metal energy is unscathed, then the gathering of energy aligns with the nurturing and transforming energies. In the year of the Upper Feather, the sun governs the heavens. The disease of paralysis is attributed to the sun. The Upper Deployment involves the dual fire of the ruler and minister, corresponding to the years of Wuzi, Wuwu, Wuyin, and Wushen when the fire heat is even more intense, causing the gathering of energy to arrive later and resulting in chaotic governance driven by excessive fire. This brings about water energy recovery, hence the appearance of mists and the possibility of rain, ice, and hail, which leads to injury to the heart. </p>
<p>The records of rich abundance are known as broad transformation. With profound virtue and tranquility, it flows smoothly towards fullness. The essence of extreme yin exists within, fostering the growth of things. Smoke and dust are seen hovering over rich earth. Heavy rains occur in due time, with dampness in effect while dry policies are avoided. Its transformation is round and its energy abundant, its governance is calm and its commands thorough. Its movement is moist and accumulative, its virtue gentle, rich, and deep. Its changes cause shock and swift collapse. Its grains include millet and hemp, its livestock comprises cattle and dogs. Its fruits are jujubes and plums, its colors are dark, foundational, and deep green, its tastes are sweet, salty, and sour. Its symbol represents the long summer, its channels connect to the greater yin and yang brightness, its organs are the spleen and kidneys, its pests are worms and lice, its substance is muscle and kernel. Its maladies include abdominal fullness and inability to lift the limbs, with strong winds arriving rapidly; this harms the spleen.</p>
<p>(Note: The excess of earth energy is referred to as rich abundance.)<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>The energy of the earth is abundant and its transformative essence spreads in all directions, thus it is called broad transformation. With thick virtue and the pure essence of earth, it follows nature to be full; this is the fusion of fire and earth. Above the moon, the moist earth governs; hence, in the extreme yin, there is substance, and all things are transformed into existence. The moon represents the utmost yin, where yin energy is substantial, and from this, all things are manifested outwardly. The haze and dust are the essence of the earth. The thick earth is seen between mountains and hills. When heavy rain occurs, the moisture steams upward, ultimately becoming rainfall. &quot;Bi&quot; means to avoid. At the transition from summer to autumn, the moist earth holds sway, leading to an abundance of moisture, hence the dryness of autumn is a result of avoidance. Serenity is the governance of earth, encompassing the regulations of earth&#39;s essence. &quot;Ji&quot; means to gather; when moist, it becomes consolidated and accumulates. Softness and moisture are the virtues of the earth. Tremors may cause abrupt collapse, representing changes in energy. The grains such as millet and hemp, livestock like cattle and dogs, vermin with fur, fruits like jujubes and plums, colors like deep black and gray, and tastes like sweet, salty, and sour, all influence and support one another, leading to transformation. Their channels align with the foot taiyin spleen and foot yangming stomach, and their organs correspond to the spleen and kidneys. When the abdomen is full and the limbs are unable to rise, this is due to the illness of excess moisture. When the earth energy is too strong, the wind returns, and the spleen is harmed in turn. The regulations of solid formation are called gathering and attraction. The heavenly energy is pure, and the earthly energy is clear. Yang energy follows, and yin governs transformation. Dryness executes its order, and things are brought to completion. The gathering of energy is prolific, but transformation is not lasting.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>Its transformation is complete, its essence is refined, its governance is solemn, its decrees are sharp and incisive, its movements are violent and prone to injury, its virtue is like fog and dew, its changes are sharp and chilling. Its grains are rice and millet, its livestock are chickens and horses, its fruits are peaches and apricots, its colors are white, blue, and red, its tastes are spicy, sour, and bitter. Its imagery is autumn, its influences are governed by the Taiyin and Yangming, its organs are the lungs and liver, its insects are those with shells and feathers, its materials have shells and membranes, its ailments include coughing and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Above, it aligns with the Zheng and Shang. Its life is balanced, its illness is coughing. When governance is violent and chaotic, then the name and trees do not flourish; they become soft and brittle, and prolonged conditions can save it, a great fire flows, and intense heat approaches, vines become dry, and evils harm the lungs.</p>
<p>(Note: The year of excessive metal is called &quot;hard and complete.&quot; The autumn season primarily governs the harvest, which is called &quot;harvest and pull.&quot; The weather is clear, the earth&#39;s essence is bright, and the essence of metal is pure. Above Yangming, the dryness governs it; thus, the Yin metal transforms at the top while the Yangming essence follows below. Autumn governs the harvest; hence, dryness dictates its governance, as things are managed in harvest. Autumn mainly governs harvest and late summer governs transformation, where harvesting energy is deployed early, causing transformation to be incomplete. Completion pertains to the transformation of autumn, refinement pertains to the essence of metal. Seriousness pertains to the governance of metal; sharpness is the decree of metal. Violent injury leads to the harm to muscles, while sores are skin diseases. Mist and dew symbolize auspicious air. The sharp and chilling atmosphere represents change.)<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>In that valley, there are rice and millet, chickens and horses among livestock, peaches and apricots among fruits, and insects such as crickets. The shells of various items, colors of white, green, and red, flavors of spicy, sour, and bitter—all interact, generating and transforming life. Its imagery corresponds to autumn, aligning with the hand&#39;s yin of the lung and the hand&#39;s yang of the large intestine, harmonizing with the organs of the lung and liver. The ailments present as wheezing and gasping, with the metal energy being too strong and the lung energy being full. The upper correspondences are related to the lesser yin and lesser yang of fire, specifically the years of Gengzi, Gengwu, Gengyin, and Gengshen—four years. When metal energy is excessive, it is regulated by fire; when metal energy is balanced, it aligns with the same importance as proper commerce. With balanced metal energy, the vitality of wood is not stifled, allowing it to synchronize with the four seasonal energies. The ailment manifests as coughing due to fire injuring the lung. The harshness is overwhelming, causing harm to plants. The emergence of vitality seeks to restore it, which is why great fire flowing westward paradoxically injures the lung.</p>
<p>The passage of time is termed sealing and storing. Cold governs the transformation of matter, while the weather is severe and condensed. Storage systems are deployed and remain hidden, with growth not rising. Its transformation is cold, its energy strong, its governance calm, its decrees flowing and entering, its movements drifting and spilling abundantly. Its virtue is thick and cold, its transformations are ice, snow, frost, and hail; with grains of beans and millet, livestock of pigs and cattle, fruits of chestnuts and jujubes, with colors being black, red, and dark, and flavors being salty, bitter, and sweet. Its imagery is winter, corresponding with the foot&#39;s lesser yin and greater yang, its organs being the kidney and heart, its insects scaling and creeping. Its substances are moist and full, with the ailment manifesting as bloating, resulting in upward energy and untransformed growth.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>When governance is excessive, it leads to an overwhelming amount of moisture, and when dust and haze converge, heavy rain falls, which harms the kidneys. </p>
<p>(Note: Water&#39;s excess is described as a flowing overflow. Winter represents concealment, known as sealing and storing. Cold air governs transformation, causing the weather to be severe and still. Water orders the distribution, hence fire&#39;s influence does not manifest. The piercing cold transforms the stiff, cold air, which flows into the water&#39;s nature. The overwhelming flow and discharge of water represent disease. The cold&#39;s chilling atmosphere demonstrates the harmonious nature of cold air. Ice, snow, frost, and hail are extreme forms of cold that undergo changes. The grains such as beans and millet, livestock like pigs and cattle, fruits like chestnuts and jujubes, and insects like scales are nourished and bathed, exhibiting dark colors and flavors—each interacting and transforming together. This imagery corresponds to winter, and it relates to the Kidney and Bladder meridians in Traditional Chinese Medicine, aligning with the heart and kidney organs. The disease of swelling occurs when water is abundant and dominates the earth. The rising moisture signifies an ascent to the sun, with cold water governing the heavens, specifically the years of Bing Chen and Bing Xu. The excess of water prevents the transformation by fire. When water governance is excessive, earth will recover from it. Dust and haze arise from wet air rising. The interaction of air means that dampness ascends to form clouds, while falling weather results in rain. When heavy rain occurs, the kidneys are adversely affected.)</p>
<p>Thus it is said: If one does not maintain virtue consistently, what is conquered will return; if governance adheres to principles regularly, what is conquered will integrate harmoniously. This is the essence of it.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>The text summarizes the five elemental energies, stating that if one relies on strength without maintaining virtue, the energies one has overcome will return, which is referred to as &quot;being insulted in retaliation,&quot; leading to a diminished sense of fear. However, if governance is peaceful and each adheres to their principles, the energies one has overcome will be assimilated. This assimilation is akin to the transformation in spring when the melodies of nature resonate, resulting in the clear and cool governance of autumn.</p>
<p>The Emperor asks: The heavens are insufficient in the northwest, where it is cold on the left and cool on the right; the earth is insufficient in the southeast, where it is hot on the right and warm on the left. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>It is noted that as there are yin and yang in heaven, there are also yin and yang on the earth, thus discussing the five movements of heaven and the four directions of the earth. The left being cold and the right cool, as well as the right being hot and the left warm, stem from the hexagrams of the later heaven. The hexagrams of the later heaven are positioned with Li (fire) in the south and Kan (water) in the north, with Zhen (thunder) in the east and Dui (lake) in the west. Because of this arrangement of heaven and earth, the four directions emerge.</p>
<p>Qibo replies: The energies of yin and yang, and the principles of high and low, are merely distinctions of more and less.</p>
<p>The energies of yin and yang refer to the cold and hot energies present in the four directions. The shapes of high and low refer to the earth having elevations and depressions. The terms &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot; refer to the four symbols, which differ according to the energies of the four directions.</p>
<p>The southeast is yang. Yang denotes that its essence descends below, thus it is hot on the right and warm on the left. The northwest is yin. Yin denotes that its essence is revered above, thus it is cold on the left and cool on the right. Consequently, the earth has elevations and depressions, while the energies exhibit warmth and coolness; the higher areas experience cold energies, while the lower areas experience hot energies.</p>
<p>The essence referred to is the refined water born from the unity of heaven.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>The weather is influenced by changes, and the essence flows between heaven and earth. Therefore, the theory of the correspondence between yin and yang states that heaven has essence, and earth has form. Heaven represents yang while essence represents yin; the cycle of yin and yang revolves up and down. When essence descends below, yang energy rises above, thus it is hot on the right and warm on the left. When the yin essence is sustained above, yang energy is stored below, hence it is cold on the left and cool on the right. The northwest is high, and the southeast is low; therefore, the high places have cold energy, while the lower places have hot energy. </p>
<p>Thus, those exposed to cold and coolness suffer from swelling, while those in warmth and heat suffer from sores. When one drains excess, swelling subsides; when one sweats, sores heal. This reflects the common principles of the opening and closing of the pores, differing in their nature of abundance and scarcity. </p>
<p>This discussion concerns the rise and fall of essence and energy. In cold and cool environments, the yin energy ascends while yang energy is stored below, leading to much swelling, referred to as &quot;disease due to internal cold.&quot; In contrast, when in warm and hot places, yin energy descends while yang energy ascends, resulting in many sores, known to be related to fire, such as painful and itchy sores. Therefore, when one drains, yin energy descends, and yang energy rises, thus resolving swelling. Sweating, being a yin fluid, causes yin fluid to rise and yang energy to descend, leading to the healing of sores. This interplay of essence and energy within the body, their rise and fall, opening and closing, is the natural principle.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>In life, one exists amidst the interplay of the energies of heaven and earth, subject to the differences of cold and heat from the four corners. One should follow these energies and adjust accordingly, and naturally, severe ailments will not arise. The Emperor asked: How is it with longevity and short life? Qibo replied: Yin essence sustains a person&#39;s longevity, while Yang essence leads to a person&#39;s early death. </p>
<p>[Note: Where the Yin essence is preserved, the original energy is firmly stored, thus promoting longevity; where the Yang essence is dispelled, the original Yang is lost outwardly, resulting in many premature deaths. The terms Yin essence and Yang essence suggest that there is essence in the earth and essence in the heavens; in the earth, it is Yin, and in the heavens, it is Yang.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! What about diseases; how should they be treated? Qibo replied: The energy from the northwest is dispersive and cold; the energy from the southeast is gathering and warm. This is what is meant by treating the same disease in different ways.</p>
<p>[Note: The western and northern energy is cold, and when it is firmly established externally, heat builds up internally, hence it is appropriate to disperse the external cold and cool the internal heat. The southeastern energy is warm, and the Yang energy leaks outward, causing internal energy to be weak and cold; therefore, it is suitable to gather the original Yang and warm the cold within. Although the diseases are the same, the treatment methods differ.]</p>
<p>Hence it is said: For cold and cool energies, treat with cold and cool methods, using water to moisten. For warm and hot energies, treat with warm and hot methods, strengthening internal retention. One must align with the energy to achieve balance. The opposite is true for uninvited conditions.</p>
<p>[Note: The cold and cool energies of the northwest cause the Yang heat within a person to become obstructed, thus it should be treated with cold and cool interventions. The process of using water to moisten means to use hot liquid to soak, inducing sweat, opening pores to allow Yang energy to flow freely.]<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>In the southeastern regions, the climate is warm and hot, which causes people&#39;s pores to open and the yang energy to disperse outward. Therefore, one should treat these conditions with warmth, strengthening the primordial yang to ensure it remains within. What is closed should be opened, and what is opened should be closed. The rising and expanding qi should be collected and stored; the qi that is stored should rise and disperse. It is essential to achieve harmony in qi to achieve balance. For people in the northwest suffering from cold pathogens but feeling warmth, they should also be treated with warmth; conversely, for those in the southeast suffering from heat pathogens but feeling cold, they should be treated with coolness. What is termed &quot;false&quot; is indeed the opposite.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Good! If the energy of a region gives rise to different life spans, what is the reason for this? Qi Bo replied: It is due to the principles of elevation and depression, caused by the topography. High places are governed by yin energy, while low and wet places are governed by yang energy. The strong yang is associated with pre-natal factors, while the strong yin is associated with post-natal factors. This is the consistent rule of geography and the way of transformation and generation.</p>
<p>This further discusses the qi of a specific region, recognizing the differences of yin and yang, cold and hot. In high and lofty mountainous areas, there tends to be more cold and yin; in low and damp areas, there tends to be more heat and yang. The strong yang corresponds to the seasonal qi that arrives at the first instance; the strong yin corresponds to the seasonal qi that arrives later. The coming and going of cold and heat all derive from the earth. This differentiation in geography regarding elevation, density, and the regularity of yin and yang entering and exiting is inherent. The way of transformation and generation refers to the qi of growth, transformation, storage, and collection.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>When treated with Yang energy, it promotes growth; when treated with Yin energy, it promotes storage. The Emperor asked: Is there a difference between longevity and early death? Qi Bo replied: Those with abundant energy live long, while those with deficient energy do not. This is due to the differences in the Earth’s characteristics. The smaller ones have minor differences, while the larger ones have significant differences.</p>
<p>Thus, those who heal must understand the heavenly principles and geographical distinctions, the changes of Yin and Yang, the order of energy, as well as the longevity and early death of people and the cycles of life and transformation, in order to comprehend the physical and energetic conditions of individuals. The Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
<p>The heavenly principles refer to the transformative patterns of Heaven. Geographical distinctions refer to the four directions of the Earth. The changes of Yin and Yang concern the excesses and deficiencies of the five movements and six energies, and the balance and imbalance they create. The order of energy refers to the notion that excess indicates pre-Heaven qualities, while deficiency indicates post-Heaven qualities. Those with lower and weaker qualities are pre-Heaven, while those with high and robust qualities are post-Heaven. To understand people&#39;s longevity based on heavenly influences and the dynamics of energy, is to know their physical conditions.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot;: When form and energy are in harmony, there is longevity; when they are not, there is early death. When skin and flesh are connected, there is longevity; when they are not, there is early death. When blood and energy prevail in the channels over form, there is longevity; when they do not, there is early death. When the form is full and the skin is loose, there is longevity; when the form is full and the skin is tense, there is early death. When the energy prevails over the form in a balanced person, there is longevity; when the form and flesh weaken and energy prevails, there is death. When the form prevails over energy, it is perilous.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Integration of Ancient and Modern Texts: Complete Records of the Medical Section, Volume One Hundred Thirteen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Regulation of Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Constants of Governance [Part Two]</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In years when there is no illness, why do the bodily energies not respond as they should? Qi Bo replied: It is governed by the celestial weather; there are sources of Qi. [Note: The following three sections discuss the five movements of heaven and the five directions of earth, as well as the six energies of the heavenly overseer governed by springs, which interrelate. Years without illness are not determined by the five movements of heaven and the five directions of earth. Bodily energies are those of the five organs, in accordance with the five movements and five elements. &quot;Not responding and not being used&quot; refers to not being utilized according to the five movements; this is due to the influence of the energies administered by the heavenly overseer, from which the bodily energies derive.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear the conclusion! Qi Bo replied: In the lesser yang, the heavenly overseer, the fire energy descends, the lung energy ascends; the white represents the metal element which is utilized when weeds are afflicted. Fire appears scorched, metal is worn and drained; during the great heat period, there are coughs, sneezes, nasal congestion, oral ulcers, and swelling from cold and heat. [Note: According to the record of Jin Ping, its organ is the lung, its color is white, and it corresponds to metal, all of which reflect the use of the five movements and five elements. The ascent refers to the descent of the heavenly overseer&#39;s energy, fearing its overpowering nature and yielding to it. The energies of the five movements are rooted within and circulated externally; the energies administered by the heavenly overseer are positioned above and descend below. The lung energy ascends, the white corresponds to metal, both aligning with the energy of the heavenly overseer, while not being used by the five movements.]<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>When metal is used in the upper regions, then the grass and trees will suffer in the lower regions. When metal transforms from fire, it undergoes change and depletion. Symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion are all indications of lung disease; oral ulcers, chills, fever, and swelling are signs of heat. This is the movement and energy of metal, which reacts with transformation from fire. This discussion of movement and energy is, above, aligned with the transformation of heaven and, with regard to the yearly cycles of heaven, there are only minor distinctions.</p>
<p>The wind moves across the ground, dust and sand are lifted and fly; this leads to symptoms like heart pain, stomach pain, and reversal of qi, causing obstruction. Its main cause is rapidity. </p>
<p>(Note: In the section where lesser yang governs heaven, the greater yin is at the spring; that is why the wind moves across the ground. When the wind prevails, movement occurs, hence dust and sand are lifted. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot Sutra&quot; states that the diseases stemming from the heart&#39;s pericardium which relate to the greater yin include heart pain, worry, and stomach discomfort, indicating that wood is overcoming upwards. The center is earth, when the middle of the stomach is obstructed, it causes upward rebounds. Wind energy is swift, thus its main focus is rapidity.)</p>
<p>When the greater yang governs heaven, the drying energy descends, while the liver energy ascends. The trees flourish and stand tall, then earth suffers; the storms approach, trees are cut down, grasses wither, causing side pain, red eyes, instability, trembling, and weakness in the muscles, making prolonged standing difficult.</p>
<p>(Note: Standing refers to the body of wood; it generally means that the essence of the five elements is on earth, while its function ascends towards heaven. When wood is transformed from heaven, earth suffers. The energy of metal descends, causing trees to be cut and grasses to wither. Symptoms like side pain, red eyes, trembling, and muscle atrophy all indicate diseases related to liver wood.)<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>When extreme heat arrives, the earth becomes hot, the yang energy surges, urine changes, chills and fevers resemble intermittent malaria, and if severe, there is heart pain. Fire acts upon the withered, flowing water does not freeze, and hibernating insects emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the yang ming rules the heavens, then the shaoyin lord’s fire resides in the spring, thus when extreme heat comes, the earth becomes hot. With excessive yang heat, urine changes, and chills and fevers resemble intermittent malaria, hence it is said that summer injuries from heat will lead to autumn fevers. Heart pain arises from fire being rampant within. The term &quot;withered&quot; refers to the time when fire acts upon withered plants, hence flowing water does not freeze, and hibernating insects do not hide.</p>
<p>When the sun rules the heavens, cold energy descends, and heart energy rises, the fire begins to ignite. The metal suffers, and during the cold and clear time, if excessive, water freezes. The fire energy becomes high and bright, the heart is hot and restless, the throat feels dry and thirsty, sneezing produces joy or sadness, and there are frequent yawns, with the heat energy running rampant. Cold then returns, frost does not fall at the proper time, one becomes forgetful, and if severe, there is heart pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Brightness refers to the function of fire. When cold energy descends and heart energy rises, fire naturally flares upwards, while water naturally sinks down, hence fire appears high and bright, while the water becomes cold and solid at the bottom. Water in the earth corresponds to cold in the heavens; the fire&#39;s energy runs rampant upwards, hence frost and cold are restored.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>When the heart is heated and troubled, the throat feels dry and thirsty, as the fire rises above. The lungs are the cover of the heart. Sneezing and sadness indicate the heat of fire burning the metal. Fire is yang, and water is yin; when the balance is lacking, yang rises while yin descends. Those who forget easily are harmed by cold, leading to injuries to the spirit and energy.</p>
<p>Earth is nurturing, and water is abundant; when cold guests arrive, hidden yin transforms, and dampness alters matter. Drinking water causes fullness but not hunger, the skin and flesh are strained, and the meridians are obstructed, leading to swelling and sores on the back.</p>
<p>Note: When the sun governs the heavens, the yin moisture from the earth is found in springs, hence the earth is nurturing. Water being abundant means that it can be controlled by the earth. In the years of the Earth Dog, when the sun governs, the cold water brings its guest energy influencing the three vital energies, and the main energy associated with wet earth governs the four vital energies; thus it is said cold guests have arrived. The transformation of hidden yin refers to the time when summer transitions, with water and moisture combining but without the nurturing of fire and earth, leading to alterations due to dampness. Drinking water to the point of fullness and suffering from strained skin and flesh are both the result of water and dampness illness. The swelling on the back arises from sores appearing there. The classic text states that all swellings and boils arise from the transformation of cold energy. The sun&#39;s cold water governs while the meridians circulate along the back, causing swelling there.</p>
<p>When the jueyin influences the heavens, the wind energy descends, and the spleen energy rises, leading the earth to flourish and emerge yellow. Water then becomes hazardous; the earth undergoes change, the body feels heavy, the muscles weaken, appetite decreases, and the mouth feels strange. Winds traverse the vast void, clouds and objects sway, eyes shift, and ears ring.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The record of the earth is related to the earth element itself; its organ is the spleen, and its color is yellow. The earth is also elevated as the body of the earth is rich and thick below. The appearance of yellow indicates that the earth draws nourishment from above, from heaven. When the earth is transformed by wood, it receives the overpowering influence, thus the earth undergoes changes, resulting in the heavy body and reduced spleen illnesses. The turning of the eyes and ringing in the ears is due to wind invading from above.</p>
<p>Fire unleashes its ferocity, and the earth experiences heat; the excessive heat causes fiery vapors to consume, the red earth generates below, hibernating insects are often seen, and flowing water does not freeze, indicating a rapid onset of phase.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The wind and wood of the Jueyin control the heavens, while the Shaoyang fire exists in the springs; wood and fire mutually generate, hence fire unleashing its ferocity. The statement about the heat of the earth implies that the Taiyin damp earth is also hot and humid. The description of &quot;red earth below&quot; indicates that the leaves of the trees, though lush, also wither and fall. During the severe winter storage time, hibernating insects are not visible, and flowing water does not freeze; the nature of fire is rapid, and the Shaoyang governs the pivot, hence its quick onset.</p>
<p>The Shaoyin governs the heavens, with heat descending, lung energy circulating upward, the white aspect pertains to gold use; plants suffer ailments, coughs, and manifestations of cold and heat, sneezing, and nasal blockage; extreme heat flows throughout, leading to sores and burns, and gold melts with flowing stone.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ailments of plants arise from extreme heat flowing, which is worse than in spring and summer. The melting gold and flowing stone indicate excessive heat invading from autumn and winter.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>The essence of heavenly influence is governed, though it presides over half a year prior, yet it also commands the entirety of the year. The essence of springs governs after half a year. Therefore, it is said that when the wind moves over the earth, it denotes heat emanating from the ground; as moist air transforms substances, all arise from the long summer.</p>
<p>The earth becomes dry; cold and sorrowful conditions emerge, causing lateral pain and heavy sighing. The process of gradual cooling occurs, causing changes in grass and trees.</p>
<p>[Note: When the lesser yin governs the heavens, the active yang metal becomes dry at the springs, hence the earth is dry, with cold and sorrowful conditions arising, a manifestation of clear and cool energy. Lateral pain causing heavy sighing reflects diseases of the liver and gallbladder. The process of gradual cooling results in changes in grass and trees.]</p>
<p>When the greater yin governs the heavens, moist air descends while the energy of the kidneys ascends, resulting in the emergence of dark waters, clouds, and rain. There is obstruction in the chest, impotence, great depletion of energy, leading to difficulty in rising or moving; at this time, there can be lower back pain, stiffness in movement, and counterflow.</p>
<p>[Note: Dark waters manifest from movement, leading to bodily changes. Clouds and rain result from the transformation of moist earth. Obstruction in the chest indicates upward water energy. Impotence arises from depletion in the kidneys. Yang energy is generated from the yin of the kidneys and moves to the surface; thus, with great depletion of kidney energy, yang energy fails to rise or function, leading to counterflow in the limbs. During the winter season, the kidneys govern energy, causing lower back pain, difficulty in movement due to energy rising and significant depletion below.]<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The earth conceals its yin, the great cold approaches, insects awake early from hibernation. There is pain beneath the heart, the ground cracks and the ice becomes hard, there is pain in the lower abdomen, and food is harmful at this time. When metal is involved, it ceases. Water increases its taste and becomes salty; when water flows, it diminishes. </p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;heart below&quot; refers to the imbalance between the water and fire energies, as they do not interact. The cracking ground and hard ice indicate the variability of cold water. Pain in the lower abdomen suggests issues with the kidneys. Food being harmful means that water dominates the earth. The kidneys are fundamental, while the lungs are secondary, both accumulating water. When metal is involved, water energy rises to the lungs and ceases activity there. The heart&#39;s energy connects to the tongue, and harmony within the heart allows for understanding the five flavors. When water increases its flavor and becomes salty, it is an indication that excess water is rising to affect the heart. This condition indicates excess water energy leads to disease; thus, with water flowing, the illness decreases. </p>
<p>The discussion above pertains to the energies of the five movements, influenced by the weather; the energies of the five organs and five elements respond to this and transform in accordance with nature.) </p>
<p>The emperor asked: &quot;In years where there is fetal energy but no growth, what energies are responsible for this?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The six energies have five categories, with mutual overcoming and restraining at play. Similar energies increase, while different energies diminish. This is the way of heaven and earth, the constant pattern of life and transformation.&quot;<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>This text discusses the relationship between the Six Qi (energies) and the Five Movements (elements) in the context of birth and growth of various insects, emphasizing how these energies influence the vitality or decline of different species based on their compatibility.</p>
<p>Thus, the Taiyin governs the heavens: the hairy caterpillar grows, the feathered insect develops, but the armored insect does not mature. </p>
<p>When the Taiyin governs the heavens, the Shaoyang is at the spring, thus the hairy caterpillar remains still while the feathered insect develops. &quot;Still&quot; refers to the state of being tranquil, allowing for growth; the &quot;armored insect does not mature&quot; indicates that in the years Gui Si and Gui Hai, the victory of fire overpowers and hinders the development of metal insects.</p>
<p>In the spring, the hairy caterpillar grows, the naked insect diminishes, and the feathered insect does not develop. </p>
<p>Here, the Taiyin is in spring, allowing the hairy caterpillar to thrive. Wood overcomes earth, leading to the decline of the naked insect. The text notes that the earth&#39;s energy suppresses itself. The non-development of the feathered insect refers to the years Bing Yin and Bing Shen, which experience the overpowering of water, hence, fire insects do not develop.</p>

<p>When the Shaoyin governs the heavens, the Yangming appears at the spring, hence the feathered insect remains still while the armored insect develops. The non-maturing of the hairy caterpillar means that in the years Geng Zi and Geng Wu, the dominance of metal restricts the growth of wood insects.</p>

The Lesser Yin is at the spring, signifying the years governed by Yangming, such as in the years of Gui Mao and Gui You, where the fire&#39;s vigor prevails, leading to the depletion of armored insects and hence the statement about the depletion of armored insects not breeding. This implies that when depletion occurs, the defeated are weak, but if they do not breed, the overcoming is significant.</p>

Thus, the governing energy is subject to control, and the annual cycles give birth to phenomena.</p>
<p>The governing energy refers to the Five Movements being the masters of the Five Energies. The annual cycle, half of the year prior is led by atmospheric conditions; half of the year afterwards is governed by terrestrial conditions. The heavens regulate the six energies to establish the annual cycle, each energy has its generative qualities, and thus the Five Movements have their limits, leading to cases of infertility and incompletion. </p>
<p>The earth&#39;s energy controls what it can overcome, while the heavens regulate over itself. Heaven governs color, and earth governs form. Each of the five types of decline and growth corresponds with its appropriate energy. Therefore, there are cases of pregnancy without result, and treatments that are incomplete; this is the norm of energy. </p>
<p>As for the earth&#39;s energy controlling what it can overcome, this is exemplified by the Liver and its connection to certain worms; likewise, the Kidney corresponds with other insects. The control that the earth has over its form is why it is called earth governing form. </p>
<p>The theory states that when the atmosphere is insufficient, the earth&#39;s energy follows; when the earth&#39;s energy is insufficient, the atmosphere follows. The movement lies in between, and remains constant. Thus, the energy of the Five Movements transforms within the realms of heaven and earth, remaining constant and overpowering the energies that govern the heavens. It states that when the Lesser Yang governs the heavens, the fire energy descends, bringing forward the Metal energy. When the Yangming governs the heavens, the dry energy descends, introducing the White energy.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>It is the qi of the heavens, which can also control and overcome one&#39;s own fortune, thereby allowing for the rise of Baiqi, Danqi, Cangqi, and Huangqi. Hence, it is said that heaven controls the colors. All of this pertains to the various victories and generation of the five movements and six qi, each with its own success and failure, and the five categories of flourishing and declining, which follow the appropriate qi. Therefore, there are issues with pregnancy and childbirth when treatment is incomplete; such is the nature of victory and control.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;root in the center&quot; refers to the roots being five externally, thus distinguishing between the transformations of life. There are five qi, five flavors, five colors, five categories, and five appropriateness. </p>
<p>This indicates that the qi of the five movements is rooted in the center, while the transformations related to qi, flavor, color, and category are external. The qi of Cang, Jiao, Dan, Su, and Yuan corresponds to the divisions of the five directions and gives rise to the five elements, aligning with the growth, transformation, and storage of the five qi. Therefore, what is termed &quot;root in the center&quot; is akin to the root of a plant in relation to its branches and leaves: rooted in the center while sprouting outward. </p>
<p>The external roots refer to the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang, which give rise to the growth of plants and insects, each possessing the qi, flavors, colors, and categories of the five. Thus it is said: the distinction of transformation involves five qi and five flavors. The five categories and five appropriateness refer to the various types of insects, each associated with the five elements and the qi that corresponds to it.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>The Emperor said: What does this mean? Qi Bo replied: What is rooted within is called the divine mechanism; when the divine leaves, the mechanism ceases. What is rooted without is called the establishment of qi; when the qi stops, transformation is severed. Thus, each has its own restraint, each has its own triumph, each has its own generation, each has its own completion. Therefore, it is said that without understanding the addition of years and the similarities and differences of qi, one cannot adequately discuss creation and transformation. This is what it means.</p>
<p>[Note: This also clarifies the qi of the five movements, transforming within heaven and earth, with the celestial influencing the springs of qi, circulating beyond heaven and earth; each has its own restraint and triumph, mutually supporting one another. The divine refers to the unmeasurable aspects of yin and yang; the mechanism refers to the rotation of the five movements. The divine manifests in heaven as wind and in earth as wood; in heaven as heat and in earth as fire; in heaven as humidity and in earth as earth; in heaven as dryness and in earth as metal; in heaven as cold and in earth as water. It moves in and out between heaven and earth, causing the birth, growth, aging, and death of all living things. Thus, it is said what is rooted within is called the divine mechanism; when the divine departs, the mechanism ceases. The establishment of qi refers to the rise and fall of the yin and yang qi of heaven and earth, leading to the growth, transformation, and storage of all things. Therefore, it is said what is rooted without is called the establishment of qi; when the qi stops, transformation is severed.]<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>In this world, the five elemental energies rise and fall, entering and exiting, moving continuously without rest. Each has its own mastery and generation, giving rise to all things, and human vitality follows suit. Thus, one cannot fully understand the influences of the five movements and six energies, nor the differences and similarities of excess and deficiency, which are insufficient to describe the processes of life and transformation. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Energy begins and brings forth transformation; when energy disperses, forms arise; when energy spreads, nurturing occurs; and when energy concludes, forms change—its essence is the same. However, the experiences of the five tastes differ in abundance and maturity, leading to variations in their beginning and ending. What is the reason for this? </p>
<p>Qi Bo replied: It is governed by the energies of the earth; without the heavens, there would be no birth, and without the earth, there would be no growth. </p>
<p>[Note: This discussion revolves around the energies of the five movements, which primarily govern the transformation of all things, influenced by the energies of springs; it is not due to the absence of growth from heaven and earth. The term &quot;energy&quot; refers to the transformative energies of the five movements: energy begins and brings forth life, meaning it obtains vital energy; energy disperses and forms arise, meaning it obtains growth energy; energy spreads and nurtures, meaning it obtains transformative energy; and energy concludes and forms change, meaning it senses the energy of storage, where things reach their extreme and transform. These five energies predominantly govern growth, transformation, and storage. From beginning to end, their essence is unified. The transformation through the five tastes is facilitated by the tastes that arise from the transformations of the five movements, which in turn support the earth&#39;s energies.]<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>The energy of the five phases governs transformation and growth, regulated by the energy of the earth, which is why transformation can be rich or thin, and ripening can vary in amount. The Emperor asked: “I wish to understand this principle!” Qibo replied: “The variations of cold, heat, dryness, and humidity lead to different forms of transformation. Therefore, in the case of Shaoyang, where the spring is cold, no toxic elements arise; its flavor is pungent, its remedy is bitter and sour, and its grains are of a blue hue. The cold and heat, dryness and humidity, are the six energies of heaven in springs, different from the transformations governed by the five phases. Thus, the growth and breeding governed by the five phases get regulated by the earth&#39;s energy, resulting in variations in richness and quantity. Toxicity refers to singularity, indicating that when extremes of cold or heat appear, they generate poisonous energies that are excessive. In the case of Shaoyang fire residing in spring, no cold toxicity arises, exemplifying the differing transformations of cold and heat. For instance, in the years of Xin Si and Xin Hai, when the cold water phase is in effect, and Shaoyang is in springtime, the energy of the earth governs, preventing cold toxicity from manifesting, thereby showing the superiority of earth energy over the transformation of phases. The five colors and five flavors are under the governance of the five phases. When Shaoyang governs heaven, the color white corresponds to metal; this color is regulated by heaven, known as &#39;heaven-regulated color.&#39;”<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>In Lesser Yang at the spring, its flavor is pungent, which is a flavor derived from the earth, known as the form regulated by the earth. This is the color and flavor of transformation and movement, adhering to the superior regulation of the heavenly. Therefore, it is said that the five flavors are nourished, referring to the five flavors of transformation and movement, which in turn support the earth&#39;s qi. When Lesser Yang is at the spring, then the utmost Yin governs the heavens, thus it primarily oversees bitterness and acidity, with its grains characterized by &quot;azure&quot; and &quot;cinnabar&quot; being mature, drawing from the qi of heaven and earth, rather than from transformation and movement. </p>
<p>In following the guidelines of balance, its color is white, and its flavor is pungent. For example, when Lesser Yang governs the heavens, the white color reflects heavenly transformation. When Lesser Yang is at the spring, then the pungent flavor draws upon the earth&#39;s qi, a manifestation of the qi of heaven and earth, dominating its transformative energy. As for the utmost Yin overseeing the heavens, if the larvae do not complete, and if the utmost Yin is at the spring, then the feathered insects do not thrive. This is the qi of the five movements, dominating its regulation at the spring. Therefore, it is said that each has its regulation, each has its dominance, each has its birth, and each has its completion, referring to the five movements and six qi, each having its generation; if one encounters dominance, then there is no birth or completion.</p>
<p>When Greater Yang is at the spring, damp toxins do not arise; its flavor is sour, its qi is damp, its treatment is pungent, bitter, and sweet, and its grains are cinnabar and white.</p>
<p>(Note: Greater Yang, being associated with dry metal at the spring, is why damp and toxic substances do not arise. Sour is the flavor of wood.)<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>In the year of Fuhuo, its color is dark green, and its flavor is sour. When it aligns with the years of Renzi and Renwu, the Yangming is at the spring, and the earth&#39;s qi controls it, thus the flavor that comes from the wood&#39;s movement is transformed by the earth, leading to its sour taste. Yangming does not derive from the external signs but reflects the influences of the Taiyin&#39;s moist earth from within, hence its dominant quality is moist, with flavors that are spicy, bitter, and sweet, also deriving from earth&#39;s transformation. The grains that are red and white mature when the Heavenly Controller is at the spring, as mentioned in the lower section regarding annual grains.</p>
<p>When the Sun is at the spring, heat toxins do not arise; its flavor is bitter and its treatment is plain salty, with the grains being dark and hulled. </p>
<p>The Sun&#39;s cold water at the spring prevents the emergence of heat toxins, as cold and heat undergo different transformations. In the years of Guichou and Guwei, the fire governs the movements; fire fears being controlled by water, thus its flavor is bitter and plain, accompanied by sweetness, forming flavors that are plain salty, and its mature grains are predominantly yellow.</p>
<p>When the Jueyin is at the spring, clean toxins do not manifest, its flavor is sweet, its treatment is sour and bitter, with grains being dark red, its qi is focused, and its flavor is pure. </p>
<p>When the Jueyin is at the spring, clean toxins do not arise. The earth fears the control of wood, thus its flavor is sweet.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>The flavors it governs are sour and bitter, and its grains that are primarily blue and red are ripe. The Jueyin does not follow the principles, but instead observes the transformation of Shaoyang&#39;s fire from within, and in the essence of springs, it sees the bitterness and heat it governs; thus, its energy is singular, and its flavor is precise. </p>
<p>In the Shaoyin there is a spring, and cold toxins do not arise; its flavor is pungent, and its treatment is of pungent, bitter, and sweet nature, while its grain is white millet. </p>
<p>(Note: The fire of Shaoyin is at the spring, hence cold toxins do not arise. Metal fears fire&#39;s restraint, thus its flavor is pungent. When Shaoyin is below, Yangming is above. Above Yangming, the drying energy treats it; within, it sees the transformation of Taiyin and Yangming, hence its governed flavors are pungent, bitter, sweet, and also show the flavor of earth. Its grain, mainly white millet, is ripe.)</p>
<p>In the Taiyin there is a spring, and dry toxins do not arise; its flavor is salty, its essence is hot, its treatment is sweet and salty, and its grain is barnyard millet. </p>
<p>(Note: The wet earth of Taiyin in the spring does not produce dry toxins. Water fears the restraint of earth, thus its flavor is salty. When Taiyin is below, the Sun is above, hence its essence is hot; it refers to the Sun following the principles, with flavors derived from earth and essence from heaven. The flavors it governs are sweet and salty, and its grains, primarily barnyard millet, are ripe.)</p>
<p>Through transformation, salt is preserved, energy is singular, thus pungency transforms and both treatments align.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>The explanation here states that the five flavors are related to their respective transformative energies, adhering to the principles of dominance and control. The term &quot;pure transformation&quot; refers to the Yangming being transformed by the moist earth it encounters, where dryness and moisture combine, leading to harmony in transformation. Metal transforms from earth, hence its salty flavor, which should be preserved and not allowed to overflow due to the fear of the Taiyin&#39;s regulation. The concentrated energy of the Jueyin sees the governing energy of the Shaoyang, thus the spicy flavor appears alongside the flavors of sweetness, sourness, and bitterness. Spiciness is influenced by the control of fire, as transformation follows the regulation of fire. Cold, heat, dryness, and moisture are among the six energies found in springs. Sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty are the five flavors related to the five movements. The combination of dryness and moisture&#39;s pure transformation preserves saltiness, while the concentrated energy of fire transforms spiciness, all governed by the energy of the earth, leading flavors to return to energy transformation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said: To supplement the upper and lower aspects, one follows, and to treat them, one goes against their nature, adjusting based on the variations of cold and heat. Thus, the upper and lower are treated accordingly, and the internal and external are addressed in search of imbalances. For those who can be poisoned, a strong remedy is applied, while for those who cannot withstand poison, a mild remedy is used. This is the meaning.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>The text discusses the regulation of vitality (qi) in relation to seasonal changes and environmental influences. It explains that the celestial energy associated with water (represented as the spring energy) can be complemented by sour and bitter flavors to balance its upward and downward movements. It outlines how to address imbalances caused by external winds or internal heat, suggesting that when cold dominates internally, one should treat it with warmth, and when internal heat prevails, it should be countered with coldness.</p>
<p>The process of healing involves assessing the prevailing conditions—whether they are too cold or too hot—and adjusting treatment accordingly. If the energy is strong, it should be moderated; if it is weak, it should be supplemented. The five elemental energies (wuyun) must be harmonized according to their movements, ensuring that any excesses are appropriately managed.</p>
<p>The text also mentions how ailments can manifest based on the relationship between upper and lower energies, or external and internal forces. When illness arises from a discord between these energies, treatments should be tailored to address such oppositions.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>Thus, when the upper side prevails and the lower side reacts, the patient should take from below; when the upper side is defeated and the lower side reacts, the patient should take from above; when the external side prevails and the internal side reacts, the patient should take from the outside. To treat heat with cold, one should use warmth in application. To treat cold with heat, one should apply coolness. To treat warmth with clarity, one should apply coldness. To treat clarity with warmth, one should apply heat. Therefore, one can either dispel or reduce, induce vomiting or purging, tonify or deplete, following the same method for a long time.</p>
<p>[Note: To treat heat with cold and apply warmth in treatment implies that cold nature is incompatible with heat; hence, warmth should be used. The methods of treating heat with cold and treating cold with heat start similarly but end differently. It can break down accumulations, dissolve hardness, harmonize qi, and resolve blockages, which is the method of opposition. To treat warmth with clarity and apply cold, and to treat clarity with warmth and apply heat—this is the proper method. One uses clarity and coolness to treat warmth and heat, and warmth and heat to treat clarity and coolness—this is what is termed the inverse approach, while the proper treatment is as stated.]<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>Eliminate and reduce it; this refers to taking from both the inside and the outside. Spit it out and drain it; this indicates taking from above and below. Supplement and drain; supplement above and below, treating both the upper and lower parts. Chronic conditions refer to diseases of repressed Qi; new conditions arise suddenly from an infectious cause.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: If the disease is internal but not solid or firm, and it gathers and disperses, what should be done? Qi Bo replied: Your question is thorough! For those without accumulation, seek the organ; if it is deficient, supplement it. Use medicine to dispel it, food to nourish it, perform water therapy to induce sweating, and harmonize the inside and outside, so that it can be resolved.</p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the Qi of the five movements as a disease and the methods of treating it. When the disease is internal, it is rooted within. If it is not solid or firm, and it both gathers and disperses, it is related to the movement of the mind between the internal and external. For example, during the transitional phase, the liver is the organ involved with symptoms of urgency and fullness; during another phase concerning transformation, the spleen is the organ related to the condition of no. The Qi of the five movements corresponds to the five organs; therefore, for those without accumulation, one should seek the relevant organ. When the organ&#39;s Qi is deficient, supplement it first with medicine to dispel the evils and follow with food to nourish the upright Qi, conduct water therapy to induce sweating, and harmonize the inside and outside to expel the evils, thus resolving the issue.]<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>The Emperor said: Is there a distinction between poisonous and non-poisonous, and is there a measure for their consumption? Qibo replied: Illness can be old or new, and prescriptions can vary in strength. Whether poisonous or not, there should always be regulation. For severe poison treating illness, six out of ten symptoms are alleviated; for moderate poison, seven out of ten; for mild poison, eight out of ten; and for non-poisonous treatment, nine out of ten symptoms are alleviated. When consuming grains, meats, fruits, and vegetables, one should fully utilize them but avoid excess that harms the body’s balance. If not used entirely, one must proceed according to the proper method.</p>
<p>(Note: The distinction of old and new illness refers to the poison’s ability to harm, and whether it can be overcome. The mention of varying strengths indicates that some prescriptions may require heavier doses while others may only need lighter ones. Poison can be severe or mild, often manifesting as dampness or dryness, thus care is needed in treating illness; stopping treatment at the right moment is essential to avoid harming the body further. Hence, for severe poisons, treatment ceases when six symptoms are alleviated; for moderate poisons at seven; for mild poisons at eight; and even non-poisonous medicines should not be overused, as prolonged use can weaken the body’s energy, which is a natural principle.)<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>When the vital energy increases over a long period, it leads to premature death. The principles of internal energy state that poison attacks the evil, grains are for nourishment, fruits are for assistance, livestock are for benefit, and vegetables are for sustenance. When the flavors and essences are harmonized and consumed together, they help to replenish essence and enhance energy. Therefore, using medicine and stones to treat illness, while grains and meat provide nourishment, can ensure that diseases are completely eradicated without excess that harms the body&#39;s integrity. If the illness does not fully go away, continue to treat and nourish as before.</p>
<p>One must first understand the seasonal energy, without disrupting the harmony of the heavens. Avoid excesses and deficiencies that lead to misfortune for people; do not cause evil nor lose the proper balance, as this would shorten lifespans.</p>
<p>One must recognize the fluctuations of seasonal energy: when it is weak, one should nourish, and when it is strong, one should drain. Nourish by following the natural flow and drain against it, without disrupting the celestial harmony. Avoid excesses and deficiencies that lead to misfortune; repel evil and nurture the proper balance, ensuring no one loses a long life.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked about those who have long-standing illnesses. When their energy continuously declines, and disease remains while they grow weak, what should be done? Qi Bo replied: &quot;Indeed, a profound question from a sage! Transformation cannot be replaced, and timing must not be violated.&quot;<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The channels exist to facilitate flow, and the blood and energy follow suit. To restore what is lacking, one must align with the collective. Nurture and harmonize it; remain still and wait for the right moment. Carefully guard your energy, preventing it from shifting; only then will its form manifest, and vital energy will flourish, leading to the designation of a sage king. Therefore, the great principle states: do not forsake transformation, do not disregard the timing; you must nurture and harmonize, and await the returns; this is what is meant by it. The Emperor said: Good!</p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the human body, which is sustained by the movement of energy. When the spirit departs, mechanisms cease, when energy stops, transformation ends; thus, the spirit and energy must be nurtured. However, the spirit and energy are like the master, while the body is like a vessel. Only when the form and spirit exist together can one complete their natural lifespan, hence the body must be nurtured. The followers of energy refer to the spirit and energy being harmonized. &quot;Unwell and emaciated&quot; indicates that the body is unwell while the form appears thin. &quot;Transformation&quot; refers to the transformative energy of the five movements, while &quot;timing&quot; refers to the dominant seasons of the six qi.]<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>In the spring season, it nourishes the tendons; in summer, it nourishes the blood; in late summer, it nourishes the muscles; in autumn, it nourishes the skin and hair; in winter, it nourishes the bone marrow. The flesh, tendons, and bones of the body are all sustained by the transformations and movements of these seasons, which cannot be replaced. Just as spring air nourishes the tendons, summer air nourishes the blood vessels, late summer air nourishes the muscles, autumn air nourishes the skin and hair, and winter air nourishes the bone marrow. The body’s flesh, tendons, and bones are all nourished by the seasonal airs, which should not be contradicted. </p>
<p>The meridians and vessels are what circulate qi and blood and nourish yin and yang. Blood is the essence of spirit; just as the meridians connect the flow of blood and qi to restore what is deficient in spirit, bringing it back in line with those who have no illness. However, if the spirit is restored but the body is still unwell and remains thin and emaciated, one should focus on nurturing the spirit, harmonizing the qi, and waiting patiently for the right time, carefully guarding the qi and preventing any disruption. When the body receives the seasonal nourishment, it will gradually thrive. This is the fundamental principle of qi and nourishment for the body.</p>
<p>The aspects of nurturing and harmonizing are language for governance, intended for people to align with the harmony of heaven and earth, following the appropriateness of the four seasons to nourish the spirit, qi, and body. This naturally leads to longevity, without an end in sight.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Origins Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: The heavens have five elements governing five positions, which produce cold, heat, dryness, moisture, and wind. </p>
<p>[Note: The five elements of heaven refer to the five energies of red, black, blue, and white. The five positions are the five directions, corresponding to the five elements of the earth. Cold, heat, dryness, moisture, and wind are the six energies of heaven. This means that the five energies of heaven interact through the ten stems; the energies of the ten stems transform the five elements of the earth; and the five elements of the earth produce the six energies of heaven.]</p>
<p>Human beings have five organs that transform into five energies, which generate joy, anger, worry, thought, and fear. </p>
<p>[Note: The five organs arise from the five elements. The five energies are the energies of the five elements: wind, heat, dryness, moisture, and cold. Joy, anger, worry, thought, and fear are the spiritual states of the five organs. In the heavens, they are energies; on the earth, they take shape. Energies and forms interact, giving rise to all things.]<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>Human beings originate from the five elements of the earth, taking on this form, with the five banners of physical manifestation, transforming the five energies, giving rise to the five aspirations, and reconnecting with the celestial phenomena. </p>
<p>Discussion states that the five movements follow one another and are all governed, with the conclusion of the cycle recurring endlessly, which I already understand. I wish to inquire how this relates to the cycles of the three yin and three yang. </p>
<p>[The commentary refers to the six seasonal organs as discussed in various texts. The five movements are as follows: the year of Jia and Ji is the earth movement; the year of Yi and Geng is the metal movement; the year of Bing and Xin is the water movement; the year of Ding and Ren is the wood movement; the year of Wu and Gui is the fire movement. The three yin and three yang are associated with the years: the zi and wu years are governed by Shaoyin; the chou and wei years are governed by Taiyin; the yin and shen years are governed by Shaoyang; the mao and you years are governed by Yangming; the chen and xu years are governed by Taiyang; the si and hai years are governed by Jueyin. The Emperor states that the energies of the five movements succeed one another and that each year is ruled by them.]<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>On the 365th day of the final period, everything follows a cyclical pattern. How does it align with the masters of the three yin and three yang of the year? Ghostly spirits, bowing twice, replied: What a profound question! The five movements of yin and yang are the way of heaven and earth, the framework of all things, the parents of transformation, the origin of life and death, and the abode of the divine. Can one not understand this?</p>
<p>(Note: The ten heavenly stems transform the five earthly elements; the five earthly elements manifest the six qi of the three yin and three yang. Hence, the five movements of yin and yang are deemed the way of heaven and earth. Wang Bing explained: The Way refers to the method of transformation and generation. Framework refers to the principles of growth, transformation, and storage. Parents refer to the origin of the shapes of all things. Origin refers to the fact that life and death all arise from it.)<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>There are beings with physical forms that are not subjected to the influences of the five movements of yin and yang; such a state is unheard of. Why is it that creation does not reach its limit and becomes the origin of all things’ generation and transformation? It is because it is the abode of the divine. However, the gathering and dispersing are unpredictable, and the processes of generation and transformation are infinite; it is not that the divine is incapable of operating! Therefore, the emergence of things is called transformation, and the culmination of things is called change. The unpredictable nature of yin and yang is referred to as the divine, and the application of the divine without limitation is called sagehood.</p>
<p>The &quot;Six Subtleties&quot; states: the emergence of things arises from transformation, while the culmination of things stems from change. The interaction between change and consistency is what leads to success or failure. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constants&quot; states: when qi begins, generation and transformation occur; when qi disperses, forms arise; when qi spreads, growth happens; when qi ends, forms transform. Yin and yang are the principles of heaven and earth. Within yin resides yang, and within yang resides yin; neither can be fully measured. Their influence operates through the four seasons, transforming all things, and cannot be subjected to quantification. Therefore, the function of transformation is:<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>The changes of yin and yang, which are unpredictable, generate all things between heaven and earth, having the greatest function. In heaven, it is the origin; the origin is distant and profound. The way of heaven is distant and profound, with endless transformations. In humans, it is the path; the path is akin to a road. In all daily dealings among things, there is none that does not follow the natural way of heaven and earth. On earth, it is transformation; transformation means life-giving. The nurturing of all things comes from the generation of the earth. Transformations give rise to the five flavors. The five flavors arise from the five elements. Everything with feelings and nature possesses the essence and flavors of the five elements. The way gives birth to wisdom.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>The mind&#39;s clarity is called wisdom; when it can follow the natural principles of heaven, it can distinguish right from wrong naturally, and nothing is left unfulfilled. </p>
<p>The spirit, in its completeness, interacts with the original flow, transforming through encounters with things, and responds to all. In heaven, it manifests as wind; on earth, as wood. In heaven, it manifests as heat; on earth, as fire. In heaven, it manifests as moisture; on earth, as earth. In heaven, it manifests as dryness; on earth, as metal. In heaven, it manifests as cold; on earth, as water. Thus, in heaven, it is qi (vital energy); on earth, it takes shape. The interaction of form and qi brings forth all things.</p>
<p>Wind, cold, heat, dryness, and moisture are the yin and yang of heaven. Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of earth. Therefore, in heaven, it is qi; on earth, it takes shape, and through their interaction, all things manifest.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are the upper and lower realms of all things. </p>
<p>Heaven supports and earth carries, allowing myriad creatures to arise in between. </p>
<p>The left and right are the pathways of yin and yang. </p>
<p>The qi of yin and yang rotates continuously; thus, the left and right refer to the interstitial qi. </p>
<p>Water and fire are the signs of yin and yang. </p>
<p>Heaven generates water, and earth generates fire. Fire is yang, and water is yin. Though yin and yang are not visible, water and fire serve as tangible symbols of their presence. </p>
<p>Metal and wood represent the beginning and end of generation.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>The Wood element governs spring, bringing forth life and giving rise to all things. The Metal element governs autumn, drawing in and completing all things; thus, it represents the beginning and end of creation. </p>
<p>Qi varies in abundance, and forms experience growth and decline. The interplay between above and below creates a cycle of gain and loss. In Heaven, there is qi, which varies in quantity; on Earth, forms manifest which experience growth and decline. The interactions between above and below reveal the extremes and deficiencies of qi clearly.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;I wish to understand the timing governed by the five phases. How does it work?&quot; </p>
<p>Gui Yu Qu replied: &quot;The five qi operate with designated periods; they are not limited to just one time frame.&quot; </p>
<p>This means that the qi of the five phases each complete their cycle within three hundred sixty-five days. With each cycle ending and beginning anew, the governing of time is not solely theirs. The five phases govern seasons, reflecting the cold, heat, warmth, and coolness of the four seasons, while the governance of the years pertains to the excess or deficiency of the five elements.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;Please explain this further!&quot; Gui Yu Qu responded: &quot;I have compiled from the &#39;Taishi Tianyuan Ce&#39;, which states: &#39;The great void is vast, establishing the foundation of transformation and origin.&#39; </p>
<p>The &#39;Tianyuan Ce&#39; is an ancient text that records the running of the primordialqi of heaven. The great void refers to the realm of formlessness, fully occupying the atmosphere, the palace of spirit and clarity. Vast and boundless describes the immeasurable expanse. Transformation&#39;s origin is the root of creation. </p>
<p>All things originate, and the five phases culminate in the heavens.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>The Five Movements are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. The end of the heavens refers to the daily movement of one degree, where each of the Five Movements rules over a year, corresponding to one three hundred sixty-fifth and four-part degree of the entire heavenly cycle. All things begin to grow through the transformative origin, constantly tied to the movements of the heavens.</p>
<p>The true essence of Qi is the connection between humanity and all things, where the earth resides in the center of heaven, and heaven envelops the earth.</p>
<p>The Nine Stars shine brightly, and the Seven Luminaries revolve around them. The Nine Stars are Tienpeng, Tienrui, Tienchong, Tienfu, Tienqin, Tienxin, Tienren, Tienzhhu, and Tienying, positioned in the heavens and corresponding to the divisions of the nine provinces. The Seven Luminaries are the Sun, Moon, and the Five Planets. &quot;Revolving&quot; refers to the degrees of the heavenly dome, while &quot;moving in a circle&quot; means rotating to follow the heavenly path. </p>
<p>There are Yin and Yang, Softness and Rigidity.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>The Book of Changes states: &quot;Establishing the way of Heaven is called Yin and Yang. Establishing the way of Earth is called softness and hardness.&quot; </p>
<p>When the hidden and the manifest are positioned, cold and heat are relaxed and tightened. </p>
<p>The sun governs the day, while the moon governs the night. The positioning of the hidden and the manifest refers to the establishment of Yin and Yang. The relaxation and tightening of cold and heat signify the ebb and flow of the seasons. </p>
<p>Life nurtures and transforms, and all things are expressed harmoniously. </p>
<p>The Book of Changes says: &quot;Heaven and Earth are intertwined, and all things are refined and pure; this is why life continues unceasingly, transformations are endless, and all things express themselves harmoniously.&quot; </p>
<p>I serve over ten generations, this is what it refers to. </p>
<p>&quot;Ten generations&quot; means from ancestral teachings to the present, it has been ten generations. This is what is meant by accumulating study of the records of the Great Initiation of the Celestial Origins. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;Good! What do you mean by the amount of qi and the waxing and waning of forms?&quot; </p>
<p>Gui Yu Qu replied: &quot;The qi of Yin and Yang each has its own quantity, which is why we say there are three Yin and three Yang. The waxing and waning of forms refers to the governance of the five elements, each having its excesses and deficiencies.&quot; </p>
<p>This refers to Tai Yang, Shao Yang, and Shao Yin, which operate in alignment with the pre-heaven and govern abundance; while Yang Ming, Tai Yin, and Jue Yin operate in accordance with the post-heaven and govern deficiency. This is the quantity of the three Yin and three Yang. The term form refers to the tangible aspect of the five elements.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>The governance of the five forms has its excesses and deficiencies. It is said that each of the five movements governs specific years; for instance, in the years dominated by Ren, the wood movement is excessive, while in the years of Ding, the wood movement is deficient. Similarly, in the years of Wu, the fire movement is excessive, while in the years of Gui, the fire movement is deficient. In the years of Jia, the earth movement is excessive, while in the years of Ji, the earth movement is deficient. In the years of Geng, the metal movement is excessive, while in the years of Yi, the metal movement is deficient. In the years of Bing, the water movement is excessive, while in the years of Xin, the water movement is deficient. Therefore, at the beginning, when there is excess, it proceeds; when there is deficiency, it follows after. When there is deficiency, it proceeds, and the excess follows.</p>
<p>Understanding how to respond and follow, one can make predictions regarding qi. The term &quot;beginning&quot; refers to the initiation of the heavenly stems from Jia and the earthly branches from Zi. For example, when the earth movement is excessive in a Jia year, the metal movement in the following Yi year will be deficient; when the lesser Yin is excessive in the Zi year, the greater Yin will be deficient in the Chou year. This is what is meant by &quot;excess leads forward, deficiency follows.&quot; Similarly, when the metal movement is deficient in the Yi year, the water movement in the following Bing year will be excessive; when the greater Yin is deficient in the Chou year, the lesser Yang will be excessive in the Yin year. This illustrates the principle of &quot;deficiency leads forward, excess follows.&quot;</p>
<p>By comprehending the cycles of annual movements, one can establish timing regarding excesses and deficiencies in qi. Responding to Heaven is like the heavenly symbols, adhering to each year is akin to the yearly principles, and the three harmonies lead to governance.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>This text discusses the concept of a &quot;neutral year&quot; where, within a cycle of sixty years, there are years harmonized by celestial symbols. The so-called &quot;celestial symbols&quot; refer to the energies associated with the five elements: in the year of Earth, the Moon is visible; in the year of Fire, both the lesser Yang and lesser Yin are seen; in the year of Metal, the Yangming appears; in the year of Wood, the Jueyin is present; and in the year of Water, the Taiyang is observed. These energies represent the combination of the five elements with the energies of celestial governance, known as heavenly symbols. </p>
<p>The Wood element corresponds to the Rabbit, Fire to the Horse, Earth to the four seasons, Metal to the West, and Water to the Rat. These correspondences align the earthly branches, governing years, and the energies of the five elements; hence, they are termed &quot;combined years.&quot; The &quot;three harmonies&quot; refer to the synergies among the celestial energies, the energies of the five elements, and the governing year&#39;s energies, collectively known as the Grand Unity Celestial Symbol. These are all balanced years, without excess or deficiency.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>The Emperor said: How do the upper and lower realms call upon each other? Gui You Qu replied: The cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven, which are upheld by the three yin and three yang. The wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of the earth, which correspond to growth, transformation, and storage below.</p>
<p>[Note: The cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire are the six energies of heaven. Above the sun, cold energy presides; above the lesser yin, hot energy presides; above the yang brightness, dry energy presides; above the greater yin, humid energy presides; above the lesser yang, wind energy presides; and above the lesser yin, fire energy presides. Thus, the three yin and three yang uphold the six energies of heaven. The wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the five elements of the earth. In spring, wood governs growth; in summer, fire governs maturity; during the long summer, earth governs transformation; in autumn, metal governs harvest; and in winter, water governs storage. Therefore, growth, transformation, and storage respond below to these principles. The five energies of heaven operate on the five elements of the earth; the five elements of the earth present the six energies of heaven. Thus, the mutual calling between upper and lower realms is established, and the energies of the three yin and three yang belong to both heaven and earth. Therefore, it is said later: Heaven has yin and yang; the earth also has yin and yang.]</p>
<p>Heaven uses yang to engender, and yin to nourish; the earth uses yang to eliminate and yin to store.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>The heavens possess yin and yang, and so does the earth. The five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water represent the yin and yang of the earth. They give rise to life, promote growth, transform, and store; thus, within yang, there is yin, and within yin, there is yang. This reflects that the earth also has the three types of yin and three types of yang. Wind, cold, heat, moisture, dryness, and fire represent the three types of yin and yang from above, illustrating that the heavens embody yin and yang. The five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water reflect the yin and yang of the earth, corresponding to growth, transformation, and storage. Heaven is yang, yet it contains the three types of yin and yang, meaning there is yin within yang; the earth is yin, yet it also possesses the three types of yin and yang, meaning there is yang within yin.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br>To understand the yin and yang of heaven and earth, one should recognize that the qi of heaven moves without ceasing, hence it shifts to the right every five years; the qi of earth remains still and maintains its position, therefore it circles back every six periods. </p>
<p>The qi of heaven refers to the essence of various colors and elements, which moves without end. The shift to the right every five years pertains to the transition from Jia to Yi, Yi to Bing, Bing to Ding, and Ding to Wu, marking the completion of the qi of the Five Movements, after which it restarts. The qi of earth refers to the essences of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Its stillness and preservation of position lead to the cyclical returns every six years, starting from the Rat to the Ox, then to the Tiger, completing six years, and at the year of the Horse, it begins anew with the lesser yin.</p>
<p>Movement and stillness summon each other, the upper and lower realms harmonize, and yin and yang intertwine, thus transformation arises from life. </p>
<p>The interaction of movement and stillness refers to the mutual influence of the qi of heaven and earth. The upper and lower realms align as the five qi of heaven control the five elements of earth; the wood, fire, earth, metal, and water of earth are regulated by the six qi of heaven.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>Thus, heaven is marked by six and earth by five; heaven with six and earth with five, where yin and yang interweave, giving rise to the cycles of thirty years as one era and sixty years as one complete cycle. The Emperor asked: &quot;Is there a numerical system for the upper and lower cycles?&quot; Guiyu Qu replied: &quot;Heaven is divided into six for its seasons, and earth into five for its forms. The cycle of the heavens consists of six periods as one complete set; the completion of the earthly cycle consists of five years as one rotation. The lord fire brings brightness, and the mutual fire takes its position.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The annotations explain that the upper and lower cycles refer to the heavenly stems and earthly branches, where five and six come together. Each thirty years constitutes an era, and each sixty years constitutes a cycle. Heaven is marked by six in accordance with the three yin and three yang seasons. Earth is marked by five according to the positions of the five elements. The heavenly cycle consists of the twelve zodiac signs, with each associated with yin or yang and ruling elements.)<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br>The ultimate record of the earth is governed by the cycles of the Five Elements: Jia controls the earth&#39;s movement, Yi governs metal&#39;s movement, Bing oversees water&#39;s movement, Ding manages wood&#39;s movement, and Wu presides over fire&#39;s movement. The five years represent one cycle of the Five Elements. Thus, the ruler of fire shines brightly in the heavens, while the fire below holds its position. This indicates that the earth is shaped by one fire into the Five Elements, and the heavens are formed by two fires into the Six Energies.</p>
<p>When the Five and Six come together, the 720 energies form one cycle. In total, after thirty years, there are 1,440 energies, and after sixty years, one complete cycle is achieved. The phenomena of excess and deficiency can all be observed herein.</p>
<p>It is noted that each fifteenth day corresponds to one energy. The combination of the Five Elements and Six Energies governs the years. In one year, there are 24 energies, summing to 720 energies for one cycle. A cycle signifies a small reunion. Indeed, by combining five and six to form thirty, and six and five also equating to thirty, we define thirty years as one reunion. From Jia Zi to Gui Hai, the total of sixty years constitutes one complete cycle. The energies of excess and deficiency can also be observed here.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The teachings of the master concerning the end of heavenly phenomena and the completion of earthly records can be said to be thorough indeed.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br>I wish to hear and preserve this. Above to govern the people, below to cultivate oneself, so that the citizens are enlightened, and there is harmony between those above and below, with virtue and grace flowing downwards, ensuring that descendants have no worries, and passing this on to future generations, unending. Can I hear this?</p>
<p>[Note: The following further clarifies the principles of the Five Movements and Six Qi, which have their governing years, cycling endlessly, ensuring that all under heaven for generations, both descendants and common folk, are as the numbers of heaven and earth&#39;s yin and yang, free from calamities. This reflects the sage&#39;s concern for the people, with virtue and grace flowing without end.]</p>
<p>Gui Yuqu said: The mechanism of the ultimate numbers is subtle and intricate. Its arrival can be seen, its departure can be traced. Those who respect it will prosper, those who disregard it will perish. To act unlawfully for personal gain will surely bring heavenly calamity. Diligently follow the way of heaven; I will speak the true essentials!</p>
<p>[Note: The ultimate numbers refer to the fixed numbers that neither exceed nor fall short. The mechanism denotes taking action ahead of time. The movements of qi are very subtle; if one can reflect on the past qi, then the incoming can be known.]<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br>If one shows reverence and fear, then calamities can be avoided; if one is careless and indifferent, one will surely suffer heavenly disasters. The term &quot;unrighteous&quot; refers to the failure to cultivate the way of life. &quot;Acting privately&quot; signifies indulging in desires. The &quot;true intent&quot; refers to the essential path of ultimate truth. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. It is said that one who begins must understand the end, and one who speaks of the near must know the distant. Therefore, when the utmost principles are reached, the way remains clear and unconfused; this is what is meant by clarity. I hope the Master will elaborate on this, making it orderly, simple yet comprehensive, enduring yet unbroken, easy to apply yet hard to forget, forming a guiding principle. Regarding the essential principles, I wish to hear everything about them!</p>
<p>[Note: This refers to the way of yin and yang, from beginning to end, from near to far, simple and clear, easy yet difficult, orderly and reasoned, with structure and guidelines.]</p>
<p>Gui Yu Qu said: Your questioning is truly illuminating! The way is indeed clear! Just as the drum responds to the striking, so too does the echo respond to the sound. </p>
<p>[Note: This expresses the clarity of the yin and yang way, which can be understood like the resonance of a drum; there is no instance where they do not correspond.]<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>I have heard: In the years of Ji and Geng, the influence of the scholar&#39;s fortune is dominant; in the years of Bing and Xin, the influence of metal is dominant; in the years of Ding and Ren, the influence of wood is dominant; in the years of Wu and Gui, the influence of fire is dominant. The &quot;influence&quot; refers to the five energies succeeding one another and all being governed. The Emperor asked: Regarding the three Yin and three Yang, how do they combine? Gui Yu Qu replied: In the years of Zi and Wu, the presence of Shao Yin is seen above; in the years of Chou and Wei, the presence of Tai Yin is seen above; in the years of Yin and Shen, the presence of Shao Yang is seen above; in the years of Mao and You, the presence of Yang Ming is seen above; in the years of Chen and Xu, the presence of Tai Yang is seen above; in the years of Si and Hai, the presence of Jue Yin is seen above. Shao Yin is referred to as the &quot;mark&quot;; Jue Yin is referred to as the &quot;end.&quot; This combination involves the five influences merging with the six energies, as well as the heavenly stems merging with the earthly branches. Zi and Wu represent the lord of Shao Yin fire.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>The ruler is supreme, therefore the Lesser Yin is regarded as the beginning and is marked above. The Jue Yin represents the limit of Yin, which is why it is seen as the end; when Yin is at its peak, the offspring of one Yang re-emerges. Above Jue Yin, the Qi of wind presides; above Lesser Yin, the Qi of heat presides; above Greater Yin, the Qi of dampness presides; above Lesser Yang, the Qi of mutual fire presides; above Yang Ming, the Qi of dryness presides; above Tai Yang, the Qi of cold presides. This is called the foundation and is referred to as the Six Origins. </p>
<p>In explanation, the Six Origins refer to the six Qi of three Yin and three Yang in heaven, and likewise in the earth. Heaven and earth are in a harmonious state, mutually responding to each other, which is why the six Qi govern heaven, and the six Qi are present in springs. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;The Dao is so illuminating! The discussion is so clear! Please inscribe this on a jade tablet, store it in a golden chest, and title it &#39;Chronicles of the Heavenly Origins&#39;.&quot; </p>
<p>In explanation, inscribing on a jade tablet and storing it in a golden chest serves as a sign of permanence and value.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br><strong>The Gate of Luck</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yellow Emperor’s Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Six Origins and Their Principles [Part One]</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;The six transformations and the six changes, how do they relate to the predominance and subjugation of excess and order? I understand the sequences of sweet, bitter, pungent, salty, sour, and bland. What else should I know?&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The six transformations refer to the six climatic influences presided over by the heavens. The six changes refer to the changes brought about by the predominance and subjugation of the five energies of the seasons, which do not fully govern each year. The sweet, bitter, pungent, salty, sour, and bland refer to the five flavors that aid in the prevailing generation and subjugation.]</p>
<p>The five energies can either follow the influences of the heavens or resist them, arise from the heavens and counter the energies of the earth, or arise from the energies of the earth and counter the influences of the heavens. Sometimes they harmonize, and sometimes they do not. I have yet to understand this matter fully. I wish to comprehend the principles from the heavens and the regulations of the earth, harmonize their influences, and adjust their transformations so that the upper and lower realms align in virtue, with no rivalry in order. The rise and fall of the heavens and the earth must not deviate from appropriateness. When the five energies circulate, their governance must not be disrupted. How do we adjust their true flavors when faced with opposition? </p>
<p>[Note: The five energies refer to the transformative influences of the five elements.]<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br>There are situations influenced by the five qi, which involve harmony, clarity, and the preparation for transformation, as discussed in the &quot;Suwen&quot; under the theory of qi exchanges and changes. It is important to consider the balance and tranquility of the seasons, where the five movements are harmonious, and there is no conflict with the six qi. In certain years, such as the Year of Bingzi and the Year of Bingwu, the fire movement governs the heavens while the water movement prevails; in the Years of Jiachen and Jiaxu, the water movement governs the heavens while the earth movement prevails. </p>
<p>Qi can either be influenced by the heavens or by the earth, with three cases where it is excessive and matches heavenly transformations, and three cases where it is insufficient yet matches. Similarly, there are three cases where it is excessive and matches earthly transformations, and three cases where it is insufficient and matches. All of these twenty-four years align with the heavenly influences and correspond with the earthly qi. If there is a reversal of the earthly qi or the heavenly qi, excluding the years designated by the heavenly symbols, it does not align with the qi that governs in the springs. </p>
<p>Whether qi is harmonious or not corresponds with the seasonal influences, such as the warming winds of spring, the heat of summer, the clear dew of autumn, the rainy periods of late summer, and the ice and snow of winter—these represent the guest qi matching the seasonal qi. If the governing qi is deficient and the guest qi prevails, this indicates a mismatch between the guest qi and seasonal qi. </p>
<p>The heavenly cycles conform to the earthly principles, facilitating harmony between upper and lower realms, without disruption of order, ensuring that the qi governing the heavens is consistently aligned. The rise and fall of heaven and earth maintain their appropriateness, with a rise followed by a fall and a fall followed by a rise; thus, the changes in heaven and earth proceed without losing their suitability.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br>Harmonizing its movement, adjusting its transformations, ensuring that the five movements operate smoothly, and not deviating from their governance: harmonize the energies of the five movements, manifest moral cultivation, and do not stray from orders of governance. The five movements and six energies, when harmonized with moral orders and authoritative regulations, must inevitably undergo transformations of excess and resurgence. Now, if one wishes for the energies to be peaceful, one must support and restrain them by means of the five flavors, hence it is said to adjust with the proper flavors. In heaven, it is called energy; on earth, it is called flavor; flavors are used to adjust energies. Those who go along with what is beneficial should take the supportive path, while those who restrain should take the opposite path.</p>
<p>Qi Bo bowed deeply and replied: What a profound question! This is the fundamental principle of heaven and earth, the source of transformations. Who among the sages can exhaust its ultimate principles? Although I am dull, I respectfully present my understanding, so that it may endure and remain unchanged over time.</p>
<p>The five movements and yin-yang represent the way of heaven and earth, the framework of all things, the parents of transformations, the origin of life and death, and the abode of the divine. If a person can adjust their energies and movements, they will secure everlasting fulfillment without the fear of extinction, allowing for permanence without the disaster of change.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish for you to expound further, to categorize and order them, to divide their main elements, to distinguish their essential authorities, to reveal their energetic patterns, and to clarify their governance and transformation.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br>Can it be heard? Qibo said: First establish the year to clarify its nature. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the numbers of their movements; cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire, the transformations they govern. Then the way of heaven can be seen, and the spirit of the people can be adjusted. The fluctuations of yin and yang are clear, and there is no confusion nearby. What can be counted, please allow me to continue speaking about it.</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Classes&quot; refers to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. The Heavenly Stems begin with Jia, and the Earthly Branches begin with Zi, each having its own order; establishing the year first is what this refers to. The &quot;Chiefs&quot; of the divisions refer to the influence of the wind on the upper Yin, and the heat on the upper Lesser Yin. The six atmospheric influences correspond to the six divisions, each governing the year and the seasons. The &quot;lineage&quot; refers to the five movements and five phases as the rulers of the vital energies. The &quot;proper transformations&quot; refer to transformations of heat, cold, rain, and wind, which illustrate the nature being clarified. The &quot;numbers of movements&quot; indicate how the five movements succeed each other, all of which are managed, returning to their cycle in the end. The &quot;transformation they govern&quot; means that the six energies oversee those above, govern those below the spring, take charge of the seasonal energies, and additionally oversee guest energies. By clarifying the numbers of their nature, the way of heaven can be seen, the spirit of the people can be adjusted, the fluctuations of yin and yang can be clarified, and confusion dissipated.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: What about the governance of the sun? Qibo replied: It pertains to the record of Chen and Xu.</p>
<p>[Note: The years of Chen and Xu are governed by the sun, overseeing the heavens.]<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>Sun [Director of Heaven], Great Horn [Transformation and Movement], Great Yin [At the Spring]. Ren-Chen and Ren-Xu: Its movement is wind; its transformation is to vibrate, disperse, and split; its change is to shake, pull, and lift; its affliction is dizziness, loss of sight, and fainting. [Note: This section discusses the transformation and movement of Great Horn. The next section begins to discuss the Director of Heaven at the Spring and the six Qi during the intervening atmosphere. Ren signifies the yang year; the year of excessive wood thus points to Great Horn. The sounds and vibrations, as well as the proliferation, are signs of flourishing. Splitting occurs when wood sprouts and opens. The excessive wind wood thus causes shaking, pulling, and lifting. Dizziness and loss of sight are all illnesses caused by wind wood. Ni Zhongxuan states: The five movements correspond internally to the five organs, and the illness is in the liver, which is why symptoms appear in the eyes. The following five movements follow this pattern.]</p>
<p>Great Horn [Initial Correctness], Minor Adjustments, Great Palace, Minor Commerce, Great Feather [Ultimate]. [Note: The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: Between heaven and earth, within the six harmonies, one does not depart from the five. It also states: The five represent sound. Sound indicates the differentiation between winter and summer, divided by the zi and wu. Yin and yang are distinguished, while cold and heat contest. Thus, the five sounds govern the two solstices related to zi and wu, and the two divisions related to mao and you, with the central position being the soil, ruling over the four seasons. Therefore, the five sounds align with the transformations and movements of the five elements.]</p>
<p>Sun, Great Adjustments, Great Yin: Wu-Chen, Wu-Xu, both are in Correctness and Adjustments. Its movement is heat; its transformation is warm, sultry, and humid; its change is intense, fiery, and boiling; its affliction is heat and stagnation.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br>Notes: The excessive manifestation of the fire element (戊癸化火) indicates an overly powerful year of fire, hence the term &quot;Tai Zheng&quot; (太征). When the fire element is too strong, and cold water rises above it, fire is able to maintain its control, thus its brilliance is balanced, avoiding the harmful effects of excessive heat. This aligns with the year of &quot;Zheng Zheng&quot; (正征), in which the fire element is present in the noon position, leading to a harmonious gathering of energies. The heat represents the fire element&#39;s nature, characterized by warmth and oppressive heat, reflecting its transformation. Due to the excessive fire energy, its changes become fierce and turbulent. An excess of heat further translates into the affliction of heat-related illnesses. </p>
<p>Tai Zheng: Wu (戊) - Young Palace, Ji (己) - Tai Shang, Geng (庚) - Young Feather, Xin (辛) - Lesser Horn, Ding (丁) - Initial Notes: Wu symbolizes the overpowering fire element, hence named Tai Zheng. As Tai Zheng is elevated, it signifies the honoring of the energy of the year.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>The energies of the four seasons begin with the horn beam, hence from the minor corner of Ding arises the Wu fire. Fire gives rise to the Ji earth, earth gives rise to the Geng metal, and metal gives rise to the Xin water. This cycle moves from minor to major, and from major back to minor; it flows from above to below, and then rises again. I operate in a similar manner.</p>
<p>The sun corresponds with the Tai Palace, while the moon corresponds with the Tai Yin. In the year of Jia Chen, there is an assembly, and in the year of Jia Xu, there is also an assembly. Its operation is represented by dampness; its transformation is soft and moist, like heavy rain. Its change is sudden and tumultuous, while its affliction is heaviness from dampness.</p>
<p>(Note: Jia belongs to Yang Earth, thus it is associated with the Tai Palace. The operation of Earth corresponds to the four seasons, which are the years of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. The mention of cloudy rain and dimness refers to the dampness of the earth, thus it operates with dampness. It later states that its operation is gentle and moist, representing the transformation of the earth. When earth energy is excessive, it leads to sudden changes and disturbances. The heaviness from dampness corresponds to spleen disorders.)<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br><strong>Great Palace</strong><br><strong>[A] Lesser Business</strong><br><strong>[B] Great Feather</strong><br><strong>[C] Great Horn</strong><br><strong>[D] Lesser Battle</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Starting from Great Horn on the day of Ren, the initial movement governs spring. The Horn generates the energy of Gui Fire, which produces Jia Earth, Earth generate Yi Metal, and Metal generates Bing Water. Thus, the flow is from Ren to Gui, and then from Gui to Jia.]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>[Solar]</strong><br><strong>Great Business</strong><br><strong>Great Yin</strong><br><strong>Geng Chen</strong><br><strong>Geng Xu</strong>  </p>
<p>Its movement is cool, its transformation is mist and dew, its change embodies severity and death, its illness involves dryness and fullness of the chest.  </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Geng governs excessive metal movement, hence it is labeled as Great Business. Business governs the autumn metal, therefore the movement is cool. Its transformation is misty and dew, as the metal energy is too abundant, hence the change embodies severity and death. Dryness and fullness of the chest are ailments pertaining to the lungs.]</strong><a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>The Lung Shu is located in the shoulder and back, essentially being the palace of the lungs. The passage on channels states: the lungs are associated with movement-related illnesses; in severe cases, one may feel dizzy and experience issues in both hands. This happens when the lungs are excessively active, leading to self-harm.  </p>
<p>Tai Shang [Geng]<br>Shao Yu [Xin Jie]<br>Shao Jiao [Ding Chu]<br>Tai Zheng [Wu]<br>Shao Gong [Ji]<br>(Note: Ding follows the end of the previous section marked by Bing, and Xin starts the next section with Ren. The ten stems of the Five Movements are continuous and unbroken.)  </p>
<p>Tai Yang, Tai Ming, Tai Yin, Bing Chen Tian Fu, Bing Xu Tian Fu.<br>Its movement is cold, its transformation is icy and harsh, its changes bring frost, snow, and hail, and its illness leaves profound cold in the valleys.<br>(Note: Chen and Xu, governed by the Tai Yang, represent the cold water in heaven; Bing pertains to the water movement, aligning with the heavenly energy, hence it is identified as a heavenly symbol. The cold movement signifies the energy of water.)<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br>The atmosphere is chilling and severe, transforming due to water. When water overflows, it changes into ice, snow, frost, and hail, shifting from abundance to variability. The kidneys govern the bones, and the valleys are associated with the bones. The extreme cold that lingers in the valleys occurs when the qi of the environment combines with the qi of the organs, resulting in illness. 【Tai Yu】【Bing Zhong】 【Tai Jiao】【Ren Chu】 【Shao Zheng】【Gui】 【Tai Gong】【Jia】 【Shao Shang】【Yi】</p>
<p>【Note: The dominant seasonal qi, when excessive, begins with Ren for three years, following the sequence Ren, Gui, Jia, Yi, Bing; if insufficient, it begins with Ding for three years, following Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin. Observing them horizontally, the cycle recurs every six years. The seasonal qi for the time: in Yang years, it begins with Ren and finishes with Bing; in Yin years, it begins with Ding and finishes with Xin. Observing them vertically.】<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>One is great, and one is small, and they continuously succeed each other, thus governing the annual qi. This is expressed in the upper regions, hence stopping at the beginning of the horn and concluding at the end of the feather. It is understood that each year corresponds to the following: the horn wood governs spring, the fire governs summer, the metal governs autumn, and the water governs winter. If one establishes a separate diagram of the time, it is all based on the horn. Scholars comprehend this conceptually, and it is easily grasped, without the need for elaborate illustrations.</p>
<p>In all matters, the sun administers heaven&#39;s affairs and the transformation of qi operates according to the primal order. When the heavenly qi is solemn and the earthly qi is tranquil, cold arrives in the vast void. Yang qi does not compel; water and earth combine in virtue, responding to the stars of the zodiac and the fixed stars. Its grains are heavy and its governance is solemn, issuing orders gradually. The cold regime takes great action; the marsh lacks solar flame, thus fire waits for the right moment. In the lesser yang, when governance is in order, rain comes timely. Once the rain is extreme and disperses, it returns to the great yin. Clouds face the North Pole, moisture spreads, and the marsh nourishes all things. Cold settles above, and thunder moves below.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br>The cold and damp energy lingers in the atmosphere. When the people suffer from cold dampness, their muscles wither, their legs weaken and cannot retract, and they experience moist diarrhea and excessive bleeding. </p>
<p>(Note: This section discusses the overarching principles of the six energies related to seasonal and temporal changes. The yearly energy relates to the heavenly authority at the springs, while the seasonal energy pertains to the interplay of guest and host energies. Although the six energies each have their divisions, the heavenly energy is regarded as the main energy of the year; hence this is referred to as the administration of the sun in controlling heavenly matters and energies moving in accordance with nature. The years governed by the celestial branches of the rat, horse, tiger, and earth are associated with excessive energy, while those of the ox, goat, rabbit, rooster, snake, and pig are linked to insufficient energy. Energies that dominate in years characterized as excessive arrive earlier in the natural order, while those in insufficient years arrive later. Thus, it is said that &quot;excessive movement&quot; arrives early, while &quot;insufficient movement&quot; arrives late. The sun&#39;s cold water governs the heavens, thus the atmosphere is restrained; the moon&#39;s damp earth is at the springs, thus the land&#39;s energy is tranquil. Cold in the vast void prevents the yang energy from manifesting its governance; the combination of water and earth reflects the alignment with the stars of the hours and the stabilizing stars. The grains governed by the original mellow energy ripen, responding to the energy at the heavenly springs, which is referred to as the seasonal grains. Restraint is the governance of the heavens, while gradual emergence is the command of the earth. The marsh without the sun’s flame indicates the emergence of yang within the yin, subdued by cold water; these two energies signify the lesser yin and its ruling energy. Due to the strong governance of cold, it must wait for the appropriate time before emerging. The concept of &quot;waiting for the times&quot; indicates the arrival through the five energies, as the lesser yin&#39;s intermediate energy commands before it emerges. This describes the governing energies of the four seasons, which are ultimately superseded by those of the heavens.)<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>In the treatment of the Shao Yang, the Shao Yang&#39;s fire governs the energy of the three phases, while also being influenced by the cold water. Thus, timely rain becomes the edge. This refers to the governing energies of the four seasons, which are overcome by the guest energies that join them. Before the midpoint of the year, it is the celestial energies that govern; after the midpoint, it is the energies of the earth that govern. The three energies that join are dominated by cold water. The primary energy of the four seasons is associated with Tai Yin, which is why the energy of cold water ceases at the three energies, converging at the Tai Yin of the four energies. Where Tai Yin reaches, there are clouds and rain. The clouds that move towards the North Pole represent the energy of springs, transforming above. The moist earth that nourishes all things represents the energy in the lower regions. The cold settles above, belonging to the solar cold water. The thunder’s movement below represents the fire energy of Shao Yin on the right side of Tai Yin, beginning to manifest with the five energies. The energy of cold and moisture holds at the points where energies intersect, interacting up and down.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br>The ailments of the people, such as muscle atrophy and various types of diarrhea, are all caused by the onset of cold and dampness. This section discusses the overarching principles of the Taiyang governing the heavens and the Taiyin residing in the springs, along with the dominant and guest Qi of the four seasons. By applying the diagrams of the five constants to our reasoning, the sequence of the six Qis becomes clear.</p>
<p>In the initial Qi, the Earth&#39;s Qi shifts; the air becomes greatly warm, the grasses thrive early, and the people suffer. Warm illnesses arise, resulting in fever, headaches, vomiting, and skin sores and abscesses.</p>
<p>(Note: This part addresses the Qi of the period between the seasons. The transitional Qi is like a marker, while the initial Qi begins with the Shaoyang. The shift of the Earth’s Qi refers to the concluding Qi of the previous year residing in the springs, which intersects with the initial Qi of the current year governed by the heavens. The concluding Qi of last year is the fire of the Shaoyin, while the initial Qi of this year is the fire of the Shaoyang. The interaction of these two fires causes the air to be greatly warm. The thriving of the grasses signifies robust Qi.)<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a><br>As spring begins and warmth increases, the people suffer from severe illnesses. Heat-related ailments emerge, causing fever, headaches, vomiting, and sores. </p>
<p>In the second phase, a great chill returns, leading to despair among the people. The grasses encounter cold, the fire element is consequently suppressed, and the people become afflicted by stagnant internal energy filled with heat. The cold now begins.</p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;second phase&quot; refers to when the yangming metal energy arrives, causing the return of great chill and transforming the excessive heat into coolness before mid-year; hence, it is termed a return. The despair of the people is due to the cold energy present during this transitional phase. Grasses suffering from cold indicate that the chill lies below. With cold prevailing below, the fire energy from above begins to be suppressed. It is said that the atmospheric energy from heaven all arises from below. The stagnation of internal energy implies that the yang energy is constrained within. The cold now beginning refers to the cold energy from heaven, which starts with the second phase. This heavenly energy is further overcome by the intervening energies.)</p>
<p>In the third phase, the heavenly order is established, allowing cold energy to circulate, bringing rain, which results in the people suffering from cold and retroverted heat internally. The presence of boils and abscesses occurs, leading to heart heat and confusion; those untreated may die.</p>
<p>(Note: The chilling water energy from heaven arrives during the third phase, hence the establishment of heavenly order while cold energy flows and rain falls. In summer, when heat should prevail, the arrival of cold energy leads to the people suffering from internal heat that is instead cold. The presence of boils and confusion is indicative of fire stagnation; if untreated, it may lead to self-destruction.)</p>
<p>In the fourth phase, wind and moisture clash, causing the wind to transform into rain, which nurtures growth and results in maturation. The people suffer from great heat and diminished vitality, experiencing muscle atrophy, leg weakness, and loss of bodily fluids, manifesting as red and white discharges.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br>The note describes the addition of the Qi of Wind and Wood from the Yin aspect, where the dominant Qi of the Earth is the Moist Earth of the Taiyin, leading to a struggle between Wind and Moisture. When Wind transforms into Rain, it is due to the added Qi that changes with the time. At the transition from summer to autumn, the Moist Earth is the dominant Qi, which fosters growth and transformation—summer promotes growth and autumn promotes completion, while the long summer facilitates transformation. The ailments arising from excessive heat and lack of Qi are attributed to Wind and Heat disorders. Conditions of flesh weakness and limb atrophy are due to the Qi of Moist Earth. Blood appearing below, whether red or white, signifies the interaction of Moisture and Heat.</p>
<p>As for the Fifth Qi, when the Yang recovers and transforms, grass grows, evolves, and flourishes, allowing the people to feel at ease. </p>
<p>Another note indicates that the lesser Yin, represented by the Lord Fire, is augmented by cold and coolness. When the Five Qis are treated, the Yang Qi recovers and transforms, thus the so-called &quot;swamp without Yang flame,&quot; where Fire awaits its time to ignite, and Thunder activates below.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br>The fire energy transforms again, thus the grass grows. The moisture of the soil governs the seasons less than half a year, therefore it transforms. The primary energy of the five elements is linked to the dryness of metal, so it comes to fruition. The fire that is trapped releases it, enabling the people to relax.</p>
<p>The energy at the end is correct for the earth, and moisture allows for movement; the yin condenses in the vast emptiness, dust darkens the countryside, and the people are in sorrow and despair as the cold wind arrives. When the reversing force gives birth, it leads to death.</p>
<p>The energy of the spring, pertaining to the terminal energy, makes the earth&#39;s energy correct and moisture allows for action. The yin condensing in the vast emptiness refers to the movement of the great yin energy above. The dust darkening the countryside is the transformation of the moist soil spread below. The sorrowful condition of the people is due to the moisture and yin energy acting within them. The earth is responsible for nurturing earthworms, while humanity is linked to the abundance of these earthworms. Thus, when the cold wind arrives, it signifies that the earth has been overcome by the wind and wood, resulting in unsuccessful conception.</p>
<p>Therefore, the seasons should appropriately suffer, in order to dry and warm.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a><br>[Note: Bitter flavors are associated with fire, which can warm the cold, while bitterness can counteract dampness. In years when the sun governs the heavens, dampness prevails, hence it is appropriate to dry out to overcome dampness and warm up to conquer cold, achieving balance in flavors, so that harmony exists between above and below. The same principle applies to food consumption.]</p>
<p>It is essential to dispel stagnant energy and first support its source of transformation.<br>[Note: The source of transformation refers to the five movements that generate the six energies. To dispel stagnant energy means to alleviate the energies causing stagnation. For example, in the year governed by Tai Zheng, when the sun rules the heavens, the fire movement becomes stagnant; in the year of Tai Yu, when the yin is at its peak, the water movement becomes stagnant. Therefore, it is necessary to dry out to counteract the earth energy of Tai Yin and warm up to mitigate the cold evil of Tai Yang. The six energies are equivalent.]</p>
<p>Regulate the movements and energies, support those that cannot withstand, and prevent excesses that could lead to illness.<br>[Note: In years when the sun governs the heavens, if the movement and energy become excessively dominant, it is necessary to suppress the excessive energies and support the weaker ones. For instance, in the year of Tai Jiao, if the wind wood is overwhelmingly strong, the earth will be controlled by it. Thus, one should suppress the strength of wind wood and support the weakness of earth. Similarly, in the year of Tai Zheng, if the fire movement is too strong, the metal energy will be controlled. Therefore, one should moderate the excess of fire and support the weakness of metal. This is what is meant by harmonizing the movement, adjusting its transformation, and preventing excesses that could lead to illness among the people.]<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br>After the lesser yang and lesser yin years are the same. By consuming the year&#39;s grains to nurture their essence, and avoiding the false evils to stabilize their true nature. </p>
<p>(The note explains that the year&#39;s grains refer to the original grains cultivated in harmony with the heavenly energies, and consuming them allows one to absorb the essence of heaven and earth. False evils refer to the negative influences that overpower the vital energies in their midst. For instance, in the year governed by the sun, the initial energy is the lesser yang fire, but if cold overcomes it, that is the cold evil overpowering its initial energy; the second energy is the dry metal of yang brightness, but if heat overcomes it, that is the heat evil overpowering its second energy; the fourth energy is the wind wood of the exhaustive yin, but if dryness overcomes it, that is the drying evil overpowering its fourth energy; the fifth energy is the lesser yin fire lord, but if cold overcomes it, that is the heat evil overpowering its fifth energy. This is referred to as the four fears, which must be carefully observed. Thus, it is said to consume the grains in between to avoid false evils; when the evils are eliminated, the true nature will stabilize.)</p>
<p>In terms of atmosphere, similarities and differences govern it. When cold and damp are similar, they transform into dryness and heat; when they are different, they transform into dampness and dryness. Therefore, the similar are in abundance while the different are in scarcity.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br>This text discusses the theory of the five types of qi (vital energy) and their relation to the celestial phenomena and natural water sources, highlighting the similarities and differences in their qualities. The quantity and nature of qi must be adjusted according to these peculiarities. </p>
<p>When dealing with similar cold and damp conditions, represented by Taiyu and Taigong, which correspond with the cold dampness of the celestial phenomena, one should use more drying and warming flavors to counteract them. This is because dryness will control dampness, and heat will transform coldness. </p>
<p>In contrast, when addressing the conditions governed by Taizheng, Taijiao, and Taishang, which possess distinct properties from cold dampness, one should use fewer drying and damp contents for correction. This is due to the necessity of using dampness to nourish the drying and warming energies while using dryness to regulate the harmful aspects of wood and wind. </p>
<p>In instances of similarity, the energy is abundant, thus it is advisable to increase it; in cases of difference, the energy is isolated, thus it should be reduced. </p>
<p>One should use cold to counteract extreme cold, cool to ease excessive coolness, warm to mitigate extreme warmth, and hot to neutralize excessive heat. Dietary practices should align with these principles. If one deviates from these norms, it will lead to illness, which is referred to as &quot;timely action.&quot; </p>
<p>Additionally, this text reiterates the considerations of the celestial phenomena concerning water sources and the influences of the six energies, each having their suitable states of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, which should not be neglected.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br>Just as the sun governs the heavens, it is necessary to use heat to warm. When the spring energy is characterized by lesser yang fire, one should avoid this heat of lesser yang before applying warmth. When lesser yin is at the spring, cold should be used to cleanse it, while the seasonal energy reflects the cold water of the greater yang. In such cases, one must avoid this cold of greater yang before using cold. Warmth and coolness share the same meaning, and herbs and food follow the same method; this is what is meant by timing and the six positions. If there is something false, it contradicts the norm, which is to say that harmful energy overcomes, and it is not necessary to avoid cold while avoiding heat. When the greater yang cold water governs the heavens, and the spring energy reflects lesser yang fire, if the weather is cold, it is necessary to use heat, and there is no need to avoid heat. When lesser yin fire is at the spring, and the seasonal energy reflects the greater yang cold water, if the weather is warm, it is necessary to use cold, and there is no need to avoid cold. This is what is meant by the weather contradicting the season, and one can rely on the timing. Those who go against this cause ailments among the people, which is the so-called seasonal affliction. The Emperor said, &quot;Good! What about the governance of the greater yang?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;It corresponds to the cycle of the rabbit and rooster.&quot;</p>

<p>Yangming, Lesser Zheng, Lesser Yin, Cold Rain Overcomes Recovery Together, Same as Zheng Shang, Year of Gui Yin, Year of Gui You, Its Influence is Hot and Cold Rain </p>
<p>[Note: The year follows Wood as the chief element, hence it starts with the initial Zheng, beginning with Ding, which gives birth to Wu Fire, fire gives birth to Ji Earth, earth gives birth to Geng Metal, and metal gives birth to Xin Water, culminating in this way.]<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>The Right Merchants are aligned with the records of Fuxi; the Upper Merchants and the Right Merchants are the same. The Gui (癸) controls the Lesser Zheng (少征) and the Yao (卯) and You (酉) control the Yangming, while the Shaoyin is found in the spring. The movements of heat, cold, and rain correspond to the qi of warmth, the qi of cold, and the qi of rain. </p>

<p>Note: The phrase &quot;cool wind, victory, and recovery coinciding&quot; indicates the earth&#39;s movements are inadequate. The wind&#39;s counteracting victory brings a pure and cool metal energy that recovers. Ji in Yao and You, and Ji and Jia transform earth; Jia indicates excessive movements of earth while Ji indicates insufficient movements. The movements of rain and cool wind refer to the Moon&#39;s arrival, resulting in clouds and rain. Rain is the qi of earth&#39;s movements, wind is victory&#39;s qi, and coolness is recovery&#39;s qi. Therefore, when the movements are inadequate, the victorious and recovering qi correspond to their transformation. </p>

Here is the translation:</p>
<hr>
<p>Yangming, Minor Metal, Minor Yin, Heat and Cold Victory Returning Together. Together, the Proper Metal. The Heavenly Symbol of Yi (Wood) in the Year of Yi (Metal) at the Time of Yiyou. The Great Heavenly Symbol is its movement of Cooling Heat and Cold. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Heat and Cold Victory Returning Together&quot; means that heat overcomes Minor Metal, and cold energy returns. &quot;Together the Proper Metal&quot; correlates with the times of change, where Upper Metal and Proper Metal are the same. Yi represents Metal movement, and the conjunction of the energies of Yin and You with Bright Yang creates the Heavenly Symbol. The presence of Metal in You constitutes the Year Meeting. The year featuring Bright Yang signifies the Heavenly Symbol. When the Year Meeting coincides with the Heavenly Symbol, it is called the Great Heavenly Symbol, also named the Triple Conjunction. The Triple Conjunction denotes the harmony of the Heaven, Energies, and Year. The movement of Cooling Heat and Cold indicates that the energy is cool, the victorious energy is hot, and the returning energy is cold.)</p>
<p>Minor Metal, Great Feather [End]  Great Angle [Beginning]  Minor Journey  Great Palace<br>(Note: From the Great Angle, Ren (Water) is born, leading to Journey; the Journey leads to the Palace, the Palace gives birth to Minor Metal, and Metal culminates in Great Feather.)</p>
<p>Yangming, Minor Feather, Minor Yin, Rain and Wind Victory Returning Together. Xin (Metal) at the time of Yi (Wood) in Minor Palace is the Same. Xin (Metal) and You, Xin (Metal) and Yi, its movement is Cold Rain and Wind. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Rain and Wind Victory Returning Together&quot; indicates that rain is the victorious energy, and wind is the returning energy.) </p>
<p>---<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>In the year of Xinmao, the Palace corresponds to the element of water, which is insufficient, allowing the earth to take advantage of it. Therefore, the tone of the Palace resonates partially with its transformation. The energy of wood is also insufficient, represented by the Yinming years of Xinmao and Xinyou, the Taiyin years of Xinchou and Xinwei, and the Jueyin years of Xinsi and Xinhai. In the year governed by the Taiyin, the sun is in the spring, and water is enhanced and flourishing. In the year governed by Jueyin, the energy of wood rises, and earth is restrained by wood. The year of Xinyou is one where metal and water nourish each other; thus, it is primarily noted in the Xinmao year.</p>
<p>All five tones have their insufficiencies, yet only the Palace tone is mentioned because it is situated centrally among the elements and is influenced by the four seasons. Therefore, it is said that the energy of the five movements is rooted in the center and operates outward. Rooted in the center denotes the earth of the Central Palace, transforming and influencing in all directions. Cold represents energy in motion, rain signifies winning energy, and wind indicates recuperative energy; hence, the movement encompasses cold, rain, and wind.</p>
<p>Regarding the &quot;Minor Feather&quot; and &quot;Minor Horn,&quot; they represent the energy of the year&#39;s ruling. The &quot;Minor&quot; during the year begins with the Horn and concludes with the Feather. The Horn represents the beginning, and the Feather denotes the end, concerning the energies of time. Minor and Major both commence with the Horn and finish with the Feather, with the latter four seasons conforming to this.</p>
<p>All of this represents the administration of the Yangming in the realm of heaven, with energy transformations occurring in the latter days. The year governed by Mao and You indicates that the annual energy is insufficient, as all celestial governance in spring references temporal energies that arrive later. The heavenly energy is urgent, and the earthly energy is clear.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>The Yangming governs the heavens, thus the Shaoyin is at the springs. The metal command is above, hence the weather is vigorous; the ruling fire is below, hence the earth&#39;s energy is bright. When Yang exclusively exerts its command, the heat of summer prevails, and things become dry and firm. </p>
<p>With Yangming above and ruling fire below, Yang’s heat is intense, causing things to dry and harden. The pure wind then governs, and the dry winds circulate. This flow of energy is characterized by more Yang and less Yin. Clouds approach the rain office, and moisture spreads. When dryness is extreme, there are marshes. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the season, the energy is that of the Jueyin wind and wood. In years of excess, the guest energy is strong and often dominates; in years of deficiency, the guest energy is weak but still responds to the ruling energy. Therefore, the pure wind governs, reflecting the transformation of the initial energy of wind and wood. Yangming, representative of dry metal, governs the heavens, while Jueyin, associated with wind and wood, symbolizes the ruling energy. Hence, dry winds circulate and flow through the interchange of energies. </p>
<p>The interaction of ruling and guest energies refers to their intertwining dynamics. The intersection of energies occurs before the midpoint of the year, and their interaction is completed thereafter. The dual energies of ruling and guest are the two ruling fires, while the principal energies of the three are Yangming and Shaoyang, thus resulting in more Yang and less Yin. The clouds approaching the rain office signify the moisture of the earth, which, when vaporized, becomes clouds, and when the weather cools, it falls as rain. The energy of the four is under the influence of the Taiyin representing moist earth, while the Taiyang embodies cold water, leading to the phrase &quot;clouds approach the rain office, and moisture spreads.&quot; The governing dry metal fulfills its role in the triple energies, interacting with the cold water and moist earth of the four energies, thereby leading to dryness becoming extreme and marshes forming. </p>
<p>Its grain is white and stony.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>The notes indicate that the &quot;yearly harvest&quot; refers to the energy of the heavens felt in springs, which leads to maturity. The concept of &quot;intermediary harvest&quot; suggests that there is an interaction of energies between the left and right sides leading to maturation. The energy of the heavens resides in springs, interacting with the four energies from the left and right. When the Yangming is at the top, the left side is represented by Taiyang, and the right side by Shaoyang; Yangming oversees Shao while Taiyang and Shaoyang govern Tai, hence the term &quot;intermediary harvest governs Tai.&quot; This refers to the energy above, while the energies below are less emphasized. The description suggests that the numbering begins from above and concludes below, thereby highlighting the energies above. Observing the cyclical nature of the five constant principles reveals the clear distinctions between the greater and lesser energies. The final phrase mentions the consumption of the white armor and feathered goods.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>This text discusses five types of insects that are influenced by the celestial atmosphere and have limited reproduction. The terms &quot;white,&quot; &quot;armor,&quot; and &quot;variety&quot; refer to insects that respond to the celestial essence, which are merely decorative in nature and have little capacity for reproduction, unlike those that thrive during abundant times. In a year influenced by metal, all types of protective insects, described as the 360 kinds of protective insects, are born from the metal influence. However, only the white and armored ones reproduce under the celestial metal influence, while others do not.</p>
<p>When metal and fire combine harmoniously, it corresponds to the bright star and the wandering star. The governance is strict and the orders severe. Hibernating insects come to light and flowing water does not freeze. The people suffer from coughs, blockages in the throat, chills and fevers, shivering, and urinary retention.</p>
<p>The harmony of metal and fire above relates to the governance of brightness and clarity (represented by metal) and urgency and severity (represented by fire). When the force of fire is present in the spring, hibernating insects do not hide, and flowing water remains unfrozen. The ailments suffered by the people, such as throat blockages and shivering, arise from the influence of dry heat.</p>
<p>When clarity precedes vigor, woolly insects die. When heat follows and becomes severe, armored insects face disaster. This means that when the celestial energy is strong before the mid-year, it affects the outcome, while heat that intensifies later causes issues, with the insects succumbing to the dominance of the celestial influence in the spring and ultimately perishing.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said: each has its strengths, each has its controls, each has its birth, each has its completion; this refers to the five movements and six qi, each having its generation and dominance. The victory of the five movements can restrain the six qi, and the victory of the six qi can also restrain the five movements. If restraining occurs, there will be no birth or nurturing, or there may be turmoil and death.</p>
<p>As for the disturbance of the excessive victory, it creates chaos and great disorder, clearing the heat qi held in the qi interchange. </p>
<p>(Note: The qi of Yangming and Shaoyin both governs disturbance; thus, its disturbance is like fire overcoming metal. Before the midway point of the year, water overcomes fire, while after the midway point, victory and recovery arise, leading to great disorder in the seasonal qi. The qi interchange refers to the heavenly qi merging with the earthly qi, affecting the interactions above and below.)</p>
<p>In the initial qi, the earthly qi migrates, the yin begins to condense, the qi begins to become solemn, water then freezes, and cold rain transforms.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>The patient suffers from internal heat and swelling, with a puffy face; they sleep well but experience nasal congestion, nosebleeds, sneezing, nausea, and yellowish, sometimes bloody urine. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;earth&#39;s qi&quot; transitioning refers to the end of the previous year&#39;s qi converging with the beginning qi of the current year; the remaining energies operate similarly. The guest qi at the beginning of the Mao and You years is associated with the damp earth of the Taiyin, hence the condensation of yin leads to transformation into rain. It is noted that the arrival of Jueyin brings forth wind, primarily associated with the initial qi. When the external yin condenses, the internal yang becomes constrained, resulting in symptoms such as heat, swelling, and red urine among the people. A puffy face and good sleep are symptoms of damp earth disease. Nasal congestion, nosebleeds, sneezing, and nausea are manifestations of the qi of wind and wood.] </p>
<p>The energy of the second phase brings forth yang, allowing the people to relax and the things to grow and flourish; however, when severe conditions arise, it can lead to sudden deaths among the populace.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br>The text discusses the interactions of various elements in relation to health and societal conditions. It explains that when the two flames representing the sovereign and minister harmonize, the yang energy can spread, resulting in the people thriving. Conversely, when the harsh conditions intensify, it can lead to violent deaths, indicating a disbalance between the roles of power.</p>
<p>In a scenario where the three energies represent the heavenly governance, coolness prevails, and there is a convergence of dryness and heat, resulting in illness among the populace characterized by cold and heat disturbances. This is attributed to the influence of metal energy from the heavens, which causes the governance to distribute while cooling occurs.</p>
<p>As conditions further transition into a fourth phase, cold rain falls, leading to ailments such as sudden collapse, shivering, hallucinations, shortness of breath, dry throats requiring thirst, heart pain, abscesses, ulcers, and feverish illnesses, along with issues like bone weakness and bloody stools. </p>
<p>The presence of the fourth phase relates to the interaction of cold water and the governing energy from the damp earth, which brings about cold rain. As the season progresses, lesser yin energy invokes further cold and dampness, exacerbating health issues. Symptoms manifest due to cold external conditions and internal heat stagnation. The text notes that various ailments such as cold-related shivering and heart pain arise when external cold interplays with internal fire, resulting in complications. It references traditional beliefs connecting these symptoms to underlying cold energy affecting health.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>The energy of spring, when it returns, causes grass to flourish and the people&#39;s spirits to be harmonious. </p>
<p>(Note: The vigorous energy of the wood element influences the qi of spring, allowing grass to thrive, which leads to this flourishing. The subtle energy of the yin, aligned with the wood energy, allows for a harmonious spirit among the people.)</p>
<p>As the energy of the end of the season emerges, the yang energy spreads, allowing for a warm return; the hibernating insects reappear, and flowing water does not freeze. Thus, the people enjoy health and peace, while illnesses are mild.</p>
<p>(Note: The energy of the subtle yin fire influences the end of the season&#39;s energy, so the yang energy of springs results in warmth during winter. This warmth prevents hibernating insects from remaining dormant and keeps water flowing. The earth&#39;s energy is comfortable, resulting in the people&#39;s health and peace. If disasters arise, they are associated with mild illnesses, termed &quot;winter warmth diseases.&quot;)<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>Thus, consuming the annual grain stabilizes one&#39;s qi, while consuming intermediate grains dispels its evils. The &quot;annual grain&quot; refers to the white dan grain, which absorbs the energies of heaven and earth. Qi refers to the original true qi. The &quot;intermediate grain&quot; absorbs intermediate energies. In the case of the initial energy, one should eat white glutinous rice; for the second energy, one should eat white dan; for the fourth energy, one should eat dan yuan; and for the fifth energy, one should eat dan cang grain. The &quot;evil&quot; refers to the adverse influence that counters the intermediate energy.</p>
<p>The seasonal requirements include salty, bitter, and pungent flavors, which help in sweating, cleansing, and dispersing. Salty flavors help to clear the heat of the ruling fire, pungent flavors moisten the dryness of yangming, and bitter flavors help to release inner congested fire. Sweating helps to resolve external cold, cleansing helps to eliminate internal evils, and dispersing helps to relieve the warming energy of winter.</p>
<p>Stabilize one&#39;s circulation and qi, and avoid allowing evils to enter.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>[Note: The lack of fortune indicates the need for tranquility, ensuring that the邪 does not prevail.] Break the stagnant energy, and support the source of transformation. [Note: Break the energy of the celestial authority in the spring to support the transformative source of the five movements.] Regulate cold and heat, light and heavy, few and many in their control, those that share heat are more heavenly transformed, and those that share clarity are more earth transformed. [Note: Cold, being clear, refers to the heat of earth&#39;s fire; heat corresponds to the dryness of celestial metal. The similar ones are many, while the different ones are few. Therefore, using light and heavy of cold and heat to control their quantity, such as the operations of 少征 and 少角, which align with少阴&#39;s heat, many employ the heavenly transformation of coolness to control it. Similarly, the operations of 少商, 少宫, and 少羽 align with阳明&#39;s clarity, hence many employ the earthly transformation of heat to control it. Heavenly transformation refers to the coolness of dry metal; earthly transformation refers to the heat of springs.] Use coolness to dispel coolness, heat to dispel heat, cold to dispel cold, and warmth to dispel warmth. Food should follow the same principles. For those with a deficiency, it should be reversed; this is the way. To reverse this is to disturb the principles of heaven and earth and disrupt the order of yin and yang. [Note: The coolness of 阳明’s energy governs heaven, thus warm heat should be used. As for the two energies, they correspond to the two fires of the ruler and minister, and they should be avoided for sixty days and then warm heat should be applied. The君火&#39;s energy of 少阴 resides in springs, thus cold coolness should be applied. For the four&#39;s master and guest, they correspond to the cold water and damp earth, and they too should be avoided for sixty days before applying cold coolness.]<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>Those who are false consider the cold and heat of the four seasons not to be the rightful energy governed by the heavens and the vital energy between, and they attempt to control it in reverse; this is the way to harmonize the heavens and the earth, yin and yang. Conversely, to disrupt the established order of heaven and earth and disturb the pathways of yin and yang is detrimental.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! What about the governance of the lesser yang? Qi Bo replied: It pertains to the timing of yin and yang. Lesser yang correlates with the very beginning of the cycle, with the fiery element of the lesser yin influencing the latter times. Its movement is like the winds blowing, its transformation creates disruption, its changes lead to pulling and collapsing, and its ailments include dizziness, tension in the limbs, and fright.</p>
<p>(Note: The water element dominates when wood is excessive; during the yin and yang cycles, the lesser yang governs the heavens, while the lesser yin is stationed by the spring, sharing energy akin to that of the sun and the fiery element, but manifesting differently. Wood and earth combine in ailments of the blood; wood and fire bring about ailments of the energy. Dizziness and fright, as the classics say, relate to the liver. The east corresponds to the liver wood, its ailments causing fright.)</p>
<p>At the very beginning, the lesser governance calls for a lesser tribute, a great womb, and lesser commerce, culminating in a great feather. The lesser yang then progresses through its final forms in lesser tribute, lesser commerce, and heavenly signs of earth, sustaining summer’s heat, with transformations causing heat and strife. Its changes are of intense inflammation and boiling, leading to ailments of extreme heat, congested blood, bleeding, diarrhea, and heart pain.</p>
<p>(Note: The earth element signifies excessive fire. In the year with the fire element, one observes the lesser yang, as the heavens align with it; thus, the &quot;Celestial Records&quot; states that the heavenly symbol erupts in intense flames, reaching its peak. Ailments from heat arise precisely because the fire element is greatly influencing the lesser yang.)<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br>Tai Zheng, Shao Gong, Tai Shang, Shao Yu.

<p>[Note: Softness is the virtue of Earth, and moistness is the transformation of humidity. Wherever the Greater Yin reaches, there is sudden thunder and fierce winds, which are the regular changes in qi. Heaviness in the body, swelling, distension, and thirst arise from the influence of Tai Gong, leading to spleen diseases. There are three types of excessive qi: three, five, one, and fifteen, which correspond to people&#39;s ailments, showing little difference. This is because the influence of the heavenly realm is slightly different in its transformation. ] </p>

<p>[Note: In the year of excessive metal, the fire that regulates the heavens adjusts it, resulting in a balanced metal qi, therefore it aligns with the Zheng Shang year. Given the peaceful metal qi, it is termed clear and crisp. The lung channels originate in the chest; the acupoints are in the shoulders and back, hence ailments manifest in the shoulders and chest.]<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a><br>The Great Commerce: Lesser Feather (End)<br>Lesser Horn (Beginning)<br>The Great Zhen: Lesser Palace<br>Lesser Yang: Great Feather<br>Absolute Yin: Bing Yin; Bing Shen<br>Its movement is cold and solemn, its transformation is condensed and eerie; its changes manifest as ice, snow, frost, and hail; its ailment is cold edema.<br>[Note: The condensation and eeriness, ice, snow, frost, and hail are all transformations of the Great Feather.

The so-called mutual interaction between above and below, the Qi interchanges to dominion, thus the cycle of the years is completed.]<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a><br>In the year of Yin and Shen, the Earth’s energies are abundant, and the six atmospheric energies arrive according to the seasonal cycles. The essence of blue, dull red, and pure white originates and evolves into the five elements of the Earth; the five elements of the Earth present themselves as the six atmospheric energies from above. Thus, it is said that cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven, with three yin and three yang presented from below. Therefore, the three yin and three yang are below, while the six energies are above. Thus, above the Lesser Yang, the fire energy governs, while the Severe Yin is seen within; above the Severe Yin, the wind energy governs, while the Lesser Yang is visible within. When the heavenly energy is correct, it is said that the Lesser Yang directs the heavens, and the energy transforms within the interactions of energies. Given that the three yin and three yang are below, even though they govern the heavens, the energies descend and circulate within. The sun’s shadow is in the spring, hence the Earth’s energy is disturbed. The subsequent text states that where the Severe Yin arrives, it brings disturbance and response, following its constant course. Wind, therefore, rises violently, trees bow, and flames flow.<br>(Note: Fire is the energy of wind.)<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br>Yin flows upward, yang transforms; rain thus comes at the right time.<br>[Note: This means the yin energy rises while following the transformation of shao yang, hence rain occurs at the appropriate time. Indeed, where shao yang reaches, fire is born. Ultimately, it leads to steam and humidity, which is the usual transformation of virtues.]<br>Fire and wood share the same virtue, responding above to the comets and the planets.<br>[Note: The two stars above respond brightly.]<br>The grain is reddish and blue.<br>[Note: This refers to the atmosphere responding to the heavenly control, resulting in the maturing of crops.]<br>The government is strict, and the edicts are intrusive.<br>[Note: Strictness refers to the governance of fire; intrusiveness refers to the edicts of wind.]<br>Thus, wind and heat interweave, clouds billow and boil, the tai yin flows fiercely, and cold arrives on time, with cool rain occurring simultaneously.<br>[Note: The interplay of wind and heat refers to the intermingling of shao yang and jue yin, which combines and spreads through the atmosphere. The boiling clouds indicate that the earthly energy rises. The fierce flow of tai yin and simultaneous cool rain signifies that steam and humidity manifest as rain. According to the transformation of jue yin wind and wood, it ascends from celestial changes, so tai yin moist earth follows it; thus, the wind comes down, representing the meaning of yellowing soil. It fears being overwhelmed yet follows it.]<br>The people suffer from internal cold, externally manifesting sores and ulcers, while internally they have diarrhea and fullness. Therefore, the sage encounters this with harmony and without contention. As cycles unfold, the people&#39;s ailments include chills, fevers, intermittent fevers, diarrhea, deafness, dizziness, vomiting, swelling, and changes in complexion.<br>[Note: When the winds and heat are external, the cold and humid energies are internal, causing external sores and internal cold leading to fullness.]<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br>When the sage encounters this period, they harmonize the cold and heat, preventing external and internal conflicts from arising. If external and internal forces clash, it leads to maladies of cold and heat, such as diarrhea, deafness, dizziness, and vomiting, where the energy of wind and heat prevails within. Swellings and color changes signify that cold and dampness dominate from without.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, the energy of the earth moves, the wind prevails and shakes, the cold departs, and the season turns warm. Vegetation flourishes early; the cold does not kill, and thus warmth-related illnesses arise. Symptoms of illness include upward blockage, blood overflowing leading to red eyes, coughing with reverse flow, headaches, blood loss, fullness in the sides, and skin sores.</p>
<p>In this initial period, the energy aligns with the Lesser Yin&#39;s fire, while the governing energy corresponds with the Severe Yin&#39;s wind and wood; hence the wind stirs and the temperature rises, allowing plants to absorb the life-giving energy early. The Lesser Yang governs the heavens, paired with the fire of the ruler, which means that despite the arrival of seasonal cold, it does not kill, due to the warmth of both fires. Symptoms like blood overflow, red eyes, coughing, and skin sores showcase the afflictions caused by wind and fire.</p>
<p>In the second phase, fire reacts with pent-up energy, white dust rises everywhere, clouds gather, and rain is anticipated. If the wind cannot overcome the moisture, the rain falls, and the people find relief.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a><br>The illness manifests as heat accumulating in the upper body, with symptoms of cough, nausea, and sores arising in the middle; there is discomfort in the chest and sides, headaches, fever, confusion, and pus-filled sores. </p>
<p>[Note: The guest qi of the second phase is the damp earth of the Taiyin, thus the fire energy in charge of heaven becomes repressed. White dust rises, clouds move towards the rain chamber, all are transformations of the damp earth qi. The wind qi of the Jueyin, while ascending with the Shaoyang, cannot overcome the rainy dampness. When wind and fire energies are strong and harmonized by Yin dampness, the people are well. If there are calamities, then symptoms of repressed heat, vomiting, confusion, and pus-filled sores arise, caused by the external Yin dampness and internal repressed fire heat.]</p>
<p>In the third phase, the heavenly influence is distributed, the scorching heat arrives, the Shaoyang approaches the upper, and rain is about to come. The people suffer from internal heat illnesses, with symptoms of deafness and blindness, bleeding, swollen sores, cough, vomiting, nasal hemorrhage, thirst, sneezing, throat obstruction, red eyes, and sudden death.</p>
<p>[Note: The heavenly qi approaches in the third phase, thus the heavenly influence is distributed. The seasonal qi also belongs to Shaoyang, hence the arrival of scorching heat. When it is about to rain, the Taiyin flows horizontally. The people’s internal heat illnesses, symptoms of bleeding, and sneezing are caused by the influence of wind and fire qi.]<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a><br>When two fires intersect and wind warmth arrives together, it leads to sudden deaths. The fourth phase brings coolness, as the heat of summer transforms, and white dew descends, resulting in contentment among the people. This condition manifests as a heavy illness throughout the body. </p>
<p>(Note: The addition of timely cold air corresponds to the clear and cool energy of Yangming, hence the arrival of coolness and the descent of white dew. The heat of lesser Yang fire mingles with the warm wind, prompting this seasonal transformation. Since warm winds dominate the year, encountering this coolness brings peace among the people. The heavy illness throughout the body is attributed to the damp earth energy of the season.)</p>
<p>In the fifth phase, the Yang energy departs, cold arrives, rain falls, the gates of energy close, and the tough wood withers early. People avoid cold evils, and the wise individual takes precautions. </p>
<p>(Note: The energy of the fifth phase consists of the cold water of the sun, hence Yang heat departs as cold is near. With the transition between autumn and winter, this leads to the closing and storing characteristic of winter, hence the gates of energy are closed and precautions must be taken to ward off cold evils.)</p>
<p>In the final phase, the earth&#39;s energy is upright, the wind arrives, all things regenerate, and frost and fog occur. The illnesses manifest as closed pathways with restriction, causing heart pain, and Yang energy failing to retain results in coughing. </p>
<p>(Note: The “end” energy is governed by the wind of Jueyin wood, hence the wind arrives.)<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a><br>The essence of the Earth, when it is upright, reveals the transformation of Shaoyang from within. All things encounter the vital energy and begin to thrive; the Earth’s energy then rises up. During times of frost and mist, it acts and conceals, thus commanding the process of emergence. Therefore, those who suffer from blockages and heart pain have kidney energy ascending to the heart. The lungs govern Qi, while the kidneys are the source of vitality; thus, the kidneys are foundational, and the lungs are secondary. Yang energy, in winter, returns to the kidneys, but if it instead ascends to the lungs, it leads to cough.</p>
<p>In cases of excessive energy, one must suppress it. It is essential to break the stagnation and first address the source of transformation. Intense excess does not bring forth life, and harsh illnesses do not arise.</p>
<p>When the energy is too much, it must be suppressed. What cannot withstand it, like during the Ren year when the wood energy is excessive, leads to the Earth energy being overwhelmed; in the Wu year, when the fire energy is excessive, the metal energy becomes overwhelmed. Therefore, it is appropriate to suppress the overabundance and support what cannot be overwhelmed. Breaking the stagnant energy occurs, for example, in the Geng Yin and Geng Shen years, when Shaoyang governs the heavens, thus the commerce energy suffers stagnation; in the Jia Yin and Jia Shen years, where Jueyin resides in the spring, the palace energy suffers stagnation.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br>To address the excess of stagnant energy, one should first draw from the source of the Five Movements, moderating its extremes and supporting its insufficiency. Hence, excessive conditions do not arise, and harsh ailments do not emerge. The term &quot;excessive&quot; refers to the energy of the Tai Gong and Tai Shang, which governs excess and in turn experiences stagnation, resulting in its severity. Extreme excess is called &quot;harsh&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a year, one should favor salty,辛, and sour elements to mitigate the detrimental effects of the environment. </p>
<p>Salty is appropriate to control the fire of the lesser yang, and辛 helps to overcome the evil of the wind and wood. The Jue Yin follows the transformation of the lesser yang fire, thus it drains the mother’s energy, making the use of sour necessary for replenishment. The term &quot;soak&quot; refers to the ancient practice of using liquids to extract sweat. &quot;Seep&quot; refers to draining in order to clear the internal heat; &quot;soak&quot; is for dispersing external wind evils.</p>
<p>Observe the cold and warm air to adjust the excess. Similar winds with heat tend to undergo more cold transformation, while dissimilar wind heats experience less cold transformation. </p>
<p>The cold and warm refer to the temperatures of the Five Movements. In years of Tai Jiao or Tai Zheng, when the atmospheric conditions resonate with the wind and heat at the springs, one often uses cooler elements for cleansing. In the years of Tai Gong, Tai Shang, and Tai Yu, when the energies differ from those at the springs, less cooling is needed.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a><br>Food and medicine follow the same principles. Use hot to counteract heat, use warm to counteract warmth, use cold to counteract cold, use cool to counteract cool. Food should adhere to the same principles. This is the way of it. Those who deviate from this are in a state of illness.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Excellent! What about the governance of the Taiyin? Qibo replied: It corresponds to the intervals of Chou and Wei. Taiyin, Shaojiao, and Taiyang: Clear heat overcomes recovery, all are in harmony with the right palace. Ding Chou and Ding Wei; their movement is of wind and clear heat.</p>
<p>Notice: Shaojiao governs the wood element, thus clear energy overcomes it. Where there is overcoming, there is recovery, hence heat induces recovery. The clear heat overcoming recovery energy is in harmony with the wood element&#39;s transformation. Those in harmony with the right palace are the records of regulation; the upper palace and the right palace are in unity. The movement of wind and clear heat signifies that wind is the moving energy, clear is the overcoming energy, and heat is the recovering energy; all three energies are in harmony in their movement. </p>
<p>It is noted that one speaks of illness in terms of excessive movement, but does not speak of illness regarding insufficient movement, for excessive movement is abrupt, while insufficient movement is gradual.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br>Lesser Horn, Initial Zheng, Greater Zheng, Lesser Palace, Greater Commerce, Lesser Feather, End, Greater Yin, Lesser Zheng, Sun, Cold Rain Dominates, Together, Gui Chou, Gui Wei, its movement is Heat, Cold, Rain. </p>

<p>   Shao Shang, Tai Yu [End]<br>   Tai Jiao [Start]<br>   Shao Zheng, Tai Gong, Tai Yin, Shao Yu, Tai Yang<br>   Rain and wind triumph over each other, both are in the same palace, Xin Chou, Xin Wei, their movement is cold rain and wind.<br>   [Note: The same palace refers to the situation of diminished flow, where the upper palace and the central palace are the same.]<br>   Shao Yu [End]<br>   Shao Jiao [Start]<br>   Tai Zheng, Shao Gong, Tai Shang<br>   Overall, the Tai Yin governs the affairs of Heaven, and the transformation of qi operates in the later heaven. The Yin exclusively governs the affairs, the Yang qi retreats and hides, the great wind occasionally rises, the weather descends, the earth qi ascends, the fields are dim and hazy, the white dust rises everywhere, the clouds race toward the southern pole, cold rain arrives frequently, and things mature in varying summer conditions. The people suffer from cold and dampness, bloating, bodily irritations, swelling, stagnation, and cold-induced urgency.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br>Moist cold combines with virtue, yellow and black dust darkens, the circulating qi interacts, responding upwards to the Zheng and Chen stars. The governance is solemn, the decrees quiet, suitable for the valley grain.</p>
<p>(Note: The moon governs the heavens; cold water is at the spring, hence the yin predominates in governance. The yang retreats, and the soil&#39;s command does not reach, while the wind overcomes it. The cold and wet qi of heaven and earth interact, thus the fields are shrouded in mist; cold rains arrive frequently. This differs from summer; it is the time of late summer, the beginning of autumn. The people suffer from abdominal fullness and other symptoms, all caused by the cold and wet qi. The combination of cold and wet yields yellow and black dust in darkness, and the circulating qi interacts, responding upwards to the bright Zheng and Chen stars. &quot;Solemn&quot; pertains to the governance of the earth. &quot;Quiet&quot; refers to the decrees of water. The valley grain arises from the influence of the qi governed by the heavens in the spring.)</p>
<p>Thus, the yin condenses above, while cold accumulates below. When cold water overcomes fire, it becomes hail. If the sunlight does not regulate, the killing qi will manifest. </p>
<p>(Note: The moist qi of the moon condenses above, while the cold qi of the sun accumulates below; when cold water overcomes fire, it results in hail.)<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br>The fire’s emergence is akin to the flourishing of vegetation; mountains and rivers covered in ice and snow represent this. When the yang energy is positioned above and is overcome by the yin, the chilling and killing energy arises. This illustrates the interplay of the upper and lower forces of yin and yang. </p>
<p>Thus, when there is an abundance, it is appropriate to rise; when there is deficiency, it is suitable to descend. The benefit of the earth lies in the transformation of its energy, which the populace adapts to, thereby influencing their fate. </p>
<p>This refers to the varying elevations and thickness of the soils in the five regions. Therefore, when seasonal energy is abundant, the soil should be high and thick; when the seasonal energy is lacking, the soil should be low and thin. An excess of energy should be moderated, while a deficiency should be prioritized. High and thick soil allows energy to be more gradual in emergence; lower soil permits easier ascension of energy. When energy is abundant, it should arrive more slowly; when deficient, it should arrive more quickly. This reflects the geographical advantages of high and low lands, the timing of energy arrivals, and the corresponding behavior of the populace, which is governed by this dynamic.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a><br>In the beginning of the season, the earth&#39;s qi shifts, the chill departs, the spring qi is established, the wind arrives, nurturing all things to thrive, and the people feel at ease. The interaction of wind and dampness leads to rain arriving later. The people suffer from symptoms of blood overflow, stiff muscles, tense tendons, obstructed joints, heaviness in the body, and muscle atrophy. </p>
<p>(Note: The initial influence of the qi for both rulers and subjects is controlled by wind qi; hence, the earth&#39;s qi shifts before the year starts, and the winter chill departs. When the spring qi is proper, the winds come, fostering the growth of all things, and the people&#39;s spirits are at ease. The interplay of the ruling and subject qi with the atmospheric qi delays the arrival of rain. The illnesses such as blood overflow and muscle atrophy are all due to the influence of wind and damp qi.)</p>
<p>In the second season, the great fire is proper, and things transform; thus, the people are harmonious. The illnesses arise from severe warmth and spread across the land. With dampness steaming and mingling, rain falls at the appropriate times.</p>
<p>(Note: The influences of the rulers and subjects here are represented by the two fires; hence, the great fire is strong. The combination of fire and earth brings forth transformation, leading to harmony among the people.)<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br>The prevalence of damp heat leads to the harshness of warmth. The earth&#39;s energy is abundant in all directions, thus both near and far experience it uniformly. In the third atmospheric phase, heavenly governance distributes, dampness descends, earth&#39;s energy rises, and rain falls timely, followed by cold. When affected by cold dampness, the people suffer from heavy bodies, swelling, and fullness in the chest and abdomen. </p>
<p>Note: The air from the heavens influences the three energies; the cold dampness is active in the interplay of energies. </p>
<p>In the fourth phase, there is a fear of fire&#39;s arrival, steam transforms, the earth&#39;s energy rises, and the heavenly energy is separated. The cold wind morning and evening, steam and heat suppress one another; plants and trees are shrouded in mist, dampness condenses without flowing, resulting in white dew and signaling the arrival of autumn. People suffer from heat in the pores, overflowing blood, fevers, and fullness and heat in the heart and abdomen, leading to severe swelling. </p>
<p>Note: The guest energy of the fourth phase aligns with the lesser yang fire. Cold water in springs thus fears the encroachment of fire.<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br>The energy of the fourth phase is governed by the Great Yin, which represents moist and loamy earth. When dampness and heat combine, it creates a steamy vapor that rises from the earth. The damp and cold energy does not integrate well with fire energy, causing a blockage in the weather&#39;s flow. As a result, dampness does not descend; instead, the white dew appears, signaling the arrival of autumn. The cold wind represents the frigid energy of the sun and water. The people suffer from fullness and other related ailments, which arise from the mingling of cold, damp, and heat energies, manifesting as illness.</p>
<p>The energy of the fifth phase is now surging. The cold dew has descended, and frost falls early. The vegetation turns yellow and withers, while the cold energy affects the body. A gentleman must be meticulous; the people suffer from skin conditions.</p>
<p>(Note: The energies of the fifth phase, whether master or servant, are all the clear and cooling energies of Yangming. Thus, the signs of cold and the command to store up energy arise early, prompting the gentleman to exercise caution. The Yangming energy governs the muscles, which explains the sickness affecting the skin.)</p>
<p>In the final phase, the cold becomes prominent, dampness intensifies, frost accumulates, and Yin becomes solidified. Water hardens into ice, and sunlight fails to correct this.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a><br>When affected by the cold, a person experiences joint stiffness and lumbar pain; the cold and dampness invade the interaction of the qi, leading to illness. The root cause is the coldness of the water, which is why the cold is severe. The interaction between the cold and damp qi, both above and below, causes great transformation of dampness. Frost accumulates and solidifies, transforming the dampness; ice grows rigid and suppresses the yang, enforcing the cold. The kidneys store during winter and govern the bones; hence, the joints become stiff and the movements of the bones are restricted. The lumbar region pertains to the kidneys. The cold and damp hold the qi in intersection, which refers to the balance of the qi between heaven and earth; people become ill within this interaction of qi.</p>
<p>One must break through the accumulated qi to find the source of transformation, enhancing the seasonal qi to prevent the evil from prevailing. The seasonal energies are insufficient, hence the need for enhancement. The evil qi refers to the qi that one cannot overcome.</p>
<p>Consume grains of the season to maintain one&#39;s essence, and eat intermediate grains to preserve one&#39;s vital energy. The essence refers to the true origin born from the Unity of Heaven, which encompasses both essence and qi.<a id="trans-242p" href="#orig-242p" class="marker">[242p]</a><br>Therefore, it is said that the true essence is refined. Thus, the seasons should be adjusted with bitter and dry warmth; in extreme cases, these should be released. If not released, dampness overflows, leading to flesh decay and skin splitting, causing the mingling of water and blood. One must support the yang fire to resist severe cold. From the harmonies of qi, distinctions in quantity are made. Those with similar cold are transformed by heat; those with similar dampness are transformed by dryness. The differing should be reduced, while the similar should be increased. Use coolness to counter coolness, cold to counter cold, warmth to counter warmth, and heat to counter heat. Eating should follow the same principles. Conversely, if one applies oppositely, that leads to sickness. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Excellent! How is the governance of the Lesser Yin? Qi Bo replied: It pertains to the intercalary cycle of the yin and yang. </p>
<p>Lesser Yin, Great Horn, Yangming, Renzi, Renwu; its movements are like wind drums, its transformations are chaotic and disruptive; its changes are shaking, pulling, crushing, and lifting; its diseases are fullness and obstruction.<a id="trans-243p" href="#orig-243p" class="marker">[243p]</a><br><strong>Great Horn</strong> 【Initial Correctness】 <strong>Minor Summoning</strong> <strong>Great Palace</strong> <strong>Minor Commerce</strong> <strong>Great Feather</strong> 【Final】 <strong>Minor Horn</strong> 【Final** <strong>Minor Yin</strong> <strong>Great Summoning</strong> <strong>Bright Yang</strong> <strong>Wuzi Heavenly Sign</strong> <strong>Wuwu Great Yi Heavenly Sign</strong> Its operation brings scorching heat; its transformations are warm and radiant; its changes are intensely hot and boiling; its illness manifests as upper heat and overflowing blood. 【Note: In years of fire operation, Minor Yin is seen above, hence it is called Heavenly Sign.

Its movement is cool and vigorous, its transformation is mist and dew, its change is solemn and chilling, and its affliction is to lower clarity.<br>[Note: Coinciding with the correct Commerce refers to the time of firm establishment aligning with Lesser Exertion and correct Commerce, its energy akin to Great Commerce. The affliction of lowering clarity is due to the influence of autumn&#39;s metal energy.]  </p>
<p>Great Commerce, Lesser Feather [End]<br>Lesser Angle [Beginning]<br>Great Exertion, Lesser Palace<br>Lesser Yin, Great Feather, Yang Ming, during the year of Bing Zi, coincides with Bing Wu. Its movement is cold, its transformation is freezing and gloomy, its change is ice, snow, frost, and hail, and its affliction is coldness affecting clarity.<br>[Note: During the year of Bing Zi, the water energy is dominant. Its affliction of coldness affecting clarity arises from the influence of cold water energy.]  </p>
<p>Great Feather [End]<br>Great Angle [Beginning]<br>Lesser Exertion, Great Palace, Lesser Commerce<br>All these belong to the Lesser Yin&#39;s governance of heaven, where the energies and transformations operate according to the primordial.<a id="trans-245p" href="#orig-245p" class="marker">[245p]</a><br>The earth&#39;s energy is solemn, the sky&#39;s energy is clear; cold meets heat, and warmth adds dryness. Clouds race towards the rain treasury, moisture transforms and then acts, timely rains descend. Metal and fire unite in virtue, corresponding with the comet and Venus. Governance is clear, decrees are strict, and the grains are red and white. Water and fire, cold and heat, interact in the atmosphere, and thus diseases begin. </p>
<p>In years of excess, atmospheric movements arrive according to natural timing. Dry metal is in the springs, hence the earth&#39;s energy is solemn. The ruler fire is in the heavens, hence the sky&#39;s energy is clear. The end energy before the year is the slight yang fire; the initial energy of the current year is the great yang cold water. Thus, cold meets heat, and water and fire interacting brings forth disease.</p>
<p>The ruler fire above, dry metal below; hence it is said warmth adds dryness. Clouds race to the rain treasury, moisture transforms and then acts, timely rains descend, indicating the slight yang approaching. The conjunction of metal and fire, responding to the comet and bright Venus, indicates clear governance and strict decrees. The grains that are red and white mature under the influence of metal and fire energy. </p>
<p>Heat diseases arise from above, while clear diseases arise from below; cold and heat clash and contend in the middle.<a id="trans-246p" href="#orig-246p" class="marker">[246p]</a><br>The people suffer from coughs and wheezing, blood disorders, hemorrhages, sneezing, red eyes, eye sores, chills entering the stomach, heart pain, waist pain, and swollen dry throats. </p>
<p>(Note: When cold and heat clash, their forces conflict in the body, causing illness. Coughing, wheezing, blood issues, sneezing, red eyes, eye sores, and swollen dry throats arise from heat diseases, while blood diarrhea and chills come from lower illnesses. Heart pain, waist pain, and abdominal swelling occur from the struggle between cold and heat in the body.)</p>
<p>As the initial qi arrives, the earth’s energy shifts; dryness begins to dissipate, and cold starts to set in. Insects that hibernate now hide away, and water turns to ice. Frost descends again, and the wind arrives. Yang qi stagnates, causing people to feel confined, with stiff joints and waist pain; the heat of summer approaches, leading to internal and external sores.</p>
<p>(Note: The initial guest qi is influenced by the cold water of the Sun, thus the dryness and heat of the previous years will diminish, and cold will begin. Hibernating insects hide away, and frost forms again. The initial energy associated with this is the wind and wood of the Jueyin phase, hence the arrival of the wind. As the spring energy stagnates, people feel confined; the sun governs the tendons associated with the kidney organs, leading to stiff joints and waist pain. The time also coincides with the fire of the two energies, leading to the imminent heat of summer.)<a id="trans-247p" href="#orig-247p" class="marker">[247p]</a><br>The second energy, when the yang energy is spread out, the wind begins to blow, and the spring energy is in harmony, all things respond and flourish. When the cold energy arrives, the people are at peace. The ailments manifest as dysuria, with closed and reddened eyes, indicating stagnant energy above that is hot.</p>
<p>Note: The second energy refers to the main energy, associated with the heavenly sovereign, the fire. The guest energy corresponds to the yin wind wood, thus the yang energy spreads and the wind acts. When spring energy begins to stabilize, all things respond to the growing energy and flourish. It is understood that the upper aspect of the lesser yin is ruled by the sovereign fire, while the lesser yin indicates the yin and originates from heat. Both this energy and the third energy are governed by the sovereign fire, and when it is said that the cold energy has arrived, it means the lesser yin follows the original and indicates. The interaction of cold and heat energy is what brings harmony to the people. The ailments of dysuria and closed eyes pertain to the sickness caused by cold energy. The classics state: when yang is strong, the eyes glare; when yin is strong, the eyes close. Red eyes signify the energy of the sovereign fire. Stagnant energy above that is hot signifies the upper involvement of cold energy.</p>
<p>The third energy, when the heavenly governance is dispersed, the great fire moves, and all creatures thrive abundantly as the cold energy arrives. The people suffer from energy obstruction, experiencing heart pain, alternating cold and heat, cough, shortness of breath, and reddened eyes.</p>
<p>Note: The third energy refers to the main energy, which is the sovereign and mutual fire, thus as the heavenly governance is dispersed and the great fire moves, multitudes receive vital energy and flourish profoundly.<a id="trans-248p" href="#orig-248p" class="marker">[248p]</a><br>As the cold air arrives, the people suffer from heart pain. This is because the ruling fire is above while the coldness is below; when the cold energy oppresses the heart, it results in heart pain, and this causes further fluctuations between cold and heat. When it affects the lungs, it leads to coughing and wheezing, as the lungs are the cover of the heart and connect down to the kidneys. If the ruling fire is forced to rise and inflame, the eyes will turn red.</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth stage, as the hot and humid weather arrives, heavy rains occur, and cold and heat alternate. The people suffer from cold and heat, experiencing dryness of the throat, yellowing of the phlegm, and nasal bleeding. </p>
<p>In the fifth stage, fear of fire arises; the heat returns and the yang transforms. All things grow and flourish, and the people are healthy, although they may be ill from warmth.</p>
<p>For those under half a year old, the primary energy corresponds to the Yangming, with the Shaoyang’s fire accentuating it, hence the fear of ascending and prolonged air. Intermittent energy is in command, causing the heat to return and the yang to transform, allowing all beings to gain vital energy and thrive. The combination of cool and warm energies leads to the health of the people.<a id="trans-249p" href="#orig-249p" class="marker">[249p]</a><br>When there are disasters and calamities, one feels warmth and heat, resulting in warm diseases. The end of vital qi causes dryness to circulate; residual fire internally conflicts, leading to swelling above, coughing, and wheezing, which, if severe, can result in bleeding. When cold qi increases frequently, it brings about fog and haze, causing illness to manifest on the skin and accumulate below the ribs, extending to the lower abdomen and inducing coldness. The earth is about to change. </p>
<p>(Note: The end of vital qi refers to the Yangming dryness and metal directive, hence causing dryness to circulate. The combination of residual heat leads to symptoms like coughing and bleeding. Cold is governed by seasonal influences, hence an increase in cold qi affects the skin and causes illness. The earth branches begin with Zi and oppose Wu. When the six qi have concluded, the energy of springs is about to change and merge with Chou and Wei.)</p>
<p>One must suppress the operation of qi, support it through favorable years, reduce pent-up energy, and first seek the source of transformation, preventing it from becoming excessive and leading to illness.</p>
<p>(Note: The operation of qi is too strong, hence it should be suppressed and supported to not exceed what the year can bear. Pent-up energy refers to the qi of the five operations, becoming extreme leads to its outbreak.)</p>
<p>Eat harvested grains to maintain true qi; consume processed grains to ward off non-orthodox evils.</p>
<p>(Note: Non-orthodox evils refer to improper and aberrant energies. By safeguarding one&#39;s essence, these evils will naturally be repelled.)<a id="trans-250p" href="#orig-250p" class="marker">[250p]</a><br>The year should mainly soften it and adjust what is above; if it is excessive, use bitterness to release it, and sourness to collect it, thus stabilizing what is below; if it is still excessive, use bitterness to drain its dryness. </p>
<p>(Note: The salty element, deriving from water, can soften hardness and harmonize the fire of the lord above. If the fire is too repressed, use bitterness to release its stagnation. The metal element governs collection, so sourness is appropriate to settle that which is below; if it is too dry, then bitterness should drain it.)</p>
<p>The appropriate energies are same and different in quantity. For the same celestial energies, use cold to clarify; for the same terrestrial energies, use warm to transform. Utilize heat to extend heat, coolness to extend coolness, warmth to extend warmth, and cold to extend cold. Eating should follow the same principles. If there is an exception, it will lead to illness. </p>
<p>(Note: The heat from the celestial authority should be clarified with cold. For the refreshing coolness of springs, warm heat should be used.)</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! How should the governance of Jueyin be managed? Qibo replied: It pertains to the years of Zi and Hai. </p>
<p>Jueyin, Shaojiao, Shaoyang, Qingre Shengfu all operate similarly; when in the same hexagrams, the phenomena of the upper horn align with the correct horn.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a><br>The celestial symbols signify the years governed by wood, where the yin aspect is manifest. </p>

<p>Small omen, great palace; small commerce, great feather, final; great horn, initial. The yin aspect, small palace, small yang, clear wind surpasses and returns to sameness, the same as the rectifying horn. Year of ji si, year of ji hai, where the movement encompasses rain and clear wind.</p>
<p>Note: The same as the rectifying horn refers to the humble keeper&#39;s record, where the upper horn and rectifying horn align. </p>
<p>Small palace, great commerce, small feather, final; small horn, initial; great omen. The yin aspect, small commerce, small yang, heat and cold surpass and return to sameness, the same as the rectifying horn. Year of yi si, year of yi hai, where the movement encompasses coolness, heat, and cold.</p>
<p>Note: The same as the rectifying horn refers to the reformative record, where the upper horn and rectifying horn align.</p>
<p>Small commerce (yi), great feather (bing, final); great horn (ren, initial); small omen (gui); great palace (jia).</p>
<p>This completes the understanding of previous notes.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a><br>The Qi of Jueyin, Shaoyu, and Shaoyang, along with the rain and wind, prevail together. In the years of Xin Sì and Xin Hài, the operation is characterized by cold rain and wind. </p>
<p>(Note: The Qi of rain and wind, which prevails, is not the same as the genuine transformations of the year, known as the transformations of evil, and therefore does not correlate with the proper operations of the year.) </p>
<p>Shaoyu begins in the year of Ding and ends in Xin. </p>
<p>All of this pertains to the governance of heaven by Jueyin, where the Qi transforms and operates through the later heaven. </p>
<p>(Note: The operations of the Qi in years when it does not prevail are those that arrive from the later heaven). </p>
<p>In all shared years, the Qi transforms and operates in the same manner as heaven.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a><br>The text discusses the harmonization of the elements of Yin and Yang, specifically focusing on the interaction between the lesser Yang (少阳) and the extreme Yin (厥阴). It states that when the lesser Yang governs the skies, the atmospheric conditions are correct, and when it is in the springs, the earth’s energy is also proper. It suggests that the energy of extreme Yin is aligned with the operation of lesser Yang, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Consequently, the winds rise high and far, bringing along warmth. Clouds gather to deliver rain, and moisture moves along with it. Wind and fire operate in harmony, responding to the guiding stars above. Political actions may be disrupted, edicts may be issued rapidly, and the grain is a mix of colors indicating its state. There are losses in culture and refinement. Winds bring dryness and heat, which further exacerbate conditions. Hibernating insects emerge, and flowing water does not freeze. Heat-related illnesses arise below, while wind-related ailments occur above, with the dry winds influencing conditions in between.</p>
<p>The passage notes that the nature of wind is to sway, leading to disturbed atmospheric conditions, while the lesser Yang energy operates centrally, thus ensuring the earth&#39;s energy remains properly aligned. The presence of wind in the skies causes it to rise high. When lesser Yang energy unites with extreme Yin, warmth follows suit. Clouds and rain occur because of the dominance of wind and fire. The convergence of these forces is described as harmony, responding to the brightness of certain celestial bodies. Political disruptions are attributed to winds, while the rapidity of actions stems from the influence of fire. The mixed grains indicate the first influence of the energy from the heavens at the springs, leading to ripening.<a id="trans-254p" href="#orig-254p" class="marker">[254p]</a><br>The term &quot;Jian Gu&quot; refers to the influences coming from the left, which is associated with the lesser yin, and the right, associated with the greater yang, where the energies of both sides converge. The ornamental horns of various creatures are born from the vitality of the heavens in the springs, but they are simply a manifestation of the nourishing essence, while the feathered beings cannot multiply and instead dissipate. The transformation following this leads to intense heat emanating from above, which compounds with the energies where they intersect. When hibernating insects emerge, water flows without freezing, indicating the presence of fire in the springs. When the wind energy is felt, illness arises from above; and when heat energy is felt, illness manifests below. If the wind and dryness exacerbate one another, the form becomes evident in the intersection of energies. In my humble opinion, the movements occurring above and below, referred to as manifestations in the middle, do not simply denote illness; they indicate the operations of wind and fire energies traveling up and down, intersecting in the center. The intense heat emanating from above follows the lineage from mother to child.<a id="trans-255p" href="#orig-255p" class="marker">[255p]</a><br>The victory of renewal is characterized by the return of the Yin energy downwards, returning to its proper state. Therefore, when Yin energy is at the spring, the earth&#39;s energy is in harmony. Now, since Yin energy governs the heavens and the atmospheric energy is also correct, this is referred to as the year of mutual correctness.</p>
<p>In the initial phase of energy, the cold begins to become austere, and the killing energy begins to arrive, causing the people to suffer from the cold beneath the right side.</p>
<p>(Note: The initial phase of energy is governed by the Clear Metal of Yangming; hence, the cold begins to become austere, and the killing energy begins to arrive. The people suffer from the cold beneath the right side, referring to the energy between Yangming and the spring, which is on the right of Shaoyang.)</p>
<p>In the second phase of energy, the cold does not dissipate, resulting in floral snow and icy water; the killing energy manifests, and frost begins to fall, which is named the upper combustion of the grass. The cold rains come frequently, and the Yang energy begins to transform, causing the people to suffer from internal heat.</p>
<p>(Note: The energy in the second phase is governed by the cold water of Taiyang; hence, the cold does not dissipate and frost begins to fall.)<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a><br>The energy of the second type is the fire of the Lord of Lesser Yin, while cold water is imposed above it; thus it is named the upper focus of plants, and yang transforms again below. Those among the populace who suffer from internal heat are afflicted by the energy of the Lord of Fire, as cold energy is congested within.</p>
<p>The energy of the third type, governed by heavenly authority, brings forth the wind at appropriate times; thus the people suffer from crying out, ear noises, and dizziness. </p>
<p>The energy of the fourth type involves unpleasant heat and humidity competing above to the left. People are afflicted with jaundice and swellings. </p>
<p>The guest energy of the fourth type is the fire of the Lord of Lesser Yin, while the primary energy is the damp earth of the Great Yin; hence the unpleasant heat and humidity are in conflict.<a id="trans-257p" href="#orig-257p" class="marker">[257p]</a><br>Those contending above the left are said to have the Minor Yin presiding over the heavens, which is the left of the Major Yin. The people&#39;s ailments of yellow, malaise, and swelling are all caused by damp heat. The five vital energies show that dryness and dampness are predominant, the heavy Yin is dispersed, the cold energy reaches the body, and wind and rain are moving. </p>
<p>Note: The guest energy of the five corresponds to the Tai Yin (great Yin) which is damp earth, while the main energy is the Yang Ming (yang brightness) which is dry metal. Thus, as dryness overcomes dampness, the heavy Yin disperses. When cold reaches the body, both energies predominantly govern coolness. When the Tai Yin has influence, it ultimately leads to rain, while the Yang Ming leads to desolation; therefore, wind and rain move.</p>
<p>The final energy fears the commanding fire; thus, Yang undergoes significant transformation, dormant insects emerge, flowing water does not freeze, the earth&#39;s energy is abundant, grass begins to grow, and people feel at ease. Their ailments are severe and warm. </p>
<p>Note: The final governing energy is the Tai Yang (greater Yang) which is cold water, while the rising fire presses strongly above, thus it fears the commanding fire. When the guest overcomes the master, the Yang energy undergoes significant transformation.<a id="trans-258p" href="#orig-258p" class="marker">[258p]</a><br>Flowing water does not freeze; when the lesser yang energy in the spring greatly manifests, the grass responds to the vital energy of growth and flourishes, while people feel the warmth and become at ease. Those suffering from intense warmth are what is termed winter warmth disease. One must eliminate the stagnant energy and support the source of transformation. Encourage the flow of vital energy to ensure that evils do not prevail. </p>
<p>The source of transformation refers to the five movements, which are the origins of the six energies. For instance, when the movement of lesser palace governs the ultimate yin, the earth energy becomes stagnant; when the movement of lesser merchant occurs, the lesser yang at the spring causes the metal energy to become stagnant. Therefore, one should alleviate the energy causing stagnation to nourish the transformation from the five movements. The six energies are fundamentally similar. When the yearly movement is insufficient, one must support the flow of vital energy to prevent those evils from prevailing over the insufficient energies. The above holds true for the three energies that are inadequate.</p>
<p>In a year, it is advisable to use metal to harmonize the upper aspects and salt to adjust the lower. Be wary of the fire energy and do not recklessly provoke it.<a id="trans-259p" href="#orig-259p" class="marker">[259p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: Xīn is transformed from metal to balance the dominance of wood; Xián transforms from water to temper the excess heat of fire. The Jueyin does not follow the standard reference but reveals the fire of Shaoyang from within; thus, in every year, fire governs. Therefore, one must fear the essence of fire and avoid reckless actions.</p>
<p>The year should utilize Xīn to balance the upper, while Xián balances the lower. Fear the essence of fire and refrain from reckless behavior. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Xīn is transformed from metal to balance the dominance of wood; Xián transforms from water to temper the excess heat of fire. The Jueyin does not follow the standard reference but reveals the fire of Shaoyang from within; thus, in every year, fire governs. Therefore, one must fear the essence of fire and avoid reckless actions.</p>
<p>Use warmth to counter warmth, heat to counter heat, coolness to counter coolness, and coldness to counter coldness. Eating should follow the same principles. If there are deviations from the norm, this is the way. Those who stray will face illness.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Jueyin governs energy; when using warmth, do so without transgression; Shaoyang governs energy; when using heat, do so without transgression. The principle of dietary methods applies to both food and medicine.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. The words of the Master are certainly comprehensive! However, how can one clarify these responses? Qí Bó replied, Indeed, a wise inquiry! The six energies have their sequences and fixed positions. Therefore, one should observe them at dawn on the first day of the first month and discern their positions to know their whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This refers to the celestial energies at the spring equinox. The six seasonal periods rotate with each having its designated position.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a><br>When the paths move in sequence, the right side of Shao Yang is governed by Yang Ming; the right side of Yang Ming is governed by Tai Yang; the right side of Tai Yang is governed by Jue Yin; the right side of Jue Yin is governed by Shao Yin; the right side of Shao Yin is governed by Tai Yin; the right side of Tai Yin is governed by Shao Yang. The six energies reach their end, and the six phases converge. Where there is a position, there are ranks above and below, and rules on the left and right, with each energy presiding over sixty days uniquely. When observing from the dawn of the first day of the first month, it is evident that Yin is the beginning of the year, the new moon is the beginning of the month, and Yin is the beginning of the day, marking the initiation of energy. By observing its heavenly overseer located at the spring, one can discern where the six energies are situated.</p>
<p>When movement is excessive, its arrival is early; when movement is insufficient, its arrival is late. This reflects the way of heaven, the constancy of energy. When the movement is neither excessive nor insufficient, this is called the correct year, and its arrival corresponds to the proper time.</p>
<p>(Note: Movement refers to the transformation and motion of the six energies. For instance, when the ages of Zi, Wu, Yin, Shen, Chen, and Xu are dominant, their respective affects arrive ahead of the seasonal times.)<a id="trans-261p" href="#orig-261p" class="marker">[261p]</a><br>If one is not in harmony with the years of the Rat, Rabbit, Rooster, Snake, and Pig in the six-year cycle, then the energy of that year cannot reach its master. The true year aligns with the time of the year&#39;s meeting; it is neither excessive nor insufficient, and its energy arrives in accordance with the time. The Emperor asked, &quot;Regarding the energy of victory and renewal, how can it be predicted when disasters occur?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;If it is not a transformation of energy, it is called a disaster.&quot; In this discussion on the prevalence of the five movements and the occurrence of disasters, the question is how to foresee them. What is called &quot;not a transformation of energy&quot; refers to a state not influenced by the energy of the cycles. For example, in the years of Ding Yin and Ding You, the energy manifests as a clear, warm wind. The wind represents the transformation of lesser angles, while the warmth signifies the energy of victory and renewal. This is considered a malignant transformation and is thus referred to as disaster.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;What is the relationship of the numbers of Heaven and Earth from beginning to end?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Indeed! It is a profound question! This is the way of illumination. The beginning of numbers rises from above and ends below. Half a year before, it is ruled by the heavenly energy; half a year after, it is ruled by the earthly energy. The interaction of up and down, the mutual influence of energies, governs everything. Thus, the year is completed. Hence it is said: can you know the positions of the luminous energies and the months? This is what is meant by ‘energy.’&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Heaven&quot; refers to the governorship of Heaven, &quot;Earth&quot; refers to the presence of springs, and &quot;Way&quot; refers to the way of the balance of Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth. The beginning of numbers rising from above means that numbers begin with one, starting from the heavenly one; it ending at earth means that the heavenly numbers begin with one and end at earth six. &quot;Half a year before&quot; and &quot;half a year after&quot; refer to the positions of energies in Heaven and Earth, showing their arrangement above and below. The mutual influence of energies means the intersecting of heavenly and earthly energies. &quot;Position&quot; refers to the governorship in the springs and the six positions of energy in the left and right. &quot;Energy and months&quot; refers to each energy governing two months.]<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;If I oversee this, then act accordingly; if it does not match the numbers, why is that?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The use of qi varies in quantity, and transformation has its rise and fall. The rise and fall correspond to transformation.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to understand this correspondence in transformation; how is it?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The warmth of spring transforms with the wind, the heat of summer aligns with dusk and the blaze of fire, and the victories and returns correspond. The dryness and clarity of autumn transforms with smoke and haze, while clouds and rain correspond with dusk and the lingering dust of late summer. The coldness with frost, snow, and ice transforms with winter. These variations of the five movements and six qi are governed by constants of rise and fall.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Not matching the numbers&quot; refers to not aligning with the six qi. &quot;The use of qi varies in quantity&quot; indicates that the application of the six qi can be excessive or insufficient. &quot;Transformation has its rise and fall&quot; signifies that the five movements&#39; transformations can be too much or too little. &quot;Wind, heat, and dryness&quot; refer to the six qi of yin and yang. &quot;Spring, summer, autumn, and winter&quot; correlate with the musical notes of jiao, zheng, gong, shang, and yu, which govern both the year and time. &quot;The warmth of spring transforming with the wind&quot; refers to the union of jueyin and the jiao movement. &quot;The heat of summer transforming with dusk&quot; relates to the union of shaoyin and shao yang with the zheng movement. &quot;Victories and returns&quot; correspond to the five movements of victory and return, which also relate to the six qi. For instance, the clear metal overcomes the wood of jiao; this overcoming qi aligns with yangming; the blazing fire returns over the autumn metal, and this returning qi aligns with shaoyin and shao yang. This is why there may be discrepancies: if the abundance of warm wind corresponds too closely to the flourishing of spring, then the qi movement aligns with its transformation. Conversely, if the six qi insufficiently matches the abundance of the five movements, and the decline of the five movements corresponds with the abundance of the six qi, then this rise and fall is in disharmony.)<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;The five movements that align with the transformations of heaven are called heavenly symbols; I understand this. I wish to hear about those that align with the transformations of the earth—what does that mean?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There are three that align with the transformations of heaven when there is excess, and three that align when there is deficiency; similarly, three align with the transformations of earth when there is excess, and three that align when there is deficiency. This amounts to a total of twenty-four ages.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear what these are!&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Jia Chen, Jia Xu, Tai Gong, which corresponds to the Tai Yin below; Ren Yin, Ren Shen, Tai Jiao, which corresponds to Jue Yin below; Geng Zi, Geng Wu, Tai Shang, which corresponds to Yang Ming below. Thus, there are three in total.&quot; 【Note: These three that align with the transformations of earth during excess involve the six vital energies, totaling six ages.】<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a><br>In the years of Gui Si and Gui Hai, with Lesser Movement, there will be a conjunction with Lesser Yang; in Xin Chou and Xin Wei, with Lesser Feather, there will be a conjunction with Greater Yang; in Gui Yin and Gui You, with Lesser Movement, there will be a conjunction with Lesser Yin. This pattern occurs three times. 【Note: These three do not correspond and transform in the same location, but they harmonize the six energies, totaling six years.】 </p>
<p>In the years of Wu Zi and Wu Wu, with Greater Movement, it will be influenced by Lesser Yin; in Wu Yin and Wu Shen, with Greater Movement, it will be influenced by Lesser Yang; in Bing Chen and Bing Xu, with Greater Feather, it will be influenced by Greater Yang. This pattern occurs three times. 【Note: These three are excessive and transform in the same sky, harmonizing the six energies, totaling six years.】</p>
<p>In the years of Ding Si and Ding Hai, with Lesser Horn, it will be influenced by Jue Yin; in Yi Yin and Yi You, with Lesser Commerce, it will be influenced by Yang Ming; in Ji Chou and Ji Wei, with Lesser Palace, it will be influenced by Greater Yin. This pattern occurs three times. 【Note: These three do not correspond and transform in the same sky, harmonizing the six energies, totaling six years.】 </p>
<p>Apart from these twenty-four years, there is no addition or influence.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a><br>[Commentary: At twenty-four years, both the upper and lower aspects experience influence; at thirty-six years, there is neither influence nor intrusion.] The Emperor asked: What does &quot;influence&quot; mean? Qibo replied: When there is excessive increase, it corresponds to the celestial decree; when there is insufficient increase, it corresponds to the yearly assembly. [Commentary: This speaks to how excessive increase corresponds with celestial decrees and insufficient increase corresponds with yearly assemblies.] The Emperor asked: What does &quot;intrusion&quot; mean? Qibo replied: Excess and deficiency both refer to the celestial decree. However, the variations in conduct differ in magnitude, the manifestations of illness vary in severity, and life and death are marked by early or late timings. [Commentary: The twelve years of excess and deficiency are all referred to as celestial decrees, yet within there are distinctions in the variances of conduct. The magnitudes refer to the variations of excess and deficiency. Excess is abrupt, while deficiency is gradual. Abrupt means severe illness, while gradual means long-lasting illness. Hence, there are distinctions between slight and severe outcomes of life and death.] The Emperor said: The Master spoke of using cold to approach cold, and using heat to approach heat. I do not understand this. I wish to know what is meant by &quot;approach.&quot; Qibo replied: Heat should not provoke heat, and cold should not provoke cold. Following the right path brings harmony, while going against it results in sickness.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a><br>One must not fail to respect and fear these (concepts) while keeping a distance. This is referred to as the six positions that arise in a year. </p>
<p>(Note: This passage generally states that within a year, there are six positions that respond to the seasons, each governing sixty days and eighty-seven and a half beats, each associated with four seasonal temperatures: cold, hot, warm, and cool. It is advisable to keep your distance and not interfere with them. For instance, in the initial phase, when the weather is still cold, it is appropriate to use warmth. During this time, the lesser yang is in charge, so one should avoid this position and not interfere. In the second phase, as the weather becomes warm, it is appropriate to use coolness; in this case, the greater yang governs, so again, one should avoid this position and utilize cooling instead. This applies to all six seasonal energies each year. Following the proper flow leads to harmony, while acting against it causes illness; one must respect and fear these energies and keep a distance.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about warmth and coolness? Qi Bo replied: If the energy is governed by heat, then use warmth without interference; if governed by cold, use coolness without interference. If governed by coolness, use coolness without interference; if governed by warmth, use warmth without interference. When energies are the same as their rulers, one should not interfere; when they differ, minor interference is allowed. This is known as the four fears, and one must be careful to observe them.</p>
<p>(Note: This discussion concerns the governance of heavenly energies in relation to the groundwater and the concept of non-interference. For example, when the lesser yin is in the higher position, and if it governs heat and warmth, one should also avoid this lesser yin warmth and not interfere.)<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a><br>Like the sun illuminating a spring, one governs the energies with coolness and employs the cool. One should keep a distance from this cooling of the sun and not transgress it. The same applies to all other energies. If the intervening energy matches the governing energy of the heavens in the spring, it must not be transgressed; if it differs, then a minor transgression is permitted. For instance, if the lesser yang governs the heavens and the initial energy is the lesser yin fire, then it corresponds with the energy of the heavens and one must not transgress its heat. However, if the lesser yin is in the spring with the four energies, and the greater yang is cold water, this differs from the governing energy, allowing a slight use of heat and a minor transgression. This is called the four apprehensions of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, which must be carefully considered. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! What about transgressors? Qi Bo replied: When the energies of the heavens oppose the seasonal timing, one may adhere to the season. Wang Bing commented that severe opposition is a sickness that can then follow the timing. In cases where one overcomes the main energy, a transgression is permitted. Balance is the benchmark, and one must not exceed it. This is termed the situation where the evil energy opposes and overcomes. </p>
<p>Note: When the energies of the heavens oppose the seasonal timing, such as when heat is governed but the heavenly energy opposes with coolness, one should adhere to the timing and employ warmth. If heat is governed while cold overcomes, one can use heat and transgress the governing heat.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a><br>The passage discusses the importance of maintaining balance with the natural energies and warns against excessive use that harms the original true essence of vitality. It cautions that if malevolent energies overwhelm, one can fall into danger. Therefore, it is advised to avoid losing trust in heavenly signs, to not oppose appropriate energies, to refrain from supporting harmful influences, and to not encourage negative cycles. This is termed the ultimate governance.</p>
<p>The &quot;heavenly sign&quot; refers to qi arriving at the right time without deviation that leads to wrongful actions. Each of the six energies has its proper conditions and should not be opposed. If there are prevailing energies, they should be restrained rather than supported. Likewise, if there are recovering energies, they should be suppressed instead of encouraged. Achieving harmony in the right essence ensures that above and below align with virtue, preventing disruption of order. When the five movements and energies are in balance, it is said to be the ultimate governance.</p>
<p>The Emperor then asks if the circulation of the five energies and their relation to the annual cycles has fixed constants. Qi Bo responds that he wishes to elaborate on this further.</p>
<p>This aligns with the previous section, which begins with the sun and arranges the six energies of the three yangs and three yins, as well as beginning with the angle movements and sequence of the five tones, noting that years do not always align evenly. Thus, starting with the heavenly stems at Jia and the earthly branches at Zi, each cycle completes after thirty years with Jia Zi to Gui Si; and again from Jia Wu to Gui Hai, completing a full cycle after sixty years. Accordingly, successful years follow this order.<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a><br>The upper aspect is Lesser Yin Fire, the middle aspect is Tai Gong Earth, the lower aspect is Yang Ming Metal, transforming heat into two. </p>

The Heavenly Stems begin with Jia, and the Earthly Branches begin with Zi, thus their numbers start from generation.]</p>

<p>Dryness transforms into four.</p>
<p>[Note: This refers to Ji Mao and Ji You. Ji indicates insufficiency, hence its number generates.]</p>
<p>This is called the proper transformation day.</p>
<p>[Note: There is no overpowering or returning malady in its transformation, hence it is called the proper transformation. The term &quot;day&quot; refers to one cycle presiding over one year, and the five cycles take the angle of Wood as the beginning and the feather of Water as the end, each governing seventy-two days with a quirk.]</p>
<p>The transformations involve upper aspects being salty and cold, the middle being bitter and hot, and the lower being sour and hot. These are termed medicinal foods.</p>
<p>[Note: The upper aspect refers to Heaven, the lower to springs, and the middle to transformation. The Lord Fire presides over Heaven, thus salty and cold balance the transformation. The Tai Yin moist Earth, transforming in the center, thus requires bitterness to dry and heat to warm Yin. Yang Ming is cool in the springs, thus requires sourness to help gather heat. Therefore, warming and cooling medicinal foods are both suitable.]</p>
<p>The years are Yi Chou and Yi Wei.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a><br>Above is the influence of the Great Yin Earth, in the middle is the operation of the Lesser Merchants Metal, and below is the Great Yin Water. The heat and cold transformations are both aligned; this is called the transformation of evil qi. </p>
<p>(Note: The operation that does not reach has a counteracting effect. When the Metal operation is insufficient, the heat overcomes it. The cold water of Metal&#39;s offspring returns with a counteracting evil qi, thus it is termed evil transformation. The &quot;sun&quot; refers to the prevailing qi present, overcoming its governing period of seventy-two days; the returning qi occupies the seventy-two days governed by myself. This aligns with the previous chapter on clear heat and mutual overcoming, expressing the operation of wind with clear heat. For years that do not reach this standard, the same principle applies.)</p>
<p>Disasters in the Seventh Palace </p>
<p>(Note: According to the division of the Nine Palaces, the seventh is the Dui Palace. When the Metal operation is insufficient, it leads to the overcoming of heat and cold, hence causing disasters and calamities. This is located in the western upper part of Dui, during an excessively productive year, resulting in illness among the populace. Hence, in years that do not reach the standard, disasters and calamities are discussed. The excessive qi is abrupt while the insufficient qi is gradual, causing significant ailments but minor disasters.)</p>
<p>Moisture transforms into the Five </p>
<p>(Note: The Yin signifies insufficiency, hence this number arises. When the Yin operation is inadequate, the heavenly overseers of the Ox and Sheep in the spring also signify insufficiency; such is the nature of qi operations.)</p>
<p>Clear transformation into the Four </p>
<p>(Note: The operation does not reach, hence this number arises. For years that do not reach this standard, the same principle applies.)</p>
<p>Cold transformation into the Six.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a><br>The Gengchen and Gengxu years are noted. Geng signifies excessive influence, thus its number is complete. This is referred to as the Day of Proper Transformation.</p>
<p>Humidity transforms to five, clarity to four, and coldness to six, all of which govern proper transformation without the邪气 of overwhelming return. The qi of the five movements further divides into the seventy-two days. The qi of the heavens, governed by the spring, presides over sixty days with exceptions. Thus, its transformation includes bitter heat above, sour harmony in the middle, and sweet heat below. This is what is meant by the appropriateness of medicine and food.</p>
<p>The metal qi signifies collection, hence the appropriateness of sour to aid in that collection. Harmony refers to the qi of the five movements; each governs a year, yet within a year, there are the five movements of generation, growth, transformation, collection, and storage, thus necessitating harmonizing with the five tastes. Sweet, representing the earth taste, can control and transform cold water.</p>
<p>In the year of Bingyin and Bingshen, the upper portion aligns with the lesser yang fire, the middle portion with the great feather water movement, and the lower portion with the Jueyin wood. Fire dominates above, and water controls it, thus signifying a lack of impact.</p>
<p>Coldness transforms to six. The movements are excessive, hence their numbers are complete. The remaining excessive movements align similarly. </p>
<p>Wind transforms to three, corresponding to the years of Xinsi and Xinhai. Sihai does not have sufficient influence, hence its numbers arise. This, again, is referred to as the Day of Proper Transformation. Above, it transforms to salty coldness; in the middle, to mild salinity; and below, to warm salinity. This is the appropriateness of medicine and food.</p>
<p>The water movement signifies salinity and assists with salinity. Subsequent transformations often utilize harmony for assistance. Taste is meant to alleviate stagnant qi and foster sources of transformation.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a><br>Upper Yangming Metal, Central Shaojiao Wood Cycle, Lower Shaoyin Fire.

<p>The Three Palaces are governed by Zhen, representing the eastern domain. Dryness transforms into the Nine. In the harmonious cycle, the upper Shang coincides with the Zheng Shang, hence it leads to completion. It is observed that when the Wood cycle is insufficient, the Metal qi dominates; now, with dryness approaching above, the Metal qi is indeed strong. </p>
<p>Wind transforms into Three, Heat transforms into Seven. This refers to Ren Zi and Ren Wu. Zi and Wu signify excessive conditions, hence this number is established. This is what is termed the correct transformation day. The transformation manifests above as bitter and slightly warm, in the middle as spicy and harmonious, and below as salty and cold. This is referred to as the proper medicine and food. </p>
<p>Wu Chen, Wu Xu year. </p>
<p>Upper Taiyang Water, Central Tai Zheng Fire Cycle, Lower Taiyin Earth. Cold transforms into Six. </p>
<p>Note that Chen and Xu signify excessive conditions, hence this number is established. Heat transforms into Seven, Humidity transforms into Five. </p>
<p>This refers to Gui Chou and Gui Wei. Chou and Wei signify insufficient conditions, hence this number arises. This is what is termed the correct transformation day. The transformation manifests above as bitter and warm, in the middle as sweet and harmonious, and below as sweet and warm. This is referred to as the proper medicine and food. </p>

<p>The transformation of wind is three—because the Si and Hai do not reach, thus their numbers generate. The transformation of moisture is five, fire transforms into seven—these refer to Wu Yin and Wu Shen. Since Yin and Shen indicate excess, their numbers are fulfilled.

Heat transforms into seven—because Zi and Wu indicate excess, thus their numbers are fulfilled. Clarity transforms into nine (the metal operation is excessive).</p>
<p>Drought transforms into nine—this refers to Yi Yin and Yi You. Since the records of transformation, the upper Shang coincides with the Zheng Shang, thus it indicates fulfillment. The essence of metal does not reach, but receives the assistance of operation and therefore flourishes similarly to the Zheng Shang. This is what is known as the righteous transformation day.

<p><strong>Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine - Volume 115</strong><br><strong>Gate of Qi and Fluid</strong>  </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Is the Qi of the five movements related to the year as well?<br><strong>[Note: This discusses the transformation of the five movements, which is affected by the heavenly influences at the spring, reaching its peak and thus reciprocating its yearly Qi. Therefore, it is said to counteract its excess Qi with the flavors it overcomes. One must not allow the excess to recur.]</strong><br>Qi Bo said: The peak indeed emerges, awaiting the right time to manifest.<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;May I ask what this means?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The energies of the Five Constants, when excessive or deficient, manifest differently.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear the details.&quot; Qibo said: &quot;Excessiveness leads to violence, while deficiency leads to slowness. Violence indicates severe illness, while slowness indicates lingering illness.&quot; </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;In terms of excess and deficiency, how are their quantities determined?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Excessiveness results in completion, while deficiency results in growth. The earth always promotes growth.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;At first, the vital energy is subtle, hence it is associated with deficiency; once it has matured, its quantity is abundant, hence it indicates excess. The heavens give rise to water, which the earth completes; the earth gives rise to fire, which the heavens complete; the heavens give rise to wood, which the earth completes; the earth gives rise to metal, which the heavens complete; the heavens give rise to earth, which the earth completes. The energies of the Five Elements are all influenced by the heavens in their emergence and by the earth in their completion. The earth nourishes while the heavens fulfill; this is the numerology of the He Tu. The earth is associated with growth due to its central position, responding to the heavenly stems and undergoing transformation.&quot;<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a><br>The energies of heaven and earth originate from the Five and culminate in the Nine; this is the significance of the numbers in the &quot;Lo Shu.&quot; Therefore, it is said: Between heaven and earth, there is nothing beyond the Five, and humanity should respond accordingly.</p>
<p>The ruler asked: What are the manifestations? Qi Bo replied: The soil is dense, the rocks and valleys tremble, thunder brings its energy together, dust dims the air, yellow and black transform into white vapor, swirling and rising high and deep, striking stones and flying into the sky; floods then arise, rivers spread broadly, and the fields and pastures become muddied. Transformations of air are therefore pervasive, bringing timely rain, marking the beginning of life, growth, change, and completion. Thus, when the people suffer from abdominal distension, with gurgling intestines, they count the following signs. If it worsens, they may experience heart pain and side aches, vomiting, chaotic digestion, and swellings that weigh the body down. Clouds rush, rains gather, and mists embrace the morning sun, while mountains and marshes are dimmed by dust. These occurrences arise from the Four energies; clouds cross the sky, ephemeral beings live and die, signaling premonitions.</p>
<p>[Note: The manifestations of the Five energies encompass changes in heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers; signs from plants, insects, and animals; calamities faced by the people; and shifts in cold and heat. Observing these manifestations allows one to understand their reciprocation. Thunder signifies the energy of fire, governed by the Third energy, while the Fourth energy governs earth; thus, the booming of thunder arises from the convergence of these energies beneath the earth, where fire and soil unite. White signifies the energy of metal, where earth expands and metal transforms. High and deep refer to the spaces between high mountains and deep valleys. Fields and pastures muddied refer to the floods that spread, akin to soil clods scattered in the fields.]<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a><br>The origin refers to the earth receiving energy from heaven, leading to the emergence and growth of the earth&#39;s essence, which is universally transformed by the earth. The illnesses of the people—such as abdominal distension and intestinal sounds—are all caused by the influence of the earth&#39;s energy. The four energies emerge at the transition between summer and autumn, characterized as the four energies. When the Taiyin reaches, it brings clouds and rain; mayflies are born in the morning and die by evening, transformed by damp energy. The moisture from the earth vaporizes to form clouds overhead while it transforms below, giving rise to mayflies. This signifies the onset of oppressive conditions. </p>
<p>The manifestation of metal-related disturbances—when the heavens are clear and the earth is bright, with a refreshing wind and sharp atmosphere—brings about a great chill. Smoke rises from grass and trees as the dry air begins to stir. With mist and fog appearing frequently, a murderous energy approaches, causing plants to wither; thus, metal begins to produce sound. Consequently, people suffer from coughing, reverse ailments, fullness in the heart and rib area, pains that worsen with movement, dry throats, and a pale, dust-covered complexion. Mountains and marshes become scorched and withered, with the earth crystallized by frost and salt. This signifies an outbreak, and there are five manifestations of this energy. </p>
<p>As night falls and white dew forms, the sounds of the forest become sorrowful, signaling the arrival of oppressive energy. </p>
<p>(Note: The bright clarity and sharpness are commanded by the energy of metal; the cold, dry, and lethal energy also belongs to metal. This response of the metal energy that has been stagnating indicates a restoration of governance. Coughing and a dry throat are ailments of the lungs. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that the lesser yang in the foot indicates movement, causing pain in the heart and ribs, preventing turning; in severe cases, the face shows a slight dustiness and lacks moisture. It also states that if the liver is active, it can lead to waist pain, dry throat, and a pallid complexion.)<a id="trans-288p" href="#orig-288p" class="marker">[288p]</a><br>When the energy of metal becomes abundant, it causes the wood of the liver to become ill. The soil that condenses like frost and salt refers to substances like Glauber&#39;s salt and nitre. The five energies are derived from the five elemental energies. The night brings dense white dew, indicating the dew&#39;s thickness like frost. The sound of the forest is sorrowful among the trees, signifying the voice of autumn. The stagnation of metal energy is a precursor to its release.</p>
<p>The stagnation of water leads to the emergence of yang energy, while yin energy surges violently. As extreme cold arrives, rivers and marshes solidify, and the cold mist forms into frost and snow. In severe cases, the atmosphere appears yellow and dark, and the mingling of energies results in frost killing. Thus, water reveals signs. Therefore, people suffer from cold-related heart pain, pain in the waist and lower back, and stiffness in major joints, leading to discomfort in bending and stretching. They also feel symptoms such as cold limb reversal, hardness in the abdomen, and fullness.</p>
<p>If the yang light is not treated, a vacuum accumulates with hidden yin, creating a haze of white dust. In such cases, the energy exhibits two forms of fire, front and back. The vast emptiness deep within signifies an energy that scatters like hemp. It is faint yet concealed, appearing dark with a slight yellow hue, indicating the precursor to stagnation.</p>
<p>[Note: The mingling of energies occurs between summer and autumn, following the fire of summer. Frost killing refers to frost formed from cold which destroys life. Signs indicate anomalies. The waist and lower back relate to the kidneys. Joint flexibility concerns issues with tendons and bones, where the kidneys govern bones and tendons belong to the joints. Cold limb reversal, hardness in the abdomen, and fullness indicate that yang energy is trapped while central energy is obstructed. The fire of the ruler governs the energies of two elements, while the fire of the minister governs the energies of three elements, exhibiting energy fluctuations before and after the two fires. The energy scattering like hemp refers to chilled energy that, upon feeling the fire energy, seeks to disperse.]<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br>The air is thick with the fragrance of wood, the vast sky is dim and covered in dust, disturbed by clouds and things. The great wind arises, causing roofs to creak and trees to bend; the wood begins to change. Thus, the people suffer from pain in the stomach and chest, with tightness in the sides, and difficulty in swallowing. In severe cases, there is ringing in the ears, dizziness, and an inability to recognize people, leading to sudden collapses. The vast sky is gray and dusty, with the Tianshan Mountain taking on a single hue; sometimes the air is murky and dark, yellow and black, thick and oppressive. Clouds hang low without bringing rain, indicating the impending change. The energy is erratic, the long rivers are overgrown with grass, tender leaves dappled in shadow, pine trees sing on high mountains, and tigers roar in the rocks, foreshadowing disturbances.</p>
<p>(Note: The annotations explain that &quot;the air is thick with the fragrance of wood&quot; and other elements denote the state of nature and its effects on health. The description reinforces that the wood element is in excess, leading to soil harm and various ailments, while the sounds of nature—like pines in the wind and tigers roaring—are signs of the coming change.)<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a><br>The outbreak of intense heat causes the great void to become obscured, the sun and moon lose their brilliance. The heat rises, signaling the arrival of the great summer, scorching the mountains and marshes, causing wood to weep, sending smoke billowing from vast roofs. The earth is parched, resembling frost and brine; stagnant water diminishes, creeping grass turns yellow, and winds carry confusing words, with dampness arriving late. Therefore, the people suffer from low energy, sores, abscesses, and swellings in the sides, abdomen, chest, and limbs; they feel bloating in their bodies, experience vomiting and reverse peristalsis, suffer from bone pain and joint movement issues, endure sudden abdominal pain and blood flowing uncontrollably, with diminished reproductive fluids and reddened eyes and heated hearts. In severe cases, this leads to dizziness and melancholy, often resulting in sudden death. This marks the culmination of great heat, causing sweat to dampen the lower abdomen. The heat causes a chaotic rise in energy, which then becomes calm again. When yang reaches its peak, it reverses into yin, and the dampness transforms and solidifies. Life-giving moisture turns to frost, mountains and rivers become icy and snowy; the fierce summer sun foreshadows tumultuous times ahead. </p>
<p>(Note: Great light refers to the brilliance of the sun and moon. The rising heat obscures their brightness. The description of the earth resembling frost and brine comes from the moist heat that rises, creating a frost-like substance. Confusing words refer to the chaotic way the heat spreads from the fires. The combination of wind and fire means that the damp energy lingers before transforming, leading to the various ailments among the people, all of which result from excess heat harming energy and blood. Low energy indicates that fire consumes energy. Dizziness pertains to lung issues. Excessive heat harms vital essence, which leads to sudden death. The term for the end signifies the division of qi which governs 60 days and 87.5 moments.)<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a><br>When the three phases come to an end, the great warmth will arise from the four phases. The original court is empty of sweat. Movement returns to stillness; when Yang reaches its peak, it reacts with Yin. The lesser Yin brings heat, which eventually leads to cold, as the lesser Yin follows both the essence and the sign. Humidity causes transformation and completion; the lesser Yang brings forth fire, leading to steam and humidity. Water freezes into ice and snow, signifying intense cold. The energy of light and vapor emerges from the condensed water. The heat of flames arises in the heat of midday lakes, where mountains and lakes share energy. This energy of the two fires is bound by the extreme accumulation of cold, and it will soon emerge again. There is an echo of responses followed by adjustments; all must observe the extremes before emerging. Trees sprout at times without fixity, while water follows fire.</p>
<p>Carefully observing the timing allows for ailments to be anticipated. Missing the timing results in a year of loss; the five energies do not flow to nurture, transform, and preserve, leading to an absence of constancy.</p>
<p>Careful observation of timing means illnesses can be anticipated and adjustments made in advance. Missing the timing means neglecting the moments governed by the five sounds and six energies. A reverse year disrupts the governance of nature during its cycle. When energies cannot harmonize, there will be no mutual support, and if the five energies do not flow, the five movements cannot be expressed, resulting in a disturbance of the usual processes of nurturing, transforming, and preserving.<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;When water causes hail and snow, when earth causes drifting and sudden changes, when wood causes destruction and collapse, when metal brings clarity, and when fire creates dimness, what force causes these phenomena?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The essence varies in quantity, and its manifestations range from subtle to extreme. The subtle corresponds to its essence, while the extreme encompasses its lesser manifestations, which can be understood by observing the lesser forces below.&quot;</p>
<p>(This explains the congestion of the five movements as influenced by the dominance of the six essences.) According to the discussion on the six subtle forces, one might inquire about the geographical correspondences and the positions of the six seasonal essences. Qi Bo replied: &quot;To the right of the prominent is the position of the monarch fire. To the right of the monarch fire, one steps back and is treated by the minister fire; move back another step, and the earth essence treats it; again, move back a step, and the metal essence treats it; again back a step, and the water essence treats it; one more step back, and the wood essence treats it; and again back a step, and the monarch fire treats it once more. Below the minister fire, the water essence acts; below the water position, the earth essence supports; below the earth position, the wind essence supports; below the wind position, the metal essence supports; below the metal position, the fire essence supports; below the monarch fire, the yin essence supports. This points to the positioning of the six essences, each having a supportive role below. Hence, it is said that by observing the lesser forces beneath, one can gain understanding. It denotes the subordination of the six essences below; thus, the appearance of hail and snow from the water initiation and drifting changes from the earth initiation becomes clear. The variation in essence denotes the energies of the five movements—which can be excessive or insufficient. The manifestations may be subtle or violent, with the substance corresponding to its intrinsic energy manifesting naturally.&quot;<a id="trans-293p" href="#orig-293p" class="marker">[293p]</a><br>Those beneath, when water rises, can endure the hail and snow belonging to earth; when earth rises, it can endure the gusts and flurries of wood; when wood rises, it can endure the destruction and breaks of metal; when metal rises, it can endure the clarity and brightness of fire; when fire rises, it can endure the dimness of water. The essence of distinguishing this chapter’s repetition lies in receiving the accumulation of the six energies, rather than the mutual overcoming of the five movements. The Emperor said: Excellent. What causes the energies to emerge inappropriately? Qi Bo replied: It is determined by discrepancy. The Emperor asked: Is there a specific number for discrepancy? Qi Bo answered: Typically, each is thirty degrees, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Position&quot; refers to the time governed by the five movements. &quot;Destiny&quot; means to command. &quot;Discrepancy&quot; indicates variance. The emergence of the five movements, when not at their original positions, signifies discrepancies in governance. For instance, water, positioned in winter, should emerge in the first and second months, but instead emerges early; earth, positioned in late summer, should emerge in the seventh and eighth months, but instead, emerges early; metal, in autumn, should emerge in the ninth and tenth months, but instead, emerges early; fire, in summer, should emerge in the seventh and eighth months, but emerges early. All emerge thirty days too soon, as accumulation leads to emergence, hence the slight delay from the original position.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about the timing of energy’s arrival? Qi Bo replied: If the movement is excessive, then arrival is early; if the movement is insufficient, then arrival is late—this is the norm of observation. The Emperor asked: What is it that arrives exactly on time? Qi Bo replied: If it is neither excessive nor insufficient, it arrives on time. Otherwise, it is an error.<a id="trans-294p" href="#orig-294p" class="marker">[294p]</a><br>[Note: This discussion pertains to the excess and deficiency of the Five Movements in relation to the timing of seasons. The &quot;Qi&quot; refers to the seasonal energies, while &quot;Transformation&quot; pertains to the changes brought about by the Five Movements. Each Movement governs a peculiar period of seventy-two days. If there is excess, then the Qi arrives prematurely; if there is deficiency, it arrives belatedly. This is the usual state of timing. If there is neither excess nor deficiency, then the Qi arrives at the proper time. Conversely, if this is not the case, then the energies of growth, transformation, storage, and collection will not align properly, resulting in calamities of the four seasons.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Excellent. Why do energies transform at improper times? Qibo replied: When there is excess, it aligns with the time, and when there is deficiency, it is due to its own dominance.</p>
<p>[Note: This discussion concerns the excess and deficiency of the Six Qis regarding the timing as well. Each Qi governs peculiar periods of sixty days. For instance, the pure and clear Qi operates in spring, the hot Qi in autumn, the cold and condensed Qi in summer, and the humid and steamy Qi in winter. This is known as transformation at improper times. The excess corresponds to the proper timing and each manages the cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. The deficiency refers to its own dominance. &quot;Dominance&quot; refers to the prevailing Qi, indicating the transformation out of season.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The Qi of the four seasons can be early or late. How do the variations in high, low, left, and right manifest? Qibo replied: There are both counterflow and flow, leading to delays and speeds. Therefore, excess results in transformation that comes earlier, while deficiency leads to transformation that arrives later. The Emperor said: I wish to know how this manifests. Qibo replied: Spring Qi moves west, summer Qi moves north, autumn Qi moves east, and winter Qi moves south.<a id="trans-295p" href="#orig-295p" class="marker">[295p]</a><br>Thus, the spring energy begins below, the autumn energy begins above, the summer energy begins in the middle, and the winter energy begins at the signs. Spring energy starts from the left, autumn energy starts from the right, winter energy starts from the back, and summer energy starts from the front. These are the regular transformations of the four seasons; therefore, in the highest places, winter energy is always present; in the lowest places, spring energy is always present. One must carefully observe this. The Emperor said, &quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>This discusses the energy of the four seasons, noting excess and deficiency. Drought arises from what comes before and what comes after. The natural order is that spring energy moves west, summer energy moves north, autumn energy moves east, and winter energy moves south. The reverse order is the inverse of this. Spring energy is born in the east, thus it travels from east to west; summer energy originates in the south, hence it moves from south to north; autumn energy starts in the west, so it travels from west to east; winter energy begins in the north, thus moving from north to south. This reflects the response of the four seasons to the four directions. Therefore, spring energy rises from below, and autumn energy descends from above; the fire energy of summer spreads out from the center to all sides; the concealed energy of winter returns inward from the surface. The left corresponds to east, the right to west, the front to departure, and the back to the abyss. This represents the high and low, left and right of the four seasons, indicating their regular transformations. Hence, in the highest places, winter energy is always present, representing the energy of storage, moving down from above and inward from outside. In the lowest places, spring energy is always present, representing the energy of growth, rising from below and outward from inside.<a id="trans-296p" href="#orig-296p" class="marker">[296p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;How do the responses of the Five Movements and Six Qi manifest? What are the principles of the Six Transformations and their periodic changes?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;The Six Qi have established principles and periodic changes; there are transformations and variations, victorious and returning phases, beneficial and pathological states, each differing in its signs. What does the Emperor wish to know?&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear it all.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: This discussion revolves around the Five Movements and Six Qi governing the seasons, each having its virtues, transformations, and regulations regarding victory, return, variation, and illness. The previously mentioned &#39;Initial Qi&#39; and &#39;Second Qi&#39; refer to the guest Qi from following movements, circling through the Six Periods, each with its distinct characteristics. This also reflects the governing energy of the Four Seasons: Spring representing Wood, Summer representing Fire, Autumn representing Metal, and Winter representing Water, each governing unique 72-day periods. Additionally, there are the Initial Qi governing Jueyin, the Second Qi governing Shaoyin, the Third Qi governing Shaoyang, the Fourth Qi governing Taiyin, the Fifth Qi governing Yangming, and the Sixth Qi governing Taiyang, each governing 60 days and specifically 87.5 units of time. These are the energies of the Four Seasons that do not change, along with their regulations concerning cold, heat, warmth, coolness, growth, and storage, thus called &#39;constant.&#39;)</p>
<p>Qibo continued: &quot;Allow me to elaborate. The influence of Qi manifests in different forms: Jueyin leads to harmony, Shaoyin to mild warmth, Taiyin to damp heaviness, Shaoyang to hot summers, Yangming to clear vigor, and Taiyang to cold atmospheres. These are the constants of seasonal transformations.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The influence of Qi refers to how the energies of the Four Seasons and the Five Movements relate to each other. The spring energy is gentle and late, hence the notion of harmony. Although Shaoyin governs Fire, it is fundamentally cold and thus regulates the transitions between cold and heat, overseeing mild energies.)<a id="trans-297p" href="#orig-297p" class="marker">[297p]</a><br>This section concerns the four seasons and their corresponding elements: the Wind Wood of Jueyin governs spring, the Fire of Shaoyang governs summer, the Clear Coolness of Yangming governs autumn, and the Cold Water of Taiyang governs winter. These are the regular transformations of the four seasons. The presence of Taiyin before Shaoyang indicates that the earth&#39;s energy is strong throughout the four seasons, beginning with spring and summer.</p>
<p>The domain of Jueyin brings forth Wind, and corresponds to the opening and splitting. Shaoyin brings forth Fire, leading to comfort and flourishing. Taiyin brings forth Rain, signifying fullness. Shaoyang brings forth Heat, denoting emergence. Yangming brings forth the office of death, signifying transformation. Taiyang brings forth Cold, indicating concealment and storage. This represents the regularity of transformations.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Office&quot; refers to specific functions or roles. The opening and splitting are related to growth. Comfort and flourishing imply expansion and prosperity. Fullness signifies completeness. Emergence denotes the outward expression from the center. Transformation signifies the changing nature of plants and trees in autumn. Concealment indicates that all things return and are stored in winter. Each of the three Yin and three Yang has specific roles associated with wind, cold, humidity, and heat, contributing to the transformations, hence representing the regularity of change.)</p>
<p>Jueyin signifies life, representing the shaking of wind. Shaoyin signifies flourishing, representing visible forms. Taiyin signifies transformation, representing clouds and rain. Shaoyang signifies growth, representing abundance. Yangming signifies gathering, representing mist and dew. Taiyang signifies storage, representing thoroughness. This illustrates the regularity of transformations.<a id="trans-298p" href="#orig-298p" class="marker">[298p]</a><br>The essence of growth and transformation is linked to the five seasonal energies. The wind, which shapes and manifests this essence, represents the consistent nature of transformation. </p>
<p>Where the Jueyin influence arrives, it causes the wind to arise, typically resulting in a dry atmosphere. The arrival of Shaoyin brings forth heat, leading to coldness. The Taoyin brings about moisture, ultimately resulting in rainfall. When Shaoyang arrives, it brings fire, culminating in steam and humidity. The arrival of Yangming leads to dryness, which eventually brings about coolness. Lastly, when Taiyang arrives, it induces coldness, which brings warmth in the middle. This is the principle of virtuous transformation.</p>
<p>All four seasons have airy influences capable of nurturing the myriad forms of life, yet they can also lead to destruction. Shaoyin and Taiyang are the masters of water and fire, yin and yang respectively. Taiyang indicates the positive and is fundamentally cold; Shaoyin indicates the negative and is fundamentally hot. Above Shaoyin, hot air governs, revealing Taiyang; above Taiyang, cold air governs, revealing Shaoyin. The interplay of yin and yang transforms, hence there is cold in the middle and warmth in the middle as well.</p>
<p>The wet earth energy of Taoyin rises, transforms into clouds and rain, resulting ultimately in precipitation. The fire of Shaoyang, which arises from the earth and marsh, culminates in humidity. The dryness of Yangming finally yields clarity and coolness. The living essence is attributed to the virtues born of the six energies, inducing characteristics of coolness and serenity.</p>
<p>Where Jueyin influences, it leads to fur-like transformation; where Shaoyin influences, it results in feather-like transformation; where Taoyin influences, it culminates in naked transformation; where Shaoyang influences, it leads to feather-like transformation; where Yangming influences, it leads to shell-like transformation; where Taiyang influences, it leads to scale-like transformation. This is the common principle of virtuous transformation.<a id="trans-299p" href="#orig-299p" class="marker">[299p]</a><br>The five types of insects are born and grow due to the influence of the five movements and six energies, hence they are the norm of moral transformation. The arrival of Jueyin results in generation and transformation; when Shaoyin arrives, it causes flourishing transformation; Taiyin brings about moistening transformation; Shaoyang leads to abundant transformation; Yangming results in solid transformation; and Taiyang causes concealed transformation. This is the regularity of governance. </p>
<p>The processes of generation, flourishing, moistening, abundance, solidity, and concealment correspond to the regulation of the six energies and are manifested through the four seasons. </p>
<p>The arrival of Jueyin brings about swift changes with fierce cold; Shaoyin leads to extreme warmth and cold; Taiyin results in sudden thunder and violent winds; Shaoyang leads to swirling winds and frost formations; Yangming brings scattered warmth; and Taiyang results in cold snow, hail, and dust. This reflects the regularity of atmospheric changes. </p>
<p>Swift changes refer to variations in wind, with cold representing the metal energy supporting it. Extreme warmth relates to the intensity of fire, while cold corresponds to the support of yin essence. Sudden thunder and heavy rain denote changes in damp earth, with wind energy reaching its peak. Whirling winds emerge from the union of fire. The intensity of blazing flames is supported by water energy when it reaches its extreme. Extreme dispersal denotes the harshness of cold, with warmth still being supported by fire energy. Intense cold, snow, hail, and severe cold are, at their peak, supported by earth energy. Therefore, at the extreme, energy transforms; transformation leads to harm, but support governs. </p>
<p>The arrival of Jueyin is characterized by movement and following; Shaoyin is associated with lofty flames and dusk; Taiyin is linked to deep shadow, dust, and darkness; Shaoyang corresponds to illumination, rosy clouds, and dusk.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a><br>Where Yangming reaches, it results in stagnation, frost, intense pain, and a mournful sound. Where the sun reaches, it signifies firmness, sharpness, and standing upright. This is the ordinary course of commands.</p>
<p>Where Jueyin reaches, it results in abdominal urgency; where Shaoyin reaches, it causes body heat and sores; where Taiyin reaches, it leads to fluid accumulation and obstruction; where Shaoyang reaches, it results in sneezing, vomiting, and ulcers; where Yangming reaches, it leads to floating emptiness; where the sun reaches, it signifies difficulty in bending and stretching. These are the common sicknesses.</p>
<p>Where Jueyin reaches, it results in limb pain; where Shaoyin reaches, it causes shock, chills, shivering, and delirium; where Taiyin reaches, it results in fullness; where Shaoyang reaches, it causes agitation, confusion, and sudden illness; where Yangming reaches, it leads to nasal and lower body illnesses; where the sun reaches, it causes lower back pain. These are also common ailments.<a id="trans-301p" href="#orig-301p" class="marker">[301p]</a><br>The places of the Jueyin lead to soft obstruction, the places of the Shaoyin lead to sadness and recklessness, the places of the Taiyin lead to fullness, chaos, vomiting, and diarrhea, the places of the Shaoyang lead to throat obstruction, ear ringing, and vomiting. The places of the Yangming lead to rib pain and skin cracking, while the places of the Taiyang lead to sleeping sweats and spasms. This is the commonality of illness.</p>
<p>[Note: This refers to common ailments in autumn. Obstruction relates to the difficulty in urination. Jueyin governs the benefit of the anterior yin; the meridians connect to the yin organs and are harmed by dry metal, hence the soft obstruction that hinders function. Encountering dryness due to dryness, the skin results in cracking.]</p>
<p>The places of the Jueyin lead to rib pain, vomiting, and diarrhea; the places of the Shaoyin lead to talk and laughter; the places of the Taiyin lead to heaviness and swelling; the places of the Shaoyang lead to violent convulsions and sudden death; the places of the Yangming lead to sneezing; the places of the Taiyang lead to flow restrictions. This is the commonality of illness.</p>
<p>[Note: This refers to common ailments in winter. The heart governs speech, and joy represents the heart’s intention; the sovereign fire is pressured by the cold water of winter, so the heart energy is firm, leading to an unceasing flow of talk and laughter.]</p>
<p>All twelve variations are responses of virtue with virtue, transformations with transformations, governance with governance, and orders with orders. High energy correlates with high, low energy correlates with low, posterior energy correlates with the rear, anterior energy correlates with the front, central energy correlates with the middle, and external energy correlates with the outside. This is the regularity of position.</p>
<p>[Note: Responding with virtue and transformations refers to the notion that spring has the transformation of harmonious growth, thus autumn bears the governance of mist and coolness; indeed, without victory, there cannot be recurrence.]<a id="trans-302p" href="#orig-302p" class="marker">[302p]</a><br>When the qi is high, it rises; when the qi is low, it descends. This means that in spring, the qi begins from below, thus the movement of qi is ruled by the wood of the negative yin; in autumn, the qi begins from above, thus the movement of qi belongs to the dry metal of the positive yang; in summer, the qi begins at the front, thus the movement of qi rules over the heat of the lesser yang; in winter, the qi begins from behind, thus the movement of qi belongs to the solid cold of the greater yang. These four seasons and six types of qi have their established positions and are not like the transient disturbances of external qi. Therefore, when wind prevails, movement occurs; when heat prevails, swelling occurs; when dryness prevails, there is dryness; when cold prevails, it becomes superficial; when humidity prevails, it becomes moist and leaks; if extreme, it can lead to water retention and swelling. The changes are described according to the location of the qi.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear about its application. Qi Bo replied: The application of the six types of qi each returns to being overcome and transforms accordingly. Therefore, the great yin transforms into rain and is applied to the greater yang; the greater yang transforms from cold and is applied to the lesser yin; the lesser yin transforms from heat and is applied to the positive yangming; the positive yangming transforms from dryness and is applied to the negative yin; the negative yin transforms from wind and is applied to the great yin. Each one is assigned its place as a means of verification. </p>
<p>This discussion pertains to the application of the transformations governed by the five elements.<a id="trans-303p" href="#orig-303p" class="marker">[303p]</a><br>The energies associated with their respective seasons are as follows: the energy of the Taiyin is present in late summer; the energy of the Taiyang is present in winter; the energy of the Shaoyin is present in summer; the energy of the Yangming is present in autumn; and the energy of the Jueyin is present in spring. Just as winter brings rain to signify the superiority of Taiyin, summer has its cold transformations to represent the superiority of Taiyang. This aligns with the understanding that spring surpasses late summer, and late summer surpasses winter.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What does it mean to be in one&#39;s rightful position? Qibo replied: To be in one&#39;s rightful position is to embody constant transformation. The Emperor said: I would like to hear more about this. Qibo explained: By determining their positions, it can be known in which month they reside.</p>
<p>The note clarifies that being in one&#39;s rightful position refers to the six energies of the four seasons, each governing its appropriate position, representing the constancy of seasonal transformations. The Jueyin is positioned in the first and second months, while the Shaoyin is in the third and fourth months. By identifying their positions and the corresponding months, the location of the six energies can be understood.</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired: What of the energies in their six positions? How do they wax and wane? Qibo replied: There is a great difference in their dynamics. The Tai signifies a slow and consistent rise, while the Sha signifies a rapid decline and disappearance.</p>
<p>The note explains that the six seasonal energies vary between fullness and emptiness, following the annual cyclical nature. If the annual cycle is excessive, the energies in their six positions will be full; if insufficient, they will be empty. The excess energy rises slowly and steadily, while the deficient energy comes quickly and briefly, hence it is said that the Sha signifies a rapid decline and disappearance.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked about the energies of heaven and earth.<a id="trans-304p" href="#orig-304p" class="marker">[304p]</a><br>What about the changes of fullness and emptiness? Qibo said: If the sky&#39;s energy is insufficient, then the earth&#39;s energy follows suit; if the earth&#39;s energy is lacking, then the sky&#39;s energy corresponds. The principles operate in between, and the celestial energy is often predominant. The unfavorable situations arise when energies cannot prevail, and they return to a common harmony, resulting in illnesses through the following and adapting to changes. Thus, when the upper energy prevails, the sky&#39;s energy descends; when the lower energy prevails, the earth&#39;s energy rises, differing in quantity. Minor discrepancies are small, while major discrepancies can lead to significant changes and shifts in positions. When energies exchange, major transformations occur, leading to ailments. The main point states: Major discrepancies are measured at five parts, whereas minor discrepancies at seven parts; their differences are observable. This is what is meant. </p>
<p>[Note: This discussion addresses the six energies of the seasons, also noting the distinctions between the fullness and emptiness of heaven and earth, and their mutual victories. Above the midpoint of the year, the sky&#39;s energy rules; below that point, the earth&#39;s energy is dominant. The principles reside in the midst of heaven and earth, consistently guiding the energies towards dominance. Therefore, it is said that following and adapting to changes results in illnesses. This refers to the energies of heaven and earth returning to harmonize in response to the prevailing energies and their mutual victories. The term &quot;energy exchange&quot; pertains to the interactions of the three and four energies. For example, if the sky&#39;s energy is insufficient, then the earth&#39;s energy will follow, thus the earth’s energy from soil will first interact with the fire of the sky; conversely, if the earth&#39;s energy is lacking, the sky&#39;s energy will follow, thus the fire of the sky first interacts with the soil energy of the earth. This union of fire and soil is termed a common harmony and represents minor victories. Minor discrepancies denote small differences, where the heavens maintain seven parts while three engage with the earth, and vice versa; this interaction does not lead to illness among the people.]<a id="trans-305p" href="#orig-305p" class="marker">[305p]</a><br>The evil that one cannot overcome is the energy of oneself that cannot be surpassed. When the sun cools, it applies to the lesser yin. When the yang brightness dries, it applies to the extreme yin. When the lower energies prevail, the earth&#39;s energy rises. The extreme yin transforms into wind, applying to the greater yin. The lesser yin transforms into fire, applying to the yang brightness. When the upper energies prevail, the heavenly energy descends, thus it becomes the greatest dominance. In extreme cases, there is a significant shift; significant shifts reside in the heavens&#39; cycle at five parts, directly descending downwards; in the earth&#39;s cycle, it resides in five parts, and it conversely rises upwards. Hence it is said, in extreme cases, the positions shift. When energies exchange, a great change occurs, leading to illness. The shift in position refers to surpassing the positions of three energies and four energies, while the initial two energies operate in the five positions and six positions, with the five energies and six energies operating in the initial and second positions. This dominance by the energy that cannot be overcome is termed as the evil that cannot be surpassed; it surpasses its position and adds to it, thus causing great changes. If it returns to harmony, then it does not exceed its position.</p>
<p>The emperor said: Good. It is discussed that heat does not invade heat, and cold does not invade cold. I wish to avoid cold and avoid heat, what should I do? Qi Bo replied: You ask wisely. To cause no heat, attack within to avoid cold. The emperor said: If there is no attack or cause, yet I still encounter cold and heat, what then? Qi Bo said: Cold and heat are internal thieves; their illness will worsen. The emperor said: I wish to hear about those who are free from illness, what are they like? Qi Bo said: Those who are free create life, and those who have it intensely suffer.<a id="trans-306p" href="#orig-306p" class="marker">[306p]</a><br>The Emperor asked: How do the living fare? Qibo replied: If one does not stay warm, heat will arrive; if one does not avoid the cold, cold will come. When the cold arrives, it causes rigidity, fullness and urgent pain in the abdomen, leading to diarrhea; when heat arrives, it causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dysentery, abscesses, confusion, convulsions, swelling, vomiting, nasal bleeding, headaches, joint pain, muscle aches, excessive bleeding, and urinary problems. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How can one treat this? Qibo replied: One must follow the seasons; those who violate this should be treated with the opposites. Notes: This refers to the six energies of the seasons; one should avoid the cold and the heat. The acrid and sweet disperse as Yang; therefore, illnesses that require dispersing should avoid heat. Sour and bitter bring forth as Yin; thus, if an illness requires purging, one should avoid the cold. If a person is ill but should not disperse or purge, and they act recklessly, cold and heat will invade within, worsening their condition. If one has no illness but does not avoid heat or cold, then rigidity, fullness, fever, and vomiting will arise. By &quot;time,&quot; it refers to the four seasons; for treatment with opposites, if one is affected by heat, treat with the cold that counters it; if affected by cold, treat with the heat that counters it.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What of women who are burdened? How should toxins be handled? Qibo replied: If there is an issue, it will not lead to harm; there is also no harm. The Emperor said: I wish to understand what this means. Qibo replied: It is about great accumulations; if they are disturbed, reduce by more than half and stop; exceeding this will lead to death.<a id="trans-307p" href="#orig-307p" class="marker">[307p]</a><br>This text discusses the accumulation of a fetus in relation to the dualities of yin and yang, and the distinctions between cold and heat that should be avoided. The weight of the body signifies pregnancy. Toxic substances are those that are extremely cold or hot. In the initial months of pregnancy, different elements govern the nurturing of the fetus: wood in the first two months, fire in the third and fourth months, earth in the fifth and sixth, metal in the seventh and eighth, and water in the ninth and tenth months. When the sun rises, the five elements complete their cycle, and yin and yang separate water and fire, forming the physical body after birth. However, before birth, the energies of the five elements may be either strong or weak, dominant or stagnant, and should be adjusted according to cold, heat, warmth, and coolness to maintain balance. If there are ailments, one may not escalate the exposure to cold or heat significantly, which would not harm the fetal energy. This indicates that despite potential issues, one should be careful not to excessively err, as this can lead to harm. The accumulation and gathering relate to the organs governed by the five elements, which must not be excessively exposed to cold or heat. If transgressed too much, the result can be fatal. Cold, heat, warmth, and coolness are considered the four fears, which must be approached with caution.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked how to treat severe stagnation. Qibo replied: Wood releases stagnation, fire stimulates it, earth takes it away, metal drains it, and water breaks it. It is essential to adjust the energy; if in excess, it must be reduced, since it is feared. This is referred to as draining. The Emperor then asked about false energy. Qibo replied: If there is false energy present, then there are no restrictions. This refers to insufficient primary energy and excessive guest energy.</p>
<p>This indicates the seasonal stagnation and the methods for adjustment and treatment.<a id="trans-308p" href="#orig-308p" class="marker">[308p]</a><br>When the oppression of the vital energies is severe, the Yin of the moon acts upon the Yang of the sun, leading to water stagnation; the Yang of the sun acts upon the Shaoyin, resulting in fire stagnation; the Shaoyin affects the Yangming, causing metal stagnation; the Yangming influences the Jueyin, resulting in wood stagnation; and the Jueyin acts upon the Taiyin, leading to soil stagnation. The method of adjustment is as follows: for wood stagnation, it should be relaxed; for fire stagnation, it should be dispersed; for soil stagnation, it should be removed; for metal stagnation, it should be drained; and for water stagnation, it should be redirected. However, when adjusting the defeating energy, if it is excessive, it should be tempered with its own fear, so that it does not return. What is meant by &quot;drain&quot; refers to draining the prevailing energy. This applies not as a strict seasonal victory—summer over winter, winter over summer, summer over autumn, autumn over spring, or spring over late summer—but rather indicates a deficiency in the main energy, with the guest energy prevailing.<a id="trans-309p" href="#orig-309p" class="marker">[309p]</a><br>The Wind and Wood of the Jueyin govern spring, while the Metal Qi of the Yangming approaches. The two Fires of the Jun and Xiang govern summer, while the Cold Water of the Taiyang approaches; the Wet Earth of the Longxia governs Qi, while the Wind and Wood of the Jueyin approaches; the Metal Qi of the Yangming governs autumn, while the energy of the two Fires approaches; the Cold Water of the Taiyang governs winter, while the Earth Qi of the Taiyin approaches. If one relies on these energies, then one can indeed manage the victory of the guest Qi with the balance of cold and heat, and regarding the cold and heat of the master Qi, there are no prohibitions. According to this text, the so-called &quot;Six Fundamental Regulations&quot; refers to the six energies termed the &quot;Six Fundamentals,&quot; while the Five Operations also respond to the heavenly elements and transform.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;Profound indeed! The way of the sages. The great transformation of heaven and earth, the timing of operations, the governance of principles, the administration of yin and yang, the orders of cold and heat—who can comprehend this if not you, Master? I wish to store it in the Linglan chamber, and label it: &#39;Six Fundamental Regulations,&#39; and I shall not dare to reveal it unless in fasting and prayer; careful transmission is essential.&quot;<a id="trans-310p" href="#orig-310p" class="marker">[310p]</a><br><strong>The Great Discussion of Ultimate Truth (Part One)</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor inquired: &quot;The five energies interact and alternately wax and wane; I understand this already. But what about the six energies that govern the heavens and the earth? What is their essence?&quot; [Note: This refers to what has been elaborated in the chapter on the six original principles, discussing the intermingling of the five movements and six energies, each having its excesses and deficiencies, and how they mutually influence one another. Now, I wish to discuss separately how the six energies that govern the heavens manifest in the springs.] Qi Bo responded with a deep bow: &quot;Your question is truly enlightening! The grand order of heaven and earth, the communication between humans and spirits.&quot; [Note: Wang Bing said: &quot;Though the changes between heaven and earth and the operations of humans and spirits are different, their mutual resonance is one.&quot;] The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to understand how the upper harmonizes clearly and the lower harmonizes obscurely. How can this be achieved?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;This is the source of the Way, and the uncertainty of the craftsman.&quot;<a id="trans-311p" href="#orig-311p" class="marker">[311p]</a><br>The note states: &quot;The clarity of aligning with the heavenly Dao is evident, while the depth of the mysterious is found in the springs. The Dao gives rise to unity; if its essence is not understood, it will disperse endlessly, hence the prevalence of doubts.&quot; The emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear about this Dao.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The Liver governs the heavenly influences and transforms them into wind; the Heart governs and transforms them into heat; the Spleen governs and transforms them into dampness; the Gallbladder governs and transforms them into fire; the Lungs govern and transform them into dryness; the Kidneys govern and transform them into cold. This is done according to the positions of the organs to determine the illnesses of individuals.&quot; The note explains: &quot;Wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire are the six climatic influences of Heaven, with the three Yin and three Yang venerating them, thus the six influences are the transformations governed by Heaven. When the heavenly influences align with the organs, they affect the individual&#39;s organ positions, causing illnesses according to the damage from the six influences.&quot; The emperor asked: &quot;How does the earth transform?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Heavenly governance is the same; the influences are all interconnected.&quot;<a id="trans-312p" href="#orig-312p" class="marker">[312p]</a><br>The Emperor said: What is the meaning of &quot;intermediary qi&quot;? Qi Bo replied: The one who manages the left and right is called intermediary qi. The Emperor asked: How is it different? Qi Bo replied: The main qi of the year records the year, while intermediary qi records movements. </p>
<p>[Note: This refers to the six qi controlling the heavens, which also encircle the earth, thus corresponding with the heavenly seasons; they revolve from the left and right, hence all intermediary qi is similarly affected. However, the heavenly management focuses on spring qi for recording years, while intermediary qi records movements, which are different.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. How does the master of the year operate? Qi Bo replied: The Jue Yin controls the heavens as wind transformation, in the springs as acid transformation, governs the qi as blue transformation, and intermediary qi as movement transformation. The Shao Yin controls the heavens as heat transformation, in the springs as bitter transformation, does not govern qi transformation, and places qi as burning transformation. The Tai Yin controls the heavens as moisture transformation, in the springs as sweet transformation, governs the qi as black transformation, and intermediary qi as soft transformation.<a id="trans-313p" href="#orig-313p" class="marker">[313p]</a><br>The lesser yang governs the transformation of fire in heaven, bitterness in springs, dan in qi, and brightness in interstitial qi. The greater yang governs the transformation of dryness in heaven, spiciness in springs, purity in qi, and clarity in interstitial qi. The greater cold governs the transformation of cold in heaven, saltiness in springs, origin in qi, and concealment in interstitial qi. Therefore, those who treat illnesses must clearly understand the six transformations for division, the five flavors and five colors that arise, and the suitability for the five organs. Only then can one speak of excess and deficiency, the connection to the emergence of diseases, and the threads of their origin. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;master of the year&quot; refers to each of the six qi that governs a particular year: wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, which are the six qi of heaven and hence are the transformations governed by heaven. The &quot;Chronicle on Heavenly Origins&quot; states: In the earth, transformation arises and gives rise to five flavors. Thus, transformation in the earth corresponds to the flavor transformation. &quot;Governing qi&quot; refers to the transformation of the qi of the five movements. The five movements are the qi of the five elements. By sensing the azure, red, black, and white of heaven&#39;s five colors, one generates the five elements of earth. This is why &quot;governing qi&quot; includes azure, red, black, and white, while the ruling fire illuminates in heaven and therefore does not govern the fire transformation in the earth.]<a id="trans-314p" href="#orig-314p" class="marker">[314p]</a><br>The so-called residing of Qi refers to the fact that the Lesser Yin does not govern the transformation of Qi. Among the six Qi, there are inherent positions up and down; thus, in the later section, the southern governance resides in the south, and the northern governance resides in the north. The actions of Qi such as movement, scorching, softness, brightness, clarity, and concealment are the functions of the six Qi. </p>
<p>The Emperor said, &quot;The Jueyin is in the spring and transforms into sourness; I have known this beforehand. How does the action of wind work?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;Wind moves on the earth, which is what we call the root. The remaining Qi follows the same principle. Rooted in heaven, it is the Qi of heaven; rooted in earth, it is the Qi of earth. When heaven and earth combine their Qi, the six seasonal divisions manifest, and all things are transformed and born. Therefore, it is said: Be diligent in observing the Qi; do not lose the opportunity of diagnosing illness. This is what is meant.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: This refers to the Qi of heaven being in the springs, both relying on the six Qi as the foundation. The six Qi circulate around the earth, moving up and down, and it is not the Qi that governs heavenly transformation, but rather the tastes that govern earthly transformation.]<a id="trans-315p" href="#orig-315p" class="marker">[315p]</a><br>The essence of the six qi derived from above is the qi of heaven, while that derived from below is the qi of earth. When heaven and earth combine their qi, the six seasons divide, and all things transform and are born. Therefore, one must carefully observe the appropriateness of the six qi, ensuring not to miss the ailments associated with the five elements; this is the key path to attaining ultimate truth. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What are the principal ailments? Qibo replied: When the year is managed and all things are prepared, there is no main ailment left. The Emperor asked: What are the things from the past year? Qibo replied: They are the concentrated essences of heaven and earth. The Emperor asked: What is the management of the year like? Qibo replied: To manage the qi means to oversee the year as a whole, yet there are both excesses and deficiencies. The Emperor asked: If it is not the matter of managing the yearly things, what does that mean? Qibo replied: It refers to dispersal; thus, the essence is the same but varies in quality. The flavors of qi have their thinness and thickness, their natures and uses have their restlessness and tranquility, the preservation of health has its amounts, and the powers of transformation have their depths and shallowness; this is what is meant. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Principal ailments&quot; refers to the medicinal substances used to treat diseases. &quot;Management of the year and preparedness&quot; refers to aligning with the six qi and five movements for readiness.)<a id="trans-316p" href="#orig-316p" class="marker">[316p]</a><br>When the Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang fires govern the year, one should gather warming items like aconite, ginger, and cinnamon. When the Yang Brightness dry metal governs the year, one should collect drying substances like mulberry bark and angelica. When the Greater Yin wind energy presides, one should harvest wind-related herbs like windbreak and notopterygium. When the Greater Yang cold water is in charge, one should gather cold items such as skullcap, lotus root, and rhubarb. When the Greater Yin earth energy governs, one should collect items like Chinese yam and polygonatum, which are sweet and neutral or sweet and warm, including grains of various kinds like coarse and fine. These all capture the essence of heaven and earth, so one first collects the seasonal items, which refers to preparing the essential items for the year, aligning with the earlier text that suggests consuming seasonal grains to preserve one’s true essence. The process of collecting energy involves the five phases of energy, which, while similar to the seasonal governance, still have distinctions between excess and deficiency.<a id="trans-317p" href="#orig-317p" class="marker">[317p]</a><br>The year of excess leads to abundant resources, while a year of deficiency results in scarce resources. If the forces that govern the year are not in place, then energy disperses and strength weakens. Thus, although the physical form remains the same, there are differences in energy and flavor, ranging from shallow to deep and thin to thick. The amount of treatment and preservation refers to the genuine medicine and food for curing diseases, which may require either increased or decreased usage.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, it was impossible to control the year and prepare resources, hence, processed methods were used as a substitute for the aid of heaven and earth. For instance, processing aconite is referred to as &quot;frying,&quot; while processing angelica and mulberry bark is also done by frying, essentially using fire to enhance fire and dryness to amplify dryness. Recently, aconite has been boiled in water and termed &quot;yin processing,&quot; and mulberry bark is mixed with honey and called &quot;moistening dryness.&quot; This is akin to using a hunting dog but removing its claws and teeth; if you send it to chase a rabbit, how can you expect it to succeed?</p>
<p>The emperor asked: What is meant by the internal harm of the year’s master? Qi Bo replied: It pertains to that which cannot resist the fated command; that is the essential matter. </p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the five operations of energy, governed by celestial influences over water in a victorious manner.)<a id="trans-318p" href="#orig-318p" class="marker">[318p]</a><br>The sovereign of the year rules over the six energies, while the internal organs correspond to the five elements and externally interact with the five movements. When the energies of the five movements are overwhelmed by the dominant energies, illness enters the five organs and causes harm. For instance, if the Lesser Shang metal movement coincides with the two fires in control of the heavens, or if the Lesser Palace earth movement coincides with the jueyin at the well, these are examples where the energies of the movements cannot withstand the dominant influences, thus leading to harm to the organs as a result of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How can this be treated? Qi Bo replied: When the upper influences are excessive over the lower, it must be balanced by the dominant; when external influences are excessive over the internal, it must be treated by the dominant.</p>
<p><em>Note: When the upper influences are excessive over the lower, it refers to the heavenly energies excessively overpowering the lower movements, which should be balanced by the dominant energies below. For example, if the Lesser Shang metal movement is overheated by the fire above, it should be balanced with the coolness of salty and bitter flavors.</em><a id="trans-319p" href="#orig-319p" class="marker">[319p]</a><br>When external influences surpass those from within, it is like the energy in a spring overwhelming the five phases within. One should treat it according to what is being overwhelmed. For instance, if the earth phase of Shao Palace is present, and the wind and wood are overwhelming, it would be advisable to treat it with coolness from辛 and support it with bitterness and sweetness. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. How should one balance the qi? Qi Bo replied: Carefully observe where yin and yang are located and adjust accordingly, aiming for balance as the goal. For what is excessive, one should suppress its influence and support what is deficient. For what is deficient, when the influence of what should not be exceeded prevails, one should counteract it with supportive measures. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Balancing qi&quot; refers to a harmony in the movement of qi, without any excess or deficiency affecting the phases.)<a id="trans-320p" href="#orig-320p" class="marker">[320p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;The Master speaks of discerning the locations of Yin and Yang and adjusting them, discussing how the human pulse corresponds with the measurements of the wrist, as if aligning threads of varying sizes to achieve balance. What then is the location of Yin at the wrist?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;By observing the direction of the year, one can know.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;I would like to hear this clearly.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: This continues from the previous text to clarify the location of Shaoyin. Among the five movements, Shaoyin does not govern the transformation of energy but follows the Yin and Yang of the six qi in their upward and downward, left and right movements; hence the question about the location of Yin. The sage stands facing south, with the front known as Guangming and the back as Taichong. The place called Taichong corresponds to Shaoyin, while above it is called Taiyang. Thus, Taichong represents the Kan position, and Guangming represents the Li position. Shaoyin governs the water of the heavenly one, while above it is the fire of Taiyang. Therefore, in the northern governance year, it aligns with the three Yins and is in Kan; in the southern governance year, it aligns with the three Yangs and is in Li. This distinction creates the concept of responsive and unresponsive. What is referred to as north and south pertains to Yin and Yang.]<a id="trans-321p" href="#orig-321p" class="marker">[321p]</a><br>In the five movements, Wu and Gui transform into fire, with the years of Wu and Gui representing the southern governance, while Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Ji, Geng, Xin, and Ren represent the northern governance. The governance of the five movements has both southern and northern aspects; the nature of the slight yin has both yin and yang, thus allowing for the movement up and down. The cun and chi measure the blood vessels; blood is the essence of the middle burner, flowing downward to become essence, nourishing the heart spirit, transforming into red blood. Therefore, the pulse starts at the foot&#39;s slight yin kidney and is governed by the hand&#39;s slight yin heart, hence the diagnosis of the cun and chi&#39;s yin and yang serves to assess the upper and lower aspects of slight yin.</p>
<p>The physician Qi Bo said: In the years of northern governance, if slight yin is at the pulse, then the cun will not react; if jueyin is at the pulse, then the right will not react; if taiyin is at the pulse, then the left will not react. In the years of southern governance, if slight yin controls heaven, then the cun will not react; if jueyin controls heaven, then the right will not react; if taiyin controls heaven, then the left will not react. Those that do not respond, if you reverse the diagnosis, will become evident.</p>
<p>(Note: Wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven; the three yin and three yang serve to manage the six qi of the year.)<a id="trans-322p" href="#orig-322p" class="marker">[322p]</a><br>Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of the earth, governing the transformation and movement of the five elements. The transformation occurs in five years, leading to a shift to the right, and among the five elements, there are two instances of fire; hence, the lord of fire does not govern the transformation of qi. However, despite not being in charge of movement, there is a position that it occupies. Above the lesser yin, the lord of fire presides, indicating that the lesser yin is rooted in yin and governs yang, thus the south&#39;s governance occurs in yang, while the north&#39;s governance occurs in yin. The celestial authority is positioned in the south, at the spring, and in the north; this establishes the orientation of heaven and earth. When a person faces south to diagnose, the inch denotes yang and is in the south, while the foot denotes yin and is in the north. In the year of northern governance, the lesser yin is located at the spring, and therefore aligns with yin in the north, resulting in the absence of pulse response at the inch. In the year of southern governance, the lesser yin presides over heaven, thus it aligns with yin in the south, leading to the same absence of pulse response at the inch. The absence of response indicates a weak pulse that does not register during diagnosis. This discusses the yin and yang of inches and feet, as well as the orientations of south and north.<a id="trans-323p" href="#orig-323p" class="marker">[323p]</a><br>In the year of northern governance, when the Yin is at the spring, then the Shao Yin is on the left, hence the right does not correspond; when the Tai Yin is at the spring, then the Shao Yin is on the right, hence the left does not correspond. In the year of southern governance, when the Yin governs the heavens, then the Shao Yin is on the left, hence the right does not correspond; when the Tai Yin governs the heavens, then the Shao Yin is on the right, hence the left does not correspond. This discusses the correspondence of the pulse at the wrist on the left and right sides. The non-correspondence refers to the left and right not corresponding. To reverse the diagnosis, one positions themselves facing south to diagnose the north. It is based on positioning the diagram flat on a table, with the heavens in the south and the spring in the north. In the year of northern governance, one faces north to diagnose; in the year of southern governance, one faces south to diagnose, thus the non-correspondence of left and right can be seen. Heaven above and earth below, the southern heavens and northern earth, this is the positioning of heaven and earth. When one faces south and north, they dwell in the midst of the exchange of the qi of heaven and earth, revolving in accordance with the qi of heaven and earth.<a id="trans-324p" href="#orig-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a><br>The Emperor said: &quot;What about the measurements?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;In a year of northern governance, when the three yin are below, the cun does not respond; when the three yin are above, the chi does not respond. In a year of southern governance, when the three yin are in the heavens, the cun does not respond; when the three yin are in the springs, the chi does not respond. The same applies to both sides. Therefore, it is said that those who understand the essence can conclude it in one sentence, while those who do not understand the essence will endlessly flow and scatter. This is what is meant.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: This summarizes the meaning of the previous text, hence the inquiry about measurements also encompasses the cun. The so-called &quot;three yin&quot; refers to Shao Yin, which occupies the middle position of the two yin. The terms &quot;above and below&quot; refer to heaven being above and springs being below. &quot;The same applies to both sides&quot; means that the chi’s responses on both sides are the same as those of the cun. Therefore, knowing the essence means understanding that Shao Yin does not control the transformation of qi, and resides based on the positions of yin and yang. Not understanding the essence leads to endless scattering, similar to the diverse and unfocused discussions in commentaries.] </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;Well said.&quot;<a id="trans-325p" href="#orig-325p" class="marker">[325p]</a><br>The Qi of heaven and earth is unrestrained, causing illness. How is this? Qi Bo said: In the year of the Jueyin, when the wind is dominant, the earth&#39;s Qi becomes unclear, the flat lands are dim, and the grasses sprout early. The people suffer from chills and shivering, they often stretch and yawn, experience heart pain and fullness in the chest, feelings of urgency in the sides, inability to eat or drink, obstruction in the throat, vomiting after eating, abdominal bloating, and frequent belching. When gas is released, they feel as if they are revitalized, yet their bodies feel heavy. </p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the influence of the six Qi on the people’s illnesses and how to treat them according to the prevailing Qi. Jueyin appears in the year of Yin and Shen. When the wind prevails below, dust and dirt rise, leading to unclear earth Qi, dim flatlands, and early sprouting of grasses. According to the channel text, spleen issues result in chills and shivering, frequent yawning, and stomach problems such as inability to eat or drink, nausea, bloating, and belching. When gas is released, it offers momentary relief, yet the body remains heavy, indicating water as a cause and soil as the afflicted area. Additionally, Jueyin liver channels reach the diaphragm and sides, causing symptoms like heart pain and fullness.]<a id="trans-326p" href="#orig-326p" class="marker">[326p]</a><br>In the Year of the Lesser Yin, when the heat overcomes, flames rise above the rivers and marshes, causing the hidden yin to appear bright. People suffer from constant rumbling in the abdomen, qi rushing up to the chest, and are unable to stand for long due to shortness of breath, alternating chills and fevers, skin pain, closed eyes, toothaches, swelling, aversion to cold, and fevers like malaria. There is pain in the lower abdomen, an enlarged belly, and insects do not hide.</p>
<p>(Note: The Lesser Yin refers to periods related to the year of the hare and rooster. The Lesser Yin fire is generated in the water, hence the flames rise above the mountains and marshes. The nature of the Lesser Yin symbolizes yin but is fundamentally fire, so the hidden yin appears bright. The constant rumbling in the abdomen is due to the agitation of fire qi. Qi rushing to the chest is the upward heat of fire qi. The inability to stand long due to shortness of breath, along with alternating chills and skin pain, is because fire overcomes the metal of the lungs. Closed eyes indicate severe heat and yin deficiency, leading to a fear of sunlight. Toothaches with swelling are caused by heat overwhelming the yang brightness.)<a id="trans-327p" href="#orig-327p" class="marker">[327p]</a><br>Fever resembling malaria is a disease of the qi of the Shaoyin. If the heat is in the lower jiao, there will be pain in the lower abdomen; if the heat is in the middle jiao, the abdomen will be distended. In the year of the Taiyin at the spring, grasses thrive early; when wetness overcomes, dust clouds the valleys and black is seen instead of yellow. At the transition of the extreme yin, the people suffer from accumulations of drink, heart pain, deafness that is muddled and unclear, swelling of the throat and throat obstruction, bleeding from yin disorders, pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, inability to urinate, headaches that push against the head, eyes that seem to dislocate, neck that feels pulled, waist that feels broken, thighs that cannot bend, hamstrings that feel knotted, and shins that feel distinct. </p>
<p>(Note: In the year of the Taiyin, it&#39;s the year of Chen and Xu. Earth nourishes grasses and trees, which is why they thrive early. Yellow is the color of earth, black is the color of water; earth overcomes dampness, hence yellow appears as black. The Five Constants Discussion states: Taiyin governs the heavens, and dampness descends; the kidney qi rises; black signifies the transformation of water, all representing the principle of earth overcoming water.)<a id="trans-328p" href="#orig-328p" class="marker">[328p]</a><br>The intersection of the ultimate yin is the convergence of the three energies and four energies; it is led by the earth element. Drinking and accumulating leads to heart pain, with cold and dampness prevailing. According to the meridian chapters, from deafness to throat obstruction, these are ailments of the Triple Burner meridian; from yin diseases to inability to urinate, this is due to pathogenic dampness flowing downward, causing illness in the kidneys; from head pain to feeling like a knot, these are ailments of the bladder meridian. The Triple Burner governs the flow of vital substances, while the bladder is the organ of water and fluids, and when the earth energy is excessive, both the water organ and the water&#39;s pathways become ill.</p>
<p>In the year when the lesser yang is at the spring, if the fire energy prevails, flames become prominent in the fields, and changes of cold and heat occur. The people suffer from dysentery with red and white discharges, lower abdominal pain, and red urination, which may even lead to blood in the stools. The lesser yin corresponds with this.</p>
<p>Note: The lesser yang at the spring occurs in the year of the snake and the pig. The fire of the lesser yang is generated from the earth, hence the flames are bright in the fields, and changes of cold and heat occur. Heat damages the blood level, leading to red discharges, while heat damages the energy level, leading to white discharges.<a id="trans-329p" href="#orig-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a><br>The heat resides in the lower region, hence the pain in the lower abdomen and red urine. In cases of blood in the stool, it can be severe enough for blood to emerge in the urine. The fire of the Shaoyin emerges from water, while the fire of the Shaoyang arises from the earth. Each has its own distinctions of yin and yang, cold and heat, thus correlating with the Shaoyin.</p>
<p>In the year when the Yangming is in the spring, if dryness and humidity dominate, then mist and fog will be clear and dark. The people suffer from nausea, with bitter vomiting, deep sighing, pain in the heart and sides, unable to turn over; in severe cases, the throat may feel dry and the face dusty, the body devoid of moisture, and the feet may feel hot externally.</p>
<p>(Note: The Yangming being in spring refers to the time of the year. When the metal energy is excessive below, there will be clear mist and fog above. According to the classic on meridians, symptoms include bitter vomiting, deep sighing, pain in the heart and sides, inability to turn, and in severe cases, a dusty face and a body lacking in moisture, with hot feet indicating Shaoyang disease; a dry throat and dusty face point to a condition of the Jueyin. This implies that metal excess causes liver and gallbladder issues.)</p>
<p>In the year when the Taiyang is in the spring, if cold and humidity dominate, there will be a feeling of heaviness and shivering.<a id="trans-330p" href="#orig-330p" class="marker">[330p]</a><br>The common people suffer from pain in the lower abdomen and pulling of the testicles, which leads to back pain and heartache. Blood is seen, the throat hurts, and the jaw is swollen. </p>
<p>[Note: The sun is in the spring, during the year of the Ox and the Goat. The cold water is excessive, causing tightness, somberness, and trembling. When cold invades from below, it affects the bladder and kidneys. The bladder is located in the lower abdomen, hence the abdominal pain. The kidneys govern the genitalia, thus the pulling sensation affects the testicles. The sun&#39;s meridian intersects the spine at the waist, which accounts for the back pain. The kidney meridian connects to the heart, hence the heartache. The heart governs blood, and with cold forces pressing in, blood is seen. According to the meridian passages, throat pain and jaw swelling indicate an illness of the small intestine. The small intestine is a viscera of the heart. This is also a result of water pathogens assaulting the fire organs and the heart. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;Good. How should this be treated?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The qi is in disarray, and wind lingers within. Treat it with acrid cooling agents, supplemented with bitter and sweet, using sweetness to ease it and acridity to disperse it.&quot;<a id="trans-331p" href="#orig-331p" class="marker">[331p]</a><br>Wind is the energy of wood; metal can overcome it, hence it is treated with acrid and cooling remedies. However, excessive acrid can harm the energy, so it is accompanied by bitter and sweet remedies, as bitterness overcomes acrid and sweetness benefits the energy. The intrinsic nature is urgent, thus sweet remedies help to soothe it. When wind excesses, acrid is used to disperse it. </p>
<p>When heat is excessive internally, it is treated with salty and cold remedies, accompanied by sweet and bitter, with sour to restrain it and bitter to release it. Heat is associated with fire energy, and water can conquer it, thus it is appropriate to treat it with salty and cold, complemented by sweet and bitter remedies. Sweet overcomes salty, to prevent excess of salt; bitterness can drain, thus reducing the substance of heat. Sour represents wood flavor; fire arises from wood, and to restrain fire with sour brings it back to its origin. When heat is trapped inside and does not resolve, bitterness releases it.</p>
<p>When dampness is excessive internally, it is treated with bitter heat, accompanied by sour and light, using bitterness to dry it and light to drain it.<a id="trans-332p" href="#orig-332p" class="marker">[332p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Humidity is the energy of damp earth; therefore, it is suitable to treat it with bitter heat. Bitterness can overcome dampness, and heat harmonizes with the yin. Acidity comes from wood transformation; thus, it is complemented with a mild sourness. The bitter and dry elements are transformed by fire. The hexagram texts say: nothing can dry up all things like fire. The mild flavor is used to drain; it represents yang through its penetrating qualities.</p>
<p>When fire is excessive internally, it is treated with salty and cold elements, complemented with bitterness and pungency to disperse it, and then sourness is used to contain it. Bitter elements are used to provoke it. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since fire is excessive internally, it should be treated with salty and cold elements. Bitterness can disperse, and pungency can scatter, thus it should be complemented with both bitterness and pungency. Sourness is used to contain it, and bitterness is used to provoke it, which corresponds to the previous text.</p>
<p>When dryness is excessive internally, it is treated with warm bitterness and complemented with sweet pungency, allowing bitterness to descend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Dryness is the clear and cool energy of metal; therefore, it should be treated with warm bitterness. Dryness leads to Qi being constrained internally, so it should be complemented with pungency and sweetness to disperse, allowing bitterness to descend.<a id="trans-333p" href="#orig-333p" class="marker">[333p]</a><br>Cold is pervasive within; it should be treated with sweet warmth, assisted by bitter and pungent flavors, to expel it through salty means, moisten it with pungent properties, and strengthen it with bitterness. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. What of the changes in the weather? Qi Bo replied: The Jue Yin regulates the heavens; when wind and dampness prevail, the great void becomes obscure, causing disturbances in the clouds. Cold arises from the spring qi, making the flowing water not freeze. The people suffer from pain in the stomach and heart, with pain in both flanks, obstruction in the diaphragm and throat, inability to eat or drink, a strong tongue with vomiting when eating, diarrhea, abdominal distension, watery loose stools, and water retention. Hibernating insects do not leave, and the illness originates in the spleen. If the Chong Yang is depleted, one cannot recover from death.</p>
<p>The note indicates that Jue Yin governs the heavens, as in the years of Zi and Hai. The wind and dampness above cause the great void to become obscure; disturbances in the clouds and cold arising from spring qi prevent the flowing water from freezing. According to the meridian sections, a strong tongue, vomiting when eating, stomach pain, abdominal distension, inability to drink, loose stools, and water retention are all ailments of the spleen meridian, as the overpowering wind and wood cause illness in the spleen. Hibernating insects hide in the earth; due to the external invasion of the wind qi, they do not leave. The Chong Yang, residing on the foot where the Yangming stomach meridian is located, corresponds to the arteries of the hands. With the stomach&#39;s qi extinguished, one cannot recover from death.</p>
<p>The Shao Yin governs the heavens; when hot and dampness prevails, the heat rises, and fire governs its affairs.<a id="trans-334p" href="#orig-334p" class="marker">[334p]</a><br>The people suffer from vexation and heat in the chest, dry throat, fullness on the right side, painful skin, chills and fever with cough and wheezing. A heavy rain is about to come; there is blood in the sputum and bloody discharge, along with nasal bleeding, sneezing, and vomiting. The color of the urine changes, and in severe cases, there are sores and swellings. Pain is felt in the shoulders, back, arms, and around the shoulder blades, with heart pain, lung issues, and a swollen abdomen causing wheezing and coughing. The illness originates in the lungs. If the pulse at the Chize point is absent, death is imminent.</p>
<p>[Note: The lesser yin governs the heavens; it corresponds to the time of the rat and the horse hours. The fire of the lesser yin arises from within, hence it causes vexatious heat. The lesser yin and the greater yang suggest that within yin there is yang and within yang there is yin. The interaction of yin and yang causes the fire to be intense, bringing forth heavy rain, leading to extreme cold that stirs up fiery heat. The people suffer from vexation and heat in the chest, dry throat, fullness on the right side, painful skin, due to the lung being affected by this heat, which inhibits the production of bodily fluids. Blood in the sputum and bloody discharge indicate heat driving the blood to erratically flow. Changes in urine color, shoulder and back pain, vexation, fullness in the chest, and lung distension causing wheezing and coughing are all indicative of lung-related illness. Excessive heat damages the metal element, hence the illness originates in the lungs. The Chize point is located within the inner elbow crease, where the pulse can be felt. It is the communicating vessel of the lungs. With the lung qi already exhausted, death is inevitable.]<a id="trans-335p" href="#orig-335p" class="marker">[335p]</a><br>The Great Yin governs the heavens; when dampness and indulgence prevail, it becomes heavy and spreads, causing rain to transform and vegetation to wither. There arise swellings, bone pains, and yin obstruction. Yin obstruction is characterized by an inability to be pressed upon. There are pains in the lower back, spine, and neck, frequent dizziness, and difficulty with bowel movements. When yin energy is unutilized, there is a lack of appetite even in hunger; coughing produces blood, and the heart feels suspended. The illness originates in the kidneys. If the Great Stream is exhausted, there is no cure. </p>
<p>(Note: The Great Yin governs the heavens during the year of the Dog or Sheep. Excessive dampness above causes heaviness and spreading, leading plants to wither. When the transforming energy of rain interacts, swellings and yin obstruction arise, resulting from the influence of cold damp energy. The obstruction is termed &quot;bi,&quot; thereby it cannot be pressed. The kidneys govern the bones, and the bladder is their organ, hence the pains in the lower back, spine, and neck. The kidneys open to the two yin, which also contributes to difficulty in bowel movements. When yin energy is unused, it cannot engage with the heart. If the upper and lower do not interact, the upper fire becomes retained in the stomach, leading to gastric heat, which causes loss of appetite.)<a id="trans-336p" href="#orig-336p" class="marker">[336p]</a><br>The stomach&#39;s qi is rebellious, hence the lack of desire to eat. Coughing up blood indicates that heart fire is rising, failing to connect the upper and lower parts. The Scripture on Meridians states: the kidneys govern movement; when the eyes fail to see, the heart hangs as if in hunger. This is due to the heart and kidneys not communicating, rendering the heart suspended above and feeling like hunger. The earth&#39;s dampness overpowers water, hence the illness originates from the kidneys. Tai Xi, the kidney&#39;s artery, is located above the outer ankle bone. If the Tai Xi pulse does not reach, then the kidney qi has already been depleted, leading to an untreatable death. </p>
<p>In the Lesser Yang, when fire has excess, warm qi flows improperly, and gold regulation is unbalanced. The people suffer from headaches, fever, chills, and malaria. Heat rises, causing skin pain, discoloration to yellow or red, progressing to water retention, swelling of the body and face, abdominal fullness with difficulty in breathing, red and white diarrhea, sores, coughing up blood, and a hot, restless heart. Ultimately, the illness stems from the lungs. If the Tian Fu is cut off, then death is inevitable. </p>
<p>(Note: Lesser Yang refers to the years of Yin and Shen.)<a id="trans-337p" href="#orig-337p" class="marker">[337p]</a><br>The fire&#39;s indulgence prevails, hence the metal&#39;s governance is not balanced. The fire of Shaoyang, in the heavens, brings the heat of summer; therefore, the people suffer from headaches and chills, and from malaria, as the heat rises causing skin pain, with color changing to yellow and red, indicating the fire&#39;s excess affecting the lungs. When transformed into water, it forces the metal and water outward, resulting in the illness of swollen water accumulation. When one breathes upward, the lung qi rebels and cannot settle. The discharge is red and white, with sores, cough, and blood in the sputum causing distress, indicating an excess of fire heat. Sneezing and nosebleeds can even affect the lungs. Since this fire&#39;s indulgence conquers the metal, the illness originates in the lungs. </p>
<p>The Yangming governs the heavens; when the dryness&#39;s excess prevails, the wood flourishes late, and grass grows late. The muscles and bones internally change, causing the people to suffer from pain in the left side of the abdomen, chills felt within leading to malaria, dry conditions altering seasons, coughing, gurgling in the abdomen, and clear watery diarrhea. The wood holds back life in the lower parts, while the grass wilts at the top.<a id="trans-338p" href="#orig-338p" class="marker">[338p]</a><br>The heart and sides pain violently, making it impossible to turn or move. There is dryness in the throat, dirt on the face, and pain in the waist. Men experience testicular pain, while women have pain in the lower abdomen. There are symptoms of blurred vision and sores. When stinging insects appear, the illness originates from the liver. If the liver channel is blocked (Tai Chong), it may lead to death without treatment.</p>
<p>(Note: Yangming governs the heavens during the years of Yin and Yang. When the dry metal triumphs above, wood is constrained, causing grass and trees to thrive later. Injury to the liver&#39;s blood weakens its ability to nourish the muscles and bones, resulting in internal changes. Pain in the left side indicates a liver channel issue. Catching a chill and developing intermittent fevers signifies autumn&#39;s fevers (Xie). Great cooling and transformation occurs at the transition between summer and autumn, from intense heat to coolness. Rumbling in the abdomen indicates coldness within. The name &quot;wood&quot; gathers above while decaying below, with grass withering upwards, as the chilling and killing energy dominates above. The violent pain in the heart and sides, difficulty in movement, throat dryness, and various symptoms all point to liver channel disorders.)<a id="trans-339p" href="#orig-339p" class="marker">[339p]</a><br>Gold floats above, thus the disease originates in the liver. Tai Chong is located two inches behind the base of the big toe; it corresponds to the liver channel&#39;s acupoint. When the liver qi is completely depleted, it results in death, untreatable. </p>
<p>When the sun governs heaven and cold prevails, then cold air returns, causing water to freeze. Blood undergoes changes within, leading to boils. The populace suffers from sudden heart pain, vomiting blood, blood leakage, nasal hemorrhage, excessive sorrow, and intermittent dizziness. When fire burns fiercely, storms arise, bringing hail. </p>
<p>The chest and abdomen feel full, hands are hot, and the elbows are swollen. The heart is faint and beating excessively, discomforting the chest, ribs, and stomach, with flushed face and yellowish eyes. There are tendencies to sigh and dry throat, and in severe cases, there’s a dark complexion and thirst with a desire to drink. The disease originates in the heart. When the Shen Men is depleted, it leads to death, untreatable. This is the understanding of how moving qi relates to its organs.<a id="trans-340p" href="#orig-340p" class="marker">[340p]</a><br>The note states that the arrival of cold air is referred to as the sun being the chief of all yang, representing the fire of the ruler. However, originating from the cold water below, the cold air now comes from above, resulting in cold both above and below, while the sun&#39;s movement resides in the middle, thus it is said to operate with intense fire. When cold comes from above, if the yang can overcome it, this is the so-called occurrence where injury from cold manifests as heat illness, which reflects a reversal of its essence, resulting in identifiable sickness. Therefore, treating the reversal of its essence leads to effective methods; this is akin to the sun acting based on its essence and the recognition of the overpowering forces of cold and heat. As a result, conditions like abscesses, vomiting blood, nasal bleeding, and abdominal fullness are signs of excessive yang heat. Similarly, symptoms like heart pain, dizziness, face redness, and yellowing of the eyes indicate that cold is attacking the fire of the heart, forcing its heat upwards. The conflict between water and fire, cold and heat, leads to the closing off of the Shenmen pulse, extinguishing the heart&#39;s energy. Shenmen, the heart&#39;s acupoint, is located at the tip of the bony edge of the palm, where the artery can be felt. Thus, monitoring the movement of the pulse indicates the existence or demise of the five organs. The emperor said: &quot;Good. How shall it be treated?&quot;<a id="trans-341p" href="#orig-341p" class="marker">[341p]</a><br>[Note: This discussion concerns the six atmospheric energies, where the excessive elements are balanced by those they overpower.] Qibo said: The energy of the heavens is overpowered by wind; balance it with acrid coolness, assist with bitterness and sweetness, use sweetness to mellow it, and use sourness to drain it. [Note: The energy from the spring is called excessive when internal and called treatment; the energy of the heavens is called overpowered when external and called balance. The atmosphere is external, while the earth&#39;s energy is internal. Therefore, to treat means to manage the inner and allow it to manifest outward; to balance means to level what is above and allow it to descend. Thus, in the case of the spring, it is said to disperse with acridity, while in the case of the heavens, it is said to drain with sourness.] The excess of heat is overpowered; balance it with salty coldness, assist with bitterness and sweetness, and use sourness to collect it. [Note: This treatment method is similar to that in the spring, but with slightly less emphasis on bitterness as a release. Since it arises from below and moves upward, the internal excess should be dispersed outward accordingly.]<a id="trans-342p" href="#orig-342p" class="marker">[342p]</a><br>The victory of dampness is countered with bitterness and heat, assisted by sourness and pungency, and managed with bitter drying and mild diuretics. When dampness is severe and accompanied by heat, it is treated with warming bitterness, complemented by sweetness and pungency, stopping with sweat as a remedy.</p>
<p>(Note: Dampness is the element of earth, thus when it is severe along with heat, pungent warmth should also be used, stopping with sweat as a remedy. &quot;Jinkui Yaolüe&quot; states: When there is swelling below the waist, promote urination; when there is swelling above the waist, sweating is required for recovery. These are essential methods for treating water and dampness.)</p>
<p>The victory of fire is countered with sourness and cooling, assisted by bitterness and sweetness, where sourness should contain it, bitterness should promote it, and sourness should restore it. The same applies to heat.</p>
<p>(Note: The fire of Shaoyang is the fire of the earth. When not balanced, it is due to internal excess. Therefore, it must be promoted with bitterness. This is the original energy of the Sanjiao, and it should be restored with sourness. Care should be taken not to let it excessively dissipate. The heat of Shaoyin represents the fire of the sovereign; when excessive, it combines internally and externally, and should also be resolved with bitterness.)</p>
<p>The victory of dryness is countered with warming bitterness, assisted by sourness and pungency, and managed with bitter diuretics.<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a><br>[Note: Bitter and warm can overcome clear and cold; pungent can moisten dryness. Dryness must be internally bound, thus it is released with sour and bitter. ] Cold and damp can be overcome by pungent heat, combined with sweet and bitter for expulsion. [Note: When dampness is internal, it interferes with the organs&#39; energy. Thus, as previously stated, use pungent to moisten and bitter to firm up. This overcomes external elements, so it is suitable to balance and drain them.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. If pathogenic qi prevails, how should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: Wind dominates the earth, and clear can overcome it. Treat it with sour warmth, assisted by bitter and sweet, and neutralized with pungent. Heat dominates the earth, and cold can overcome it. Treat with sweet warmth, assisted by bitter and pungent, and neutralized with salty. Dampness dominates the earth, and heat can overcome it. Treat with bitter cold, assisted by salty and sweet, and neutralized with bitter. Fire dominates the earth, and cold can overcome it. Treat with sweet warmth, assisted by bitter and pungent, and neutralized with salty.<a id="trans-344p" href="#orig-344p" class="marker">[344p]</a><br>When dryness governs the earth, heat overcomes it; treat it with balanced cold, supplement it with bitter and sweet flavors, temper it with pungent flavors, and harmony will yield benefits. When cold governs the earth, heat overcomes it; treat it with salty and cold properties, supplement it with sweet and pungent flavors, and temper it with bitterness.</p>
<p>[Note: When evil Qi overcomes, it refers to the improper Qi that overcomes in accordance with the yearly Qi of the water master, thus one should use the flavor of the overpowering evil Qi to balance it.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How should the evil victories in heaven be addressed? Qi Bo replied: When wind transforms in heaven, clarity overcomes it; treat it with sour warmth, and supplement it with sweet and bitter. When heat transforms in heaven, cold overcomes it; treat it with sweet warmth, and supplement it with bitter, sour, and pungent. When moisture transforms in heaven, heat overcomes it; treat it with bitter cold, and supplement it with bitter and sour. When fire transforms in heaven, cold overcomes it; treat it with sweet heat, and supplement it with bitter and pungent. When dryness transforms in heaven, heat overcomes it; treat it with pungent cold, and supplement it with bitter and sweet. When cold transforms in heaven, heat overcomes it; treat it with salty cold, and supplement it with bitter and pungent.</p>
<p>[Note: This discusses the six Qi governing heaven, and when evil Qi overcomes, appropriate flavors should be used to counter it.]<a id="trans-345p" href="#orig-345p" class="marker">[345p]</a><br><strong>The Door of Luck</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Ultimate Truth [Volume Two]</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: How do the six Qi overcome one another? Qibo replied: The victory of Jueyin causes ear ringing and dizziness, a feeling of wanting to vomit, and a feeling of cold in the stomach. Frequent occurrences of strong wind prevent the growth of parasites. The Qi of the liver and diaphragm gathers and transforms into heat, leading to yellow and red urine. The pain is at the heart of the stomach; there’s pain under the ribs, and sounds in the intestines with diarrhea. There is pain in the lower abdomen, and the discharge is red and white; in severe cases, there may be vomiting, and the throat is obstructed. </p>
<p>[Note: This discussion is about the three Yin and three Yang that dominate the Qi of the seasons, causing illnesses among the people. It is appropriate to balance the prevailing Qi and its flavors. Ear ringing and dizziness signify excessive Wood effects upwards. Frequent strong winds indicate overreach from below upwards. The feeling of wanting to vomit and a cold in the stomach signify a stomach illness. The non-thriving of parasites signifies that Wood tones it down. Gathering of liver Qi indicates a buildup. Transforming into heat with yellow-red urine reflects the excess of Wood creating fire. When wind and Wood prevail, the spleen and stomach are affected; hence, when wind Qi overwhelms upward, it leads to pain in the stomach and heart, and discomfort below the ribs. In severe cases, there may be vomiting and obstructed throat; when it overwhelms below, there are sounds in the intestines with diarrhea, pain in the lower abdomen, and the discharge being red and white—which refers to the harm done by wind, good at acting and changing frequently.]<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a><br>The victory of the Lesser Yin is characterized by heat beneath the heart, leading to a good appetite, along with a reaction below the navel and the qi circulating through the three burners. When summer heat arrives, the wood becomes moist, while the grass withers. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, irritability, abdominal fullness and pain, diarrhea, and the manifestation of red dysentery.</p>
<p>(Note: Heat below the heart leads to a good appetite; the external fire interacts with the internal. The reaction below the navel indicates the mark of the Lesser Yin, with the yin venting from below. The qi circulating through the three burners refers to the primary qi moving up and down, meeting in the center. The arrival of summer heat coincides with the interaction of the Lesser Yang qi. Wood becoming moist indicates nourishment from the Lesser Yin&#39;s yin fluids. Grass withering is a result of the heat from the two fiery elements above. Nausea and vomiting indicate the upward rebellion of yin qi. Irritability is a sign of the interaction between yin and yang&#39;s cold and heat. Abdominal fullness and diarrhea indicate the presence of cold yin below. The manifestation of red dysentery reflects the downward indulgence of the ruling fire.)</p>
<p>The victory of the Greater Yin is characterized by internal accumulation of fire qi, leading to sores and ulcers within, and spreading outward. The illness affects the sides of the body; severe cases involve hot pain in the heart, headaches, throat obstruction, and stiffness of the neck. Alone, it triumphs when dampness accumulates internally, with cold pressing down on the lower jiao, causing pain that radiates from the crown and pulls between the eyebrows, along with fullness in the stomach. When rain comes frequently, dryness transforms into visibility. Symptoms include fullness in the lower abdomen, heaviness in the waist and lower back, discomfort internally, leading to ease of urination or diarrhea, warm feet, heavy head, and swelling in the legs and shins.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a><br>Drinking rises from within, causing swelling above. </p>
<p>[Note: The moist and damp energy emanates externally, thus the heat energy is constrained internally, resulting in sores and ulcers within. When the damp heat energy spreads outward, it affects the wind and wood, leading to ailments in the ribs and flanks. In severe cases, it may cause heart pain, as the wood energy intensifies and transmits to the fire. Heat causing headaches, throat constriction, and stiff neck results from the mingling of wind-fire energy and dampness, rising from the neck to the top of the head. This speaks to the yin energy, which combines with fire and earth to manifest before mid-year. The dominant force afterwards is the damp and moist energy, which prevails post mid-year. The dampness in the middle causes internal stagnation that presses upon the lower organs. Pain centered at the top and drawing between the eyebrows indicates the wind-fire energy lingers at the crown, flowing through the yangming meridian and downward to congest the stomach. If rain frequently occurs and dryness is suddenly displayed, this condition appears at the exchanges of the four and five energies. Fullness in the lower abdomen and heaviness in the waist indicate the dampness rising and affecting the kidneys. Warm feet with heavy heads show the flow of wind-fire energy downward. Swollen shins and ankles are caused by earth and water intermingling. Drinking rises from within and swelling appears above, indicating the presence of water pathogens moving from the lower body, through the middle, to the upper.<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a><br>In the case of Lesser Yang&#39;s dominance, a hot pathogen invades the stomach, causing heart distress and pain, red eyes with a desire to vomit, sour vomiting accompanied by hunger, ear pain with red urine, easily frightened, and delirium. Violent heat causes consumption. Grass withers and water dries up, insects are forced to bend. Pain in the lower abdomen leads to red and white diarrhea.</p>
<p>(Note: The energy of Lesser Yang combines with the three burners, hence the heat residing in the stomach. The origin of the three burners emanates from the area of the stomach. The three burners connect with the pericardium, leading to heart distress and pain. The pulse of the three burners ascends to the ears, interlacing with the sharp corners of the eyes, therefore, indulgence above causes ear pain and red eyes, indulgence in the middle leads to sour vomiting and hunger, indulgence below results in red urine, lower abdominal pain, and red and white diarrhea. Easily frightened and delirious due to intense heat relates to the Yangming stomach channel&#39;s heat. The energy of the three burners steams fluids and transforms nutrients and blood. Consumption results from excessive heat harming the blood and fluids. Grass withering indicates heat above. Water drying indicates burning heat below. Insects bending represents heat present in the intersection of energies, where humans interact with heaven and earth.)</p>
<p>In the case of Yangming&#39;s dominance, clarity emerges from within. Left-sided rib pain and diarrhea occur. Internally there is a throat blockage, externally there is litigation-like hernia. Myriad coolness and coldness bring about transformation, while moths bring disaster. Discomfort in the chest leads to a blocked throat and coughing.<a id="trans-349p" href="#orig-349p" class="marker">[349p]</a><br>The cold and austere energy of Metal leads to clear qi emerging from within. When Metal prevails, the energy of Wood becomes deficient, resulting in side pain (inguinal hernia). When clear qi is abundant below, it causes diarrhea; when abundant above, it causes throat obstruction. The great chill is violent and extreme; thus, flowers and elegance change, and caterpillars bring disaster. When there are difficulties in the chest, with throat blockage and coughing, it is due to the dryness of Metal affecting the Lung, responding to corresponding energies.</p>
<p>When the Sun&#39;s energy prevails, it solidifies and arrives, leading to icy conditions out of season, thus transforming later. When hemorrhoids and intermittent fever arise, cold and restraint invade the stomach, creating internal heart pain; within, ulcers develop, and hidden pathways are obstructed. Yin regions pull at one another, causing muscular and tendon constriction, blood vessels become clotted and weep, affecting color change; it may cause blood to leak, the skin to swell, the abdomen to bloat with diminished appetite, with heat reversing upward, causing pain in the head, neck, crown, and brain orbs seeming to detach. When cold enters the lower jiao, it leads to profuse diarrhea.</p>
<p>The cold water energy of the Sun prevails, thus it solidifies and arrives. The out-of-season icy water implies that the prevailing energy was strong a year and a half prior, thus causing the insects&#39; later transformation. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that those suffering from hemorrhoids and intermittent fever are affected by the cold and hot evil of the Sun. When restraint enters the stomach, it indicates water insult to the earth.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a><br>The stomach channels connect upwards to the heart, which is why heart pain occurs. In the realm of yin, there are ulcers, thus causing hidden curves to be obstructed and pulling at the yin groin. The foot&#39;s sun channel governs the tendons, which is why the muscles are tense and rigid. Blood vessels swell and change color, possibly leading to a blood discharge due to evil entering the meridians. If the skin is swollen and puffy, it is the sun’s qi that governs the surface. If the abdomen is distended with reduced appetite, it is due to water qi overwhelming the spleen. When heat rises instead of descending, the sun’s qi follows the meridians up into the brain and then emerges at the nape. The sun meridians originate at the inner canthus of the eyes, which is why the eyes may appear dislocated. When cold enters the lower burn, the sun signifies warmth while fundamentally being cold, resulting in yang heat rising and yin cold descending.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How should it be treated?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;For the victory of Jueyin, treat with sweet and clear remedies, assisted by bitter and pungent herbs, and sour to purge. For the victory of Shaoyin, treat with spicy and cold remedies, assisted by bitter and salty herbs, and sweet to purge. For the victory of Taiyin, treat with salty and hot remedies, assisted by spicy and sweet herbs, and bitter to purge. For the victory of Shaoyang, treat with spicy and cold remedies, assisted by sweet and salty herbs, and sweet to purge. For the victory of Yangming, treat with sour and warm remedies, assisted by spicy and sweet herbs, and bitter to purge. For the victory of Taiyang, treat with sweet and hot remedies, assisted by spicy and sour herbs, and salty to purge.&quot;<a id="trans-351p" href="#orig-351p" class="marker">[351p]</a><br><strong>[Note: To treat various excessive conditions, warm the cold, cool the hot, clarify the warm, warm the clear, gather the dispersed, disperse the restrained, moisten the dry, soothe the urgent, soften the hard, harden the brittle, reinforce the weak, and drain the strong. When each condition is stabilized, pathogenic qi diminishes. This is the basic principle of treatment.]</strong> </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What about the resurgence of the six qi?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;What a comprehensive question! The resurgence of Jueyin manifests as a hard and distended lower abdomen, with sudden and intense pain. Like trees swaying and sand flying, the warmth of life is absent. There is pain in the heart, sweating, vomiting, and inability to retain food, which goes in and then comes out again; there is dizziness in the muscles and bones, and if there is severe cold, it may affect the spleen, leading to food stagnation and vomiting. When Chongyang is exhausted, it results in death without treatment.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The resurgence refers to the qi of the three yin and three yang being defeated by excessive conditions, leading to a buildup that then breaks out. A hard and distended lower abdomen, coupled with sudden and intense pain, indicates that Jueyin&#39;s qi is pent up and ready to erupt. Like trees swaying and sand flying reflects a strong resurgence of pent-up anger. When the warmth of life is absent, it shows the wind qi has emerged while the earth qi has weakened. Heart pain is characterized by a pallid complexion like that of a corpse, with an inability to take deep breaths, indicating that Jueyin&#39;s qi is affecting the heart.]</strong><a id="trans-352p" href="#orig-352p" class="marker">[352p]</a><br>Sweating indicates that the warmth of wind and heat is added to the Yin. Vomiting and inability to intake food suggest that excessive wood has caused the earth to fail. Muscle and bone pain indicates a surging of wind energy. Clear emptiness occurs when wind prevails above and Yin energy reverses downward. Pain due to obstruction is called Bi. The Chongyang is the artery of the stomach, and this indicates a surplus of wind energy while the energy of the earth is depleted. </p>
<p>The return of the lesser Yin brings internal heat, resulting in restlessness, sneezing, and cramping pain in the lower abdomen. Fire is seen raging; the throat is dry. Symptoms occur at intermittent times: energy moves on the left and rises on the right, leading to cough, skin pain, sudden mute episodes, heart pain, and mental confusion. There may also be chills and shivers, along with delirium, heat without relief, thirst leading to a desire for drink, shortness of breath, and muscular weakness. There is difficulty with bowel movements, external swelling, and belching. The red energy transforms behind, with flowing water unable to freeze. Heat energy spreads widely, insects do not reappear, and ailments like rashes, sores, pus-filled lesions, and carbuncles worsen, possibly entering the lungs, causing cough and nasal congestion. If the Tianfu point is blocked, it indicates a condition beyond cure. </p>
<p>(Note: Internal heat refers to oppressive heat. Restlessness suggests fiery irritability combined with an anxious state. Sneezing results from heat overwhelming the lungs. Cramps in the lower abdomen suggest the Yin energy of the lesser Yin is activated from below. The visible fire indicates the Yang energy rising from above. A dry throat implies the fire is excessively consuming fluids.)<a id="trans-353p" href="#orig-353p" class="marker">[353p]</a><br>If cold and damp are in the abdomen, it leads to diarrhea; when it gains the warmth of fire, the diarrhea stops. The minor yin manifests in both the root and the branch, thus diarrhea occurs intermittently. If the qi moves to the left, it indicates the yang fire rising from the water of the left kidney. If it ascends to the right, it shows the connection between the lungs and kidneys; the kidneys are the root while the lungs are the end. When fire affects the metal of the lungs, it leads to coughing and pain in the skin. Metal governs sound, hence the sudden loss of voice. Pain in the heart is due to self-inflicted fire damage. If one becomes depressed and fails to recognize others, it indicates chaotic cold and heat disturbances above. The sensation of trembling and chills represents the clash of yin and yang. If one feels blocked yet hot, it indicates that the cold of minor yin transforms into heat because of fire, resulting in thirst and a desire to drink. Weakness in the bones suggests that excessive fire leads to diminished energy, while extreme heat results in bone weakness. The small intestine, which is isolated, creates belching when its qi is obstructed, causing the reverse qi to ascend and produce a sound in the heart. The manifestation of red qi indicates a recovery in the five phases, hence water does not freeze. Rash and sores are due to heat harming qi and blood. The intense heat can melt metal, thus the heavenly repository is rendered ineffective. The return of the greater yin sees a transformation of moisture; the body feels heavy and full, food and drink do not digest, the yin qi ascends leading to chest discomfort, and fluid builds up within, resulting in coughing and wheezing sounds.<a id="trans-354p" href="#orig-354p" class="marker">[354p]</a><br>When it rains heavily, scales appear on land. The head and neck feel heavy and particularly painful, with vomiting and quietness; saliva is clear, and in severe cases, it enters the kidneys, leading to unrestricted leakage. If the Taiwei pulse is absent, there is no hope for recovery.</p>
<p>[Note: Extreme Qi leads to transformation; with excessive dampness, the body feels heavy and full, and food and drink do not digest. In the chest, the area known as &quot;Xuan&quot; is where the ancestral Qi resides; with Yin Qi rising in rebellion, discomfort occurs in the chest. Coughing and wheezing indicate fluid in the lungs. The appearance of scales on land signifies the earth&#39;s collapse. The severe heaviness and pain in the head and neck is attributed to dampness; the head feels wrapped, and since damp heat is not dispelled, the large tendons are short and soft, while the small tendons are elongated and relaxed; short and soft signify stiffness, and relaxed and elongated signify debility. Vomiting occurs due to dampness invading Yangming. Quietness indicates a desire to close the doors and windows and be alone. The chapter on pulses states that wanting to close doors and windows in emptiness indicates an imbalance between Yin and Yang. When Yang is exhausted and Yin is predominant, there is a desire to close off spaces. Yangming refers to the exterior Yang, while Taiyin refers to the three Yin channels. When Yin transforms and invades Yang, Yang tends to diminish while Yin thrives, resulting in the expulsion of clear saliva. In severe cases, it enters the kidneys, leading to the influence of the cold water of winter.]<a id="trans-355p" href="#orig-355p" class="marker">[355p]</a><br>The kidneys open to the two yin, hence it is called the &quot;orifice draining.&quot; The greater yin resides in the central earth and thrives in the four seasons, thus it conquers qi and overcomes in the four times of the year. The restorative qi is found after the midpoint of the year, so it only interacts with the autumn metal of the lungs and the winter water of the kidneys.</p>
<p>The recovery of the lesser yang brings extreme heat. Dryness and burning consume, and insects begin to deplete. Startled spells, coughs, and bleeding from the heart create heat and irritability, resulting in aversion to wind. The qi rises, making the face look as if covered with dust, and the eyes twitch. Internal fire erupts, leading to oral sores and vomiting, blood spilling forth. This can lead to intermittents, coupled with chills and trembling; extreme cold can turn to heat, causing dryness in the throat and insatiable thirst for water. The complexion turns yellow-red, and there is diminished strength and a sinking pulse, transforming into water retention, leading to swelling that can progress to the lungs, resulting in coughing and blood loss. The pulse at the wrist is absent, and there is no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Note: The fire of the lesser yang reemerges in the autumn and winter, hence the dryness and burning. &quot;Insects begin to deplete&quot; refers to withered wood and scorched grass leading to the depletion of insects. Startled spells and bleeding from the heart indicate heat invading the heart and lungs. Aversion to wind signifies heat within both the exterior and interior. A face that looks as if covered with dust indicates slight dulness. The lesser yang pulses in the hands and feet connect to the eyes, hence the twitching of the eyes.<a id="trans-356p" href="#orig-356p" class="marker">[356p]</a><br>When the fire energy arises from within, it is the yin fire manifesting internally. If it arises in the upper burner, it results in mouth sores; if in the middle burner, it leads to vomiting and nausea; if in the lower burner, it causes bleeding and diarrhea. When it manifests as malaria, it is governed by the shaoyang, which regulates the dynamics of cold and heat, yin and yang, and the external and internal exchanges. Extreme cold can turn into heat, leading to the transformation of fire. Constriction in the throat indicates injury to the lung&#39;s metal element. Thirst during water intake indicates dryness in the stomach&#39;s metal element governed by yangming. The damp earth of taiyin governs the four bodily energies. When the color turns yellow or red, it signifies the conjunction of fire and earth. If the qi and pulse are weak, both qi and blood are damaged. When it transforms into water, and leads to swelling and lesions, it comes from the interactions of the four energies and five gases culminating in the final qi.</p>
<p>The recovery of yangming involves a significant expulsion of clear qi, as the lush trees grow tall and strong, causing pests to become harmful. Illness arises with abdominal distension and pain; qi returns to the left side, leading to deep sighing, and in severe cases, heart pain along with fullness, abdominal swelling with diarrhea, bitter vomiting, cough, irritability, and headaches. In severe cases, it may affect the liver, causing fright and muscle spasms. If tai chong is blocked, it leads to certain death.</p>
<p>(Note: The commentary explains that the recovery of yangming occurs during its governing period, hence the expulsion of clear qi and the growth of sturdy trees, which leads to abdominal illnesses. The return of qi to the left indicates the interaction of metal and wood. Heart pain and fullness with abdominal swelling signify the interplay of fire and earth.)<a id="trans-357p" href="#orig-357p" class="marker">[357p]</a><br>Patients with gallbladder issues tend to sigh heavily, suffer from bitter vomiting, and are affected by wood suffering from the punishment of metal, which also causes sickness in the organs. Coughing up phlegm indicates lung Qi is rebelling. If coughing is accompanied by a feeling of heaviness in the heart, the illness is located in the diaphragm, where the Yangming Qi is reversing. Headaches are associated with the Jueyin disorder. When the ailment causes pain in the ribs, the headache is related to the liver’s meridian Qi; entering the liver can dry out the organ. A dried organ is half alive and half dead; although the pathogen may lightly disturb the organ, if the genuine essence is not harmed, one can still live. However, if the Taichong vessel is severed, the true essence is hurt. The recovery of Jueyin, Shaoyang, Shaoyin, and Taiyin occurs with the changes of the five and six Qi. The resurgence of Yangming and Taiyang corresponds to the Qi from half a year prior, which is why ailments of wood, fire, and earth occur.</p>
<p>The resurgence of Taiyang causes Jue Qi to rise, leading to condensation of water, rain, and ice, resulting in the death of insects. Coldness is generated in the heart and stomach, causing obstruction in the chest and diaphragm; there is pain and fullness in the heart, headaches that induce sadness, occasional dizziness and fainting, reduced appetite, and pain in the lower back that may refer to the heart. The earth cracks and ice forms, while sunlight fails to heal. There may be pain in the lower abdomen and a pulling sensation around the testicles that radiates to the waist and spine, pushing towards the heart. Saliva may turn clear, and there may be belching; in severe cases, it can enter the heart, causing forgetfulness and sadness. If the spirit gate is obstructed, it leads to a condition that is incurable.</p>
<p>(Note: The phrase &quot;Jue Qi rising&quot; refers to the upward movement of stagnant Qi, as it seeks to revert to the conditions of half a year prior.)<a id="trans-358p" href="#orig-358p" class="marker">[358p]</a><br>Water condenses, with moisture descending. Rain and ice signify coldness above. With cold present above and below, winged insects perish, as cold penetrates and extinguishes warmth. The heart and stomach become cold, causing obstruction in the chest and diaphragm, pain in the heart with fullness, headaches and feelings of sadness, and dizziness leading to fainting, where qi rises from below to the center and then upwards. Eating less leads to fluid overwhelming the earth element. Pain in the lower back and ribs, with difficulty in bending and stretching, arises from cold’s excessive influence causing self-harm. If yang fails to treat, the wood and fire elements weaken. Pain in the lower abdomen affecting the waist and spine that rises to the heart indicates a condition of the jueyin. Spitting clear water and experiencing belching arise from the stomach rising to the heart, reflecting a counteraction from earlier wood, fire, and earth elements of half a year prior.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. How should it be treated? Qi Bo replied: For the revival of jueyin, treat with sour and cold, assisted by sweet and spicy, using sour to drain it and sweet to ease it. For the revival of shaoyin, treat with salty and cold, assisted by bitter and spicy, using sweet to drain and sour to gather, with spicy and bitter to disperse, and salty to soften. For the revival of taiyin, treat with bitter and warm, assisted by sour and spicy, to drain, dry, and expel. For the revival of shaoyang, treat with salty and cool, assisted by bitter and spicy, using salty to soften, sour to gather, and spicy and bitter to disperse.<a id="trans-359p" href="#orig-359p" class="marker">[359p]</a><br>Heat that does not extend far should not disturb the coolness; treat the lesser yin accordingly. For the recovery of the yangming, use warming methods with acrid herbs and assist with bitter and sweet elements, applying bitterness to promote urination and defecation, while using sourness to replenish. For the recovery of the taiyang, use salty and warming treatments, complemented by sweet and acrid herbs, and bitterness to strengthen.</p>
<p>In reference to the previous section, it is stated that when expressing heat that does not extend far, it attacks the interior without venturing into coldness. This is similar to the fires of the lesser yang and lesser yin being stagnant and unresolved, which makes it appropriate to release the heat while avoiding a disturbance of coolness. The four types of qi should be cool, while the five should be warm; only when reaching the final qi may heat be applied. One must not disregard the seasonal influences.</p>
<p>In treating various manifestations of recovery: heat should be countered with cold, cold with heat, warm with clarity, and clear with warmth; what disperses should be consolidated, what is restrained should be released, dryness should be moistened, urgency should be soothed, hardness softened, fragility solidified, deficiencies supplemented, and strengths drained. Each should maintain their essence, ensuring clarity and tranquility, so that the pathogenic qi diminishes and returns to its origin. This is the overarching principle of treatment.<a id="trans-360p" href="#orig-360p" class="marker">[360p]</a><br>【Note: Among the five tastes and six qi, pungent and sweet are yang, sour and bitter are yin, salty taste is a release of yin, and bland taste seeps as yang. The six can either gather or disperse, be slow or rapid, dry or moist, soft or firm; there are both tonifying and purging effects, oppositional and conforming. Each corresponds to what is appropriate within the five elements and six qi, ensuring that the victorious and restorative qi is tranquil and pure, leading to a decline in disease qi and allowing each to reside in its natural position. This is the essence of healing.】 The Emperor said: &quot;Good. What is meant by the qi above and below?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Above half of the body, there are three types of qi; this is the division of the heavens, with heavenly qi being the master. Below half of the body, there are also three types of qi; this is the division of the earth, with earthly qi being the master. By naming and commanding qi, and directing qi to places, we discuss illness. The halfway point is known as Tianshu.&quot; 【Note: This discussion refers to the upper and lower parts of the human body corresponding to those of heaven and earth. Above the halfway point, heavenly qi is dominant, consisting of Jueyin Wind Wood, Shaoyin Fire, and Shaoyang Fire. Below the halfway point, earthly qi is dominant, consisting of Taiyin Wet Earth, Yangming Dry Metal, and Taiyang Cold Water. In the human body, the qi of Jueyin Wind Wood meets with the Du meridian at the top, where the wood qi is above the fire qi. Below the Lord Fire, the enveloping ministerial fire commands qi, indicating that the three types of qi of wood and fire are situated above half of the body.】<a id="trans-361p" href="#orig-361p" class="marker">[361p]</a><br>The Spleen, representing Earth, is positioned above the Stomach, which is associated with Metal, while the Yangming is located above the Taiyang Bladder. These represent the three energies of Earth, Metal, and Water, which reside below the midpoint of the body. By naming the upper and lower three energies as Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water, and identifying their existence in the heavens and the earth, we can understand the conditions of the three Yin and three Yang. The midpoint, referred to as the Heavenly Pivot, is located two inches beside the navel, marking the area of the Yangming. This serves to differentiate the upper and lower parts of the body. The term &quot;pivot&quot; signifies the interchanging and rotating nature of the upper and lower energies. Thus, in the realm of heaven and earth, the Heavenly Pivot is named within the interplay of these energies; in the human body, it is named as the midpoint. Therefore, when the upper energies prevail and the lower energies are both afflicted, it is named after the earth; when the lower energies prevail and the upper energies are both afflicted, it is named after the heavens. </p>
<p>(Note: This discusses the supremacy of energies above and below. For instance, if the Wood and Fire energies above the midpoint prevail while the three energies of Earth, Metal, and Water below are afflicted, it is referred to as a disease based on its earthly nature.)<a id="trans-362p" href="#orig-362p" class="marker">[362p]</a><br>If the earth, metal, and water of the lower half of the body prevail, while the wood, fire, and qi of the upper half are in a state of illness, this is named after heaven, signifying the illness’s presence in heaven. This is based on the correspondence between the upper and lower parts of the human body and the upper and lower realms of heaven and earth, hence the terminology related to heaven and earth. </p>
<p>Regarding what is referred to as &quot;arrival of victory,&quot; this means that the retaliatory qi is subdued and has yet to manifest. When it returns, it is not named differently than heaven and earth; it operates according to the principle of returning qi. </p>
<p>This refers to the returning qi of the upper and lower aspects. When victory arrives, the retaliatory qi is subdued in its original state and not yet released; when it returns, it acts like returning qi and does not require different names based on heaven and earth. For instance, in the case of the lesser yin, lesser yang, and so on, when their qi manifests in relation to the four and five phases, the yangming and taiyang cycles cause their qi to return to initial energies of wood and fire. Thus, it is unnecessary to designate wood and fire to the upper half of the year and name it after heaven; rather, metal and water, governing the lower half of the year, are named after earth. Everything is based on the location of the returning qi and the established principle.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;Is the movement of victory and return constant with time? Is it necessary for qi to be so?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There is a constant position in time, but qi is not necessarily fixed.&quot; The Emperor expressed his desire to understand the way. Qi Bo explained: &quot;Initial qi culminates in the three qi, governed by heavenly qi, which is the constancy of victory. When the four qi terminate in the completing qi, it is governed by earthly qi, which is the constancy of return. Where there is victory, there is return; where there is no victory, there is none.&quot;<a id="trans-363p" href="#orig-363p" class="marker">[363p]</a><br>The Emperor asked, &quot;Is the qi of victory and recovery in accordance with the fixed positions of the four seasons? Can this qi move according to the inevitability of the four seasons?&quot; Bo said, &quot;The wood, fire, earth, metal, and water of the four seasons have their predetermined locations, but the qi of victory and recovery does not emerge from its principal position; therefore, it cannot be certain. It is said that each of the six qi governs a year, and if the qi of that year is victorious, it will emerge as spring approaches, guided by the qi of Taiyin, Yangming, and Taiyang, all of which arise in spring and summer. As for the return of the six qi, they manifest only after they have reached their peak, hence they emerge after the middle of the year, where the recovery of Jueyin, Shaoyin, and Shaoyang occurs in autumn and winter. Thus, it is said that the initial qi lasts for three periods, governed by the heavenly qi, and this is the norm of victory. The four qi reach their conclusion with the ending qi, which is governed by the earthly qi, and this is the norm of recovery. Where there is victory, there is recovery; where there is no victory, there is none. Therefore, the qi of victory and recovery does not adhere strictly to the fixed positions of the four seasons and cannot be deemed certain.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said, &quot;Good. What happens after recovery and victory?&quot; Qibo replied, &quot;When victory arrives, recovery follows, but there are no fixed numbers; only when decline occurs does it cease. If recovery occurs and then victory does not return, it is harmful. This injures life.&quot;</p>
<p>This clarifies that where there is victory, recovery continues indefinitely, but it must await the decline of the victorious qi before it can stop.<a id="trans-364p" href="#orig-364p" class="marker">[364p]</a><br>The restoration of balance leads to victory; just as the fire element, having regained its strength, overcomes metal, metal then regains its strength and overcomes fire in turn. This cycle of overcoming and restoring is variable, without fixed patterns, only ceasing when the overpowering energy diminishes. Hence, when the restorative energy manifests, it can also gain the upper hand. If fire, re-establishing itself, overcomes metal, then metal must also regain its strength. If it fails to regain strength, metal will suffer harm from fire, thus injuring its vitality. Therefore, one must wait for the decline of power before balance is achieved; wherever there is overcoming, there is also restoration.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What is the illness of restoration and reversal?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;It is due to occupying an improper position, leading to disharmony. When restoration achieves dominance, then its master prevails, hence the reversal of illness, which is characterized by heat and dryness associated with fire.&quot;</p>
<p>The reversal of restoration refers specifically to the illness stemming from the restorative energy. For example, when fire regains strength and dominates the metal position, the metal energy likewise regains its strength and dominates fire&#39;s position; both are out of place and thus fail to harmonize. Therefore, when restoration achieves dominance, its master prevails, resulting in the reversal of illness. When fire&#39;s energy strongly dominates in Yangming, the main energies of the five positions overpower it; similarly, when metal&#39;s energy strongly dominates in Shaoyin, the main energies of the two positions overpower it. This illustrates the illness of the restorative energy, characterized by the heat and dryness of fire.<a id="trans-365p" href="#orig-365p" class="marker">[365p]</a><br>The remaining Qi behaves in this manner. When the victorious Qi returns, it revives; when the victorious Qi wanes, it ceases. The Qi of victory and revival is suitable for gradual decline, but not for a great resurgence. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How should it be governed?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the Qi is victorious, the subtle ones follow it, and the extreme ones are restrained. When the Qi revives, the harmonious ones are balanced, and the violent ones are subdued. All conform to the victorious Qi, ensuring their submission. Without concern for their numbers, the goal is to achieve balance. This is the way.&quot;</p>
<p>The commentary states: &quot;The subtle ones follow it, adapting to its Qi for adjustment. The extreme ones are restrained, controlled by what they fear. The harmonious ones are balanced, moderating the subtle. The wayward and violent are subdued, their strength diminished. But by merely following the victorious Qi, the Qi of submission will be naturally at peace. There is no need to inquire about the fluctuations of victory and revival; only establishing balance in Qi is the goal. This is the method of governing victory and revival.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said, &quot;Good. How about the victory and revival of host and guest?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The Qi of the host is victorious and without revival.&quot;</p>
<p>The commentary adds: &quot;This discusses the victory and revival of the main Qi and the guest Qi across the four seasons.&quot; </p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What of the contraries?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the host is victorious, it is contrary; when the guest is victorious, it is in accordance with the way of heaven.&quot;<a id="trans-366p" href="#orig-366p" class="marker">[366p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The guest qi refers to the energies governed by the heavens, located between the springs and their surroundings, one of the six energies of heaven. Heaven encompasses the earth, and from beneath the springs, the six energies circulate, reflecting the way of heaven. The main qi pertains to the positioning of the five directions and four seasons, embodying the way of the earth. Kun (the earth) follows heaven, thus the main qi overcomes the guest qi in opposition, while the guest qi follows in compliance, aligning with the way of heaven.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What are the symptoms of life-threatening illnesses?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the Jueyin (Liver) governs the heavens, if the guest qi prevails, there will be ringing in the ears and dizziness, and in severe cases, coughing; if the main qi prevails, there will be pain in the chest and flanks, and difficulty in speaking.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the guest qi of wind and wood prevails from above, it causes ringing in the ears and dizziness. The Jueyin liver is linked to the lungs through the diaphragm. In severe cases, coughing indicates the excess qi entering the meridians. When the main qi prevails, it results in pain in the chest and flanks, as the liver meridian spreads through these areas. The Jueyin and Shaoyang govern tendons; when the two meridians are afflicted, the tongue curls, leading to difficulty in speaking. Guest qi descends from above, while main qi ascends from within.</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin (Heart) governs the heavens, if the guest qi prevails, there will be sneezing, stiff neck, heat in the shoulders and back, headaches, shortness of breath with fever, deafness and closed eyes, and in severe cases, swelling, blood leakage, sores, and cough-induced wheezing; if the main qi prevails, there will be heart heat and irritability, and in severe cases, pain and fullness in the flanks.<a id="trans-367p" href="#orig-367p" class="marker">[367p]</a><br><strong>Notes</strong>:<br>In the Lesser Yin phase of heaven, the initial energy is the cold water of the Greater Yang, the second energy is the wind and wood of the Jue Yin, and the third energy is the fire of the Lesser Yin. Symptoms such as sneezing, deafness, and closed eyes indicate an excess of Jue Yin energy. Symptoms like stiff neck, shoulder and back heat, and headaches, especially severe cases leading to swelling, indicate an excess of the cold water energy of the Greater Yang. Mild energy surges with fever, blood overflow in sores or coughing and wheezing indicate an excess of the fire energy of the monarch. The initial controlling energy is the wind and wood of Jue Yin, the second energy is the monarch fire, and the third energy is the mutual fire. When the controlling energy prevails, it results in heart heat and restlessness, indicating the dominance of both monarch and mutual fire energies. In severe cases, pain in the ribs and fullness indicates an excess of Jue Yin&#39;s initial energy. This is attributed to the monarch fire governing the year, hence the supremacy of fire, which can lead to Jue Yin symptoms. </p>
<p>In the Greater Yin phase of heaven, when the external energy prevails, symptoms include swelling in the head and face, along with respiratory distress. When the internal energy prevails, it results in fullness in the chest and abdomen, leading to restlessness post meals. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:<br>When the external energy prevails, swelling in the head and face indicates dampness affecting the upper body. Respiratory distress indicates dampness affecting the internal organs. When the internal energy prevails, fullness in the chest and abdomen indicates that the initial energy of wood overwhelms and injures the earth element. According to the classics, the lungs are affected by severe external illnesses, leading to a condition where both hands are crossed, signaling the interrelation of the second and third energies’ fire, resulting in lung diseases.<a id="trans-368p" href="#orig-368p" class="marker">[368p]</a><br><strong>When the Lesser Yang governs the heavens, if the external influence of guests prevails, it leads to the emergence of rash-like conditions, resulting in red eruptions from within. This includes symptoms such as vomiting, throat obstruction, headaches, throat swelling, deafness, blood discharge, and internal disturbances. When these conditions prevail, symptoms manifest as chest fullness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and in severe cases, there may be blood and hot hands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: The Lesser Yang governs the heavens, and its initial energy involves the interaction of two types of fire. The dual energies correspond to the dampness of the Greater Yin. &quot;Dan Zhen&quot; refers to rashes that appear externally due to heat. &quot;Dan Chao&quot; signifies eruptions that emerge outwardly but wish to penetrate inwardly. Vomiting and internal disturbances arise from the convergence of damp and earthy energies. Symptoms such as sores and throat swelling develop due to damp-heat; these conditions originate from above and descend from the outside to the inside. The lungs, which cover the heart, exhibit symptoms related to chest fullness and cough, wherein the dual fires of vital energy rise and seek external release. Difficulty in breathing indicates lung illness preventing rest. Severe symptoms include blood and hot hands, indicating fire emerging externally. The channels of the two governing energies traverse through the hands, hence the observation of warm hands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the Greater Yang governs the heavens, if the internal remnants of clarity are restored, it leads to persistent cough and nosebleeds with throat blockage and heat in the heart. If the cough does not cease and white blood emerges, it indicates death.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: Restoring the internal remnants of clarity means that the clear and serene guest energy enters within but remains excessive. Coughing, nosebleeds, and throat blockage indicate lung disease and heat within the heart cavity.</strong><a id="trans-369p" href="#orig-369p" class="marker">[369p]</a><br>The lung is associated with metal and governs the sky. Therefore, the yangming controls the qi of the sky, which remains within, resulting in disease in the lung. When blood comes out, it is from the lung, as yangming oversees the sky, which is its qi. The organs are associated with yin, and blood is yin. When blood flows from the lung, it indicates excessive yang and a depletion of yin.</p>
<p>When the taiyang is governing the sky, if the guest is victorious, there will be discomfort in the chest, leading to clear nasal discharge and cough when subjected to cold; if the host is victorious, there will be a sound in the throat. </p>
<p>(Note: The taiyang qi is on the surface, while the lung governs the skin and hair. Hence, when it receives the guest qi of the sky, there will be discomfort in the chest, resulting in clear nasal discharge and cough. The statement regarding coughing due to cold indicates the distinction between taiyang and cold water. The host being victorious results in sound in the throat, which arises from the cold water’s qi below coming forth from the lung.)</p>
<p>In the jueyin, when the guest is victorious, the major joints will be uncomfortable, leading to internal spasms and rigidity, and externally causing inconvenience; when the host is victorious, the muscles and bones will be tense, with occasional pain in the waist and abdomen.</p>
<p>(Note: The major joints refer to the twelve joints of the hands and feet. The jueyin is associated with the springs; the guest qi obtained from the yangming causes dryness due to metal, which leads to the tension in the joints.)<a id="trans-370p" href="#orig-370p" class="marker">[370p]</a><br>Next, the guest Qi is that of the cold water of the sun. The sun governs the vital energy of all Yang; the Yang energy, when gentle, nourishes the tendons. If the cold energy lingers within, the sun experiences it, leading to internal conditions of spasm and rigidity, known as the stubbornness of sinew and muscle. The guest Qi at the end pertains to the wind and wood of the spring, thus the external manifestation is one of inconvenience. Inconvenience also implies a disadvantage to the sinews and bones. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: &quot;The bones are loose, the joints are slack and do not gather.&quot; What is referred to as bone looseness is actually excessive movement.</p>
<p>In the vital energy of spring, the Taiyin governs the moist earth, the Yangming governs the dry metal, and the sun governs the cold water. If the sinews and bones become loose alongside waist and abdominal pain, this indicates illness arising from the interaction of the three energies.</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin Qi rules at the spring, a guest victory leads to waist pain, affecting the buttocks, knees, spleen, and legs, accompanied by dizziness, heat, and sourness, with swelling that prevents prolonged standing, affecting urination and bowel movements. When the host prevails, the Qi of counterflow ascends, causing heart pain and heat, with multiple obstructions in the diaphragm manifesting in the ribs, with the spirit&#39;s sweat unable to be retained, leading to four reversals.</p>
<p>The guest Qi of the four is that of the cold water of the sun, hence the waist, buttocks, thighs, and legs are affected; this is a manifestation of the sun channel&#39;s condition in relation to similar energies. The next guest Qi is that of the Jueyin wind and wood, leading to dizziness, heat, sourness, and swelling impeding standing, indicating the condition of the spleen’s earth, as wood excess causes the earth to suffer. The final guest Qi is that of the Shaoyin fire, with the governing Qi being the cold water of the sun.<a id="trans-371p" href="#orig-371p" class="marker">[371p]</a><br>The transformation of urine and stool is caused by the interplay of water and fire, with fire manifesting below. When the primary force is strong, the qi rises; when there is heart pain and heat, it is due to the governing qi of cold water rising above, overpowering the monarch fire at the spring. The primary force of the fifth is the dry metal of Yangming, while the guest qi is the wind wood of Jueyin. Various obstructions exist in their respective places, some worsen and then cease, some reside and then rise, with right responding to left and left to right. Various obstructions in the diaphragm arise from the sides, as the qi of Yangming conquers the meridian of Jueyin. The primary force of the fourth is the damp earth of Taiyin, while the guest qi is the cold water of Taiyang. The po sweat is the exterior sweat. Sweat is the yin fluid. The bladder is where fluids are stored. If there is reverse movement, it is the earth qi rising. By earth overcoming water, fluids are not stored, and sweat emerges on the surface.</p>
<p>When Taiyin prevails at the spring, if the guest qi is strong, there will be weakness in the legs and heaviness below, with urination and defecation occurring at odd times. The dampness of the guest affects the lower focus, causing moist diarrhea and contributing to diseases like edema and hidden curvature. If the primary force is strong, there will be a reversal of cold qi, a fullness that restricts food and drink intake, potentially leading to hernias.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Weakness in the legs and heaviness below, urination and defecation at odd times&quot; refers to dampness at the spring affecting the meridian of Taiyin, reaching inward.)<a id="trans-372p" href="#orig-372p" class="marker">[372p]</a><br>When the dampness in the lower abdomen manifests as fluid discharge or swelling, it is due to indulgence in sexual activities below, causing illness to the governing qi of the Taiyin. &quot;Yinqu&quot; refers to the areas of the genitals between men and women. The governing qi of the end is the cold water of the Yangming, while the guest qi is the damp earth of the Tian (Heaven); therefore, when the governing qi is strong, the cold qi reverses upward. This occurs because the water overabundance ascends and overpowers the earth, leading to a reversal.</p>
<p>The governing qi of the Four Directions is the damp earth of the Taiyin, while the guest qi represents the wind wood of the Jueyin. When food and drink are not taken, it may lead to hernias when the damp qi rises upward and affects the channels of the Jueyin. The governing qi of the Five Elements is the autumn metal of the Yangming, while the guest qi is the fire of the Shaoyin. Fire can control metal, which is why it does not ascend and dominate.</p>
<p>When the Shaoyang is in the spring, if the guest strong is present, it causes pain in the waist and abdomen with adverse cold symptoms, and in severe cases, it results in white urine; conversely, if the governing qi is strong, heat ascends and affects the heart, causing heart pain and fever with nausea. The situation of the Shaoyin is similar.</p>
<p>(Note: The notes clarify that when the Shaoyang is in the spring, the initial guest qi is the fire of the Shaoyin, with the governing qi as the damp earth of the Taiyin. Subsequently, the guest qi becomes the damp earth of the Taiyin, with the governing qi as the dry metal of the Yangming. Finally, the guest qi becomes the fire of the Shaoyang, while the governing qi is the cold water of the Taiyang. Pain in the waist and abdomen with adverse cold indicates that the guest is strong and the governing qi of the Taiyang is ill. The injury to the qi of the Taiyang causes the adverse cold.)<a id="trans-373p" href="#orig-373p" class="marker">[373p]</a><br>In severe cases, the presence of white in urine indicates an issue with the Yangming and Taiyin vital energies. The vital energy of Metal, when transformed, results in urination. White urine signifies that the energy is not transforming properly, causing unclear urine. The presence of white stools indicates that the Earth energy is damaged, resulting in pale feces. When the guest energy overcomes the host energy, it causes the latter to rebel, hence the term &quot;rebel.&quot; When the host energy prevails, the heat reverses and ascends, affecting the heart. Heart pain accompanied by fever indicates that the guest energy of the two types of fire also ascends and causes disease. If one experiences nausea and vomiting, it signals that the guest energy of the Taiyin is ill. When the host prevails and the guest energy rebels, this is referred to as &quot;rebel&quot; or &quot;guest,&quot; and the lesser Yin corresponds. The nature of fire is to rise, which is why both types of fire can cause a rebellious state leading to disease.</p>
<p>When Yangming is in the source, if the guest energy prevails, the clear energy moves downward, leading to a hard and full lower abdomen with frequent diarrhea. If the host energy prevails, there is a sensation of heaviness in the waist and abdominal pain, and the lower abdomen feels cold. If this leads to watery diarrhea, there is a cold sensation in the intestines that ascends to the chest, and in severe cases, it results in difficulty breathing and an inability to stand for long periods.</p>
<p>Notes: The movement of clear energy downward signifies the impact of the crisp and cool Qi in the lower region. Hard and full lower abdomen with frequent diarrhea indicates an illness related to the cold water of the Sun. Host energy prevailing results in a heavy waist and abdominal pain, and the cold sensation in the lower abdomen arises from the cold water energy of the Sun manifesting downward.<a id="trans-374p" href="#orig-374p" class="marker">[374p]</a><br>The lower part is where the water leaks. Cold stagnation in the intestines can surge upwards into the chest, leading to severe cases of shortness of breath. The cold energy reverses and invades the Yangming large intestine, rising up to the lungs in the chest. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: when the energy surges upward to the chest, it causes breathlessness that cannot be sustained, indicating that the evil is in the large intestine, which is connected to the lungs and stomach, and governs the metal energy.</p>
<p>When the solar energy is at the spring and the cold lingers internally, it results in pain in the lower back and buttocks, making bending and stretching difficult, with pain in the thighs, shins, feet, and knees. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qibo replied: For what is high, suppress it; for what is low, raise it; for excess, reduce it; and for deficiency, supplement it. Support it with what is beneficial and harmonize it with what is appropriate. Ensure the balance between the host and the guest, adapting to hot and cold. Counteract the similar and follow the different.</p>
<p>To suppress the high refers to reversing the energy that is in excess above. Raising the low refers to the invading energy below. Excess indicates stronger energy. Deficiency refers to the energy that is insufficient, leading to illness. Supporting what is beneficial means enhancing what is desired.<a id="trans-375p" href="#orig-375p" class="marker">[375p]</a><br>If the liver desires to spread, urgently consume pungent foods to disperse it; thus, the victory of Jueyin is assisted by bitter and pungent. If the heart desires to soften, urgently consume salty foods to soften it; hence, the victory of Shaoyin is assisted by bitter and salty. If the spleen desires to relax, urgently consume sweet foods to relax it; thus, the victory of Taiyin is assisted by sweet and pungent. If the lungs desire to contract, urgently consume sour foods to contract them; therefore, the victory of dryness is assisted by pungent and sour. If the kidneys desire to strengthen, urgently consume bitter foods to strengthen them; thus, the victory of cold is assisted by sweet and bitter. </p>
<p>Understanding the suitable harmonization is to align with the appropriate five tastes. For example, Jueyin is associated with the color green and is best complemented by sweet foods; Shaoyin and Shaoyang are associated with red and are best complemented by sour foods; Taiyin is associated with yellow and is best complemented by salty foods; Yangming is associated with white and is best complemented by bitter foods; and Taiyang is associated with black and is best complemented by pungent foods. </p>
<p>Stabilizing the roles of host and guest allows each to maintain its proper position. Adjusting for cold and warmth means treating cold with heat, treating heat with cold, treating warmth with coolness, and treating coolness with warmth. When conditions are similar, they should be treated in an opposing manner, meaning that energies that are compatible should be treated contrary to their nature. For instance, when both host and guest share a fiery heat, they should be treated with salty and cold; likewise, when sharing cold water, they should be treated with pungent and hot. The same applies to warm and cool. This is the method of opposing treatment. When conditions differ, they should be treated accordingly, meaning that those incompatible should be treated in alignment with their condition.<a id="trans-376p" href="#orig-376p" class="marker">[376p]</a><br>Like the cold water managing the heavens, like being positioned above the two fiery spirits, the guest must overcome the cold with the heat of the two fires, and the host must overcome the heat with the coldness that manages the heavens. The same applies to all other qi. This is the principle of balancing opposites.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: To treat cold with heat and heat with cold. When energies are compatible, one should counteract them; when they are not compatible, one should follow their lead. I already understand this. But what about the proper flavors?</p>
<p>Qibo replied: The host of the wood position drains with sourness and supplements with spiciness.</p>
<p>This refers to the wood position governed by the jueyin. This is an unchanging position of the four seasons. If the season has not yet reached its peak, but the energy of early spring arrives first, this abundant energy should be drained with sourness. If it has arrived but is not yet at its peak, this waning energy should be supplemented with spiciness. The nature of wood is to rise; sourness counteracts its nature and constrains it, hence it is draining. Spiciness supports and promotes its rising energy, thus it is supplementary.</p>
<p>The host of the fire position drains with sweetness and supplements with saltiness.<a id="trans-377p" href="#orig-377p" class="marker">[377p]</a><br>The &quot;two energies&quot; refer to the fire governed by the ruler, while the &quot;three energies&quot; pertain to the fire governed by the minister. If warm and hot energies arrive before the third month or before the fifth month, it indicates an excess of incoming energy and should be alleviated with sweetness, as it drains the maternal energy from the child. If energy arrives and yet does not fully manifest, this suggests a deficiency, thus it should be replenished with salinity, as water supports fire.</p>
<p>The earthly authority should be alleviated with bitterness and replenished with sweetness.</p>
<p>The earth governs the four energies; during the time of the governing energy, dust rises and rain falls, indicating an abundance of energy, which should be alleviated with bitterness to drain the stagnation. If the transformative energy is not regulated, wind and cold arise simultaneously, indicating a deficiency of the governing energy. In such cases, it should be supplemented with sweetness, as those lacking energy are nourished by flavor.</p>
<p>The metal authority should be alleviated with pungency and replenished with sourness.<a id="trans-378p" href="#orig-378p" class="marker">[378p]</a><br>The five phases of qi: when a refreshing air arrives late, this is an indication of the intensity of the qi. For relief, it is appropriate to use pungent flavors, as they disperse it. If the heat persists well into autumn, this indicates an insufficiency of qi. In this case, sour flavors should be used for nourishment, as they help to contain it.</p>
<p>The master of water corresponds to salty flavors for relief and bitter flavors for nourishment.</p>
<p>The terminal phase of qi: when the weather is bitterly cold with ice, snow, and hail, this signifies a heightened state of qi. Salty flavors should be used for relief because they can help to drain it, aligning with its nature. If the weather remains warm despite this phase, it indicates an insufficiency of qi. Therefore, it is beneficial to nourish with bitter flavors since bitterness is cold and helps elevate the dampness associated with heat, supporting the foundational essence of yang. This is referred to as balancing with the proper flavors to achieve harmony, preventing seasonal imbalances from becoming ailments for the populace.</p>
<p>In the case of the guest of jueyin, one should nourish with pungent flavors, relieve with sour flavors, and moderate with sweet flavors.</p>
<p>This also applies to the six phases influenced by external factors, where there are appropriate flavors for both excess and deficiency. The six phases operate without fixed locations, resembling guests arriving from outside, hence the term &quot;guest.&quot; It is customary to observe this during the early dawn of the first day of the lunar month. If qi arrives insufficiently, pungent flavors should be used for nourishment; if qi is overly abundant, sour flavors should be used for relief, moderated by sweet flavors. According to the doctrine concerning the internal organs: when the liver is imbalanced and bitter, consuming sweet flavors can help alleviate it. Hence, when qi is abundant, it flows outward; if excess guest qi exists, it remains within, necessitating the combination of flavors desired by the five internal organs to bring balance.</p>
<p>For the guest of shaoyin, one should nourish with salty flavors, relieve with sweet flavors, and contain with salty flavors.<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a><br>The theory of organ Qi states: When the heart is weak, quickly consume sour foods to remedy it. In discussing the principle of Qi, draining is mentioned first before supplementing, while in discussing the guest Qi, supplementing is mentioned first before draining. There is a path for supplementing and draining: some cases require supplementation without draining, others require draining without supplementation, some should be supplemented first then drained, some should be drained first then supplemented, and others require a combination of both.</p>
<p>For the guest of great yin, use sweet to supplement, bitter to drain, and sweet to relax. The theory of organ Qi states: When the spleen desires relaxation, quickly consume sweet foods to achieve this. </p>
<p>For the guest of lesser yang, use salty to supplement, sweet to drain, and salty to soften. The theory of organ Qi states: When the heart desires to soften, quickly consume salty foods to achieve this. Lesser yang is the envelope of the heart.</p>
<p>For the guest of yangming, use sour to supplement, pungent to drain, and bitter to discharge. The theory of organ Qi states: When the lung is suffering from upward counterflow of Qi, quickly consume pungent foods to drain it.</p>
<p>For the guest of taiyang, use bitter to supplement, salty to drain, bitter to strengthen, and pungent to moisten, thereby opening the pores and promoting the circulation of fluids and Qi.<a id="trans-380p" href="#orig-380p" class="marker">[380p]</a><br><strong>Note: The method of dealing with internal sickness states: The kidney desires firmness, urgently eat bitter foods to strengthen it. The kidney is dry and lacking, urgently eat pungent foods to moisten it. Open the pores to allow fluids to circulate. The pores are where the three burners connect with the true essence. The channels refer to the patterns of skin and internal organs. When food and water enter, fluids follow their respective paths, thus the three burners emit qi to warm the muscles and nourish the skin, forming its fluids. When qi fills the muscles and pores, fluids follow the movement of qi. The pungent flavor enters the stomach, can open the pores, cause fluids to flow, and circulate qi, hence it is the primary moistening agent.</strong></p>
<p>The emperor said: Good. I wish to hear what the three aspects of yin and yang are. Qi Bo replied: Qi has varying amounts and different uses.</p>
<p><strong>Note: This indicates that with the extremes of yin and yang, qi has ups and downs, affecting treatments in terms of lightness and heaviness. Within yin and yang, there are greater yang and lesser yang, as well as greater yin and lesser yin, thus qi has varying amounts and different uses.</strong></p>
<p>The emperor asked: What is meant by yangming? Qi Bo replied: The two yangs combine to become bright.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The discussion about yin and yang states that the tiger signifies the birth of yang in the first month, governing the lesser yang of the left foot. The rabbit signifies the second month, governing the greater yang of the left foot. The horse signifies the fifth month, governing the greater yang of the right foot. The goat signifies the sixth month, governing the lesser yang of the right foot.</strong><a id="trans-381p" href="#orig-381p" class="marker">[381p]</a><br>In the third month, it is the sign of the Yangming of the left foot. In the fourth month, it is the sign of the Yangming of the right foot. These two Yang enhance each other in the front, thus it is said that Yangming is abundant in Qi but lacks blood. The Emperor asked, &quot;What is Jueyin?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;It is the intersection of the two Yin.&quot;</p>
<p>Notes: In the seventh month, the Yin is born, representing the Shaoyin of the right foot. In the twelfth month, it represents the Shaoyin of the left foot. In the eighth month, it represents the Taiyin of the right foot. In the eleventh month, it represents the Taiyin of the left foot. In the ninth month, it represents the Jueyin of the right foot. In the tenth month, it represents the Jueyin of the left foot. Since these two Yin intersect completely, it is called Jueyin. Jueyin governs when Yin is exhausted and a single Yang begins to emerge, being the subtle aspect of Qi, hence it is considered as the Shaoyang among Yin and having lesser Qi.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;Qi has abundance and scarcity, diseases have severity and mildness, treatments have urgency and delay, and prescriptions have strengths and weaknesses. I wish to hear how they are measured.&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;Qi has heights and depths, diseases have distances, symptoms have internal and external aspects, and treatments have lightness and heaviness, all depending on the appropriate action taken.&quot; </p>
<p>Notes: The heights and depths of Qi refer to the nine phases of heaven, earth, and humanity. Distances refer to the shallow, deep, up, and down. Internal and external refer to the surface and the interior. Lightness and heaviness refer to the size of the treatment given.<a id="trans-382p" href="#orig-382p" class="marker">[382p]</a><br>The root cause lies in addressing the location of the illness. The main principle states: one ruler and two subjects constitute an odd system; two rulers and four subjects form an even system; two rulers and three subjects create an odd system; two rulers and six subjects define an even system.</p>
<p>In notes, the main principle refers to the essence of numbers. Numbers begin with one and achieve completeness with three, representing the circle. By pairing two, they form six, symbolizing the square. Earth is represented by the number two, and wood by three; when甲 (jia) and己 (ji) combine, soil is transformed. Two rulers and six subjects align with the positions of heaven and earth, forming the eight trigrams. When it is less than two, it begins with the yin number; when it is more than nine, it concludes with the yang number.</p>
<p>Thus, it is said: treat those close with odd methods, and those far with even methods. Addressing sweating does not use odd methods, and treating the lower does not employ even methods. To treat those above with a calming approach, and those below with urgency, is the way to proceed. Urgency leads to denser energy, while calmness results in lighter energy. Properly addressing the specific location of the ailment is the key here. </p>
<p>Notes: Odd and even refer to the numbers of heaven and earth. &quot;Close&quot; means the illness is at the top and near, hence odd methods are used to treat it, as weather exists above. &quot;Far&quot; indicates the illness is below and distant, so even methods are employed, reflecting the earth&#39;s energy below.<a id="trans-383p" href="#orig-383p" class="marker">[383p]</a><br>Sweat is the yin fluid, thus it is used in pairs rather than in singles; this is because it rises directly from below to allow it to ascend, similar to how the earth&#39;s qi rises before forming clouds and rain. When there is a need to descend, the single is used rather than the pair, as this comes from above to descend in response to the downward movement of heavenly qi. </p>
<p>The補 (bu) refers to replenishing the deficiency of vital qi, while 治 (zhi) refers to addressing the excess of pathogenic qi. Those above should be treated with slow methods, while those below require urgent approaches. For urgent cases, use heavier flavors, while for slower cases, use lighter flavors, as the heavy flavors are dense and easily descend, while lighter flavors are light and clear, allowing them to rise. The pair and single, slow and urgent, should be adapted to their respective positions above or below, down to the specific location of the illness.</p>
<p>For illnesses that are distant, measured flavors should be consumed in moderation without exceeding their prescribed limits. Therefore, the method of balancing qi is near and with pairs and singles, which requires smaller quantities of food. For distant cases, it is near and uses larger quantities of food. Larger quantities imply fewer items, while smaller quantities imply more items. More items total nine, while fewer items total two.</p>
<p>(Note: This explains the movement of flavors from the center to the top and bottom. When the illness is distant, it refers to an illness located above or below but distant from the central stomach. The measured flavors from the center signify that flavors move accordingly up and down, thus they should be used in conjunction with both medicine and food in prescribed amounts.)<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a><br>If the illness is located above and distant from the center, one should first consume food and then take medicine. If the illness is below and distant from the center, one should first take medicine and then eat. This is based on the principle of the sequence of food and medicine, ensuring that the flavors of the medicine do not interfere with food in terms of their positioning. Therefore, when the illnesses are located above or below and are close to the central pathway, using unique and general methods requires smaller dosages. When the illness is far from the center and involves unique and general treatments, it is appropriate to use larger dosages. The terms &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; in dosages refer to their relative lightness and heaviness. Larger doses should be given in fewer numbers with more extensive applications, as they are potent and effective over greater distances. Smaller doses should be given in larger numbers with more limited applications, as their potency is diluted and cannot reach far. This reflects the pathway of the three energies: upper, middle, and lower. </p>
<p>When the unique does not dissipate, then it is accompanied by the general, which is called a heavier prescription. When the general does not dissipate, it is countered and supplemented to be effective. The concepts of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness should align with the nature of the illness viewed in the context of the seasons. The emperor said: &quot;Good. I understand that an illness arises from its origin.” he continued, &quot;But what about illnesses that arise from superficial causes?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Illness reflects its origin and results in symptoms that are superficial.&quot;<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a><br>To treat the root, one must address the symptoms. </p>
<p>(Note: This discussion pertains to the relationship between the three yin and three yang, distinguishing between the root and the symptoms. Illness arising from the root comes from wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, or fire. Illness arising from the symptoms comes from the qi of the three yin and three yang. For example, the sun is the chief of all yang, rooted in cold water; the lesser yin is the greatest of the yin in the midst of yin and is rooted in the fire of the lord; yangming represents the flourishing qi of yang, rooted in clarity and coolness; and jueyin governs extreme yin, which is rooted in the yang of wind and wood. Within the categories of yin and yang, there exists a distinction between root and symptom. When illness reflects the root, for instance, a cold condition might ironically lead to the warmth of the sun; a hot condition might reflect the coolness of the lesser yin; a yang condition could reveal a deficiency in clarity and coolness; and a yin condition could unexpectedly manifest in fire and heat. This notion of illness reflecting the root deals with symptoms arising from that illness. Treating in opposition to the root means that if the actual condition is cold yet manifests warmth, one should counteract heat with cooling medicines; conversely, if the root condition is hot yet shows coldness, one should apply warming medicines to address cold; if the condition lies in yangming and presents with virtual cold, then one should invigorate the inner qi; if the condition is in jueyin and exhibits fire and heat, treatment must reverse to address the lesser yang. Therefore, treatment that opposes the root follows the symptom. Both lesser yang and lesser yin are similar in terms of root and symptom, both deriving treatment from yang heat and yin dampness.) </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good. How do we assess the triumph of the six qi?<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a><br>[Note: This discussion concerns the energies of the four seasons and five elements, which correspond to the five organs internally and the six meridians externally.] Qibo said: When the pure qi arrives abundantly, dryness prevails, and when the wind and wood are affected by evil influences, diseases of the liver arise. When hot qi arrives abundantly, fire prevails, and when metal and dryness are affected by evil influences, diseases of the lung arise. When cold qi arrives abundantly, water prevails, and when fire and heat are affected by evil influences, diseases of the heart arise. When damp qi arrives abundantly, earth prevails, and when cold water is affected by evil influences, diseases of the kidney arise. When wind qi arrives abundantly, wood prevails, and when earth and dampness are affected by evil influences, diseases of the spleen arise. This is what is meant by being affected by evil influences and resulting in illness. [Note: Wind, cold, heat, dampness, and dryness are the five energies of the four seasons in the heavens; wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the five elements in the four seasons of the earth. The predominance of five energies affects the five elements, and through the five elements leads to diseases of the five organs, reflecting the external connection of the five organs with the five elements, and the manifestation of the five energies above the five elements.] When the yearly cycle is void, the evil influences are severe. When the harmony of the seasons is lost, the evil influences are also severe.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a><br>In the presence of the empty moon, there is also great evil. When heavily affected by malevolent influences, illness becomes critical. If there is a victorious energy, it is certain to return. </p>
<p>The emptiness of the year indicates that the annual energies are insufficient. For example, if the wood element is inadequate, the pure energy prevails; if the fire element is insufficient, the cold energy prevails; if the earth element is lacking, the wind energy prevails; if the metal element is insufficient, the heat energy prevails; if the water element is lacking, the moist energy prevails. When the annual energies are lacking, and the prevailing energies of the seasons are also burdened, then the harmony of the right timing is lost, resulting in a decline of seasonal energies. If the energy of spring is insufficient, then the autumn energy prevails; if summer energy is lacking, winter energy prevails; if the extended summer lacks energy, then spring energies prevail, and if autumn energy is insufficient, summer energy prevails; if winter energy is lacking, the extended summer energy prevails.</p>
<p>The empty moon signifies a time of emptiness. Being heavily influenced by malevolent forces due to the emptiness of the year, the loss of seasonal harmony, and the occurrence of the empty moon, is called the three emptinesses. Thus, being influenced by evil brings about critical illness.<a id="trans-388p" href="#orig-388p" class="marker">[388p]</a><br>When there is a prevailing force, it will surely return. In spring, when there is the victory of sorrowful and lingering devastation, summer will have the return of scorching heat. Similarly, when summer experiences the victory of sorrowful and chilling cold, the four directions will respond with dark clouds and heavy rain. When the four directions experience the upheaval and swirling changes, autumn will then have the return of chill and relentless rain; autumn’s change from burning heat will lead to winter&#39;s return of hail, frost, and snow. When winter experiences dark and sudden downpours, spring will then have the return of drift and upheaval. These are the victories of the four seasons, and there will always be a corresponding return.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What is the pulse like when these conditions manifest? Qi Bo replied: The pulse of Jueyin is string-like; the pulse of Shaoyin is hook-like; the pulse of Taiyin is deep; the pulse of Shaoyang is large and floating; the pulse of Yangming is short and wiry; the pulse of Taiyang is large and long.</p>
<p>[Note: This discusses how the six climatic influences correspond to the six pulses. Jueyin governs wood, thus its pulse is string-like. Shaoyin governs fire, hence its pulse is hook-like. Taiyin governs earth, resulting in a deep pulse. Shaoyang also governs fire, producing a large and floating pulse. Yangming governs metal, leading to a short and wiry pulse. Taiyang governs water and represents the master energy of yang, hence it is large and long.]</p>
<p>When these conditions arrive harmoniously, they bring balance; when they become excessive, they lead to illness. If they arrive and then reverse, that indicates illness; if they arrive but do not fully manifest, that, too, indicates illness; if they have not yet arrived but are anticipated to arrive, that is also a sign of illness. The interchange of yin and yang is perilous.</p>
<p>[Note: This indicates how the string-like, hook-like, and long or short pulses should correspond with the six climatic influences.]<a id="trans-389p" href="#orig-389p" class="marker">[389p]</a><br>If the pulse arrives harmoniously, it is that of a healthy person; if it is excessive, it indicates a pathological pulse. The pulse that arrives contrary to the time indicates illness, while the pulse that does not arrive in due time is also a sign of illness. If the pulse arrives prematurely before the time, it is also a symptom of illness. When the three Yin correspond to the time yet detect the Yang pulse, or when the three Yang correspond to the time yet detect the Yin pulse, it is a sign of danger. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;The six atmospheric influences (qi) differ in their sources and manifestations; how then do they relate?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There are those that arise from the fundamental source, those that arise from manifest signs and sources, and those that do not arise from manifest sources.&quot; The Emperor requested to hear more. Qi Bo explained: &quot;The Shao Yang and Tai Yin arise from the fundamental source; the Shao Yin and Tai Yang arise both from the fundamental source and from signs; the Yang Ming and Jue Yin do not arise from the manifestations but from the center. Therefore, those that arise from the fundamental source are generated from the root; those from signs have transformations associated with those signs; and those that come from the center are transformed by the central qi.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The six atmospheric influences are wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire as the fundamental source, whereas the three Yin and three Yang are considered manifestations. Those with Yin dampness but observe the Tai Yin&#39;s Yin, and those with the initial Yang&#39;s fire yet observe the Shao Yang&#39;s Yang, represent the transformation from the fundamental source, thus Tai Yin and Shao Yang stem from the root. The Shao Yin&#39;s fundamental heat shows as the Shao Yin&#39;s Yin, the Tai Yang&#39;s fundamental cold shows as the Tai Yang&#39;s Yang; within Yin is Yang, and within Yang is Yin, thus existing are the transformations of water, fire, cold, and heat, hence the Shao Yin and Tai Yang stem from the fundamental source as well as from signs. Above the Yang Ming, the drying influences govern, revealing the Tai Yin; above the Jue Yin, the windy influences govern, revealing the Shao Yang.)<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a><br>The Yang Ming governs the autumn of the four seasons, while the Tai Yin presides over the clear autumn of the four qi. The Jue Yin corresponds to the intersection of two yin, where yin is exhausted and one yang begins to emerge; thus, Yang Ming and Jue Yin manifest transformations from within. The Emperor asked: If the pulse indicates a reverse condition, what is the diagnosis? Qi Bo replied: When the pulse is present, following it, and pressing does not produce a response, this is true for all yang diseases. The Emperor continued: How is the pulse for all yin reversals? Qi Bo said: When the pulse is present, following it, pressing causes a strong response and is vigorous. </p>
<p>(Note: This discusses pulse diagnosis, which has both superficial and underlying aspects. When the pulse follows, it indicates a yang condition with a yang pulse or a yin condition with a yin pulse. For example, in the case of Tai Yang or Yang Ming illness, if the pulse is present and floating, that is a sign of a superficial condition. If the illness reverses into yin cold, the Tai Yang condition transforms from the surface, and the Yang Ming condition reveals a transformation into yin, hence though the pulse is floating, it does not respond strongly upon pressing. In cases of Shao Yin or Jue Yin illness, if the pulse is present and sinking, that indicates a deeper condition. If the illness reverses into yang heat, the Shao Yin condition transforms from the surface, and the Jue Yin condition reveals a transformation into fire, thus although the pulse is sinking, it responds strongly upon pressing. This highlights the transformation of yin and yang in the pulse and the distinction between the superficial and underlying aspects of illness.)<a id="trans-391p" href="#orig-391p" class="marker">[391p]</a><br>In cases of illness caused by the Taiyang (greater yang), symptoms include headache, fever, and unquenchable thirst; these are the root manifestations of Taiyang disease. If there are symptoms such as cramping in the hands and feet or deep pulse with sweating, these represent the superficial manifestations of Taiyang disease. For Shaoyin (lesser yin) illness, if the pulse is deep, one should warm it urgently with Sijunzi Decoction; this represents the superficial manifestation of Shaoyin disease. If, after two to three days of Shaoyin disease, one experiences dry mouth and throat, urgent purgation is needed, and Dachengqi Decoction should be used; this is the root manifestation of Shaoyin disease. In cases of Yangming (yang brightness) disease, there are fever and thirst along with dry and constipated stools; these symptoms are the outward signs of Yangming disease. If there is a cold and empty sensation in the stomach, food does not digest, there is a desire to vomit, and the pulse is slow with aversion to cold, this indicates Yangming disease influenced by internal dampness. In cases of Jueyin (reverting yin) disease, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, this reflects the inward manifestations of Jueyin disease. If there is diabetes with upward-rebounding qi impacting the heart, causing heat and pain in the heart, this indicates Jueyin influenced by the fire of Shaoyang. For Taiyin (greater yin), with its superficial manifestations being cold and its root being dampness, it should be treated with Sijunzi and similar remedies. Shaoyang, with its superficial manifestations being hot and its root being fire, should be dispersed with cool remedies. In treating cold damage and the diseases of the six channels, one must consider the superficial and deep aspects; in doing so, one is already halfway to understanding. </p>
<p>Therefore, the origins of all diseases can arise from the root, the superficial level, or from the middle qi. Some illnesses derive from the root, others from the superficial level, or from the middle qi; some are obtained from the superficial level, others from the root, or from the combination of both.<a id="trans-392p" href="#orig-392p" class="marker">[392p]</a><br>There are those who obtain through opposition and those who obtain through compliance. Opposition is correct, compliance is also correct; if one is compliant, it is opposition. Therefore, it is said: understanding the marker and the root, using them without danger. To clearly know the oppositional and the compliant, and to act correctly without question. This is what is meant. Those who do not understand this are not qualified to speak of diagnosis, but only to confuse the principles. Hence, the key point states: crude practitioners laugh as if it were knowledge. They say that heat has not yet ceased, and ailments of cold have begun anew. Similar conditions with different forms lead to confusion in diagnosis and principles. This is what is meant.</p>
<p>[Note: The emergence of all diseases ultimately stems from the transformation of the six atmospheric influences, such as the effects of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire causing illnesses that relate to the six atmospheric influences. The six atmospheric influences from heaven manifest as diseases in our bodies, and within our bodies, there are also transformations of the six influences. For instance, wind as an external yang pathogenic factor affects the skin, resulting in fever and sneezing; it affects the tendons and bones, causing pain, numbness, and cramps; it affects the intestines and stomach, resulting in diarrhea and fluid loss, or causing dryness and retention. If it penetrates internally, it may lead to sudden illness or vomiting, or result in cold limbs and internal cold, as it deals with the transformation of the energies of yin and yang. If one is affected by the yang heat of one&#39;s own body, it results in heat illness; if affected by the yin cold, it results in cold illness; impacted by moisture results in sputum and wheezing; affected by dry air leads to constipation.]<a id="trans-393p" href="#orig-393p" class="marker">[393p]</a><br>If one is struck in the viscera, one may collapse suddenly and not recognize others; if struck in the organs, one’s tongue will become difficult to speak and the mouth will drool saliva. Similarly, in the case of cold damage, it is the evil of the heavens; one may be affected by yin or by yang. There are those who are struck by yang and exhibit symptoms of cold, and those who are struck by yin and exhibit symptoms of heat. This reflects the intermingling of yin and yang within our bodies and the transformation of their energies at the fundamental level. If one is affected by the dampness within the body, it results in symptoms related to Qinglong or Wuling; if one is affected by dryness and heat, then prescriptions like Baitou and Chengqi should be applied. This merely reflects the external evil of heaven, while the inner dynamics with their varying transformations of yin and yang also come into play.</p>
<p>Moreover, during summer illnesses, if there are cold extremities, symptoms resembling those treated by ginger, cinnamon, ginseng, and licorice will arise, because the yang energy of summer has fully emerged outward while the inner energy is originally weak. When subjected to wind and heat from the heavens, it may transform into yin and cold, demonstrating the dynamic changes within our bodies, not a direct result of summer heat causing a cold illness. Thus, adept practitioners understand how fundamental and symptomatic diseases arise, recognizing the transformation of energies. By understanding these transformations, they can effectively apply treatment methods that address both symptoms and root causes. Hence, knowing how to distinguish between symptoms and root causes allows for effective treatment without peril, clearly discerning the nature of things, and proceeding correctly regardless of the situation. This is the principle: treat cold with heat and heat with cold.<a id="trans-394p" href="#orig-394p" class="marker">[394p]</a><br>Therefore it is said, reversing is the same as following. Those who follow treat heat with heat and cold with cold, hence it is said to follow; reversing is the opposite. Within the dynamics of yin and yang, cold and heat, there are also conditions where heat manifests as cold, such as in cases of deep heat presenting as deep cold. Similarly, there are conditions where cold manifests as heat, such as when one removes clothing to enter the water, signifying the solitary yang escaping from the body, needing urgent nourishment from the yin. Amateur practitioners, in their folly, believe they understand; they claim the heat has not yet subsided, while the cold illness resumes, mistaking similar manifestations as identical, thus confusing diagnoses and disrupting the patterns. This is what is meant.</p>
<p>The essence of understanding the relationship between the surface and the root is that it is fundamental yet extensive, small yet significant; knowing one can lead to the understanding of a hundred ailments. Speaking of the surface and the root, they should be approached with ease and without loss. Observing the root and the surface allows for the harmonization of qi. Clear knowledge leads to victory and renewal, serving as a model for all people. This is the complete way of heaven.</p>
<p>[Note: This emphasizes the application of the relationship between surface and root. The principle of their relationship may be succinct, but its application is profound; though it may seem minor, its significance is vast. Knowing the relationship between surface and root allows for the understanding of the harms of a hundred ailments.]<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a><br>The principles of treatment should be straightforward and cause no harm, observing both the root and branches, even if the six energies change, can still be balanced. To understand the interaction between root and branches is sufficient to set a standard for the people, for the six energies follow the way of heaven. The Emperor asked: How does the change between dominance and recovery manifest in early versus late stages? Qibo replied: The one that is dominant indicates that illness has reached a critical point, with distress already present while recovery is just beginning. The one that is recovering shows that dominance has ended and has risen, taking on a significant position. Dominance can vary in intensity, and recovery can vary in quantity. When dominance is harmonized it achieves balance, and when dominance is vacuous, it becomes void. This is the constancy of heaven. The Emperor asked: What occurs when the process of dominance and recovery is misaligned or delayed? Qibo replied: The generation and transformation of qi exhibit different patterns of flourishing and declining. The uses of heat and cold vary across the four seasons. Thus, the movement of yang begins with warmth and flourishes in summer; the movement of yin begins with clarity and flourishes in winter. Each of spring, summer, autumn, and winter has its distinct allocations. Hence, it is said: The warmth of spring prepares for the heat of summer; the anger of autumn prepares for the fury of winter. By carefully observing the four dimensions, all scouts return. The end can be seen, and the beginning can be known. This is what is meant. The Emperor asked: Are there specific differences? Qibo replied: In total, there are thirty degrees.</p>
<p>(Note: This text discusses the principles of treatment and the dynamics of seasonal changes and their effects on health.)<a id="trans-396p" href="#orig-396p" class="marker">[396p]</a><br>From the supportive to the righteous, and from the righteous to the supportive, cold and warmth interchange, cool and hot energies intersect. The dynamics of success and decline are both abundant and minimal, following the seasons in their order, resulting in early and late appearances. The movement of yang begins with warmth and peaks in heat; the movement of yin starts with clarity and peaks in cold. This transitions from subtlety to intensity. Just as spring is subdued, summer is harmonious, autumn is numerical, and winter is waning. The residual energies of winter still interact with spring, those of spring with summer, summer with autumn, and autumn with winter, resulting in a transition from abundance to subtlety. The so-called &#39;just&#39; refers to the proper alignment of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The &#39;support&#39; refers to the transitions between spring and summer, summer and autumn, autumn and winter, winter and spring—a dimensional framework in four corners. The energies of the four seasons arise from the supportive to the righteous, and then return from the righteous to the supportive, with cold and warmth intersecting and cool and hot alternating, continuously cycling without end. Thus, when prosperity arrives, it may bring illness; when illness recedes, it may rekindle, indicating the resurgence of energy at a time of prosperity. For instance, in spring, there may be the harsh defeat of the sapling by metal energy. In summer, there may be the overpowering heat of fire overcoming metal.<a id="trans-397p" href="#orig-397p" class="marker">[397p]</a><br>The fiery energy has already begun to stir during the time of excessive illness; this is the restoration of energy emerging early at the primary position of thirty degrees. The restorative energy waits until the excessive energy has dissipated, then it rises in the sweltering heat of summer at its primary position, hence both the excessive energy arises earlier and the restorative energy follows suit. Therefore, when the excessive energy is strong, the restorative energy is abundant; when the excessive energy is mild, the restorative energy is scarce; when the excessive energy is balanced, the restorative energy is also balanced; when the excessive energy is weak and declining, the restorative energy is likewise weak and declining. This is the constant of the way of nature. If the emergence of excessive and restorative energies is out of proper order and arrives late, it is due to the tardiness of the excessive and restorative energies. The birth of energy occurs at the interaction of the preceding energies, just as summer energy arises during late spring. The transformation of energy occurs at the interaction of the subsequent energies, like spring energy flowing into early summer. The energies of excess and restoration vary in strength and decline; thus, there are distinctions of early and late. Indeed, vigorous energy arises from the thirty degrees born prior to the primary position, while weak energy flows post the primary position&#39;s transformation of thirty degrees; hence, it does not align with its position. If the metal energy weakens and is excessive at the turn of spring and summer, then the restorative energy will also weaken, and its restoration during the turn of summer and autumn indicates a void in excess, arriving late. The energies of the four seasons interact; therefore, the fluctuations of excessive and restorative energies follow the exchanges of the seasonal energies, appearing either early or late. Thus, it is said that the application of prosperity and decline is within the four dimensions.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a><br>It is also said, attentively observing the four seasons, that all responses return; their end can be seen, and their beginning can be known. This means that the early and late victories both pertain to the responses of the four seasons, either early by thirty degrees before the beginning, or late by thirty degrees after the end. The emperor asked: How should the pulse respond? Qibo replied: It differs slightly from the proper method, waiting for the right moment to depart.</p>
<p>(Note: This further uses the pulse state to prove the interaction of qi transformation, therefore it is called &quot;Four Seals.&quot; If the qi of spring, summer, autumn, and winter do not interact, then the qi of heaven and earth across the four seasons is all blocked. The &quot;proper&quot; refers to the correct positions of the four seasons. It indicates that the pulse aligns with the proper methods of the four seasons, intersecting before and after. Waiting for the right moment to depart means departing after thirty degrees of the end. For instance, in spring, if it remains dormant, it still belongs to the qi of winter interacting, until the thirtieth day of the last month, at which point spring qi begins to take command alone.) </p>
<p>The essentials of the pulse state are: spring does not allow for unfurling, summer does not sustain, winter does not stagnate, autumn does not enumerate, which is called &quot;Four Seals.&quot;<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a><br>If spring does not anchor, then winter&#39;s energy does not interact with spring; if summer does not resonate, then spring&#39;s energy does not interact with summer; if autumn does not count, then summer&#39;s energy does not interact with autumn; if winter does not flow, then autumn&#39;s energy does not interact with winter. This indicates that the energies of the four seasons do not connect and are obstructed.</p>
<p>Excessive anchoring is called illness, excessive resonance is called illness, excessive flowing is called illness, excessive counting is called illness. Seeing in pairs is called illness; seeing again is called illness. Departing without truly departing is called illness; departing yet remaining is called illness. Reversal indicates death. Thus, it is said, the energies must uphold their roles, just as scales must not lose balance.</p>
<p>The energies of yin and yang require clarity and tranquility for transformation and governance; movement leads to harsh diseases. This is what is meant. The energies of the four seasons are strongest when they are at their primary positions, weak at the beginning of emergence, and faded during conversion; thus, excessive amounts lead to illness. Seeing in pairs refers to the anchoring and resonance occurring together at the beginning of spring, or the resonance and counting together at the beginning of summer. Seeing again means that which has departed returns. Departing without departing means leaving before the thirty-day mark. Departing yet not departing means that one has reached thirty days and should depart but does not. Reversal refers to the problematic pulses visible in the changing seasons.</p>
<p>Thus, it is said, the energies must uphold their roles, just as scales must not become unbalanced. The energies of the four seasons, when maintained in their proper positions and interacting as they should, are like weights not being able to separate. The energies of yin and yang in the four seasons require clarity and tranquility for generation and transformation. Generation occurs first, followed by transformation. Movement indicates chaos in the energies.<a id="trans-400p" href="#orig-400p" class="marker">[400p]</a><br>The Emperor said: How are the realms of darkness and brightness? Qibo replied: The two yangs come together to create brightness, and the two yins converge to represent darkness. The pairing of darkness and brightness corresponds to the differences between cold and heat. </p>
<p>[Note: Darkness and brightness refer to yin and yang. The convergence of the two yins denotes the extreme of yin, hence it is called darkness. The coming together of the two yangs signifies the extreme of yang, hence it is called brightness. When yin reaches its peak, yang is born; when yang reaches its peak, yin is born. Cold departs and heat arrives, and conversely. Therefore, the pairing of darkness and brightness corresponds to the differences in cold and heat.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about the division of the seasons? Qibo replied: The arrival of qi is referred to as &quot;arrival,&quot; while the division of qi is called &quot;division.&quot; When it arrives, the qi is the same; when it is divided, the qi differs. This signifies the correct order of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Qi arrival&quot; refers to the two solstices of winter and summer, while &quot;qi division&quot; pertains to the two equinoxes of spring and autumn. This follows from the previous text, clarifying that the warmth of spring leads to the heat of summer, and the coolness of autumn leads to the cold of winter. The times of the two solstices are associated with the dual qi of cold and heat, while the times of the divisions differ in terms of temperature.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: You say that the qi of spring and autumn begins early, while that of winter and summer begins later; I already understand this. However, the six qi alternate, causing the years to be inconsistent.<a id="trans-401p" href="#orig-401p" class="marker">[401p]</a><br>How should we address supplementation and purging? Qi Bo said: The governing principles above and below should align with what is beneficial, and correctness in flavor is essential. The methods on the left and right follow the same principles. The main points are: the governing principle of the Shao Yang first tastes sweet then salty; the governing principle of the Yang Ming first tastes pungent then sour; the governing principle of the Tai Yang first tastes salty then bitter; the governing principle of the Jue Yin first tastes sour then pungent; the governing principle of the Shao Yin first tastes sweet then salty; the governing principle of the Tai Yin first tastes bitter then sweet. Augment with what is beneficial and support with what is generated; this is called obtaining Qi.</p>
<p>[Note: The Qi of spring and autumn begins with those preceding; spring occurs before the halfway point of the year, and autumn occurs after it. The Qi of summer and winter comes after these two, referred to as the governing Qi of the four seasons. The six Qi that arise and recede lead to irregularities in the years, referred to as visitor Qi. The six phases rotate without a fixed position. This section discusses the interactions between the governing Qi of the four seasons, focusing on acquiring pure and tranquil Qi. If one does not follow the sequence and takes excessive actions in response to visitor Qi, complications may arise. Therefore, the governing principles above and below, and the Qi between left and right, should align with what is beneficial and correct in flavor for regulation, as this is essential. The main principle should be to purge before supplementing, as it relates to supporting the benefits of the governing Qi and nurturing what the governing Qi produces, thus embodying the seasonal Qi and facilitating transformation and interaction.]<a id="trans-402p" href="#orig-402p" class="marker">[402p]</a><br><strong>Gate of Luck</strong></p>

<p>Changes in the movement of qi lead to epidemics.<a id="trans-404p" href="#orig-404p" class="marker">[404p]</a><br>The Five Movements and Six Qis are the regular principles of the rise and fall of Yin and Yang in heaven and earth. The flow of the Five Movements has disparities of excess and deficiency; the rise and fall of the Six Qis has differences between opposition and compliance. Anything not aligned with the virtue and governance of the state leads to calamities that can afflict people. Therefore, these are called the seasonal energies.</p>
<p>The Ten Heavenly Stems paired together form the Five Movements:</p>
<p>Jia and Ji combine to create the Earth Movement; Jia, the firm Wood, overcomes Ji, the yielding Earth.<br>Yi and Geng combine to create the Metal Movement; Yi, the yielding Wood, unites with Geng, the firm Metal.<br>Ding and Ren combine to create the Wood Movement; Ding, the Yin Fire, pairs with Ren, the Yang Water.<br>Bing and Xin combine to create the Water Movement; Bing, the Yang Fire, marries Xin, the yielding Metal.<br>Wu and Gui combine to create the Fire Movement; Wu, the Yang Soil, marries Gui, the Yin Water.</p>
<p>The excess and deficiency of the Five Movements:</p>
<p>The Yang firm husband represents excess, while the Yin yielding wife represents deficiency; this is a brief explanation. Every sixty years culminates in the cycle of Jia-Zi, where there are seasonal movements controlled by heaven called the Celestial Symbol and linked to the earthly branches known as the Annual Assembly. The Meng Year is also referred to as the Branch Virtue Symbol. When the annual movement governs the Earth, the firm represents the Celestial Symbol, while the yielding signifies the Annual Assembly. There are twenty-nine such years in total. Excess directed by heaven, termed Heavenly Punishment. On the day of major cold at the intersection of energies, those whose timings and movements pair as husband and wife are called the Cosmic Virtue Symbol. These do not represent excess or deficiency but rather the energies of the year and movement. The years of Shen, Zi, and Chen begin in Yin, and those of Si, You, and Chou start in Si, whereas those of Yin, Wu, and Xu commence in Shen, and those of Hai, Mao, and Wei begin in Hai as the energies intersect.<a id="trans-405p" href="#orig-405p" class="marker">[405p]</a><br>The Twelve Branches correspond to the Six Qi, Three Yin, and Three Yang.</p>
<p>The Six Qi are the foundation, while the Three Yin and Three Yang are the markers.<br>Zi and Wu correspond to Shaoyin and the fire of Jun (Summer); Chou and Wei correspond to Taiyin and the dampness of Earth; Yin and Shen correspond to Shaoyang and the fire of Xiang (Great Heat); Mao and You correspond to Yangming and the dryness of Metal; Chen and Xu correspond to Taiyang and the coldness of Water; Si and Hai correspond to Jueyin and the wind of Wood.</p>
<p>The Six Qi can be excess or deficient.</p>
<p>Meng represents the least, Zhong represents the moderate, and Ji represents the most. In the &quot;Neijing,&quot; Yin and Yang are represented by the four Meng (Yin, Shen, Si, Hai); the four Zhong (Zi, Wu, Mao, You) represent two Yin and two Yang; the four seasons (Chen, Xu, Chou, Wei) represent three Yin and three Yang. Shaoyang leads and thus signifies emptiness and slight changes; Shaoyin follows and thus signifies stability, heaviness, and abundance. Therefore, wind and fire are chaotic, with Yang leading and appearing less in Meng; cold and dampness are calm, with Yin following and appearing more in Ji. Dryness and heat each find balance in the center, thus residing moderately in Zhong. Note: The quantity of Qi refers to the Six Qi; the vitality refers to the Five Movements.<a id="trans-406p" href="#orig-406p" class="marker">[406p]</a><br><strong>The Six Phases of Qi and Their Corresponding Positions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first phase of Qi begins from the winter solstice to the spring equinox. The realm of the Wind and Wood of the Lesser Yin is in action, and the Qi is weak. Thus, it is said that after the winter solstice, the day of Jiazi is governed by the Lesser Yang. However, during this period, there are no constant standards to follow, and it is generally divided. One month into winter denotes the transition when cold meets the initial Qi. In a year, there are six cycles of Jiazi corresponding to the six types of Qi, and all follow this pattern. The first Qi is represented in the first and second months. The pulse varies in size and duration, reflecting seasonal changes and the manifestations of Wind and Wood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second phase of Qi lasts from the spring equinox to the Lesser Fullness. This is the position of the Fire of the Lesser Yin. The Yang Qi is clear, right in between the two Yangs that merge brightly, hence it is also referred to as the Yang Bright. The pulse is string-like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third phase of Qi stretches from the Lesser Fullness to the Greater Heat. This is the position of the Fire of the Lesser Yang. All things flourish as the Yang Qi is abundant, which is why it is also called the Greater Yang. The pulse is large and long.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fourth phase of Qi runs from the Greater Heat to the autumn equinox. This position pertains to the Moist Earth of the Greater Yin. While the Qi of the atmosphere remains strong, the Yin has started to manifest after summer, hence it is termed the Greater Yin. This triad of Yin and Yang along with the six phases differ from the basic Yin and Yang. The pulse is slow, large, and long; any mention of it being tight, large, and long is due to transcription errors.<a id="trans-407p" href="#orig-407p" class="marker">[407p]</a><br>Wet earth governs slow, large, and long; dry metal governs tight, slender, and short. With all things being moist or dry, this is clearly observable. When the damp earth is abundant, the skin pores are open and sweat flows, hence the pulse, though large and long, is weak and cannot be tight. Come autumn, as the energy declines and cold suddenly closes in, the pulse, though slight and thin, becomes tight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The energy of the fifth phase arrives from the autumn equinox to the minor snow, situated in the dry metal of the yangming. The energy wanes and yin rises, thus it is also called the shaoyin governor; the pulse is tight, slender, and faint. </p>
<p>The energy of the end phase, also known as the sixth phase, spans from minor snow to major cold, located in the cold water of the taiyang. Yin reaches its peak, completely diminishing the energy that is hidden and stored, therefore it is called the jueyin governor. &quot;Jue&quot; means to end. The pulse becomes deep, short, and solid. All things are stored within, cold energy blocks flow, hindering the skin and liquid energy from dispersing, hence the pulse is deep, short, yet vigorous, solid, and as hard as stone. </p>
<p>In general, for the four seasons and six positions, if the pulse is excessively strong, the seasonal energy is surplus and causes illness; for instance, if the spring pulse is too strong, it results in wind-related illness. Conversely, if the energy is insufficient, it leads to illness; indeed, the summer pulse seen as excessive in the autumn may reflect this idea. For example, a slow pulse indicates cold, while a rapid pulse suggests heat. </p>
<p><strong>Five Movements Govern Illness:</strong></p>
<p>All winds and dizziness are associated with the liver wood.<br>All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers are associated with the heart fire.<a id="trans-408p" href="#orig-408p" class="marker">[408p]</a><br>All forms of swelling and fullness are associated with the spleen and earth.<br>All ailments of phlegm and weakness are linked to the lungs and metal.<br>All cold that constricts and draws in is related to the kidneys and water.</p>
<pre><code>          Six Qi as Disease
</code></pre>
<p>All instances of sudden rigidity, limb pain with weakness, abdominal urgency with cramping belong to wind.<br>All diseases manifesting as wheezing, vomiting sour substances, sudden diarrhea, muscular cramps, cloudy urination, abdominal distension that sounds like a drum, abscesses and sores, tumors and nodules, vomiting and diarrheal cholera, dizziness and swelling, nasal congestion and bleeding, excessive bleeding, difficulty urinating, body heat with aversion to cold, shivering and confusion, laughter and weeping, and sweating with nosebleeds belong to heat.<br>All instances of spasms and rigidity, accumulation of fluids, fullness and stagnation in the middle, cholera with vomiting and diarrhea, heavy feeling and swelling of the body, flesh like mud that does not rebound when pressed belong to dampness.<br>All instances of heat-induced dizziness and trembling, sudden hoarseness, impulsive behavior, irritability, violent outbursts, painful swelling, reverse Qi rushing upwards, chilling sweats as if one has lost their spirit, sneezing and vomiting, ulcers, throat obstruction, tinnitus and deafness, vomiting and overflow, inability to eat, unclear vision, sudden cramping, rapid onset illness, and sudden death belong to fire.<br>All instances of dryness, barrenness, cracking, and roughness belong to dryness.<a id="trans-409p" href="#orig-409p" class="marker">[409p]</a><br>The Hand Yangming is associated with the energy of the lungs and the large intestine. All diseases manifest from above and below, with water and fluids being clear and cool. Symptoms include tumors, hard abdominal distension, urgent pain, diarrhea with clear fluid, lack of hunger after eating, vomiting foul substances, difficulty in flexing and extending, counterflow and rigidity—all pertain to cold. The Foot Taiyang relates to the energy of the kidneys and the bladder.</p>
<p>Regarding the regulation of energy, treating diseases must clarify the six transformations for separate treatments, the five flavors corresponding to five colors, the associations with the five organs, the operation of the five elements, and the influence of the six energies. Therefore, understanding the numbers of yin and yang is crucial, as the combined numbers are observable. The principles of yin and yang can extend into tens and potentially thousands, yet the yin and yang of heaven and earth are represented not merely by numbers but by their symbols. </p>
<p>The classics state: the energy of the Red Sky converges at the position of the Ox and the Maiden; the energy of the Black Sky flows through the Heart Tail; the energy of the Green Sky traverses the Ghost Willow in the Dangerous Room; the energy of the White Sky circulates at the Shang constellation; the energy of the Original Sky passes through Zhang, Wing, and the Stomach. The aforementioned positions mark the portal of heaven and earth, thus the initial three numbers illuminate the great symbols, while the six energies of beginning and end govern the heights and depths, pertaining to the shallow and deep springs. This differentiation is essential to understand the transformations of heaven and earth and the energies that correspond to the people&#39;s illnesses.<a id="trans-410p" href="#orig-410p" class="marker">[410p]</a><br>In what is called the governance of the Sun over Heaven, the year is thus suited to be bitter, dry, and warm. Under the governance of Yangming over Heaven, the year is suited to be both bitter and pungent, to sweat, clear, and disperse; it should also be accompanied by salty flavors. Under the governance of Shaoyang over Heaven, the year is suited to salty flavors, as well as to being pungent and sour, to seep, drain, burst forth, and unleash. Observe the cold and warmth to adjust the qi. Under the governance of the Sun over Heaven, it is appropriate to be bitter, dry, and warm; in severe cases, to burst forth and drain. If not released, warmth will overflow, causing flesh to rot and skin to tear, with water and blood intermixing. The year of Shaoyin should be regulated with pungent flavors, moistened with salty, while also needing to break its stagnant qi, first nurturing its transformational source, thus greeting it and taking it away, the method of royal qi. Therefore, it is said: when the six qi are excessive, using heat as the governance of Heaven, the year should be softened with salty flavors and adjusted above, in severe cases to be released with bitterness, to collect below with sourness and stabilize it, and in severe cases to drain with bitterness. Under the governance of Jueyin over Heaven, far from heat, use warm to distance warmth, cold to distance cold, and cool to distance cool; food should follow this method—this is its principle.<a id="trans-411p" href="#orig-411p" class="marker">[411p]</a><br>Therefore, Wang commented: In summer, if the cold is extreme, it can violate heat; if the cold is not extreme, it cannot. There are external symptoms and internal symptoms; hence the law states that one should not induce heat when the cold is not overpowering, and should not attack when heat is not overpowering. If one does not induce nor attack yet violates both cold and heat, then the internal cold and heat can invade each other, worsening the condition. Thus, what is absent generates, what is present worsens. Therefore, if one does not induce heat, heat will arrive; if one does not induce cold, cold will arrive. When cold arrives, diseases such as hardness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea will emerge. When heat arrives, there will be symptoms like body heat, nausea, chaotic diarrhea, boils, ulcers, confusion, excessive lethargy, shivering, swelling, vomiting blood, nosebleeds, headaches, and pains in the joints, along with conditions of excess blood leaking, obstructed urination, and so forth. Wang also commented: If one has eaten and yet feels not hungry, vomits foul matter, this is also a symptom of cold illness. Sudden muteness and confusion, inability to recognize others, restlessness and mania, incoherent speech and curses, fright and convulsions, these are symptoms of heat illness. Therefore, as the classics say, there should be no loss of harmony with the heavens, no opposing qi, no reliance on victory, and no reinforcement of recovery; this is called the ultimate principle.<a id="trans-412p" href="#orig-412p" class="marker">[412p]</a><br>If one does not understand this, internal cold and heat can invade, losing the proper balance of qi, leading to ignorance of the four seasons and five elements. This results in mutual overcoming, dispelling evil and attacking the righteous, shortening human life. The art that does not align with the classics becomes a warning against rudimentary practitioners. Therefore, the six qi oversee the nine palaces, which in turn oversee the nine sources, and the nine appropriations below. The three numbers are clear, each discerning the main from the guest, managing excess, and conquering diseases. The thickness and thinness of seasonal qi and flavors, as the classics state, have both weight and lightness, activity and stillness, and the quantity of treatment and preservation varies in depth. Thus, when the lesser yang is at the spring point, cold toxins do not arise; when the greater yang is at spring, heat toxins do not arise. Hence, its qi is concentrated, and its flavor is correct. When the lesser yin is at spring, cold toxins do not arise; when the greater yin is at spring, dry toxins do not arise. This is called the transformation of heaven and earth, thus when the qi of heaven and earth converges, the six seasons subdivide and myriad things are transformed and born. The classics convey that one should carefully observe the appropriate qi to avoid missing the opportunity for treatment. The disease mechanisms are cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; from this, all diseases arise. Therefore, by carefully examining the root of disease mechanisms, and understanding the essence of treatment, one can cure ailments. However, it is rare for one to clearly understand the appropriate conditions of the six qi and five elements, the thickness and thinness of flavors, and the use of these in relation to the body as the source of illness, while still achieving results.<a id="trans-413p" href="#orig-413p" class="marker">[413p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Duty to Parents</strong> (By Zhang Congzheng in the Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>The nine qi (vital energies) affect ailments and are treated accordingly.</p>
<p>Heaven uses qi to illuminate, and the earth uses qi to sustain. All things flourish between heaven and earth and are born through qi. When they are ill, they are all afflicted by qi. The qi of wind is gentle and opens the pores; the qi of heat is warm and promotes growth; the qi of fire is fiery and drives activities; the qi of moisture is heavy and burdensome; the qi of dryness is clear and harsh; the qi of cold is chilling and retreats to conceal. These six types of qi are the natural transformations of the seasons. </p>
<p>When they change, the wind qi can become furious and revert to cold; the heat qi can swell and revert to chill; the fire qi can whip through and revert to frost; the moisture qi can pour down like thunder and revert to fierce winds; the dry qi can scatter and revert to dampness; the cold qi can produce snow, frost, and hail, reverting to white dust. These are the variations of the six qi.</p>
<p>Thus, if it is cold for a long time, it should be treated with warmth; if it is cool for a long time, it should be treated with heat; if it is dim for a long time, it should be treated with brightness; if it is clear for a long time, it should be treated with rain. The qi of heaven and earth is stable when constant, and it becomes ill when it changes. Moreover, humans inherit the qi of heaven and earth; the five transformations invade from outside, while the seven emotions conflict within. This is why sages treasure qi as if it were a precious jewel, while the common people utilize it and harm the harmony of nature. Hence, Xuan and Qi discuss that all pains arise from qi, that all illnesses are born from qi, and so arises the concept of the nine different qi. Qi itself is one, yet it manifests as nine due to interactions. The so-called nine refers to anger, joy, sorrow, fear, cold, heat, shock, thought, and labor.<a id="trans-414p" href="#orig-414p" class="marker">[414p]</a><br>It is said: When angry, the qi reverses; when severe, it can lead to vomiting blood and diarrhea, hence the qi rises. The Grand Master Wang noted: Anger causes the yang qi to rise and the liver wood to overpower the spleen, which leads to vomiting blood and diarrhea when severe. When joyous, the qi is harmonious and the spirit is free, thus the qi becomes gentle. When sad, the heart is constricted, the lung&#39;s leaves are raised, and the upper burner becomes obstructed, causing the essence and defense to not disperse, leading to trapped warmth within, hence the qi dwindles. When frightened, the essence retreats, which leads to the closure of the upper burner; if closed, the qi reverses, and if it reverses, the lower burner becomes distended, thus the qi does not flow. It is also said: Fear harms the essence, causing it to rise and not descend, the yin qi of the lower burner also circulates and does not disperse, leading to accumulation and distension. Therefore, if the upper burner is constrained, and the qi of the lower burner reverses, the qi does not flow. The new revision states: &quot;not flowing&quot; should be read as &quot;flowing downward&quot;; cold causes the pores to close, and the qi descends, thus the qi is collected. Grand Master Wang further remarked: When the body is cool, the defense qi sinks, causing the skin&#39;s pores and places of excretion to close tightly, and the qi does not circulate, hence the defense qi contracts inward and does not disperse. When heated, the pores open, allowing the defense to flow, resulting in significant sweating, thus the qi is released. Additionally, it is said: When a person is in the yang state, they are relaxed; when in the yin state, they are despondent, hence when hot, the skin&#39;s pores open, allowing the defense to circulate significantly, leading to fluid drainage and considerable sweating. When startled, the heart has no foundation, the spirit has no resting place, and thoughts lack resolution, causing the qi to become chaotic. When exhausted, there is wheezing and sweating, and both inside and outside are overwhelmed, thus the qi is consumed. Moreover, excessive labor causes the qi to rush quickly, leading to wheezing. When the qi rushes quickly, the yang projects outward, resulting in sweating. Both internally and externally exceed the usual limits, hence the qi is depleted.<a id="trans-415p" href="#orig-415p" class="marker">[415p]</a><br>When one thinks, the mind has something to hold onto, and the spirit has a place to return; if the righteous energy remains but does not act, then the energy becomes stagnant. Furthermore, when the heart is tied and does not scatter, the energy also stays. This discussion of the nine energies in the &quot;Su Wen&quot; is quite detailed, and its principles are very clear. However, it briefly addresses the diseases caused by the nine energies, only discussing vomiting blood and diarrhea, while leaving the rest unmentioned. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; on the other hand discusses the illnesses caused by thoughts and emotions such as sadness, joy, anger, fear, and worry. It states: Those who understand how to nurture life must align with the four seasons, adapt to cold and heat, harmonize joy and anger, and ensure a peaceful living situation. They should balance yin and yang, harmonize rigidity and flexibility; by doing so, evils will not approach, leading to long life and lasting vision. Therefore, excessive anxiety and worry harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to unending desires. Sadness drains one’s life force and results in loss; joy and happiness scatter the spirit, preventing it from being contained; worries cause energy to become blocked and stagnant; intense anger confuses the spirit and prevents healing; fear causes the spirit to become scattered and unsettled.<a id="trans-416p" href="#orig-416p" class="marker">[416p]</a><br>Fear and constant worry harm the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, it leads to fear and loss, causing decay in bodily flesh and hair, pallor, and death in winter. Spleen sorrow that remains unresolved harms the will; if the will is harmed, it causes disarray, leaving the limbs unable to move, leading to hair loss, pallor, and death in spring. Grief affecting the liver harms the soul; if the soul is harmed, it results in madness and forgetfulness, lacking precision and correctness, causing the body to shrink and the muscles to cramp, with hair loss, pallor, and death in autumn. Unrestrained joy of the lungs harms the ghost within; if the ghost is harmed, it leads to madness where one loses awareness of oneself, with the skin scorched, hair loss, pallor, and death in summer. Anger overwhelming the kidneys harms the will; if the will is harmed, joy is lost and past intentions are forgotten, leading to an inability to bend or stretch the back, hair loss, pallor, and death in late summer. Constant fear and not resolving it harms essence; if essence is harmed, it causes bone pain and weakness, leading to loss of vitality. Thus, the five organs are responsible for storing essence, and should not be harmed. If harmed, one loses balance, leading to a deficiency of yin; without sufficient yin, there can be no energy, and ultimately, death ensues.<a id="trans-417p" href="#orig-417p" class="marker">[417p]</a><br>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; discusses the diseases arising from emotions, spirit, soul, and essence, but if there are no cold, heat, shock, or labor as evidence, I therefore expand on it: </p>
<p>When anger prevails, it leads to vomiting blood, diarrhea, convulsions, fainting, yang collapse, chest fullness and side pain, belching with reversed qi that does not descend, shortness of breath and thirst, restlessness, consumption, accumulated phlegm, sudden blindness, sudden deafness, muscle spasms manifesting externally, and abscesses.</p>
<p>When joy prevails, it leads to uncontrollable laughter, burning hair, internal diseases, failure to contain yang energy, and in severe cases, mania.</p>
<p>When sorrow prevails, it results in yin contraction, muscle cramps, paralysis of the flesh, weak pulse, bloody urine in men, uterine bleeding in women, sour nasal discharge, blurred vision, insufficient breath for inhalation, and numbness in the arms when weeping.</p>
<p>When fear prevails, it can cause fractures, muscle atrophy, sudden greenish diarrhea, heated face with urgent skin, impotence, and collapsing from fright.</p>
<p>When shock prevails, it results in drooling, blurred vision, disordered speech, seizures, loss of consciousness, stiff paralysis, and prolonged pain and numbness.<a id="trans-418p" href="#orig-418p" class="marker">[418p]</a><br>When anger is directed inward, it can lead to various ailments: difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, back pain, weakness of the bones, lung noise, bone decay, impotence, coughing up blood, dim vision, ear blockage, low sperm production in men, irregular menstrual cycles in women. If it becomes severe, it may lead to a breakdown and uncontrollable flow.</p>
<p>When thoughts are distressed, it results in insomnia, excessive sleepiness, confusion, abdominal discomfort, blockage in the triple warmer, difficulty in swallowing, bitter vomiting, muscle weakness, excessive sexual desire, and a sense of debilitation that feels like exhaustion, leading to a lack of appetite.</p>
<p>When coldness affects the body, it can cause water discharge from the upper and lower parts, clear and cold liquid, diarrhea that is clear and white, foul vomiting, loss of appetite after eating, a hard sensation in the abdomen with urgent pain, lumps or hernias, difficulty in movement, and a firm retention of qi.<a id="trans-419p" href="#orig-419p" class="marker">[419p]</a><br>When the qi is obstructed, it leads to symptoms such as wheezing, vomiting of sour substances, sudden spasms, cloudy urination, abdominal distension that sounds like a drum when tapped, sores and ulcers, lumps and nodules, vomiting and diarrhea, cholera, mental confusion, swelling, nasal blockage, nosebleeds, excessive bleeding, urinary retention, fever, and aversion to cold. In severe cases, it can result in convulsions, blurred vision, tinnitus or deafness, agitation, madness, curses, and fright. One may feel as if possessed, with qi reversing and surging upwards, spitting out foul substances, inability to eat, abdominal swelling and pain, sudden hoarseness and collapse, and sudden illness leading to death. All these nine symptoms have treatment methods in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;, typically addressed through the principle of the Five Elements overcoming one another. For instance, anger harms the liver, which belongs to wood; when angry, qi becomes stuck in the liver, thereby allowing pathogens to affect the spleen. When wood is excessive, the liver itself also becomes ill.<a id="trans-420p" href="#orig-420p" class="marker">[420p]</a><br>Joy injures the heart; the heart belongs to fire. When joyful, the spirit unites with the heart, while the lungs, representing metal, are harmed. Excessive fire causes the heart to be ill as well. Grief injures the lungs; the lungs belong to metal. When grieving, the spirit unites with the lungs, while the liver, representing wood, is harmed. Excessive metal causes the lungs to be ill as well. Fear injures the kidneys; the kidneys belong to water. When fearful, the spirit unites with the kidneys, while the heart&#39;s fire is harmed. Excessive water causes the kidneys to be ill as well. Thoughtfulness injures the spleen; the spleen belongs to earth. When overly thoughtful, the spirit unites with the spleen, while the kidneys&#39; water is harmed. Excessive earth causes the spleen to be ill as well. Cold injures the body; the body belongs to yin. When cold overcomes heat, the yang becomes ill. Excessive cold also harms yin. Heat injures the qi; qi belongs to yang. When heat overcomes cold, the yin becomes ill. Excessive heat also harms yang. All of these seven conditions influence each other. Thus, sorrow can remedy anger; one can touch others with words of compassion and suffering. Joy can also remedy sorrow.<a id="trans-421p" href="#orig-421p" class="marker">[421p]</a><br>To amuse others with playful and teasing words; fear can be managed with sudden and frightening words related to death; anger can be treated by touching thoughts with insults and deception; thought can be managed by addressing fears with considerations of others&#39; intentions; these five methods must be deceitful and strange, without limits, in order to truly affect people’s ears and eyes, and easily manipulate their perceptions. If one lacks inner resources, they cannot employ these five methods. Heat can treat cold; external cold can be relieved with heated needles (that is, using fire) to warm and induce sweating; internal cold can be treated with warm food and balms to stabilize it. Cold can also remedy heat; external heat can be alleviated with cool environments, thin clothing, and cooling solutions to induce sweating; internal heat should be addressed with cold drinks and remedies for balance. Only rest can remedy labor; the scriptures state that labor requires warmth, meaning to conserve and nurture. </p>
<p>Today’s doctors regard warmth as a gentle remedy, but they have strayed from this principle for too long. Qi Bo stated that rest is essential; it also refers to relaxation. Only practice can remedy shock; the texts mention that shock must be calmed, referring to the ordinary. Shock occurs suddenly and unexpectedly; familiarity through repeated exposure helps one become desensitized to shock. These nine aspects are defined in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and are disregarded by mediocre practitioners. In our time, Liu Hejian addressed the five emotions, deriving insights beyond words, suggesting that these emotions originate from the heart. Thus, in observing signs of joy, anger, sadness, fear, and thought, they all fundamentally rely on a balanced heart&#39;s energy. As for labor, which results from movement and is categorized as yang, shock arises from the heart which corresponds to fire, and both are likewise dependent on the balanced heart.<a id="trans-422p" href="#orig-422p" class="marker">[422p]</a><br>The physicians of today do not understand this principle, which has led to slander about cold and heat, creating a ruckus among the people, and the scholars and officials are misled by it. When will public opinion settle? In the past, I treated a scholar who was overworked, with severe constipation, cough, and reverse qi, producing a hoarse sound in his throat, and spitting up fresh blood. I administered a bitter decoction to detoxify, adding Huanglian and Muscone, taken gradually. I also used a concoction of Muscone and Areca nut to alleviate his reverse qi, and within a little over a month, he recovered. </p>
<p>I have once treated a person plagued by deep sorrow using a mixture of methods, where I would accompany acupuncture with sounds from bamboo flutes and drums to address worries and heart pain. I have also knocked on doors and windows, ensuring the sound did not cease, to help those frightened by sudden noises—restoring their spirit. Additionally, I treated a woman who could not sleep due to prolonged thoughts; I acted drunk and did not inquire, and she, in her anger, fell asleep that very night.<a id="trans-423p" href="#orig-423p" class="marker">[423p]</a><br>I have also used sour jujube seed pills to treat people with excessive worry; I have employed Bai Hu Decoction without regard to the seasons to regulate individuals during the heat. I further used Wuyou Powder to treat those who suffered from cold obstruction in winter due to dampness, and then administered a modified Ma Huang Decoction twice as one dose, simmered with jujubes and ginger, to induce sweating for recovery; if not healed, I would use Gua Di Powder to promote sweating, assisted by heat. The same method applies to treating cold and contraction. I once treated a patient with a severe heat illness; when all medicines proved ineffective, I pricked several points on their head, leading to immediate recovery upon bloodletting. The treatments I provided felt as if I were reaching into a pouch. Only those who are exhausted or fearful are difficult to heal. Those who are happy have fewer ailments, as all their channels are relaxed and harmonious. In the past, I heard that Mr. Yang from Shandong treated a provincial leader suffering from continuous leakage without response. Initially, Mr. Yang did not address the patient directly, talking instead with others about the movements of the sun, moon, and stars.<a id="trans-424p" href="#orig-424p" class="marker">[424p]</a><br>In times of wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, from the time of the Dragon to the time of the Sheep, the sick would listen and forget their ailments. Yang once said: For those suffering from chronic ailments, one must first inquire about their interests. For those who love chess, play chess with them; for those who enjoy music, do not cease playing the flute and sheng. I also heard of Master Zhuang, who treated a patient with the utmost joy and music, but when he felt the patient&#39;s pulse, he lost his voice and pretended to leave for medicine. Days passed without him returning, and the patient, in despair, bid farewell to their family and friends, saying, &quot;I won&#39;t be here for long.&quot; Zhuang knew the patient would recover and comforted them. When questioned about this, Zhuang referred to the &quot;Plain Questions&quot; saying, &quot;Fear outweighs joy.&quot; These two men could be said to have grasped the essence of healing. However, Hua Yuan was nearly killed out of anger towards the county magistrate, while Wen Zhi was ultimately killed due to his anger toward the King of Qi. Among thousands of people, only one or two may find such misfortune. If the arts of medicine are so exquisitely delicate that they cannot ensure one’s safety, then they are indeed a cheap skill. Alas!<a id="trans-425p" href="#orig-425p" class="marker">[425p]</a><br><strong>The Four Influences of Internal and External Factors</strong></p>
<p>Externally, there are wind, cold, heat, and dampness, which are the four seasonal influences from heaven, and they are formless; internally, there are hunger, fullness, exertion, and rest, which are also the four seasonal influences from heaven, and they are tangible. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first refers to illnesses that arise from the movement of qi resulting in internal conditions, such as the accumulation of conditions, nodules, and the onset of tumors, thyroid issues, abscesses, and mental disturbances.<br>Explanation: &#39;Zheng&#39; refers to hardness and accumulation. &#39;Jia&#39; refers to qi and blood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second refers to illnesses caused by the movement of qi resulting in external conditions, such as sores, ulcers, scabies, varicose veins, swellings, reddened eyes, pain, and itching.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third refers to illnesses arising internally that are not due to the movement of qi, such as the accumulation of fluids, food habits, hunger, fullness, fatigue, and emotional disturbances like sorrow, fear, joy, and anger.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fourth refers to illnesses arising externally that are not due to the movement of qi, such as miasma, toxic entities, bites or stings from insects or snakes, influences from the dead, as well as exposure to wind, cold, heat, and dampness, and injuries from knives or sharp objects.<a id="trans-426p" href="#orig-426p" class="marker">[426p]</a><br><strong>Diseases of Wind and Wood Stagnation</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The populace suffers from pain in the stomach and heart, with afflictions on both sides of the torso; the throat is blocked, and food and drink cannot be swallowed. In severe cases, there are tinnitus and dizziness, loss of visual recognition, tendency to faint, and stiffened muscles and bones, leading to collapse with no awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Diseases of Heat and Summer Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>The populace suffers from weakness, sores and ulcers, swollen stiff areas in the sides, chest, back, head, and limbs, with abdominal distension, vomiting, and reverse flow. There may be spasms, bone pain, joint discomfort, and conditions such as diarrhea. Additionally, there may be heat stroke, sudden violent abdominal pain, and profuse bleeding; the essence can diminish, eyes may redden, and there may be heart pain. In severe cases, there is confusion and distress, leading to sudden death.<a id="trans-427p" href="#orig-427p" class="marker">[427p]</a></p>
<h3>Illness of Damp Accumulation</h3>
<p>The people suffer from a bloated sensation in the heart and abdomen, with rumbling intestines leading to many occurrences; in severe cases, chest pain and side pain occur, along with vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in swelling and heaviness due to heat in the spleen.</p>
<h3>Illness of Dry Metal Accumulation</h3>
<p>The people suffer from reverse coughing, a full heart and abdomen, and sharp pain in the lower abdomen that prevents turning side to side. There is dryness in the throat, a dusty appearance, and a sickly complexion, as metal prevails over wood.</p>
<h3>Illness of Cold Water Accumulation</h3>
<p>The people suffer from cold-induced heart pain, waist and lumbar pain, restricted joint movement that makes bending difficult, along with sudden faintness, hard distension, and abdominal fullness, as the yin overwhelms the yang.</p>
<h3>Initial Qi</h3>
<p>From the coldest winter until the spring equinox, in the position of the wind-wood of jueyin, yang energy engages while qi is weak, thus it is called shaoyang. It follows the principle of the first day of the heavenly stem of jiazi, always aligning with the initial qi of great cold, responding to the six qi with their respective heavenly stems, each ruling over two months. The first and second months belong to shaoyang, and likewise for the three yin and three yang.</p>
<h3>Second Qi</h3>
<p>From the spring equinox to the minor fullness, it is the position of the shao-yin fire lord; the yang qi is clear and bright, also in the position of yangming.</p>
<h3>Third Qi</h3>
<p>From minor fullness to major heat, it is the position of the shao-yang fire minister; the yang qi emerges, all things reach maturity, hence it is also referred to as the flourishing taiyang. Its pulse is vast and long. The heavenly weather and all things echo one another, flourishing and waning in nature.<a id="trans-428p" href="#orig-428p" class="marker">[428p]</a></p>
<h3>The Four Energies</h3>
<p>When the Great Heat arrives until the Autumn Equinox, the position of the Great Yin is in wet earth; the weather is auspicious, and the summer&#39;s post-Yin has already engaged, thus it is said that the Great Yin is flourishing. This is different from the three Yin and three Yang symbolizing the weather. The pulse is slow, large, and long. The Dry Metal is flourishing, tight, fine, short, and muddy, manifesting that all things are dry and visibly clear.</p>
<h3>The Five Energies</h3>
<p>From the Autumn Equinox to the Minor Snow, the position of the Yang Brightness is in Dry Metal; the energy is declining while Yin is flourishing, thus it is said that Metal energy is robust, and the pulse is fine and subtle.</p>
<h3>The Final Energy</h3>
<p>From the Minor Cold to the Major Cold, the position of the Sun is in Cold Water; Yin reaches its extremity and concludes, thus it is said that the Rebellious Yin is flourishing. &quot;Rebellious&quot; means to exhaust.</p>
<h3>Wind Wood Liver Sour (Achieving Acupuncture)</h3>
<p>It is paired with the Gallbladder, corresponds to the East Wood, has a blue color, corresponds to the eyes, and governs blood. Peony has a slightly sour and cold flavor, Alisma is salty and neutral, and Black Plum is sour and warm. All winds causing vertigo belong to the Liver Wood and are proactive. The treatment method is called &quot;achieving,&quot; meaning to expel; the high ones should be surpassed. One can puncture Da Dun (Great Surge) or apply moxibustion similarly.</p>
<h3>Summer Fire Heart Bitter (Inducing Sweat)</h3>
<p>It is paired with the Small Intestine. The fire color of the South corresponds to the tongue and governs the blood circulation through the meridians. Rhubarb is bitter and cold, Wood Fragrance is bitter and warm, Coptis is bitter and cool, and Myrrh is bitter and warm. All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers belong to Heart Fire. The treatment method is to induce sweat for those who are hot, allowing dispersal. One can puncture Shao Chong (Lesser Surge) or apply moxibustion similarly.<a id="trans-429p" href="#orig-429p" class="marker">[429p]</a><br><strong>Moist Earth Spleen Sweet (Seizing Needle)</strong></p>
<p>This is related to the stomach. It is the central earth, yellow in color, corresponds with the lips, governs the muscles, and corresponds to the four seasons. Honey is sweet and cool; licorice is sweet and neutral. All swellings due to moisture belong to the spleen earth. The treatment method states that &quot;seizing&quot; means to purge, dividing Yin and Yang to facilitate water pathways. You may puncture the Hidden White point, and moxibustion is also effective.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Metal Lung Spicy (Clearing Needle)</strong></p>
<p>This is related to the large intestine. It corresponds to the west, is metal, white in color, affects the skin and hair, and the nose also aids in Qi flow. Dried ginger is spicy and hot, fresh ginger is spicy and warm, mint is spicy and cool. All stagnant Qi belongs to the lung metal. The treatment method states that &quot;clearing&quot; means to clear the diaphragm, promote urination, and resolve exterior conditions. You may puncture the Lesser Merchant point, and moxibustion is also effective.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Water Kidney Salty (Bending Needle)</strong></p>
<p>This is related to the bladder. It corresponds to the north, is water, black in color, affects the ears, and governs the bone marrow. Oyster is salty and cold; leech is salty and cold. All cold contractions belong to the kidney water. The treatment method states that &quot;bending&quot; refers to suppressing and controlling its rebellious nature. You may puncture the Springing Point, and moxibustion is also effective.</p>
<p><strong>Great Cold, Initial Qi</strong></p>
<p>The initial Qi is often associated with illnesses such as frequent cough, wind phlegm, wind stroke, excessive saliva, blockages, crooked mouth, hemiplegia, loss of voice, wind mania, and being in the wind. For women, there may be fluid retention in the chest, slight pain in the abdomen around the umbilicus, nausea and vomiting, rapid movements leading to anxiety and mania, and heart wind spasms. For illnesses related to initial Qi, it is advisable to disperse by using gourd stem powder and promote downward discharge.<a id="trans-430p" href="#orig-430p" class="marker">[430p]</a><br><strong>Spring Equinox: The Second Vital Qi</strong></p>
<p>The second vital qi leads to diseases that frequently manifest as wind-heat and wind-warmth. The classics state: wind injures the yang, while dampness injures the yin. Therefore, symptoms such as headache and body heat arise from wind-warmth, as wind harms the defensive qi and dampness harms the spleen qi. Hence, with wind-warmth as the illness, both yin and yang are floating. There may be sweating, a heavy body, excessive sleepiness, and difficulty in breathing or speaking. For these above symptoms, it is inappropriate to induce purging. If large doses of poisonous medicinal pills, such as bitter almonds, are administered, and heat symptoms arise concurrently, the patient is likely to face death. For diseases caused by the second vital qi, one should use the Gui Zhi Ma Huang Decoction to induce sweating only.</p>
<p><strong>Grain Full: The Third Vital Qi</strong></p>
<p>The third vital qi causes diseases that commonly present as fevers, particularly in the channels of the lower limbs. The three yang—Taiyang, Yangming, and Shaoyang—and the three yin—Taiyin, Shaoyin, and Jueyin—are involved. Taiyang presents with fever and aversion to cold, headache and neck pain, and stiff lower back; Yangming shows body heat, eye discomfort, and dry nose with inability to lie down; Shaoyang reveals chest and side pain, deafness, bitter taste in the mouth, with alternating chills and fever accompanied by vomiting. These three yang conditions are associated with heat. Taiyin shows abdominal fullness, dry throat, warm hands and feet, normal bowel movements without thirst, or abdominal pain when full. Shaoyin presents with dryness of the mouth and tongue with thirst, and Jueyin manifests as abdominal distension, constricted feeling, breathlessness, heavy sensation in the chest, cold extremities, and bluish nails. For diseases caused by the third vital qi, one should apply cooling measures, warm the upper body, and nourish the lower body, but it is inappropriate to use purging with medicinal pills like bitter almonds.<a id="trans-431p" href="#orig-431p" class="marker">[431p]</a><br><strong>Heat of Great Summer before the Ascendance of the Four Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Four Qi are associated with illnesses that frequently arise from heat, causing headaches, body fever, thirst, and are unsuitable for treatment as hot diseases. It is advisable to use Bai Hu Decoction, as this illness is non-contagious. Subsequently, symptoms may include spleen-dampness, gastric distress, large intestinal problems, small intestinal issues, severe abdominal pain, cholera symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, dysentery with mixed red and white, inability to differentiate between food and drink, diabetes, intestinal rumbling with cutting pain, facial swelling and foot edema, jaundice, dryness of the mouth, abdominal distension, and weakness in hands and feet. Children can also present these symptoms. For illnesses of the Four Qi, it is best to promote drainage, using remedies like Wu Ling San.</p>
<p><strong>Autumn Equinox and the Ascendance of the Five Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Five Qi are linked to illnesses that commonly manifest as wheezing, vomiting, coughing, and women experiencing alternating chills and fever, along with intermittent fevers, abscesses, and skin rashes in children. For illnesses associated with the Five Qi, it is advisable to use Xiao and Da Chai Hu Decoction, focusing on treatments for both the exterior and interior.<a id="trans-432p" href="#orig-432p" class="marker">[432p]</a><br><strong>Small Snow - The Qi of Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Qi of Conclusion leads to frequent illnesses caused by wind phlegm, wind-cold, and damp obstruction, resulting in the limbs being unresponsive. As winter water increases, the water and dampness clash, leading to a decline in lung qi. The harsh winter cold intensifies the issue, causing an inability to recover and leading to weakness with impaired function, while the water and fluids remain clear and cold. In cases of severe cold illnesses, there are accumulations and masses, cold hernias, and blood stagnation. For any qi-related ailment, the diseases of the Qi of Conclusion should be treated by breaking accumulations and inducing sweat.</p>

<p><strong>Southern Politics and Northern Politics</strong></p>
<p>In Southern politics, the year is determined by the sky at the spring, observing if the ruler&#39;s fire is above or below; if above, it does not respond, if below, it does not respond. In Northern politics, if the ruler&#39;s fire is above it does not respond, if below, it does not respond, if on the left, it does not respond on the right, if on the right, it does not respond on the left. What should sink rises; what should rise sinks. In Southern politics, the previous is left and the latter is right, representing the ruler. In Northern politics, the previous is right and the latter is left, representing the ministers.<a id="trans-435p" href="#orig-435p" class="marker">[435p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Fluctuation of Qi</h3>
<p>This is a discussion of the four theories regarding the mutual existence of body and function in heaven and earth, examining the divine mechanisms of diagnosing illness. Conditions such as dampness affecting the stomach, heat in the small intestine, and wind in the gallbladder all indicate deficiency due to falling below the norm. To remedy this, one should first supplement with herbs like astragalus, ginseng, licorice, angelica, bupleurum, and cisplenus, which are warm and sweet, aiding in growth during spring and summer.</p>
<p>The spleen represents earth, the heart represents fire, and the liver represents wood, all reflecting the flourishing energy of strong fire. When there is an excess, one should drain with sweet and cold herbs like licorice and gardenia to alleviate heat, which can harm the lungs and cause reverse flow in the chest. The bitter and cold herb, huangqin, helps to reduce chest heat and alleviates breathlessness. Safflower is used to break up stagnant blood, while huangqin may greatly nourish kidney water and enhance lung energy, cooling excessive heat in the blood.</p>
<p>In conditions of cold affecting the bladder and dryness affecting the large intestine, there is often a significant excess. Here, one should drain using warm and sweet herbs like astragalus to stop spontaneous sweating, making the exterior strong against cold pathogens. The warming effects of angelica can moisten dryness, while the addition of peach kernel helps to open blocked pathways and relieve constipation.</p>
<p>The essence of kidney water and the qi of lung metal both reflect deficiency. To address this, one should initially supplement using bitter and cold herbs like berberine to eliminate damp heat associated with atrophy. This can manifest in weakened knees, and helps to alleviate symptoms of yin deficiency, sweats, and sexual dysfunction while enhancing essence. Licorice, gardenia, and huangqin can support lung qi and balance downward flow of yin fire. When the lung experiences distress from upward movement of qi, consuming bitter herbs for drainage is essential.</p>
<p>This describes the common method of treatment for heat in early summer, which is not a rigid rule. A flexible approach, based on the specific nature of the illness, is what is truly necessary.<a id="trans-436p" href="#orig-436p" class="marker">[436p]</a><br><strong>On Excess and Harm in Reception</strong></p>
<p>I read the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; regarding the subtle principles and reached the point about excess causing harm in reception. I sighed and said: &quot;Indeed, this is the pivot of creation!&quot; Wang Taifu expounded on this earlier, and Liu Hejian later elucidated it; the sages’ essence is nearly all encompassed. However, scholars still cannot fully comprehend it; isn&#39;t there still an understanding lacking? </p>
<p>Carefully, I note in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the emperor said, &quot;I wish to understand the correspondence of the geography to the six seasons, how is the Qi positioned?&quot; Qibo replied, &quot;To the right of clarity is the position of sovereign fire. To the right of sovereign fire, take a step back, and the minister fire will govern; take another step back, the earth Qi will govern; another step back, the metal Qi will govern; another step back, the water Qi will govern; another step back, the wood Qi will govern; and another step back, the sovereign fire will govern again.&quot;<a id="trans-437p" href="#orig-437p" class="marker">[437p]</a><br>Under the influence of fire, water rises; beneath the water level, earth rises; beneath the earth level, wind rises; beneath the wind level, metal rises; beneath the metal level, fire rises: under the influence of the sovereign fire, yin essence rises. The emperor asked, &quot;Why is this?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;Excess leads to harm; to support is to regulate; regulating leads to transformation. The external manifestations of prosperity and decline indicate that harm leads to disorder, and transformation leads to great illness. </p>
<p>Consider how yin and yang and the five elements interact in the universe: the high are restrained, the low are elevated; the strong are bent, the weak are supported. This occurs inevitably and cannot be otherwise. If not, the high would become higher, the low lower, the strong stronger, and the weak weaker, leading to extreme chaos in governance. Can heaven and earth maintain their positions like this? Yet, whether high or low, weak or strong, this is still an inevitable occurrence. </p>
<p>Hence, change is the essence of transformation. Because it cannot be constant, divine transformation cannot be measured; what cannot be measured is continuous; if it could be constant, it would cease.&quot;<a id="trans-438p" href="#orig-438p" class="marker">[438p]</a><br>When excessive, it harms the following, hence the control. Can one really act against this, and yet be unable to avoid it? As for the Grand Marshal and the Hejian, they have already elaborated, so I will not elaborate further here. For what has not yet been fully understood, please allow me to present it.</p>
<p>From the clearly manifest to the fifteen sentences of governance by the sovereign fire, this refers to the positions governed by the six sections. From below the mutual fire to the twelve sentences of the hidden essence of yin, this pertains to the correspondence of geography with seasonal energy. The two sentences on excessive harm and control indicate the need to restrain excess. Control leads to transformation. The four sentences regarding major transformations discuss the constants of control and the variables of lack of control.</p>
<p>&quot;Receiving&quot; is akin to &quot;following.&quot; Yet, they use the term &quot;receiving&quot; instead of &quot;following&quot; because it signifies receiving from above, hence it is called &quot;receiving.&quot; Although it is called a symbol, it contains the meaning of prevention. Excess refers to extreme overreach. Harm indicates the damage to things. Control signifies overcoming. However, what is received, if not excessive, simply follows. Thus, even though it receives without visibility, once it is excessive, it must overcome to bring balance, and in that balance, it becomes visible.<a id="trans-439p" href="#orig-439p" class="marker">[439p]</a><br>However, when one welcomes it, they do not know where it comes from; when one tracks it, they do not know where it stops. It is certain there are things that cannot be definitively known. Yet, what can be certain always exists in the obscurity and haze, and cannot be deceived by anyone. Hejian states: When the rising reaches its peak, it seems to reverse into a transformation of itself. The &quot;seeming&quot; can certainly be sought through form and substance. Therefore, in the later chapters, the organ of the yin relates to the wind&#39;s emergence, ultimately leading to austerity; the organ of the lesser yin relates to the emergence of heat, ultimately leading to categories of cold. The emergence as wind or heat corresponds to the peak (or height), while the austerity and cold correspond to control. Additionally, when water manifests as hail and snow, and earth manifests as rapid winds, the manifestation of water and earth corresponds to the peak, while hail, snow, and rapid winds correspond to control. Such occurrences are the constants of creation; they cannot exist without peaks, nor can they exist without control. Although the themes of the preceding and following chapters may differ in seasonal influences and atmospheric conditions, the peak can harm the method of control, and this applies to all matters without exception. Because this applies universally, when seeking from humanity, the five viscera mutually balance each other.<a id="trans-440p" href="#orig-440p" class="marker">[440p]</a><br>If one organ is imbalanced, it cannot maintain balance; when the five organs balance each other, is it not the case that one must guard against excess? If one organ is imbalanced, does that mean it cannot overcome balance? Speaking of heart fire, if it is not in excess, then even if kidney water fears heart fire, it merely guards against it; but if there is excess, it will rise and overcome it. The same applies to all other organs. Regulation allows transformation; one must work to regulate so that transformation occurs. This may be a misunderstanding in transmission and writing, and those who read it may unknowingly seek understanding in vain, thus omitting these four lines entirely. Little do they know that the first two lines only speak of excess causing harm and harm leading to regulation. These four lines convey meanings beyond harm and regulation. If one were to omit them, the full intent of the text would not be understood. Regulation and transformation directly contrast with the following discussion of harm leading to disorder, and both ideas are coherent. There is no need for convoluted explanation; they naturally align.<a id="trans-441p" href="#orig-441p" class="marker">[441p]</a><br>The principles of creation and transformation state that when there are regulations, the six energies are kept from becoming excessive, resulting in balance. In this balance, all things are born, giving rise to endless transformations. The abundance of transformation is such that birth precedes transformation. Externally, the phenomena of prosperity and decline indicate that the distribution of the six energies governs these cycles of rise and fall, which are distinctly observable, hence it is referred to as external manifestation. When harm leads to chaos, and the great illnesses of creation and transformation arise, it indicates that when excess harms without any regulation, it results in the disintegration and disorder of governance. When governance disintegrates and becomes chaotic, transformations reach their extremes, leading to severe calamities; can there be any beings that are not afflicted? The concept of creation and transformation pertains to everything born and transformed, wherein extreme changes lead to severe disasters, hence it is called great illness. Above, creation relates to the principles of transformation, while below, it pertains to all things. Speaking in terms of humanity, regulation leads to creation and transformation, like the original energy circulating and nourishing the entire body, with all five organs, six intestines, limbs, bones, and nine orifices relying upon it. This is regarded as the governing principle of movement and stillness.<a id="trans-442p" href="#orig-442p" class="marker">[442p]</a><br>Severe illness arises when evil spirits run rampant, depleting the righteous energy. All the five organs, six visceras, four limbs, hundreds of bones, and nine orifices can no longer function as they normally would. Some harm themselves out of self-harm, others inherit pain, or one comes into being through the absence of being, transforming what is inherently present into absence. Some regard the dual transformations as a single intent, while others use great illness as a metaphor for the essence of creation. All these notions are incorrect. Moreover, the essence of a person certainly has both exuberance and self-restraint; if it is exuberant but lacks self-control, then methods involving herbs, fluids, needles, stones, and guiding practices serve as assistance. For the energies of heaven and earth, those that are exuberant yet self-restrained return to equilibrium, while those that are exuberant without restraint—who will assist them? Nevertheless, the way of creation and transformation, when changed to the extreme, must eventually revert and restore its normal state. If scholars can comprehend the principles from those like Tai Pu and He Jian and then relate them to this discourse, it may elucidate the intricacies of the nexus of creation and transformation. Yet, Zhang Dai Ren in &quot;Essentials of Treatment&quot; states: Suppose water is the mother, and wood is the child.<a id="trans-443p" href="#orig-443p" class="marker">[443p]</a><br>When spring is in full bloom, winter&#39;s command still lingers, indicating the excess of water. When water is excessive, the wood cannot thrive. Wood is the successor to winter and draws strength from water. When water is already excessive, it harms what it supports, thus wood has no power. Without the power of wood, there can be no control over earth; when earth is strong, it dominates water. Earth is the successor to the mandate of late summer. When water is controlled by earth, heat overcomes cold. This transformation becomes humidity, which is its power. </p>
<p>Similarly, when fire is the mother and earth is the child, during late summer, warmth still prevails, indicating an excess of fire. When fire is excessively strong, humidity cannot emerge. Humidity is the successor to summer and is created by fire; if fire is excessive, it harms what it supports, and thus humidity has no power. Without the power of humidity, it cannot control water; when water is strong, fire becomes constrained. Water is the command of severe winter. When fire is controlled by water, cold conquers heat. This transforms into earth, and wet earth thus regains its power. </p>
<p>This statement, when elaborated further, strays increasingly from the classic texts. Some say that the essence of the heart is what others have achieved, and it is likely derived from misconceptions in what one has heard.<a id="trans-444p" href="#orig-444p" class="marker">[444p]</a><br><strong>On the Longevity and Shortness of Life Related to Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The Great Discussion of the Five Constants states: The essence of Yin supports the longevity of a person, while the essence of Yang leads to their early demise. The essence of Yin that supports refers to the energy of spring and summer, which is associated with growth. The essence of Yang that descends pertains to the energy of autumn and winter, which is related to storage.</p>
<p>In nature, when the hidden Yin of the heavens encounters spring, it stirs and rises above, and this is referred to as the energy of life. When it reaches its peak and floats, it is known as the energy of flourishing. These six energies migrate rightwards to the heavens, representing the clear Yang of the sky. Yang is associated with life and, therefore, longevity.</p>
<p>The primal Yang of heaven, when encountering autumn, retreats and descends, leading to the energy of collection and demise. When it sinks to its limits and becomes heavy, it is the energy of closure and preservation. This energy migrates leftwards into the earth, thus representing the turbid Yin of the ground. The act of release leads to death.</p>
<p>Outward roots are referred to as the establishment of energy; when energy ceases, transformation halts. Inward roots are called the workings of the spirit; when the spirit departs, the workings stop. Both do not rise but rather fall.</p>
<p>The energy of the earth corresponds to the human spleen and stomach. The spleen governs the energy of the five organs, while the kidneys govern their essence, both of which are offered upwards to the heavens. These two collectively govern the processes of creation, rising and floating, which indicates that spring brings forth life and summer nurtures growth, all stemming from the stomach.</p>
<p>Thus, when activities, rest, and nourishment are well-ordered, and when they are clear and pure, it is imperative not to harm the original energy of the stomach. If one descends to the consumption of the kidneys and liver, or enacts the commands of autumn and winter that lead to demise, they will align with the natural order of heaven.<a id="trans-445p" href="#orig-445p" class="marker">[445p]</a><br><strong>The Gate of Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Method of Danxi</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p>When excessive, it harms; when carried, it controls.</p>
<p>As Qi comes, if it reaches extremes and causes disaster, then to ride on this Qi, balance must be restored by reverting it. Things that reach their extremes must revert, for this is the nature of principles. Generally, the influences of cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire, as well as the forms of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, all can harm their objects when they become excessive; thus, carrying and controlling them is necessary. Therefore, when extremes lead to disasters, balance can be achieved by reverting, revealing the subtlety of the movement of Qi.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of &quot;when excessive, it harms; when carried, it controls.&quot; </p>
<p>The interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, ensures that extreme cold generates heat. Extreme heat generates cold, and spirits are unpredictable, having their roles in the control and modulation in between. Thus, when wood is at its peak, it resembles metal; when fire reaches its peak, it resembles water; when earth is at its peak, it resembles wood; when metal is at its peak, it resembles fire; and when water is at its peak, it resembles earth. The excessive nature of Qi leads its carrying to triumph over itself. Only by carrying the excessive and controlling its harm can the achievements of creation be realized.</p>
<p>Now, beneath the fire of the heart, the water energy carries it but does not transform the fire energy; beneath the water level, the earth energy carries it while the water energy does not alter (the growth of wood); beneath the earth level, wood carries it and earth follows; beneath the wind level, metal carries it and calms the wind. The heat of fire carries the dry metal, naturally causing the ailments among metal families; the essence of yin carries its sovereign fire, naturally leading to an outcome among fire families.<a id="trans-446p" href="#orig-446p" class="marker">[446p]</a><br>The so-called excess causing harm, and the receiving that leads to restraint, is just thus. I have examined the Great Treatise on the Six Origins, which states that when the Lesser Yang reaches, it is fire that generates, ultimately leading to moisture; this reflects the idea of water transforming to receive the fire of the opposite. When the Greater Yang reaches, it brings cold snow and hail, white dust, which signifies the earth transforming to receive cold water. Then comes the Great Yin, which manifests as thunder and sudden violent winds; the Absolute Yin brings forth life-creating winds, ultimately leading to desolation; the Bright Yang results in diffusion and warmth; the Lesser Yin gives rise to heat, balanced by cold. Is it not true that excess causes harm and that receiving leads to restraint? In the past, the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo explored the celestial records and the extremes of geography, gathering distant elements and observing their own bodies, questioning each other to compose the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; This culminated in the profound discussions of the Great Treatise, which articulates the interdependence of the six vital energies, indicating that restraint leads to transformation; externally, there is flourishing and decline, harm causes chaos, and transformation can lead to great ailments. All energies that dominate and come from below are diminished in their manifest power. Otherwise, when changes arise from water, hail and snow occur; from earth, sudden gusts arise; from wood, destruction emerges; from metal, clarity is revealed; from fire, obscurity sets in. These are all manifestations of extremity responding to the reception of excess. Alas! To understand the cosmic principles as a Confucianist includes the medical practitioners; it is not merely about treating illnesses. One must consider their ignorance of the principles of heaven and earth, which is insufficient for the language of a physician.<a id="trans-447p" href="#orig-447p" class="marker">[447p]</a><br>Examine the disease mechanisms without failing to consider the appropriate energies.</p>
<p>Evil energies each have their own affiliations, which must be thoroughly examined at the outset; treatment methods each have their own principles, which must be carefully observed afterwards. The essence of treating illness lies in identifying these affiliations first; if one is unaware of where the principles lead, it is easy to make mistakes. The emergence of illness is overwhelmingly numerous, but its affiliations are confined to the five phases and six energies. If one can accurately investigate this and discern the critical points, treatment can be conducted accordingly, ensuring that each method aligns with the appropriateness of the phases and energies, avoiding any minute errors. In this way, the approach to treating illness and seeking affiliations shall be without regret. The True Essentials treatise states: “Examine the disease mechanisms, without losing sight of the appropriate energies,” encapsulating this idea. It has been said that within the practice of medicine, if one word could encompass its essence, it would be &quot;energies.&quot;<a id="trans-448p" href="#orig-448p" class="marker">[448p]</a><br>Heaven is the Yang, and Earth is the Yin. The dual energies of Yin and Yang are divided into three categories, referred to as the three Yin and three Yang. However, Heaven is not purely Yang; it also contains three Yin. Likewise, Earth is not purely Yin; it also contains three Yang. Thus, above and below, Heaven and Earth each have the six elements of wind, heat, fire, moisture, dryness, and cold that circulate and move between them, along with the five movements of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water.</p>
<p>Human life is intertwined with these elements, as the organs, vital energy, and blood flow in correspondence with Heaven and Earth. This reveals the cause of many illnesses and the mechanisms involved, all of which arise from these principles. Therefore, how should a physician approach treatment? They should carefully observe this and ensure that nothing is neglected in accordance with the proper conditions before proceeding.</p>
<p>As for various illnesses: disturbances from wind dizziness are associated with the Liver Wood; all types of pain, itching, and ulcers relate to Heart Fire; swelling and fullness due to moisture pertain to Spleen Earth; emotional distress and stagnation correspond to Lung Metal; and cold that contracts and pulls relates to Kidney Water. These illnesses are attributed to the five movements.<a id="trans-449p" href="#orig-449p" class="marker">[449p]</a><br>All violent rigidity belongs to wind; all vomiting of sourness belongs to heat; all agitation and madness belong to fire; all spasms and rigidity belong to dampness; all dry and desiccated conditions belong to dryness; all diseases with clear and cool bodily fluids belong to cold. This pathology relates to the six qi. Indeed, understanding the nature of a disease is crucial; although it may seem thorough, the treatment applied must be specific. Therefore, one must clearly differentiate between yin and yang in cases of doubt, and distinguish between root and branch in subtle matters. For the differences between whether there is or isn&#39;t, one should seek the reasons for these differences; for the distinctions between fullness and emptiness, one should consider the reasons for these distinctions. Induce sweating, vomiting, or purging as warranted; use warm, cold, or cool treatments as appropriate. One may go against it to control the mild, or follow it to direct the severe.<a id="trans-450p" href="#orig-450p" class="marker">[450p]</a><br>In the higher aspects, one governs the disturbances of the vital energy from afar; in the middle aspects, one discerns the transformations of the seasonal movements; in the lower aspects, one examines the appropriateness of the north and south, ensuring that the small and great are balanced, and the order of events aligns properly, thereby achieving governance. Could there be any mistakes that are grossly different or chaotic? Furthermore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: to treat an illness, one must seek its root. The &quot;Materia Medica&quot; says: to heal an illness, one must first observe the mechanism of the disease. This is the essence of examining the disease mechanism. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Yuan&quot; states: do not lose the trust of Heaven, and do not go against the appropriate energies. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constants&quot; states: one must prioritize the seasonal energies and not disrupt the harmony of Heaven. All of this conveys the importance of maintaining proper energies. Thus, the texts of the &quot;Simple Questions&quot; and the &quot;Spirit Pivot&quot; consistently emphasize the discourse on the movements of energy. It has been said that one must first establish the year to clarify its energies, and it further advises that those who treat diseases must be clear about the laws of Heaven and the geography of the earth, as well as the interchange of Yin and Yang. It has been said that if one does not understand the seasonal changes of the years, the fluctuations of energies, and the origins of vacuity and solidity, one cannot be proficient in their craft. This is stated with repeated emphasis as if there is an inability to refrain from such a notion; could this be the private worries of the sages overemphasized? The essence of the medical path is entirely contingent upon this. By observing the &quot;Basic Patterns of Illness,&quot; one compares various physical forms and gains a profound understanding of the subtlety of the movements of energies and transformations, leaving no room for additions regarding the principles of disease mechanism and energy appropriateness.<a id="trans-451p" href="#orig-451p" class="marker">[451p]</a><br><strong>Medical Canon of the Right Transmission</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Yu Tuan of the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Excess and Its Harm</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about the meaning of &quot;excess harms and restraint pertains.&quot; It was said that Wang Andao has elaborated on this thoroughly. Yet, there are still points that need clarification, so I will briefly present them as follows. The Yellow Emperor said: “I wish to know how geography corresponds to the six seasonal phases.” Qi Bo replied: “To the right of the obvious is the position of the Fire of the Ruler. To the right of the Fire of the Ruler, one step back, is governed by the Fire of the Minister; another step back, is governed by the Earth Qi; another step back, is governed by the Metal Qi; another step back, is governed by the Water Qi; another step back, is governed by the Wood Qi; and another step back, returns to the governance of the Fire of the Ruler. Below the Fire of the Minister, the Water Qi supports it; beneath the Water position, the Earth’s Yang supports it; beneath the Earth position, the Wind Qi supports it; beneath the Wind position, the Metal Qi supports it; beneath the Metal position, the Fire Qi supports it; and beneath the Fire of the Ruler, the Yin Essence supports it. Excess causes harm; restraint pertains to governance, and governance leads to transformation. Externally, the cycles of flourishing and decline can lead to harm, chaos, and the manifestation of serious illnesses.<a id="trans-452p" href="#orig-452p" class="marker">[452p]</a><br>The Five Elements consist of Wood, Earth, Metal, Water, each represented once, while Fire has two forms: the Ruler Fire and the Minister Fire. Geographically, they are distributed across the six directions, and seasonally, they correspond to the six Qi. </p>
<p>The first Qi goes from the Chou (Ox) to the Mao (Rabbit), starting from the Major Cold and ending at the Spring Equinox, governed by the Jueyin Wind Wood. The second Qi extends from the Mao to the Si (Snake), beginning at the Spring Equinox and concluding at the Lesser Fullness, overseen by the Shaoyin Ruler Fire. The third Qi spans from the Si to the Wei (Goat), commencing at the Lesser Fullness and finishing at the Major Heat, controlled by the Shaoyang Minister Fire. The fourth Qi covers the period from the Wei to the You (Rooster), starting at the Major Heat and ending at the Autumn Equinox, presided over by the Taiyin Moist Earth. The fifth Qi goes from the You to the Hai (Pig), beginning at the Autumn Equinox and concluding at the Lesser Snow, managed by the Yangming Dry Metal. The final Qi runs from the Hai to the Chou, starting from the Lesser Snow and ending at the Major Cold, ruled by the Taiyang Cold Water.</p>
<p>What is referred to as &quot;manifest&quot; pertains to direction, with the sun rising in the direction of Mao. The Shaoyin Ruler Fire begins here and moves to the right, hence it is said to be &quot;manifest to the right.&quot;<a id="trans-453p" href="#orig-453p" class="marker">[453p]</a><br>The heavens and the earth rotate to the left, while the six energies rotate to the right. Thus, it is said to retreat. Below the six positions, each has something it cannot overcome, which it supports from below. The Wang family says: &quot;To support is like to follow, but it also has the meaning of hindrance.&quot; Therefore, what is offered below is called support. As for the Way of the five elements, if there is no excess, it merely follows; if there is any excess, it rises to overcome. Some say: &quot;What does the regulator regulate?&quot; &quot;What does the harmful one harm?&quot; It is said: &quot;The regulator regulates the excessive energy; the harmful one harms the original energy of the supporter.&quot; What is called original energy, in general, is referred to as the One; when divided, it is called the six. The One is that from the One Heaven comes Water, Water produces Wood, Wood produces Fire, Fire produces Earth, Earth produces Metal, and Metal again produces Water, circulating without end, generating endlessly.<a id="trans-454p" href="#orig-454p" class="marker">[454p]</a><br>The six elements are as follows: water is the source of the transformation of wood, wood is the source of the transformation of fire, fire is the source of the transformation of earth, earth is the source of the transformation of metal, and metal is the source of the transformation of water. This cycle of transformation is boundless. If fire is not excessive, then the accompanying water simply follows. When there is excessive heat, the water rises to balance it, as it fears harming the essence of metal. This principle applies to all six energies. </p>
<p>The concept of the Five Elements’ cycles of dominance and recovery emerges organically and unexpectedly. When there is regulation, there is transformation. The principle states that when there is regulation, it is like heat being managed, leading to continuous transformation—what harm can there be? The external manifestations of prosperity and decline indicate that what is supported is weak, while what is excessive is at its peak, yet the regulation does not cease. In the heavens and earth, these are the six harms; in the human body, they manifest as six ailments. Harm arises from disorder, meaning there is transformation without regulation. What is supported becomes extremely weak and devoid of energy, thus what is excessive becomes rampant and uncontainable. In the heavens and earth, this leads to great destruction; in the human body, it results in serious illness and potentially death. </p>
<p>This is a general overview, not exhaustive in detail. Scholars should refer to the discussions of An Dao for a complete understanding of these concepts.<a id="trans-455p" href="#orig-455p" class="marker">[455p]</a><br>The Evils of the Six Excesses</p>
<p>Someone asked about the evils of the six excesses, and it should be understood as the extremes of the six energies from the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; In the past, the physician He responded to Duke Ping of Jin, not mentioning wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, but referred instead to yin and yang, wind and rain, clarity and obscurity. Why is this? He replied: Although the terms differ, the underlying principles are the same. What is meant by yin excess leading to cold diseases is that the excessive command of the taiyang (greater yang) and cold water leads to cold diseases; yin excess leading to heat diseases refers to the excessive command of the shaoyang (lesser yang) with its fire resulting in heat diseases; wind excess leading to endpoint diseases means an excess in the jueyin (terminal yin) and windy wood results in endpoint diseases; rain excess leading to abdominal diseases is due to the excessive command of the taiyin (greater yin) and damp earth resulting in abdominal diseases; obscurity excess leading to confusion diseases comes from the excessive command of the yangming (brightness) and dry metal leading to epidemic diseases; and clarity excess leading to heart diseases is caused by the excessive command of the shaoyin (lesser yin) and ministerial fire resulting in heart diseases. Someone said: Yin and yang, wind and rain, can be equated with the ailments of cold, heat, wind, and dampness; they clearly correspond with each other. However, the conditions of obscurity excess leading to confusion diseases and clarity excess leading to heart diseases seem not to correspond; please clarify this for me.<a id="trans-456p" href="#orig-456p" class="marker">[456p]</a><br>It is said: When gold is excessive in a year, dryness causes great upheaval; long periods of clear skies without rain result in yellow dust obscuring the heavens, and the sun and moon lose their brightness. This should be regarded as a pestilential disease, the miasma of mountains and hills. The confusion appears to indicate a pestilence, understood as a transmission error. When the fire of the sovereign is excessive, heat advances prematurely; fire symbolizes brightness, thus it is said to be &quot;lewd brightness,&quot; as stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that when the sky is bright, the sun and moon do not shine clearly. The lesser yin sovereign fire governs, hence it is called heart disease. The spring equinox arrives and great heat occurs at the beginning of summer. Some interpret brightness as daylight and darkness as night, while confusion is seen as misleading the heart and will, which is incorrect. Daylight and darkness are merely the natural laws of heaven; how can there be lewdness in that? What is called misleading the heart and will is also not the lewdness or evil of heaven and earth. Scholars ought to reflect further on this. In ancient times, sages looked up to examine celestial phenomena and looked down to observe geographical features, correlating the ten stems to create the five movements, and associating the twelve branches to form the six qi. Heaven embodies the six directions, and the year is marked by the six qi across the five elements. By adding the six qi of heaven to the six divisions of the year&#39;s five movements, one can discern the principles of gain and loss, which are universally valid. As the tradition states, the height of heaven and the distance of the stars, if one seeks their meanings, one could thus attain understanding even after a thousand years.<a id="trans-457p" href="#orig-457p" class="marker">[457p]</a><br><strong>Medical Outline</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty – Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exegesis on the Great Treatise of Temporal Origins and the Principle of Qi</strong></p>
<p>According to the Great Treatise on Temporal Origins, the heavens have five elements and regularities, which pertain to the beginnings of the discussion on the five movements and six qi, marking the start of the changes between abundance and deficiency. The five movements refer to the wood, fire, earth, metal, and water of the earth, governing the internal aspects of governance. The three yin and three yang refer to the wind, heat, humidity, dryness, and cold of the heavens, governing the external aspects of governance. When the Emperor asked about the interaction of the five movements in governance and how it corresponds with the external treatment of the three yin and three yang, Gui Yu responded that the governance of the five movements and the yin-yang is the way of heaven and earth, the guiding principle of all things, the parents of change, and the source of life and death, the abode of the divine. Thus, in governance, what is born is called transformation, what is extreme is called change, the unknowable nature of yin and yang is referred to as the divine, and the use of the divine without boundaries is called sage-like. Their transformations, divine and sacred, are called function; in the heavens, this corresponds to the qi of wind, heat, humidity, dryness, and cold (the three yin and three yang); on the earth, the qi of wind corresponds to wood, heat corresponds to fire, humidity corresponds to earth, dryness corresponds to metal, and cold corresponds to water, thus forming the shapes of the five movements. Therefore, the forms in heaven resonate with those on earth, allowing all things to thrive—this is the transformation of life. Yet, heaven and earth are the up and down of all things, the left and right of yin and yang, represented by the external qi of the three yin and three yang, rotating to the right to influence the earth. Water and fire signify the manifestations of yin and yang, while metal and wood represent the beginning and end of generation; this is the shape of the five movements in the earth, turning left to align with the heavens.<a id="trans-458p" href="#orig-458p" class="marker">[458p]</a><br>The amount of energy in the heavens corresponds to the rise and fall of forms on the earth. Thus, the quantity of energy in the heavens interacts with the rising and falling forms on the earth, leading to the changes manifested in all things. When the energy is abundant and coincides with the flourishing forms, it brings increase, resulting in thriving changes; when the energy is scarce and coincides with the declining forms, it leads to decrease, resulting in diminished changes. </p>
<p>The transformation of living things arises from the constant energy of heaven and earth, known as &quot;normal energy&quot; in the five phases and &quot;consistent transformation&quot; in the six energies. The extreme changes of things refer to the changing energies of heaven and earth, termed &quot;excess and deficiency&quot; in the five phases and &quot;excessive dominance and reversals&quot; in the six energies. The predominance of changes is characterized by excessive conditions in the five phases and excessive dominance in the six energies, while the diminishment of changes arises from deficiencies in the five phases and reversals in the six energies. </p>
<p>All discussions about the five phases and six energies relate to their transformations of abundance and scarcity. This topic, explored thoroughly in the latter part of the classic texts, encompasses countless words aiming to thoroughly elucidate these four concepts, which scholars should study diligently. </p>
<p>The movements of the five phases each have their designated periods and are not limited to just the main seasonal times, referring to wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The governance of each phase concludes its yearly cycle and is not confined merely to the seasonal timing within a year. Previous sections discuss the five phases without addressing the six energies, focusing on the main seasonal times without considering the yearly governance. This section begins the discussion of how the five phases and six energies interact and govern together, extending beyond only the five phases; it subsequently explores how each phase governs its respective year, extending beyond just the main seasonal times.<a id="trans-459p" href="#orig-459p" class="marker">[459p]</a><br><strong>On the Great Discussion of the Five Movements and the Transformations of Qi</strong></p>
<p>According to the Great Discussion of the Five Movements, the Yellow Emperor sat in the Hall of Brightness to express his desire to understand their origins. He then discussed the meanings of Yin and Yang derived from the previous text on the Five Movements and Six Qi. This discussion encompasses the symbols of the Five Heavens, wherein the constellations traversed represent the transformations of Qi, corresponding to the same categories of the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches, along with those that are linked in position, resulting in harmonious transformations.</p>
<p>The Earth governs the first (Jia) and sixth (Ji) stems and corresponds to the Ox (Chou) and Goat (Wei) branches. The Moon governs these as the energy of the dark heavens, traversing the symbol of the heart and the tail represented by Ji (the sixth stem) and the middle palace. Therefore, Jia and Chou share a position, while Ji and Wei belong to the same category, leading to the transformation of moist Earth.</p>
<p>Metal governs the second (Yi) and seventh (Geng) stems and relates to the Rabbit (Yin) and Rooster (You) branches. The Yangming governs these as the energy of the pure heavens, traversing the symbols of the stars Kang (Kang), Zhi (Zhi), Ma (Mao), and Bi (Bi). Thus, Yi and Yin correspond to the same category, while Geng and You do as well, leading to the transformation of dry Metal.<a id="trans-460p" href="#orig-460p" class="marker">[460p]</a><br>Water governs the substances of Bing and Xin, as well as those of Chen and Xu. The Sun is its master; the primordial energy of Heaven flows through the symbols of Zhang Yi and Lou Wei. Zhang Yi corresponds to the substance of Bing and Lou Wei to Xin, hence Bing and Chen are linked, and Xin and Xu are connected, harmonizing to transform into cold water.</p>
<p>Wood governs the substances of Ding and Ren, as well as those of Si and Hai. The Jue Yin is its master; the celestial energy flows through the symbols of Wei Shi and Liu Gui. Wei Shi corresponds to the substance of Ren, and Liu Gui to Ding, thus Ren and Hai belong together, and Ding and Si belong together, harmonizing to transform into the winds of wood.</p>
<p>Fire controls the substances of Wu and Gui, as well as those of Zi and Wu. The Shao Yin is its master, and above Chen and Shen, the Shao Yang dominates; the energy of Dan Tian flows through the symbols of Niu Nu and Wu Fen. Niu Nu corresponds to the substance of Gui, and Wu Fen to the center, thus Gui and Zi are linked, and Wu and Wu are connected, harmonizing to transform into heat and fire.</p>
<p>The stems Ji and Yi belong to wood, positioned in the East; Bing and Ding belong to fire, positioned in the South; Geng and Xin belong to metal, positioned in the West; Ren and Gui belong to water, positioned in the North; Xu and Ji belong to earth, positioned in the central palace. The branches Ying and Mao match with Ji and Yi, Si and Wu match with Bing and Ding, Shen and You match with Geng and Xin, and Hai and Zi align with Ren and Gui.<a id="trans-461p" href="#orig-461p" class="marker">[461p]</a><br>The eastern position is in the direction of the dragon, the southwestern position is in the direction of the goat, the northwestern position is in the direction of the dog, and the northeastern position is in the direction of the ox, which makes up the four directions. In combination with the earth (Wu and Ji), the wood (Jia and Yi in Yin and Mao) comes together, the fire (Bing and Ding in Si and Wu) comes together, the earth (Wu and Ji in Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei) comes together, the metal (Geng and Xin in Shen and You) comes together, and the water (Ren and Gui in Hai and Zi) comes together as well. The Jia in Yin is at the head of the east, while Gui in Chou is at the tail of the north, and Jia and Chou are connected, as are Gui and Yin. Bing is at the head of the south, and Chen is at the tail of the east, thus Bing and Chen are connected. Wu and Ji are located in the middle of wood, fire, metal, and water, serving as gateways between heaven and earth, and marking the long summer in the four seasons; they connect with Wu to the south and Shen to the west, thereby Wu and Ji are not assigned a specific direction. However, the texts distinctly mention Wu divided from Ji to represent their distinction. Xin and Xu are both at the tail of the west, and Xin and Xu are connected. Only Wu fire connects with Shen.<a id="trans-462p" href="#orig-462p" class="marker">[462p]</a><br>The unrefined earth is nestled within, with Gui water connected to Yin. The earth in the center of Chou is moist, indicating that wet earth is present, with water and fire circulating in between. In the heavens, it resides before the earth, while in the ground, it resides behind the earth, leading to a constant mixture of earth and fire. Thus, earth thrives during the hot summer. Danxi deeply understood this principle and elucidated that the combination of dampness and heat often leads to illness, with eight or nine out of ten cases involving dampness generating heat, and prolonged heat giving rise to dampness. According to the celestial patterns, the stars traversing their territories primarily belong to the positions of the five movements, not extending to the positions of the six energies. This is because the stem relates to the roots of wood, while the branches and leaves correspond to the supports; therefore, when mentioning stems, the supports are included. Thus, transformations are of the same nature as both stems and supports, signifying a blend of roots and branches. Some say in recent times that only the transformations from the five movements should be considered for the celestial patterns, neglecting the transformations of the six energies. Instead, they assert the standing transformations: earth transforms properly at Wei, counter-transforms at Chou; metal properly at You, counter at Mao; water properly at Xu, counter at Chen; wood properly at Hai, counter at Si; true fire properly at Wu, counter at Zi; and mutual fire properly at Yin, counter at Shen.<a id="trans-463p" href="#orig-463p" class="marker">[463p]</a><br>The essence of the transformation of the five movements lies in the authentic and true nature of the principles of the universe, which cannot be surpassed or replicated; while the transformations represented by the opposing forces are illusory and can be outdone. The scriptures you interpret relate solely to the changes of these transformations. They are derived from the energies of the five celestial bodies. How then does this differ from what was previously stated? The response is: the meaning of the scripture is as clear as the sun and stars; those who seek understanding should excavate the meanings of the authentic and opposing transformations. Upon careful examination of the texts, the Emperor clearly outlines the celestial stems of the five movements and the branches of the six energies, posing questions collectively—not solely inquiring about the five movements without regard to the six energies. The answer given by Qibo also encompasses the representations of the five celestial bodies and their bearing on celestial stars, thus addressing both the five movements and the six energies together, not just focusing on the five movements alone and excluding the six branches. Why then, is there a failure to delve into the essential meanings of the scripture, leading to an arbitrary division of the movements and energies into two separate concepts? This results in confusion in understanding the sacred texts and misleads subsequent learners, committing the grave error of creating discord and deviation.<a id="trans-464p" href="#orig-464p" class="marker">[464p]</a><br>As for the theory of victory and defeat, the classics only discuss the six years of Zi, Wu, Yin, Shen, Chen, and Xu. The great transformation of Qi emphasizes that there is no victory or defeat in the primordial state. It is not heard that the lesser transformations of Qi in Wei, You, Hai are real; without victory or defeat, in the cycles of Chou, Wei, Mao, You, Si, and Hai, the transformations of Qi are less, yet there is victory and defeat. It has not been heard that there are great transformations of Qi during Zi, Chen, and Shen that are false, yet there is victory and defeat.</p>
<p>Now, the heavens and the earth represent the upper and lower aspects of all things, and the left and right denote the pathways of Yin and Yang. As for the year, what is the season? It discusses the rightward rotation of heaven outside, with the cold and heat entering six times to elevate the earth. The earth receives the six entries from heaven to facilitate the leftward rotation of the five elements, which give rise to people and things in the midst of heaven. The upper and lower aspects of all things, as well as the left and right pathways of Yin and Yang, correspond to the rightward rotational positions of the six seasons. </p>
<p>The upper and lower refer to what is above, which is the position governed by heaven, and what is below, which is the position by the spring. The left and right refer to what is beside the upper; they are the left and right aspects of heaven, and what is beside the lower; these are the left leisure and right positions by the spring. Thus, the three Yin and three Yang of heaven rotate rightward in their six positions, as seen during the years of Si and Hai, where Jue Yin appears above, while Shao Yin is to the left, and Tai Yang is to the right.<a id="trans-465p" href="#orig-465p" class="marker">[465p]</a><br>As for the positions of the Yin and Yang at the time of the Child and Noon years, when the Jueyin descends in a rightward spiral, above it is the Shaoyin, while to the left is the Taiyin and to the right is the Jueyin; this is how it constantly spirals downwards to the right each year. Facing north, its position is determined; what it observes, refers to the position of the heavenly authority, which is in the south while facing north. Its left and right are designated as follows: southwest is the left position, southeast is the right position, referring to the Yin and Yang that are seen. When Jueyin is above, Shaoyang is below, with the left position being Yangming and the right position being Taiyin. When Jueyin spirals downwards to the right and Shaoyin is above, Yangming is below, with the left position being Taiyang and the right position being Shaoyang. This rotation aligns with the heavenly authority. Facing south, its position is determined; what it observes, refers to the position of the earth, which is in the north while facing south. Its left and right are designated as follows: northeast is the left position, northwest is the right position, referring to the Yin and Yang that are seen. From the heights and depths of all things in heaven and earth, this discussion focuses solely on the heavenly rightward-spiraling energy.<a id="trans-466p" href="#orig-466p" class="marker">[466p]</a><br>The upper and lower realms encounter each other, and cold and heat come close together; when the qi interacts harmoniously, there is balance, but when it does not, there is illness. This refers to the celestial forces circling the geographical locations, where the qi of the heavens and the qi of the earth encounter each other. When similar types of qi meet, they promote harmony; when different types meet, they lead to illness. Even when the qi is of the same type, if they meet improperly—for example, when the ministerial fire confronts the sovereign fire—there is also illness due to improper positioning. </p>
<p>The text later states that when the minister is in the position of the sovereign, it is harmony; when the sovereign is in the position of the minister, it is discord. Discord brings about illnesses that strike swiftly and closely. What is the relationship between movement and stillness? The Emperor states that heaven moves and can approach the earth, while the earth is still and cannot approach heaven, creating difficulties in the interplay of cold and heat. </p>
<p>Qi Bo replies that the rightward movement is the upper, while the leftward movement is the lower, indicating that heaven is always above, descending from the southeast, and circling back to approach the earth. The earth, remaining below, rises from the northeast and follows the positions of wood, earth, metal, and water in their clear logic, cycling to approach heaven while all things move downward. Thus, the left and right movements interact, each encompassing the cycle of heaven, and when patterns exceed, they reciprocally converge. </p>
<p>However, the rightward movement of heaven corresponds to the rightward movements attributed to calendars and realities, yet all function similarly to the leftward movements of the earth which rise in the east and descend in the west. The earth responds through stillness, and this indicates the challenges relating to the leftward perspective that the Emperor addresses.<a id="trans-467p" href="#orig-467p" class="marker">[467p]</a><br>Qibo replied regarding the nature of heaven and earth. Although movement and stillness are different, their utility and transformation manifest: on earth, the five elements flourish and generate forms that operate internally; in the heavens, the seven celestial bodies weave through the void and align with the vital energies of heaven, moving externally. The forms and vital energies follow each other in motion, akin to the relationship between roots and branches, unified in essence and not distinct. Therefore, by merely observing the appearance of the seven celestial bodies, even from afar, their movements can be understood. </p>
<p>From the mutual interactions of above and below, this discourse pertains to the clockwise motion of heaven and the counterclockwise motion of earth. As for whether earth is below, the Emperor states that the celestial phenomena revolve while turning below the earth, and since earth occupies the upper position, the current view of &#39;below&#39; is affirmed. If the leftward motion is regarded as the downward movement of earth, can it not also be considered as below? Qibo clarifies that earth is beneath humans, situated within the vast emptiness, thus revealing the meaning of up and down. </p>
<p>In terms of their respective domains, the director of heaven, associated with the vital energy of springs, is considered above, while the five elements associated with earth are deemed below.<a id="trans-468p" href="#orig-468p" class="marker">[468p]</a><br>According to its position, the one who governs heaven is above, while the one at the spring is below, and the five elements of the earth are in the middle. Qi Bo speaks according to his association, hence he says that the lower one moves to the left. The emperor speaks according to the position, so it is difficult to say that the left movement of the earth is not downward. The term &quot;Feng&quot; means to attach. The earth is situated in the great void; where does it attach and not fall? It is supported by the great atmosphere. This refers to the six seasons of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, as the great atmosphere rotates externally, allowing the earth to hold and influence its dry, moist, and solid states to interpenetrate its body. Thus, as it enters, cold and wind are below, with wind in the east and cold in the north; dryness and heat are above, with dryness in the west and heat in the south; humidity is in the middle, centered. Before fire enters, it is above the humidity; after it enters, it is below the humidity, moving up and down between them. The essence of the earth as lower continues from this point, originating from the heavens. &quot;Hao&quot; refers to the examination and observation. It discusses the atmospheric energies of heaven and earth, as well as the process of victory and recovery, which coordinates six positions, making it challenging to diagnose. We can only inquire about the energy favoring one position, thus allowing us to follow its location and expect it in the range of inches left and right.<a id="trans-469p" href="#orig-469p" class="marker">[469p]</a><br>In terms of the laws of periods, where yang is located, its pulse responds; where yin is located, its pulse does not respond. Therefore, in the year of northern governance, the people&#39;s energy faces north, with the inch to the north and the foot to the south. The energy on the left side of the earth is on the right inch, and the energy on the right side is on the left inch. The energy on the left side of heaven is on the left foot, and the energy on the right side is on the right foot. Thus, when Shao Yin is at the spring, the left is Tai Yin and the right is Jue Yin, and both inches do not respond. When Jue Yin is at the spring, the left is Shao Yin, and the right inch does not respond. When Tai Yin is at the spring, the right is Shao Yin, and the left inch does not respond. When Shao Yin governs the heavens, the left is Tai Yin, the right is Jue Yin, and both feet do not respond. When Jue Yin governs the heavens, the left is Shao Yin, and the left foot does not respond. When Tai Yin governs the heavens, the right is Shao Yin, and the right foot does not respond either. In the year of southern governance, the people&#39;s energy faces south, with the inch to the south and the foot to the north. The energy on the left side of heaven is on the right inch, and the energy on the right side is on the left inch. The energy on the left side of the earth is on the left foot, and the energy on the right side is on the right foot. Therefore, when Shao Yin governs the heavens, the left is Tai Yin, the right is Jue Yin, and both inches do not respond.<a id="trans-470p" href="#orig-470p" class="marker">[470p]</a><br>When Jueyin governs the heavens, then Shaoyin is to the left and does not correspond on the right. When Taiyin governs the heavens, then Shaoyin is to the right and does not correspond on the left. When Shaoyin is at the spring, then Taiyin is on the left, Jueyin is on the right, and neither corresponds at both feet. When Jueyin is at the spring, then Shaoyin is on the left, and the left foot does not correspond. When Taiyin is at the spring, then Shaoyin is on the right, and the right foot does not correspond. Following its energy, those in harmony find yin and yang correspond to their respective foot positions. Against its energy, there are illnesses, wherein yin and yang may not correspond to their positions, or may alternate positions, or may lose their positions, or have feet reversed, or yin and yang may intersect. Not corresponding to their positions means that yin and yang do not align correctly with their requisite foot positions. Alternating positions means that both yin and yang have shifted one position. For example, if in the southern governance, Shaoyin governs the heavens, then yin is all at the foot, and yang is all at the position. If all shift left, yin moves left and does not correspond on the left, and yang moves right and corresponds on the right. If all shift right, yin moves right and does not correspond on the right, and yang moves left and corresponds on the left, and so forth. Losing their positions means that both the original and alternate positions have lost their correspondence and are not apparent.<a id="trans-471p" href="#orig-471p" class="marker">[471p]</a><br>If the yin is lost in governance, then both the inch and the foot lose their yin; if the yang is lost in governance, then both the inch and the foot lose their yang. It is not like moving in succession to be opposite and intersecting in other positions. The reversal of the inch and the foot refers to a situation where, under the governance of slight yin in the north, yang is at the inch and yin is at the foot, yet yang is perceived at the foot while yin is perceived at the inch. The intersection of yin and yang describes a situation where, under the governance of slight yin in the north, yang is on the left and yin is on the right, but yang is perceived on the right while yin is perceived on the left.</p>
<p>As for cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire, how do they interact with humans? In relation to all things, how does life and transformation occur? This pertains to the great rotating atmosphere outside of heaven, which enters the earth, giving life and transformation to beings. How does this affect the human organs and form, and how does it relate to the life and transformation of all things?</p>
<p>The wind that arises in the east is the wind from the great atmosphere, residing in the eastern part of the earth, and is the beginning of generation. From the wind, trees, sourness, liver, tendons, and heart are generated. All things relating to the nature, use, virtue, transformation, and governance of the east are fundamentally based on the wind, which corresponds to the liver energy within humans.<a id="trans-472p" href="#orig-472p" class="marker">[472p]</a><br>Therefore, the liver resides on the left, symbolizing the emergence of wind from the east, with tendons representing its bending and stretching, resembling the movement of the wind. The southern region generates heat, being the source of the six seasonal heats from heaven located in the south, at the center of the earth, indicative of the beginning of growth. From this heat arises bitterness in the heart, blood, and spleen. All things in the southern nature, such as virtue, transformative governance, and edicts, derive from heat, resonating with the human spirit and emotions. Therefore, the heart is situated at the front, symbolizing the heat that arises in the south, while blood represents the spirit of humanity, likening to the brilliance of fire. </p>
<p>The central region produces earth; the six seasonal dampness from heaven is present in the center of the earth, marking the commencement of transformation. From this dampness arises sweetness in the spleen, flesh, and lungs. All things in the central nature, such as virtue, transformative governance, and edicts, stem from dampness, resonating with the human spleen energy. Therefore, the spleen is located in the abdomen, symbolizing the dampness that arises from the center, while flesh fills the body, likening to the fullness of the vast earth.</p>
<p>The western region generates dryness; the six seasonal dryness from heaven resides in the west, central to the earth, marking the start of harvest. From this dryness arises metal, bitterness, lungs, skin, and kidneys. All things in the western nature, such as virtue, transformative governance, and edicts, emerge from dryness, resonating with the human lung energy.<a id="trans-473p" href="#orig-473p" class="marker">[473p]</a><br>Therefore, the lungs are located on the right, and dryness originates in the west. The skin and hair are dry on the body, reflecting the dryness of the superficial qi. The cold that arises from the north has six entrances; cold resides within the northern earth, marking the beginning of concealed growth, producing ice and affecting the kidneys, bones, and liver. All aspects of northern nature, including virtues and governance, are based on cold, which internally aligns with the essence of the kidneys in people. Thus, the kidneys are positioned at the back, symbolizing the cold that arises in the north. Bones represent the hundred body parts and symbolize the hardness of cold. The five qi stand separately, each with its precedence; if not positioned rightly, they become disruptive, while if in their rightful place, they are right. This refers to the qi of the five directions, each governing a specific set of regulations. The five qi are established, and their regulations have their own priorities. What prevails is that the rise of wind is not the spring regulation, heat is not the summer regulation, dampness is not the long summer regulation, dryness is not the autumn regulation, and cold is not the winter regulation; all of these are considerations that become disruptive when not in their rightful position.<a id="trans-474p" href="#orig-474p" class="marker">[474p]</a><br>Wind arises in spring, heat arises in summer, humidity arises in the late summer, dryness arises in autumn, and cold arises in winter; these are the rightful expressions of seasonal energy. When the elements are in harmony, disturbances are minor; when they are not in harmony, disturbances are severe. This means that when disturbances arise that are not in accordance with the proper seasonal alignments, their negative effects are exacerbated. The primary energies also refer to the atmospheres of the five directions, each governing the affairs of the year. When the energy of the year is abundant, it overcomes that which it can control and dominates that which it cannot. For example, if the energy of wood governing the year is excessive, it will check the energy of earth, reducing humidity, while it will dominate the energy of metal, resulting in strong winds. Conversely, if the energy is insufficient, it will be dominated and overwhelmed by that which it cannot control, while lightly dominating what it can. If the wood energy is insufficient, the metal energy will take control and dominate, leading to dryness, while the earth energy remains weak and is overwhelmed, resulting in an increase in humidity. Those who are dominated are affected by disturbances; if one is subdued and subjected to disturbances, the weak will not fear. If metal subdues wood and is then overwhelmed, wood&#39;s offspring, fire, will retaliate against its oppressor, and metal will then also be overwhelmed. If metal is overwhelmed by disturbances, the insufficient wood will be weak and will not resist, while the energy will rebound. How does the energy from heaven and earth reach this point? The essence of human energy originates from heaven.<a id="trans-475p" href="#orig-475p" class="marker">[475p]</a><br>The Great Treatise on the Principles of the Six Subtleties and the Changes of Luck</p>
<p>According to the Great Treatise on the Principles of the Six Subtleties, the Way of Heaven is like welcoming floating clouds; when one gazes into the deep abyss, the abyss can still be measured, but the limits of floating clouds remain unknown. Therefore, I will speak of its responsiveness to the seasons, discussing the yin and yang of Heaven, following the regularities of the celestial way. What is called &quot;above&quot; refers to those who move to the right. The rhythms of the heavenly way are divided into six sectors, with the cycles of prosperity and decline—three yin and three yang of Heaven—as they spiral outward. Each year experiences a cycle of prosperity and decline, and after six years, the complete cycle of six sectors is attained. </p>
<p>There are positions above and below, and there are records left and right, which indicate the positions of the flourishing and declining yin and yang each year. The &quot;above and below&quot; refer to the positions of the celestial overseer in the two springs. The &quot;left and right&quot; refer to the left and right realms of the celestial overseer, as well as the left and right realms of the springs, forming the four records. In general, for the yin and yang that spiral rightward in the heavens, those who preside over the positions of the celestial overseer witness the prosperity of heavenly governance when the three energies begin to manifest. Those positioned in the springs see the prosperity of the earthly energies when the final energies begin to manifest. Thus, within the upper and lower two positions, there are two sections of the flourishing and declining yin and yang.<a id="trans-476p" href="#orig-476p" class="marker">[476p]</a><br>The left side of the Heavenly Scribe is characterized by a strong presence of the Four Energies. The right side, however, is marked by a strong presence of the Two Energies. The left side of the Fountain, on the other hand, has a strong presence of the Initial Energy, while the right side also has a strong presence of the Two Energies. Thus, throughout the left and right sides, there are four cycles of Yin and Yang that demonstrate their rise and decline. Therefore, these six seasonal changes of Yin and Yang each experience a rise and fall annually, leading to a total of six. </p>
<p>In the Year of Geng Shen, the Lesser Yang comes to oversee the heavens, initiating the first cycle; on the right side of the Lesser Yang, in the Years of Mao and You, the Greater Yang comes to oversee the heavens, initiating the sixth cycle; on the right side of the Greater Yang, in the Years of Chen and Xu, the Sun comes to oversee the heavens, initiating the seventh cycle; on the right side of the Sun, in the Years of Si and Hai, the Absolute Yin comes to oversee the heavens, initiating the eighth cycle; on the right side of the Absolute Yin, in the Years of Zi and Wu, the Lesser Yin comes to oversee the heavens, initiating the ninth cycle; on the right side of the Lesser Yin, in the Years of Chou and Wei, the Greater Yin comes to oversee the heavens, initiating the tenth cycle. </p>
<p>The cycle is continuous, returning to the Lesser Yang. Thus, it is said that the sixth cycle of rise and decline of the energies exists. All these three Yin and three Yang energies are what we refer to as the markers of the Six Energies.<a id="trans-477p" href="#orig-477p" class="marker">[477p]</a><br>Those who face south and wait for it, as indicated by the right of the lesser yang before the bright, all stand facing south and await, thereby residing to the right in the west, passing through the east in a circular manner. Above the lesser yang, the fire energy governs; in the middle appears the jueyin. Above the yangming, the dry energy governs; in the middle appears the taiyin. Above the taiyang, the cold energy governs; in the middle appears the shaoyin. Above the jueyin, the wind energy governs; in the middle appears the lesser yang. Above the lesser yin, the heat energy governs; in the middle appears the taiyang. Above the taiyin, the moisture energy governs; in the middle appears the yangming. The fire, dryness, wind, cold, heat, and moisture are the governing energies—these are what is referred to as the essence of the six energies. The energies seen in the middle refer to the central energies of the six. If we speak of the prior six energies in terms of their signs, the essence is at the top, the signs are at the bottom, and the central energies are in between the essence and the signs. Thus it is said to be beneath the essence, with manifestations beneath that and the signs of energies following. The central energy, consisting of three yin and three yang, corresponds to the harmonious coupling of couples, and the organs, bowels, and meridians of a person all respond to this.<a id="trans-478p" href="#orig-478p" class="marker">[478p]</a><br>Therefore, in the concept of Shao Yang, within it is found Jue Yin, and in the concept of Jue Yin, within it is found Shao Yang. They mutually safeguard each other as the central qi. Thus, in humans, the Gallbladder and San Jiao channels of Shao Yang also connect with the Liver and Pericardium, while the Liver and Pericardium channels of Jue Yin also connect with the Gallbladder and San Jiao, creating mutual interactions. </p>
<p>In the concept of Yang Ming, within it is found Tai Yin, and in the concept of Tai Yin, within it is found Yang Ming. They mutually safeguard each other as the central qi. Thus, in humans, the Stomach and Large Intestine channels of Yang Ming also connect with the Spleen and Lungs, while the Spleen and Lung channels of Tai Yin also connect with the Stomach and Large Intestine, creating mutual interactions.</p>
<p>In the concept of Tai Yang, within it is found Shao Yin, and in the concept of Shao Yin, within it is found Tai Yang. They mutually safeguard each other as the central qi. Thus, in humans, the Bladder and Small Intestine channels of Tai Yang also connect with the Kidney and Heart, while the Kidney and Heart channels of Shao Yin also connect with the Bladder and Small Intestine, creating mutual interactions. </p>
<p>For different manifestations of distinct qi, this refers to the two energies of Tai Yang and Shao Yin. Above Tai Yang, cold qi is controlled, leading to the manifestation of Yang being primarily cold. In this way, the condition of Tai Yang becomes cold while the internal state is warm, resulting in cold and warm differing manifestations. Above Shao Yin, hot qi is controlled, leading to the manifestation of Yin being primarily hot. In this manner, the condition of Shao Yin becomes hot while the internal state is cold, resulting in hot and cold differing manifestations.<a id="trans-479p" href="#orig-479p" class="marker">[479p]</a><br>As for the pulse responding to illness, it is like a sweet melon with a bitter stem, green onion with white leaves, ginseng nourishing while reed purges, and ephedra inducing sweat while its root stops sweat—these are all differing manifestations of the essence of the Taiyang and Shaoyin. There are occurrences of arrival, occurrences that do not arrive, and occurrences that arrive excessively. This refers to the cyclical arrival of yin and yang, responding to the seasons; when the essence transforms accordingly, it is termed arrival, and such arrival is harmonious. If the essence transforms but does not arrive, it is termed arrival but not arriving, indicating that the cyclical essence is insufficient. If the season has not arrived but the essence transforms beforehand, it is termed not arrived yet arriving. Therefore, the transformation of the essence that responds to the season is regarded as harmonious, while what arrives without having reached the season is considered contrary; the contrary leads to the emergence of changes, and with changes, illness arises. Things arise in accordance with their nature, and the essence and pulse respond—this reflects the principle of being harmonious. The classic text mentions that what the Jueyin reaches gives rise to wind-like phenomena, which is the response of things to their nature. When the Jueyin arrives, its pulse is string-like, which is the response of the essence and pulse.<a id="trans-480p" href="#orig-480p" class="marker">[480p]</a><br>According to the emperor&#39;s inquiry about the geographical correspondence of the six solar terms, it pertains to the essence of the seasonal phases. Thus, it is discussed in relation to the yin and yang of the earth, the usual practices of geography, with the term &quot;down&quot; referring to the movement to the left. The geographical response to the six solar terms is divided into six steps, which regulate the seasons in accordance with the six solar positions outside of heaven.</p>
<p>On the right of bright clarity, the position of the royal fire is located at the point of sunrise, to the right of the earth at the eastern-southeastern direction and aligning with spring equinox. After the point associated with the hare, there lies the position of royal fire. Moving right again by one step, the position of associated fire is governed by the southern air, where the fire rules and regulates the energies around the summer solstice. This corresponds with the governance from heaven, presiding over the years of the earth element.</p>
<p>Stepping forward once more, the position of earth governs the energies coming from the southwestern air, with earth ruling and regulating the four energies prior to the autumn equinox. This aligns with the plentiful atmosphere in the left quarters, presiding over the years of the wood element.</p>
<p>Again moving a step further, the position of metal governs the energies from the northwestern air, with metal ruling and regulating the five energies after the autumn equinox. This corresponds to the energies that surround the right of the spring, presiding over the years of the wood element as well.<a id="trans-481p" href="#orig-481p" class="marker">[481p]</a><br>After taking another step, the water energy is governed by the earthly energy reaching the northern direction. The water level issues commands, regulating the energy before and after the winter solstice to correspond with the energy dispersed in the spring. Its operation is subordinate to the years of Bing and Xin, corresponding to the political years of the celestial authority. </p>
<p>After taking another step, the wood energy is governed by the earthly energy reaching the northeast. The wood level issues commands, regulating the energy at the beginning of the spring equinox to correspond with the flourishing energy on the left side of the spring. Its operation is subordinate to the years of Ding and Ren, corresponding to the political years of the celestial authority. </p>
<p>After taking another step, the sovereign fire is governed by the earthly energy reaching the southeast. The sovereign fire level issues commands, regulating the energy after the spring equinox to correspond with the flourishing energy on the right side of the celestial authority. Its operation lasts throughout the year without a predominant year. </p>
<p>In all these six steps and regulations, each energy of its respective direction enters China. Thus, when the wood energy in the east issues commands, the spring energy moves westward, while all of China experiences the warmth of the east, coinciding with the energy found on the left side of the spring. When the sovereign energy in the southern direction issues commands, the summer energy moves northward, while all of China experiences the heat of the south, corresponding to the energy found on the right side of the celestial authority.<a id="trans-482p" href="#orig-482p" class="marker">[482p]</a><br>When the metal in the west governs, the autumn qi travels east, and all of China receives the cool qi of the west, associated with the atmosphere in the left quadrant of the celestial governance. When the water in the north governs, the winter qi travels south, and all of China receives the cold qi of the north, associated with the atmosphere in the right quadrant of the spring. </p>
<p>Below the six qi, each type is supported by the qi it governs, based on the five elements. Each pole gives rise to one phase, and they cycle through interdependently without any interruption. </p>
<p>Under the influence of fire, the water qi supports it. When the summer fire reaches its peak, it leads to the emergence of water, gradually transforming until it arrives at winter. </p>
<p>Under the level of water, the earth qi supports it. When winter&#39;s water reaches its peak, it gives rise to the earth, gradually transforming until it arrives at late summer. </p>
<p>Under the level of earth, the wood qi supports it. When the long summer earth reaches its peak, it gives rise to the wood, gradually transforming until it arrives at spring. </p>
<p>Under the level of wood, the metal qi supports it. When spring&#39;s wood reaches its peak, it gives rise to the metal, gradually transforming until it arrives at autumn. </p>
<p>Under the level of metal, the fire qi supports it. When autumn&#39;s metal reaches its peak, it leads to the emergence of fire, gradually transforming until it arrives at summer. </p>
<p>Under the influence of the sovereign fire, the yin essence supports it. When the summer sovereign fire reaches its peak, the yin essence supports it, gradually transforming until it arrives at winter.<a id="trans-483p" href="#orig-483p" class="marker">[483p]</a><br>Its meaning, akin to the views of the Yin-Yang school regarding water originating from noon and metal from the rabbit, is largely similar, as they all circulate and are inherited to form the foundation. &quot;Kang&quot; represents excess. Excess leads to harm; accepting (or bearing) leads to control, and control promotes transformation. Externally, this expresses prosperity and decline. Harm leads to chaos, and significant disorders in transformation indicate that the energy of six and five has reached extremes and will certainly cause harm. Accepting energy generates from below and controls it to prevent excess. Thus, control comes from subtle transformation, while acceptance externally presents prosperity. Extremes lead to decline from the outside. The cycle of transformation indicates that harm produces chaos and significant illness arises. Prosperity and decline, when not in their proper places, become evil; in their proper places, they become righteous. This connects back to the previous discussion that control leads to transformation, which externally reflects prosperity and decline. Control resists excess and allows transformation of prosperity. Only when the year&#39;s energy is harmonious can its transformations proceed gradually and in sequence.<a id="trans-484p" href="#orig-484p" class="marker">[484p]</a><br>From the subtle to the manifest, all must align correctly within the six positions. If the seasonal energies are excessive or deficient, their transformations will be disordered, sometimes causing equality to be surmounted or the precarious to triumph. Hence, transformations might blend and yield a partial state, not by virtue of their position. Alternatively, transformations might restore supremacy leading to completeness, also not due to their position.</p>
<p>When wood influences the Rabbit, fire influences the Horse, earth corresponds to the four seasons, metal governs the West, and water influences the Rat, this is referred to as the balance of yearly seasonal energies. It indicates that in these eight years, the seasonal energies harmonize with the five movements, creating a balance where their flourish and decline follow a proper sequence aligned with the six positions. Conversely, if other years do not align with the movements, the energies will be excessive or deficient, resulting in disorder in their flourish and decline, also not by virtue of their position.</p>
<p>Some say that Wang&#39;s commentary explains that water represents the acceptance of fire below; when it is excessively hot, it overflows like water. When earth accepts water below, extreme cold makes ice solid like earth. Wind accepting earth below signifies rain driven by strong winds. Metal accepting wind below shows that the wind stirs the air, drying all things. Fire accepting metal below represents fire refining metal. Lin&#39;s rectifications further illustrate that wood can sprout and break. Additionally, he verifies this with phrases like &quot;the arrival of the extreme Yin brings tumultuous rage and great coolness.&quot;<a id="trans-485p" href="#orig-485p" class="marker">[485p]</a><br>In Hejian, it is stated that harm comes from excessively rising, leading to the establishment of the principles of the six characters. Treatises and arguments from both schools refer to the six positions below and their corresponding energies, which create phenomena both in day and night. Now, you uniquely argue that this pertains to the cyclical changes of the four seasons, asserting that there must be a coherent explanation that can validate the gains and losses, right and wrong. </p>
<p>It is said: The classics indicate that through regulation below, generation and transformation occur, and external manifestations of prosperity and decline are listed. When prosperity and decline align with their positions, it is correct; when not, it is erroneous. By discussing the meaning of below, one can tender details adequately, sufficient to verify gains and losses, right and wrong. </p>
<p>Now, the classics say: To the right of the ruler&#39;s fire, retreat one step, the fire of the official governs it, while the water energy supports it; retreating another step, the earth energy governs it, while the wood energy supports it; retreating yet another step, the metal energy governs it, while the fire energy supports it; retreating once more, the water energy governs it, while the earth energy supports it; retreat one more step, the wood energy governs it, while the metal energy supports it; retreating yet again, the ruler&#39;s fire governs it, while the yin essence supports it. This passage pertains to the prosperity and decline in the transformation of energies below, signifying that when they are in their proper positions, it is aligned with the correct principles.<a id="trans-486p" href="#orig-486p" class="marker">[486p]</a><br>The rise and fall of things follow a sequence without chaos. During prosperity, one should take the correct position in governance; during decline, one should inherit the proper position. Each should adhere to the correct principle of its own phase: warmth belongs to spring, heat to summer, coolness to autumn, and cold to winter. When the climate is balanced, it allows for growth and storage. This is the fundamental principle of the classics, discussing the cyclical nature of the four seasons and the proper alignment of transformations.</p>
<p>Wang&#39;s commentary explains the idea of inheriting the underlying principles, while Lin mentions the destruction and bending of wood, representing the violent coolness brought on by the influence of the Extreme Yin. This reflects the fluctuations of growth and decline; when out of place, it leads to disorder. The decline does not follow a sequence, resulting in the violent destruction of wood and extreme anger, which combines and acts in harmony with the destructive qualities of metal, thus disrupting the natural order of growth and decline. </p>
<p>The effects of Extreme Yin, causing violent anger and great coolness, arise from the extreme wood, which leads to chaos and violence. The metal, associated with coolness, retaliates, causing growth and decline to stray far from their rightful positions. Consequently, warmth does not represent spring, heat does not represent summer, coolness does not represent autumn, and cold does not represent winter, leading to various ailments in humans.</p>
<p>This highlights the mistakes of Wang and Lin, who misused the chaotic nature of dawn and dusk as signs of disorder instead of adhering to the proper alignment prescribed in the classics. However, the disruption of proper alignment and the resulting chaos also possess unique characteristics of excessive or insufficient states. Currently, the arguments presented by Hejian, referencing Wang and Lin, emphasize how extremes can harm the natural balance, clarifying the significance of changing energies.<a id="trans-487p" href="#orig-487p" class="marker">[487p]</a><br>It is said that wood resembles metal at its extreme; metal resembles fire at its extreme; fire resembles water at its extreme; water resembles earth at its extreme; and earth resembles wood at its extreme. All these transformations are a result of the excess leading to a resemblance to the overcoming of its own nature. It is also said that when regulated too much, these transformations become mere illusions. It is stated that the regulation of these transformations should focus on mitigating the excess energy, which is the root of the disorder, and one should not mistakenly treat the accompanying transformation.</p>
<p>Scholars speak of the transformations of the five energies as they become abundant, while those that are insufficient have not yet manifested. According to the Great Treatise on Governance of the Five Constants, if wood is insufficient, it is termed &quot;degenerated harmony&quot;; the nature of this is soft and restrained; its taste is sour and pungent; its color is pale white; its sound is the horn and the shang. If fire is insufficient, it is termed &quot;repressed illumination&quot;; its nature is marked by evident changes and transformations; its taste is bitter and salty; its color is bright red; its sound is the zheng and the feather. If earth is insufficient, it is termed &quot;low surveillance&quot;; its nature results in sores and pus, and the splitting of abscesses; its taste is sour and sweet; its color is yellowish-green; its sound is the gong and the horn. If metal is insufficient, it is termed &quot;subsequent transformation&quot;; its nature results in intense sounds and confusion; its taste is bitter and pungent; its color is white and red; its sound is the shang and zheng. If water is insufficient, it is termed &quot;dried flow&quot;; its nature is characterized by hardness and stillness; its taste is sweet and salty; its color is dark; its sound is the feather and the low harmony.<a id="trans-488p" href="#orig-488p" class="marker">[488p]</a><br>What is referred to as soft, oblique, and restrained? Softness, according to Wang, means to shorten. When the branches of wood extend but do not reach their utmost, they are then shortened by metal, which transforms and compensates for them, achieving mastery despite being out of position. Oblique refers to the bending and twisting of the limbs. Restraint denotes the strength of tendons and vessels. Wood is bent and restrained as it is influenced by the shortening of metal. Slowness indicates the relaxation of tendons and vessels. When metal overcomes wood, earth diminishes in fear; thus, earth transforms and relaxes into its gaps, while those who are restrained restrain themselves, and those who are slow are slow themselves. Sour, bitter, white, and blue pungents are all instances of wood failing to reach its utmost; metal compensates for them despite being out of position. Fuxing, what is called the manifestation of change? Manifestation refers to the clarity and brightness of fire. Concealment refers to the hidden depths of water. Change indicates that fire does not reach water but partially manifests or conceals; change is not constant. The bitter and salty elements, as well as the original essence, are cases where fire fails to reach its utmost, with water compensating despite being out of position. The principle of dips and heights refers to the emergence and rupture of sores and swellings. Sores and swellings are caused by earth’s obstruction. Emergence and rupture pertain to the opening and splitting of wood.<a id="trans-489p" href="#orig-489p" class="marker">[489p]</a><br>The earth becomes obstructed and develops ulcers and swelling; when wood simultaneously transforms and emerges, it causes surging and bursting through the obstruction. The sour, sweet, and pale colors indicate that the earth is inadequate, leading to premature demise, while wood takes on a role it shouldn&#39;t and transforms into something else. From the change, the so-called &quot;clang, obstruct, dizzy, and faint&quot; arises. The &quot;clang&quot; refers to the sound of metal transforming, leading to coughing. &quot;Obstruct&quot; means to hold back breath and suppress coughs. When metal in the lungs is excessive, the desire for air expands, causing wheezing; when metal is deficient, there is a desire to retain breath and suppress it. The &quot;clang&quot; is coughing. &quot;Dizzy&quot; refers to confusion. &quot;Faint&quot; means to be opposite or in reverse. When metal transforms into clang without deficiency, fire takes over. The dizzying, faint, and reverse energy rises from the emptiness of suppression. The bitter, spicy, white, and red components indicate that metal is deficient, leading to premature demise, while fire assumes a role it shouldn&#39;t and transforms. The term &quot;dried-up flow,&quot; known as &quot;stubborn stoppage,&quot; describes rigidity and stillness. When water is scarce, it becomes firm and dry, and earth enforces this stillness. The sweet and salty elements, pale and primordial, indicate that water is insufficient, leading to premature demise, while earth takes on a role it shouldn&#39;t and transforms. All of this represents transformations resulting from depleted energy; thus, the treatment should focus on replenishing this deficiency, rather than using purging methods appropriate for abundant energy transformations.<a id="trans-490p" href="#orig-490p" class="marker">[490p]</a><br>In contemporary Hejian, it is said that governing involves both treatment and transformation. However, should one not alleviate the extreme excesses of the root energy? The transformations that are included stem from a deficiency of the root energy, which can be overcome by what is received. Without intervention, the root energy will further decline, and the received energy will become overpowering. Thus, when one speaks of transformation as similar to an empty appearance, can one not say it should not be addressed? This is where Hejian misinterprets, believing that both excessive and insufficient transformations are overly excessive.</p>
<p>It is said that the Wang, Lin, and Hejian clans have lost the true intent of the classics and have already received mandates in this regard. Nevertheless, the six levels of the received energy, which maintain the proper transformation, those that indicate the changes of overcoming variation, and those that elaborate on harmony and discord, are still worthy of exploration, and can be verified through the classic principles. </p>
<p>It is said that true sincerity without end is the essence of the Dao. Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements flow through heaven and earth, with one extreme giving rise to another and endlessly supporting each other, in a cycle that is boundless; this is the essence of the Dao. Therefore, with regard to their mutual support, when spoken of in terms of Yin and Yang, during the winter solstice, the extreme of Yin leads to the emergence of Yang, and during the summer solstice, the extreme of Yang leads to the emergence of Yin. When discussed in terms of the Five Elements, the Five Elements themselves correspond to the mutual support of Yin and Yang, each having its own distinction between fullness and youth. Thus, fire is the fullness of Yang, water the fullness of Yin, wood the youth of Yang, metal the youth of Yin, and earth bears Yin while embracing Yang as the energizing force.<a id="trans-491p" href="#orig-491p" class="marker">[491p]</a><br>In the relationship of yin and yang, during the winter solstice, yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to emerge; this starts in the long summer, where the energy of the earth is at its peak. In spring, the young wood gives rise to yang, then in autumn, the young metal reaches its extreme yin. In turn, the flourishing fire brings forth yang, culminating in winter. The abundance of water signifies extreme yin, with the earth&#39;s energy nurturing it.</p>
<p>During the summer solstice, yang reaches its peak and yin is generated, starting in spring, where the young wood is at its extreme yang. Then, in summer, the young metal reaches its extreme yin, and in the thriving summer, the flourishing fire symbolizes the peak of yang. Yin essence begins to emerge, culminating in summer, where the intense fire&#39;s peak leads to the emergence of yin, completing a yearly cycle.</p>
<p>In the context of the Five Elements, interactions occur as follows: yang fire is engaged with the essence of yin water beneath it; beneath the water is the earth&#39;s energy, marking the first year. Below the earth is the energy of wood, signifying the second year. Below the wood is the energy of metal, and beneath the metal is the energy of fire, completing a cycle of three years and then repeating.<a id="trans-492p" href="#orig-492p" class="marker">[492p]</a><br>Thus, the blending of yin and yang, the division into the five elements, and their constant interdependence and endless cycles arise from the essence of mutual support, which is sincere and ceaseless. The sage observes the river and states, &quot;Those who flow like this do not cease day or night,&quot; which rightly refers to this essence of sincere continuity. However, when discussing mutual support as a structure, it is indeed this sincere and ceaseless nature that attaches itself without change or deviation. When speaking of its flow in application, it manifests at the extremes of balance; those who properly assume their positions correspond to the constant of right transformation and harmony, while those who do not assume their proper positions correspond to the chaotic transformations resulting from excess or deficiency. The constant is a gradual progression, reflecting the cyclical changes of the four seasons; the transformations may either unleash overwhelming might, reaching extremes in improper positions or fall short of required strength, leading to deficiencies in those positions. Thus, what is supported follows the maximum limitset below, while transgressing ranks to change its fundamental energy, causing abrupt transformations at dawn and dusk. Hence, a partial change occurs when fundamental energy is partially diminished, descending to a half-strong state and resulting in a moderate transformation relative to improper positioning. A complete change occurs when fundamental energy is entirely depleted, descending to a fully thriving state leading to an overwhelming return to improper positioning.<a id="trans-493p" href="#orig-493p" class="marker">[493p]</a><br>Harmony and change signify virtue and the governance of decrees, while discord and change lead to disaster and injury. In what is known as the occurrence of phenomena, such changes that resonate, shake, and uproot, are excessive transformations. When timber cannot withstand virtue, it leads to retraction and restoration, which represents an excessive recovery. In the context of harmony, behaviors that are soft, restrained, and slow reflect inadequate transformations. Conditions of strictness, scorching heat, and boiling over represent the triumph of virtue over governance. When water yields hail and snow, and wood results in destruction and breakage, these signify disasters and injuries caused by dual transformations. The birth of the Yin results in fierce winds and great chills, while the arrival of the Shao Yin leads to severe warmth and cold; these too indicate the victory of disasters and injuries. Thus, the essence is of utmost sincerity and perpetual motion, yet the extremes and inheritances of change and discord are not consistent. As a result, the responses observed will vary, showing correct transformations, dual transformations, triumphs, and the different aspects of minor and major disasters and auspices. The Wang and Lin families fail to differentiate changes, interpreting transformation as merely altering the atmosphere; the Hejian school does not distinguish between emptiness and reality, interpreting dual transformations as mere abundance; both are errors in understanding.<a id="trans-494p" href="#orig-494p" class="marker">[494p]</a><br>The Emperor asked about the paths and the use of seasons. Thus, it is said that the yin and yang of heaven and earth alternate and transform, as movement and stillness invoke one another, and the upper and lower realms correspond with each other; this is the essence of the intermingling of yin and yang.  </p>
<p>The &quot;paths&quot; refer to the six steps of the earth mentioned in the previous text. Sixty degrees have odd characteristics; the six steps of the earth revolve around the heavens in a complete circle of three hundred sixty-five degrees, which is the number of days in a year. Each step is made up of sixty degrees with odd peculiarities. Thus, one day corresponds to one degree, with sixty days equating to eighty-seven and a half divisions, signifying one step. In a year, without exceeding a day, twenty-four steps accumulate, and every four years, the remaining oddities sum up to a hundred divisions, resulting in an additional day to conclude the year, termed a cycle.  </p>
<p>The six airs responding to the changes of the five elements indicate a correlation with the previous text regarding the celestial cycles and the geographical positions of the six solar terms. Therefore, the Emperor inquired further. The six airs of heaven—wind, heat, moisture, fire, dryness, and cold—correspond to the five elements of the earth, namely wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, enforcing their regulation throughout the year. How do we seek the transformation of their intermingling energies? &quot;Position,&quot; here, refers to the path or step. Each position has its beginning and end, determining the potency of the six airs of heaven in accordance with the regulatory influences of the five elements on earth—all occurring within the same step, while their timing exhibits its own commencement and conclusion.<a id="trans-495p" href="#orig-495p" class="marker">[495p]</a><br>There are initial and middle stages of Qi. Each step marks the fullness of the beginning and ending of Qi, divided into front and back. The first half of a step represents the initial Qi, associated with the rising of terrestrial Qi, while the second half represents the final Qi, which relates to the descending of celestial Qi. The Qi of heaven and earth interacts at the terminal points, and the initial and middle Qis differ; thus, the methods of seeking them are also different. The heavenly Qi starts at Jia, and the earthly Qi starts at Zi, with methods of seeking positions linked to their beginnings and endings. The Qi of heaven and earth should be sought from the start of the Jia-Zi year. By carefully observing the time of their beginnings and endings, one can anticipate the arrival of the climatic conditions. If the six Qis begin and end early or late within a year, this indicates the distinction in the beginnings and endings of the two Qis of heaven and earth, governed by step intervals. Within these intervals, there are six steps each year, and for each step, the beginning and ending of the Qi of heaven and earth each govern for sixty days and eighty-seven and a half kè. Annually, each beginning and ending of Qi governing lasts for three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five kè. Now the Emperor first inquires about the Qi of the annual six steps, concerning the timing of their beginnings and endings and whether they are early or late.<a id="trans-496p" href="#orig-496p" class="marker">[496p]</a><br>In the year of Jiazhi, the beginning occurs at a moment past the water, concluding at seven and a half eighty-sevenths. The year of Jiazhi has six phases. The heavenly qi is under the control of Shaoyin, with Taiyin on the left and Jueyin on the right; Yangming is at the spring, with Taiyang on the left and Shaoyang on the right, each flourishing in its respective phase, responding to one another. The earthly qi corresponds to its decree. Now, at the beginning qi, the cold qi of Taiyang is strong in the left spring, corresponding to the northeastern wood qi’s decree, and shares the mastery of the sixty days before the vernal equinox at seven and a half eighty-sevenths, characterized by the early and late climates. </p>
<p>The second qi begins at six minutes past eighty-seven, concluding at seventy-five. The control of the heavens has Jueyin’s wind qi strong on the right, corresponding to the southeastern fire qi’s decree, sharing the mastery of the sixty days after the vernal equinox at seven and a half eighty-sevenths, characterized by the early and late climates. </p>
<p>The third qi begins at seventy-six and concludes at sixty-two and a half. The control of the heavens is under Shaoyin, where the warm administration is spread out, corresponding to the southern fire qi’s decree, sharing the mastery of the sixty days before and after the summer solstice at seven and a half eighty-sevenths, characterized by the early and late climates.<a id="trans-497p" href="#orig-497p" class="marker">[497p]</a><br>The energy of the Four begins at 62 divisions and 6 minutes and ends at 50 divisions; this corresponds to a strong moisture in the left space of heaven, aligned with the dominant earthy energy of the southwest, and is equally governed by the 60 days before the autumn equinox, spanning 87 and a half divisions, marking the early and late phases. The energy of the Five starts at 51 divisions and ends at 37 and a half divisions, prevalent in the right space of the spring where fire energy is abundant. This corresponds to the dominant metal energy of the northwest and similarly governs the 60 days after the autumn equinox, also spanning 87 and a half divisions, marking the early and late phases. The energy of the End begins at 37 divisions and 6 minutes and ends at 25 divisions, filled with dry energy in the sunlight of the spring. This corresponds to the dominant water energy of the northern direction and similarly governs the 60 days around the winter solstice, also spanning 87 and a half divisions, marking the early and late phases. The energy of heaven and earth operates through six phases within the year of Jiazi, marking the early and late phases, with similar applications in subsequent years. The seasonal markers are questions posed by the emperor regarding the seasonal indicators. The governance of heaven and earth within a single year, with the weather overseen by the heavens above, collectively governs the year. The energy of the earth operates in the center, forming a pair with it, combining the two energies’ indicators to begin and end within a single year. The sun travels through a year while also completing a full cycle of the heavens.<a id="trans-498p" href="#orig-498p" class="marker">[498p]</a><br>The Qi begins from a moment: in the year of Jiazi, the celestial aspect is governed by the Lesser Yin&#39;s warm Qi, within the seasonal cycle of the Yangming dryness, and during the middle of the Earth, the Qi of the Great Palace is present, marking the beginning of management for that year. When the sun travels through the twenty-six markers, in the year of Yichou, the celestial aspect is governed by the Taiyin&#39;s damp Qi, within the seasonal cycle of the Yangming dryness, and during the middle of the Earth, the Qi of the Lesser Shang is present, marking the beginning of management for that year. When the sun travels through the fifty-one markers, in the year of Bingyin, the celestial aspect is governed by the Lesser Yang&#39;s fire Qi, within the seasonal cycle of the Jueyin&#39;s wind Qi, and during the middle of the Earth, the Qi of the Great Feather water is present, marking the beginning of management for that year. When the sun travels through the seventy-six markers, in the year of Dingmao, the celestial aspect is governed by the Yangming dryness, within the seasonal cycle of the Lesser Yin&#39;s warm Qi, and during the middle of the Earth, the Qi of the Lesser Horn wood is present, marking the beginning of management for that year. This is the essence of the Qi of Heaven and Earth; in the initial period of four years, the beginning and end conditions can be similarly extended to the remaining periods. The user looks to the previous year&#39;s beginnings and endings to seek the Qi of Heaven and Earth. To speak of Heaven seeks its foundation, to speak of Earth seeks its application, to speak of humans looks for the transition of years, speaking to the usage of the previous year&#39;s beginnings and endings. When seeking the weather of Heaven, one seeks the fundamental Qi of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire; the standards and the central Qi need not be sought.<a id="trans-499p" href="#orig-499p" class="marker">[499p]</a><br>To seek the energy of the earth is to seek the positions of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water; the energy below that does not need to be sought. To seek the energy of humanity is to seek the energy that should be seen in the interactions of qi; if it is not seen, it does not need to be sought. When discussing the energy at the start of the year of Jiazi, seeking the energy of heaven refers to the heat governed by the heavenly officials, the dryness of springs, and the cold adjacent to the springs. To seek the energy of the earth is to seek the earth of the central movement and the wood of the main division. To seek the energy of humanity is to seek the energy that should be seen in the interactions of qi. Whether it is hot, dry, cold, earthy, or watery, these five energies are constant; anything other than these five is a corrupt transformation of imbalance. The interactions of qi occur at the junction of the two energies of heaven and earth, with the human body serving as the boundary at the midpoint. Above this midpoint, the domain of the heavenly officials governs the energy of heaven, while below it, the domain of springs governs the energy of the earth.<a id="trans-500p" href="#orig-500p" class="marker">[500p]</a><br>The interplay of the two energies of heaven and earth occurs at the boundary of the celestial pivot, which is where human energy originates and where all things derive from. Hence, it is called the convergence of energies. This encompasses the cyclical phenomena of heaven and earth, an unchanging essence through the ages. </p>
<p>Initially, there are thirty degrees with anomalies; the central energy aligns with established principles, seeking energy that has initial and central methods. It is stated that each cycle lasts sixty days and consists of eighty-seven and a half divisions. The first thirty days with anomalies are regarded as initial energy, belonging to the yang of the month, where all energies below the celestial pivot rise. The latter thirty days with anomalies are considered central energy, belonging to the yin, where all energies above the celestial pivot descend.</p>
<p>Regarding the initial energies of the year of Jiazi, energies below the celestial pivot pertain to the dry energy of springs, cold energy in the left channel of the springs, earthy energy within the central realm, and wood energy in the main region, all of which rise. The energies above the celestial pivot relate to the descending hot energy of heaven. </p>
<p>Rising leads to descending, and descending signifies the flow on earth; conversely, descending leads to rising where the energies soar into heaven. Therefore, the high and the low summon each other, and rising and falling follow one another. From this intricate interplay and mingling of energies, the balance and transformation arise, creating shifts and recoveries in the convergence of energies.<a id="trans-501p" href="#orig-501p" class="marker">[501p]</a><br>The essence of heaven and earth is balanced and equal; therefore, between rising and falling, each maintains its boundary and responds to the constant transformations of the seasons. When there is abundance or scarcity, those that are abundant and similar in nature prevail; when they prevail, they exceed the established order of the seasons. Conversely, those that are scarce and similar in nature are disregarded; when they are disregarded, they become part of the energies outside the established seasonal order. The energies that come and prevail continually change, thus maintaining transformations and resurgence. </p>
<p>All of this reflects the rising and falling energies of heaven and earth, which fluctuate with time. Some say: in the phases of heaven’s yin and yang across the six seasons, the two phases presided over by heaven are specifically the springs, which govern the entire year. Why is it that the other four phases flourish only in their respective steps? It is because the two phases presided over by heaven occupy the center of heaven and earth. Their rising and falling are always balanced in the central region, thus governing the entire year. The other four phases are located in the four directions, with their rising and falling not centered; they merely govern the energies of the regions they occupy. The energy corresponding to spring moves westward, summer northward, autumn eastward, and winter southward, eventually returning to the central region to flourish. Hence, these four phases each flourish independently in their seasonal governance.</p>
<p>As for transformations and changes that occur beyond the established order, even without the influence of seasonal governance, they also circulate back into the central region.<a id="trans-502p" href="#orig-502p" class="marker">[502p]</a><br>It is said that the heavenly phenomena are ordered by the sequences of warm, humid, fiery, dry, and cold, with humidity preceding fire; the earthly phenomena are ordered by the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, with earth following fire. The presence of humidity and earth is one essence, yet their positional differences exist—why is this? It is because in the heavens, it is a matter of qi, thus they are ordered by the amount of the three yin and three yang energies; on the earth, it is a matter of forms, thus they are ordered by the generative sequences of the five elements. The ordering by the amount of qi starts with the lesser and gradually increases, beginning with the first yin, which is called Jue Yin (厥阴); the next is Shao Yin (少阴), which is the second yin; the last is Tai Yin (太阴), which is the third yin. The ordering of yang begins with Shao Yang (少阳), which is the first yang; the next is Yang Ming (阳明), which is the second yang, and then Tai Yang (太阳), which is the third yang. Thus, heavenly phenomena are ordered by the amounts of yin and yang, with humidity preceding fire. The ordering of forms generating each other begins and continues endlessly, thus the qi starts with wood, the initial qi; wood generates fire, hence the fire of the lord is the second qi, and the fire of the companion is the third qi; fire generates earth, hence earth is the fourth qi; earth generates metal, hence metal is the fifth qi; metal generates water, hence water is the final qi, which then regenerates wood. Thus, earthly phenomena are ordered by the generative relationships of the five elements, with earth following fire. Wang Tai Pu ordered Shao Yang after Tai Yang, while Chen Wu Ze ordered humid earth to generate companion fire, which can be said to not delve into the essence of the classics.<a id="trans-503p" href="#orig-503p" class="marker">[503p]</a><br>According to the correspondence of cold and heat, dryness and moisture, and the confrontation of wind and fire, if there are intervals, there should be no storage or transformation at the seasonal divisions. Here, it discusses the changes of yin and yang in heaven and earth. When cold and moisture correspond, and dryness and heat confront, is there any interval at the junction of these interactions?</p>
<p>The Emperor, following the previous discussion on the principles of the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, inquires about the interplay of cold, moisture, dryness, heat, wind, and fire, specifically whether there are gaps in their interactions of ascent and descent. Qi Bo responds, stating that qi has the ability to dominate and recover. He explains that when heaven and earth correspond, confront, or interact, the five elements experience fluctuations in abundance and scarcity. At the junction of ascent and descent, there is a constant struggle between strength and weakness, with no gaps in their interactions.<a id="trans-504p" href="#orig-504p" class="marker">[504p]</a><br>Therefore, the creation of its victories and reversals occurs at the intersections of ascent and descent, where there are virtues of harmony, clarity, warmth, cleanliness, and melancholy. There are transformations of life, flourishing, abundance, restraint, and tranquility. There are utilities of curvature and straightness, burning and melting, heights and depths, dispersion and nurturing. There are changes of destruction, heat, indulgence, desolation, and chilling. It is only through change that evil energy resides, leading to sickness and death in humans. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked what is meant by evil and why change is called evil. Qi Bo replied that the life of things derives from transformation, and the extremes of things come from change. The transformation of the two energies is like the oppositions of yin and yang, night and day; thus, the life of things comes from transformation while extremes derive from change. As such, transformation corresponds with the correct energy, while change is the source of evil energy, hence change is considered evil. </p>
<p>Qi has periods of circulation, and its uses vary in speed. The energies of change have cycles of return; the uses derived from these cycles also differ in pace. For instance, as the &quot;Classic&quot; states, spring has the harmonious emergence of chirping while autumn brings the refreshing governance of mist and dew, exemplifying the cyclical nature of transformative energy. Winter, with its harsh and desolate extremes, contrasts with summer&#39;s scorching heat and consuming changes, demonstrating the cyclic return of transformation. Furthermore, the reactions prompted by lesser yin leading to significant warmth or cold, and by greater yang leading to dispersive warmth, reveal instances where the cyclical uses occur with differing velocities.<a id="trans-505p" href="#orig-505p" class="marker">[505p]</a><br>All changes must involve the four aspects of slow and rapid, coming and going; these are foundational. Then, regarding proper winds and aberrant winds, they initially affect the weak. Success and failure depend on the conditions that fluctuate in the middle. In winter, one suffers from cold; in spring, one is bound to be ill from warmth; in spring, one is injured by wind; in summer, one is susceptible to diarrhea. This is akin to what Zhongjing referred to as latent energy and latent cold. The emperor asked about the slow and rapid, the coming and going, the wind&#39;s origination and transformation, hence the natural occurrence of winds due to the ebb and flow of qi. People perceive these winds as determinants of success and failure; hence, they fluctuate in their conditions, but do not align with the feelings they experience in that moment. Why is this? Qibo replied that success and failure, the states of being present or absent, arise from movement. When movement does not cease, then the meaning of dependency and fluctuation starts to clarify. Danxi&#39;s view that cold injury pertains to internal harm is a notion that holds considerable truth. Those who are present or absent are all influenced by human movements. When a person moves in accordance with rhythm and self-nourishment, their qi harmonizes, and what they sense, too, harmonizes to become the vital energy nourishing their being, hence they fluctuate in the middle.<a id="trans-506p" href="#orig-506p" class="marker">[506p]</a><br>When a person moves without regulation and is weary, their vital energy becomes disordered, and what they sense also transforms into disordered energy, settling within as the root of bodily disease, lurking within. If movement does not cease, weariness is endless, and heavy sensations disturb the energy, then what was once lurking begins to emerge and transform. &quot;Period&quot; refers to the time of transformation, indicating movement that does not act on itself. If there is no birth or transformation, and the period is one of stillness, then it is akin to death. Thus, it is said that without birth or transformation, the period is one of stillness. Therefore, for animals, when still, the breath entering and exiting through the mouth and nose is exhausted, and the spirit’s mechanisms are extinguished as a period; for plants, stillness means the rising and falling of roots and branches ceases, leading to a period of solitary danger in the vital energy. Thus, without the breath of animals, there is no growth, aging, or vitality; without the transformation of plants, there is no growth or accumulation. Therefore, rising, falling, entering, and exiting are omnipresent. Thus, the mechanisms of animals and plants are the dwellings of transformation and life. When energy disperses, entering and exiting, rising and falling, separate and give rise to transformation and breath. Hence, there is nothing that does not enter and exit, nothing that does not rise and fall. Transformation has both large and small aspects, from the slightest movements to the vastness of heaven and earth; periods have both proximity and distance, from the mayfly, born in the morning and perishing by evening, to the longevity of the tortoise and the crane, living for thousands of years. All these four aspects of size and distance are precious in maintaining constancy; deviating from this leads to disasters and abrupt ends to periods of stillness.<a id="trans-507p" href="#orig-507p" class="marker">[507p]</a><br><strong>On the Fundamentals of the Six Elements and the Great Discussion of the Qi Dynamics</strong></p>
<p>According to the Great Discussion of the Six Elements, the proper function of the six transformations and the regular patterns of change leads to the understanding of how the energies of heaven and earth fluctuate. This includes the discussion of the five movements and six qi&#39;s convergence in different conditions. The proper function of the six transformations refers to the consistent energies, while the regular patterns of the six changes refer to the variable energies. The six conditions encompass transformation, change, dominance, return, utility, and illness: the condition of transformation aligns with the proper function of the six transformations; the conditions of change, dominance, return, utility, and illness correspond to the regular patterns of the six changes. </p>
<p>The arrival of the utmost yin signifies a balanced flow, regulating the twelve solar terms and discussing the three conditions of transformation, change, and illness. There are the constancy of seasonal transformations, the constancy of administrative orders, and the general rules of operations influencing the conditions of transformation; the constancy of qi variations pertains to the conditions of change; and the constancy of illness concerns the conditions of illness. In all, these twelve variations describe one aspect of change, related to the two conditions of dominance and return. The application of the six qi relates to the seasonal aspects, corresponding to one condition of utility. The constancy of seasonal transformation relates to the regular transformation of the six departments. The constancy of similarity relates to the administration of heaven in the springs. The constancy of energy transformation refers to the regular transformations of the five movements.<a id="trans-508p" href="#orig-508p" class="marker">[508p]</a><br>The arrival of Jueyin results in the generation of wind, ultimately leading to dryness; Shaoyin leads to the generation of heat, and culminates in cold; Taiyin initiates humidity, ultimately resulting in rain; Shaoyang gives rise to fire, ending in vapor; Yangming brings about dryness, finishing in coolness; Taiyang results in cold, with warmth in between. These six phenomena of wind, heat, humidity, fire, dryness, and cold are the primary qi; while the final states of dryness, rain, vapor, and coolness are the derived qi; the middle states of cold and warmth represent the central qi. The essence of each begins with the primary qi and concludes with the derived qi, while the final qi consistently resides within the relationship of primary and derived. Thus, when discussing primary and derived, the central qi is embedded within. The reason Shaoyin and Taiyang mention the middle without concluding is that the central qi of Shaoyin and Taiyang is identical to the derived qi; therefore, when mentioning the middle, the derived qi is considered to also be included.<a id="trans-509p" href="#orig-509p" class="marker">[509p]</a><br>The constancy of virtue transformation refers to the regularization of the growth of plants through virtue. Following this, the constancy of virtue transformation also pertains to the regularization of the development of animals through virtue. All these twelve transformations imply the variations that occur due to previous virtue transformations, administrative decrees, and changing conditions in response to the twelve indicators. If the timing of the seasonal progression does not align properly with the rightful positions of subject and guest, then it results in atmospheric changes leading to a victorious recovery. </p>
<p>As for the signs of recovery, when the victorious energy transforms the virtue, it rewards with virtue; when change occurs, it rewards with transformation; and when policies shift, it rewards with administration. However, the circulation of energy cannot be moved from its original path. If the transformed energy is high, the response will also be high; if it is low, the response will be low; if it is behind, the response will be behind; if it is ahead, the response will be ahead; if it is in the middle, the response will be in the middle; if it is outside, the response will be outside. The positioning of high and low cannot be altered either.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the changes of wind, cold, heat, humidity, dryness, and fire in the world cannot be uniform. The south experiences dryness and drought, while the north has rain and humidity; the central plains endure ice and cold, while the sides are damp and hot.<a id="trans-510p" href="#orig-510p" class="marker">[510p]</a><br>Moreover, geography has heights and depths, and terrain has sizes. The high places have cold air and are often clear and dry, while the low places have hot air and are often rainy and humid. Smaller differences are minor, while larger differences are significant, all mixed up in the ever-changing ways of nature. The Wang family explains the heights and depths, as well as the fore and aft in human experiences of illness, without considering the divisions of geography. This reflects Chengzi&#39;s view that the droughts and floods of the world are consistently different, which is not merely dictated by the cycles of fortune in a given year.</p>
<p>When wind is dominant, movement occurs; when heat is dominant, swelling arises; when dryness is dominant, things become parched; when cold is dominant, they become buoyant; when humidity is dominant, they become wet and leak. In severe cases, water can cause blockages leading to swelling, which varies according to where the air resides, indicating the changing conditions where illness occurs. </p>
<p>For instance, if the wind is dominant in high places, then a person will feel a heavy head and dizziness when at a height; if the wind is dominant in low places, then that person will feel tremors and movement in their legs. Similarly, if heat is dominant in high places, swelling and heat will manifest around the waist; if heat is dominant in low places, the same will happen below the waist. All of these variations in illness correspond to where the six qi (vital energies) dominate, in terms of height, depth, fore, aft, and in-and-out positions.</p>
<p>The application of the six qi returns to the principle of non-dominance, manifested as transformation, meaning they each revert to areas where they are non-dominant at monthly intervals. The monthly cycle, for example, is when the jueyin governs the celestial year; at that time, the yangming position lies on the left near the spring, in the northeast, corresponding to the initial qi; the taiyang position is on the right near the spring, in the southeast, corresponding to the second qi. The jueyin position governs above, facing directly south, corresponding to the third qi; and the shaoyin position is on the left near the heavens, in the southwest, corresponding to the fourth qi.<a id="trans-511p" href="#orig-511p" class="marker">[511p]</a><br>The position of the Moon is between the right of the spring, facing the northwest, associated with the energy of the number five; the position of the Lesser Yang is at the spring, facing directly north, associated with the energy of completion. Therefore, in the annual application, the Moon&#39;s rain transformation is administered in the southeast, corresponding to the energy of two and the position of the Sun; the Sun&#39;s cold transformation is administered in the southwest, corresponding to the energy of four and the position of the Lesser Yin; the Lesser Yin&#39;s heat transformation is administered in the northeast, corresponding to the initial energy and the position of the Yang Ming; the Yang Ming&#39;s dryness transformation is administered directly south, corresponding to the energy of three and the position of the Absolute Yin; the Absolute Yin&#39;s wind transformation is administered in the northwest, corresponding to the energy of five and the position of the Moon. Each transformation is determined by its location to validate its application according to the annual method. When one gains their position, transformation is administered in the direction of their original position.<a id="trans-512p" href="#orig-512p" class="marker">[512p]</a><br>In a year of the Jueyin, the Taiyin is positioned in the northwest, where its five energies embody the transformation of rain; the Yang is in the southeast, where its two energies embody the transformation of cold; the Shaoyin is in the southwest, where its four energies embody the transformation of heat; the Shaoyang is in the due north, where its overall energy embodies the transformation of fire; the Yangming is in the northeast, where its initial energy embodies the transformation of dryness; and the Jueyin is in the due south, where its three energies embody the transformation of wind. This can be applied uniformly across the years. </p>
<p>For those of great constitution, there is a gradual and constant accumulation of qi, which corresponds to illness; thus, their condition appears to wane slowly and subtly, necessitating treatment in opposition to it. For those of lesser constitution, there is a violent and sudden depletion of qi, which corresponds to illness; therefore, their condition appears suddenly and severely, and treatment should conform to this. When one observes their qi as violent and intense, and hastily employs strong remedies against it, then the heat illness remains unresolved, and the cold illness may re-emerge. One fails to realize that the qi of those with a strong constitution appears to wane, while the qi of those with a weak constitution appears to intensify.<a id="trans-513p" href="#orig-513p" class="marker">[513p]</a><br>The True Principles of Treating Illnesses According to Qi</p>
<p>This text discusses the use of the five flavors and the principles of yin and yang, as well as the methods of curing diseases caused by imbalances in internal qi. It is understood that illnesses arise from the disharmony of internal qi, and thus the treatment should target the subtle energies of the affliction. If the condition is severe and treatment is applied incorrectly, it can lead to a confrontation between the rightful and the evil, making it difficult to overcome the illness, and life may be at risk. Therefore, one must be mindful to address the external symptoms of cold or heat while administering the appropriate remedy internally, allowing the rightful energies to counter the evil.</p>
<p>For instance, recommendations by Dongyuan include using ginger with a warming drink for cold symptoms, while Zhang Zhongjing proposed adding gallbladder extract to Baitong decoction to treat conditions of the lesser yin that involve cold. Similarly, Danxi advised that stir-fried mixtures in Qinhong decoction can treat women suffering from cold due to color and sight issues.</p>
<p>When the qi is balanced, treatment methods can be applied when illnesses stem from external evils, regardless of their degree of cold or heat. Whether the approach is counteractive or supportive is acceptable, and there is no need to fear confrontation between rightful and evil, as a strong rightful energy will cause the evil to recede on its own.<a id="trans-514p" href="#orig-514p" class="marker">[514p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 119: The Gate of Fate</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Divination of Five Movements</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: I have heard about the concept of the Five Movements from the Master; it does not align with Yin and Yang. What is the reason for this? Qibo replied: This is the clarification of the Dao. It pertains to the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth. The numbers that can be counted are those of Yin and Yang among people. However, the number that aligns can be obtained. The concept of Yin and Yang can be counted to ten, extrapolated to a hundred, counted to a thousand, and extended to ten thousand. The Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth are not pushed through counting but are indicated through images. The energy of the Red Sky is governed by the Cow and the Girl, corresponding to the Wu and Gui. The energy of the Dark Sky corresponds to the Heart and the Tail, relating to the Ji. The Dark Sky’s energy is associated with the Devil in a precarious chamber.<a id="trans-515p" href="#orig-515p" class="marker">[515p]</a><br>The essence of the Pure Sky traverses through the positions of the stars Di, Kang, and the Beixin constellation.</p>
<p>The essence of the Primordial Sky traverses through the positions of Zhang and Yi in the constellations.</p>
<p>What is meant by the separation of Wu and Ji is represented by the constellations of Kui, Bi, Jiao, and Zhi, which serve as the gateways of heaven and earth. </p>
<p>Wu and Ji are positioned among wood, fire, metal, and water; they are gateways in heaven and earth and represent the long summer in the four seasons, linked to the south with Wu and to the west with Shen. Therefore, Wu and Ji do not have fixed positions, yet they are uniquely referred to as Wu and Ji. Wu fire is linked with Shen, placing Wei earth in between; Gui fire is linked with Yin, placing Chou earth in between. This illustrates how the moist earth is central, with fire moving within it, residing in front of earth in heaven and behind earth in the ground, thus causing a constant mingling of earth and fire.</p>
<p>The beginnings of choosing signs and the birth of the Way must not be neglected.</p>
<p>The arrival of the five essences each has its own five colors, traversing through the fields. When the essence is excessive, it arrives pre-naturally; when it is insufficient, it arrives post-naturally. Hence, one usually observes the signs before Yin and Mao, which naturally becomes apparent. This is the starting point of divination and the birthplace of the Way, which must not be ignored.<a id="trans-516p" href="#orig-516p" class="marker">[516p]</a></p>
<h3>Interpretation of Excess in the Five Movements</h3>
<p>In years of the Wood element (Ren), there is excessive Wood, leading to a flourishing of winds. The Earth element of the Spleen is afflicted, corresponding to the Year Star. <strong>[Note: The Year Star is bright; when it reverses and guards the constellations, disasters may occur.]</strong> When the transformation of Qi is not well-governed, the vitality runs rampant. Clouds and winds are unsettled, causing vegetation to be disturbed, even leading to their shaking and falling, aligning with the Star of Venus. <strong>[Note: When Wood is abundant but Earth is congested, the transformations are not distributed among all things, hence the vitality governs on its own. The strong winds disturb the vegetation, causing great unrest, even shaking and falling, and the Metal element restores it. Therefore, the Star of Venus reverses and guards, indicating danger.]</strong></p>
<p>In years of the Fire element (Wu), there is excessive Fire, resulting in rampant heat. The Metal element of the Lungs is afflicted, corresponding to the Star of Mercury; the gathering of Qi does not function, and the Yang vitality shines alone, with rain, frost, and cold weather, corresponding to the Star of the Dragon. <strong>[Note: Fire acts alone, with Water restraining it; the Star of the Dragon inversely dominates, resulting in cold calamities for things.

<p>If wood is insufficient, then in spring there are the melodies of thriving branches; this leads to autumn&#39;s mist and cool dews. If spring has the victories of bleak and damaged, then summer experiences the scorching heat’s resurgence. </p>
<p>If fire is insufficient, then summer displays bright and clear transformations; this leads to winter’s cold and austere governance. If summer experiences the bleakness of coagulated chill, then there are unexpected storms and heavy rains. </p>
<p>If earth is insufficient, then the four dimensions bring clouds and moisture as a transformation, leading to spring’s vibrant and bustling governance; when the four dimensions vibrate and float, autumn sees the harsh and incessant rains as a resurgence. </p>
<p>If metal is insufficient, then summer brings forth bright and humid commands, leading to winter’s strict and orderly response. If summer experiences the fiery and scorching transformations, then autumn brings hail, frost, and snow as a resurgence. </p>
<p>If water is insufficient, then the four dimensions create rushing clouds and moisture as a transformation; this leads to the occasional gentle winds emerging. If the four dimensions bring sudden heavy downpours, then there are frequent swaying and floating resurgences. </p>
<p>The governance of the five movements is akin to weighing. The high ones are suppressed, the low ones lifted; what transforms responds, what changes resumes; this is the constant of Qi. Hence it is said, the movements and stillness of heaven and earth are chronicled by the divine; the reciprocal motions of yin and yang reveal the signs of cold and heat; this is what is meant.<a id="trans-522p" href="#orig-522p" class="marker">[522p]</a><br><strong>Five Stars Responding to Change</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: The Master&#39;s words indicate that the seasonal conditions are excessive or insufficient, yet the five stars respond above. In governance by virtue and decree, calamities and changes occur abnormally and have substance. If there is movement suddenly, will it also lead to change? Qi Bo replied: One acts in accord with Heaven, thus there is no reckless movement, and everything responds accordingly. Sudden movements occur due to the intermingling of energies; thus, they do not respond. Therefore, it is said: &quot;Responses are often non-responses to sudden events; this is what is meant.&quot; The Emperor asked: How should one respond? Qi Bo replied: Each follows the transformation of its energy. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How about the speed and direction of actions? Qi Bo replied: By following the way, one remains long, acts with restraint, and takes a minor course; this is called &quot;省下&quot; (perceiving the lower). </p>
<p>Following the way means acting in accordance. Remaining long refers to the days one occupies during the response. &quot;省下&quot; means observing the good and bad of the rulers of the world. </p>
<p>By following the way one departs, quickly returning, curving and passing through, this is called &quot;省遗过&quot; (perceiving and remedying past mistakes).</p>
<p>Remaining long and circling, sometimes departing and sometimes adhering, this refers to discussing disasters alongside virtue. </p>
<p>Responses that are close are minor, while those that are far are major.<a id="trans-523p" href="#orig-523p" class="marker">[523p]</a><br>【Note: The nearby star signifies ongoing troubles, while the distant star denotes past troubles. Large and small represent fortune and misfortune.】 When a star is particularly disturbing, its effects are significant; when there are two signs of disturbance, the misfortune is certain. When there is only one minor disturbance, the effects lessen; when there are two minor disturbances, it refers to observing the mistakes and virtues below. Virtue brings fortune, while mistakes bring punishment, thus the signs are observed. High and distant means minor, low and near means major. Therefore, if the situation is significant, emotions are close; if minor, fortunes and misfortunes are distant. If the annual movement is excessive, the stars move northward. 【Note: &quot;Northward&quot; refers to going against the natural order.】 </p>
<p>When the movements of fortune and luck are aligned, each proceeds according to the way. 【Note: There is no suspicion of punitive actions when maintaining constancy and following the middle path.】 Thus, if the annual movement is excessive, one fears the star losing its brightness and encountering its host. 【Note: Just as when wood is excessive, the star representing earth appears red.】 If it is insufficient, its color merges with that which it cannot conquer. 【Note: For instance, if wood is insufficient, the star for wood appears white. Heavenly energy overcomes its own, and earthly energy overcomes itself. The heavens dictate color and the earth dictates form. When its color merges with what it cannot conquer, it overcomes its own.】 </p>
<p>The Emperor then asked: &quot;How will disasters manifest?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Each will follow its transformation. Thus, when the time arrives, there will be rise and fall, and transgressions will have their reversals and alignments.&quot; 【Note: The time when the five stars shine represents flourishing for kings and ministers, while imprisonment and death represent decline. Moving east signifies alignment, resulting in lesser disasters; moving west signifies opposition, resulting in greater disasters.】 The extent of what remains to be guarded is variable.<a id="trans-524p" href="#orig-524p" class="marker">[524p]</a><br>Notes: When the duration of staying is long, the disaster is severe; when the duration of staying is short, the disaster is mild. </p>
<p>It is evident that there are both good and evil manifestations. </p>
<p>Notes: When the stars are harmonious and moist, it signifies good; when the stars are angry, restless, worried, or grieving, it signifies evil. The twenty-eight constellations and twelve zodiac signs have their victories and defeats; thus, there are auspicious and inauspicious omens. </p>
<p>Notes: Among the twenty-eight constellations and twelve signs, there are interactions of obstruction and nurturing. Different conditions lead to differing fortunes. Therefore, when the five planets encounter obstruction, disasters do not occur. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What do good and evil signify? Qi Bo replied: There is joy and anger, worry and grief, moisture and dryness; these are the common symbols. One must observe them carefully. </p>
<p>Notes: The light and color are round and bright, neither expanding nor contracting, serene and clear; people see it and feel joy; this is the joy of the stars. When the light and color come assertively, bursting forth, overflowing with brilliance; people see it and feel fear; this is the anger of the stars. When the light and color faintly shimmer, appearing and disappearing, this signifies the worry of the stars. When the light and color are markedly different, vague and dull, not bright or clear, not in common with the crowd, this signifies the grief of the stars. Moisture refers to abundance, while dryness pertains to barrenness.<a id="trans-525p" href="#orig-525p" class="marker">[525p]</a><br>The Emperor said: You have spoken fully about the transformations of the five energies and their correspondence with the four seasons. The movement and turmoil of energy can lead to unexpected occurrences, resulting in sudden disasters; how can one anticipate this? Qi Bo replied: Indeed, the movement and changes of energy are not constant, but the virtue of transformation, governance, and decrees concerning disasters can differ according to their characteristics. </p>
<p>In the East, wind arises, giving rise to wood; its virtue is nurturing, its transformation brings prosperity, its governance is expansive, its decree is of wind, its change gives rise to growth, and its disaster scatters. In the South, heat arises, giving rise to fire; its virtue is manifest, its transformation is lush, its governance is bright, its decree is of heat, its change consumes, and its disaster burns. In the Center, moisture arises, giving rise to earth; its virtue is warm and humid, its transformation is abundant, its governance is tranquil, its decree is of moisture, its change pours suddenly, and its disaster brings torrential rain. </p>
<p>In the West, dryness arises, giving rise to metal; its virtue is purity, its transformation is constricting, its governance is vigorous, its decree is of dryness, its change brings harshness, and its disaster is destruction. In the North, cold arises, giving rise to water; its virtue is bleak and profound, its transformation is serene, its governance is solemn, its decree is of cold, its change brings severe frost, and its disaster is ice, snow, and hail. Therefore, when observing these movements, one must consider virtue and transformation, governance and decrees, changes and disasters; thus, things respond accordingly, and people react to them.<a id="trans-526p" href="#orig-526p" class="marker">[526p]</a><br>The emergence of the Five Circulating Energies</p>
<p>The energy of the Five Movements, when excessively confined, ultimately emerges; it waits for the right moment to act, with too much or too little leading to different effects. Excess leads to completion, while deficiency leads to growth. Earth consistently generates life.</p>
<p>When the energy of Earth becomes confined, the mountains and valleys tremble, thunder and atmospheric energy intersect, dust hangs dimly, transforming into white mist that swiftly rises high. It strikes rocks and flies into the sky, causing floods to emerge; rivers flow widely, fields and meadows thrive, and transformative energy is shared, creating timely rain. This marks the beginning of life and growth, as transformations begin to take shape.</p>
<p>Clouds rush to the rain&#39;s center, and rosy clouds embrace the morning sun, while the mountains and marshes are enveloped in dim dust; this is the moment of emergence. With these four energies, clouds traverse the heavens, and the lifecycle of ephemeral beings indicates signs to come.<a id="trans-527p" href="#orig-527p" class="marker">[527p]</a><br>The emergence of golden tranquility brings about clarity in heaven and brightness on earth. The wind is gentle and the atmosphere is vital; in this great coolness, everything comes alive. Grass and trees float in the haze, while dry air moves about, mist and fog arise frequently, and a sense of menace approaches. The vegetation turns green and dry, sound reverberates through the land, mountains and marshes are scorched, and the earth freezes with frost and salt. Hence, the manifestation occurs. Its essence is fivefold. At night, the white dew falls, and the voice of the forest resounds with sorrow, signaling the signs of emergence.</p>
<p>The emergence of water tranquility allows for the dispersal of yang energy, while yin energy violently surges forth. The great cold arrives, and rivers and marshes freeze solid. The cold mist crystallizes into frost and snow, leading to ominous yellow-black darkness. As the energies flow and intersect, it leads to the killing frost. Water reveals auspicious signs, yet sunlight fails to heal; it accumulates in emptiness and deep阴. White dust dims the vision, marking the emergence, its essence twofold associated with fire—before and after. The vast void is deeply fundamental; the energy is like scattered hemp, faintly visible yet hidden. Its color is slightly black with hints of yellow, signaling the signs of emergence.</p>
<p>The emergence of wood tranquility clouded in the vast void stirs the elements. A great wind approaches, causing roofs to splinter and trees to bend, indicating a transformation in wood. The vast void is filled with pale dust, and the skies over the mountains appear uniform in color. There is a muddled atmosphere, yellow and black, accumulating thickly like clouds that rise without rain, marking the signs of emergence.<a id="trans-528p" href="#orig-528p" class="marker">[528p]</a><br>Its energy is unpredictable; the long river flows and the grass lies low, the soft leaves bring shade, the pines sing in the high mountains, and the tigers roar in the rocky cliffs, which are signs of impending distress. </p>
<p>(Note: Trees sprout without a specific time, hence it is said that their energy is unpredictable.) </p>
<p>The fire rises thick, the vast void becomes dim, the great light does not shine, flames spread, the great heat arrives, mountains and marshes burn, timber flows with sap, grand buildings emit smoke, soil floats with frost and brine, stagnant water recedes, creeping weeds turn yellow, winds carry rumors, moisture will then emerge, marking the end of great warmth, sweat moistens the original grounds, thus it arises. Its energy moves in cycles, returning to stillness; when Yang reaches its peak, it turns to Yin, dampness enables transformation and completion, blossoms emerge as water condenses, mountains and rivers freeze with snow, flames heat the midday marshes, which are signs of impending distress. </p>
<p>When there are signs of distress, the response comes afterward; all observations are made at extremes before it arises. Trees sprout without a specific time, water follows fire. </p>
<p>(Note: Water arises around the times before and after fire, just as the stars follow the sun.) </p>
<p>Energy varies in quantity, manifestations can be subtle or intense. Subtle aspects pertain to that energy, while intense aspects encompass what is below. By examining the energy below, it can be understood. </p>
<p>(Note: The five energies transform together; for instance, when water arises, it brings hail and snow, earth awakens to cause rushing winds, trees sprout leading to destruction and breakage, metal manifests as clarity, and fire rises causing dimness, all being responses to the energies below.)<a id="trans-529p" href="#orig-529p" class="marker">[529p]</a><br>Geography and the Factors of High, Low, Left, and Right</p>
<p>The emperor said: When the seasonal energy arrives, it presents characteristics of early and late, high and low, left and right; what are the signs of these phenomena? Qi Bo replied: In movement, there is order and disorder; in arrival, there is delay and quickness. Hence, those who exceed transform according to primordial heaven, while those who do not reach transform according to later heaven. The emperor said: I wish to understand what is meant by their movement. Qi Bo said: The energy of spring moves to the west, summer energy to the north, autumn energy to the east, and winter energy to the south. Thus, spring energy begins below, autumn energy begins above, summer energy begins in the middle, and winter energy begins at the markers; spring energy starts to the left, autumn energy starts to the right, winter energy starts behind, and summer energy starts in front. These are the constant transformations of the four seasons. Therefore, in the highest places, winter energy is ever-present; in the lowest places, spring energy is ever-present.<a id="trans-530p" href="#orig-530p" class="marker">[530p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor asked, &quot;What is the nature of the proper transformations of the six energies and the regulations of their changes?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;The six energies have proper regulations; there are transformations and changes, victories and recoveries, usefulness and ailments, each with its own conditions. The places the energies reach differ: when the Jueyin reaches, it brings harmony; when the Shaoyin reaches, warmth follows; when the Taiyin reaches, dampness appears; when the Shaoyang reaches, heat ensues; when the Yangming reaches, clarity arises; and when the Taiyang reaches, coldness is present. This is the constant change of time. </p>
<p>When the Jueyin reaches, it signifies wind and fluctuations; when the Shaoyin reaches, it denotes nourishment and manifestation; when the Taiyin reaches, it indicates rain and fullness; when the Shaoyang reaches, it represents growth and emergence; when the Yangming reaches, it relates to harvest and dew; and when the Taiyang reaches, it signifies storage and cohesion. This is the constant regulation of transformations. </p>
<p>When the Jueyin reaches, it is life, manifesting like wind swaying; when the Shaoyin reaches, it represents radiance, becoming visible; when the Taiyin reaches, it signifies transformation, like clouds and rain; when the Shaoyang reaches, it denotes longevity and abundance; when the Yangming reaches, it represents gathering, as in mist and dew; and when the Taiyang reaches, it signifies concealment and thoroughness. This is the constant transformation of energies.&quot;<a id="trans-531p" href="#orig-531p" class="marker">[531p]</a><br>When the Jue Yin (Liver) arrives, it produces wind, ultimately leading to dryness; when the Shao Yin (Heart) arrives, it generates heat, which turns into cold; when the Tai Yin (Spleen) arrives, it creates dampness, ultimately resulting in rain; when the Shao Yang (Gallbladder) arrives, it generates fire, which culminates in humidity; when the Yang Ming (Large Intestine) arrives, it produces dryness, ultimately leading to coolness; when the Yang Sun (Bladder) arrives, it generates cold, which mediates warmth; this is the constant of virtue&#39;s transformation. </p>
<p>When the Jue Yin arrives, it leads to hair transformation; when the Shao Yin arrives, it results in feather transformation; when the Tai Yin arrives, it causes naked transformation; when the Shao Yang arrives, it brings about feather transformation; when the Yang Ming arrives, it results in shell transformation; when the Yang Sun arrives, it produces scale transformation; this is the constant of virtue&#39;s transformation. </p>
<p>When the Jue Yin arrives, it brings forth life transformation; when the Shao Yin arrives, it results in flourishing transformation; when the Tai Yin arrives, it creates moistening transformation; when the Shao Yang arrives, it leads to lush transformation; when the Yang Ming arrives, it causes sturdy transformation; when the Yang Sun arrives, it results in storage transformation; this is the regularity of governance.<a id="trans-532p" href="#orig-532p" class="marker">[532p]</a><br>When the Qieyin (Liver) reaches, there will be drifting anger and great coolness. When the Shaoyin (Heart) reaches, there will be great warmth and cold. When the Taiyin (Spleen) reaches, there will be thunder and sudden fierce winds. When the Shaoyang (Gallbladder) reaches, there will be gusty winds and frost condensation. When the Yangming (Stomach) reaches, there will be scattered warmth. When the Taiyang (Bladder) reaches, there will be cold snow, hail, and white dust—these are the usual transformations of qi.</p>
<p>When Qieyin reaches, it causes disturbance and responds with following; when Shaoyin reaches, it brings high bright flames and dusk; when Taiyin reaches, it creates heavy shadows, white dust, and darkness; when Shaoyang reaches, it brings brightness, red clouds, and dusk; when Yangming reaches, it produces smoke, frost, intensity, and wailing; when Taiyang reaches, it brings firmness, hardness, and establishment—all these are the regularities of order.</p>
<p>In all these twelve transformations, virtue is repaid with virtue, and transformation with transformation; governance is repaid with governance, and orders with orders. When qi is high, it is elevated; when qi is low, it is lowered; when qi is behind, it lags; when qi is ahead, it leads; when qi is in the middle, it is centered; when qi is outside, it is outward—these are the constants of position.</p>
<p>In the year of Qieyin in the springs, where the winds are excessive, the earth&#39;s qi is unclear, the plains are murky, and grass sprouts early. When Shaoyin is in the springs and hot winds prevail, flames float over rivers and marshes, and the yin places become clear. When Taiyin is in the springs and dampness prevails, the dust cloaks the rocks and valleys, turning yellow to black. When Shaoyang is in the springs and fire prevails, flames illuminate the fields, bringing alternating cold and heat. When Yangming is in the springs and dryness prevails, mist and fog gather in clear dusk. When Taiyang is in the springs and cold prevails, it brings a chilling solemnity and dread.<a id="trans-533p" href="#orig-533p" class="marker">[533p]</a></p>

<h3>Observations on the Restoration of Celestial Forces</h3>
<p>When the &quot;Lesser Yin&quot; restores, trees fall and sand flies; insects do not flourish.<br>When the &quot;Less Yin&quot; restores, red energy transforms; flowing water does not freeze, warm energy circulates widely, and insects do not return.<br>When the &quot;Great Yin&quot; restores, heavy rains timely arrive; scales are seen upon land.<a id="trans-534p" href="#orig-534p" class="marker">[534p]</a><br>The revival of the Lesser Yang sees great heat approaching, dryness and intensity arise, leading to the consumption by pests. The revival of the Yang Ming brings forth a surge of clear energy, lush trees and green branches emerge, resulting in the flourishing of caterpillars. The revival of the Greater Yang sees water solidifying into rain and ice, causing winged insects to perish.</p>
<p>The text explains: When excess occurs, harm follows; when there is acceptance, control follows, and from control comes transformation. Externally, the order of flourishing and decline reflects harm leading to chaos, and transformation leads to significant illness. This few sentences are often elaborated by earlier scholars, but few truly understand the essence of the text. </p>
<p>To delve into its meaning, it states that excess causes harm, harm leads to chaos, and transformation results in significant illness. Acceptance then brings about control, and control leads to transformation, with external flourishing and decline organized thus. Between heaven and earth, the five types of transformation interact, each overcoming and regulating the others. The terrestrial energy controls its own excess, while celestial energy regulates its own victory, which refers to the control of terrestrial energy over its excess. </p>
<p>The application of the six energies returns to what they cannot overcome to effect transformation: thus, the Greater Yin transforms through rain on the Greater Yang, the Greater Yang transforms coldness into the Lesser Yin, the Lesser Yin transforms heat into the Yang Ming, the Yang Ming transforms dryness into the Lesser Yin, and the Lesser Yin transforms wind into the Greater Yin. </p>
<p>In this realm of the four directions, divided into six phases, it corresponds with the seasonal regulations of the heavens. The energies of heaven and earth alternate in fullness and emptiness; that which cannot be overcome is harmonized, the harmonious flourish, while the discordant decline. When in their rightful places, they flourish; when not, they decline. The terrestrial energy moves inward, while celestial energy moves outward; internally and externally they influence each other, flourishing and declining in reliance, hence the external arrangement of flourishing and decline.<a id="trans-535p" href="#orig-535p" class="marker">[535p]</a><br>If one is overly assertive, it harms oneself; they do not receive the transformations of victory, thus when one has victory, there is also retaliation. Victory and retaliation give rise to further conflict, leading to chaos as a normal cycle. Therefore, when the upper wins, the heavenly energy descends; when the lower wins, the earthly energy ascends. In extreme cases, they may change places, and the exchange of energies results in significant transformations and illnesses. This is what is meant by harm causing defeat and chaos, resulting in significant illness from the processes of transformation. This illustrates the differences between victory and restraint, correctness and change. Hejian observes: Excessiveness harms the nurturing energy, which then leads to control. Thus, one understands that there is non-positioned victory and retaliation that are not restrained, resulting in transformations, while the external listing of flourishing and declining represents the proper transformations of the correct position. The Lou family notes: Fire in excess is harmful, while water nurtures and restrains it. Restraint leads to transformations, peaking in winter. Therefore, the heat of summer brings about the cold transformations of winter, and the cold of winter restrains the heat of summer. Excessiveness may severely disrupt harmony; thus, it is understood that there are proper transformations in the correct position, yet it is unknown that harm leads to defeat and chaos, resulting in significant illness from non-positioned victory and retaliation. How can we then regard the currently excessive discord as the balanced energy that will be controlled in the next days? Little do they realize that the meaning of &quot;excess&quot; and &quot;restraint&quot; is very clear: excess implies a lack of balance, while restraint implies a departure from excess. The flourishing and declining of transformations are the constants of the proper position; the defeat and chaos of transformation are the changes of the non-position. Why then do these two schools fail to distinguish between them?<a id="trans-536p" href="#orig-536p" class="marker">[536p]</a><br>The Mechanisms of Disease in Nineteen Points</p>
<p>Heaven has the five elements corresponding to the five positions, which generate cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind; humans have the five internal organs that transform the five qi, producing joy, anger, worry, thought, and fear. Thus, the qi of the five movements internally corresponds to the five internal organs of a person. All forms of dizziness and disturbances belong to the liver; all cold sensations that draw in belong to the kidneys; all dampness leading to swelling belongs to the spleen; all qi stagnation belongs to the lungs; and all pain, itching, sores, and lesions belong to the heart. All forms of collapse and leakage belong to the lower, referred to as diseases of the lower burner involving the kidneys and liver; all forms of weakness and fullness belong to the upper, referred to as diseases of the upper burner involving the heart and lungs. These are all diseases of the five organs, stemming from internal movements. Heaven’s three yin and three yang transform into six qi, generating cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire, which internally correspond to the six bowels and externally correspond to the twelve meridians.<a id="trans-537p" href="#orig-537p" class="marker">[537p]</a><br>All hot, dizzy, convulsive conditions belong to fire, related to the hand Shaoyang Sanjiao channel; all restrained anxiety and palpitations, resembling a lost spirit, also belong to fire, related to the hand Shaoyin Heart channel; all rebellious counterflows belong to fire, related to the hand Jueyin Pericardium channel; all muscle spasms and stiffness belong to dampness, related to the foot Taiyang Bladder channel; all abdominal bloating belongs to heat, related to the foot Taiyin Spleen channel; all manic and frantic behavior belongs to fire, related to the foot Yangming Stomach channel; all violent rigidity belongs to wind, related to the foot Jueyin Liver channel; all diseases that have sound, like beating a drum, belong to heat, related to the hand Taiyin Lung channel; all swelling and pain in the abdomen, causing fright, belong to fire, related to the hand Yangming Large Intestine channel; all reversals and muddy water liquid belong to heat, related to the hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel; all diseases where water liquid is clear and cold belong to cold, related to the foot Shaoyin Kidney channel; all sour vomiting and sudden downward pressure belong to heat, related to the foot Shaoyang Gallbladder channel. These are all pathogenic conditions of the twelve meridians, arising from external influences. Liu Hejian wrote about this but did not clearly categorize them, lacking in deep analysis. Why? The Lou family only corrected the biases in treatment methods, without addressing this aspect. Thus, I aim to clarify it.<a id="trans-538p" href="#orig-538p" class="marker">[538p]</a><br><strong>Medicine Introduction</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Zhan)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Qi Movement</strong>  </p>
<p>The Supreme Ultimate differentiates into Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang are the principles of Heaven and Earth, the framework of all things, the parents of transformation, the origin of life and death, and the abode of the spiritual and divine.  </p>
<p>The framework refers to the principles of growth, transformation, formation, and collection. The parents refer to the formless state of all things before they take shape. The origin signifies that life and death arise from this. There has never been a thing that has form and essence yet is not governed by the Five Movements, Yin, and Yang. Therefore, the process of creation is boundless and able to be the source of all transformations—why is this so? It is because it is the abode of the spiritual and divine. The convergence and dispersion are unpredictable, and transformations are limitless; this does not imply the omnipotence of the divine is lacking. Hence, the emergence of things is called transformation, the culmination of things is called change, and the unpredictable nature of Yin and Yang is called the divine.<a id="trans-539p" href="#orig-539p" class="marker">[539p]</a><br>Heaven and earth are the foundations of all things; the left and right are the pathways of yin and yang; water and fire are the signs of yin and yang; metal and wood are the beginnings and ends of generation. The interplay of yin, yang, and the five elements flows into the ten stems and five transformations, with the energies of cold, heat, dryness, moisture, wind, and fire circulating between heaven and earth, serving as the origin of all things. Humans draw in this essence yet are confined between the two, hence possessing the five viscera and six bowels to correspond to the cycles of the five movements and six energies. The five movements are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. </p>
<p>[Water is cold and fire is hot, thus serving as signs of yin and yang. Metal cuts down wood, hence marking the beginning and end of generation. Wood indicates that yang energy reaches the ground and brings forth life; fire signifies a destructive force that transforms all things abundantly; metal denotes the constraining of all things and their condensation; water represents the nourishment of all things; earth embodies the containment and release of all things. It brings forth the living and returns the dying.] The six energies are wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness, and cold.</p>
<p>[Each of the six energies has one transformation. Wood transforms into wind, ruling in spring, energizing with yang and serving as heaven’s decree. Fire transforms into heat, ruling in late spring and early summer, following the decree of warmth but not of intense heat, embodying virtue. Corresponding fire transforms into heat, ruling in summer, where intense heat prevails. Metal transforms into dryness, promoting cooling; metal is the wife of fire and therefore dry. Water transforms into cold, bringing severity; earth transforms into moisture, fostering the humid warmth. Moisture causes earth to thrive, while dryness brings death to earth; springs arise from within the earth, affirming the transformation of moisture.] The sage observes the colors of the clouds in the heavens.<a id="trans-540p" href="#orig-540p" class="marker">[540p]</a><br>The air of the black heaven travels through the center, positioned at the place of the Jia and Ji, establishing the earth aspect. The air of the white heaven travels through the west, positioned at the place of Yi and Geng, establishing the metal aspect. The air of the primordial heaven travels through the north, positioned at the place of Bing and Xin, establishing the water aspect. The air of the azure heaven travels through the east, positioned at the place of Ding and Ren, establishing the wood aspect. The air of the red heaven travels through the south, positioned at the place of Wu and Gui, establishing the fire aspect. The colors of these five airs correspond to the twenty-eight lunar mansions above and the twelve divisions below. Thus, when the ancients observed the heavens and sought the airs, they understood precisely the disasters and plagues that should arise in various directions. When divining on the first day of the first lunar month, one should observe in the beginning of the period of Yin if there is excess, in the end of the period of Yin if there is deficiency, and directly during the period of Yin in a balanced state. The azure air represents wind, the red represents heat, the black represents humidity, the white represents dryness, and the black represents cold. If there are overlapping colors of the airs, one must distinguish their subtlety and deduce accordingly.</p>
<p>Heaven takes the movement from the heavenly stems, and the earth takes the khí from the earthly branches. There are ten heavenly stems, which combine to form five aspects; there are twelve earthly branches, which face each other to form six airs. This is because heaven has yin and yang, and the earth also has yin and yang. </p>
<p>Heaven has yin, thus it can descend. The earth has yang, thus it can ascend. </p>
<p>Heaven generates yin through yang, and the earth kills yin and hides it through yang.<a id="trans-541p" href="#orig-541p" class="marker">[541p]</a><br>Those who grow are governed by the Way of Heaven; those who conceal and kill are governed by the Way of Earth. Heaven, being yang, governs growth, thus, yang gives rise to yin; Earth, being yin, governs concealment, thus, yang kills and conceals yin.</p>
<p>There is yang within yin, and yin within yang. In the interchange of qi, for a person, the upper part of the body corresponds to heaven and is governed by heavenly qi; the lower part corresponds to the earth and is governed by earthly qi. The vital essence manifests in five forms, and qi manifests in three. Three manifest in heaven, three manifest in earth, and three manifest in humanity. If three times three, it amounts to nine; hence, there are nine orifices and nine organs corresponding to this.</p>
<p>Heaven has three hundred sixty-five days, and humans have three hundred sixty-five joints. Heaven encompasses the five elements that govern the five positions, giving rise to cold, heat, dryness, humidity, and wind; humans possess five organs that transform into five types of qi, giving rise to joy, anger, thought, worry, and fear. </p>
<p>In heaven, the primordial is present, and the primordial gives rise to the spirit; within humans, the Way exists, and the Way gives rise to wisdom; upon the earth, transformation exists, and transformation gives rise to the five tastes. </p>
<p>The spirit manifests as wind in heaven, as wood on earth, and as anger in humanity. The spirit manifests as heat in heaven, as fire on earth, and as joy in humanity. The spirit manifests as humidity in heaven, as earth on earth, and as thought in humanity. The spirit manifests as dryness in heaven, as metal on earth, and as worry in humanity. The spirit manifests as cold in heaven, as water on earth, and as fear in humanity. </p>
<p>The five qi of cold and heat alternate, each with its precedence. When not in its rightful position, it becomes evil; when in its rightful position, it is proper.<a id="trans-542p" href="#orig-542p" class="marker">[542p]</a><br>The divine entities of Yin and Yang cannot be seen; the traces of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches can be sought. The transformation of heaven and earth is represented not by numbers, but can be measured solely by the Stems and Branches. </p>
<p>The heavenly energy begins with Jia, while the earthly energy begins with Zi; when heaven and earth combine, it forms the Jia Zi. Therefore, Jia Zi is the beginning of the Stems and Branches. The celestial energy concludes with Gui, and the earthly energy concludes with Hai; when heaven and earth combine, it forms Gui Hai, thus Gui Hai is the end of the Stems and Branches. The interplay of Yin and Yang and the mutual dependence of hardness and softness lead to the succession of Yi Chou after Jia Zi, and Gui Hai after Ren Xu. </p>
<p>Thirty years constitute a cycle, while sixty years constitute a complete turn. There are principal motions and guest motions, as well as principal and guest energies. The principal motions and energies remain unchanged for thousands of years; the guest motions and energies, however, shift and change every year. </p>
<p>From the perspective of the order of the celestial stems, Jia and Yi represent the Eastern Wood; Bing and Ding represent the Southern Fire; Wu and Ji represent the Central Earth; Geng and Xin represent the Western Metal; Ren and Gui represent the Northern Water. </p>
<p>Jia is the beginning of the growth of grasses and trees; Yi is when the Yang is still bending. Bing makes all things bright and visible, becoming strong; Ding represents the conflict between strong Yang and Yin energy. Wu is the Yang Earth, from which all things are born; Ji is the Yin Earth, which achieves by doing nothing. Geng represents a renewal of Yang, while Xin represents the peak of Yang followed by transformation.<a id="trans-543p" href="#orig-543p" class="marker">[543p]</a><br>In the ninth month, the Yang energy gives rise to conception, resulting in a fetus, in harmony with the child; the Yin energy is the essence of all things, encapsulating and nurturing life underneath it, sprouting naturally according to the way of Heaven. Therefore, Wood represents the first movement, Fire the second, Earth the third, Metal the fourth, and Water the fifth. This is the principle of movement.</p>
<p>The poem states: In the great cold, the Wood movement begins, before the clear brightness, the Fire movement resides, after the grain harvesting, the Earth movement takes place, after the beginning of autumn, the Metal movement advances, after the beginning of winter, the Water movement lies dormant, cycling endlessly as the years proceed. Someone may ask: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water, rotating leftward in the way of Heaven, are the natural order. However, how can Fire generate Earth, and Earth in turn can generate Fire, and Fire generate Metal? What is the reasoning behind this? It is said: The Furnace Fire cannot exist without Earth; the void does not gather fire. Metal exists in ores, and it cannot be smelted without Fire. Thus, in the &quot;River Diagram,&quot; Fire is located in the West, and Metal in the South, each revealing its potential.</p>
<p>Indeed, the five elements and six energies are ultimately one energy. Therefore, burning Wood turns into Fire; squeezing it turns into Water; striking stone creates Fire, and melting it turns into Water. Within the islets, rivers compete to flow, and in the vast sea, flames continually arise; these are the inherent aspects of nature. Moreover, why doubt the Fire within Earth, and the Metal within Fire?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the couple&#39;s union: Jia merges with Yi to transform into Earth; Yi merges with Geng to transform into Metal; Bing merges with Xin to transform into Water; Ding merges with Ren to transform into Wood; Wu merges with Gui to transform into Fire.<a id="trans-544p" href="#orig-544p" class="marker">[544p]</a><br>In the years of Jia and Ji, the Earth element governs; in the years of Yi and Geng, the Metal element governs; in the years of Bing and Xin, the Water element governs; in the years of Ding and Ren, the Wood element governs; in the years of Wu and Gui, the Fire element governs. This is the flow of fortune. </p>
<p>The poem states: &quot;In the years of Jia and Ji, Earth transforms; in the years of Yi and Geng, Metal is secured; in the years of Bing and Xin, flowing Water abounds; in the years of Ding and Ren, Wood flourishes. The years of Wu and Gui, known as the Heart, signify departure.&quot; </p>
<p>The year of Jia and Ji begins in the first month with Bing Yin, where Bing Fire generates Earth, thus it is the Earth element. The year of Yi and Geng begins in the first month with Wu Yin, where Wu Earth generates Metal, thus it is the Metal element. The year of Bing and Xin begins in the first month with Geng Yin, where Geng Metal is paired with Water, thus it is the Water element. The year of Ding and Ren begins in the first month with Ren Yin, where Ren Water generates Wood, thus it is the Wood element. The year of Wu and Gui begins in the first month with Jia Yin, where Jia Wood generates Fire, thus it is the Fire element. </p>
<p>Assuming Jia and Ji denote that the year of Jia implies the fortune of Earth, hence the initial fortune is Earth. Earth generates Metal, therefore the second fortune is Metal. Metal generates Water, thus the third fortune is Water. Water generates Wood, leading to the fourth fortune as Wood. Wood generates Fire, marking the fifth fortune as Fire. Each fortune governs for seventy-two days and five periods. This heavenly stem, being above, influences fortunes. </p>
<p>Additionally, considered by the cycle of earthly branches: Yin and Mao belong to Spring, representing Wood. </p>
<p>Yin signifies expansion. In the first month, Yang ascends and Yin descends, controlling the flying ash to signal the beginning of expansion. Mao signifies flourishing; in the second month, the Yang energy is strong and thrives. </p>
<p>Si and Wu belong to Summer, representing Fire.<a id="trans-545p" href="#orig-545p" class="marker">[545p]</a><br>The &quot;Yes&quot; signifies rise; in April, the正阳 (pure yang) is without yin, and all things complete and rise. The &quot;Wu&quot; symbolizes growth; in May, the yang is not yet waning, yin begins to manifest as the principal force, and all things grow large.</p>
<p>The &quot;Chen&quot; symbolizes震 (shaking), as the three yangs have surpassed their midpoint; all things tremble and grow. The &quot;Xu&quot; signifies demise; in September, all things decline and perish. The &quot;Chou&quot; symbolizes binding; yin still binds things together, marking the end of December. The &quot;Wei&quot; symbolizes flavor; in June, the things mature, gaining flavor.</p>
<p>The &quot;Shen&quot; symbolizes the body; in July, all things are fully formed. The &quot;You&quot; signifies convergence; in August, all things retract and consolidate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Hai&quot; symbolizes harm; in October, the yin energy harms all things, which is the principle of this place. The &quot;Zi&quot; represents cold water in the north, the position of yin; the beginning of the emergence of yang, thus when yin reaches its peak, yang is born, becoming a fetus, marking November.</p>
<p>Therefore, wind corresponds to the initiating energy, fire to the second energy, heat to the third energy, dampness to the fourth energy, dryness to the fifth energy, and cold to the concluding energy; these are the governing energies. </p>
<p>The poem states: &quot;In the Great Cold, the initial energy of厥阴; at Spring Equinox, the君火 at the second corner. In Lesser Fullness, the 少阳 divides the third energy; in Major Heat, the 太阴 calls the four aspects. At Autumn Equinox, the 阳明 corresponds to the fifth position; in Light Snow, the 太阳 is the sixth remainder.&quot;<a id="trans-546p" href="#orig-546p" class="marker">[546p]</a><br>From the perspective of their oppositional positions: the Child (Zi) is countered by the Noon (Wu) and is thus the Minor Yin Lord Fire; the Ox (Chou) counters the Shepherd&#39;s Dog (Wei) and is the Major Yin Moist Earth; the Tiger (Yin) counters the Monkey (Shen) and represents the Minor Yang Corresponding Fire, while the Rooster (You) corresponds with the Bright Yang Dry Metal; the Dragon (Chen) counters the Dog (Xu) and symbolizes the Major Yang Cold Water; the Snake (Si) counters the Pig (Hai) and represents the Reckless Yin Wind Wood.</p>
<p>The Lord Fire governs at Noon, and Fire is inherently hot, yet its energy is at the position of Noon, the initial stage of Yin&#39;s birth, hence it marks coldness and belongs to the Minor Yin. Water resides in the North, with the Child position being Water, inherently cold, yet its energy is at the initial stage of Yang&#39;s birth, thus it marks warmth and belongs to the Major Yang. Earth corresponds to Late Summer, with the position of Wei, which is next to Wu, hence it is said that Major Yin Corresponding Fire governs in the Tiger position, which is next to the Ox. Therefore, it is said to be Minor Yang Wood, which resides in the Eastern Thunder area, under the diaphragm of the human master’s liver. Yin Wood must wait for Yin before it can grow, thus it belongs to the Reckless Yin. Metal resides in the Western Marsh, in the lungs of the human master, and sits above the diaphragm. Yang Metal must wait for Yang before it can emerge, thus it belongs to the Bright Yang.<a id="trans-547p" href="#orig-547p" class="marker">[547p]</a><br>Therefore, in the years of Zi and Wu, the ruling element is fire; in the years of Chou and Wei, it is moist earth; in the years of Yin and Shen, it is the fire of the phase; in the years of Mao and You, it is dry metal; in the years of Chen and Xu, it is cold water; in the years of Si and Hai, it is wind wood. This is the energy of guests.</p>
<p>The poem states: &quot;In the years of Zi and Wu, the lesser yin rules the fire of heaven; the greater yang, the dry metal, corresponds to the spring. In the years of Chou and Wei, the greater yin rests on the moist earth; the sun&#39;s cold water brings continuous rain. In the years of Yin and Shen, the lesser yang flourishes in its fiery strength; the phase of wind wood is connected in the earth below. The years of Mao and You are contrary to those of Zi and Wu; the years of Chen and Xu and the years of Si and Hai follow the same pattern. If the years of Mao and You preside over heaven, then the years of Zi and Wu are found in the spring; if the years of Mao and You are at the spring, then the years of Zi and Wu preside over heaven. The years of Chen and Xu follow the example of Chou and Wei; the years of Si and Hai follow the example of Yin and Shen.&quot;<a id="trans-548p" href="#orig-548p" class="marker">[548p]</a><br>If the Celestial Fire of Shaoyin is in the position of Ziwu, and the Dry Metal of Yangming is in the position of Wu; the former moves right, with the Wet Earth of Taiyin on the left side of heaven, and the Wind Wood of Jueyin on the right side of heaven, thus facing south and designating its position. The latter moves left, with the Cold Water of Taiyang on the left side of the earth, and the Rising Fire of Shaoyang on the right side of the earth, thus facing north and designating its position. The upper qi governs the sky of one year and presides over the first half of the year, while the lower qi governs the earth of one year and presides over the second half of the year. There are two qi on the left and two qi on the right, governing humanity and all things. The left side of the earth corresponds to the initial qi. Key insight: Each year retreating by two signifies the guest&#39;s dwelling. For instance, if Zi governs the sky, the two subsequent branches, Xu and Yin, signify the initial qi; Hai represents the second qi, Zi represents the third qi, Chou represents the fourth qi, Yin represents the fifth qi, and Yin represents the sixth qi. Furthermore, the yearly and daily positions are all designated as governing the sky.<a id="trans-549p" href="#orig-549p" class="marker">[549p]</a><br>In the right sector of heaven is the energy of two; in the control of heaven is the energy of three; in the left sector of heaven is the energy of four; in the right sector of earth is the energy of five; and in the control of earth is the energy of ending. Each energy governs for sixty days and eighty-seven and a half moments, with a peculiar occurrence.</p>
<p>In the year of the Rabbit and Rooster, the Yangming governs heaven, while the Taiyin is at the spring. The initial energy is the Taiyin, the second energy is the Shaoyang, the third energy is the Yangming, the fourth energy is the Taiyang, the fifth energy is the Jueyin, and the sixth energy is the Shaoyin. </p>
<p>In the year of the Dragon and Dog, the Taiyang governs heaven, while the Taiyin is at the spring. The initial energy is the Shaoyang, the second energy is the Yangming, the third energy is the Taiyang, the fourth energy is the Jueyin, the fifth energy is the Shaoyin, and the sixth energy is the Taiyin. </p>
<p>In the year of the Ox and Goat, the Taiyin governs heaven, while the Taiyang is at the spring. The initial energy is the Jueyin, the second energy is the Shaoyin, the third energy is the Taiyin, the fourth energy is the Shaoyang, the fifth energy is the Yangming, and the sixth energy is the Taiyang.<a id="trans-550p" href="#orig-550p" class="marker">[550p]</a><br>In the Year of the Tiger and Monkey, the Lesser Yang governs Heaven, and the Absolute Yin dwells in the springs. The initial qi is the Lesser Yin, the second qi is the Greater Yin, the third qi is the Lesser Yang, the fourth qi is the Yang Ming, the fifth qi is the Greater Yang, and the sixth qi is the Absolute Yin. In the Year of the Snake and Pig, the Absolute Yin governs Heaven, and the Lesser Yang dwells in the springs. The initial qi is the Yang Ming, the second qi is the Greater Yang, the third qi is the Absolute Yin, the fourth qi is the Lesser Yin, the fifth qi is the Greater Yin, and the sixth qi is the Lesser Yang. </p>
<p>Here, the Earthly Branches are below and thus represent Yin, which governs the qi. However, the flow of guest currents may be excessive or insufficient. In years of excess, the heavenly stems are Jia, Bing, Wu, Geng, and Ren, all five are Yang. In years of insufficiency, the heavenly stems are Yi, Ding, Ji, Xin, and Gui, all five are Yin. The peak of excess arrives first, thirteen days before the Great Cold, known as the Former Heaven. The peak of insufficiency arrives later, thirteen days after the Great Cold, known as the Latter Heaven. In years of balanced qi, it coincides precisely with the day of the Great Cold, neither early nor late, known as the Equal Heaven.<a id="trans-551p" href="#orig-551p" class="marker">[551p]</a><br>In the year of Shenzi and the hour of Hares, on the day of Great Cold, at the first moment of the tiger, is the onset of the initial qi; on the day of Spring Equinox, at the end of the hour of the rat, is the transition to the second qi; on the day of Minor Fullness, at the end of the hour of the pig, is the transition to the third qi; on the day of Major Heat, at the end of the hour of the dog, is the transition to the fourth qi; on the day of Autumn Equinox, at the end of the hour of the rooster, is the transition to the fifth qi; on the day of Minor Snow, at the end of the hour of the monkey, is the transition to the final qi. This is referred to as the first six heavens. </p>
<p>In the year of Siyouchou, on the day of Great Cold, at the first moment of the snake, is the onset of the initial qi; on the day of Spring Equinox, at the end of the hour of the rabbit, is the transition to the second qi; on the day of Minor Fullness, at the end of the hour of the tiger, is the transition to the third qi; on the day of Major Heat, at the end of the hour of the ox, is the transition to the fourth qi; on the day of Autumn Equinox, at the end of the hour of the rat, is the transition to the fifth qi; on the day of Minor Snow, at the end of the hour of the pig, is the transition to the final qi.

This is referred to as the &quot;Three-Six Days.&quot;</p>
<p>In the years of Hai, Mao, and Wei, at the beginning of the great cold on the first moment of the twelfth watch, the initial qi transitions; at the end of the tenth watch on the spring equinox, the second qi transitions; at the end of the ninth watch on the minor fullness, the third qi transitions; at the end of the eighth watch on the great heat, the fourth qi transitions; at the end of the seventh watch on the autumn equinox, the fifth qi transitions; at the end of the sixth watch on minor snow, the final qi transitions. This is referred to as the &quot;Four-Six Days.&quot;</p>
<p>As for the rise and fall of guest qi, there exists both Zheng transformation and Dui transformation. The years of Zheng transformation are those of Wu, Wei, Yin, You, Chen, and Hai. The years of Dui transformation are those of Zi, Chou, Shen, Mao, Xu, and Si. The Zheng transformation signifies substantiality, based on the essence, manifesting in numbers; the Dui transformation signifies insubstantiality, based on the symbol, completing in numbers.</p>
<p>Water is one, fire is two, wood is three, metal is four, earth is five, all matched according to yin and yang.<a id="trans-553p" href="#orig-553p" class="marker">[553p]</a><br>If we examine its profound significance, water originates from the One, when heaven and earth were not yet separated and all things had not yet come into being. Everything is seen first in water; thus, the seeds of plants and the embryos of creatures, although not yet formed, are all associated with water. When water gathers, it takes on forms and qualities, embodying both yin and yang, and only then do things come into existence. Therefore, those things that are small and bitter signify fire. When things are ripe, they are sweet, which is the flavor of earth. When sweetness reaches its extreme, it turns bland, returning to the original state. Humans, endowed with yin and yang, are first formed with two kidneys. Although the seeds and fruits of plants vary in size, they all contain a duality that unites, resembling the kidneys in humans. Thus, without the union of yin and yang, all things cannot transform and arise; hence, fire is mentioned second. Once yin and yang unite, there is spring birth and autumn maturity; therefore, wood is mentioned third, and metal fourth. Wood, fire, metal, and water all come into being due to earth; thus, earth is mentioned fifth.<a id="trans-554p" href="#orig-554p" class="marker">[554p]</a><br>Three Yin and Three Yang, the true transformations proceed from the original life numbers, while the transformed ones follow the derived life numbers. For example, in the Year of the Wood Rat, Wood represents the Earth element and governs the year, while Rat signifies the Fire element, presiding over one year. A complete cycle lasts three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five moments, which corresponds precisely to one three hundred sixty-five degrees and one-fourth of a degree of the celestial sphere. The celestial sphere refers to the heavens surrounding the position of the Earth, distinct from the sixqi of the celestial sphere. The celestial body is perfectly round, with a circumference of three hundred sixty-five degrees and one-fourth of a degree. The heavens operate robustly, completing one rotation in one day and night, which exactly matches three hundred sixty-five degrees and one-fourth of a degree. If the heavens advance by an additional degree, then the sun retreats by one degree; if in two days the heavens advance by two degrees, then the sun retreats by two degrees.<a id="trans-555p" href="#orig-555p" class="marker">[555p]</a><br>When the accumulation reaches three hundred sixty-five days and one-fourth of a day, the progression of the heavens corresponds to its original measure, and the regression of the sun also corresponds precisely to its original measure. Thus, they converge to complete a year, which is called one year and one revolution of the heavens. </p>
<p>The moon moves slowly, traveling one day and one night through three hundred sixty-five degrees and one-fourth of a degree, not completing its course. Compared to the heavens, it falls behind by thirteen degrees, reaching about twenty-nine and a half days, coinciding perfectly with the heavens at the right moment, which is called one month and one revolution of the heavens.</p>
<p>Five days constitute one phase, and three phases make up one &quot;qi,&quot; equating to fifteen days. Three &quot;qi&quot; form one season, with the eight seasons being the Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, and Winter Solstice. </p>
<p>There are twenty-four &quot;qi&quot; in total, divided into four seasons, completing a year. The terms used in Spring and Autumn concerning division signify the balance of yin and yang, as their qualities differ. The terms used in Winter and Summer concerning arrival indicate the culmination of yin and yang, as their qualities are similar.<a id="trans-556p" href="#orig-556p" class="marker">[556p]</a><br>The heavens do not have seasons by themselves; rather, the phenomena of wind, rain, frost, and dew in trees and grass follow a timetable that can be verified and measured, hence they are called seasonal markers. Referring to a seasonal marker day, it corresponds to the five phases interacting with one another, equating to five days. The text states: the period consists of three hundred and sixty ten-day cycles, with six extra days, determined by leap months to establish the four seasons within a year, which embodies this meaning.</p>
<p>Within a single cycle, the principal energy resides in its position, while the secondary energy follows below; the guest energy operates above, and cycles through. The guest energy, when added to the principal energy, combines with the primary energy that acts over the guest energy. This discrepancy in celestial timing leads to the ailments among the people.</p>
<p>In the year of Chen and Xu, the initial guest energy of lesser yang fire adds to the primary energy of the supreme yin wood; the second guest energy of yang brightness metal adds to the primary energy of lesser yin fire; the third guest energy of greater yin water adds to the primary energy of lesser yang fire; the fourth guest energy of supreme yin wood adds to the primary energy of greater yin earth; the fifth guest energy of lesser yin fire adds to the primary energy of bright metal; the concluding guest energy of greater yin earth adds to the primary energy of greater yang water.<a id="trans-557p" href="#orig-557p" class="marker">[557p]</a><br>The above concerns the influence of external factors on the primary conditions, using these past two years as examples. Discussing the primary elements: in spring, there is warmth; in summer, heat; in autumn, coolness; and in winter, coldness. Wind causes movement, fire provides warmth, heat brings humidity, moisture offers nourishment, dryness causes aridity, and coldness creates solidity—all are manifestations of the proper flow of the universe&#39;s vital forces. However, when external influences overpower the primary elements, adverse conditions arise: spring brings chilling winds, summer experiences oppressive gloom, autumn suffers from persistent rain, and winter faces unwelcome sunshine. When wind prevails, the land shakes; when fire dominates, the earth becomes solid; when heat overpowers, the ground becomes scorching; when moisture prevails, the soil turns muddy; when dryness wins, the land dries up; and when cold prevails, the earth fractures. Uneven climates lead to the emergence of diseases at certain times. In the sixth year of the cycle, when the earth’s energy is excessive, humidity increases, resulting in illnesses linked to dampness. Thus, treatment should focus on eliminating moisture to strengthen the kidneys.<a id="trans-558p" href="#orig-558p" class="marker">[558p]</a><br>In the year of the Six Ji, if the earth&#39;s influence is insufficient, then the wood energy flourishes, leading to the appearance of wind and subsequent wind diseases. Treatment should focus on the spleen to balance the wood. </p>
<p>In the year of the Six Bing, if the water&#39;s influence is excessive, then the cold energy prevails, resulting in cold diseases. The heart fire is affected by pathogens, and treatment should involve expelling the cold to nourish the heart.</p>
<p>In the year of the Six Xin, if the water&#39;s influence is insufficient, then the earth energy thrives, leading to dampness, which causes damp-related diseases. Treatment should focus on nourishing the kidneys to eliminate dampness.</p>
<p>In the year of the Six Wu, if the fire&#39;s influence is excessive, then the hot energy prevails, resulting in heat-related diseases. The lung metal is afflicted by pathogens, and treatment should involve reducing heat to nourish the lungs.</p>
<p>In the year of the Six Gui, if the fire&#39;s influence is insufficient, then the water energy flourishes, leading to coldness, which causes cold diseases. Treatment should focus on nourishing the heart to expel the cold.</p>
<p>In the year of the Six Geng, if the metal&#39;s influence is excessive, then dryness spreads, leading to dry-related diseases. The liver wood is affected by pathogens, and treatment should involve clearing dryness to nourish the liver.</p>
<p>In the year of the Six Yi, if the metal&#39;s influence is insufficient, then the fire energy flourishes, leading to heat conversion, which causes heat-related diseases. Treatment should focus on clearing the lungs to reduce heat.<a id="trans-559p" href="#orig-559p" class="marker">[559p]</a><br>In the year of Liu Ren, when the Wood element is overly strong, the winds become prevalent, leading to the emergence of wind diseases. The Spleen is then afflicted by evil influences, and treatment should focus on balancing the Wood to supplement the Spleen. In the year of Liu Ding, when Wood is insufficient, the Metal element becomes dominant, resulting in dryness manifesting as dry diseases. Treatment should aim to nourish the Liver to clear the dryness. This is the method of treating guest elements.</p>
<p>For the Yang Sun&#39;s cold Water, treatment should favor warm spicy herbs; for the Yang Ming&#39;s dry Metal, treatment should favor bitter warm herbs; for the Shao Yang&#39;s Fire, treatment should be cool and salty; for the Tai Yin&#39;s moist Earth, treatment should be hot and bitter; for the Shao Yin&#39;s ruling Fire, treatment should be cool and salty; for the Jue Yin&#39;s Wind Wood, treatment should be cool and spicy. This outlines the methods of treating the six qi.</p>
<p>However, the reason for the changes in the elemental cycles is that qi harmonizes when compatible and leads to disease when incompatible. Moreover, there can be cases of compatibility still resulting in sickness due to the misplacement of influences from above to below. The mutual generation of the five elements signifies compatibility, while their mutual overcoming indicates incompatibility. When an influence from above descends to below, it is considered harmonious; when below influences above, it is considered adverse.<a id="trans-560p" href="#orig-560p" class="marker">[560p]</a><br>If earth is on top of fire, fire on top of wood, wood on top of water, water on top of metal, and metal on top of earth, all are instances of what is beneath improperly dominating what is above. In the relationship between father and son, the son is below and the father is above; to have the son dominate the father is indeed contrary to this principle. </p>
<p>When the celestial authority harmonizes with the current, it is considered to be in accordance with nature; when the current overcomes the celestial authority, it is contrary. When the vital energy overcomes the current, it is in accordance; when the current overcomes the vital energy, it is contrary. When the current and the vital energy are the same, it is called a heavenly symbol.</p>
<p>In the years of Wu Zi, Wu Wu, Wu Yin, and Wu Shen, the current and vital energy are all fire. In the years of Bing Chen and Bing Xu, they are all water. In the years of Ji Chou and Ji Wei, they are all earth. In the years of Yi Mao and Yi You, they are all metal. In the years of Ding Si and Ding Hai, they are all wood. Among the sixty years, there are these twelve years that are heavenly symbols. Additionally, on the day of Wu Zi, Wu represents the fire current, and Zi represents the subordinate Yin lord fire overseeing the heavens. Since the current and the celestial authority are both fire, this is a heavenly symbol; on this day, illnesses arise quickly and are grave and concerning. Moreover, encountering the Tai Sui of that year is also a heavenly symbol; if it coincides with the year&#39;s assembly, the illness is especially burdensome.</p>
<p>Heavenly energy giving birth to the current is called harmonious transformation.<a id="trans-561p" href="#orig-561p" class="marker">[561p]</a><br>In the years of Jiazi, Jiayin, Jiayin, and Jiashen, fire generates earth.

In the years of Guisi and Guihai, wood generates fire. Within sixty years, there are these twelve years of harmonious transformation. The concept of “Heavenly Punishment” refers to weather overcoming fate.</p>
<p>In the years of Gengzi, Gengwu, Gengyin, and Gengshen, fire overcomes metal. In the years of Wuchen and Wuxu, water overcomes fire. In the years of Xinchou and Ximai, earth overcomes water.

In the years of Jiyin and Jiyou, earth generates gold. In the years of Xinsi and Xinwei, water generates wood. When the child assumes the father&#39;s position, it is not in accordance with reason; within sixty years, there are these twelve years of small reversal.

In the years of Jisi and Jihai, metal overcomes wood. Within the sixty years, there are these twelve years of discord.</p>
<p>When the wood element is in position, it is called the annual meeting.</p>
<p>Zi corresponds to water, and in the year of Bingzi, the water element is dominant. Wu corresponds to fire, and in the year of Wuwu, the fire element is dominant. Mao corresponds to wood, and in the year of Dingmao, the wood element is dominant. You corresponds to metal, and in the year of Yiyou, the metal element is dominant. The positions of Chen and Xu, and Chou and Wei correspond to earth, with Jiachen, Jiaxu, Jichou, and Jiwei being years when the earth element is dominant. Within the sixty years, there are these eight years of annual meetings. Furthermore, on the day of Bingzi, Bing represents the water element, and Zi is the water branch; thus, the element and the branch align in water, leading to the term &#39;annual meeting.&#39; If one falls ill on this day, they do not die but must manage their condition carefully. Moreover, if the year, month, day, and time coincide with this meeting and align with the heavenly symbol, the illness becomes significantly worse. The convergence of the heavenly symbol and the annual meeting is called the Great One Heavenly Symbol.<a id="trans-563p" href="#orig-563p" class="marker">[563p]</a><br>In the years Wu Wu, Yi You, Ji Wei, and Ji Chou, there are these four years of the Taiyi Heavenly Talismans in a sixty-year cycle. Furthermore, on the day of Wu Wu, Wu represents the fire element, and Wu is the lord of the fire aspect of the Shaoyin, while Wu also belongs to the fire branch. Hence, it is called the Taiyi Heavenly Talisman. A disease occurring on this day indicates death. The fortune matches with the four Meng months, referred to as the Zhide Talisman.</p>
<p>The Yin branch belongs to wood and corresponds to the Mengchun month; the Ren Yin year sees the arrival of the wood fortune. The Si branch belongs to fire and corresponds to the Mengxia month; the Gui Si year sees the arrival of the fire fortune. The Shen branch belongs to metal and corresponds to the Mengqiu month; the Geng Shen year sees the arrival of the metal fortune. The Hai branch belongs to water and corresponds to the Mengdong month; the Xin Hai year sees the arrival of the water fortune. In the sixty-year cycle, there are these four years of the Zhide Talisman. The fortune pairing with the intersecting days is referred to as the Gande Talisman.</p>
<p>Jia and Ji combine, Yi and Geng combine, Bing and Xin combine, Ding and Ren combine, Wu and Gui combine; encountering these pairs in one year, where Heaven and Earth join in harmony, represents a year of good fortune. Excessive fortunes combined with earthly energy are referred to as the Tongtian Talisman.</p>
<p>In the years Geng Zi and Geng Wu, the fortunes unite under dry metal; in the years Ren Yin and Ren Shen, the fortunes unite under wind wood; in the years Jia Chen and Jia Xu, the fortunes unite under wet earth. Within the sixty years, there are these six years of the Tongtian Talisman. Insufficient fortunes combined with earthly energy are referred to as the Tongsui Meeting.<a id="trans-564p" href="#orig-564p" class="marker">[564p]</a><br>In the years of Xin Chou and Xin Wei, the运 (Yun) of cold water affects the position of the Earth; in the years of Gui Mao and Gui You, the运 (Yun) of ruling fire affects the position of the Earth; in the years of Gui Si and Gui Hai, the运 (Yun) of mutual fire affects the position of the Earth. Among sixty years, these six years have the same significance. </p>
<p>Main Idea: In yang years, the pre-heaven transformation occurs first, resulting in a strong self that overcomes the substantial, which signifies victory over the other, thus the defeated will suffer from evils. In yin years, the post-heaven transformation occurs, leading to a weak self that experiences declining energy, leading to the other overcoming the self, thus the one that prevails over the self arrives to conquer, and after being conquered, must wait for the right time to recover. When recovering from that which has been conquered, the self cannot advance; thus, one must wait until the right time arrives, then the child will flourish, and then the child will restore the cycle. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it states that in excessively yang years, one transgresses that which cannot be defeated and takes control over that which is overcome; in insufficient yin years, the one that prevails acts recklessly and thus suffers the consequences. For example, if liver wood is excessive, it signifies strong qi at that time, which weakens lung metal while dominating spleen earth; if liver wood is insufficient, earth has nothing to fear, thus acting recklessly and dominating kidney water, illustrating the principle of generation and overcoming in the five elements. Therefore, when victory reaches, recovery occurs; after recovery, the victory happens, which leads to irregular qi that does not cease. If one recovers but does not prevail, it means the vital essence has been harmed and there is an end to it.</p>
<p>The classic states: Excess leads to harm; reception leads to control; control leads to transformation. Externally, the rise and fall is listed; harm leads to disorder, and transformation leads to major diseases. </p>
<p>Excess is to go beyond the limit and not retreat. Failing to retreat when one should, initially brings disaster to others, and ultimately brings disaster upon oneself. Reception implies following; serving below while protecting above carries the meaning of defense.<a id="trans-565p" href="#orig-565p" class="marker">[565p]</a><br>Control masters victory; through control, transformation occurs. When there is governance, the six energies do not become excessive, leading to balance. In balance, all things arise and undergo endless changes. The act of being originates from non-being, while transformation arises from being but can lead to non-being. The external display of prosperity and decline is governed by the distribution of the six energies, which alternate between abundance and scarcity. If there is harm without governance, it will result in the collapse and disorder of governance, causing disaster and transformation, leading to the great calamity of all things. This great calamity refers to disasters and changes. When all things are afflicted, can heaven and earth still maintain their positions? This excessive harm stems from control, which is unavoidable and inevitable. Taking the timing of heaven into account, if spring does not yield to the winter&#39;s decree, then water becomes excessively dominant, harming the wood it supports. However, fire, being the child of wood, then utilizes earth to control water, allowing wood to receive the mandate of transformation and display its beauty and splendor outwardly.<a id="trans-566p" href="#orig-566p" class="marker">[566p]</a><br>However, plants and insects have their own cycles of growth and decline each year. If there is no regulation and the trees suffer harm, then winter will enter spring prematurely, causing life to wither and resulting in disasters between heaven and earth. Could this not be the utmost chaos of governance? Speaking in terms of the human body, when the heart fire is excessive, the mouth becomes dry and parched, and the body overheats. Consequently, the spleen loses nourishment, the lung suffers damage from the metal element, and from this, water rises to counter the fire of the heart. Sweating releases moisture, cooling the mouth and body, bringing balance. If the kidney water is too weak to ascend and regulate, and the heart fire is too strong to descend, then spirit departs, qi becomes solitary, and disasters ensue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said: When there is surplus, it should not be squandered; when there is deficiency, one should remain steady. Knowing when to welcome and when to follow, qi can be anticipated.</p>
<p>This expresses that when there is surplus, there will subsequently be deficiency; when there is deficiency, there will subsequently be surplus. If surplus follows surplus and scarcity follows scarcity, then the principles of heaven and earth are altered.</p>
<p>Again, it is said: When the entering and exiting are neglected, the spirit’s mechanisms are extinguished; when ascension and descent cease, the qi becomes isolated and precarious.<a id="trans-567p" href="#orig-567p" class="marker">[567p]</a><br>Therefore, without entrance and exit, there would be no growth, aging, and death; without rising and falling, there would be no development, transformation, and storage. Thus, rising and falling, entrance and exit, are present in all things. If these four are not maintained, disaster will come. </p>
<p>Entrance and exit are the breathing of heaven and earth. Rising and falling are the transformative energies of heaven and earth. Beasts with fur and feathers, and creatures that fly or crawl, all derive their life force from within, with the spirit acting as the master of movement and stillness—hence it is called the spirit mechanism. Gold, jade, earth, stones, plants, and trees all derive their life force from the external, depending on atmosphere to establish themselves—thus it is called the establishment of atmosphere. Those that originate within are rooted in the heavens, and all their movements are driven by the spirit energy as the master of mechanism. What they do is unknown to all beings; therefore, when the spirit departs, the mechanism rests.<a id="trans-568p" href="#orig-568p" class="marker">[568p]</a><br>Those that are rooted in the external world are dependent on the earth for their birth and growth. Thus, their processes of growth, transformation, and storage all arise from the vital essence of nature. Therefore, what emerges from them is unknown to all beings. When the vital essence ceases, the path of creation is cut off. The nine orifices that are horizontal all possess the air of entry and exit. The vertical orifices have the air of yin and yang, rising and falling. The interactions within, along with walls, windows, and openings, all receive the incoming air that strikes us. When yang rises, the well is cold; when yin rises, the well is warm. When objects are thrown into the well and leaves fall from above, tumbling without haste, this is all due to the condensation of yin energy. </p>
<p>The hollow tube holds water completely; if earth is suspended, the water cannot flow out because there is no rising air to facilitate descent. A small-mouthed empty bottle, when poured into suddenly, does not allow liquid in, because the air cannot escape—so it cannot enter. From this, we observe that rise contains no limit to descent, and descent contains no limit to rise. Without exiting, there is no entering; without entering, there is no exiting. The birth of all things involves the cycles of rising, falling, entering, and exiting—this is the constant principle of vital energy.<a id="trans-569p" href="#orig-569p" class="marker">[569p]</a><br>If there is exit without entry, entry without exit, ascent without descent, and descent without ascent, then it contradicts the constant way of transformation, and the spirit departs while the energy is solitary—what could this be but disaster? However, both reversals and smoothness, all are manifestations of celestial energy. The earth is below man, upheld by the great atmosphere. Heaven moves six times and does not rest, while the earth is stable in its five positions. </p>
<p>Heaven uses six energies to influence the earth, and the earth, with its five positions, receives heaven. Yet, if the heavenly fire does not augment the lord’s fire, adding six to five results in one excess energy after five years; hence the lord’s fire is not suitable for seasonal energy but is merely a designation following heaven. Therefore, it is said that the lord&#39;s fire is based on name, while the fiery energy is based on position; this means that the fiery energy replaces the lord&#39;s fire in function, leading to its migration after five years. If the earth supports six with five, then after six years the celestial source energy is fully prepared, thus completing six cycles, repeating and renewing continuously.<a id="trans-570p" href="#orig-570p" class="marker">[570p]</a><br>At five years, the energies of the five elements circulate; at six years, the positions of the six energies complete their cycle. The combination of five and six means that at thirty years, a cycle begins, resulting in sixty years. By examining the calendar days and the transformation of seasons, each year is governed by a dominant energy, referred to as the earth energy. If the heavenly officer is positioned between the springs on either side, moving and residing above the dominant energy, it is called the heavenly energy, which is secondary. The secondary energy follows the heavenly decree throughout the year, while the dominant energy merely serves the secondary energy. If the secondary energy prevails, one follows; if the dominant energy prevails, one resists. There can be a victory of one over the other, but no return.</p>
<p>When the dominant prevails, it diminishes the dominant energy and replenishes the secondary; when the secondary prevails, it diminishes the secondary and replenishes the dominant. The classics state: First, establish the year to clarify its energy. Each year, establish the movement of energies, examine their excesses and deficiencies, then use the dominant energy of the earth as the foundation, while the incoming heavenly energy serves as the marker, in pursuit of the six transformations. As the energies fluctuate, the subtle follows, and the intense is constrained.<a id="trans-571p" href="#orig-571p" class="marker">[571p]</a><br>The restoration of qi involves harmonizing what is passive and grasping what is aggressive. Each follows the victorious qi to find its balance, aiming for equilibrium. Moreover, examining the teachings of the Zhu family, it is said that the Great Disturbance generates the Jiazi, and the initiated heads operate by numerical principles, marking the distance of time and seasons. Therefore, the current year is identified as the Jiazi year, the Winter Solstice is the Jiazi month, the New Moon is the Jiazi day, and midnight marks the Jiazi hour. Accumulating ten, a hundred, a thousand, and so forth, all is orderly and coherent, representing human effort. Humans are born into different qi, and their ailments are difficult to predict; I have yet to witness it as true. Alas! This is a biased viewpoint. One does not understand that the timing of heaven is not something an ordinary person can measure; the human body is endowed with tremendous transformation and life. </p>
<p>The Ming Tang poem states: &quot;Jia generates the gallbladder, Yi generates the liver, Bing generates the small intestine, Ding generates the heart, Wu generates the stomach, Ji generates the spleen, Geng belongs to the large intestine, Xin belongs to the lungs, Ren belongs to the bladder, and Gui belongs to the kidneys.&quot; The San Jiao also returns to the palace of Ren, and the channels converge in the area of Gui. [The poem indicates that humans embody the heavenly qi of Ren to give birth to the bladder at the gateway of life, embody the qi of Gui to produce the kidneys, embody the qi of Jia to produce the gallbladder, embody the qi of Yi to produce the liver, embody the qi of Bing to generate the small intestine, embody the qi of Ding to produce the heart, embody the qi of Wu to generate the stomach, embody the qi of Ji to produce the spleen, embody the qi of Geng to produce the large intestine, and embody the qi of Xin to produce the lungs. This applies to the heavenly stems as well as the earthly branches.] </p>
<p>Furthermore: &quot;Lungs correspond to Yin, Stomach to Chen, Spleen to Si, Heart to Wu, Small Intestine to Wei. Shen corresponds to the bladder, You to the kidneys, and Xun to the heart and channels of Xu, while Hai corresponds to the three Zi, Gallbladder to Chou, Liver to Tong.&quot; Observing these two poems, it becomes evident that the interaction among heaven, earth, and the human body is ceaseless.<a id="trans-572p" href="#orig-572p" class="marker">[572p]</a><br>The scripture states: &quot;Heavenly energy connects with the lungs, earthly energy connects with the throat, windy energy connects with the liver, thunderous energy connects with the heart, grain energy connects with the spleen, and rainy energy connects with the kidneys. The six channels form rivers, and the intestines and stomach form the sea; the nine orifices are water, infusing energy.&quot; Therefore, if even one energy is not in harmony, creation and transformation cannot occur. Heaven has six energies, and humans respond to them with three yin and three yang. </p>
<p>Speaking in terms of the six channels, there are three yin and three yang. When divided into twelve branches, there are six yin and six yang. Yin descends from above, is born in the afternoon, and reaches its peak at the midnight, termed as six yin. Yang arises from below, is born at the rat hour, and peaks at the snake hour, termed as six yang. </p>
<p>The earth has five elements, and humans respond to them with the five viscera and bowels. The viscera are yin, while their numbers are odd, corresponding to the five movements. The qualities of the five elements exist in the earth, while their energies move in the heavens.<a id="trans-573p" href="#orig-573p" class="marker">[573p]</a><br>The organs are yang, and their numbers are even, corresponding to the six energies. Though the six climatic pathogens descend from the heavens, they must inevitably fill the earth. Zi and Wu represent the center and uprightness of heaven and earth, with fire occupying its position. The Hand Shaoyin Heart resides at Wu, and the Foot Shaoyin Kidney is at Zi. Chen and Xu lead the seven governing powers, with cold water in their place. </p>
<p>【The cold water of Taiyang, having Zi&#39;s position at Chen and Xu, signifies that water lies hidden beneath the earth, thus Xu serves as the Six Wu heavenly gate, while Chen is the Six Ji earthly door.】 The Hand Taiyang Small Intestine is positioned at Xu, and the Foot Taiyang Bladder is at Chen. Hence, fire is transformed from water, and water follows the kidney; thus, Shaoyin occupies the organ position, integrating with Taiyang through the interaction of qi to form the fu (hollow organs).</p>
<p>Chou and Wei represent the prototype of storage, with damp earth in their place. The Foot Taiyin Spleen is at Wei, and the Hand Taiyin Lung is at Chou. Mao and You are the pathways of the sun and moon, with dry metal in their place. The Foot Yangming Stomach is at You, and the Hand Yangming Large Intestine is at Mao. Therefore, Zi follows its mother; with strong earth and flourishing metal, Taiyin occupies the organ position, integrating with Yangming through the interaction of qi to form the fu.<a id="trans-574p" href="#orig-574p" class="marker">[574p]</a><br>The Si-Wei (Snake-Pig) is the gateway of Heaven and Earth, where the Wood of the Wind is positioned. Although the Yin-Mao (Rabbit) is the proper division of Wood and is inhabited by the Yangming Dry Metal, Wood is generated in the Pig, hence it resides in the Pig and transforms in correspondence with the Si.</p>
<p>The Foot Jueyin (Liver) is located in the Pig, while the Hand Jueyin (Heart) resides in the Si. The Yin-Yang (Tiger-Monkey) holds the beginning and end of transformation, where the Fire of the Yin-Yang is situated. Although there is a position in the Wu (Horse) for the Yang Fire, this Fire ultimately resides in the Yin, for Fire is generated in the Yin.</p>
<p>The Foot Shaoyang (Gallbladder) is located in the Yin, and the Hand Shaoyang (San Jiao) resides in the Monkey. However, the Fire of transformation is hosted in the Liver and Kidney. The Gallbladder is the organ of the Liver, while the Heart&#39;s network corresponds with the Kidney, thus the Jueyin denotes the position of the organs, and the Shaoyang is separate but harmonizes with the Qi to form the bodily cavities.</p>
<p>The three Yin and three Yang, while named differently, are fundamentally one in essence.<a id="trans-575p" href="#orig-575p" class="marker">[575p]</a><br>When the yin and yang energies are weak, it is called &quot;less&quot;; when they are strong, it is called &quot;greater.&quot; Yin represents less yang, while the different phases are: Yin (寅) for less yang, Mao (卯) for pure yang, Chen (辰) for great yang, Wu (午) for less yin, Wei (未) for great yin, and Hai (亥) for extreme yin. </p>
<p>In the Southern governance, when the three yin dominate the sky, nothing responds at the inch level; when the three yin are in the spring, nothing responds at the foot level. In the Northern governance, when the three yin dominate the sky, nothing responds at the foot level; when the three yin are in the spring, nothing responds at the inch level. The lack of response is identified as a sinking pulse.</p>
<p>This indicates that among the six energies, the ruler is represented by fire, and among the five movements, damp earth is considered significant. Thus, the Earth movement of Jia and Ji is associated with the Southern governance, as earth constitutes the foundation, integrating the movements of metal, wood, water, and fire. Earth occupies the center, ruling from the south and issuing commands, while the other four movements serve as ministers from the north in a manner that delineates their difference. However, this pertains to the regular case. If there are seasonal illnesses from celestial movements, then not everything must strictly conform.<a id="trans-576p" href="#orig-576p" class="marker">[576p]</a><br>The classics say: &quot;The vital energy of heaven and earth is the source of all transformations, but it does not manifest in diagnosis. Heaven and earth operate through energy, not through positions; thus, one should not diagnose according to meridians, but rather observe through physical symptoms.&quot; From this perspective, the channels and organs, pulse diseases, and medicinal treatments all stem from the movement of vital energy. It is not confined to just one year; even in a fleeting moment, the energies of the Five Elements are ever-present. It is not limited to a single object; even in the tiniest detail, the transformations of the Five Elements are contained. When observed in the heavens, there are responses corresponding to the five stars’ patterns; when observed on the earth, there are evidences in the growth of plants and insects. How unfortunate it is that common physicians, unaware of the source of medicine, do not recognize what vital energy truly is; they lack understanding of the changes in medicine and cling to rigid prescriptions that harm people. In summary: There is the celestial vital energy, and there is the vital energy within humanity.<a id="trans-577p" href="#orig-577p" class="marker">[577p]</a><br>When the heavenly timing prevails, one abandons the afflictions of humanity and follows the way of heaven; when human ailments dominate, one relinquishes the heavenly timing to attend to human sickness. Zhang Zi said: If an illness does not align with the seasonal influences of that year, why consider it in relation to any other year&#39;s influences? Only by seeking the method of survival in a certain year can one truly understand the essence of truth. Bian Que said: Cold ailments arise from the excess of yin energies; warm ailments result from the excess of yang fire; ailments from wind are due to excess of wood influences; damp ailments stem from excess moisture; ailments from obscurity and confusion arise from excess dryness; prolonged clear weather without rain may lead to epidemics; heart ailments are caused by an excessive initial activation of the ruling fire. The classics state: One must first consider the yearly influences; do not disturb the harmony of heaven. It also says: Not understanding the impact of the year and the fluctuations of seasonal energies, one cannot pursue mastery. Scholars should combine their observations, refine their understanding of pulse diagnoses, and thus attain their own insights. Ah! The path of Confucianism is broad and succinct, while the path of medicine is rooted in the dynamics of energy. Can scholars not enter through this door and seek its profound essence?<a id="trans-578p" href="#orig-578p" class="marker">[578p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Collection of Books from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 120: On the Mechanisms of Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Mechanisms of Qi for Easy Reference</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Ji]</p>
<p><strong>The Outline of the Five Movements and Six Qis</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: The Five Movements and Six Qis are discussed in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; but various schools gloss over them. The principles are profound and not easily comprehensible; I wish for them to be elucidated. Danxi said: When beginning to study medicine, one must first understand the variations in disease mechanisms, discuss the human body, and assess treatments. If one hastily focuses on Qi movements, they might end up like the followers of Ma Zongsu, speaking of people born in certain years, becoming ill on certain days, and treating them with specific medicines. Someone further inquired: The five organs and six viscera in humans correspond to the heavens and the earth, governing Qi and movements, reacting to the changes of the eight winds. Isn&#39;t this quite relevant? If one does not understand this, how can they practice medicine without grasping the principles of regulation? The answer is that Yang Taishou also mentioned this.<a id="trans-579p" href="#orig-579p" class="marker">[579p]</a><br>The five movements and six energies must be observed daily, noting their wind, rain, clarity, and obscurity. Some may fall ill due to seasonal afflictions, others may fall sick due to latent energy after time has passed, and some may be affected by chronic conditions activated by external forces. With prolonged understanding, one will naturally reach the utmost skill.</p>
<p>【Written by Ding Yuanji, &quot;Outline of Movements and Energies&quot;: The purpose of this outline is based on the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and Liu Wenshu’s discussions of profound theories and significant concepts, complemented by annotations below. If the main annotations are insufficient, easily noticeable side annotations shall be provided. However, deep side annotations should be listed as figures for reference, blotted with ink.】</p>
<p>The classics state that where Yin is located, the pulse does not respond, and when discussing the three Yins, it does not refer solely to the Shao Yin. Wang Taifu notes that under the Tai Yin and Jue Yin, the Shao Yin is close in position, yet it neglects the fundamental Qi on either side. It does not take position into account based on personal inclinations, thus aligning with the essence. Therefore, all writings of Ma Zongsu reference this according to the position of the governing fire. This is what Danxi refers to as losing the fundamental principles. It is not followed today.</p>

<p>The discussion of the five movements and six atmospheres is not found in the classics of Confucian scholars, but is present in the medical text &quot;Suwen.&quot; &quot;Suwen&quot; is an ancient text predating the Qin dynasty; although not all its content may originate from the words of the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, during the time before the Qin, particularly in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, those such as the He and Yue people were indeed very proficient in medicine, yet their understanding of the applications of the five elements of heaven and earth was not as precise. Therefore, although these words may not fully belong to the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, their essence must have come from some teachings. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the cold, heat, damp, dryness, wind, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven, with the three yins and three yangs upheld above; while the wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of the earth, with growth and transformation responding below. The five movements occur within these, representing the transformative qi of the five elements. The heavenly sequence ends with five, while the earthly ends with six, leading to seven. The earth of Wu and Ji must channel qi through the five, hence Jia and Ji transform into earth and take precedence; earth generates metal, thus Yi and Geng follow; metal generates water, hence Bing and Xin succeed; water generates wood, thus Ding and Ren follow; wood generates fire, hence Wu and Gui follow. This is the order of transformative qi. The three yins and three yangs of the earth are indeed the five elements, yet fire uniquely has two, showcasing the profound principles of the five elements. It is said that wood flourishes in the east, fire in the south, metal in the west, water in the north, and earth is prosperous in all directions.<a id="trans-581p" href="#orig-581p" class="marker">[581p]</a><br>The fifth branch is attached to the tenth and is in the dry element; the sixth branch is attached to the fifth and is in the southeast; the position of the sixth is opposed in the second, hence the fifth and tenth branches with the second and fourth branches are in auspicious positions. The fifth branch is in the southwest, its hexagram is Kun, and its season is late summer. Because it is located in the middle of the four seasons, &quot;The Monthly Regulations of Lü&quot; refers to it as the center. If the transformation of the great horn of Ren wood is to open and separate, and it changes to collapse and pull, the great sign of Wu fire transforms to warmth, and changes to be fiery and intense; this is how transformation becomes change. The lesser horn of Ding wood, with insufficient wood energy, leads to clarity overcoming warmth, and warmth returning; the lesser sign of Gui fire, with insufficient fire energy, leads to cold overcoming and rain returning; thus, the transformation into return occurs. When cold is severe, it becomes the flame of yang, which represents fire; when mugginess and heat are severe, it becomes starkly clear, representing metal; this is how congestion becomes stifled and unextending. When water is congested and emerges, it becomes hail; when earth is congested and emerges, it becomes a sudden shower; this is how congestion arises in fury. When the wind overcomes, it defeats the great yin; when heat overcomes, it defeats the yangming; this is how it overwhelms what it defeats. Under the influence of fire, water energy is borne; under the pressure of damp earth, wind energy carries; thus extremes give rise to reversals. If the transformation into collapse and pull does not respond, then great winds will sweep across the sky; if the transformation into fiery intensity does not respond, the thin sea will be entirely scorched; if clarity overcomes does not respond, then the universe will be unmistakably bright and clear; if rain energy returning does not respond, then all mountains and marshes will be in steam and humidity.<a id="trans-582p" href="#orig-582p" class="marker">[582p]</a><br>The principles are rooted in prosperity, development, indulgence, and acceptance. All of these reflect a truth. When responding, there may not necessarily be a moment for it, leading to responses that occur unexpectedly. When the time has truly come, there can be sudden occurrences. Therefore, even at a distance of a thousand miles, there may be similar transformations; at a close distance of a hundred miles, the transformations may also differ. If one reads the signs in accordance with the time and place, it becomes possible to predict fortune and misfortune. Moreover, the &quot;Suwen,&quot; which discusses the transformation of the energies of heaven and earth, aims to observe these changes to alleviate the suffering of the people. The vastness of heaven and earth parallels the smallness of the human body, where the energies of the five elements reside. When the energies of heaven and earth remain constant, people will be at peace and free from disasters. However, when the energies of heaven and earth change and lose their constancy, ailments will arise. Therefore, when wood energy prevails, the liver experiences real illness, and the spleen suffers from deficiency. When fire energy prevails, the heart faces real illness, while the lungs deal with deficiency. This is something that doctors can discern, while scholars may not grasp the details. Furthermore, governing the heavens and earth, managing yin and yang, and aligning with the five elements ensures that winter does not bring unseasonable warmth, summer does not have lurking cold, autumn is free from bitter rain, and spring is devoid of sorrowful winds. When the harmonious energy flows between these seasons, the nation will not suffer from floods or droughts, and the people will be free from malevolent diseases; this is what scholars should observe, something doctors may not necessarily know. The &quot;Suwen&quot; also briefly touches upon this.<a id="trans-583p" href="#orig-583p" class="marker">[583p]</a><br>The essence of the Five Elements constitutes the Five Coordinates, corresponding with the cycle of fortune. There are the Year Star and the Morning Star; through these, one observes the reversals and smoothness of their paths, and divines fortune and misfortune. Yet it must be said, those with virtue will gain blessings, while those who err will incur punishment. This reflects the harmony of fortune and destiny leading to auspiciousness, summoned by the virtuous. In contrast, discord in fortune leads to afflictions, brought upon by the errant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this explanation is brief and lacks detail; the texts of our scholars provide thorough elaboration. The &quot;Hong Fan&quot; begins with the Five Elements, centers on the Supreme Ultimate, and concludes with the Five Blessings and Six Extremes. The sage establishes the Ultimate above to align with the application of the Five Elements, such that the people of the world possess the Five Blessings and lack the Six Extremes. With the Five Blessings, they can attain peace and well-being; devoid of the Six Extremes, they can evade illnesses. This principle naturally aligns with forces beyond mere fortune, which is why during the reign of Great Shun, it was observed.</p>
<p>Through the poem of Geng, yin and yang followed their paths; through the poem of Huashu, the Four Seasons maintained their harmony; through the poem of Yi, all things found their appropriateness. This establishes the Supreme Ultimate, aligns with the Five Elements, and demonstrates to the people the presence of the Five Blessings while lacking the Six Extremes. Therefore, the &quot;Su Wen&quot; is a manual of methods, while the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; is the grand doctrine of the sages in governing the world. To know the &quot;Su Wen&quot; but not the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; is to belong to the realm of prescriptions; to know the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; but not the &quot;Su Wen&quot; is not to be considered a accomplished scholar.</p>
<p>The Chart of the Twenty-Four Seasonal Points.<a id="trans-584p" href="#orig-584p" class="marker">[584p]</a><br>See the diagram.</p>
<p><strong>On the Climate of the Four Seasons</strong></p>
<p>The six qi begin and end at different times, and the five movements exhibit variations in fullness and emptiness. By examining the fundamental principles and analyzing the numerical patterns, we find that there has been no discrepancy throughout the ages. The classics say: every five days corresponds to a候 (hou), which aligns with the five elements. Therefore, three candidates form one qi, which spans fifteen days. Three qi together create one节 (jie), referring to the significant points: the beginning of spring, the spring equinox, the beginning of summer, the summer solstice, the beginning of autumn, the autumn equinox, the beginning of winter, and the winter solstice; these are the eight节. The four directions account for the twenty-four qi, governing the four seasons, thus completing the year. </p>
<p>In the discussions of spring and autumn, the term &quot;division&quot; refers to the monthly qi: by the end of the first half of the second month, one qi transitions to another, while by the end of the first half of the eighth month, the fourth qi concludes and transitions to the fifth. When discussing the qi of the four seasons, it is the yin-yang, cold-warm qi that can be categorized at this stage. Day and night are divided into fifty segments, which also represents a division of yin and yang. Therefore, the classics state: &quot;Division leads to differing qi.&quot;<a id="trans-585p" href="#orig-585p" class="marker">[585p]</a><br>In terms of the six atmospheric influences, when we speak of the arrival of winter and summer, the energy of May, under the control of Heaven, reaches its highest point; in November, the energy of the springs reaches its own place. When we reference the four seasons, the energies of yin and yang arrive at their extremes. At the summer solstice, the day does not exceed sixty double-hours, representing the peak of yang; at the winter solstice, the day does not fall below forty double-hours, representing the peak of yin, both of which indicate that the heavens have yet to change. Thus, it is said in classic texts: when the arrival occurs, the energies are the same. The heavens turn from west to east, with the sun, moon, and five planets following this celestial movement from east to west; therefore, it is stated in &quot;The White Tiger Compendium&quot;: the heavens turn left, while the sun, moon, and starry constellations move to the right. Furthermore, it is said: the sun represents yang, the moon represents yin, and their movements have divisions and principles. The sun travels one degree across the heavens, with each degree consisting of a hundred double-hours, totaling a day; the moon, however, traverses the heavens with thirteen degrees, where an odd number recurs—completing one degree while generating fractions, resulting in nineteen fractions yielding seven. [One degree consists of a hundred double-hours, yielding nineteen fractions equating to seven, with each fraction corresponding closely to five double-hours. Therefore, five times seven equals thirty-five double-hours, implying that the moon travels in the heavens thirteen degrees and an additional ten and a half double-hours].<a id="trans-586p" href="#orig-586p" class="marker">[586p]</a><br>The moon generally travels swiftly, completing its orbit in twenty-seven days. This corresponds to thirteen degrees and seven-sevenths of nineteen minutes. In total, it is twenty-nine days, measuring a movement of three hundred eighty-seven degrees and some extra. If we calculate the speed of the moon compared to the sun, in twenty-nine days, the sun travels twenty-nine degrees, while the moon has already completed a full orbit of three hundred sixty-five degrees, plus an additional twenty-two degrees, thus falling short by seven degrees compared to the sun. The followers of Yin and Yang say that the movements of the sun and moon are inconsistent, with the sun having variations in speed and timing, leading to differences in the sizes of the lunar months. The base of three hundred sixty-five days and a quarter corresponds to one full year, specifically twenty-five segments; thus, it may indeed be considered a year.<a id="trans-587p" href="#orig-587p" class="marker">[587p]</a><br>From the remainder outside the year, there are three hundred sixty days. Subtracting six days for the short months, we have three hundred fifty-four days making one year, which totals eleven days and twenty-five periods beyond, thus establishing the intercalary month system to create twelve months. This corresponds to the energy of the solstices, which reflects the arrival of the three seasons. The half-month signifies the orientation of the Big Dipper, which aligns with the twelve earthly branches. </p>
<p>In the records of the intercalary month, there are no established energies, and the orientations correspond to other energies, dependent on the calendar to reveal the eight seasonal festivals. The remainder after this determines the intercalary month, completing the celestial calculation. Thus, the texts state: “Establishing the beginning in the beginning, representing the middle accurately, and deriving the remainder at the end, completes the celestial calculations.” This refers to celestial observations that are so obscure that they lack a measure; rather, the movement of the sun and moon each day corresponds to the twenty-eight lunar lodges as evidence, hence noted as measure.</p>
<p>Therefore, it says in the texts: “The stars are the means for regulating the movements of the sun and moon.” To regulate means to have a system. The heavens themselves do not have signs; they manifest through wind, rain, frost, dew, and vegetation, which can be verified by seasonal occurrences, indicating a sign. Referring to a single sign corresponds to the five movements interacting harmoniously, spanning five days. </p>
<p>As in an endless cycle, it is continuous and returns. The texts state: “Expect three hundred sixty weeks plus six days, using the intercalary month to establish the four seasons and complete the year; this is its meaning.” The practitioners of medicine should certainly know this. It is stated: “Not knowing the increments of the year, the rise and fall of energies, or the origins of emptiness and fullness, cannot be considered skilled work.”<a id="trans-588p" href="#orig-588p" class="marker">[588p]</a><br><strong>Sixty Years of Qi Division</strong></p>
<p>The Qi begins in the year of the Jiazi at the moment of Yinjun, and according to this, Qi extends from Zi to Xu as the second Qi, from Hai to You as the third Qi, from You to Wei as the fourth Qi, from Shen to Wu as the fifth Qi, and from Wu to Chen as the sixth Qi. Starting from Si to Mao, the first Qi of the Yichou year commences. The subsequent years are calculated similarly, demonstrating that the Qi emerges at the same moment, and within three years it aligns harmoniously, the principle is evident. </p>
<p>However, there are a hundred marks of daytime and nighttime, which should be divided according to the twelve hours, with each hour encompassing eight marks and three minutes. </p>
<p>[Note: It is believed that each Qi governs sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks. For instance, in the year of Shenzi, the initial Qi begins on the day of Dahan at the beginning of Yinjun, extending to the spring equinox at the middle of Zi, thus the initial Qi just completes sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks. The second Qi starts on that day at the time of Zi, at eighty-seven marks and six minutes, extending until the minor full moon at the time of Xu, marking the second Qi which also completes sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks. Subsequent Qis follow this pattern based on visual representation. The mentioned eighty-seven and a half marks derive from the total of a hundred marks within the twelve hours. In the Jiazi year, the day of Dahan at the beginning of Yinjun brings forth the initial Qi, extending until the middle of the second month at the time of Zi, just filling sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks, precisely at the five marks of Zi. Remaining from the hundred marks after deducting eighty-seven and a half is twelve and a half marks, included in the second Qi, still amounting to seventy-five marks to total eighty-seven and a half marks.]<a id="trans-589p" href="#orig-589p" class="marker">[589p]</a><br>From the previous time period, at the sixth and a quarter, the energy of the second Qi began, extending to seventy-five quarters, reaching the fourth quarter of the dog hour. After subtracting seventy-five from a hundred quarters, there remained twenty-five quarters. This is included within the third Qi, which still requires an addition of sixty-two and a half quarters, totaling eighty-seven and a half quarters. From the previous dog hour and five quarters, the energy of the third Qi began, extending to sixty-two and a half quarters, thus reaching the fifth quarter of the rooster hour. After subtracting sixty-two and a half from a hundred quarters, there remained thirty-seven and a half quarters. This is included within the fourth Qi, which still requires an addition of fifty quarters, totaling eighty-seven and a half quarters. From the previous rooster hour and six quarters, the energy of the fourth Qi began, extending to fifty quarters, thus reaching the fourth quarter of the fifth day. After subtracting fifty from a hundred quarters, there remained fifty quarters. This is included within the fifth Qi, which still requires an addition of thirty-seven and a half quarters, totaling eighty-seven and a half quarters. From the previous fifth day and five quarters, the energy of the fifth Qi began, extending to thirty-seven and a half quarters, thus reaching the fifth quarter of the afternoon hour. After subtracting thirty-seven and a half from a hundred quarters, there remained sixty-two and a half quarters. This is included within the sixth Qi, which still requires an addition of twenty-five quarters, totaling eighty-seven and a half quarters. From the previous afternoon hour and six quarters, the energy of the sixth Qi began, extending to twenty-five quarters, thus reaching the fourth quarter of the dragon day. After subtracting twenty-five from a hundred quarters, there remained seventy-five quarters, included within the initial energy of the Year of the Wood Ox.<a id="trans-590p" href="#orig-590p" class="marker">[590p]</a><br><strong>Song: If you wish to know the intersection of qi at the early and late times, it drops a moment at the beginning of the first cycle. Finally, at eighty-seven and a half moments, two qi continue to rise from this. By seventy-five moments is complete; consider the half of six moments where three qi reside. At sixty-two moments and six parts, it begins, and fifty moments four qi reside. Five qi at thirty-seven and a half moments; six qi take away twenty-five moments. This continues to the start of wuchens, again dropping a moment like the beginning. The initial moments of shen, zi, and chen coincide, also the initial moments of si, you, and chou share the same time. The initial qi for yin, wu, and xu is not different; the initial moments of hai, mau, and wei ought to be stored together. Every four years is a small cycle tripled, six jia pass through without fail.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fifteen small cycles constitute one large cycle, which totals sixty years.</strong><a id="trans-591p" href="#orig-591p" class="marker">[591p]</a><br><strong>On the Sixty-Day Intervals of Solar Terms</strong></p>
<p>The day consists of one day and one night, divided into twelve equal parts; hence, a bronze vessel is set up to hold water, with a drip mechanism that allows it to flow and mark the divisions, creating a hundred increments for measure. Regardless of the clarity or obscurity of day and night, it cannot escape this measurement. Thus, within a single day, there are a hundred increments to observe. </p>
<p>The six energy cycles govern an entire year, therefore, one cycle corresponds to sixty days and eighty-seven and a half increments, from which we understand that the timing of these energy exchanges varies between early and late. Hence, this chart is established for clarity. The differences in daylight between winter and summer result in continual shifts between day and night, leading to different timings for sunrise and sunset; yet, they ultimately equal a hundred increments. However, the timings for the energy exchanges cannot be altered.</p>
<p>In a year of the Jiazi cycle, the first energy phase begins at the last minute of the water-dripping method in the early hour of Yin, and concludes at eighty-seven and a half increments in the middle of the hour of Zi. The second energy phase starts again at eighty-seven increments and six minutes, concluding at seventy-five increments in the hour of Xu, four increments into that hour.<a id="trans-592p" href="#orig-592p" class="marker">[592p]</a><br>The energy of the Three begins at the seventy-sixth moment and ends at the sixty-second and a half moment in the middle of the You hour. The energy of the Four begins at the sixty-second and six minutes and ends at the fifty moments before the fourth quarter of the hour. The energy of the Five begins at the fifty-first moment and ends at the thirty-seventh and a half moment in the middle of the Wu hour. The energy of the Six begins at the thirty-seventh and six minutes and ends at the twenty-fifth moment, which is four moments into the Chen hour. This is called the sensation and measurement of one complete celestial cycle, with the remaining moments entering the beginning energy of the Yi Chou year. In this way, by the time it reaches the Wu Chen year, the initial energy restarts one moment after the dripping water, thus constituting four years as one small cycle. Therefore, the convergence of the energies of Shen, Zi, and Chen happens here. The initial energies of Si, You, and Chou all arise at the twenty-sixth moment, with energies all starting from the fifty-first moment. The energies of Hai, Mao, and Wei also arise at the seventy-sixth moment, all starting from the same moment; thus, this is the meaning of being called the Three Convergences.<a id="trans-593p" href="#orig-593p" class="marker">[593p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Generating Numbers</strong></p>
<p>The sage establishes laws to advance cyclically, for one cannot escape their numbers. Observing the reasons for establishing these numbers, they all emerge from nature. The first is water, the second is fire, the third is wood, the fourth is metal, and the fifth is earth: Water is in the northern position of the Rat, which is the beginning of yang birth, therefore water is called one; Fire is in the southern position of the Horse, which is the beginning of yin birth, therefore fire is called two; Wood resides in the east, which is yang, thus three is an odd number and also yang, so wood is called three; Metal resides in the west, which is yin, so four is an even number and also yin, thus metal is called four; Earth corresponds to the southwest long summer. The fifth is an odd number and also yang, hence earth is called five. From this, it is argued that numbers are paired with yin and yang. Water generates at one, in the beginning when heaven and earth were not yet separated and all things were not yet formed, water is always the first seen; if we examine it now, the seeds of plants and the embryos of animals are all in water, is it not logical to regard water as one? When the water gathers and forms its qualities, the vital energies of yin and yang are present within, and then it becomes complete. Therefore, the small things that taste bitter signal the presence of fire.<a id="trans-594p" href="#orig-594p" class="marker">[594p]</a><br>When things are ripe, they are sweet; this is the flavor of the earth. When sweetness reaches its peak, it turns bland; blandness is the original flavor. However, people inherit the transformations of yin and yang from their parents, thus they have two kidneys: the left kidney belongs to water, and the right kidney belongs to fire. Fire is manifest only after water, hence fire is secondary. </p>
<p>Plants and trees, despite their varying sizes, all contain dualities within themselves, harmonizing in ways similar to the kidneys in humans, also bearing the signs of yin and yang. Therefore, if all things do not embody the union of yin and yang, they cannot undergo transformation and generation. </p>
<p>Once yin and yang are united, then spring gives rise to life and autumn brings completion. Thus, wood is ranked third and metal is ranked fourth. Water has its own domain, fire has its own reserves, wood has its own growth, and metal has its own distinctions; all these are ultimately realized through the earth. </p>
<p>Hence, the numerical generation of the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—must also include the number of the earth, which is five. Water is six, fire is seven, wood is eight, and metal is nine; the earth always maintains the generative number of five and cannot reach ten. The earth does not need to reach ten to fulfill its nature, for the numbers of generation are all based on combinations. Thus, how can all things escape their numerical destiny?</p>
<p>There are three yin and three yang; true transformations arise from the original generative numbers, while opposing transformations derive from the established numbers. </p>
<p>In the records of the five movements, those that exceed their numbers are completed, while those that fall short generate; each takes the extent of generative numbers to assess political decrees and the transformations of Qi. This clarifies the practical applications of these principles.<a id="trans-595p" href="#orig-595p" class="marker">[595p]</a><br>Here is the English translation of the Classical Chinese text:</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;See the illustration.</p>
<p>The song says: &#39;One and six represent water, two and seven represent fire; three and eight have always been aided by wood. Four and nine denote the countryside of metal, while five is the realm of the impoverished, as the infinite does not lead to completion, and ten is difficult to settle. The five movements cannot be used to predict life; if one encounters excessive conditions, this will inevitably follow. The six energies produce verification and transformation; when completed, mutual transformation is beyond doubt.&#39;</p>
<p>Discussion on the intersection of the six energies and the days.</p>
<p>The classic states: &#39;On the right side of the bright sun lies the position of the wood, the position of the fire. To the right of the fire lies the position of the earth; step back one space (which equals sixty days and eighty-seven and a half divisions); the fire of mutuality regulates it; stepping back again, the earth energy regulates it; stepping back again, the metal energy regulates it; stepping back again, the water energy regulates it; and once more, the wood energy regulates it. This is the main position of the six energies. Starting from the day of great cold in the twelfth month, we meet the initial energy of wood; then, arriving at the day of the spring equinox in the second month, we meet the second energy of fire; next, at the day of minor fullness in the fourth month, we encounter the third energy of mutual fire; following this, at the day of great heat in the sixth month, we meet the fourth energy of earth; next, at the day of autumn equinox in the eighth month, we encounter the fifth energy of metal; and next, at the day of minor snow in the tenth month, we meet the sixth energy of water. Each energy governs for sixty days, with each day having eighty-seven and a half divisions, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five divisions, completing the cycle of one year.&#39;<a id="trans-596p" href="#orig-596p" class="marker">[596p]</a><br>If we consider &quot;if&quot; as &quot;except,&quot; it seems to imply the following. The surplus of the year outside [the regular days]—the surplus being those days left after subtracting five days from the total of three hundred sixty-five—along with the days of the small months [which have six days each, also subtracted], does not suffice. After excluding the extra four to five days and the small month days, a total of eleven days is removed, leaving only three hundred fifty-four days, which falls short of the three hundred sixty-five. </p>
<p>However, when calculating the calendar days, according to the seasonal transitions and the changes in qi, there are usually the main vital energies of dryness, moisture, cold, heat, wind, and fire for each year, which correspond to the regular cycles of the six energies. This is referred to as the yin and yang of the earth that are stable and maintain their positions. </p>
<p>The varying responses to this include the celestial officials residing within the water springs surrounding the four directions who bring forth guest qi. These guest qi also manifest as cold, heat, dryness, moisture, wind, and fire, thus executing the heavenly mandate throughout the year, positioned above the main qi. The main qi should duly honor the mandate of the guest qi, which is always in motion. </p>
<p>In summary, the celestial officials preside over the first half of the year, while the water springs oversee the second half. When divided, each qi occupies its own peculiar six-day cycle, with each extraordinary period comprising eighty-seven and a half moments. </p>
<p>When the guest qi prevails over the main qi, it follows; when the main qi prevails over the guest qi, it resists. There is victory for one but not for both. Each year has the celestial official positioned in the third place as the water spring, and the fourth position as the initial qi. For instance, if Zi corresponds to the Lesser Yin of Fire as the celestial official, then the third place in front of Zi, which is Mao, represents the Yangming Qi of Dry Metal, while the fourth place in the water spring is Chen, representing the initial qi. Chen and Xu are opposites, both belonging to the solar cold waters, marking the period from Great Cold to the Spring Equinox, lasting a peculiar sixty days. Chen is situated to the left of Mao.<a id="trans-597p" href="#orig-597p" class="marker">[597p]</a><br>In the second position is the energy of the Earth, where the Si (巳) stands opposite to the Hai (亥), both belonging to the category of Jue Yin Wood. This governs from the Spring Equinox to the time of the Lesser Grain, spanning sixty days with some variation; Si is the right interval of Wu (午).</p>
<p>In the third position is the energy of the Fire, where the Wu stands opposite to the Zi (子), both belonging to the category of Shao Yin Fire. This governs from the Lesser Grain to the Greater Heat, also spanning sixty days with some variation; it is the custodian of the seasonal weather.</p>
<p>In the fourth position is the energy of the Earth again, where the Wei (未) stands opposite to the Chou (丑), both belonging to the category of Tai Yin Earth. This governs from the Greater Heat to the Autumn Equinox, again spanning sixty days with some variation; Wei is the left interval of Wu.</p>
<p>In the fifth position is the energy of Fire, where the Shen (申) stands opposite to the Yin (寅), both belonging to the category of Shao Yang Fire. This governs from the Autumn Equinox to the Lesser Snow, also spanning sixty days with some variation; Shen is the right interval of You (酉).</p>
<p>In the final position is the energy of Metal, where the You stands opposite to the Mao (卯), both belonging to the category of Yang Ming Dry Metal. This governs from the Lesser Snow to the Greater Cold, again spanning sixty days with some variation; it resides in the water spring energy.</p>
<p>Note that the six energies preside over the heavenly year and are positioned to the south, thus addressing left and right while facing north; the spring energy is located to the north, thus addressing left and right while facing south. For instance, in the year of Chou and Wei, Earth presides over the heavens, facing north. In this case, the left interval of Chou corresponds to the Shao Fire of Yin, while the right interval corresponds to the Jun Fire of Zi; in the year of Chen and Xu, Water is in the springs, facing south; thus the left interval of Chen corresponds to the Jue Yin Wood of Si, and the right interval corresponds to the Yang Ming Metal of Mao. Therefore, we conclude that left represents Jue Yin and right represents Yang Ming.<a id="trans-598p" href="#orig-598p" class="marker">[598p]</a><br>In this year, the guest qi is the initial qi of the Yin, represented by the Wood of the Hai (亥) sign; the second qi is the Shaoyin, which is represented by the Fire of the Zi (子) sign; the third qi is the Tearth of the Chou (丑) sign, controlled by the heavens; the fourth qi is the Shaoyang, represented by the Fire of the Yin (寅) sign; the fifth qi is the Yangming, represented by the Metal of the Mao (卯) sign; the final qi is in the Water of the Chen (辰) sign. This is how the heavenly control is positioned between the springs in four phases, with the guest qi adding to the host qi. The rest follows this model.</p>
<p>Wu Cheng of the thatched cottage states: The movement of Yin and Yang in Heaven and Earth circulates back and forth, continuing the cycle of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water, marking beginnings and ends, like a circular path, in order of the six qis generating each other. The annual qi begins and ends in the Zi; hence it is called the winter solstice. At the midpoint of Zi, the heart does not change; from Zi to Wu (午), the year begins with thirty days of dry Metal after the winter solstice, then it transitions into the cold Water until reaching the Fire of the Succeeding. There are five days of sixty each, and after the Minor Snow, its days return to thirty, ending once more with the dry Metal. For the years of Chou and Wei (未), it starts with thirty days of cold Water after the winter solstice, transitioning into Wood and Wind until reaching dry Metal, with five days of sixty each. Similarly, for days after the Minor Snow, its days return to thirty, once again ending with the cold Water. </p>
<p>This follows for Yin and Shen (申) and beyond. Thus, throughout sixty years to thousands of years, the order of qi generates without interruption. There are no teachings at the end of Minor Cold, nor acceptance at the beginning of Major Cold; if a qi is isolated, it does not continue intermixed. The cutoff from Major Cold marks the beginning of the next year’s initial qi. This is the marvel of creation, secretly recorded in the “Inner Canon,” yet not yet revealed— the original source is obscured in its discussion. In modern times, Yang Zijiang has explored and derived it, presenting interpretations that may not align perfectly with the texts but are deeply logical. I submit this here to enlighten scholars. </p>
<p>The Diagram of the Six Transformations.<a id="trans-599p" href="#orig-599p" class="marker">[599p]</a><br><strong>Seeing the Diagram</strong><br><strong>[The Song says: Water is cold, wood transforms into wind. They counter the heat of summer together, while damp earth shares the work with rain.]</strong><br><strong>On the Six Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The five elements take shape on earth—<strong>metal, wood, water, fire, and earth</strong>—and become the energies in the heavens, known as the six energies, which are the primordial energies of heaven, then three yin and three yang serve them. <strong>[Lesser yin governs fire, greater yin governs damp earth, jueyin governs wind and wood, lesser yang governs fire, greater yang governs cold water, and yangming governs dry metal.]</strong> These are called the six energies, each responsible for a transformation. The transformation of wood into wind governs spring. The transformation of lord fire into heat governs the end of spring and the beginning of summer, serving the warm and gentle mandate in accordance with the virtue of the lord. The transformation of fire into heat governs summer, where the heat prevails. The transformation of metal into clarity and dryness governs autumn, where coolness prevails. <strong>[The white dew represents clear energy. Metal represents the elements gēng and xīn; xīn is linked to fire, hence it is dry. After a long rain, when the western wind blows and becomes clear, it is a sign of dryness. When the western wind brings rain, dryness and dampness contend, yet it eventually clears.]</strong> The transformation of water into cold governs winter, where stern cold prevails. The transformation of earth into dampness and rain governs the long summer <strong>[June]</strong>, as earth is nourished by fire and grows during summer; once it has matured and rules, it moistens and transforms in the heat of the summer season.<a id="trans-600p" href="#orig-600p" class="marker">[600p]</a><br>The text states: &quot;The classics say: The earth&#39;s energy rises as clouds, while the sky&#39;s energy falls as rain. Rain emerges from the earth&#39;s energy, and clouds arise from the sky&#39;s energy, thus the transformation of earth and rain is revealed.&quot; </p>
<p>In spring, there is warmth; in summer, heat; in autumn, coolness; and in winter, coldness—all are the genuine energies of heaven and earth. The six energies govern transformations; when the guest follows the host&#39;s movement, there will inevitably be differences in reversal, harmony, triumph, and defeat, resulting in varied climates. How can one make definitive statements about them? </p>
<p>The interplay of yin and yang across the four seasons begins in the middle of each month and peaks in the final month, which is why the classics say: &quot;A difference of thirty degrees leads to the strange.&quot; It further discusses the influence of these energies during their rise and decline across the four dimensions, which are the four seasonal months: the second month for spring, the fifth month for summer, the eighth month for autumn, and the eleventh month for winter. Spring commences in the second month, peaks in warmth in the third; summer starts in the fifth, peaks in heat in the sixth; autumn begins in the eighth, peaks in coolness in the ninth; and winter starts in the eleventh, peaking in coldness in the twelfth, thus the differences in energy are evident.</p>
<p>However, in the month of the summer solstice in May, when the yin energy begins to rise, extreme heat occurs; in November, at the winter solstice, when the yang energy starts to emerge, extreme cold follows. This is due to the energy&#39;s origin from below, pushing upwards. Therefore, when yin arises, yang increases and it gets hotter; when yang arises, yin increases and it gets colder. The coolness of summer wells and the warmth of winter wells can serve as evidence of this.<a id="trans-601p" href="#orig-601p" class="marker">[601p]</a><br><strong>On the Principal Qi</strong></p>
<p>The qi of the earth is calm and maintains its position; thus, spring is warm, summer is hot, autumn is cool, and winter is cold, which are the regular orders of the years. The four seasons are born from the six qis. The wood of the Jueyin represents the initial qi, corresponding to the beginning of spring. Wood generates fire; therefore, the Shaoyin represents the lord fire, and the Shaoyang corresponds to the fire following it. Fire generates earth, thus the Taiyin represents the earth that follows; earth generates metal, making the Yangming correspond to the metal that follows; metal generates water, hence the Taiyang corresponds to the water that follows. All of these are mutually generated and spread their orders, each having its connections.</p>
<p>Wood, as the initial qi, governs the sixty days before the spring equinox, spanning from the start of the Doushu to the midpoint of the Yin zodiac, during which the wind qi begins to circulate. The lord fire represents the second qi, governing the sixty days after the spring equinox, from the start of Doushu to the midpoint of the Si zodiac, during which the warm and mild qi circulates. The xiang fire represents the third qi, governing thirty days before and after the summer solstice, from the start of Doushu to the midpoint of the Wei zodiac, during which the heat circulates.<a id="trans-602p" href="#orig-602p" class="marker">[602p]</a><br>The earth is associated with the Four Energies, governing the sixty days before the autumn equinox, where unusual phenomena occur. From the beginning of the Dipper, as it moves from Weizheng to the middle of You, when heaven reaches this point, clouds and rain will be present, and moist vapor will emerge. Metal corresponds to the Five Energies, governing the sixty days after the autumn equinox, where unusual phenomena also arise. From the beginning of the Dipper, as it moves from Youzheng to the middle of Hai, when heaven reaches this point, the clear energies will circulate, and all things will be dry. Water represents the Six Energies, governing the thirty days before and after the winter solstice, where unusual phenomena manifest. From the beginning of the Dipper, as it moves from Haizheng to the middle of Chou, when heaven reaches this point, the cold energy will circulate. The Six Energies rotate in a cycle to form the governing energy of the year. The six energies from heaven interact with this, transferring each year as they enact the celestial commands. Thus, acting at the right time leads to change that is constant; acting inappropriately brings disaster. For instance, if spring acts in the commands of summer, autumn, and winter, or winter acts in the commands of spring, summer, and autumn, this represents the distortion due to the interactions of the guest and the main energies. Therefore, there are regularities in effective governance and laws, as well as variations in violent winds, sudden rain, and lightning. In winter, there is heat like that of scorched stones, and in summer, a chilling wind. This is simply due to the energies of heaven and earth, thriving and flourishing together. This illustrates the five energies, reflecting the extremes of excess and deficiency.<a id="trans-603p" href="#orig-603p" class="marker">[603p]</a><br><strong>On Politeness</strong></p>
<p>The six energies divide into upper, lower, left, and right, overseeing the heavenly commands; the twelve branches divide into seasonal periods, governing the transformation of the earth&#39;s forces. The interactions between upper and lower phenomena, along with the changes of cold, heat, dryness, wind, and fire, differ from those of the four seasons due to their simultaneous presence and lack of unity. The six energies correspond with the twelve branches, finding their appropriate transformations. The Jue Yin corresponds to the Si and Hai branches, relating to Jue Yin wood, as wood originates in Hai, thereby its proper transformation occurs in Hai and corresponds to Si. Although Yin (Yin) represents the primary wood division, it also correlates with the Yang Ming metal transformation. The term &quot;sheng&quot; refers to drawing from and adhering to Si. The Shao Yin corresponds to Zi and Wu, where Shao Yin is considered the noble fire, aligning with the southern Li position, thus its proper transformation occurs in Wu, corresponding to Zi. The Tai Yin governs the Chou and Wei branches, with Tai Yin representing earth, associated with the center palace, residing in the Kun position to the southwest, thus its proper transformation occurs in Wei, corresponding to Chou. The Shao Yang is associated with the Yin and Shen branches, regarded as the lesser Yang fire, lower in rank than the noble fire; although it has the Wu position of noble fire, fire originates in Yin, hence its proper transformation occurs in Yin, corresponding to Shen. The Yang Ming corresponds with the Mao and You branches, where Yang Ming represents metal, and You refers to the West, thus its proper transformation occurs in You, corresponding to Mao. The Tai Yang corresponds with the Chen and Xu branches, with Tai Yang symbolizing water; despite its alignment with the Zi position as the noble fire&#39;s counterpart, it resides in the depths of the earth, specifically the six Wu at the heavenly gate Xu and the six Ji at the earthly door Chen.<a id="trans-604p" href="#orig-604p" class="marker">[604p]</a><br>Thus, although water is used for the earth, its true transformation occurs in the Dog (戌), and its counter-transformation in the Dragon (辰). This is the interaction of heaven&#39;s yin and yang with the twelve earthly branches, which move without ceasing. When the annual cycle begins, it is ordained by heaven; the corresponding qi is present in the springs, while the residual qi operates left and right. The qi succeeding the springs is the initial qi, governing the sixty days with anomalies, leading to the qi of the third for the heavenly overseer, which governs the first half of the year [starting after the winter solstice, extending to the first half of the year]. By the time it reaches the springs, it embodies the six qi, governing the second half of the year [starting after the summer solstice, extending to the second half of the year]. The classics state: Before mid-year, the heavenly qi governs; after mid-year, the earthly qi governs. The six qi of heaven are considered guest qi. When this guest qi is distributed over the six qi of the earth, there are distinctive transformations. The classics state: There are positions above and below, and rules left and right; the master of heaven is referred to as the upper position, facing north when standing in the south, with left being west and right being east. The springs are designated as the lower position, facing south when standing in the north, with left being east and right being west. Thus, above and below differ, as do left and right. The classics state: To the right of Shaoyang, Yangming governs, thus standing facing south to observe. This does not merely pertain to the positions above, below, left, and right; it aligns with the clear right, indicating the position governed by fire when facing south. The six qi diagram marks the basis of this.<a id="trans-605p" href="#orig-605p" class="marker">[605p]</a><br>See the diagram.<br>[The roots of the six qi are: Shao Yin (午), Tai Yin (未), Shao Yang (寅), Yang Ming (酉), Tai Yang (戌), Jue Yin (亥).]<br>[The song says: Zi leads Chen, and Chou is the earth; Mao is the metal, and Chen is the water that harmonizes with Si&#39;s wood. Shen is also included in this count, and the rest align with the fundamental transformations.]<br>The essential diagram of the Five Movements and Six Qi.<a id="trans-606p" href="#orig-606p" class="marker">[606p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Standard and Origin</strong></p>
<p>Three Yin and Three Yang represent the Six Qi of Heaven, which serves as the standard. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are the Five Elements of Earth, which represent the origin. The Greater Yin’s damp Earth and the Lesser Yang’s fire are the same in standard and origin. However, the Lesser Yin’s True Fire and the Greater Yang’s Cold Water are mutually distinct in Yin and Yang, cold and hot. Why is this? It is because True Fire governs the hours of the Rat and Horse; the Horse is the position where the first Yin begins to emerge. Fire is originally hot, but its energy coincides with the beginning of Yin&#39;s birth, thus True Fire belongs to Lesser Yin. Water resides in the North, the position of the Rat; the Rat is where the first Yang begins to emerge. Water is inherently cold, and its energy aligns with the beginning of Yang&#39;s birth, therefore Cold Water belongs to Greater Yang. This distinction between the standard and origin of Water and Fire is as such. Earth occupies the position of the Southwestern Wei, corresponding to the month of Long Summer. Wei follows the Horse, making it Yin; hence Earth is called Greater Yin. The Fire of Harmony governs the Tiger, which follows the Ox, making it Yang, hence Harmony Fire is called Lesser Yang. Wood is positioned in the Eastern Zhen, associated with the Liver in humans. Although Yang is situated below the diaphragm, it occupies a Yin position, thus it belongs to Jue Yin. Metal, located in the Western Dui, is associated with the Lungs in humans. Even though the Yin organ resides above the diaphragm, it occupies a Yang position, thus it belongs to Yang Ming. The classic states: Lesser Yang and Greater Yin are treated according to origin, while Lesser Yin and Greater Yang are treated according to standard. Yang Ming and Jue Yin do not derive from standard and origin, but are governed from the center. In the center of Yang Ming, there is Greater Yin [Greater Yin and Yang Ming are complementary and unite]. In the center of Jue Yin, there is Lesser Yang [Jue Yin and Lesser Yang are complementary and unite].<a id="trans-607p" href="#orig-607p" class="marker">[607p]</a><br><strong>Qi&#39;s Heavenly Control and Hospitality</strong></p>
<p>In the positions of the solar terms, the lesser yin corresponds to the noon and midnight, while the taiyin is associated with the vale of the ox and the sheep. The lesser yang belongs to the tiger and monkey. The yangming is linked to the hare and the rooster. The dragon and dog are paired with the greater yang, while the jueyin resides with the snake and boar. The center governs the heavenly positions, counted in this orderly fashion.</p>
<p>When encountering the year of the rat or horse, the lesser yin governs the heavenly control. Excluding the original positions, the third yangming indicates the spring at the source, while the fourth greater yang signifies the initiation of hospitality. Next comes the jueyin, then once again the lesser yin. From the winter solstice onward, the superior six months are under the greater yin, followed by the lesser yang, culminating in yangming. From the summer solstice onward, the inferior six months are governed. Each atmospheric phase lasts sixty days and eighty-seven and a half moments, distributed upon the dynamic vitality. The rest corresponds to the mapping of host and guest.<a id="trans-608p" href="#orig-608p" class="marker">[608p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Heavenly Energies and the Five Movements</strong></p>
<p>The heavens are divided into five energies, and the earth is categorized into five elements. The five energies flow and disperse above. They align with the constellations and correspond to the cardinal directions, thus being named the five movements. </p>
<p>The red heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Ox, Girl, and the Four Walls, descending to the positions of Wu and Gui, establishing the fire movement. </p>
<p>The black heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Heart, Tail, Corner, and Chariot, descending to the positions of Jia and Ji, establishing the earth movement. </p>
<p>The white heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Kang, Di, and the Four Stars, descending to the positions of Yi and Geng, establishing the metal movement. </p>
<p>The original heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Zhang, Wing, Lou, and Stomach, descending to the positions of Bing and Xin, establishing the water movement. </p>
<p>The green heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Danger, Chamber, Willow, and Ghost, descending to the positions of Ding and Ren, establishing the wood movement. </p>
<p>The five energies traverse the twenty-eight constellations, which correspond with the twelve divisions of the fields, clearly observable. Xu corresponds to the heavenly gate and is aligned with the position of Gan; Si corresponds to the earthly door and is aligned with the position of Xun. </p>
<p>From the Room to the Four Stars encompasses fourteen constellations of the Yang, representing the day; from the Four Stars to the Heart encompasses fourteen constellations of the Yin, representing the night, completing one day. </p>
<p>If one were to analyze this based on the lunar calendar, the reasons for establishing the movements become apparent. The character Bing represents the Yang of fire and is established at the beginning of the Jia and Ji year, with the first month marking Bing Yin. Bing fire generates earth, hence Jia and Ji represent the earth movement. The character Wu represents the Yang of earth and is established at the beginning of the Yi and Geng year, with the first month marking Wu Yin. Wu earth generates metal, hence Yi and Geng represent the metal movement.<a id="trans-609p" href="#orig-609p" class="marker">[609p]</a><br>The Geng element is the yang of metal, established at the beginning of the Bingshen year, with Geng Yin formed in the first month. Geng metal generates water; hence Bingshen corresponds to the water cycle. The Jia element is the yang of wood, established at the beginning of the Wugui year, with Jia Yin formed in the first month. Jia wood generates fire; therefore Wugui corresponds to the fire cycle. The Ren element is the yang of water, established at the beginning of the Dingren year, with Ren Yin formed in the first month. Ren water generates wood; thus Dingren corresponds to the wood cycle. All five cycles originate from the establishment of the celestial stems in the first month. Is it not true that the sun, moon, and seasonal times influence and determine their uses? Since the beginning of creation, the five energies have been transmitted and received, and the original cycles have operated in the world with their own ordained nature, which neither heaven nor earth can escape. In recent times, it should be the earth cycle, hence people are not ill but rather damp, in contrast to the era of heat during the fire cycle.<a id="trans-610p" href="#orig-610p" class="marker">[610p]</a><br>The text refers to a phenomenon commonly known as &quot;Yang Mei Chuang,&quot; which travels from the south to the north, where people and the earth are alike, and moisture creates mold, hence it is called mold sores. The cycles of the five elements and the six energies, as well as the governance of the north and south, are not limited to just one year or one season, are they? </p>
<p>The transformations of the ten stems and the five elements occur as each of the five energies takes its respective position and generates transformation. Some say that among the twelve zodiac animals, the dragon, which corresponds to Chen, is the most changeable, and each position establishes its own Yin-Yang combinations, leading to different transformations with the occurrence of Chen.</p>
<p>For example, when Jia Yin transforms into Bing Chen, it becomes fire; when Bing Yin transforms into Wu Chen, it becomes earth. </p>
<p>Moreover, some say that Jia, representing rigid wood, overcomes soft earth to create a couple, resulting in earth; while Yi, representing soft wood, marries Geng, which embodies rigid metal, resulting in metal. Ding, representing yin fire, pairs with Ren, representing yang water, leading to wood; and Bing, representing yang fire, marries Xin, representing soft metal, resulting in water. Wu, representing yang earth, marries Gui, representing yin water, generating fire. While these interpretations are similar in intent, the reasoning is not entirely natural. </p>
<p>This refers to a diagram illustrating the emergence of the five energies and five cycles.<a id="trans-611p" href="#orig-611p" class="marker">[611p]</a><br>The image shows a chart of the Five Energies establishing their influence.</p>
<p>The Five Elements&#39; energies spread across the five directions of heaven, categorized into the Five Heavens, hence they are named as such. </p>
<p>A verse says: &quot;Metal [Jin] is associated with Xu [the constellation], and the [star] Wei [the tail star] is at the forefront; Water [Shui] corresponds to Zhang [the wings] and the extravagance of the constellation; Wood [Mu] is linked to Cang [the azure dragon] and the ghost of Liuli; Fire [Huo] aligns with Dan [the cowherd] and the [constellation] Que by the wall; Earth [Tu] is connected to Du [the tail] and the angle position, descending to the operational positions in the heavens.&quot;</p>
<p>The monthly chart is depicted.</p>
<p>A verse says: &quot;Jia and Ji correspond to Yin; the remaining years are to be measured. Yi and Geng are to rise with Wu; Bing and Xin are to seek Geng. Wu and Gui are straightforward toward Jia, Ding and Ren again establish Ren.&quot;</p>
<p>In Jia and Ji years, the first month establishes Bing, with Bing fire giving rise to Jia and Ji soil. By extending this concept, the principle of establishing influence is all correlated, and each year&#39;s monthly celestial virtues can be derived according to this example.<a id="trans-612p" href="#orig-612p" class="marker">[612p]</a><br><strong>On the Establishment of the Lunar Months</strong></p>
<p>The twelve branches correspond to the twelve months: thus, the first month is Yin and the second is Chen. In the years of Jia and Ji, the first month is established in Bing Yin; in the years of Yi and Geng, it is established in Wu Yin; in the years of Bing and Xin, it is established in Geng Yin; in the years of Ding and Ren, it is established in Ren Yin; and in the years of Wu and Gui, it is established in Jia Yin. The ten stems are thus established upon Yin. Observing this method, the year of Jia Zi becomes the first, as it is the first in the sixty Jia Zi cycle. Consequently, the initial establishment corresponds to Bing Yin, and the subsequent one corresponds to Wu Yin—this order reveals a clear sequence that can be followed in rotation. In the previous sixty Jia Zi classification of sounds, once the positioning is completed, it again rotates to finalize the record. This is evident. </p>
<p>When establishing the time, the same principle applies to the day stem. If the five periods of Yin years do not reach that year, when the Day of Major Cold intersects with the Initial Qi, the day and time stems that correspond with the year stem are called De Fu, which indicates the balance of Qi, neither excessive nor deficient. This is briefly presented to clarify its application. The diagram is provided later.</p>
<p><strong>Diagram of the Five Tones Establishing the Quantum of Energy</strong></p>
<p>[Illustration]</p>
<p><strong>Song of the Ten Stems and the Transformation of Energy: Jia and Ji are associated with the Earthly Energy of the Soil, Yi and Geng are the Golden Energies. In the years of Ding and Ren, Wood predominates, and in the years of Bing and Xin, Water is sustained. Wu and Gui must seek the Fire Energy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Song of the Five Tones Establishing the Quantum of Energy: The sound of feathered water reflects the sound of fire; the earth resonates with the horns of wood and the metal of merchants. The year stem defines the quantum of Yin and Yang; the abundant energy is Yang, whereas the lesser is Yin.</strong><a id="trans-613p" href="#orig-613p" class="marker">[613p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Tones and Their Operations</strong></p>
<p>The five tones are the sounds of the five elements. The Earth is called &quot;Gong,&quot; which corresponds to the years of Jia and Ji. &quot;Gong&quot; represents the Earth. The way of balance and harmony permeates all aspects and is collectively referred to as &quot;Gong,&quot; encompassing various formations. It is understood that the Earth connects with Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, governing the four seasons and nourishing the five organs, all embodying a unified concept. Thus, the five operations begin from the ten Heavenly Stems, with Jia representing the Earth. The Earth generates Metal, hence Yi follows; Metal generates Water, thus Bing follows. In this way, the five elements generate and transform each other, with Jia as Yang and Yi as Yin, alternating in sequence like an endless loop. In Yang years, it is called &quot;Tai,&quot; and in Yin years, it is called &quot;Shao.&quot; An excessive Yang year is restrained by the Celestial Authorities, while an insufficient Yin year is joined with the Year Branch, both being termed &quot;Ping Qi.&quot;</p>
<p>Metal is represented as &quot;Shang,&quot; corresponding to the years of Yi and Geng. &quot;Shang&quot; signifies strength, referring to the resilient nature of Metal.</p>
<p>Water is referred to as &quot;Yu,&quot; corresponding to the years of Bing and Xin. &quot;Yu&quot; signifies comfort; as Yang energy begins to recover, all things grow and flourish.</p>
<p>Wood is called &quot;Jiao,&quot; corresponding to the years of Ding and Ren. &quot;Jiao&quot; signifies contact, symbolizing the emergence of Yang energy in a vigorous manner.</p>
<p>Fire is referred to as &quot;Zheng,&quot; corresponding to the years of Wu and Gui. &quot;Zheng&quot; signifies cessation, indicating that when things are abundant, they come to a halt.<a id="trans-614p" href="#orig-614p" class="marker">[614p]</a><br>The image of excessive and insufficient balance in energy<br>See the chart<br>【Song says: The occurrence is harmoniously arranged. Bright light rises to bring peace and order. Abundance is nurtured to transform the palace. Flowing streams recede, tranquility follows. Firmness transforms through careful examination of commerce. Too much and too little balance the energy’s record.】  【Each line has three parts: first is excessive, next is insufficient, and the last is balanced energy.】<a id="trans-615p" href="#orig-615p" class="marker">[615p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Seasons and Cycles</strong></p>
<p>Among the ten heavenly stems, there are five yin and five yang. These establish the five movements, which can become excessive or deficient, and mutually interact. In years of deficiency, the overcoming force comes to conquer, due to the emptiness of the cycle. Accordingly, there are certain years that align, and also certain years that correspond in mutual energy, as well as combinations of years and specific days, whereby they merge with the heavenly stems, which can provide assistance and are referred to as harmonious energy, achieving equilibrium in seasonal energy.</p>
<p>The growth and response of all things must harmonize without precedence or delay, and sages have established names to commemorate this. For example, in the year of Xin-Hai, when the water movement is at play, why is it said to be harmonious energy? Because Xin represents the water movement, and in the yin year, Hai corresponds to the northern water, thus the water energy becomes harmonious.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the year of Gui-Si, when the fire movement is present, it is also referred to as harmonious energy. Why? Because Gui represents the fire movement in the yin, and the year Si corresponds to the southern fire, thus the fire energy aligns harmoniously.</p>
<p>Each year initiates with the onset at the major cold day prior to the year. For instance, in the year of Ding-Hai, when the season&#39;s transition occurs, if it coincides with the day of the new moon and resonates with Ren, it is called the Heavenly Virtue Sign; &#39;sign&#39; means unity, thus establishing harmonious energy. If during the transition the encounter with Ren also represents the Heavenly Virtue Sign, after this initial point of energy overlap, there are no other mutual assistances.</p>
<p>The same pattern applies to the combinations; the so-called unions include Jia and Ji, Yi and Geng, Bing and Xin, Ding and Ren, and Wu and Gui. Further, in an yin year, if the month stem aligns, they complement and assist each other.<a id="trans-616p" href="#orig-616p" class="marker">[616p]</a><br>If one encounters the favorable elements without an association with the heavenly stems, it is still a balanced year. If one succeeds the previous winner and again encounters a combination of the heavenly stems, one achieves the rightful position. Therefore, a year of balance cannot be predetermined. The ten heavenly stems are arranged with yin and yang years to facilitate understanding. The balance of the year must be calculated according to the specific day and time of that year. Hence, the year of the Great Horn is termed &quot;Emergence&quot; (Excess), the year of the Lesser Horn is termed &quot;Harmonization&quot; (Insufficient), and the year of the Right Horn is termed &quot;Abundant Harmony&quot; (Balanced). The Great Zheng year is called &quot;Brilliant Radiance&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Zheng year is &quot;Hiding Brightness&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Zheng year is &quot;Ascending Peace&quot; (Balanced). The Great Palace year is termed &quot;Rich and Abundant&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Palace year is &quot;Low Monitoring&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Palace year is &quot;Prepared Transformation&quot; (Balanced). The Great Merchants year is called &quot;Strong Completion&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Merchants year is &quot;Following Change&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Merchants year is &quot;Carefully Balanced&quot; (Balanced). The Great Feather year is termed &quot;Flowing and Spreading&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Feather year is &quot;Dried Flow&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Feather year is &quot;Calm and Orderly&quot; (Balanced). Each of these years reflects the balanced energy, correlating with the right transformations, without excess or insufficiency. Additionally, during the era of excess, if the energy is suppressed by celestial forces, it still counts as balanced; thus, the record of Radiance includes the years when the cold water governs the sky (Wu Chen, Wu Xu) and the years when the two fires govern the sky (Geng Zi, Geng Wu, Geng Yin, Geng Shen); all are years of balanced energy.<a id="trans-617p" href="#orig-617p" class="marker">[617p]</a><br><strong>On the Influence of Tai and Sha Qi</strong></p>
<p>The influence and energy, whether Tai (Great) or Sha (Lesser), are governed by the cycles of time and seasons, which wax and wane. When they reach the heavens, there is a corresponding effect of the five stars diminishing; when they descend to the earth, there is the evidence of the five pests consuming life. The transformations of the five grains, five fruits, five flavors, and five colors vary; is there not one year that lacks any of these? It is merely about the abundance of maturity and the richness or thinness of color and taste. The Five Elements—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—coexist, with their transformations experiencing different states of prosperity and decline. In a Yang year, the energy is strong and excessive; in a Yin year, the energy is weak and insufficient. In times of excess, one who is strong seeks to harmonize with what is stronger; in times of deficiency, one who is weak is overtaken by the stronger energy. </p>
<p>In years of excess, Wood (Ren) aligns with Metal transformation; Metal (Geng) aligns with Fire transformation; Fire (Wu) aligns with Water transformation; Water (Bing) aligns with Earth transformation; and Earth (Jia) aligns with Wood transformation. In years of deficiency, Wood (Ding) harmonizes with Metal; Metal (Yi) harmonizes with Fire; Fire (Gui) harmonizes with Water; Water (Xin) harmonizes with Earth; and Earth (Ji) harmonizes with Wood.<a id="trans-618p" href="#orig-618p" class="marker">[618p]</a><br>When the Director of Heaven meets with the Celestial Mechanics, there are circumstances of contradiction and harmony, mutual constraints and assistance. The Director of Heaven maintains its proper order, while the Celestial Mechanics suppresses its natural balance. Thus, when the five energies are balanced and correct, there is no mutual infringement among them. </p>
<p>In years of great excess, each of the five movements governs six years, leading to thirty Yang years comprised of five and six. The Great Horn refers to the year of the Six Ren, encountering the second fire at Zihou and Zishen; thus, the Wood movement is the reverse, with fire occupying the higher position (the child occupies the father&#39;s place), which constitutes a reversal. </p>
<p>The Great Zheng refers to the year of the Six Wu, occurring with Cold Water in control. Here, the fire is properly suppressed, making it a year of balanced energies, where the upper feather and proper Zheng are the same. (Wu Chen, Wu Xu represent proper Zheng, along with Wu Wu patterns).</p>
<p>The Great Palace refers to the year of the Six Jia, while the Great Commerce refers to the year of the Six Geng. Occurring with the second fire at Zihou and Zishen, this suppresses Metal, again resulting in a year of balanced energies, where the upper Zheng and proper Commerce match each other (Geng Zi, Geng Wu, Geng Yin, Geng Shen represent proper Commerce, just as Yi You does).</p>
<p>Encountering Water at Chen and Xu serves as a reverse (Geng Chen, Geng Xu), as Water is the offspring of Metal and holds the upper position, thus being reversed. The Great Feather refers to the year of the Six Bing and does not exceed the years where each of the five movements governs six years, resulting in thirty Yin years comprised of five and six. The Lesser Horn refers to the year of the Six Ding, encountering Wood at Si and Hai serves to assist the flow, thus the upper Horn matches the proper Horn (Ding Si, Ding Hai represent proper Horn, similar to Ding Mao).<a id="trans-619p" href="#orig-619p" class="marker">[619p]</a><br>In the year of the Ding-Mao and Ding-Yin, when the metal presides over heaven, it aligns with the movement and transforms; thus, the Shang is in accordance with the Zheng Shang.</p>
<p>In the year of the Ding-Chou and Ding-Wei, when the earth presides over heaven, as wood cannot surpass metal in transformation, the earth receives its governance. The upper palace aligns with the Zheng Palace.</p>
<p>In the year of the Jiu-Qi, when the internal enters the Mao and You, the metal presiding over heaven allows water not to prevail against fire in transformation; therefore, metal receives its governance. The upper Shang aligns with the Zheng Shang.</p>
<p>In the year of Ji-Chou and Ji-Wei, when the internal enters the Chou and Wei, the earth presiding over heaven supports the movement; thus, the upper palace aligns with the Zheng Palace.</p>
<p>In the year of Ji-Si and Ji-Hai, when the wood presides over heaven, it aligns with the movement and transforms; thus, the upper jiao aligns with the Zheng jiao.</p>
<p>In the year of Yi-Mao and Yi-You, when the internal enters the Mao and You, with metal presiding over heaven, it receives support in the movement; thus, the upper Shang aligns with the Zheng Shang.</p>
<p>In the year of Yi-Si and Yi-Hai, when the wood presides over heaven, and since metal does not surpass fire in transformation, wood receives its governance; thus, the upper jiao aligns with the Zheng jiao.</p>
<p>In the year of Xin-Chou and Xin-Wei, when the earth presides over heaven, it aligns with the movement and transforms; thus, the upper palace aligns with the Zheng Palace.</p>
<p>What is said about the upper refers to the command of heaven.<a id="trans-620p" href="#orig-620p" class="marker">[620p]</a><br>The five elements, with their respective heavenly stems and earthly branches, vary from year to year based on fortunate or unfortunate encounters. For instance, when fire encounters fire or cold water, it generally corresponds to a yang year governing the heavens, while moist earth and dry metal, along with windy wood, typically align with an yin year in celestial governance. </p>
<p>Within a cycle of sixty years, there are various upper and lower influences at play; sometimes the heavens prevail over fortune, other times fortune outweighs the heavens. Occasionally, fortune may exceed what is appropriate, leading to excessive indulgence in areas where one ought to exercise restraint, or the fortune may fall short, avoiding areas where one prevails, failing to integrate its transformation. </p>
<p>As for the celestial symbols of the Great Unity, the annual associations with the heavenly symbols and their respective meetings have been detailed in other texts, so I will refrain from elaborating further. </p>
<p>According to the classics: when energies are in harmony, they synchronize. This includes the combinations of wood and fire, metal and water, water and wood, fire and earth, and earth and metal, all of which promote the generation of lower energies from the upper ones, allowing the heavens to influence fortune. Therefore, they are compatible. When they are incompatible, illness occurs, as seen in combinations where wood and earth meet, earth and water meet, water and fire meet, and fire and metal meet; in these cases, the upper elements suppress the lower, leading to disharmony and illness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when earth encounters fire, fire encounters wood, wood encounters water, and metal encounters earth, this results in fortune nurturing the upper realm, with lower energies opposing the upper, hence causing minor ailments. Similarly, if wood occupies positions of metal and earth, and fire occupies positions of metal and water, with earth in the positions of water and wood, and metal in positions of fire and wood, it indicates that fortune represses the heavenly influences, or vice-versa; such situations lead to disharmony, consequently resulting in significant illness. </p>
<p>The diagram of the five energies and the great minimalities harmonizing together.<a id="trans-621p" href="#orig-621p" class="marker">[621p]</a><br><strong>Five Transformations and Harmonization Song</strong></p>
<p>When the five elements are excessive, it is called harmonization; it can be predicted in any Yang year. If I prevail, and it meets my peak, even if it overpowers me, I shall harmonize it.<br>【Harmonize refers to wood wanting to harmonize with metal.】</p>
<p><strong>Five Transformations and Compounding Song</strong></p>
<p>When the five elements are insufficient, it is called compounding; it occurs in any Yin year when divination is used. My energy has declined, and the order is right; among them, those that prevail must come to compound.<br>【Compounding means the strong assimilate the weak, as water assimilates fire.】<a id="trans-622p" href="#orig-622p" class="marker">[622p]</a><br><strong>Annual Balance Song</strong></p>
<p>Balance is carefully adjusted over the years, not merely lacking timeliness. In yang years, the heavens suppress movement, while in yin years, movements align with the year&#39;s branches. If in a yang year of Wu Chen fire is excessive, and water governs the heavens, suppression leads to balance. In a yin year of Gui Si, fire is insufficient, yet Si belongs to fire; with its assistance, balance is also achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive Five Movements Song</strong></p>
<p>The upper feather correctly corresponds, as Wu fire encounters water energy. The upper Zheng corresponds correctly, as Geng metal&#39;s fire movement is. The designation of upper Zheng refers to the years encountering excess or insufficiency, based on the original movement being less; the Heavenly governance energy is above, which might surpass its proper form, thus transforming and aligning perfectly, not merely superior. Therefore, when the self is excessive, the upper part suppresses for balance, hence the upper energy resonates in harmony with the proper energy.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Five Movements Combined with Heavenly Support Song</strong></p>
<p>The upper Jiao coincides with the proper Jiao, as Ding movement wood governs the heavens. The upper Gong coincides with the proper Gong, as Ji movement earth energy is suspended. The upper Shang coincides with the proper Shang, as Yi movement metal energy flows.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Sound Movement Overpowers with Heavenly Support and Transformation Song</strong></p>
<p>Wood energy movement encounters self, the upper Jiao appropriately aligned. Earth energy movement encounters Xin, the upper Gong appropriately overlaps. Metal energy movement encounters Ding, the upper Shang properly corresponds. When the superior self is dominant, transforming aligns thus, hence the proper sound follows the heavenly governance.<a id="trans-623p" href="#orig-623p" class="marker">[623p]</a><br>The dynamics of sound do not surpass the governance of Heaven in securing the rhythm of song.</p>
<p>Why does the upper angle coincide with the correct angle? Fire, along with the transformation of wood, governs the season. The upper palace aligns with the correction of the center palace, where metal accompanied by the transformation of earth governs the energy. The upper commerce naturally aligns with the correct commerce, with water combined with the transformation of metal governing it. </p>
<p>[The self does not return to its origin, as it is dominated by what&#39;s superior. When it encounters something that can overpower it, it finds governance above, while itself is entirely weak, hence the center palace also aligns with the governance of Heaven.]</p>
<p>Discussion on the dominance and reversal of the Five Elements.</p>
<p>Someone has said: In the fourth year of Yuanfeng, during the year of Xin You, the Yang Ming governs the heavens for the upper commerce, while the Shao Yin resides in the spring for the lower military. The weather is dry and the energy of the earth is hot. The operation benefits from the lesser wings, but the water of the year does not reach its potential, which is called the record of drained streams, yet the river reverses and floods arise; what is the reason? It is said: The operation of the lesser angle is that the annual wood does not reach its potential, and the one that insults and rides upon it is metal. Metal does not pursue virtue, hence dryness overcomes wind. At that time, the white dew descends early, the energy is harvested early, its transformation leads to desolation, and its disaster causes sudden collapse, named the lesser angle, yet it truly aligns with the year of Tai Shang.</p>
<p>The operation of the lesser military is that the annual fire does not reach its potential, and the one that insults and rides upon it is water. Water does not pursue virtue, hence cold overcomes heat. At that time, cold tears fall, the earth accumulates hard ice, its transformation leads to chilling, and its disaster brings frost and hail, named the lesser military, yet it truly aligns with the year of Tai Yu.</p>
<p>The operation of the lesser palace is that the annual earth does not reach its potential, and the one that regrets and rides upon it is wood.<a id="trans-624p" href="#orig-624p" class="marker">[624p]</a><br>When wood does not cultivate virtue, it allows the wind to overpower the dampness. Thus, there are times when strong winds blow violently, causing grass to bend and sand to rise. This transformation leads to stirring upheaval, and the disaster results in scattering, known as the Lesser Palace, yet it is the same as the year of the Great Horn.</p>
<p>In the operation of Lesser Commerce, when the year of metal is insufficient, those who insult and dominate are the fires. When fire does not cultivate virtue, it allows heat to overpower dryness. Thus, flames scorch and char, heated and boiling, leading to melting and destruction, known as Lesser Commerce, yet it is the same as the year of the Great Conquest.</p>
<p>In the operation of Lesser Feather, when the year of water is insufficient, those who insult and dominate are the earth. When earth does not cultivate virtue, it allows dampness to overpower cold. Thus, springs surge and rivers overflow, drying lakes give birth to fish; this transformation leads to sudden deluges, and the disaster results in torrential rains, known as Lesser Feather, yet it is the same as the year of the Great Palace.</p>
<p>By understanding this, one can know when the year is marked by drought in the currents, and when the river breaks its banks, one can draw parallels. It is not just this alone.<a id="trans-625p" href="#orig-625p" class="marker">[625p]</a><br>Between heaven and earth, some are born from the cosmic force, while others perish due to discordant energies; none can escape the five elements. The so-called cosmic force merely does not conflict with itself. The so-called discordant energy, on the other hand, causes conflict and recurring strife. When the discord breeds contention, ferocity takes shape, and anger begins to sprout; to seek victory over the other while in this state is futile. Even with strong and valiant spirit, how can one always triumph? Therefore, those who have been defeated await their chance. Thus, when wood overcomes, metal counters to save the earth, and wood fails to thrive; when fire overcomes, water counters to save metal, and hail falls as a result; when earth overcomes, wood counters to save water, and pests do not reproduce; when metal overcomes, fire counters to save wood, and rivers do not freeze; when water overcomes, earth counters to save fire, and grain does not prosper. Those who are violent and lack virtue bring disaster upon themselves; those who insult and ride roughshod over others shall also face retribution. What comes from you returns to you; there has never been a victory devoid of consequence. The subtle victories beget subtle consequences.<a id="trans-626p" href="#orig-626p" class="marker">[626p]</a><br>Those who excel excessively will also face excessive challenges, akin to echoes in an empty valley. Therefore, it is said that the energies of the five phases are like scales. The high are suppressed, the low are raised, the transformative respond, the victorious revert, and the balance of energies reflects the mutual gains of the five phases. The victorious reverting signifies imbalance in energies and the mutual detriment among the five phases. When energies are balanced and mutually supportive, it reflects the constancy of the way; when they are unbalanced and mutually detrimental, it prompts observation of change. Those in ancient times who understood this well and adeptly nurtured life never failed to align with the fluctuating fullness and emptiness, managing the divine with the path! They did not lose celestial trust, nor act against suitable energies; they restrained excess without hoping for victory and helped the defeated without encouraging a return. Thus, emotions of joy, anger, sadness, worry, and fear have their boundaries and cannot be disturbed; the spirit, soul, and thoughts have their nourishment and cannot be harmed. Spring winds and autumn rains, winter coolness and summer heat, though the heavenly way often changes, such as during famine or pestilence, how could they result in suffering?<a id="trans-627p" href="#orig-627p" class="marker">[627p]</a><br><strong>Seeing the Diagram</strong></p>
<p><strong>Victory and Defeat Are the Same Song</strong></p>
<p>The victory and defeat do not match the years; when the fate declines, victory over oneself will surely add to the mistakes. The mother’s rivalry and the child’s prosperity must return; the child transforms with time and can again achieve victory. Just as in the case of the Ding year, wood does not surpass gold; when pure transformation arrives, fire becomes the return, reversing the heat to win over gold. I follow this pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Victory and Defeat</strong></p>
<p>Fate has its ups and downs, and energy has its fullness and emptiness, thus responding to each other according to the years. Therefore, the classics say: &quot;What is surplus should not go forth; what is insufficient thus follows after.&quot; Hence, the changes of too much and too little in the alternation of victory and defeat arise. When the excess is too great, the primordial celestial changes occur, with energy winning over reality, leading to the vanquished being afflicted. When the deficiency is too great, the post-celestial changes arise, and diminishing energy leads to those who win becoming conquerors. After being vanquished, one must wait for the right time to return. When returning to what has been conquered, one cannot advance, so one must wait until the right moment arrives for the child to flourish, then the child becomes the mother’s rival again. For instance, in a year of wood with few horns, when the pure metal transforms and wins, the child fire becomes the return; also, the return won is fire winning over gold, thus it is stated that victory and defeat are the same. Reversing heat wins over gold as well. When the fire is scarce in its transformation, and in a year where cold water wins due to the chill, the child earth becomes the return, reversing humidity to win over water. When the earth is scarce in its palace, and wood transforms with the wind winning in a year, the child metal becomes the return, reversing purity to win over wood. When metal is scarce in its commerce, in a year where hot fire wins due to heat, the child water becomes the return, reversing cold to win over fire. When water is scarce in its feathers, and in a year where damp earth wins due to humidity, the child wood becomes the return, reversing wind to win over earth.<a id="trans-628p" href="#orig-628p" class="marker">[628p]</a><br>Thus, the statement about victory and recurrence being the same refers to this. The &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; discusses the six energies, which have the authority of positive transformation and counter-transformation. If the authority of the positive transformation is substantial, victory occurs without recurrence; if the authority of the counter-transformation is insubstantial, victory may occur but recurs slightly. If victory is great, recurrence is also great; if victory is slight, recurrence is likewise slight, hence the saying about the transformation of evil energies.</p>
<p>It is said that the great energies have varying degrees of victory and recurrence. When these energies do not align, it leads to evil energies entering people and illness. However, the energies of heaven and earth also operate in victory and recurrence; thus, the classics state that the initial energy reaching the three energies is governed by heaven, representing the constant of victory. When the four energies conclude, it is governed by earth, representing the constant of recurrence. Indeed, victory arrives, then recurrence follows; if recurrence occurs, then victory arises, thus there is no permanence. When the energies cease to recurrently overpower, it signifies that the life force has been exhausted, hence the phrase about harming life. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if seasonal energies are excessive, those unable to achieve victory suffer from evil. Should they seize the essence and deceive those they cannot overcome, while the energies do not reach those they should overcome, they will be attacked by those unable to be defeated, leading ultimately to the reception of evil, thus misfortunes arise from not having energies superior to their own. Therefore, the classics say that what one humiliates will return as evil; this is what is meant. If this does not happen uniformly, it depends on the climate to differentiate.<a id="trans-629p" href="#orig-629p" class="marker">[629p]</a></p>
<h3>Song of the Transformation of Pre-Heaven and Post-Heaven</h3>
<p>When the Qi is excessive, the transformation of Pre-Heaven occurs. When the Qi is insufficient, the transformation of Post-Heaven takes place. The operations and transformations should be refined and distinctive, allowing the Qi to flow according to the appropriate order of before and after. Post-Heaven is influenced by what cannot be reached, while the excessive belongs primarily to Pre-Heaven.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Sixty-Year Guest Qi</h3>
<p>When the celestial bodies are in the Spring, the various seasonal Qi marks move in cycles, each governing sixty days and eighty-seven and a half units of time. The guest Qi follows the heavenly decree above the main Qi, hence there arise different transformations: warmth and coolness, cold and heat, twilight and bright days, wind, rain, frost, snow, lightning, hail, and thunder. The warmth of spring and the heat of summer, the coolness of autumn and the cold of winter—these seasonal commands cannot entirely be due to luck and Qi alone; therefore, there must be significant variations appropriate to the time. By laying out these sixty guest Qis beneath the main positions, one recognizes the great principles governing Qi’s location. The celestial symbols of the yearly cycle harmonize and balance the Qi’s branches and stems, where reverse and normal Qi spawn and overcome one another; guests can surpass the host, and calamities can vary in nature. Changes of fortune might either flourish or be stifled, and auspicious omens contrast with disasters, each differing uniquely. When Qi is at its peak, it may become excessive, leading to calamity. Thus, when Qi reaches its utmost, it reverses. This is why the inherited Qi resides below to ride upon it, as referenced in the teachings regarding the mutual fire beneath, where water Qi holds it up. There is also the Qi perceived from above, corresponding to the lesser Yang, where fire Qi governs it, as indicated by the lesser Yin. The principle is that when Yang is at its extreme, Yin emerges, and when Yin is at its extreme, Yang emerges; this is the marvel of mutual assistance. The Qi perceived in this way involves the transformations of the six organs of the body working together. Among Heaven and Earth, Qi accordingly responds.<a id="trans-630p" href="#orig-630p" class="marker">[630p]</a><br><strong>On the Six Energies of Heaven and Earth</strong></p>
<p>The energies of the Five Elements and Yin-Yang spread to the eight directions. Indeed, the energy of heaven descends while the energy of earth ascends. The energy of the earth is calm and constant, while the energy of the heavens is dynamic and ever-changing. The source of the six energies is the same, but their manifestations differ. Why is this? It is because the energies of heaven and earth begin with Shaoyin and end with Jueyin. The classic states that Shaoyin is the beginning, while Jueyin is the end. The energy of the earth starts with Jueyin Wood and concludes with Taiyang Water. The classic states, &quot;On the side of clarity, this is the position of the ruling Fire.&quot; Therefore, the six energies of heaven, along with the twelve earthly branches, correspond to the Five Elements and transform accordingly. Thus, Shaoyin governs the Zi and Wu hours, Taiyin governs the Chou and Wei hours, Shaoyang governs the Yin and Shen hours, and Yangming governs the Mao and You hours. And so it is.<a id="trans-631p" href="#orig-631p" class="marker">[631p]</a><br>The six energies of the Earth combined with the four seasons of Heaven are correlated to wind, heat, summer, moisture, dryness, and cold. The Jueyin (Liver) represents spring, the Shaoyin (Heart) signifies late spring and early summer, the Shaoyang (Triple Burner) governs summer, the Taiyin (Spleen) oversees late summer, the Yangming (Large Intestine) takes charge of autumn, and the Taiyang (Kidney) rules winter. The causes for the start and end of the Earth’s energies are thus. </p>
<p>The texts say: Heaven has Yin and Yang; the Earth also has Yin and Yang, from their mutual presence above and below. The energy of Heaven is dynamic and never still, thus it migrates every five years to the right; the energy of the Earth is calm and maintains its position. If the energy of Heaven does not increase the fire of the ruler, then every five years one energy remains, migrating above the fire of the ruler, because the fire of the ruler does not establish a year.</p>
<p>The cycles of the Earth are complete every five years, while the cycles of Heaven are fulfilled every six periods. When five years pass, the energies of the five elements are widespread; through the six periods, the positions of the six energies are complete, somewhat similar to the interactions of the heavenly stems and earthly branches. Yin and Yang intertwine. The mutual enhancement of above and below conveys the intent of fulfilling their cycles. With the combination of five and six, a cycle is completed every thirty years, leading to a total of sixty years. </p>
<p>This corresponds to the diagram of the interaction of the six energies over time.<a id="trans-632p" href="#orig-632p" class="marker">[632p]</a><br>The text describes a diagram related to the movement and changes of the six vital energies. The song mentions the following associations: </p>

<li>Wei (Earth resides) with Xu (Water hidden in the heavenly gate) and Hai (Wood generates) as the primary directions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It further states that the twelve Earthly Branches are divided in half, with the remaining ones seeking corresponding changes. </p>
<p>The transformations are outlined as follows:</p>

<li>Shaoyin directly transforms in Wu, corresponding to Zi;</li>
<li>Taiyin directly transforms in Wei, corresponding to Chou;</li>
<li>Shaoyang directly transforms in Yin, corresponding to Shen;</li>

<p>The one who governs the heavens is the one who directs, commanding the decrees of heaven from a high position; the cyclical years refer to the movement that governs the transformative energies of all beings between heaven and earth, positioned in the middle; while the one in the springs governs the transformations of the earth, positioned below. Within a year, these three energies—upper, middle, and lower—each enact their transformative decrees. When the energies resonate and converge, they align in their transformations. Even without any significant changes, there can be distinct variations in ailments, whether subtle or severe. This is known as the celestial sigil of the year: when the heavenly energy and the middle energy of the year are in harmony, it is called the Heavenly Sigil, symbolizing unity.</p>
<p>Within the twelve years, there are also those that coincide with the five elements of the twelve pitches of that year, indicated as the Great Yin Heavenly Sigil. The term &quot;Great Yin&quot; is a title of reverence. It refers to three connections: the heavenly connection, the yearly connection, and the cosmic connection. During the four years, regardless of whether they are yin or yang years, all are termed under the heavenly sigil as enforcement of law, with the yearly connection enacting the decrees, and the Great Yin Heavenly Sigil representing the noble ones. For those in between, the enforcers of the law may face rapid and severe ailments, while those following the decrees may experience gradual and enduring sickness. For the noble ones, their ailments may come abruptly and lead to death, for the energy decrees are profound among the intermediary ones.</p>
<p>When the yearly connection aligns with the pitches but not with heavenly decrees, it refers to the enforcement of decrees—representing one who does not possess the authority of law enforcement, thereby suffering no rapid danger from illness, but merely enduring it.<a id="trans-636p" href="#orig-636p" class="marker">[636p]</a><br><strong>The Diagram of the Yearly Meeting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Yearly Meeting</strong></p>
<p>In a given year, the interaction of the ten heavenly stems with the twelve earthly branches and the five elements is referred to as the Yearly Meeting, which signifies the balance of energies. Therefore, it does not distinguish between yin years and yang years but rather takes the middle of the four seasons—specifically, the first month of the year—as the foundation for the four clear months of the cycle. The positions of Zi (Rat), Wu (Horse), Chen (Dragon), and Xu (Dog) represent this. The earth has no fixed position; instead, it contributes to the flourishing of the four seasons towards the end of each. If there are significant occurrences every eighteen days, then it is said that the discussion of the cycle embraces the zodiac signs of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei.</p>
<p>Externally, there are four years: Ren Yin (Water and Wood) signifies yang years, while Geng Shen (Metal) also signifies yang years, making them two yang years. Gui Si (Water and Fire) and Xin Hai (Metal and Water) signify yin years, resulting in two yin years. Hence, the movement aligns with the yearly zodiac signs, which is not considered a Yearly Meeting because it does not conform to the principal decree of the four years.</p>
<p>Excluding the two yang years, the two yin years, Gui Si and Xin Hai, while not designated as Yearly Meetings, also align in their five elements and collectively represent a balanced energy year. The emergence of all things corresponds to a unified cycle; thus, there are no precedents or sequences in timing. Within the eight years of the Yearly Meeting, the four years that align with the deity of weather have already entered the great Taiyi celestial symbol.<a id="trans-637p" href="#orig-637p" class="marker">[637p]</a><br><strong>On the Same Heavenly Talismans and Same Year Assemblies</strong></p>
<p>The movements of fate align with the springs; this transformation in the Yang year is called the same heavenly talismans, while in the Yin year, it is called the same year assemblies. In sixty years, there are four years of the Great Yin Heavenly Talismans, twelve years of heavenly talismans, eight years of year assemblies, six years of the same heavenly talismans, and six years of the same year assemblies. If articulated separately, they total thirty-six years; if combined, there are only twenty-seven years. The classic mentions twenty-four years but does not refer to year assemblies. There are variations in actions, degrees of illness, and timings of life and death. By consulting the texts, one can discern these patterns. A &quot;talisman&quot; means a convergence. &quot;Great Yin&quot; is a term of reverence. Only the signs of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei preside over the true central positions of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, which govern year assemblies; the others do not represent the precise convergence. In adverse situations, the Great Yin can lead to sudden death, while the year assembly may result in gradual decline, and heavenly talismans can bring swift yet precarious situations. </p>

<p>&quot;Seeing the diagram, the Celestial Talisman of Taiyi and the Celestial Talisman Year: The meeting of the Celestial Talisman together with the year’s branches, the three positions mutually referring to the Taiyi Talisman. When the luck combines with the year branch, it is called the Year Meeting, and the four pillars of Earth must follow the same path. When in the spring coinciding with luck, the Yin is the same as the year, while the Yang corresponds to the Celestial Talisman calling out. Only regarding the Celestial Talisman, what does it signify? The management of Heaven in conjunction with luck is its distinction.</p>
<p>The Talisman of Dry Virtue: Regardless of whether there are diagrams, reading its song will make its meaning clear; thus, it is recorded here. </p>
<p>When neither the year nor the month matches with the Talisman of Dry Virtue, it won’t encounter the vigorous energy and will also be moderate. After surpassing the vigor, the original energy will then appropriately obtain the position of virtue. The year before, during the major cold at the beginning of energy transition, the day’s Talisman combines with the year’s Talisman position. During the transition of energy, if they combine, both will be peaceful energy. </p>
<p>[Note: For example, in the Year of Ding You, if the Wood energy does not prevail, the Metal energy is strong. In the first month, when Ren combines with Ding, this Wood encounters a dominance. In the Year of Ji Mao, if the Earth energy is weak, it falls under Wood dominance; with Metal returning, in the ninth month, when Jia combines with Ji, the Earth returns to its position. After surpassing the previous vigor, it also means finishing after surpassing the original energy. The year, day, and time exclude the beginning of energy transition; the rest may encounter but do not assist each other. Combining means when Jia and Ji join together is an example.]&quot;</p>
<p>---<a id="trans-639p" href="#orig-639p" class="marker">[639p]</a><br><strong>On the Channels of the Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>The classics state that the five organs and twelve meridians are all connected to the influences of the heavens. This discusses the three Yin and three Yang channels of the hands and feet. The twelve channels run externally along the body&#39;s form and internally connect to the organs, corresponding to the twelve months and thus the twelve sections. The five organs are Yin, and the six bowels are Yang. One Yin and one Yang together form a unity, thus the concept of the Six Harmonies.</p>
<p>The Lesser Yin channel, governing the heart and kidney organs, is associated with the heart&#39;s element of fire, while its pathway lies mainly in the kidney. Furthermore, the Heart fire presides at noon, and its transformation occurs at midnight, which is why the kidney, as a Lesser Yin organ, is also ruled by it. The five organs are Yin, and it is inappropriate to speak of them as Yang. Water flows from the kidney, so the Taiyang corresponds to the bowels; hence the Hand Taiyang is the small intestine, and the Foot Taiyang is the bladder.</p>
<p>The Great Yin channel governs the spleen and lung organs. The spleen, associated with the Yin earth element, correlates with the Great Yin pathway found in the lungs. Earth generates metal, and thus the fetus resides with the mother, which is why the lung, as a Great Yin organ, commands this relationship. Metal follows the lung; therefore, the Yangming corresponds to the bowels; thus, the Hand Yangming is the large intestine, and the Foot Yangming is the stomach.<a id="trans-640p" href="#orig-640p" class="marker">[640p]</a><br>The channel of Jueyin governs the liver and the pericardium. The liver belongs to wood and generates fire. Since the child follows the mother, the pericardium, which is governed by Jueyin, takes precedence. The fire follows the pericardium, hence Shaoyang corresponds to the organs; thus, the hand Shaoyang (San Jiao) and the foot Shaoyang (Gallbladder) are established. The channels of the hands and feet originate from both hands and feet respectively. In terms of the twelve earthly branches, yin is born in noon, which leads to the creation of the hand channels; yang is born in the rat, thus giving rise to the foot channels, serving as a record of upper and lower. Furthermore, the heart and lungs, together with the pericardium, are located above and belong to the hand channels; the liver, spleen, and kidneys are below and belong to the foot channels, which also conveys the same meaning. The organs and viscera share the hand and foot channels, forming a unity. The pericardium is not an organ, nor is the San Jiao an organ. The scripture states: &quot;The zhongwan area is the deputy official, where happiness and joy emerge.&quot; Located in the chest, between the two breasts, it is the sea of qi, but it serves as the ruler. The San Jiao functions as the bureaucratic official for the drainage, the pathway for water emerges from here. The San Jiao is named but formless, connecting the heart above and the right kidney below, governing the pathways of various qi, which are referred to as messengers.<a id="trans-641p" href="#orig-641p" class="marker">[641p]</a><br><strong>Visions of the Diagram</strong><br><strong>(Song of the Channels and Organs)</strong><br>The Sun’s meridian corresponds to the small intestine,<br>The Yangming corresponds to the large intestine and stomach.<br>The Shaoyang corresponds to the sanjiao and gallbladder,<br>The Taiyin corresponds to the lungs and spleen.<br>The Shaoyin corresponds to the heart and kidneys,<br>The Jueyin corresponds to the pericardium and liver.  </p>

These are the illnesses caused by the six qi.<a id="trans-642p" href="#orig-642p" class="marker">[642p]</a><br>According to the classic teachings, lust and resentment can overpower one if there are too few principal and guest influences present, revealing varying depths of evil within individuals. Moreover, susceptibility to external forces is simply a matter of one&#39;s constitution. Human beings, imbued with the energies of the five elements, are similarly bound by their limits. If one regulates their daily life, fosters health, and avoids malevolence while maintaining righteousness, untimely calamities can be avoided. </p>
<p>However, the seven emotions can internally disturb us, and the six external influences can affect us, leading to numerous ailments and the emergence of various diseases. Additionally, pursuing fame and fortune, indulging in desires, exhausting oneself through labor, and experiencing hunger or satiation, along with exposure to temperature extremes, braving the elements, violating taboos, and undermining one’s true spirit—these factors can surely lead to early death. It is thus to take responsibility for oneself. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;If one does not know how to maintain balance, is not timely in appeasing the spirit, and relentlessly seeks to satisfy their own desires, this is what will occur.&quot; </p>
<p>Indeed, the malevolent energies of heaven can harm one&#39;s internal organs, while the heat and cold of food can affect the six bowels. The extremes of dryness and moisture can damage the skin, flesh, and sinews. Joy and anger can injure one&#39;s vital energy, while the extremes of heat and cold can harm one&#39;s physical form. Hence, it is understood that the fluctuations of illness stem from within us. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if one is in a year of depletion, loses harmony with the times, or encounters a month of emptiness, then one is more susceptible to malevolent forces. If one is heavily affected by these evils, the risk of severe illness increases. Nevertheless, when the energies of the cosmos interact harmoniously, beneficial influences lead to health; discord leads to sickness. When epidemics arise, impacting one region or another without regard to size, this is indeed a matter of celestial influences. However, if one’s true vital energy is robust, daily activities are timely, and actions do not clash with external influences, even an epidemic will have minimal effect. This is why sages have cultivated methods for promoting life and refining the spirit.<a id="trans-643p" href="#orig-643p" class="marker">[643p]</a><br>The text discusses the relationship between the five movements and six atmospheric conditions of heaven and earth and their effects on human health. It explains that a person’s five internal organs correspond to the five elements and the yin-yang energies of the universe, thus being influenced by their fluctuations. Wang Bing believed that the energies distributed by the heavens do not exceed the five elements, suggesting that humans, being within these energies, must be aligned with the way of heaven. Therefore, it is only natural for health to vary with the changing conditions of yin and yang.</p>
<p>The text further explains how the seasonal energies can lead to various ailments, noting specific illnesses associated with each season: cold injuries in winter, heat-related illnesses in spring, summer discomfort, and autumn illnesses. These seasonal energies differ by region, resulting in different diseases. Hence, the text advocates for diverse therapeutic approaches tailored to the specifics of each illness.</p>
<p>Moreover, it acknowledges that certain diseases may occur independent of the annual climatic patterns, suggesting that practitioners should investigate the symptoms carefully without becoming overly fixated on climatic influences.</p>
<p>The &quot;Song of Diseases from the Six Qi&quot; describes various ailments associated with the six qi: </p>
<ul>
<li>Jueyin (Liver) conditions present with soft contractions and urgent pain, nausea, and diarrhea.</li>
<li>Shaoyin (Kidney) conditions exhibit cold and heat-related skin lesions, anxiety, sorrow, laughter, delusions, and neglect.</li>
<li>Taiyin (Spleen) presents as fluid retention and fullness, heavy limbs, swelling, and cholera.</li>
<li>Shaoyang (Gallbladder) issues include throat obstructions, sneezing, nausea, tinnitus, overflow, anxiety, and pain.</li>
<li>A sudden attack leads to confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, severe illness, and sudden death.</li>
<li>Yangming (Large Intestine) conditions may involve sneezing, rashes, and severe pain in the buttocks and thighs.</li>
<li>Taiyang (Bladder) conditions involve sweating, which is influenced by bending or stretching, leading to back pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This translation highlights the intricate connection between human health, environmental influences, and seasonal changes as described in the original text.<a id="trans-644p" href="#orig-644p" class="marker">[644p]</a><br><strong>On Governance by Law</strong></p>
<p>The energies of the host and guest can both lead to illness. The lower energy is that of the host, and the upper energy is that of the guest. The classic states: The host of wood is addressed with sourness for purging and with spiciness for replenishing; the guest of Jueyin is replenished with spiciness, purged by sourness, and eased by sweetness. The host of fire is addressed with sweetness for purging and with saltiness for replenishing; the guest of Shaoyin is purged by sweetness and collected by sourness; the guest of Shaoyang is replenished by saltiness, purged by sweetness, and softened by saltiness. The host of earth is purged by bitterness and replenished by sweetness; the guest of Taiyin is replenished by sweetness, purged by bitterness, and eased by sweetness. The host of metal is purged by spiciness and replenished by sourness; the guest of Yangming is replenished by sourness, purged by spiciness, and eased by bitterness. The host of water is purged by saltiness and replenished by bitterness; the guest of Taiyang is replenished by bitterness, purged by saltiness, made firm by bitterness, and moistened by spiciness. These are the supplementary and purging actions of the six energies between host and guest. If the guest is victorious, then the guest should be purged and the host replenished; if the host is victorious, then the host should be purged and the guest replenished, responding according to what is urgent and what is gentle in treatment. Furthermore, the classic contains six energies that manage the heavenly influences in treatment for excess or deficiency, as well as methods for medicinal foods appropriate to seasonal changes; thus, each situation is different, and remedies are tailored to the symptoms, following the natural order and regulating with the five flavors.<a id="trans-645p" href="#orig-645p" class="marker">[645p]</a><br>For medical practitioners, it is essential to understand the seasonal cycles, observe the physical signs, diagnose the pulse and breath, differentiate between yin and yang, and follow the principles of the classics to provide healing. Thus, there should be no concern about the accuracy of diagnosing ailments. Within the five elements, it is also necessary to address the stagnated energy by using methods to tap into the source of transformation. The &quot;Origins of the Pearl&quot; states that the Sun governs the heavens and should draw from the source of water in September; Yangming governs the heavens and should draw from the source of metal in June; Shaoyin and Shaoyang govern the heavens and should draw from the source of fire in March; Taiyin governs the heavens and should draw from the source of earth in May; Jueyin governs the heavens and should draw from the source of wood in the previous December. This method employs acupuncture to welcome and gather these energies. Therefore, it is said: Do not lose trust in the heavens, do not oppose the energies appropriately, do not hinder their strengths, and do not hinder their recovery. This is what it means to be a master in treatment.<a id="trans-646p" href="#orig-646p" class="marker">[646p]</a><br>There are indeed methods for treatment that exist, yet diseases vary in duration and severity, with some being toxic and others not, all of which relate to the principles of treatment. Some might consider that in times of certain celestial influences, when wood is strong and earth weak, one should drain the liver and nourish the spleen and stomach, but this is not a universal principle. Why is that? Can everyone’s organs be the same? For example, if the liver Qi is deficient and the spleen Qi is excessive, under such celestial influences, the liver wood may become somewhat solid, bringing the spleen Qi into balance, thus achieving harmony. However, if one insists on draining the liver and supplementing the spleen, they would confuse what is deficient and what is excessive, depleting what is lacking while reinforcing what is abundant, leading to death; it is the physician who brings this about, failing to recognize their error and inadvertently worsening the patient’s condition. Why is this so? The principles of all things in the world are such that to increase them takes time, while to diminish them happens quickly. If one takes a medicine to achieve an effect, the results will be gradual and mild; but if one consumes something that triggers illness, the response is immediate. Thus, it is evident that while establishing is difficult, destroying is easy; should we not be cautious?<a id="trans-647p" href="#orig-647p" class="marker">[647p]</a><br><strong>The Song of Six Qi: Master and Guest, Supplement and Drain</strong></p>

<h3>Discussion on Six Illnesses</h3>
<p>Understanding the operation of Yin and Yang and the six Qi,<br>Distinguishing the high and low of the southern and northern seasons,<br>Observing the victories and defeats of host and guest,<br>Examining the excess of indulgence and the recovery from depression,<br>One must first assess the pulse, then proceed to the practice.<br>If the five movements are insufficient, the victor comes to conquer;<br>If the five movements are excessive, then the defeated suffer from pathogens.<br>Heaven and earth’s six Qi interact; when they align, all is smooth; otherwise, it is adverse.<br>When the Qi harmonizes, there is health; when it does not harmonize, there is illness.<br>Only the victorious and recovering Qi of heaven and earth,<br>Is not manifested in evidence; it is the initial Qi and the three Qi of heaven’s victory,<br>And the completion of the four Qi leading to the recovery of earth.<br>This is based on Qi, not position; hence, it is not evident through observation of form.<br>Therefore, one must understand the six pulses.<br>Thus the classics state:<br>When the Jueyin reaches, its pulse is string-like;<br>When the Shaoyin reaches, its pulse is deep;<br>When the Shaoyang reaches, its pulse is large and floating;<br>When the Yangming reaches, its pulse is short and thin;<br>When the Taiyang reaches, its pulse is large and long.<br>When they reach and harmonize, it is balanced;<br>When they reach and are excessive, it causes illness.<br>Reversal upon reaching indicates illness;<br>Failure to reach indicates illness;<br>The case of being not reached yet arriving indicates illness;<br>A change of Yin and Yang indicates danger.<a id="trans-649p" href="#orig-649p" class="marker">[649p]</a><br>Those unfit for their positions are ill; those who interchange their positions are ill; those who lose their positions are in danger. This is the principle. However, in human life, although the five elements are complete within one body, vital energy is rooted internally and also ebbs and flows with the energy of heaven and earth. How can this be clarified? It can be likened to the pulse of spring as being gentle, summer as exuberant, autumn as light, and winter as heavy. People experience fortune and energy in life, and it is said they also experience illness through fortune and energy. The classics state: &quot;To go against this will cause transformation; transformation causes illness.&quot; Things respond according to their nature, and energy responds according to its nature; thus, one must observe the seasonal energy to distinguish them. </p>
<p>In the theory of common people&#39;s energies, it is said: when the sun&#39;s pulse arrives, it is robust and long; when the lesser yang&#39;s pulse arrives, it is sometimes sparse, sometimes dense, sometimes short, sometimes long; when the yangming pulse arrives, it is superficial, robust, but short. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; cites this and also discusses the three yin and three yang pulses, referring to their superficial and deep aspects as they emerge. The six pulses refer to the interactions of movement and energy, which properly align and respond at the time of their transformation. Therefore, the movement of the pulse does not remain the same; when energies and movements converge at the right time, without exceeding the balance, it is termed as normal. If there is any deviation, one must recognize the illness.<a id="trans-650p" href="#orig-650p" class="marker">[650p]</a><br><strong>On Southern and Northern Politics</strong></p>
<p>When utilizing the ten heavenly stems, the sovereign fire does not align with its cycle. Among the six energies, sovereign fire is regarded as the most honorable, while the five movements revere moist earth. Thus, the years of Jia and Ji are aligned with Southern politics, as earth establishes the numbers and connects metal, wood, water, and fire, occupying the center position. The sovereign reveres the south and issues commands, while the four other positions serve as ministers and face north to receive the orders. This creates a distinction, reflected in human meridians corresponding to this arrangement. In the years of Jia and Ji, the two movements face south; thus, in terms of the meridian, the inch is in the south while the foot is in the north. The minor yin governs the heavens, with no correspondence in the two inches, establishing south as the superior and north as the inferior. </p>
<p>This is analogous to a man facing south receiving energy, as the foot pulse is often weak; whereas a woman facing north receives energy and thus has a robust foot pulse, as the yin energy descends, leading to no correspondence. In regards to the positions of the six energies, minor yin is central, with jueyin to the right and taiyin to the left—this cannot be altered. The minor yin governs the two inches of the foot, with jueyin governing the heavens at the right, thus the right side does not correspond, while taiyin governs the heavens at the left, consequently, the left side does not correspond either, based on Southern politics when discussing the measurements. </p>
<p>If one further examines through hand diagnosis, the yin sinks below, reversing becomes floating, and fine becomes extensive. Furthermore, the text states: the opposing inch signifies death, the intersection of yin and yang signifies death. One must first establish the year to understand its energy and observe the responses on both sides before discussing the reversals and alignments of death and life. Further examination is needed to distinguish its reversals, detailing its intersections, and only then is it possible to delve into the subtleties of life and death.</p>

<p>【The song says: Earth, positioned in the south, is called the ruler; fire, metal, wood, and water in the north are the ministers. One must respect the moist earth in its noble position, while the six energies still prioritize the ruler of fire.】</p>
<p>Discussing the physiological influences according to measurements shall not contradict the stated principles.</p>
<p>The text states: When yin and yang intersect, it leads to death. If the year is supposed to be yang, a pulse on the left will oddly present on the right; if the year is supposed to be yin, a pulse on the right will oddly present on the left. When both sides meet, this is called intersection. If the left is solely present, or the right is solely present, it is not responsive and does not qualify as intersection. Only in the years of Yin (Tiger), Shen (Monkey), Si (Snake), Hai (Pig), Chen (Dragon), Xu (Dog), Chou (Ox), and Wei (Goat) occurs this phenomenon. The text states: When measurements are reversed, it indicates death. If the year is supposed to be yin, the measurement should show a pulse at the wrist but appears at the finger; if the year is supposed to be yang, the measurement should show at the finger but appears at the wrist. When both measurements are reversed, it is termed as reversal. If only the wrist appears, or only the finger appears, it is not responsive and does not qualify as reversal. This phenomenon only occurs in the years of Zi (Rat), Wu (Horse), Mao (Rabbit), and You (Rooster). The essence of creation transforms accordingly; thus, qi and blood become chaotic and lead to illness. The text states: Firstly, establish the year to understand the qi; when both sides react, one can discuss the oppositions and harmonies of life and death. This serves as an example, with the same methods applying to other years. Inadequate practitioners confuse cold with heat, treating cold as heat, yet the pulse remains unchanged and heat sickness arises, then they treat heat as cold, yet the pulse reflects this and cold sickness again appears. How can one seek balance under such conditions? The reasons for premature death largely stem from this. </p>
<p>All three yin and three yang energies in charge of the heavens reside in the spring, governing the north-south dynamics, whether on the left or right. The pulse in both the wrist and finger should be downward; if they do not correspond closely, reversing the hand will show a sinking pulse as floating, turning fine into coarse.<a id="trans-652p" href="#orig-652p" class="marker">[652p]</a><br>The interplay of the pulse at the wrist reveals death.</p>
<p>When the Taiyin governs the heavens, the yin pulse should ordinarily appear at the left wrist, but if it instead shows at the right, this means the yang pulse has shifted to the left wrist, indicating the intersection of yin and yang, which signifies death. If the left shows only the yin pulse and the right one is absent, or if the right shows only the yang pulse and the left is absent, this does not correspond to the yin energy and simply indicates illness. The same applies to both wrists. This phenomenon occurs during specific years: the years of Yin, Shen, Si, Hai, Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei.</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin governs the heavens, the yin pulse should appear at both wrists, but if it instead shows at both hands, this indicates that the yang pulse has shifted to both wrists, signaling a reversal, which signifies death. The same applies to both wrists. The interpretation of the pulses remains consistent as mentioned above. This occurs only in the years of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You.<a id="trans-653p" href="#orig-653p" class="marker">[653p]</a><br>Song of the Measures and Reversed Pulse</p>
<p>Left inch meets right, right meets left; right chi meets left, left meets right. Two inches alternate with two chi&#39;s region, two chi&#39;s alternate with two inches&#39; guardianship. </p>
<p>The southern and northern political measures of pulses are unresponsive in their diagrams.</p>
<p>[The pulse being unresponsive refers to where Yin resides, causing the pulse to be deep and thin, as it does not correspond to the original pulse. If one examines with their hands, then what was deep becomes superficial and what was thin becomes large. The measures of the inches and chi&#39;s have no upper or lower distinction; the use of &#39;upper&#39; and &#39;lower&#39; here serves to differentiate the southern and northern political authorities, where &#39;Tian&#39; reigns over &#39;Quan&#39;.]</p>
<p>[The song says: In the southern polity, the inch is above and the chi is below; in the northern polity, the inch is above and the chi below is hindered. The three Yin authorities of heaven do not respond above; at &#39;Quan&#39; below there is no response. The Tai Yin must examine the left inch and chi; the Jue Yin holds the right hand&#39;s measures. The Shao Yin pulse is associated with both inches and chi; this principle is subtle and truly difficult to understand.]</p>
<p>[Note: The unresponsive pulse specifically refers to the three Yin. However, since Shao Yin is the ruler, it governs both the two inches and two chi&#39;s. Thus, the Shao Yin presides over heaven, where the two inches do not respond, and at &#39;Quan&#39;, the two chi&#39;s do not respond.]<a id="trans-654p" href="#orig-654p" class="marker">[654p]</a><br>The left hand&#39;s chi (pulse) corresponds to the Taiyin, thus Taiyin governs the heavens. If the left cun (inch) does not respond, the Taiyin is at the spring; if the left zhi (inch) does not respond, it is the same. The right hand&#39;s chi corresponds to the Jueyin, thus Jueyin governs the heavens. If the right cun does not respond, Jueyin is at the spring; if the right zhi does not respond, it is the same. One should observe the locations of the three Yin, with the governing aspects of heaven at cun and the governing aspects of the spring at zhi, regardless of southern or northern governance; this is the essential principle.</p>
<p>A patient was diagnosed with a non-responsive left zhi and was thought to have exhausted Kidney Qi, facing imminent death. Another doctor examined and found the face to bear Yang, with the qi at the mouth being string-like and elongated, indicating a collective illness from the three Yang of cold damage. The patient also experienced fright from a wind while crossing the sea, leading to blood stagnation and spiritual distress. Under heat aggression, they vomited blood and experienced side pain, thirst, and delirium. A prescription of Xiao Chai Hu Tang was given, with the addition of Sheng Di; after waiting for the stomach to become firm, a purgative was administered, resulting in recovery. At that time, the annual movement of the left zhi should not respond, indicating this is a heavenly harmony pulse rather than an absolute exhaustion of the kidneys.<a id="trans-655p" href="#orig-655p" class="marker">[655p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Major and Minor Cyclicities</strong></p>
<p>There are major and minor cycles; the major cycle is established by the annual stem and governs the year, which is considered the major cycle. It may begin at the Great Cold or the Lesser Cold, each deriving from the Great Cold day, subsequently generating one another until concluding at the Feathers. Each cycle controls seventy-three days and five quarters, totaling five cycles, which equals three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five quarters, constituting a year, regarded as the minor cycle. </p>
<p>The minor cycles are governed by the major cycles. In Yang years, it belongs to the Great, while in Yin years, it belongs to the Lesser. The upper elements generate until the Point and cease; the lower elements generate until the Feathers and cease. The mutual generation of upper and lower must rely upon the Great and the Lesser, and must not lose their order. </p>
<p>If the cycle of Jia pertains to the Great Earth, then the upper generates the Great Earth, which leads to the Lesser Fire; the generation of the Lesser leading to the Great is identified with the upper generating until the Point. Furthermore, the Great Earth below generates the Lesser Metal, which in turn produces the Great Water at the Feathers; this is termed the lower generating until the Feathers. </p>
<p>When Jia and Ji combine, Ji derives from the Lesser cycle, promoting mutual generation among the upper and lower.<a id="trans-656p" href="#orig-656p" class="marker">[656p]</a><br>In the case of the Yi cycle, the Lesser Metal of Shang gives birth to the Great Earth of Tai Gong; the Great Earth of Tai Gong gives rise to the Lesser Fire of Zheng; the Lesser Fire of Zheng leads to the Great Wood of Jiao. This is also referred to as the upper giving rise to the Jiao. Furthermore, the Lesser Metal of Shang beneath arises from the Great Water of Tai Yu, which is also described as the lower giving rise to the Yu.</p>
<p>When Yi combines with Geng, Geng is influenced by the birth from the upper and lower of Tai Shang. Similarly, in the Bing cycle, the Great Water of Tai Yu above gives rise to the Lesser Metal of Shang; the Lesser Metal of Shang generates the Great Earth of Tai Gong; the Great Earth of Tai Gong produces the Lesser Fire of Zheng; the Lesser Fire of Zheng leads to the Great Wood of Jiao. This is called the upper giving rise to the Jiao. When Bing combines with Xin, Xin is influenced by the birth from the upper of Shao Yu.</p>
<p>In the case of the Ding cycle, the Lesser Wood of Jiao below generates the Lesser Fire of Zheng; the Fire gives rise to the Lesser Earth of Gong; the Earth produces the Lesser Metal of Shang; the Metal leads to the Lesser Water of Yu. This is referred to as the lower giving rise to the Yu. When Ding combines with Ren, Ren is influenced by the birth from the lower of Tai Jiao.</p>
<p>In the Wu cycle, the Great Fire of Zheng above gives rise to the Lesser Wood of Jiao; the Greater Fire below generates the Lesser Earth of Gong; the Earth produces the Greater Metal of Shang; the Metal gives birth to the Lesser Water of Yu. This is described as the upper giving rise to the Jiao and the lower giving rise to the Yu. When Wu combines with Gui, Gui is influenced by the birth from the upper and lower of Tai Zheng.<a id="trans-657p" href="#orig-657p" class="marker">[657p]</a><br>Thus, year by year, the principal operations are based on the major cycles. Either the Great Horn serves as the beginning, with the Great Tail as the end; or the Lesser Horn as the beginning, with the Lesser Tail as the end. In total, at each of the major cycle&#39;s Horn points, the character for &quot;beginning&quot; is inscribed, and at the Tail points, the character for &quot;end&quot; is inscribed, further indicating to others the nature of the principal operations distinguished by the Great and Lesser Horns and Tails, and their beginnings and ends.</p>
<p>In the years of Jia, Yi, Bing, Ren, and Gui, there is the Great Horn. Wood serves as the initial operation, spanning seventy-three days, starting from the Winter Solstice and concluding thirteen days after the Spring Equinox. The Lesser Zheng Fire represents the second operation, also spanning seventy-three days, commencing thirteen days after the Spring Equinox and ending twenty-five days after the Grain Buds. The Great Palace Earth serves as the third operation, lasting seventy-three days, beginning twenty-five days after the Grain Buds and ending thirty-seven days after the Major Heat. The Lesser Merchant Metal represents the fourth operation, lasting seventy-three days, beginning thirty-seven days after the Major Heat and concluding forty-nine days after the Autumnal Equinox. The Great Tail Water denotes the final operation, lasting seventy-three days, commencing forty-nine days after the Autumnal Equinox and concluding with the Winter Solstice.<a id="trans-658p" href="#orig-658p" class="marker">[658p]</a><br>In the fifth year of the Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, and Ding cycles, the initial operation involves the Lesser Wood, the second operation involves the Great Fire, the third operation involves the Lesser Earth, the fourth operation involves the Great Metal, and the final operation involves the Lesser Water. According to the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Book,&quot; there is also the guest operation of the year, which functions atop the main operations and is aligned with the methods of the six qi of main and guest. Therefore, it is said that the guest operation among the years typically corresponds to the initial operation of the first twenty days.</p>
<p>On the day of the Great Cold in the years of Shen, Zi, and Chen, the initial exchange occurs at Yin. On the day of the Great Cold in the years of Hai, Mao, and Wei, the initial exchange occurs at Hai. On the day of the Great Cold in the years of Yin, Wu, and Xu, the initial exchange occurs at Shen. On the day of the Great Cold in the years of Si, You, and Chou, the initial exchange occurs at Si.</p>
<p>[These five operations mutually generate and measure the year. Yet, their application is not seen in the texts. From the perspective of the six qi, the operations correspond to their main qi to execute the heavenly mandate. Indeed, the operations of the five elements have one main qi; they should dominate the fourth without fail in the process of transformation. However, the major operation of the year aligns with the main operation of the one year, similar to how the deity of heaven connects with the main operation of the first half of the year. The &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Book&quot; speaks of the guest of the five operations, mutually governing one year, thus it is clear that the content of the scriptures pertains to the main operation of each year. Hence, one should follow the &quot;Jade Book&quot; as a standard.] </p>

Song of the Major Fortunes by Time and Date: The great cold begins the true Wood cycle, before the Qingming, Fire is utilized warmly. At Grain Full, ten days should reveal Earth, at the beginning of Autumn, consider the second correlating with Metal.

The five movements follow in succession to the main position, adding year by year as indicated.

<p><strong>Major and Minor Cycles Correlation Song:</strong><br>First, differentiate the major cycles, whether too much or too little; the major cycles give rise to the yearly tones. The five tones are projected upward based on the own cases, with the major and minor being interconnected under certain angles. At the beginning of the angle, it takes flight at the year of the movement, where major and minor succeed in the descending layout. In the year of wood, the angle initially aligns with the major cycle, and the minor next is also linked in descent.</p>
<p><strong>Five Movements of Yin and Yang Transformation Song:</strong><br>The excessive movement of the five is purely one transformation; the positive is indeed yang and should not be overlooked. Self-restraint leads to the same transformation degree, while if the movement is insufficient, it becomes negative. </p>
<p><em>Note: &quot;Degree&quot; refers to the sun. &quot;One transformation&quot; signifies the yang year of the major cycle.</em><a id="trans-661p" href="#orig-661p" class="marker">[661p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Proper and Erroneous Transformations</h3>
<p>If the year of Jiazi belongs to fire, it is associated with heat transformation and is governed by heaven; Jia, associated with earth, corresponds to rain transformation and is governed by movement; and Yin, associated with metal, corresponds to clear transformation and is governed by the earth. Heat transformation, rain transformation, and clear transformation are all essential energies governed by heaven, movement, and earth, hence they are called proper transformations. Moreover, Jia is associated with the positive (yang) and signifies excess; when there is excess, there is neither triumph nor return, hence there is no erroneous transformation. Generally, when encountering a yang year representing excess, the five elements often indicate numerical values; thus, it is said heat transformation is seven, rain transformation is five, and clear transformation is nine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the year of Xinyin, associated with metal, it represents clear transformation governed by heaven; Xinyin water represents cold transformation and is governed by movement; and the Zi fire, representing heat transformation, is governed by the earth. Clear transformation, cold transformation, and heat transformation are all essential energies governed by heaven, movement, and earth, hence they are also called proper transformations. However, Xinyin water belongs to the negative (yin) and signifies insufficiency; when there is insufficiency, the transformation of earth into rain will inevitably oppose it. Weak water cannot withstand, and the water&#39;s offspring—the wooden wind transformation—will inevitably return to oppose and overpower the earth. Nevertheless, what is opposed by rain and transformed by wind are not the essential energies of heaven, movement, and earth, hence they are called erroneous transformations. Although rain transformation and wind transformation are not essential energies, one prevails and the other is defeated, making it an inevitable principle. Thus, in any year of insufficiency (yin year), where the five elements often indicate birthing values, it is said clear transformation is four, cold transformation is one, and heat transformation is two.<a id="trans-662p" href="#orig-662p" class="marker">[662p]</a><br><strong>On the Principal Movement of the Upper and Lower Elements Being Predominantly Lesser</strong></p>
<p>If in a given year, the element of Yang Earth governs as the Supreme Palace, then the Earth of the Supreme Palace is the main focus. Therefore, what is produced by the Supreme Palace and what comes from it both stem from the Lesser aspect, not the Supreme. Thus, what the Supreme Palace Earth produces is the Lesser Metal of Shàng, and what the Lesser Metal of Shàng produces is the Supreme Water of Yǔ; when it encounters Yǔ, it comes to an end. Additionally, what is produced by the Supreme Palace Earth is the Lesser Fire of Zhēng, and what the Lesser Fire of Zhēng produces is the Supreme Wood of Jiǎo; when it encounters Jiǎo, it also reaches a halt. In summary, in the case of a Yang year, the movements of the upper and lower elements are all derived from the Lesser, hence it is said that the Supreme and Lesser mutually generate each other.</p>
<p>Conversely, if in a given year the element of Yin Earth governs as the Lesser Palace, then the Earth of the Lesser Palace is the primary focus. In this scenario, what is produced by the Lesser Palace and what comes from it are both rooted in the Supreme, not the Lesser. Thus, what the Lesser Palace Earth produces is the Supreme Metal of Shàng, and what the Supreme Metal of Shàng produces is the Lesser Water of Yǔ; encountering Yǔ, it ends once more. Furthermore, what is produced by the Lesser Palace Earth is the Supreme Fire of Zhēng, and what the Supreme Fire of Zhēng produces is the Lesser Wood of Jiǎo; meeting Jiǎo, it likewise ceases. Therefore, in Yin years, the movements of the upper and lower elements are all drawn from the Supreme, thus it is again said that the Supreme and Lesser mutually generate each other.</p>
<p>Additionally, regardless of whether it is a Yang or Yin year, one writes an initial character under Jiǎo and a terminal character under Yǔ; for each year, the Wood of Jiǎo represents the initial movement, and the Water of Yǔ represents the terminal movement. This pattern remains consistent year after year, thus forming the principal movement. Just like the principal Qi, year after year, Wood signifies the initial movement and Water the terminal Qi, and this uniformity leads to it being termed the principal Qi.<a id="trans-663p" href="#orig-663p" class="marker">[663p]</a><br><strong>Disaster Palace Song:</strong></p>
<p>In years without sufficient fortune, there are positions of disaster palace. The yin and yang align with three, while five associates with the same. The seven numbers are few, mixed with the乙 (Yi) and 癸 (Gui) corresponding with nine, still using earth to support the second position of the Kun. The second is indeed the position of earth, not the number of disaster officials. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Nine Palaces’ Domains:</strong></p>
<p>It is said: In years when the five movements are insufficient, there are positions the disaster palace points to, thus one cannot make a blanket statement about disasters. The classics say: The nine stars hang brightly, the seven luminaries rotate, under heaven&#39;s dominion. The nine stars divide the domains, thus in less auspicious years it is said there are disasters in the three palaces; the eastern palace, representing the shock position, is under the jurisdiction of Tian Chong. In less favorable years, it is said there are disasters in the nine palaces; the southern chamber, where the departure position is overseen by Tian Ying. In less fortunate years, it is said there are disasters in the five palaces; the central chamber is under the authority of Tian Qin. The second palace, Kun position, is affiliated. In less advantageous years, it is said there are disasters in the seven palaces; the western chamber, where the joy position is governed by Tian Zhu. In less propitious years, it is said there are disasters in the one palace; the northern chamber, where the pit position is ruled by Tian Peng. </p>
<p>First, it discusses the aspect of fortune&#39;s insufficiency. According to the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Volume,&quot; it states: Tian Peng is associated with water, being the central palace; Tian Rui, associated with earth, is the responding palace. Tian Chong, associated with wood, is the central palace. Tian Fu, also associated with wood, is the responding palace. Tian Qin, associated with earth, is the central palace. Tian Xin, associated with metal, is the responding palace. Tian Zhu, associated with metal, is the central palace. Tian Ren, associated with fire, is the responding palace. Tian Ying, associated with fire, is the central palace. Then align this with the divisions in the nine provinces, namely Yan, Ji, Yan, Qing, Yang, Jing, Yu, Liang, Yong.<a id="trans-664p" href="#orig-664p" class="marker">[664p]</a><br><strong>The Twelve Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches</strong></p>
<p>The first of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches is Jiazi. Yang precedes Yin, following the cycle. If Jiazi is Yang, then Yichou is Yin; Yang marries a Yang partner and Yin marries a Yin partner, as when Jiazi marries Yichou. Offspring are produced, meaning Jiazi gives rise to Renzi at an interval of eight, and Renzi produces Gengchen, all three being of the Metal element, which corresponds to the Zi. The other children have similar meanings. Next, Wuzi Fire produces three generations leading to Wood, Wood produces three generations leading to Water, Water produces three generations leading to Earth, and Earth culminates at three, then returning to Jiawu Metal which produces three generations leading to Wuwu Fire, completing the cycle of the twelve branches, each containing the five tones. For example, in the Zi branch, there are Jiazi Metal, Bingzi Water, Wuzi Fire, Gengzi Earth, and Renzi Wood. The Six Jias encompass sixty tones. The interval of eight does not refer to the eighth directly; for instance, Jiazi to Guichou encompasses ten positions concerning earlier ranks. This is known as the Law of Jia, and in the cycles, it does not reach full application for use. </p>

Jia metal, Bing water, Wu fire, Geng earth, and Ren come together.】<br>From the Theory of the Six Qi【Ming, Wang Huan】  </p>
<p>【The principles of the classics involve many interpretations that overflow with meaning. I have often observed the subtle ideas in the text of the Six Transformations and the sequence of diagrams, alongside the discussion of the lesser yang, where the fire qi is governed. The concepts therein might remain obscure and undisclosed, and yet, interpreters have erroneously misled others. Nonetheless, it is said that the essence is beneath, within the observation, and the visibility is indicative of the qi. There are also those who operate from the essence, from visibility, from the end, and from the internal, duly illuminating the three qi in alternating phases, thus allowing for subtle meanings to be examined further. Therefore, I refer to the principles of the classics, complement my own observations, and append the differences and similarities of essence and visibility to explore their connections. I do not presume to be the authoritative voice. However, it could also serve as an enlightening understanding for those engulfed in confusion.】  The Diagram of Lesser Yang from the Essence<br>Seeing the diagram<br>The Diagram of the Greater Yin from the Essence<br>Seeing the diagram<br>The Diagram of the Lesser Yin from the Essence and Visibility<br>Seeing the diagram<br>The Diagram of the Greater Yang from the Essence and Visibility<br>Seeing the diagram<br>The Diagram of Yangming from the Internal<br>Seeing the diagram<br>The Diagram of Jueyin from the Internal<br>Seeing the diagram  </p>
<p>Explaining the Disorders and Treatments of Qi and Essence<a id="trans-666p" href="#orig-666p" class="marker">[666p]</a><br>In the &quot;Suwen&quot; chapter on the Subtle Principles, the Emperor said: &quot;I wish to know the six seasonal patterns of the heavenly way, and how do they reflect prosperity and decline?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There are ranks above and below, and there are records left and right. Thus, to the right of Shaoyang, the Yangming governs; to the right of Yangming, the Taiyang governs; to the right of Taiyang, the Jueyin governs; to the right of Jueyin, the Shaoyin governs; to the right of Shaoyin, the Taiyin governs; to the right of Taiyin, the Shaoyang governs. This is known as the standard of Qi, which faces south and awaits it. Therefore, it is said to follow the order of heaven; during periods of prosperity and decline, we move and properly position ourselves, waiting correctly—this is what is meant. Above Shaoyang, the fire Qi governs, revealing Shaoyin in the center; above Yangming, the dry Qi governs, revealing Taiyin in the center; above Taiyang, the cold Qi governs, revealing Shaoyin in the center; above Jueyin, the wind Qi governs, revealing Shaoyang in the center; above Shaoyin, the heat Qi governs, revealing Taiyang in the center; above Taiyin, the damp Qi governs, revealing Yangming in the center. This is what is called the root. Below the root, the center reveals; below the revealed, the standard of Qi. The standard and the root are different, leading to various manifestations of Qi. In the &quot;Great Discussion of Essential Truth,&quot; the Emperor asked: &quot;How do the six Qi derive from different standards and roots?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;Qi comes from the root, from the standard root, and sometimes does not come from the standard root. Shaoyang and Taiyin come from the root; Shaoyin and Taiyang come from both the root and the standard; Yangming and Jueyin do not come from the standard root, but rather from the center. Hence, those that come from the root transform according to the root; those that come from the standard root have transformations based on the standard root; those that come from the center rely on the central Qi for transformation.&quot;<a id="trans-667p" href="#orig-667p" class="marker">[667p]</a><br>Wang noted: The origin of Shaoyang is fire, and the origin of Taiyin is dampness; since they share the same root, we follow the root. The origin of Shaoyin is heat, which is categorized as yin, while the origin of Taiyang is cold, categorized as yang. Since their roots are different, we categorize according to the sign and then the root. In Yangming, Taiyin is in the middle, and in Jueyin, Shaoyang is in the middle; since the root and the middle are different, we do not follow the signs or the roots, but rather focus on the middle. Hua noted: Yangming is fundamentally dry, with dampness in the middle categorized as yang; Jueyin is fundamentally windy, with fire in the middle categorized as yin. Only these two channels have different roots and middles, thus the treatment follows the root. The officials refer to the six qi as those that move between heaven and earth, implementing virtues and governing policies. As for the years of balanced qi (like Dingyin, Wumao, Jiachen, Jiaxu, Jichou, Jimai, Bingzi, and similar), these are referred to as years of balanced qi.<a id="trans-668p" href="#orig-668p" class="marker">[668p]</a><br>Things are born and respond to the meridians; the qi transforms and each attains its normal state. However, if the seasonal qi is excessive or insufficient, there will be changes of victory and defeat, leading to the emergence of illnesses as people interact with the shifting energies around them. In treatment, there are distinctions among the fundamental, the symptomatic, and the intermediary. Although this discussion can be seen in the various writings on the dynamics of qi, it is essentially reflective of the relationships between the classics and the treatment of organ syndromes.</p>
<p>Examining the classics, one finds that the six transformations of heaven, characterized by cold, heat, dryness, moisture, wind, and fire, serve as the foundation, while the three yin and three yang positions serve as the markers. What is referred to as &#39;the middle seen&#39; reflects the interconnection of yin and yang, mutually influencing each other. Following the celestial order and the timing of flourishing and decline, one adjusts oneself to the correct position and awaits.</p>
<p>In this transformation of qi, reverence is shown; facing south is fundamental, responding to heaven above; beneath this foundation, the qi that is perceived to the north corresponds to humanity in the middle; and below this, the indicators of the lower three yin and three yang are placed, corresponding to the earth below.<a id="trans-669p" href="#orig-669p" class="marker">[669p]</a><br>The essence of the sign has not yet become clear. I foolishly speculate on this. The position of the sign corresponds to the six energies of the earth. For instance, the initial phase corresponds to the wind and wood, the second to fire of the two lords, the third to fiery heat, the fourth to moist earth, the fifth to dry metal, and ultimately to cold water. Since the responses below the earth’s energies differ, the influences of the three yin and three yang will also change accordingly. This illustrates the difference between the sign and the essence, leading to differing phenomena in their responses. Furthermore, in the principles of cosmic creation, yang represents advancement, hence nine signifies maturity; yin represents retreat, hence six signifies maturity. Therefore, wherever the essential energy resides, one must closely examine the yin and yang of its original position regarding advancement and retreat, always moving counterclockwise from wood and wind. When it manifests from the energy of the lower sign, it becomes the domain of the sign; thus, we can observe the essence and order of the three talents’ energies.<a id="trans-670p" href="#orig-670p" class="marker">[670p]</a><br>When the representative and the original are the same, they mutually represent one another; conversely, those that differ originate from the interstice. For example, above the Shaoyang, the fire is the original essence, and within it, the Jueyin wood winds are observed; the wind serves as the middle essence while the Shaoyang stands as the representative. Thus, from the position of Shaoyang to Yangming, it is regarded as the initial earth essence of the wind and wood, proceeding left in sequence until reaching the lower representative position. At the convergence of the three energies, the fire responds to this, hence both the representative and the original are fire, and thus it follows the original fire. Similarly, above the Taiyin, the humid essence is the original, and within it, the dryness of Yangming gold is observed; dryness serves as the middle essence while the Taiyin stands as the representative. Thus, from the position of Taiyin to Shaoyin, it is regarded as the initial earth essence of the wind and wood, proceeding left in sequence until reaching the lower representative position. At the convergence of the four energies, the humid earth responds to this, hence both the representative and the original are humid, and thus it follows the original humidity. Therefore, the Shaoyang and Taiyin both represent the same essence, which is why it is discussed as originating from the transformation within the original.<a id="trans-671p" href="#orig-671p" class="marker">[671p]</a><br>In the case of the Lesser Yin, heat is the origin; when one observes the cold water of the Greater Yang, the cold is considered the central energy, with the Lesser Yin as the standard. The Lesser Yin should retreat to the right, and counting to the left, the final energy of the cold water occupies the position of the standard, and the standard of the Lesser Yin also transforms from cold. This is rooted in heat while the standard is cold, thus wherever the Lesser Yin reaches, it brings forth heat, and the center is treated with cold—sometimes following heat and sometimes cold.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case of the Greater Yang, cold is the origin; when one observes the warm energy of the Lesser Yin, the warmth is deemed the central energy, with the Greater Yang as the standard. The Greater Yang should advance to the left, and counting forward, the two energies of the sovereign fire occupy the position of the standard, and the standard of the Greater Yang also transforms to warmth. This is rooted in cold while the standard is warm, hence wherever the Greater Yang reaches, it fosters cold, and the center is treated with moisture—sometimes following cold and sometimes warmth.<a id="trans-672p" href="#orig-672p" class="marker">[672p]</a><br>The Shaoyin and Taiyang are mutually the principal and secondary, hence they are discussed in terms of their transformation as primary and secondary. Similarly, above the Yangming, the dryness is the essence, while the Taiyin’s moist earth is seen as the central energy, with moisture as the central quality and Yangming as the secondary. Starting from the Taiyang on the left position of Yangming, one moves left in order, until reaching the lower mark position. When aligned with the four energies, the moist earth corresponds. Thus, the Yangming marked also transforms from moisture. This is originally dry, but marked by moisture; hence, the essence and mark are different, and do not follow the essence but are based on the central moisture. </p>
<p>Moreover, above the Jueyin, the wind is the essence; within this, the Shaoyang fire energy is present. Fire is the central energy, while Jueyin serves as the mark. Starting from the Taiyang on the right position of Jueyin, one moves left in order until reaching the lower mark position. When aligned with the five energies, the dry metal corresponds. Thus, the Jueyin marked also transforms from dryness. This is originally wind, but marked by dryness; hence, the essence and mark are different, and do not follow the essence but are based on the central fire.<a id="trans-673p" href="#orig-673p" class="marker">[673p]</a><br>The differentiation between Yangming and Jueyin lies in their fundamental nature, considering the transformation through the central energy. All of this adheres to natural laws, which cannot be altered by human intention. In summary: Taiyin and Yangming are connected to dampness; Shaoyin and Taiyang pertain to heat and cold; Jueyin and Shaoyang relate to fire. </p>
<p>Now, discussing the treatment related to Taiyin and Yangming, when the hand Taiyin lung is affected by dampness, symptoms may include wheezing and a voice that sounds as if emerging from a jar; treatments involve the use of herbs like 腾苈 and 木通. Additionally, the foot Taiyin spleen can be affected by dampness leading to fullness, treated with pills like 大消痞丸. Symptoms such as limbs swelling and feeling like clay can be managed with formulas like 胃苓汤. For cases presenting with heaviness in the body and a desire to lie down, treatments may include herbs like 苍术 and 羌活. </p>
<p>Moreover, the foot Yangming stomach may also suffer from stagnation due to water intake, causing chest and abdominal fullness, or difficulties in swallowing water, treated with 五苓散 plus 半夏; in severe cases, herbs like 牵牛 and 甘遂 are employed. The Yangming stomach channel affected by dampness may lead to facial swelling, again treated with 苍术 and 羌活. In the case of hand Yangming experiencing dominance of dampness manifesting as diarrhea, the course of treatment would follow with formulas like 五苓散.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when treating Shaoyin and Taiyang through heat and cold, if the hand Shaoyin heart shows signs of heat and a lack of tranquility in the spirit, treatments may include朱砂安神丸. In cases involving sores or mid-day fevers where heat is present in the blood vessels, 黄连泻心汤 is often utilized.<a id="trans-674p" href="#orig-674p" class="marker">[674p]</a><br>If there is excessive heat in the stomach channel affecting the heart, resulting in delirium, it is treated with a formula similar to Da Chengqi Decoction. If there is early heart convulsion due to cold damage leading to fullness and distension, it is treated with Huanglian and Zhi Shi. The classics say: &quot;For abdominal fullness, this is treated by purging internally.&quot; If there is stagnation beneath the heart, Da Chengqi Decoction is the primary treatment. </p>
<p>If there is extreme heart fire in the Lesser Yin leading to chills and shivering, this is fundamentally heat presenting as cold, and it is treated with formulas to dispel fire. If there is heart deficiency with cold in the Lesser Yin leading to aversion to cold, it is treated with Ginseng, Aconite, and Red Stone Fat. This is what Wang Taifu proposed to increase fire to dispel yin turbidity. </p>
<p>If there is kidney heat in the Lesser Yin causing seminal emission, it is treated with Pearl Pill combined with Sophora Root Bark. If there is agitation of the heart, it is treated with ingredients like Zhimu.<a id="trans-675p" href="#orig-675p" class="marker">[675p]</a><br>If there is pathogenic cold affecting the少阴 kidney channel, leading to symptoms such as dry mouth and dry tongue, the treatment should involve formulas similar to Guizhi Decoction. If there is cold in the少阴 kidney causing body and joint pain, cold hands and feet, and a deep pulse, the treatment should employ formulas similar to Fuzi Decoction. The text states: for a deep pulse with accompanying illness, what is the diagnosis? Qibo replies: when the pulse is present but weak, and upon pressing it does not rebound, with all yang aspects similar, this is the case. If there are cold and heat symptoms in the hands and feet related to the taiyang small intestine and bladder, resulting in frequent, unobstructed, and cold urination with chills and subsequent resolution, the treatment should involve formulas similar to Shengfu Decoction. There may be symptoms such as clear urine, incontinence, or prolonged discharge with turbidity; the treatment should use formulas related to Jiangfu. There are also cases of virtual cold in the taiyang bladder channel with a floating pulse, slight sweating with a dislike of cold, frequent urination, and feelings of agitation; the treatment should involve formulas similar to Guizhi Decoction with Fuzi. Lastly, for heat in the taiyang small intestine and bladder channels resulting in difficulties urinating, the treatment should include Huangbai and Zhimu formulas.<a id="trans-676p" href="#orig-676p" class="marker">[676p]</a><br>The scripture states: When the small intestine transfers heat to the bladder, leading to difficulty with the diaphragm and intestines, this is the cause. It may present with symptoms such as painful urination, hematuria, or turbid urine due to heat. For treatment, use Huangbai (Phellodendron), Zhimu (Anemarrhena), and Zhizi (Gardenia). The scripture also mentions: When heat from the uterus shifts to the bladder causing hematuria, this is another manifestation. Additionally, there may be a fire evil in the bladder at the Taiyang region, resulting in redness and swelling in the feet and knees; for this, the treatment includes Danggui (Angelica), Sheng Dihuang (Raw Rehmannia), Huangbai, Longdancao (Gentian), Fangji (Stephania), Cangzhu (Atractylodes), and Honghua (Safflower). Furthermore, in cases of typhoid fever accompanied by chills, fever, and severe headache radiating to the bladder, with symptoms of red and painful urination, this is fundamentally a cold condition presenting a hot symptom. First, use Mahuang Decoction to resolve it, then apply Wuling Powder to promote urination. The scripture states: When a disease arises with excess, treat the root first and then the branch; this is the principle to follow.<a id="trans-677p" href="#orig-677p" class="marker">[677p]</a><br>There are also cases where external evil from the excess heat of the Yang channels enters the interior, leading to diarrhea and a clear, watery discharge. This may cause abdominal bloating, chills, fever, headaches, and body aches, with surface symptoms still present. This is fundamentally heat but manifests as cold; therefore, one should first use ginger-tinged soup to warm the body, followed by cinnamon twig decoction to resolve it. The classics say: when illness arises and there is deficiency, addressing both the surface and the root, one should first treat the surface and then the root. This treatment pertains to conditions resulting from the interplay of the lesser Yin and greater Yang due to heat and cold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding treatments from the lesser Yin and lesser Yang relating to fire, if there is heat in the hand’s lesser Yin meridian causing palm heat, the treatment should include substances such as bupleurum, scutellaria, coptis, and forsythia. For conditions such as heat in the lesser Yang&#39;s sanjiao organ, the treatment includes three replenishing pills or similar remedies. If heat arises from the left flank causing pain, the treatment should involve substances like Dong quai and dragon gall pills or similar.<a id="trans-678p" href="#orig-678p" class="marker">[678p]</a><br>There are also cases where children experience convulsions due to the liver being affected by wind-heat, which can be treated with tranquilizing pills or similar remedies. There are cases of heat in the foot Shaoyang gallbladder leading to a bitter mouth, treatable with Chaihu and Huangqin or similar herbs. When liver heat causes bitterness and gallbladder heat resulting in excessive sleepiness, it can be treated with raw sour jujube seeds and bitter tea or similar solutions. For conditions related to the hand and foot Shaoyang meridians where residual heat causes deafness and pain in the chest and sides, Xiao Chaihu Decoction or similar remedies are effective. In instances of tinnitus, clear air and phlegm-reducing pills can be used. In cases of scrofula, breaking knots and dispersing remedies are appropriate. For rashes, Lianqiao and Fangfeng Decoction or similar formulas are recommended. Patients with chills and fever due to malaria can be treated with Clear Spleen Decoction or similar options. For conditions involving throat obstructions, a decoction of sweet mandarin peel is effective, combined with Fangfeng, Jingjie, Gardenia, Perilla, and Tianhuafen or similar herbs. All these treatments pertain to conditions caused by the interaction of Jueyin and Shaoyang with fire.<a id="trans-679p" href="#orig-679p" class="marker">[679p]</a><br>Thus, the &quot;Elementary Learning&quot; states: the liver and gallbladder are governed by fire, and the three burners and heart are no different. The spleen and stomach usually seek moisture, while the lungs and large intestine share this moisture. The heart, kidneys, small intestine, and bladder all follow the balance of cold and heat. This is the essence of the matter. </p>
<p>As for the explanations by the two disciples, they merely interpret the text. For instance, if a position belongs to Yang, it is called Yang; if it belongs to Yin, it is called Yin. They do not understand that the signs involve the distinctions of wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness, and cold, and can these be simply categorized under the terms Yin and Yang? Furthermore, the texts state that to clarify the relationship between the superficial and the fundamental is to be fully aware of matters; failing to understand this relationship is called reckless action. </p>
<p>The discussion of superficial and fundamental spans from examining celestial phenomena above to investigating terrestrial geography below, and observing human affairs in between. The truth of this path is profound, while its principles are subtle; its applications are boundless, and its implementations must adhere to certain standards. Understanding this enables one to grasp the three principles of heaven, earth, and humankind.<a id="trans-680p" href="#orig-680p" class="marker">[680p]</a><br><strong>Medical Laws: Sayings on Qi and Fate</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the physical world has constants and variations. What governs fate are the constants; deviations from what governs are all changes. The constant is like the original Qi, while the changes can be everywhere, thus each has its domain. Therefore, there are variations in responses such as following, opposing, excessive, insufficient, and so forth, each governed by different laws. For example, when the Yin energy is in effect, there is much wind and the plants flourish; this is called following. When the weather is clear and dry without wind, this is called opposing. When the sky is cloudy and the water does not freeze, this is called excessive. When strong winds break trees and there is chaos among clouds, this is called stagnant. When mountains and marshes are scorched and plants wither, this is called excessive. When extreme heat causes pests and locusts to become a plague, this is called recovery. When landslide or earthquakes occur during a time of dust and fog, this is called excessive. And when it is ominously dark with heavy clouds during the day, this is called insufficient. </p>
<p>One must respond quickly to changes as they occur, observing the conditions of the time and place. Even a difference of a few miles can lead to different climates and thus different responses; how could one cling to a fixed rule? </p>
<p>In the yearly cycle, there are dominant Qi and guest Qi. The constant is the dominant, while the external arrivals are the guests.<a id="trans-681p" href="#orig-681p" class="marker">[681p]</a><br>The initial energy of the Jueyin and the final energy of the Taiyang represent the regular order of the four seasons, hence they are called master energies. However, the guest energies are not marked, which is why there are many interpretations. Some interpret the year of the Jiazi as starting at the first moment of water, the year of the Yichou as starting at the twenty-sixth moment, the year of the Bingyin at the fifty-first moment, and the year of the Dingmao at the seventy-sixth moment; these are referred to as guest energies. This is related to the four-part calendar system. How does the energy of great cold relate to the yearly cycle? Additionally, there is the fire from the south, supported by water, and the earth from below, supported by wind, which are also considered guest energies. These are still master energies and interact with the six terms, thus they cannot be purely guests. </p>
<p>Generally, what is referred to as guest occurs before the midpoint of the year, when heavenly governance is the master; after the midpoint, earthly governance is the master. The constant energies of the seasons act as the master, while the governance of heaven and earth acts as the guest. Disruption of the master energy leads to sudden harm, while disruption of the guest energy leads to gradual harm. Adjust the master and guest energies to avoid injury and disturbance; this is the method of managing energies. </p>
<p>In the operation of the lesser horn, when the wood of the year is insufficient, and it is insulted and overridden by metal, the metal does not seek virtue, thus it dominates by dryness over wind. At this time, there may be early white dew, the gathering of energies becomes prominent, transformation leads to a chilling disposition, and disasters manifest as sudden drops, named the lesser horn but practically similar to the year of Taishang. In the operation of the lesser tribute, when the fire of the year is insufficient, and it is insulted and overridden by water.<a id="trans-682p" href="#orig-682p" class="marker">[682p]</a><br>Water does not cultivate virtue, hence cold overcomes heat; there are times when cold mists gather ominously, and the ground is thick with ice. Its transformation brings sharpness, and its calamity is frost and hail, named the Lesser Proclamation, but in truth it shares the same fate as the Year of Great Feather. </p>
<p>In the operation of the Lesser Palace, the earth fails to keep up, and the one that dishonors and exploits it is wood. Wood does not cultivate virtue, thus wind overcomes moisture; there are times when great winds sweep forcefully, grasses bow and sand flies. Its transformation brings forth expansion, and its calamity is scattering, named the Lesser Palace, but in truth it aligns with the Year of Great Horn.</p>
<p>In the operation of the Lesser Commerce, the year of metal falls short, and the one that dishonors and exploits it is fire. Fire does not cultivate virtue, hence heat overcomes dryness; there are times when fire spreads, scorching and boiling. Its transformation is melting and its calamity is burning, named the Lesser Commerce, but in truth it is like the Year of Great Constellation.</p>
<p>In the operation of the Lesser Feather, the year of water is insufficient, and the one that dishonors and exploits it is earth. Earth does not cultivate virtue, therefore moisture overcomes cold; there are times when springs surge and rivers overflow, and fish inhabit drained marshes. Its transformation leads to sudden downpours, and its calamity is a deluge, named the Lesser Feather, but in truth it coincides with the Year of Great Palace. </p>
<p>Through understanding this, one can discern that the year is marked by drought and great floods, and thus it can be generalized. Between heaven and earth, if the vital energies are uneven and there is no means to rescue them, then the survival of all things becomes quite scarce.<a id="trans-683p" href="#orig-683p" class="marker">[683p]</a><br>Therefore, the five elements of wind, heat, dryness, dampness, and cold each govern a specific essence; the five processes of growth, transformation, collection, and storage each govern a specific season. By following the natural order, they can cyclically support one another; by opposing one another, they can cyclically rescue each other. Thus, it is said that the movement of the five essences is like a balance. The higher is suppressed, and the lower is uplifted. The transformative responds, and the conqueror is restored. The transformative responds, evenness of essences occurs; mutual benefit among the five essences arises. The conqueror&#39;s restoration indicates an imbalance of essences, leading to mutual harm among the five essences. When the essences are balanced and mutually beneficial, this is the way to maintain the norm; when the essences are unbalanced and harming one another, this is the way to observe change. Those of ancient times who understood this well and were adept at nurturing life, how could they not adjust to the fluctuations of fullness and emptiness according to the path to govern the spirit?</p>
<p>In the year ruled by the Sun, it is advisable to use bitterness and dryness, warming them. In the year ruled by Yangming, it is advisable to employ bitterness, spiciness to induce sweating, cleansing, dispersing, and also using salinity. In the year ruled by Shaoyang, it is advisable to use salinity; it is also suitable to use spiciness and sourness, to permeate, drain, soak, and stimulate, observing the cold and warmth in order to adjust its essence. In the year ruled by Taiyin, it is advisable to use bitterness and dryness, warming them; if severe, it is to stimulate and drain. If neither stimulating nor draining, the dampness overflows, leading to flesh decay and skin cracking, resulting in water and blood intermingling. In the year ruled by Shaoyin, it is advisable to use salinity to soften and adjust the upper body; if severe, use bitterness to stimulate and sourness to consolidate, thus calming the lower body; if extremely severe, use bitterness to purge. In the year ruled by Jueyin, it is advisable to use spiciness to adjust and sourness to moisten.<a id="trans-684p" href="#orig-684p" class="marker">[684p]</a><br>The year begins with Yang. In the first month (Yin), it signifies the initiation. The energy of Lesser Yang starts beneath the spring, pulling Yang upward into the realm above Heaven, Earth, and humanity. At this time, all grains and plants have begun to sprout. By the time of the Lesser Yin of summer, the fire blazes in the vast emptiness, leading to flourishing vegetation, hanging branches, and spreading leaves, which exemplifies the use of Yang and the essence of Yin. This illustrates how Heaven produces Yang to nourish Yin.</p>
<p>The text states that before the midpoint of the year, the weather is governed by the ascending and floating energy. When autumn arrives, the operation of Great Yin begins from Heaven and descends, bringing forth阴 (Yin) that penetrates the earth. Consequently, metal stirs into dryness, winds become fierce, and frost descends, leading to the demise of various entities, leaving only barren branches, similar to the fur of a beast. In winter, the energy of Lesser Yin again lies dormant beneath the springs, with ice splitting the ground, and all things densely packed—this shows the application of Yin and the essence of Yang. This illustrates how the earth uses Yang to subdue and hide Yin.</p>
<p>The text mentions that after the midpoint of the year, the earth’s energy governs the descent and consolidation. In the great discussions of the celestial origins, it is stated that the branches and stems of the year manage the six energies, which clearly deviate from the teachings of the ancient sages. The branches and stems of the year are uniform across the world and invariant across the four seasons. The warmth, heat, cold, and coolness of the weather, the illnesses of the populace, the variations in the four directions, and the differences in the hypotheses of spring, summer, autumn, and winter—how could they all be the same? Such fallacies are evident.<a id="trans-685p" href="#orig-685p" class="marker">[685p]</a><br>In recent times, the treatment for typhus is primarily based on the celestial stems and branches corresponding to the day of illness, which also derives from this principle. It must not be used indiscriminately. The energies of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth each govern a specific season—during their season, they are the dominant energy, presiding over the heavens; if their energy is present out of season, it is considered foreign energy; and if it is directly opposed to the season, it is termed as lying in the spring, meaning its energy is hidden beneath the yellow spring and thus not visible. </p>
<p>The treatment method involves using warmth for warmth and using cold for cold, as it is essential to acknowledge the seasonal energies and not disturb the harmony of the heavens. In spring, the wood energy presides, making all directions warm; in summer, the fire energy presides, making all directions hot; during the transition from summer to autumn, the earth energy presides, making all directions humid; in autumn, everything becomes cool; and in winter, everything becomes cold. The illnesses of the people often arise from this, which is an easily observable principle. Energies that oppose the season are termed foreign energies. Therefore, the treatment has concepts of using the opposing nature of energies. Observing this, the theory of circulating energies is indeed considerable.</p>
<p>For instance, the transformation of Taiyin rain is applied to the Yangming; the cold transformation of the Yangming is applied to the Shaoyin; the heat transformation of the Shaoyin is applied to the Yangming; the dryness transformation of the Yangming is applied to the Jueyin; and the windy transformation of the Jueyin is applied to the Taiyin. All excesses that prevail in us are our reality. Reality is true evil. Conversely, successes that prevail in others indicate our deficiency. Deficiency is false evil.<a id="trans-686p" href="#orig-686p" class="marker">[686p]</a><br>The distinction between the six vital energies refers to the concepts of existence and non-existence. However, although the movement of celestial bodies and vital energies can be categorized into five or six, the application of yin and yang boils down to water and fire alone. Therefore, when yang prevails, yin suffers, and when yin is dominant, yang suffers. One should drain the excess energy, addressing its presence, and nurture the depleted energy, addressing its absence. By seeking the fundamental source and probing its deeper meanings, resolving difficulties becomes as easy as picking up a stray hair.</p>
<p>If one does not understand the principles of order and disorder, fullness and emptiness, and instead firmly holds onto fixed ideas, it is like facing east yet not seeing the west wall, or facing south yet not perceiving the north. Observing a single curve does not allow for discussions on transformation, and focusing on one moment does not permit conversations about the larger picture, which inevitably leads to confusion and harm.</p>
<p>Among the six vital energies, three belong to yin: dampness, dryness, and cold. Two belong to yang: wind and heat. If fire lacks the transformative nature of the monarch, then yin overshadows yang, leading to death over life; thus, these two types of fire are essential. If one merely acknowledges the existence of two fires and concludes that yang is always excessive while focusing solely on its suppression, it disrupts the harmony of the heavens and undermines the foundation of life—nothing is worse than this. Such profound principles merit careful examination by scholars.</p>
<p>Wherever the three yang energies reside, there is an abundance of energy within those channels. Conversely, wherever the three yin energies are found, some channels may be unresponsive due to the deficiency in yang energy, indicating a lack of vitality.<a id="trans-687p" href="#orig-687p" class="marker">[687p]</a><br>In the arrangement of the three Yin, only the Lesser Yin stands alone in the center; this is the Yin among Yin. Therefore, the position of the Lesser Yin is one of non-response. In essence, it corresponds to the emptiness of heaven and earth; is it not said that the ruler oversees affairs? The principle of the five actions of overcoming and replenishing arises spontaneously. All things in heaven and earth inevitably reflect the five actions. If excess harms the regulation, how can it not take form? Thus, seeking within humanity, the five viscera balance each other, the five desires overcome each other, the five energies shift among themselves, and the five diseases transform into one another. Therefore, when fire is at its peak, cold arises; when cold is at its peak, dampness arises; when dampness is at its peak, wind arises; when wind is at its peak, dryness arises; and when dryness is at its peak, heat arises. This is all part of their transformation. The regulation in heaven and earth arises from the natural flow of energies, and it exists in humanity as well, where it pertains to the gains and losses of guidance and application. If one can understand its subtleties and grasp its principles, then control lies within oneself—what harm could there be? If the distinctions of prosperity and decline in regulation are unclear, and one cannot discern the true from the false, then chaos may indeed be anticipated. </p>
<p>Thus, when those of the Sun encounter flowing cycles, and those of the Moon meet with radiant epochs, the strong have regulation while the weak find support; the energies achieve their balance—what illness could there be? If the strong Yang encounters fire, then fierce heat arises; if cold Yin meets water, then frost and ice ensue. Heaven has its heavenly signs, the year has its yearly meetings; how can humanity obtain harmony without others?<a id="trans-688p" href="#orig-688p" class="marker">[688p]</a><br><strong>Explanation of the Laws in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of various diseases often stems from their root causes. The effects of the six qi can manifest either in the exterior or the interior. For instance, when there is cold water in the Taiyang, it is inherently cold while the exterior is hot; in the case of Shaoyin, the governing fire is intrinsically hot while the exterior is cold. Treatment may focus either on the root or the exterior, depending on the differentiation of cold and heat. </p>
<p>For the Shaoyang, the fire transforms into the root; for the Taiyin, the damp earth transforms into the root. Treatment should target the essence of the fire and dampness rather than the exterior signs of Shaoyang and Taiyin. In the Yangming, the dry metal transforms from dryness as the root; the Yangming represents the exterior. In the Jueyin, the wind wood transforms from wind as the root; the Jueyin represents the exterior. Treatment should not focus on the exterior signs but rather on the interior, which reflects the central qi. </p>
<p>Indeed, Yangming and Taiyin are interrelated, with their energies communicating internally; thus, treatment for dry metal is derived from the internal energy of damp earth. Likewise, Jueyin and Shaoyang are interrelated, actively interacting internally; therefore, treatment for wind wood is derived from the internal energy of corresponding fire. Furthermore, due to the incongruence between the exterior and the root energies in these two channels, treatment should be confirmed by the internal energies.<a id="trans-689p" href="#orig-689p" class="marker">[689p]</a><br>If we consider the interaction of the sun and the lesser yin as interdependent forces perceived in the environment, there are clearly distinct states of cold and heat that can be understood without seeking them internally. As for diseases, they all require treatment at their root. However, when it comes to issues of fullness and the difficulties of urine and feces, these are treated at the surface level. Fullness indicates a distended stomach; if the stomach is full, the energies of food and medicine cannot circulate, leading to a disruption in the organs and their functions. Thus, when unable to address the root, one must first treat the surface, as addressing the surface becomes fundamentally important.</p>
<p>When it comes to difficulties with urination and defecation, this signals an urgent condition. Among various diseases, there is none more pressing than this, so it must be treated first. Without addressing this, one cannot effectively manage other symptoms. </p>
<p>Additionally, the indicators of disease and their underlying causes differ. When a disease arises in excess, it inevitably affects other organs and energies; thus, one should treat the root first to prevent it from impacting other aspects. Conversely, when a disease arises from deficiency, it is likely to be burdened by other organs and energies, necessitating surface treatment first to avoid further complications to the primary organ or energy affected.</p>
<p>Just as in the case of diseases being the root and treatment methods being the surface, if practitioners do not assess the severity of the illness, and if the illness does not discriminate based on the efficacy of the treatment, then the relationship between root and surface becomes muddled. Hence, this summary aims to clarify these concepts.<a id="trans-690p" href="#orig-690p" class="marker">[690p]</a><br>The Principle of Treating Illness Without Considering the Annual Qi</p>
<p>In treating illness, if one does not understand the waxing and waning of annual qi, or the true and false vitality of the person&#39;s qi, then the responsibility lies with the physician for mismanaging the balance of the pathology and the healthy state. Not knowing how the year influences qi&#39;s intensity or decline, nor understanding the origins of true or false vitality, renders one unskilled in the art. Indeed, without awareness of the annual cycles, one cannot grasp the fluctuations of human vitality. </p>
<p>If one neglects the timing and reverses the conditions, without distinguishing between the five phases, internal pathologies arise, and the physician cannot guard against them. Treating illness without recognizing the presence or absence of qi, and failing to recognize the proper timing, leads to a muddling of the seasonal influences, with no clarity in understanding their fluctuations. If harmful pathogens arise internally and afflict the individual, despite the physician&#39;s efforts, they will be unable to prevent it due to ignorance of the timing and qi.</p>
<p>Not understanding the relationship between the four seasons and the five elements, nor how they interact and counteract one another, leads to misconceived treatments that attack the wrong conditions and undermine a person’s true vitality, ultimately risking their life unknowingly. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the annual qi; one should not disrupt the heavenly harmony.<a id="trans-691p" href="#orig-691p" class="marker">[691p]</a><br>There is no excess or deficiency; neglecting this can lead to calamity for people. Do not cause harm or lose what is proper, as this leads to the end of longevity for individuals. This is what the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; warns about in earnest; can learners not seek teachers to clarify? Indeed, the year has six seasonal energies that govern, with the southern and northern influences. Knowing these six energies, one can correspond to the pulse in dimension. In the case of the Taiyin, the pulse is deep; for Shaoyin, it is hooked; for Jueyin, it is taut; for Taiyang, it is large and long; for Yangming, it is short and slippery; for Shaoyang, it is large and superficial. This reveals that the six pulses reflect the harmony of heaven. Those who do not understand call them disease pulses, attacking cold to incite heat, but the pulse remains unchanged while heat sickness arises. Controlling heat to induce cold keeps the pulse the same, yet cold sickness occurs again. How can one seek harmony under such circumstances? The origins of untimely deaths often stem from this. Ignoring true conditions and merely attacking, whether in cases of excess or deficiency, invites harm and loses the proper balance, resulting in calamity and the cessation of longevity for individuals.<a id="trans-692p" href="#orig-692p" class="marker">[692p]</a><br>Recipe</p>

<p>　　　　黄帝素问</p>
<p>　　　　　五运行大论</p>
<p>　　黄帝坐明堂，始正天纲，临观八极，考建五常。　　【注　天纲，天之度数也。八极，地之八方也。五常，五行政令之常也。】　　请天师而问之曰：论言天地之动静，神明为之纪。阴阳之升降，寒暑彰其兆。　　 【注　神明者，日月斗星也。纪者，以日月纪度星斗定位也。寒暑者，阴阳之征兆也。】　　余闻五运之数于夫子，夫子之所言，正五气之各主岁尔。首甲定运，余因论之。鬼臾区曰：土主甲己，金主乙庚，水主丙辛，木主丁壬，火主戊癸。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>子午之上，少阴主之；丑未之上，太阴主之；寅申之上，少阳主之；卯酉之上，阳明主之；辰戌之上，太阳主之；巳亥之上，厥阴主之。不合阴阳，其故何也？　　 【注　余闻五运之数于夫子者，言五运之气，已论于六节脏象论中矣，余因论之。鬼臾区复以五运六气相合主岁而论者，即天元纪大论也。不合阴阳者，五运六气之阴阳不相合也。】　　岐伯曰：是明道也。此天地之阴阳也。夫数之可数者，人中之阴阳也。然所合数之可得者也。夫阴阳者，数之可十，推之可百，数之可千，推之可万。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>天地阴阳者，不可以数推，以象之谓也。　　 【注　伯言臾区所论五运六气相合而主治者，是明天地阴阳之道也。夫数之可数者，人中之阴阳也。所谓人中之阴阳者，其生五，其气三。三而成天，三而成地，三而成人。三而三之，合则为九。九分为九野，九野为九脏，以应天六六之节，此人中之阴阳与天地相合，其所合之数，可得而数者也。若夫天地之阴阳者，数之可十、可百，推之可千、可万，难以数推，止可以象。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>推之象者，即下文之丹、黅、苍、素、元之天象，南面、北面之图象是也。】　　帝曰：愿闻其所始也。岐伯曰：昭乎哉问也！臣览《太始天元册》文：丹天之气，经于牛、女、戊分；黅天之气，经于心、尾、己分；苍天之气，经于危、室、柳、鬼；素天之气，经于亢、氐、昴、毕；元天之气，经于张、冀、娄、胃。所谓戊己分者，奎、璧、角、轸，则天地之门户也。夫候之所始，道之所生，不可不通也。　　【注　此言五行之化，运始于五方之天象也。丹，赤色，火之气也。牛、女在癸度，经于牛、女戊分，戊癸合而化火也。黅，黄色，土之气也。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>心、尾在甲度，经于心、尾，己分，甲己合而化土也。苍，青色，木之气也。危、室在壬度，柳、鬼在丁度，丁壬合而化木也。素，白色，金之气也。亢、氐在乙度，昴、毕在庚度，乙庚合而化金也。元，黑色，水之气也。张、冀在丙度，娄、胃在辛度，丙辛合而化水也。戊己居中宫，为天地之门户。《遁甲经》曰：六戊为天门，六己为地户，在奎、璧、角、轸之分。奎、璧在干方，角、轸在巽方，此五气化为五行之始，乃天地阴阳道之所生，不可不通也。】　　帝曰：善。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>论言天地者，万物之上下，左右者，阴阳之道路。未知其所谓也。　　 【注　此复论六气之上下左右也。司天在上、在泉、在下，万物化生于其间，故天地为万物之上下。左右者间气也，间气者纪步，故为阴阳之道路。】　　岐伯曰：所谓上下者，岁上下见，阴阳之所在也。　　 【注　此言司天在泉之上下也。如子午岁，少阴在上，则阳明在下；丑未岁，太阴在上，则太阳在下；寅申岁，少阳在上，则厥阴在下；卯酉岁，阳明在上，则少阴在下；辰戌岁，太阳在上，则太阴在下；巳亥岁，厥阴在上，则少阳在下矣。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p"

【注　此言在上之左右也。在东为左，在西为右。凡见厥阴在上，则少阴在左，太阳在右；见少阴在上，则太阴在左，厥阴在右；见太阴在上，则少阳在左，少阴在右；见少阳在上，则阳明在左，太阴在右；见阳明在上，则太阳在左，少阳在右；见太阳在上，则厥阴在左，阳明在右。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>盖以图象向南，人面北以观之，言其所见之图象，而命其上下左右之定位也。】　　帝曰：何谓下？岐伯曰：厥阴在上，则少阳在下，左阳明，右太阴；少阴在上，则阳明在下，左太阳，右少阳；太阴在上，则太阳在下，左厥阴，右阳明；少阳在上，则厥阴在下，左少阴，右太阳；阳明在上，则少阴在下，左太阴，右厥阴；太阳在上，则太阴在下，左少阳，右少阴。所谓面南而命其位，言其见也。　　【注　此言在下之左右也。如巳亥岁，厥阴在上，则少阳在下矣，而阳明在少阳之左，太阴在少阳之右。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>如子午岁，少阴在上，则阳明在下矣，而太阳在阳明之左，少阳在阳明之右。如丑未岁，太阴在上，则太阳在下矣，而厥阴在太阳之左，阳明在太阳之右。如寅申岁，少阳在上，则厥阴在下矣，而少阴在厥阴之左，太阳在厥阴之右。如卯酉岁，阳明在上，则少阴在下矣，而太阴在少阴之左，厥阴在少阴之右。如辰戌岁，太阳在上，则太阴在下矣，而少阳在太阴之左，少阴在太阴之右。盖以图象向北，人面南以观之。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>以所见之上下左右，而命其位，故曰言其见也。】　　上下相遘，寒暑相临。气相得则和，不相得则病。　　 【注　相临者，谓加临之六气也。言司天在泉之气，则上下相遇，左右间气之气，则四时加临。如太阳寒水之气，加临于上半岁，则少阴少阳暑热之气，加临于下半岁矣。如暑热之气，加临于上半岁，则寒水之气，加临于下半岁矣。举寒暑而六气自序，盖以上下主岁，上下左右六气纪时。如与时相得则和，与时相逆则病矣。】　　帝曰：气相得而病者何也？岐伯曰：以下临上，不当位也。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　 【注　此言加临之六气，与主时之六气，有相得而不相得也。气相得者，如少阴君火之气，与少阳相火之气相合，君臣之相得也。君位在上，臣位在下，如君火加临于相火之上为顺，相火加临于君火之上是为下临上，不当其位也。六微旨论曰：君位臣则顺，臣位君则逆。逆则其病近，其害速；顺则其病远，其害微。所谓二火也。】　　帝曰：动静何如？岐伯曰：上者右行，下者左行。左右周天，余而复会也。　　 【注　动静者，天地之道也。在上者司天，在下者纪地。<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>如子年少阴在上，则阳明在下矣。周天之三百六十五日，则在上者，右行于太阴；在下者，左行于太阳也。上下左右周司天之六岁，尚余午、未、申、酉、戌、亥之六岁，又还转而复会也。】　　帝曰：余闻鬼臾区曰：应地者静。今夫子乃言下者左行，不知其所谓也。愿闻何以生之乎？　　 【注　静者，地之体也。生谓动之所生。】　　岐伯曰：天地动静，五行迁复，虽鬼臾区其上候而已，犹不能遍明。　　 【注　天地动静，谓司天在泉之气，繞地而环转也。五行迁复，谓五运相袭，周而复始也。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>其上谓臾区其上至于十世，止能占候其天之动象，地之静形，犹不能遍明天地阴阳之运行也。】　　夫变化之用，天垂象，地成形，七曜纬虚，五行丽地。地者，所以载生成之形类也。虚者，所以列应天之精气也。形精之动，犹根本之与枝叶也。仰观其象，虽远可知也。　　【注　变化之用者，谓天地阴阳之运动也。在天无形而垂象，在地有形而成形。七曜，日月五星也。纬虚者，经纬于太虚之间，亦繞地而环转也。五行，五方五气之所生而成形者。地者，所以载生成之物类也。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>精者，天一所生之精水也。应天之精气者，在天为气，在下为水。水应天而天连水也。形谓地之体，静而不动者也。形精之动者，谓地下在泉之气旋转，犹根本不动而枝叶动摇，然根气又与枝叶之相通也。仰观其天象，见日月五星之繞地右旋，道虽深远，可得而知矣。】　　帝曰：地之为下否乎？岐伯曰：地为人之下，太虚之中者也。帝曰：冯乎？岐伯曰：大气举之也。　　 【注　地之为下者，谓天居上而地居下也。太虚者，虚无之气也，言地居太虚之中，大气举之，无所冯依者也。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>按《浑天说》曰：天之形状似鸟卵，地居其中，天包地外，犹卵之裹黄，圆如弹丸，故曰浑天。言其形体浑浑然也，其术以为天半覆地上，半在地下。其天居地上见者，一百八十二度半强，地下亦然。北极出地上三十六度，南极入地下亦三十六度，而嵩高正当天之中极也。】　　燥以干之，暑以蒸之，风以动之，湿以润之，寒以坚之，火以温之。故风寒在下，燥热在上，湿气在中，火游行其间，寒暑六入，故令虚而生化也。　　 【注　风、寒、暑、湿、燥、火，在天无形之气也。干、蒸、动、润、坚、温，在地有形之征也。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>天包乎地，是以在天之上，在泉之下，在地之中，八极之外，六合之内，无所不至。盖言太虚之气，不惟包乎地之外，而通贯乎地之中也。寒水在下，而风从地水中生，故风寒在下。燥乃干金之气，热乃太阳之火，故燥热在上。土位中央，故湿气在中。火乃太极中之元阳，即天之阳气，故游行于上下之间。《易》曰：日月运行，一寒一暑。寒暑往来，而六者之气，皆入于地中，故令有形之地，受无形之虚气，而生化万物也。】　　故燥胜则地干，暑胜则地热，风胜则地动，湿胜则地泥，寒胜则地裂，火胜则地固矣。　　 【注　此复结上文六入之义。】<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>　　帝曰：天地之气，何以候之？岐伯曰：天地之气，胜复之作，不形于诊也。脉法曰：天地之变，无以脉诊。此之谓也。　　【注　天地之气者，五运六气也。胜复之作者，淫胜郁复也。言气运之变，而为民病者，非诊候之可知也。盖每岁有司天之六气，有主岁之五运，有间气之加临，有四时之主气。人在天地气交之中，一气不和，即为民病。是天地四时之气，而为民病，其不能以脉诊，而别某气之不和也。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>再按平脉篇曰：伏气之病，以意候之。今月之内，欲有伏气，假令旧有伏气，当须脉之。盖天地之气，淫胜则所不胜之气郁伏矣，民感之而为病者，亦郁伏于内，而不形于诊也。故欲知伏气之病，当以意候之，候今月之内，有何气之不和，则知民有伏气之病矣。郁伏之气复发，而民病始作，然后发见于脉。故曰：假令旧有伏气，当须脉之。此与暴感风寒暑湿之邪，而卒病伤寒，中风即见于脉诊者之不同。故曰：天地之气，无以脉诊。此之谓也。】　　帝曰：间气如何？<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>　　 【注　间气者，加临之六气也。以上之左右，下之左右，兼于其间共为六气，故曰间气。每一气加临于四时之中，各主六十日，故曰间气者纪步。盖以六十日零八十七刻半为一步也。】　　岐伯曰：随气所在，期于左右。<br>　　【注　六微旨论曰：天枢之上，天气主之。天枢之下，地气主之。又曰：加者地气也。中者天气也。盖以在下之气左转，在上之气右旋，各主六十日以终一岁。故曰，随气所在，期于左右。谓随在上在下之气之所在，而期于左右之旋转也。如子年少阴在上，则阳明在下矣。少阴在上，则厥阴在左，太阴在右。阳明在下，则太阳在左，少阳在右。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>盖以地之左转而主初气，故以太阳主正月朔日之，寅初一刻为始，次厥阴，次少阴以司天之气，终三气，而主岁半以上。次太阴，次少阳，次阳明以在泉之气，终六气，而主岁半以下。各加临六十日，以终一岁也。六气环转相同。】　　帝曰：期之奈何？岐伯曰：从其气则和，违其气则病。　　 【注　间气者，加临之客气也。而一岁之中，又有主时之六气。如主从其客则和，违其客则病矣。如子午岁，初之气，系太阳寒水加临，主气系厥阴风木。如寒胜其风为从，风胜其寒为逆。故下经曰：主胜逆，客胜从。六气皆然。】　　不当其位者病。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>　　 【注　不当其位者，即上文之所谓以下临上也。】　　迭移其位者病。<br>　　 【注　如初之气，太阳寒水加临而反热。三之气，少阴君火加临而反寒。本位之气互相更迭，气之反也，故为民病。六气皆然。】　　失守其位者危。<br>　　 【注　失守其位，谓失守其所主之本位。如丑未岁，太阴司天，则初之客气、主气并主厥阴风木，而清肃之气乘所不胜而侮之，是金失守其位矣。至五之气，阳明燥金主气，而本位反虚。风木之子气复雠，火热烁金，则为病甚危，所谓侮反受邪也。】　　尺寸反者死。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>　　 【注　南政北政之岁，有寸不应、尺不应之分。如应不应，而反应之，是为尺寸相反。】　　阴阳交者死。<br>　　 【注　南政北政之岁，有左右尺寸之不应。盖左为阳，右为阴；寸为阳，尺为阴。如阴阳交相应者死。】　　先立其年，以知其气，左右应见，然后乃可以言死生之逆顺。　　 【注　此总结六气之加临。先立其主气之年，以知其司天在泉之气，则间气之应见于左右，或从或违，然后乃可以言死生之逆顺。】　　帝曰：寒暑燥湿风火，在人合之奈何？其于万物何以化生？　　 【注　此论天地之气，而合于人民万物。】　　岐伯曰：东方生风，风生木，木生酸，酸生肝，肝生筋，筋生心。　　【注　五方生天之五气，五气生地之五行，五行生五味而生五脏，五脏生外合之五体。<a id="orig-22p"

【注　此言阴阳不测之变化，运行于天、地、人之间。为元，为道，为化，为有形之五行、五体、五脏，皆神用无方之妙用也。柔者风木之气柔软也。】　　其性为暄，其德为和，其用为动，其色为苍，其化为荣。其虫毛。其政为散，其令宣发，其变摧拉，其眚为陨，其味为酸，其志为怒。怒伤肝，悲胜怒。风伤肝，燥胜风。酸伤筋，辛胜酸。　　【注　性者，五行之性也。德化者，气之祥也。政令者，气之章也。变眚者，气之易也。<a

<p>　　五运六气之说，不见于儒者之六经，而见于医家之《素问》。夫《素问》乃先秦古书，虽未必皆黄帝岐伯之言，然秦火已前，春秋战国之际，有如和缓、秦越人辈，虽甚精于医，其察天地五行之用，未能若是精密也。则其言虽不尽出于黄帝岐伯，其旨亦必有所从授矣。且夫寒暑湿燥风火者，天之阴阳，三阴三阳上奉之；木火土金水者，地之阴阳，生长化收藏下应之。而五运行于其间，则五之化气也。天数终于五，六居之；地数终于六，七居之。戊己土也，化气必以五，故甲己化土而居其首；土生金，故乙庚次之；金生水，故丙辛次之；水生木，故丁壬次之；木生火，故戊癸次之。此化气之序也。地之三阴三阳亦五行耳，而火独有二，五行之妙理也。盖木旺于东，火旺于南，金旺于西，水旺于北，而土旺于四维。<a id="orig-581p" href="#trans-581p" class="marker">[581p]</a><br>戊附于戌而在干，己附于辰而在巽，而未之对冲在丑，故辰戌丑未寄旺之位也。未在西南，其卦为坤，其时为长夏。以其处四时之中，《吕氏月令》谓之中央。假如太角壬木之化为启坼，而变为摧拉，太征戊火之化为暄燠，而变为炎烈，正化之为变者然也。少角丁木，木气不足，清胜而热复，少征癸火，火气不足，寒胜而雨复，邪化之为复者然也。寒甚而为阳焰，是为火，郁热甚而为凄清，是为金，郁抑而不伸者然也。水郁而发，则为冰雹，土郁而发，则为飘骤，郁而怒起者然也。风淫所胜则克太阴，热淫所胜则克阳明，凌其所胜者然也。相火之下，水气承之，湿土之下，风气承之，极则有反者然也。摧拉之变不应，普天悉皆大风；炎烈之变不应，薄海悉皆燔灼；清气之胜不应，宇宙无不明洁；雨气之复不应，山泽无不蒸溽。<a id="orig-582p" href="#trans-582p" class="marker">[582p]</a><br>郁也，发也，淫也，承也，其理皆然。凡此者，其应非有候，则有不时而应者矣。其至非有时，则有卒然而至者矣。是故千里之远，其变相似者有之；百里之近，其变不同者亦有之。即其时当其处，随其变而占焉，则吉凶可知。况《素问》所以论天地之气化者，将以观其变而救民之疾也。夫大而天地，小而人之一身，五行之气皆在焉。天地之气，有常无变，则人亦和平而无灾。天地之气变而失常，则疾疠之所从出也。是故木气胜则肝以实病，脾以虚病；火气胜则心以实病，肺以虚病。此医者所能致察，儒者不得其详也。至于官天地，理阴阳，顺五行，使冬无愆阳，夏无伏阴，秋无苦雨，春无凄风，和平之气行于两间，国无水旱之灾，民无妖孽之疾，此儒者所当察，医者未必能知也。《素问》亦略言之矣。<a id="orig-583p" href="#trans-583p" class="marker">[583p]</a><br>五行之精，是为五纬，与运气相应。有岁星，有辰星，以此察其行之逆顺，而占其吉凶，然必曰德者福之，过者罪之，则是运气之和平而为休祥，有德者召之也，运气之乖戾而为疾眚，有过者致之也。虽然，其说略而未详，吾儒之经则详矣。《洪范》九畴始于五行，中于皇极，终于五福六极，圣人建极于上，以顺五行之用，是以天下之民有五福而无六极，有五福皆可以康宁矣，无六极皆免于疾病矣。此其道固有行乎运气之外者，是以大舜成周之时尝见之。由庚之诗作而阴阳得由其道，华黍之诗作而四序不失其和，由仪之诗作而万物各得其宜，此建皇极，顺五行，使民有五福而无六极之验矣。是故《素问》则方伎之书，《洪范》则圣人经世之大法也。知有《素问》不知有《洪范》，方伎之流也。知有《洪范》不知有《素问》，亦未许为通儒。　　二十四气之图<a id="orig-584p" href="#trans-584p" class="marker">[584p]</a><br>　　见图<br>　　【五日谓之候，三候成一气。大小闰月，但依历交之。凡四时寒暑温凉，盛于季月。然差正位三十日有奇也。】<br>　　　　　论四时气候</p>

<p>　　百病之起，多生于本。六气之用，则有生于标者，有生于中气者。太阳寒水，本寒标热；少阴君火，本热标寒。其治或从本，或从标，审寒热而异施也。少阳相火，从火化为本；太阴湿土，从湿化为本。其治但从火湿之本，不从少阳太阴之标也。阳明燥金，金从燥化，燥为本；阳明为标，厥阴风木，木从风化，风为本；厥阴为标，其治不从标本而从乎中，中者，中见之气也。盖阳明与太阴为表里，其气互通于中，是以燥金从湿土之中气为治；厥阴与少阳为表里，其气互通于中，是以风木从相火之中气为治。亦以二经标本之气不合，故从中见之气以定治耳。<a id="orig-689p" href="#trans-689p" class="marker">[689p]</a><br>若夫太阳少阴亦互为中见之气者，然其或寒或热，标本甚明，可以不求之于中耳。至于诸病，皆治其本，惟中满与大小二便不利，治其标。盖中满则胃满，胃满则药食之气不能行，而脏腑皆失所禀，故无暇治其本，先治其标，更为本之本也。二便不通，乃危急之候，诸病之急，无急于此，故亦先治之，舍此则无有治标者矣。至于病气之标本，又自不同，病发而有余，必累及他脏他气，先治其本，不使得入他脏他气为善，病发而不足，必受他脏他气之累，先治其标，不使累及本脏本气为善。又如病为本，工为标，工不量病之浅深，病不择工之臧否，亦是标本不得也。缘标本之说，错出难明，故此述其大略云。<a id="orig-690p" href="#trans-690p" class="marker">[690p]</a><br>　　　　　一申治病不先岁气之律</p>

<p><strong>The Great Discussion on the Five Movements</strong></p>
<p>Huangdi sat in the Ming Hall, beginning to establish the celestial principles, observing the eight directions, and considering the establishment of the five constants. He asked the heavenly teacher: &quot;Speaking of the movements and stillness of Heaven and Earth, the wise spirits are the recorders of these. The ascent and descent of Yin and Yang, cold and heat reveal their signs.&quot; I have heard about the numbers of the five movements from my teacher, who spoke of how each of the five energies governs the respective years. The first cycle establishes the movements: Earth governs the first and sixth, Metal governs the second and seventh, Water governs the third and eighth, Wood governs the fourth and ninth, and Fire governs the fifth and tenth.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

The disharmony of Yin and Yang arises when the Yin-Yang of the Five Movements and Six Qis do not align.)</p>
<p>Qibo said: This is the clarified way. This is the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth. As for the quantifiable numbers, they represent the Yin and Yang within humans.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The yin and yang of heaven and earth cannot be quantified; they are understood through symbols. The discussion in the text refers to the five movements and six atmospheres that interact and govern, illustrating the principles of yin and yang in the universe. The quantifiable yin and yang are those within humans. This human yin and yang give rise to the five elements and three vital energies. Three relates to heaven, three relates to earth, and three relates to humanity. When threes combine, they form nine. Nine divides into nine regions, which correspond to the nine organs, aligning with the six divisions of heaven. This represents the harmony between human yin and yang and the cosmos, where the quantities can indeed be counted. However, the yin and yang of heaven and earth are vast—countable in tens and hundreds, and extrapolated into the thousands and tens of thousands—making them beyond mere quantification, understood only through symbolic representation.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

I have reviewed the text of the &#39;Records of the Original Celestial Elements&#39;: The red celestial energy travels through the Ox, the Maiden, and the Wu division; the black celestial energy travels through the Heart, the Tail, and the Ji division; the blue celestial energy travels through the Danger, the Room, the Willow, and the Ghost; the white celestial energy travels through the Ascendant, the Earth, the Spirits, and the End; the original celestial energy travels through the Zhang, the Ji, the Lou, and the Stomach. The so-called Wu and Ji division refers to the Well, the Jade, the Horn, and the Chariot, which are the gates of Heaven and Earth. The origin of these signs and the generation of the Way must not be overlooked. This discusses the transformation of the five elements, which begins from the celestial signs of the five directions. Red represents fire energy. The Ox and the Maiden are at the point of Gui, traveling through the Ox and Maiden Wu division; the combination of Wu and Gui transforms into fire.

<p>When the upper and lower elements encounter each other, and the cold and heat come together, the energy harmonizes if they are compatible, but if they are not, illness arises. </p>
<p>The reference to &quot;coming together&quot; refers to the six atmospheric energies. It indicates that when the energies from the heavens meet with those of the springs, the upper and lower energies encounter each other, and the energies between left and right also interact, then the four seasons come together. For example, when the energy of the sun and the cold water interacts in the first half of the year, the energies of lesser yin and lesser yang related to warmth and heat also come forth in the second half of the year. Conversely, if the energy of warmth prevails in the first half of the year, then the cold water energy emerges in the second half. </p>
<p>By considering the elements of cold and heat, the six energies are sequenced, primarily focusing on the upper and lower elements of the year, while the six energies on the left and right mark the passage of time. When they align with the season, harmony occurs; when they are opposed, illness arises. </p>

When the qi are in harmony, it is like the qi of the Lesser Yin&#39;s fire associating with the qi of the Lesser Yang&#39;s fire, representing the relationship between sovereign and minister. The sovereign&#39;s position is above, while the minister&#39;s position is below; when the sovereign fire influences the minister fire above it, this is in accordance with the order. Conversely, when the minister fire influences the sovereign fire above it, this is an improper inversion of their positions.

This refers to the vastness of the void, which not only encompasses the outside of the earth but also penetrates through its depths. Cold water lies below, while wind arises from the interaction of earth and water, thus cold winds reside beneath. Dryness corresponds to the energy of the dry metal, while heat corresponds to the fire of the sun, hence dry heat is above. Soil occupies the center, so moisture resides within. Fire is the primal Yang of the supreme ultimate, that is, the vital energy of heaven, thus it moves between above and below. The Book of Changes states: &quot;The sun and moon move in cycles, one cold and one hot.&quot; As cold and heat alternate, the energies of the six elements all enter the earth, allowing the tangible earth to receive the intangible void energy, and thus engender all things. Therefore, when dryness prevails, the land becomes dry; when heat prevails, the land becomes hot; when wind prevails, the land moves; when moisture prevails, the land turns muddy; when cold prevails, the land cracks; when fire prevails, the land solidifies. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: &quot;Regarding diseases caused by hidden pathogens, they are assessed through intention. If there is a hidden pathogen within the month, assuming there was already a latent condition, pulse examination must be conducted. The energies of heaven and earth, when excessive, will suppress opposing energies, leading to latent conditions. The people affected will experience illness from this suppressed state, which does not manifest during diagnosis. Therefore, to understand diseases caused by hidden pathogens, one must intuitively assess them, observing any disharmonies of energy within the month, thus recognizing the presence of latent illness among the people. When the suppressed energy flares up and illness begins, it will then become recognizable in the pulse. Hence, it is stated: if there was already a hidden pathogen, pulse examination must be conducted. This is different from sudden issues caused by external forces like wind, cold, heat, or dampness, which can immediately show up during pulse diagnosis. Therefore, it is said: the energies of heaven and earth cannot be diagnosed through pulse examination. It is with this understanding.&quot; The emperor then asked: &quot;What about intermittent energy?&quot;<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

It is based on the understanding that sixty days plus eighty-seven and a half ke constitutes a single step.</p>

The qi below turns left, while the qi above rotates right, each governing sixty days to complete a year. Thus, it is said to observe the position of qi and consider the left and right rotations.

Next is Jueyin, followed by Shaoyin, in charge of the heavenly qi, completing the three qi and overseeing the year above half. Following that is Taiyin, then Shaoyang, and finally Yangming, which governs the qi of the springs, completing the six qi and overseeing the year below half. Each is supplemented by an additional sixty days to finalize a year. The six qi circulate in the same manner.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How is the period determined? Qibo replied: Following its qi brings harmony; opposing it leads to disease.</p>
<p>Note: The interstitial qi is the guest qi that accompanies the main. During a year, there are also the six qi that govern the times. If the main follows its guests, harmony prevails; if it goes against them, illness arises. For instance, in the Year of the Rat and Horse, the initial qi, associated with the cold water of the sun, governs the qi related to Jueyin, which is connected to wind and wood. If cold dominates wind, it aligns; if wind overcomes cold, it is contrary. Hence, it is stated in the lower scriptures: the main overcomes the contrary, and the guest overcomes the aligned.

In the case of the fifth energy, the dryness of the Yangming Metal leads to a deficiency in its original position.

The insult arises because the wood energy is insufficient, yet the metal energy can restrain the wood, making it less fearful. This passage discusses the energies of the five movements, focusing on the year and the time, while also addressing the dynamics of the six energies in relation to one another. The union of the five and six is what forms the year.]</p>
<p>The energies of the five movements and six energies govern the year&#39;s cycles, addressing both excess and insufficiency and the influences of interstitial energies. </p>
<p>[Note: The sections on years and movements are summarized through this diagram; the five movements, six energies, heavenly officials, interstitial energies, and the governing of time and years are all encompassed here. By correlating weather, public health, and various conditions, everything becomes clear without needing excessive elaboration.]<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Great Discussion of the Six Subtleties</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Alas! So distant. The Way of Heaven is like welcoming floating clouds, like gazing into a deep abyss. The deep abyss can still be measured, but welcoming floating clouds knows no limits. </p>
<p>[Note: The Way of Heaven refers to the way of yin and yang. It speaks of the way of yin and yang, which is high and deep. That which has form can still be measured, but what exists in Heaven as qi is beyond knowing its limits.]</p>
<p>The Master often spoke of diligently upholding the Way of Heaven. I have heard and cherished it, in my heart I have my doubts, and do not understand its meaning. I wish the Master could expand on this, fully explaining the matter so it never fades away and endures through time. Can the Way of Heaven be made known? </p>
<p>Qibo bowed deeply and replied: Your inquiry is indeed profound, the Way of Heaven is such. This is due to the order of Heaven, the times of prosperity and decline. </p>
<p>[Note: The Way of Heaven refers to the yin and yang of Heaven. The order of Heaven is based on six as the measure, revolving around the six types of qi.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear of the Way of Heaven, the six-fold measure, and the reasons for prosperity and decline? Qibo replied: There are positions above and below, rules to the left and right. Therefore, to the right of Shaoyang is Yangming; to the right of Yangming is Taiyang; to the right of Taiyang is Jueyin; to the right of Jueyin is Shaoyin; to the right of Shaoyin is Taiyin; to the right of Taiyin is Shaoyang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, it is said: according to the order of heaven, during times of flourishing and decline, one should adjust the light and position properly, standing upright and waiting for it. This is what it means.</p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;six six&quot; refers to the three yin and three yang that govern the heavens, corresponding to the six vital energies in heaven. When there are positions above and below, it is stated that if the lesser yin is above, then the bright yang is below; if the greater yin is above, then the sun is below; if the lesser yang is above, then the decisive yin is below; if the decisive yin is above, then the lesser yin is below; if the sun is above, then the greater yin is below; if the decisive yin is above, then the lesser yang is below. The six phases rotate, each with their defined positions above and below. As for the left and right, for instance, if the lesser yin is above, then the decisive yin is on the left, and the greater yin is on the right; if the greater yin is above, then the lesser yin is on the left, and the lesser yang is on the right; if the lesser yang is above, then the sun is on the left, and the bright yang is on the right; if the bright yang is above, then the lesser yang is on the left, and the sun is on the right; if the sun is above, then the bright yang is on the left, and the decisive yin is on the right; if the decisive yin is above, then the sun is on the left, and the lesser yin is on the right. Each follows the presence of qi above, establishing a left and right distinction. Thus, the right side of the lesser yang is governed by the bright yang; the right side of the bright yang is governed by the sun. This is due to the placement of yin and yang on the right side, transitioning above and presiding over the years. The marker of qi is evident above. The celestial qi rotates clockwise, thus facing south and awaiting its orderly rotation. Moving light refers to the running of the sun and moon, determining the position of vital energy by the sun completing a full cycle around the heavens. Standing upright means standing facing south.] </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The passage discusses the six energies of the Three Yin and Three Yang, which, although responding to one another, differ individually. Shaoyin represents Yin but is inherently warm, while Taiyang represents Yang but is inherently cold; this distinction pertains to their fundamental attributes. Shaoyin and Taiyang follow their inherent nature and representation. Taiyin and Shaoyang stem from their fundamentals. Yangming and Jueyin do not follow the representation or fundamentals but arise from the middle. Thus, there are those that are derived from fundamentals, those that are derived from representations, those that derive from both representations and fundamentals, and those that are derived from observations of the middle. This illustrates the varying manifestations of the energies.</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired: &quot;What accounts for some energies being present while others are absent, some being excessively present?&quot; Qibo responded: &quot;Those that are present and complete represent harmony; those that are present but not complete indicate that the incoming energy does not reach sufficiently; those that are incomplete yet reach signify an excess of the incoming energy.&quot;</p>
<p>This discourse addresses the main energies of the Three Yin and Three Yang throughout the year, and the occurrences of excess or deficiency. When energies are present and complete, it signifies a year of balanced energies, with no excess or deficiency, where the seasonal energies arrive timely, reflecting harmony in energies. For example, if spring is supposed to be warm yet remains cold, or if summer is expected to be hot yet remains warm, this indicates presence without completeness, due to inadequate incoming energy. Conversely, if warmth arrives before spring or heat before summer, this signifies an arrival of energy that is premature and excessive, indicating an abundance of incoming energy.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

In years of deficiency, the heavenly qi arrives at the later heaven; in years of surplus, the heavenly qi arrives at the earlier heaven.

All these living things respond to the heavenly phenomena. The response of qi and channels indicates that when the Tai Yang governs the heavens, cold descends into the vast void, and yang qi is not permitted; when the Yang Ming governs the heavens, yang rules its command, and summer heat prevails; when the Tai Yin governs the heavens, yin rules its authority, and yang qi retreats.]<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the water rises without soil to contain it, then the water overflows and extinguishes the fire; without soil to regulate the water, the water rises even more. Thus, excess leads to harm among the five elements, causing chaos in the processes of growth and transformation, resulting in significant afflictions. The external manifestations of prosperity and decline refer to the energy of the year, which can have both abundance and scarcity. If the energy of the year and the energy of the time both become excessively strong, the harm becomes even greater. Therefore, it is said that harm leads to chaos and significant afflictions.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What are prosperity and decline? Qibo replied: When it is out of place, it is evil; when it is in place, it is correct. When evil prevails, changes are extreme; when correct, changes are subtle.</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the years of excess and deficiency in energy. When it is out of place, it means that the energy is excessive and subdues what it should conquer while taking offense against what it can’t conquer – this is the prosperity of the year. When the energy is insufficient, it means that what it can&#39;t conquer is offensive, and what it should conquer is slighted – this is the decline of the year. In both cases, they fail to maintain their proper positions, and thus there arises internal evil. When it is in place, it is a year of balanced energy, with no excessive or insufficient oppression, and each maintains its proper position; this is the correct energy. When there is evil, changes are extreme; when there is correctness, changes are subtle.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What is meant by being in place? Qibo replied: Wood operates in the East, fire operates in the South, earth operates across the four seasons, metal operates in the West, and water operates in the North. This is what is meant by the meeting of the year; it signifies balanced energy.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: When the Heavenly Sign coincides with the annual meeting, it is called Great Yiy. The Heavenly Sign corresponds to the years of Wu Wu, Ji Chou, Ji Wei, and Yi You, representing the merger of the Qi of the heavens, the Qi of the Five Movements, and the annual Qi, hence it is also referred to as the Three Mergers.)</p>
<p>The Emperor then asked, &quot;What about its nobility and baseness?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;The Heavenly Sign represents the enforcement of law, the annual meeting signifies the implementation of commands, and the Great Yiy Heavenly Sign represents nobility.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Wang Bing states that &quot;enforcement of law&quot; relates to mutual assistance, &quot;implementation of commands&quot; is like a local noble, and &quot;nobility&quot; refers to a sovereign.)</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired, &quot;What about the relevance of evil within?&quot; Qi Bo explained, &quot;In those who are within the enforcement of law, their afflictions are swift and perilous; in those within the implementation of commands, their afflictions are gradual and enduring; in those within nobility, their afflictions are abrupt and fatal.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: Wang Bing adds that the enforcement of law is the standard for officials, so if it becomes corrupt, the consequences are swift and dangerous. The local noble does not have the power of enforcement, therefore harm comes slowly and is manageable. The noble&#39;s authority is inviolable, hence if afflicted, the outcome is abrupt and lethal.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How about the ease of positions?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;When a ruler is in place, ministers are compliant; when a minister occupies the position of a ruler, there is rebellion.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In a year, the heavens cycle through three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter degree within a day, completing one full turn around the Earth in one day while progressing one degree. Each year comprises three hundred sixty-five days and an additional twenty-five quarts. Thus, in one year, it completes one full turn around the heavens, returning to two cycles. Over four years, this accumulates to a full hundred quarts, forming one record.</p>
<p>Therefore, the years associated with the tiger, horse, and dog share a common energy, as do the years of the rabbit, goat, and pig; the years of the dragon, monkey, and rat; and the years of the snake, rooster, and ox, concluding and beginning anew.</p>

<p>Application refers to the movement of yin and yang as they ascend and descend. The origin is based on the six energies of wind, cold, heat, dampness, drought, and fire. The position pertains to the steps of the three yin and three yang. The interaction of energies refers to the convergence of the energies of heaven and earth, the yin and yang, entering and exiting from above and below.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor asked: What is meant by the exchange of qi? Qi Bo replied: The positions of above and below are where the exchange of qi occurs, which is where humanity resides. Therefore it is said that above the celestial pivot, the heavenly qi governs; below the celestial pivot, the earthly qi governs. The distribution of qi is such that human qi follows it, and all things arise from it. This is what is meant.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What is the initial middle? Qi Bo replied: The initial state is generally thirty degrees and has its peculiarities; the central qi follows the same principles. The Emperor asked: What constitutes the initial middle? Qi Bo replied: It is what divides heaven and earth. The Emperor expressed desire to hear this completely! Qi Bo said: The initial refers to earthly qi, while the middle refers to heavenly qi.</p>
<p>This clarifies the exchange of yin and yang of heaven and earth. Before the half year, heavenly qi governs, and the initial qi of the heavenly is derived from the left of the earth. After the half year, earthly qi governs, and the initial qi of the earthly begins from the right of the heavens. This describes the intersection of above and below. Within one qi, there is also the distinction of initial and middle, including the peculiar. Each governs for thirty days, four hours, seven minutes, and five tenths. The initial qi of the earth, the central qi of the heavens, is within one qi, and thus there is the convergence of the yin and yang of heaven and earth. Hence it is said that within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: How do the rise and fall occur? Qibo replied: The rise and fall of qi is the transformation of heaven and earth. The Emperor said: I wish to know how this transformation works. Qibo replied: When it rises, it then falls; the falling is called heaven; when it falls, it then rises; the rising is called earth. The qi of heaven descends, flowing to the earth; the qi of the earth ascends, rising to the heavens. Thus, the high and the low summon each other, the rise and fall are interconnected, and transformation occurs.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Excellent! When cold and damp encounter, when dryness and heat bear upon one another, is there any interval between them? Qibo replied: Qi has phases of dominance and recovery; this phase of dominance and recovery involves virtue and transformation, utility and change; when change occurs, then evil qi resides within it. </p>
<p>This discusses the six qi governing heaven and earth; they have differences in domination, virtue, transformation, and calamity. People also undergo beginnings and endings due to the transformations of yin and yang. Encountering refers to the coming together of the six qi; arriving refers to the six qi&#39;s presence; aligning refers to the direct influence of the six qi through the seasons. Dominance refers to the overwhelming presence, virtue refers to the auspiciousness of qi, utility refers to the movement of essence, change refers to the order of recovery, and evil refers to the changing qi.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: What does that mean? Qi Bo replied: The birth of things arises from transformation, and the extremes of things are due to change. The interaction of change and transformation is where success and failure stem from.</p>
<p>[Note: The Great Treatise on the Five Constants states: Qi begins and gives rise to transformations; Qi ends and manifests change. Therefore, nurturing and collecting are the completion of things, while disasters and alterations are the cause of their downfall. Thus, humans and all things grow within the transformations of yin and yang, and their success and failure depend on these changes.]</p>
<p>Hence, qi has cycles of return, and action has speeds of delay and quickness. These four elements result in transformation and change, leading to the coming of the wind.</p>
<p>[Note: The cycles of return in qi refer to the qi of heaven and earth, having both ascension and descension. The speeds of action refer to the entry and exit of yin and yang, which can be slow or fast. Wind is the movement of qi in heaven and earth, capable of nurturing all things, yet also able to harm them.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The slow and fast return is how the wind is born. Therefore, the reason for transformation and change is due to the fluctuations between prosperity and decline! Why do success and failure fluctuate within?</p>
<p>Qi Bo replied: Success and failure arise from movement; if movement does not cease, transformation occurs.</p>
<p>[Note: Movement refers to the unceasing rise and fall, entry and exit. The success and failure of all things depend on the changes of yin and yang, thus the mechanisms of success and failure lie within these transformations.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Is there a fixed period? Qi Bo replied: Not being born and not transforming is the period of stillness.</p>
<p>[Note: This is like being not born and not transformed, leading to stillness in the end. It refers to the qi of heaven and earth, which is in constant movement.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Is there a time when there is no birth and transformation?</p>
<p>Qibo said: When in and out is wasted, the divine mechanisms wither away; when rising and falling cease, the vital energy becomes isolated and precarious. This reiterates that the opening and pioneering of heaven and earth involve motion and transformation. &quot;In and out&quot; refers to closing and opening. &quot;Mechanism&quot; is the pivot, and &quot;divine mechanism&quot; refers to the unpredictable changes of Yin and Yang. Just as closing and opening are like doors and shutters, and the pivot is the turning point, without the pivot, there can be no closing or opening; without closing and opening, there is no turning. Thus, when in and out is wasted, the divine mechanisms wither. </p>
<p>Rising and falling refer to the transitions of cold and heat. The rising and falling of Yin and Yang emanate from the earth, while heaven encompasses the earth. Therefore, when rising and falling cease, the external vital energy becomes isolated and precarious; isolation means there is no birth. The &quot;Lower Classic&quot; states: Those rooted in the external are termed vital energy; when energy halts, transformation ceases. Those rooted within are termed divine mechanisms; when the divine departs, the mechanism ceases.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, without entrance and exit, there can be no growth, maturity, aging, and passing; without rising and falling, there can be no growth, transformation, storage, and collection. Thus, rising and falling, entering and exiting, are present in all things. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Passing&quot; refers to death. &quot;Growth, maturity, aging, and passing&quot; pertains to animals; &quot;growth, transformation, storage, and collection&quot; pertains to plants. All tangible things are called vessels. The relationship between humans and all things arises from the interaction of the energies of heaven and earth. The processes of growth, maturity, aging, and passing depend on the rising and falling and entering and exiting of energies, which is why there is no vessel devoid of these movements.)</p>
<p>Thus, vessels are the universe of transformation. When vessels disperse, the essence of transformation ceases. Therefore, nothing lacks entrance and exit, and nothing lacks rising and falling.</p>
<p>(Note: All tangible things are influenced by the energies of heaven, earth, and the four directions to grow and transform. Thus, vessels represent the universe of transformation. When vessels disperse, the yang returns to heaven and the yin returns to earth, causing transformation to cease. Therefore, all things possess these movements of rising and falling and entering and exiting, which are determined by success and failure.)</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the transformation and balance of the forces between heaven and earth, noting distinctions in size and distance. For instance, small creatures like the morning mushroom are unaware of the cycles of day and night, while larger beings like the great mulberry tree experience the seasons over centuries. The forces of heaven (yang) are active, and those of earth (yin) are still; daytime is active while nighttime is still, representing the nearer cyclical changes. The cosmos began at the beginning of the day (zi) and the earth was established in the early hours (chou). The continuous movement of heaven and earth ultimately returns to a state of unity (xu-hai), a more distant transformation, where everything is still and unmoving.</p>
<p>Therefore, maintaining constant principles is of utmost importance; deviation from these will lead to disasters. Thus, it is said that being formless leads to no afflictions; this is a principle to uphold.</p>
<p>As humans exist amidst these forces, it is important to maintain a consistent state; an awareness of potential troubles is crucial, and going against the natural order can invite disasters. Hence, the idea that to transcend earthly forms allows for freedom from worries.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked whether there is a state of existence beyond birth and transformation. Qi Bo replied affirmatively, stating that such a state exists for those who are in harmony with the Dao—these are true individuals. The Emperor acknowledged this as good.</p>
<p>This implies that those who exist between heaven and earth without being constrained by transformation are indeed true individuals. True individuals are those who hold the balance of heaven and earth, mastering the interplay of yin and yang, enduring beyond the decay of the cosmos, and experiencing neither movement nor stillness in unison with heaven and earth.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<p>Note: The position of Qi refers to the Five Movements and Six Qi, each governing the positioning of heaven and the marking of earth, determining the seasons and timing. The position of heaven is the manifestation of the heavens. The position of earth corresponds to the six seasonal phases. Humans dwell in the intersection of the Qi of heaven and earth, adapting to the changes of yin and yang across the four seasons, which pertains to human affairs.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when the forces of fate are excessive, the atmospheric influences of the four seasons arrive ahead of their natural time; conversely, when the forces of fate are insufficient, the atmospheric influences of the four seasons arrive later than their natural time. This describes the changes brought about by the influences of the year, to which people must respond. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What happens when the transformation of the five influences is excessive?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;When the Wood of the year is excessive, the winds are rampant, and the Earth of the Spleen suffers from evil influences. The people experience symptoms like loose stools, reduced appetite, a heavy and discomforted body, rumbling intestines, and abdominal distension. This corresponds to the Year Star.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: When the Wood of the year is excessive, it overcomes the Earth influences, causing illnesses related to the Spleen. Loose stools, reduced appetite, rumbling intestines, and abdominal fullness are all disorders of the Spleen. The Spleen governs the muscles and limbs, hence the feeling of heaviness and discomfort arises, as Earth is damaged and cannot control Water, allowing Water&#39;s influences to rise and affect the Heart. This corresponds to the Year Star, which is greatly luminous. The Year Star refers to Jupiter. Thus, too much Wood influence corresponds to certain years.) </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The excess of indulgence leads to self-harm. A good anger is a disease of the liver and will. The Jueyin and Du meridians meet at the top of the head, hence the dizziness and headaches.

If the Chongyang is cut off, there is no hope of recovery. It also corresponds to the planet Tai Bai.</p>
<p>The transformation of qi refers to the energy of the earth. Excessive wind and wood cause the transformation of qi to fail in establishing its governance. The vital energy refers to the wood&#39;s energy. When the wind is dominant, it moves; hence the clouds and objects above are flying, and the plants and trees below are unsettled. The side pain and severe vomiting happen when indulgence reaches its peak, leading to injury. When the nourishing energy of food enters the stomach, it spreads its essence to the liver. When the liver qi is weak and reverses, it results in severe vomiting. The Chongyang refers to the stomach meridian.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

The method of assessing internal energy states states: when suffering from kidney disease, the body feels heavy; when the kidneys are deficient, there is pain in the upper and lower abdomen. The kidneys are the source of life energy; when kidney energy is affected by pathogens, it leads to coldness in the hands and feet. If the will is not settled, it results in a lack of joy. Human actions rely on energy and blood circulation. The kidneys are the source of blood and energy; when the body feels heavy and burdened, water cannot support fire.

Tai Bai refers to the planet Venus. When the metal energy prevails, it corresponds upwards to the brightness of Tai Bai. When the metal influence is excessive, it leads to years categorized by the metal element.

This corresponds to the star of the comet. </p>
<p>Note: An excessive chill can lead to a deficiency in metal energy and a resurgence of fire energy. Wheezing and coughing indicate lung disease.

This is reflected in the celestial bodies, specifically the star Chen.</p>
<p>(Note: The explanation describes how excessive water leads to flowing cold air, thereby harming the heart’s fire. The cold air overpowers the fire, resulting in symptoms like fever and irritability. Heart palpitations are caused by water vapor affecting the heart. Restlessness arises when fire energy does not harmonize with yin energy. The extreme cold causes cold limbs, and a decline in the fire of the Triple Burners leads to general coldness and mental unrest, manifesting as delirium. Cold is associated with winter, hence the early arrival of cold air in this year&#39;s climate, which correlates with the star Chen, representing water. The excessive water causes the star Chen to shine more brightly. When water is overly excessive, it relates to the years particularly abundant in fire.) </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The above corresponds with the Zheng Star. [Note: This water is excessively indulgent and harmful to oneself. The theory of the viscera states that a kidney disease results in a large abdomen, swollen legs, coughing, sweating at night, and aversion to wind. This is because the water evil overflows, and when the earth cannot control it, there is a large abdomen and swollen legs; when the water qi rises, there is coughing. The sun&#39;s qi is birthed in the water and rules the surface; if the water overflows, the source dries up, and the sun&#39;s qi has no means of sustenance. The exterior yang is deficient, hence sweating and aversion to wind. When heavy rain arrives, dust and mist become thick, indicating that the water is indulgent yet the earth’s qi recovers. The Six Elements Discussion states: where the Taiyin reaches, dampness arises, ultimately leading to rainfall. The thick mist indicates that the earthy damp qi is rising. With the earth&#39;s qi restored, the Zheng Star shines even brighter.] When the sun is above, rain, ice, snow, and frost fall irregularly, causing humidity to transform things. This results in reverse symptoms of abdominal fullness, intestinal sounds, diarrhea, undigested food, and thirst leading to bizarre behavior. If the Shenmen is extinguished, there is no cure for death. Above it also corresponds with the Yinghuo and Chen Stars. [Note: The one above the sun indicates that the cold water governs the atmospheric qi, adding to its presence above, namely in the years of Bingchen and Bingxu, which are the years of the heavenly sign. The mingling of cold water is why rain, ice, snow, and frost fall irregularly. Ice represents the variability of cold water. When rain descends, the earth becomes damp and things transform. The ailments of abdominal fullness, intestinal sounds, diarrhea, and undigested food are all proofs of the water overflowing and the earth succumbing. The spleen cannot transport its fluids, hence the thirst. The humidity appears prominently, hence the strange behavior. Shenmen refers to the heart channel. The water qi is exceedingly strong, leading to a dimming of the Yinghuo and a brighter Chen Star.]<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The grass and trees receive the punishment of metal and thus flourish again. If the wood is insufficient, it cannot control the earth; hence, the transformation of energy becomes urgent. The energy of metal and earth prevails, corresponding to Venus, the bright star. The wood succumbs to the control of metal, hence it governs the azure hue appearing early, and when it is controlled, it embodies the principle of transformation and vitality.</p>
<p>In all the yin years, the influence is not sufficient; thus, there are only the years of Ding Mao, Ding You, Ji Si, Ji Hai, Xin Chou, and Xin Wei. In those years of Gui and Yi, there is no superior conjunction of heaven.</p>
<p>As for the revival, it is the mother of the bulging offspring. The flowing fire refers to the great fire descending. At the turn of summer and autumn, the great fire flows westward, scorching the metal with heat. The long summer, where the wet earth dominates energy, results in damp conditions turning dry due to the summer heat, causing all things to become soft and brittle, leading to withered grass and trees. The lower body regenerates, and blossoms and fruits transform simultaneously. Diseases of cold and heat—sores, rashes, abscesses—occur. This corresponds to the wandering star (Mars) and Venus above, while the grains are firm and white.</p>
<p>(Note: Revival refers to the mother’s accumulated energy. Flowing fire indicates the great fire pouring downward. At the transition between summer and autumn, the great fire flows westward, scorching the metal. The long summer, ruled by damp earth, becomes hot and dry, making all things brittle and leading to withered vegetation. Fire governs the long energy, thus the lower body regenerates. Summer is the season of blossoms, while autumn signifies maturity; therefore, fire controls metal, allowing blossoms and fruits to transform together. Cold and heat afflictions are all illnesses caused by summer heat. This corresponds to Mars shining brightly above and Venus dimming its brightness. The grains are white and firm, reflecting the autumn&#39;s harvest, thus they mature early.) </p>
<p>With the early arrival of White Dew, the harvest killing energy manifests. Cold rain harms the crops, and insects feast on the sweet, yellow plants. The spleen earth suffers from evil influences, the red aura transforms afterwards, and heart energy treats late. The influence above overcomes the lung metal, resulting in the white energy being subdued, and thus the grains do not mature. Coughing and sneezing occur.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This discussion occurs in the year influenced by Yangming, where the metal energy is prominent, resulting in an early arrival of White Dew at the transition from summer to autumn, and the lethal energy is activated while fire remains subdued. In years lacking this influence, the prevailing energies act recklessly, causing self-weakening in their positions, allowing the rebalancing energies to prevail. Now, under Yangming’s influence, the metal energy is indeed strong. When metal energy is strong, its offspring energy can also prevail; thus, the offspring of fire and wood wish to regain their influence, but the offspring of metal can counter them, leading to subsequent transformations in red energy. Cold rain, the essence of cold water, is the energy of metal’s offspring. Following the prolonged energies, the command to store early acts, therefore causing harm to all things, which disrupts the growth of grains. Insects respond to the humid air of rain and thrive, yet at the transition from summer to autumn, the earth energy is in action but overpowered by the cold rain, resulting in insects consuming sweet and ripe crops. The spleen’s earth element is affected by this malevolent force, leading to symptoms in the lungs and nasal passages, hence causing coughs and clear nasal discharge.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

This is because wood stagnates, causing the gallbladder energy to be unrelaxed, hence the sighing as a means to release it. Insects are affected by cold and dampness, feeding on the sweet yellow energy trapped in the spleen, which in turn causes water to invade the earth. Thus, when the earth fails to circulate properly, the stored energy is mobilized, and although metal restores it, the offspring also follow this. When metal energy is restored, the dark valley is damaged. When water energy prevails, the dark valley diminishes, leading the people to have less and less flavorful food.

<p>Then suddenly, cold rain arrives, leading to sleet, hail, frost, and snow, which kills living things. Yin grows constricted, and yang reverses and ascends, causing pain in the head and temples, extending to heat at the crown. This corresponds to the star Chen.</p>

<p>(Note: When metal is weak and fire is excessive, water then returns, thus the sudden cold rain. The subsequent sleet kills living things, representing the transformation of cold water. In autumn and winter, yang energy should be stored in the yin organs. The constricting cold air reverses and presses against yang outside, causing it to ascend, resulting in pain in the head and warmth at the crown, which corresponds to the brighter star Chen. Water exceeds its long energy, thus the red valley does not form. The cold energy of water ascends, forcing the heart&#39;s fire to flare outward, hence people suffer from mouth ulcers, and in severe cases, heart pain.)</p>

<p>(Note: When the water flow is insufficient, earth prevails, hence the great spread of humidity. The weakness of water cannot restrain fire, resulting in the long energy being counterproductive. When fire and earth combine, the transformation of earth&#39;s energy is rapid, thus summer rains occur frequently. The records of the six elements state that wherever the Taiyin reaches, it causes transformation into clouds and rain. This corresponds to the brighter star Zhen.

<p>The notes explain that water is weak and earth prevails, so the intense winds arise, causing the grass to droop and trees to drop, hence the lack of vibrant growth. The Yangming element, associated with earth, controls the face, resulting in the complexion changing frequently. Yangming regulates the muscles and tendons, which are all connected to the bones; thus, when the earth energy is harmed, the muscles and bones are affected too. The shivers and trembles refer to sudden movements. When vision is unclear, it indicates that the eyes are impaired due to the winds damaging the blood. When things break due to wind, it is described as splitting. Rashes occur when wind enters the diaphragm; it causes pain above in the heart and below in the abdomen.

<p>These words imply that the five celestial bodies signify the cycles of the years, yet they do not respond to the abrupt changes of the seasonal energies. To &quot;bear the heaven&quot; means to accept the energies of the five cycles, which align with the transformations of the heavenly stems. By following the heavenly order and acting accordingly, there should be no unprovoked actions, and one will always respond to the five celestial bodies. Abrupt actions arise from the exchanges of the seasonal energies, which do not align with the five celestial bodies; hence, it is again said: responses are constant, but abrupt actions do not receive a response. </p>
<p>&quot;Constant&quot; refers to the five cycles governing the year, which may have excessive or deficient energies and display equilibrium in their interactions. &quot;Abrupt&quot; refers to the energies of the five directions and four seasons, which may suddenly bring about transformations, decrees, disasters, or changes.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How is this to be responded to? Qibo replied: Each follows its own energy transformations.</p>
<p>&quot;Energy transformations&quot; refer to the transformations of the five cycles’ energies. The energy of the Jia and Ji cycles transforms into earth, the energy of the Yi and Geng cycles transforms into metal, the energy of the Bing and Xin cycles transforms into water, the energy of the Ding and Ren cycles transforms into wood, and the energy of the Wu and Ji cycles transforms into fire. The years governed by the five yang energies are excessive, while those governed by the five yin energies are deficient, and each corresponds to the five elements in heaven.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The path refers to the route of the five stars. To retain long means to delay and prolong. Guarding against retreat means to go against the advance and maintain its measure. Being small means that light does not manifest. Observing the lower realms refers to observing the distinctions below, in relation to the virtues and faults of rulers and subjects. </p>
<p>To leave by the path and return swiftly, meandering and passing it by, is called inspecting the overlooked faults. </p>

<p>Staying for a long time and revolving, either departing or adhering, is called deliberating on calamity and its virtues. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: To stay for a long time means to maintain one&#39;s position and not depart. Revolving means to rotate and circulate.

<p>When qi overcomes one another, there is harmony; when it does not, there is illness. Severe affliction from the pathogenic influence leads to serious conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Qi refers to the transformative energy. According to the Treatise on the Six Organs and Their Correspondences, illness arises upon change; what is overcome is subtle, while what is not is illness, leading to severe affliction from the pathogenic influence resulting in death. Thus, if conditions are not right, it remains subtle; when conditions are right, it becomes severe. This refers to the transition of qi: spring transforms into the energy of late summer, late summer into winter qi, winter transitions to the heat of summer, summer shifts to autumn qi, and autumn reverts back to spring qi. The concept of achieving the victories of the five elements in their appropriate times leads to the mutual victory and transformation of seasonal qi, resulting in harmony.

<p>The Emperor said: &quot;What happens when it is inadequate?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Wood represents waning harmony, Fire indicates concealed brightness, Earth stands for lowered supervision, Metal means following change, and Water signifies diminished flow.&quot;</p>
<p>This describes the inadequacy of the five movements, each having its own designation. When the Wood element is lacking, it cannot spread the warm and harmonizing qi and therefore weakens.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Three Energies refer to the balanced energy and the extremes of excess and deficiency. The balanced motion of wood represents harmony. When the virtue of wood circulates freely, the yang energy expands and the yin energy diffuses, encompassing the five energies of growth, transformation, storage, and their emergence. When the growth energy is harmonious, all five energies are balanced. &quot;Duan&quot; signifies uprightness, while &quot;Sui&quot; embodies softness and obedience. The straight and curved represent the characteristics and utility of wood. &quot;Sheng Rong&quot; refers to the vitality of wood’s growth and transformation. &quot;Lei&quot; pertains to the classification of things. The emergence and scattering signify the governance by wood. &quot;Wen He&quot; indicates the warmth and harmony of spring. The wind in the sky represents the commands of wood. Within the organs, it corresponds to the liver, which fears the clarity that wood resists against metal. It relates to the eyes among the sensory organs. In the grains, it corresponds to hemp, which resembles wood in form and has a green hue. In fruits, it represents the season, appearing green and tasting sour. The core contains the kernel, which is split into two parts, representing the origin of wood’s vitality. Caterpillars, like the dense forests of grass and trees, are born from vegetation. Dogs exhibit a courageous disposition, responding to the rising energy of spring with anger. The liver governs the tendons, therefore its nourishment is in the sinews. Abdominal urgency and fullness are symptoms of liver illness. &quot;Jiao&quot; is the sound of wood, which thrives in water, making it strong and resilient. The number eight is the manifestation of wood. In the era of rising brightness, governance is based on rectified yang, where virtues are widely applied and the five transformations are balanced.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

In the heavens, it manifests as the decree of cold water. In the organs, it corresponds to the kidneys, which are sensitive to dampness; water fears earth. The kidneys open to the two yin passages, thus they govern them. The bean is the valley of water. Its dark brown color and salty flavor are the essence of the kidneys. Moisture refers to that which contains liquid within. Scaled creatures arise from water. The kidneys govern bone marrow, hence their nourishment is found in marrow. The kidneys are the source of vitality; thus when one is ill, the hands and feet become cold. The sound of feathers is associated with water. Six represents the number characterized by water.</p>
<p>Therefore, to allow life and not to kill, to nurture and not to punish, to transform and not to constrain, to gather and not to harm, to store and not to repress—this is called harmonious Qi. </p>
<p>Thus, in the years governed by wood, life energy is obtained without the harshness of metal. In the years governed by fire, the nurturing energy flows without the constraints of water. In the years of earth, transformative energy flourishes without the governance of wood. In the years of metal, gathering energy is achieved without the harm of fire. In the years of water, storing energy is possible without the repression of earth. This is called the year of harmonious Qi.</p>
<p>The principles of harmony are said to conquer life. When life energy does not govern, transforming energy is then exalted.

If the Metal energy is strong, the life force of Wood cannot establish its governance. If the Wood governance is not established, then the Earth energy has no fear, and the transformative energy rises. When Wood declines, the Fire energy does not flourish, thus the breath stabilizes. Since the Metal energy is abundant, the collection and commands happen early. Coolness represents Metal transformation, wind corresponds to Wood transformation, and clouds and rain represent Earth transformation; this occurs because the Wood operation is insufficient, hence there are aspects of Metal and Earth transformation. When the vital energy does not govern, the grasses and trees flourish late. The collection and commands arrive early; thus, the crust is dry and the fruits fall.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Convergence is the essence of metal. Gathering is the function of wood. Movement indicates the internal onset of illness; emergence indicates the external manifestation of symptoms. Binding indicates contraction; obstruction indicates thoroughness; restraint indicates urgency; relaxation indicates non-convergence; these are all ailments of the tendons. The Golden Chamber&#39;s true words state: In the east, the liver is wood, and its illness manifests as fright. The organ is the liver. Its fruits are jujubes and plums, its shells are pits, its grains are millet and rice, its flavors are sour and pungent, its colors are pale, its animals are dogs and chickens, its insects are hairy and shelled, its sounds are those of horns and merchants. Due to the inadequacy of wood&#39;s growth, it is thus transformed by metal and earth. It governs fog and dew, evoking melancholy, overpowering wood; its illness involves agitation and dread, a liver condition, as it stems from metal&#39;s transformation. Judgment means half. The lesser horn and judgment merchant are collectively referred to as the year of the six ding, a year when wood&#39;s growth is insufficient. The horn indicates the sound of wood, so when wood&#39;s growth is insufficient, it governs the lesser horn. Metal is also engaged; thus half aligns with the merchant&#39;s metal transformation. The upper horn and correct horn are the same as the years of ding-si and ding-hai. In those years, it encounters the Jueyin celestial official, and since wood&#39;s growth is inadequate, it receives celestial assistance, thus resembling the harmonious correct horn. The upper merchant and correct merchant are identical in the years ding-mao and ding-you. In those years, it meets the Yangming celestial official, hence referred to as the upper merchant. With insufficient wood growth, half of the merchant transforms, while also coinciding with the Yangming celestial official&#39;s time, so metal is fully engaged, aligning with the authentic merchant of balanced assessment.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, ailments manifesting as limb atrophy, sores, and abscesses, along with sweet pests, all arise from a surfeit of metal energy harming the liver. The upper palace shares qualities with the main palace, corresponding to the years of Ding Chou and Ding Wei, when the Tai Yin governs the heavens. Hence, it is called the upper palace. During this time, wood does not flourish; its transformative energy is thus weakened, but it also receives assistance from the heavenly governance. This allows the earth to dominate and aligns with the cycle of transformation, thus making the upper palace akin to the main palace. The autumn winds are harsh and the metal energy is excessive. The heat blazes and boils—this indicates the return of fire. Disasters and misfortunes are associated with the eastern position of Zhen. The term &quot;return&quot; refers to decay arising from wood, and the fire element is represented by flying, indicating the fire generated within wood itself. Maggots are the offspring of flies; when maggots enter ash, they transform into flies. Flies prefer warmth and despise cold, flying by day and hiding at night. The pheasant, as a kind of bird, embodies the transformative energy of fire. The rapidity of thunder is called ting; when wood experiences extreme accumulation, fire wraps around it, producing the energy known as thunder. Thus, the I Ching states that Zhen represents thunder.</p>
<p>The record of hidden brightness is called &quot;victorious growth.&quot; When the vital energy is not expressed, it becomes repressed. Collecting energy through regulation leads to balance. The effect of cold clarity is repeated, while heat leads to lightness. Following transformation, life emerges; it grows but does not extend. It becomes substantial yet remains immature, encountering transformation while already aged. The yang energy is restrained, causing hibernating insects to conceal themselves early.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cold is persistently clear, and the heat is gradually diminishing; water prevails over fire. As the transformative energy of the earth achieves balance, living things are able to grow. If the energy is not expressed, growth will stall, and thus even the young that have become real will age when they encounter the transformative energy of long summer. The cold and clarity cause the yang energy to retreat. The hidden energy is utilized, causing hibernating insects to come out early. When the energy is stagnant, water restrains its fire. When it is harshly utilized, the nature of fire desires to manifest. The manifesting is the governance of fire. When the manifest becomes concealed, it transforms and becomes cold, producing pain, as the victory of cold leads to pain. The organ associated with the heart is represented by fruits such as chestnuts and peaches, real items like mulberries, grains like beans and rice, flavors like bitterness and saltiness, colors like cinnabar, livestock like horses and pigs, creatures like insects with feathers and scales, and sounds like musical notes from feathers—all experience inadequate movement of fire and thus are influenced by the transformations of metal and water.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Confusion and sorrow cloud the mind, leaving it insufficient; thus, influenced by water, the heart&#39;s fire is diminished. The concept of &quot;lesser fortune&quot; and &quot;lesser wings&quot; both refer to the six Gui years. &quot;Lesser fortune&quot; represents a fire tone, which lacks vigor; hence it is called lesser fortune. Minor engagements occur, therefore lesser fortune and lesser wings transform similarly. The Upper Shang and the True Shang share the same characteristics; they correspond to the Gui-Mao and Gui-You years, where the heavens favor the sun&#39;s brightness, hence named Upper Shang. Metal fears nothing but gains the aid of the heavens, marking the cycle of fire&#39;s movement and enforcing fair governance; thus, the years of Upper Shang share the same atmosphere as those of True Shang. The combination of metal and water is victorious, yet causes harm to the heart. The atmosphere is heavy and cold, and the intense cold prevails. Relentless rain brings about the return of earth. Disasters and misfortunes are expected from the south of the Li position. Dull clouds obscure the sun. Sudden downpours and excessive rain signify changes in the earth. Thunder shakes the ground, causing fire to surge forth.</p>
<p>The chronicle of the low overseers is called diminished transformation. The energy of transformation does not command, and governance becomes pronounced. When the energy is harmonized, rain becomes misaligned. When energy is contained and balanced, cold winds arise.

The soil is moist, while the water springs diminish; thus, the earth prevails over water. The plants grow lush and full, thriving on the energy of growth. Moisture accumulates, a quality of the earth; infiltration serves the function of water. Its movements are firm and still; the earth controls water, resulting in accumulation.

The fruits, such as dates and apricots, the moist flesh, grains like millet and broomcorn, flavors of sweetness and saltiness, deep colors, livestock such as pigs and cattle, scales of insects, and sounds of feathers and palaces—all relate to the insufficient movement of water, thus they are transformed by the influence of fire and earth. Dust accumulates heavily, a sign of the earth&#39;s dominance. Weakness and rigidity below signify kidney ailments. Here, the insufficient movement of water reverses into transformation by earth. Those sharing the lesser feathers and palaces are collectively called the years of the six辛. Feathers symbolize the sound of water; since the movement of water is lacking, it is called lesser feathers. The earth takes on functions, hence it assimilates with the lesser palace. The upper palace being the same as the central palace refers to the years of辛丑 and辛未, as it is under the influence of太阴 overseeing the heavens, thus called the upper palace. The earth partially assumes functions and also receives aid from the heavens; hence, the record of lesser feathers corresponds with the years of the central palace. Difficulty in urination, as evil injures the kidneys, results in a failure of kidney energy to transform. Dust clouds and sudden rains indicate great indulgence in the soil.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fur symbolizes the gathering, born from the feelings of spring&#39;s forest air; thus, the fox and weasel display fur, making their master the fox and weasel. Therefore, when riding in danger, one moves slowly to arrive. Cruelty and lack of virtue lead to disasters befalling them. The minor returns to the minor, and the severe returns to the severe; this is the nature of existence.</p>
<p>[Note: This summarizes the previous text, stating that if the five movements do not extend, the prevailing energy moves in danger, arriving slowly. Only excess overcomes, without the virtue of harmony and auspiciousness, leading to offspring coming to seek revenge, with disasters befalling them. Overcoming the minor returns to the minor, and overcoming the severe returns to the severe; this is the regular ebb and flow of energy.]</p>
<p>The record of emergence is called the initiation of arrangement. The earth loosens and leaks, the azure energy permeates. Yang harmony spreads and transforms, while Yin energy follows. Vital energy purifies and cultivates, all things flourish. Its transformations create, its energies are beautiful, its governance spreads, its commands are clear and free, its movements are vibrant and rapid, its virtues resonate, while its changes shake and pull. Its grains are millet and rice, its livestock are chickens and dogs, its fruits are plums and peaches, its colors are blue, yellow, and white, its tastes are sour, sweet, and spicy, its imagery is spring. Its pathways are the Foot, Liver, and Spleen, its insects are hair and shell, its substances are firm inside and outside. Its ailments arise from anger, matching those of the Upper Horn and Upper Commerce. If the upper journey encounters obstructions, its energy becomes reversed, and its ailment manifests as vomiting and diarrhea. If one neglects virtue, then energy recedes. In autumn, the energy becomes vigorous and piercing; in severe cases, it leads to stagnation and death, with the clean energy greatly manifesting, causing plants and trees to decay. Evil then harms the liver.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The abundant wood element in the year indicates the emergence of all things. Earth receives its transformations and therefore governs dispersal. The azure energy is the energy of wood. Above Jue Yin, wind and wood regulate it, hence Yang and harmony are spread above, while Yin energy follows below. With abundant life force, all things respond and thrive in beauty and fragrance. Dispersing is the governance of wood. Unfurling is the command of Yang and harmony. Dizziness and rapid ascent of wind energy dwell above. The sounds are those of wind and wood. Opening and dividing signify the emergence of spring’s energy. Shaking, pulling, and uprooting represent the changes of wind. The grains like hemp and rice, animals like chickens and dogs, fruits like plums and peaches, colors such as blue, yellow, and white, tastes like sour, sweet, and spicy, insects like furry and shelled, and things that are hard inside and strong outside are all influenced by the excessive wood energy, interconnecting and transforming with each other. Its imagery responds to spring, its channels harmonize with the liver of the foot Jue Yin and the gallbladder of the foot Shao Yang; its organs correspond to the liver and spleen. The illness of anger indicates an excess of liver energy. The great horns (Taijiao) and the Upper Shang being the same indicates that excess energy has a framework; where there is a framework, there is transformation. If the great horns’ year features excessive wood energy, then metal energy supports it, leading to the production of grains like rice and hemp, fruits like plums and peaches, livestock such as chickens and dogs, and insects with fur and shells, all responding to the influence of wood and metal energies, matching the year of Upper Shang. It is said that in all Ren years, there is no presence of Yangming, hence the great horns and Upper Shang are identical.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

The term &quot;upper summons&quot; refers to the influence from above, with the lesser yin&#39;s fire and the lesser yang&#39;s fire, specifically in the years of Renzi, Renwu, Renyin, and Renshen, when wood is abundant and fire energy is present above. When the child resides on the mother, the energy becomes reversed; if it reverses above, it expels; if it reverses below, it is beneficial. Excessive wood invites the return of metal energy, and if the autumn energy is intense and harsh, it leads to death; as grass and trees wither, ailments can harm the liver.</p>
<p>The record of the blazing sun is called flourishing. The yin energy is transformed internally, while the yang energy flourishes externally. The heat of summer brings transformation, allowing all things to thrive.

Its virtue is that of warmth and humidity, and it transforms into an intense boiling. Its grains include wheat and beans, its livestock are sheep and pigs, its fruits are apricots and chestnuts; its colors are red and white, and its flavors are bitter, spicy, and salty.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The passage explains the influence of the summer season and the characteristics of fire energy. It describes how excessive fire leads to a vibrant growth of plants and how heat causes the inward transformation of yin energy. The outward manifestation of yang energy is evident through the bright warmth of summer, which is a time of flourishing and growth.</p>
<p>During this season, the vitality is strong, resulting in high and dynamic energy. The brightness of fire represents clarity in leadership. However, the intensity of heat can also lead to agitation and discomfort. The warmth and humidity contribute to a harmonious atmosphere, while excessive heat can lead to changes and transformations.</p>
<p>Various crops and animals thrive during this time, indicating a rich interplay of elements, including flavors and colors. This reflects the summer&#39;s essence and its connection to various meridians associated with the heart and other organs.</p>
<p>The heart is considered the organ of fire, and its health is crucial, correlating with the lungs, as both are connected in the creation of life according to various ancient texts. It is noted that if heart energy is strong, joy and laughter will follow. Conversely, summer&#39;s heat can lead to fevers and illnesses in the fall, suggesting that imbalances may manifest later.</p>
<p>Thus, the focus is on the balance of fire energy, its seasonal effects, and its implications for health.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the fire element is excessive, it must be restrained by water, leading to the pacification of fire energies; thus, it corresponds to the same principle as the rising brightness and proper alignment. When the fire energy is stabilized and the metal energy is unscathed, then the gathering of energy aligns with the nurturing and transforming energies. In the year of the Upper Feather, the sun governs the heavens. The disease of paralysis is attributed to the sun. The Upper Deployment involves the dual fire of the ruler and minister, corresponding to the years of Wuzi, Wuwu, Wuyin, and Wushen when the fire heat is even more intense, causing the gathering of energy to arrive later and resulting in chaotic governance driven by excessive fire. This brings about water energy recovery, hence the appearance of mists and the possibility of rain, ice, and hail, which leads to injury to the heart. </p>
<p>The records of rich abundance are known as broad transformation. With profound virtue and tranquility, it flows smoothly towards fullness. The essence of extreme yin exists within, fostering the growth of things. Smoke and dust are seen hovering over rich earth. Heavy rains occur in due time, with dampness in effect while dry policies are avoided. Its transformation is round and its energy abundant, its governance is calm and its commands thorough. Its movement is moist and accumulative, its virtue gentle, rich, and deep. Its changes cause shock and swift collapse. Its grains include millet and hemp, its livestock comprises cattle and dogs. Its fruits are jujubes and plums, its colors are dark, foundational, and deep green, its tastes are sweet, salty, and sour. Its symbol represents the long summer, its channels connect to the greater yin and yang brightness, its organs are the spleen and kidneys, its pests are worms and lice, its substance is muscle and kernel.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the earth is abundant and its transformative essence spreads in all directions, thus it is called broad transformation. With thick virtue and the pure essence of earth, it follows nature to be full; this is the fusion of fire and earth. Above the moon, the moist earth governs; hence, in the extreme yin, there is substance, and all things are transformed into existence. The moon represents the utmost yin, where yin energy is substantial, and from this, all things are manifested outwardly. The haze and dust are the essence of the earth. The thick earth is seen between mountains and hills. When heavy rain occurs, the moisture steams upward, ultimately becoming rainfall. &quot;Bi&quot; means to avoid. At the transition from summer to autumn, the moist earth holds sway, leading to an abundance of moisture, hence the dryness of autumn is a result of avoidance. Serenity is the governance of earth, encompassing the regulations of earth&#39;s essence. &quot;Ji&quot; means to gather; when moist, it becomes consolidated and accumulates. Softness and moisture are the virtues of the earth. Tremors may cause abrupt collapse, representing changes in energy. The grains such as millet and hemp, livestock like cattle and dogs, vermin with fur, fruits like jujubes and plums, colors like deep black and gray, and tastes like sweet, salty, and sour, all influence and support one another, leading to transformation. Their channels align with the foot taiyin spleen and foot yangming stomach, and their organs correspond to the spleen and kidneys. When the abdomen is full and the limbs are unable to rise, this is due to the illness of excess moisture. When the earth energy is too strong, the wind returns, and the spleen is harmed in turn. The regulations of solid formation are called gathering and attraction. The heavenly energy is pure, and the earthly energy is clear. Yang energy follows, and yin governs transformation. Dryness executes its order, and things are brought to completion.

The ailments present as wheezing and gasping, with the metal energy being too strong and the lung energy being full. The upper correspondences are related to the lesser yin and lesser yang of fire, specifically the years of Gengzi, Gengwu, Gengyin, and Gengshen—four years. When metal energy is excessive, it is regulated by fire; when metal energy is balanced, it aligns with the same importance as proper commerce. With balanced metal energy, the vitality of wood is not stifled, allowing it to synchronize with the four seasonal energies. The ailment manifests as coughing due to fire injuring the lung. The harshness is overwhelming, causing harm to plants. The emergence of vitality seeks to restore it, which is why great fire flowing westward paradoxically injures the lung.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When governance is excessive, it leads to an overwhelming amount of moisture, and when dust and haze converge, heavy rain falls, which harms the kidneys. </p>
<p>(Note: Water&#39;s excess is described as a flowing overflow. Winter represents concealment, known as sealing and storing. Cold air governs transformation, causing the weather to be severe and still. Water orders the distribution, hence fire&#39;s influence does not manifest. The piercing cold transforms the stiff, cold air, which flows into the water&#39;s nature. The overwhelming flow and discharge of water represent disease. The cold&#39;s chilling atmosphere demonstrates the harmonious nature of cold air. Ice, snow, frost, and hail are extreme forms of cold that undergo changes. The grains such as beans and millet, livestock like pigs and cattle, fruits like chestnuts and jujubes, and insects like scales are nourished and bathed, exhibiting dark colors and flavors—each interacting and transforming together. This imagery corresponds to winter, and it relates to the Kidney and Bladder meridians in Traditional Chinese Medicine, aligning with the heart and kidney organs. The disease of swelling occurs when water is abundant and dominates the earth. The rising moisture signifies an ascent to the sun, with cold water governing the heavens, specifically the years of Bing Chen and Bing Xu. The excess of water prevents the transformation by fire. When water governance is excessive, earth will recover from it. Dust and haze arise from wet air rising. The interaction of air means that dampness ascends to form clouds, while falling weather results in rain. When heavy rain occurs, the kidneys are adversely affected.)</p>

The left being cold and the right cool, as well as the right being hot and the left warm, stem from the hexagrams of the later heaven. The hexagrams of the later heaven are positioned with Li (fire) in the south and Kan (water) in the north, with Zhen (thunder) in the east and Dui (lake) in the west. Because of this arrangement of heaven and earth, the four directions emerge.</p>
<p>Qibo replies: The energies of yin and yang, and the principles of high and low, are merely distinctions of more and less.</p>
<p>The energies of yin and yang refer to the cold and hot energies present in the four directions. The shapes of high and low refer to the earth having elevations and depressions. The terms &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot; refer to the four symbols, which differ according to the energies of the four directions.</p>
<p>The southeast is yang. Yang denotes that its essence descends below, thus it is hot on the right and warm on the left. The northwest is yin. Yin denotes that its essence is revered above, thus it is cold on the left and cool on the right. Consequently, the earth has elevations and depressions, while the energies exhibit warmth and coolness; the higher areas experience cold energies, while the lower areas experience hot energies.</p>
<p>The essence referred to is the refined water born from the unity of heaven.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The weather is influenced by changes, and the essence flows between heaven and earth. Therefore, the theory of the correspondence between yin and yang states that heaven has essence, and earth has form. Heaven represents yang while essence represents yin; the cycle of yin and yang revolves up and down. When essence descends below, yang energy rises above, thus it is hot on the right and warm on the left. When the yin essence is sustained above, yang energy is stored below, hence it is cold on the left and cool on the right. The northwest is high, and the southeast is low; therefore, the high places have cold energy, while the lower places have hot energy. </p>
<p>Thus, those exposed to cold and coolness suffer from swelling, while those in warmth and heat suffer from sores. When one drains excess, swelling subsides; when one sweats, sores heal. This reflects the common principles of the opening and closing of the pores, differing in their nature of abundance and scarcity. </p>
<p>This discussion concerns the rise and fall of essence and energy. In cold and cool environments, the yin energy ascends while yang energy is stored below, leading to much swelling, referred to as &quot;disease due to internal cold.&quot; In contrast, when in warm and hot places, yin energy descends while yang energy ascends, resulting in many sores, known to be related to fire, such as painful and itchy sores. Therefore, when one drains, yin energy descends, and yang energy rises, thus resolving swelling. Sweating, being a yin fluid, causes yin fluid to rise and yang energy to descend, leading to the healing of sores. This interplay of essence and energy within the body, their rise and fall, opening and closing, is the natural principle.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In life, one exists amidst the interplay of the energies of heaven and earth, subject to the differences of cold and heat from the four corners. One should follow these energies and adjust accordingly, and naturally, severe ailments will not arise. The Emperor asked: How is it with longevity and short life? Qibo replied: Yin essence sustains a person&#39;s longevity, while Yang essence leads to a person&#39;s early death. </p>
<p>[Note: Where the Yin essence is preserved, the original energy is firmly stored, thus promoting longevity; where the Yang essence is dispelled, the original Yang is lost outwardly, resulting in many premature deaths. The terms Yin essence and Yang essence suggest that there is essence in the earth and essence in the heavens; in the earth, it is Yin, and in the heavens, it is Yang.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! What about diseases; how should they be treated? Qibo replied: The energy from the northwest is dispersive and cold; the energy from the southeast is gathering and warm. This is what is meant by treating the same disease in different ways.</p>
<p>[Note: The western and northern energy is cold, and when it is firmly established externally, heat builds up internally, hence it is appropriate to disperse the external cold and cool the internal heat. The southeastern energy is warm, and the Yang energy leaks outward, causing internal energy to be weak and cold; therefore, it is suitable to gather the original Yang and warm the cold within. Although the diseases are the same, the treatment methods differ.]</p>
<p>Hence it is said: For cold and cool energies, treat with cold and cool methods, using water to moisten. For warm and hot energies, treat with warm and hot methods, strengthening internal retention. One must align with the energy to achieve balance. The opposite is true for uninvited conditions.</p>
<p>[Note: The cold and cool energies of the northwest cause the Yang heat within a person to become obstructed, thus it should be treated with cold and cool interventions. The process of using water to moisten means to use hot liquid to soak, inducing sweat, opening pores to allow Yang energy to flow freely.]<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the southeastern regions, the climate is warm and hot, which causes people&#39;s pores to open and the yang energy to disperse outward. Therefore, one should treat these conditions with warmth, strengthening the primordial yang to ensure it remains within. What is closed should be opened, and what is opened should be closed. The rising and expanding qi should be collected and stored; the qi that is stored should rise and disperse. It is essential to achieve harmony in qi to achieve balance. For people in the northwest suffering from cold pathogens but feeling warmth, they should also be treated with warmth; conversely, for those in the southeast suffering from heat pathogens but feeling cold, they should be treated with coolness. What is termed &quot;false&quot; is indeed the opposite.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Good! If the energy of a region gives rise to different life spans, what is the reason for this? Qi Bo replied: It is due to the principles of elevation and depression, caused by the topography. High places are governed by yin energy, while low and wet places are governed by yang energy. The strong yang is associated with pre-natal factors, while the strong yin is associated with post-natal factors. This is the consistent rule of geography and the way of transformation and generation.</p>
<p>This further discusses the qi of a specific region, recognizing the differences of yin and yang, cold and hot. In high and lofty mountainous areas, there tends to be more cold and yin; in low and damp areas, there tends to be more heat and yang. The strong yang corresponds to the seasonal qi that arrives at the first instance; the strong yin corresponds to the seasonal qi that arrives later. The coming and going of cold and heat all derive from the earth. This differentiation in geography regarding elevation, density, and the regularity of yin and yang entering and exiting is inherent. The way of transformation and generation refers to the qi of growth, transformation, storage, and collection.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When treated with Yang energy, it promotes growth; when treated with Yin energy, it promotes storage. The Emperor asked: Is there a difference between longevity and early death? Qi Bo replied: Those with abundant energy live long, while those with deficient energy do not. This is due to the differences in the Earth’s characteristics. The smaller ones have minor differences, while the larger ones have significant differences.</p>
<p>Thus, those who heal must understand the heavenly principles and geographical distinctions, the changes of Yin and Yang, the order of energy, as well as the longevity and early death of people and the cycles of life and transformation, in order to comprehend the physical and energetic conditions of individuals. The Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
<p>The heavenly principles refer to the transformative patterns of Heaven. Geographical distinctions refer to the four directions of the Earth. The changes of Yin and Yang concern the excesses and deficiencies of the five movements and six energies, and the balance and imbalance they create. The order of energy refers to the notion that excess indicates pre-Heaven qualities, while deficiency indicates post-Heaven qualities. Those with lower and weaker qualities are pre-Heaven, while those with high and robust qualities are post-Heaven. To understand people&#39;s longevity based on heavenly influences and the dynamics of energy, is to know their physical conditions.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot;: When form and energy are in harmony, there is longevity; when they are not, there is early death. When skin and flesh are connected, there is longevity; when they are not, there is early death. When blood and energy prevail in the channels over form, there is longevity; when they do not, there is early death. When the form is full and the skin is loose, there is longevity; when the form is full and the skin is tense, there is early death. When the energy prevails over the form in a balanced person, there is longevity; when the form and flesh weaken and energy prevails, there is death. When the form prevails over energy, it is perilous.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Regulation of Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Constants of Governance [Part Two]</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In years when there is no illness, why do the bodily energies not respond as they should? Qi Bo replied: It is governed by the celestial weather; there are sources of Qi. [Note: The following three sections discuss the five movements of heaven and the five directions of earth, as well as the six energies of the heavenly overseer governed by springs, which interrelate. Years without illness are not determined by the five movements of heaven and the five directions of earth. Bodily energies are those of the five organs, in accordance with the five movements and five elements. &quot;Not responding and not being used&quot; refers to not being utilized according to the five movements; this is due to the influence of the energies administered by the heavenly overseer, from which the bodily energies derive.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear the conclusion! Qi Bo replied: In the lesser yang, the heavenly overseer, the fire energy descends, the lung energy ascends; the white represents the metal element which is utilized when weeds are afflicted. Fire appears scorched, metal is worn and drained; during the great heat period, there are coughs, sneezes, nasal congestion, oral ulcers, and swelling from cold and heat. [Note: According to the record of Jin Ping, its organ is the lung, its color is white, and it corresponds to metal, all of which reflect the use of the five movements and five elements. The ascent refers to the descent of the heavenly overseer&#39;s energy, fearing its overpowering nature and yielding to it. The energies of the five movements are rooted within and circulated externally; the energies administered by the heavenly overseer are positioned above and descend below. The lung energy ascends, the white corresponds to metal, both aligning with the energy of the heavenly overseer, while not being used by the five movements.]<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When metal is used in the upper regions, then the grass and trees will suffer in the lower regions. When metal transforms from fire, it undergoes change and depletion. Symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion are all indications of lung disease; oral ulcers, chills, fever, and swelling are signs of heat. This is the movement and energy of metal, which reacts with transformation from fire. This discussion of movement and energy is, above, aligned with the transformation of heaven and, with regard to the yearly cycles of heaven, there are only minor distinctions.</p>
<p>The wind moves across the ground, dust and sand are lifted and fly; this leads to symptoms like heart pain, stomach pain, and reversal of qi, causing obstruction. Its main cause is rapidity. </p>
<p>(Note: In the section where lesser yang governs heaven, the greater yin is at the spring; that is why the wind moves across the ground. When the wind prevails, movement occurs, hence dust and sand are lifted. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot Sutra&quot; states that the diseases stemming from the heart&#39;s pericardium which relate to the greater yin include heart pain, worry, and stomach discomfort, indicating that wood is overcoming upwards. The center is earth, when the middle of the stomach is obstructed, it causes upward rebounds. Wind energy is swift, thus its main focus is rapidity.)</p>
<p>When the greater yang governs heaven, the drying energy descends, while the liver energy ascends. The trees flourish and stand tall, then earth suffers; the storms approach, trees are cut down, grasses wither, causing side pain, red eyes, instability, trembling, and weakness in the muscles, making prolonged standing difficult.</p>
<p>(Note: Standing refers to the body of wood; it generally means that the essence of the five elements is on earth, while its function ascends towards heaven. When wood is transformed from heaven, earth suffers. The energy of metal descends, causing trees to be cut and grasses to wither. Symptoms like side pain, red eyes, trembling, and muscle atrophy all indicate diseases related to liver wood.)<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

Fire acts upon the withered, flowing water does not freeze, and hibernating insects emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When the yang ming rules the heavens, then the shaoyin lord’s fire resides in the spring, thus when extreme heat comes, the earth becomes hot. With excessive yang heat, urine changes, and chills and fevers resemble intermittent malaria, hence it is said that summer injuries from heat will lead to autumn fevers. Heart pain arises from fire being rampant within. The term &quot;withered&quot; refers to the time when fire acts upon withered plants, hence flowing water does not freeze, and hibernating insects do not hide.</p>
<p>When the sun rules the heavens, cold energy descends, and heart energy rises, the fire begins to ignite. The metal suffers, and during the cold and clear time, if excessive, water freezes. The fire energy becomes high and bright, the heart is hot and restless, the throat feels dry and thirsty, sneezing produces joy or sadness, and there are frequent yawns, with the heat energy running rampant. Cold then returns, frost does not fall at the proper time, one becomes forgetful, and if severe, there is heart pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Brightness refers to the function of fire. When cold energy descends and heart energy rises, fire naturally flares upwards, while water naturally sinks down, hence fire appears high and bright, while the water becomes cold and solid at the bottom.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the heart is heated and troubled, the throat feels dry and thirsty, as the fire rises above. The lungs are the cover of the heart. Sneezing and sadness indicate the heat of fire burning the metal. Fire is yang, and water is yin; when the balance is lacking, yang rises while yin descends. Those who forget easily are harmed by cold, leading to injuries to the spirit and energy.</p>
<p>Earth is nurturing, and water is abundant; when cold guests arrive, hidden yin transforms, and dampness alters matter. Drinking water causes fullness but not hunger, the skin and flesh are strained, and the meridians are obstructed, leading to swelling and sores on the back.</p>
<p>Note: When the sun governs the heavens, the yin moisture from the earth is found in springs, hence the earth is nurturing. Water being abundant means that it can be controlled by the earth. In the years of the Earth Dog, when the sun governs, the cold water brings its guest energy influencing the three vital energies, and the main energy associated with wet earth governs the four vital energies; thus it is said cold guests have arrived. The transformation of hidden yin refers to the time when summer transitions, with water and moisture combining but without the nurturing of fire and earth, leading to alterations due to dampness. Drinking water to the point of fullness and suffering from strained skin and flesh are both the result of water and dampness illness. The swelling on the back arises from sores appearing there. The classic text states that all swellings and boils arise from the transformation of cold energy. The sun&#39;s cold water governs while the meridians circulate along the back, causing swelling there.</p>
<p>When the jueyin influences the heavens, the wind energy descends, and the spleen energy rises, leading the earth to flourish and emerge yellow.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The wind and wood of the Jueyin control the heavens, while the Shaoyang fire exists in the springs; wood and fire mutually generate, hence fire unleashing its ferocity. The statement about the heat of the earth implies that the Taiyin damp earth is also hot and humid. The description of &quot;red earth below&quot; indicates that the leaves of the trees, though lush, also wither and fall.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The ailments of plants arise from extreme heat flowing, which is worse than in spring and summer. The melting gold and flowing stone indicate excessive heat invading from autumn and winter.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The &quot;heart below&quot; refers to the imbalance between the water and fire energies, as they do not interact. The cracking ground and hard ice indicate the variability of cold water. Pain in the lower abdomen suggests issues with the kidneys. Food being harmful means that water dominates the earth. The kidneys are fundamental, while the lungs are secondary, both accumulating water. When metal is involved, water energy rises to the lungs and ceases activity there. The heart&#39;s energy connects to the tongue, and harmony within the heart allows for understanding the five flavors.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of this summary discusses that the forces of luck which do not conform to the various schools are exceedingly dominant. Thus, the governing energy is subject to control, and the annual cycles give birth to phenomena.</p>
<p>The governing energy refers to the Five Movements being the masters of the Five Energies. The annual cycle, half of the year prior is led by atmospheric conditions; half of the year afterwards is governed by terrestrial conditions. The heavens regulate the six energies to establish the annual cycle, each energy has its generative qualities, and thus the Five Movements have their limits, leading to cases of infertility and incompletion. </p>
<p>The earth&#39;s energy controls what it can overcome, while the heavens regulate over itself. Heaven governs color, and earth governs form. Each of the five types of decline and growth corresponds with its appropriate energy. Therefore, there are cases of pregnancy without result, and treatments that are incomplete; this is the norm of energy. </p>
<p>As for the earth&#39;s energy controlling what it can overcome, this is exemplified by the Liver and its connection to certain worms; likewise, the Kidney corresponds with other insects. The control that the earth has over its form is why it is called earth governing form. </p>
<p>The theory states that when the atmosphere is insufficient, the earth&#39;s energy follows; when the earth&#39;s energy is insufficient, the atmosphere follows. The movement lies in between, and remains constant. Thus, the energy of the Five Movements transforms within the realms of heaven and earth, remaining constant and overpowering the energies that govern the heavens. It states that when the Lesser Yang governs the heavens, the fire energy descends, bringing forward the Metal energy. When the Yangming governs the heavens, the dry energy descends, introducing the White energy.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this world, the five elemental energies rise and fall, entering and exiting, moving continuously without rest. Each has its own mastery and generation, giving rise to all things, and human vitality follows suit. Thus, one cannot fully understand the influences of the five movements and six energies, nor the differences and similarities of excess and deficiency, which are insufficient to describe the processes of life and transformation. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Energy begins and brings forth transformation; when energy disperses, forms arise; when energy spreads, nurturing occurs; and when energy concludes, forms change—its essence is the same. However, the experiences of the five tastes differ in abundance and maturity, leading to variations in their beginning and ending. What is the reason for this? </p>
<p>Qi Bo replied: It is governed by the energies of the earth; without the heavens, there would be no birth, and without the earth, there would be no growth. </p>
<p>[Note: This discussion revolves around the energies of the five movements, which primarily govern the transformation of all things, influenced by the energies of springs; it is not due to the absence of growth from heaven and earth. The term &quot;energy&quot; refers to the transformative energies of the five movements: energy begins and brings forth life, meaning it obtains vital energy; energy disperses and forms arise, meaning it obtains growth energy; energy spreads and nurtures, meaning it obtains transformative energy; and energy concludes and forms change, meaning it senses the energy of storage, where things reach their extreme and transform. These five energies predominantly govern growth, transformation, and storage. From beginning to end, their essence is unified. The transformation through the five tastes is facilitated by the tastes that arise from the transformations of the five movements, which in turn support the earth&#39;s energies.]<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the five phases governs transformation and growth, regulated by the energy of the earth, which is why transformation can be rich or thin, and ripening can vary in amount. The Emperor asked: “I wish to understand this principle!” Qibo replied: “The variations of cold, heat, dryness, and humidity lead to different forms of transformation. Therefore, in the case of Shaoyang, where the spring is cold, no toxic elements arise; its flavor is pungent, its remedy is bitter and sour, and its grains are of a blue hue. The cold and heat, dryness and humidity, are the six energies of heaven in springs, different from the transformations governed by the five phases. Thus, the growth and breeding governed by the five phases get regulated by the earth&#39;s energy, resulting in variations in richness and quantity. Toxicity refers to singularity, indicating that when extremes of cold or heat appear, they generate poisonous energies that are excessive. In the case of Shaoyang fire residing in spring, no cold toxicity arises, exemplifying the differing transformations of cold and heat. For instance, in the years of Xin Si and Xin Hai, when the cold water phase is in effect, and Shaoyang is in springtime, the energy of the earth governs, preventing cold toxicity from manifesting, thereby showing the superiority of earth energy over the transformation of phases. The five colors and five flavors are under the governance of the five phases. When Shaoyang governs heaven, the color white corresponds to metal; this color is regulated by heaven, known as &#39;heaven-regulated color.&#39;”<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

This is the color and flavor of transformation and movement, adhering to the superior regulation of the heavenly. Therefore, it is said that the five flavors are nourished, referring to the five flavors of transformation and movement, which in turn support the earth&#39;s qi. When Lesser Yang is at the spring, then the utmost Yin governs the heavens, thus it primarily oversees bitterness and acidity, with its grains characterized by &quot;azure&quot; and &quot;cinnabar&quot; being mature, drawing from the qi of heaven and earth, rather than from transformation and movement. </p>
<p>In following the guidelines of balance, its color is white, and its flavor is pungent. For example, when Lesser Yang governs the heavens, the white color reflects heavenly transformation. When Lesser Yang is at the spring, then the pungent flavor draws upon the earth&#39;s qi, a manifestation of the qi of heaven and earth, dominating its transformative energy. As for the utmost Yin overseeing the heavens, if the larvae do not complete, and if the utmost Yin is at the spring, then the feathered insects do not thrive. This is the qi of the five movements, dominating its regulation at the spring. Therefore, it is said that each has its regulation, each has its dominance, each has its birth, and each has its completion, referring to the five movements and six qi, each having its generation; if one encounters dominance, then there is no birth or completion.</p>
<p>When Greater Yang is at the spring, damp toxins do not arise; its flavor is sour, its qi is damp, its treatment is pungent, bitter, and sweet, and its grains are cinnabar and white.</p>
<p>(Note: Greater Yang, being associated with dry metal at the spring, is why damp and toxic substances do not arise. Sour is the flavor of wood.)<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The explanation here states that the five flavors are related to their respective transformative energies, adhering to the principles of dominance and control. The term &quot;pure transformation&quot; refers to the Yangming being transformed by the moist earth it encounters, where dryness and moisture combine, leading to harmony in transformation. Metal transforms from earth, hence its salty flavor, which should be preserved and not allowed to overflow due to the fear of the Taiyin&#39;s regulation. The concentrated energy of the Jueyin sees the governing energy of the Shaoyang, thus the spicy flavor appears alongside the flavors of sweetness, sourness, and bitterness. Spiciness is influenced by the control of fire, as transformation follows the regulation of fire. Cold, heat, dryness, and moisture are among the six energies found in springs. Sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty are the five flavors related to the five movements. The combination of dryness and moisture&#39;s pure transformation preserves saltiness, while the concentrated energy of fire transforms spiciness, all governed by the energy of the earth, leading flavors to return to energy transformation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said: To supplement the upper and lower aspects, one follows, and to treat them, one goes against their nature, adjusting based on the variations of cold and heat. Thus, the upper and lower are treated accordingly, and the internal and external are addressed in search of imbalances. For those who can be poisoned, a strong remedy is applied, while for those who cannot withstand poison, a mild remedy is used.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the regulation of vitality (qi) in relation to seasonal changes and environmental influences. It explains that the celestial energy associated with water (represented as the spring energy) can be complemented by sour and bitter flavors to balance its upward and downward movements. It outlines how to address imbalances caused by external winds or internal heat, suggesting that when cold dominates internally, one should treat it with warmth, and when internal heat prevails, it should be countered with coldness.</p>
<p>The process of healing involves assessing the prevailing conditions—whether they are too cold or too hot—and adjusting treatment accordingly. If the energy is strong, it should be moderated; if it is weak, it should be supplemented. The five elemental energies (wuyun) must be harmonized according to their movements, ensuring that any excesses are appropriately managed.</p>
<p>The text also mentions how ailments can manifest based on the relationship between upper and lower energies, or external and internal forces.

<p>(Note: The distinction of old and new illness refers to the poison’s ability to harm, and whether it can be overcome. The mention of varying strengths indicates that some prescriptions may require heavier doses while others may only need lighter ones. Poison can be severe or mild, often manifesting as dampness or dryness, thus care is needed in treating illness; stopping treatment at the right moment is essential to avoid harming the body further.

The flesh, tendons, and bones of the body are all sustained by the transformations and movements of these seasons, which cannot be replaced. Just as spring air nourishes the tendons, summer air nourishes the blood vessels, late summer air nourishes the muscles, autumn air nourishes the skin and hair, and winter air nourishes the bone marrow. The body’s flesh, tendons, and bones are all nourished by the seasonal airs, which should not be contradicted. </p>
<p>The meridians and vessels are what circulate qi and blood and nourish yin and yang. Blood is the essence of spirit; just as the meridians connect the flow of blood and qi to restore what is deficient in spirit, bringing it back in line with those who have no illness. However, if the spirit is restored but the body is still unwell and remains thin and emaciated, one should focus on nurturing the spirit, harmonizing the qi, and waiting patiently for the right time, carefully guarding the qi and preventing any disruption. When the body receives the seasonal nourishment, it will gradually thrive. This is the fundamental principle of qi and nourishment for the body.</p>
<p>The aspects of nurturing and harmonizing are language for governance, intended for people to align with the harmony of heaven and earth, following the appropriateness of the four seasons to nourish the spirit, qi, and body.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are beings with physical forms that are not subjected to the influences of the five movements of yin and yang; such a state is unheard of. Why is it that creation does not reach its limit and becomes the origin of all things’ generation and transformation? It is because it is the abode of the divine. However, the gathering and dispersing are unpredictable, and the processes of generation and transformation are infinite; it is not that the divine is incapable of operating! Therefore, the emergence of things is called transformation, and the culmination of things is called change. The unpredictable nature of yin and yang is referred to as the divine, and the application of the divine without limitation is called sagehood.</p>
<p>The &quot;Six Subtleties&quot; states: the emergence of things arises from transformation, while the culmination of things stems from change. The interaction between change and consistency is what leads to success or failure. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constants&quot; states: when qi begins, generation and transformation occur; when qi disperses, forms arise; when qi spreads, growth happens; when qi ends, forms transform. Yin and yang are the principles of heaven and earth. Within yin resides yang, and within yang resides yin; neither can be fully measured. Their influence operates through the four seasons, transforming all things, and cannot be subjected to quantification.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The governance of the five forms has its excesses and deficiencies. It is said that each of the five movements governs specific years; for instance, in the years dominated by Ren, the wood movement is excessive, while in the years of Ding, the wood movement is deficient. Similarly, in the years of Wu, the fire movement is excessive, while in the years of Gui, the fire movement is deficient. In the years of Jia, the earth movement is excessive, while in the years of Ji, the earth movement is deficient. In the years of Geng, the metal movement is excessive, while in the years of Yi, the metal movement is deficient. In the years of Bing, the water movement is excessive, while in the years of Xin, the water movement is deficient. Therefore, at the beginning, when there is excess, it proceeds; when there is deficiency, it follows after. When there is deficiency, it proceeds, and the excess follows.</p>
<p>Understanding how to respond and follow, one can make predictions regarding qi. The term &quot;beginning&quot; refers to the initiation of the heavenly stems from Jia and the earthly branches from Zi. For example, when the earth movement is excessive in a Jia year, the metal movement in the following Yi year will be deficient; when the lesser Yin is excessive in the Zi year, the greater Yin will be deficient in the Chou year. This is what is meant by &quot;excess leads forward, deficiency follows.&quot; Similarly, when the metal movement is deficient in the Yi year, the water movement in the following Bing year will be excessive; when the greater Yin is deficient in the Chou year, the lesser Yang will be excessive in the Yin year. This illustrates the principle of &quot;deficiency leads forward, excess follows.&quot;</p>
<p>By comprehending the cycles of annual movements, one can establish timing regarding excesses and deficiencies in qi. Responding to Heaven is like the heavenly symbols, adhering to each year is akin to the yearly principles, and the three harmonies lead to governance.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: How do the upper and lower realms call upon each other? Gui You Qu replied: The cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven, which are upheld by the three yin and three yang. The wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of the earth, which correspond to growth, transformation, and storage below.</p>
<p>[Note: The cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire are the six energies of heaven. Above the sun, cold energy presides; above the lesser yin, hot energy presides; above the yang brightness, dry energy presides; above the greater yin, humid energy presides; above the lesser yang, wind energy presides; and above the lesser yin, fire energy presides. Thus, the three yin and three yang uphold the six energies of heaven. The wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the five elements of the earth. In spring, wood governs growth; in summer, fire governs maturity; during the long summer, earth governs transformation; in autumn, metal governs harvest; and in winter, water governs storage. Therefore, growth, transformation, and storage respond below to these principles. The five energies of heaven operate on the five elements of the earth; the five elements of the earth present the six energies of heaven. Thus, the mutual calling between upper and lower realms is established, and the energies of the three yin and three yang belong to both heaven and earth. Therefore, it is said later: Heaven has yin and yang; the earth also has yin and yang.]</p>

<p>The qi of heaven refers to the essence of various colors and elements, which moves without end. The shift to the right every five years pertains to the transition from Jia to Yi, Yi to Bing, Bing to Ding, and Ding to Wu, marking the completion of the qi of the Five Movements, after which it restarts. The qi of earth refers to the essences of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.

In one year, there are 24 energies, summing to 720 energies for one cycle. A cycle signifies a small reunion.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are situations influenced by the five qi, which involve harmony, clarity, and the preparation for transformation, as discussed in the &quot;Suwen&quot; under the theory of qi exchanges and changes. It is important to consider the balance and tranquility of the seasons, where the five movements are harmonious, and there is no conflict with the six qi. In certain years, such as the Year of Bingzi and the Year of Bingwu, the fire movement governs the heavens while the water movement prevails; in the Years of Jiachen and Jiaxu, the water movement governs the heavens while the earth movement prevails. </p>
<p>Qi can either be influenced by the heavens or by the earth, with three cases where it is excessive and matches heavenly transformations, and three cases where it is insufficient yet matches. Similarly, there are three cases where it is excessive and matches earthly transformations, and three cases where it is insufficient and matches. All of these twenty-four years align with the heavenly influences and correspond with the earthly qi. If there is a reversal of the earthly qi or the heavenly qi, excluding the years designated by the heavenly symbols, it does not align with the qi that governs in the springs. </p>
<p>Whether qi is harmonious or not corresponds with the seasonal influences, such as the warming winds of spring, the heat of summer, the clear dew of autumn, the rainy periods of late summer, and the ice and snow of winter—these represent the guest qi matching the seasonal qi. If the governing qi is deficient and the guest qi prevails, this indicates a mismatch between the guest qi and seasonal qi. </p>
<p>The heavenly cycles conform to the earthly principles, facilitating harmony between upper and lower realms, without disruption of order, ensuring that the qi governing the heavens is consistently aligned. The rise and fall of heaven and earth maintain their appropriateness, with a rise followed by a fall and a fall followed by a rise; thus, the changes in heaven and earth proceed without losing their suitability.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Harmonizing its movement, adjusting its transformations, ensuring that the five movements operate smoothly, and not deviating from their governance: harmonize the energies of the five movements, manifest moral cultivation, and do not stray from orders of governance. The five movements and six energies, when harmonized with moral orders and authoritative regulations, must inevitably undergo transformations of excess and resurgence. Now, if one wishes for the energies to be peaceful, one must support and restrain them by means of the five flavors, hence it is said to adjust with the proper flavors. In heaven, it is called energy; on earth, it is called flavor; flavors are used to adjust energies. Those who go along with what is beneficial should take the supportive path, while those who restrain should take the opposite path.</p>
<p>Qi Bo bowed deeply and replied: What a profound question! This is the fundamental principle of heaven and earth, the source of transformations. Who among the sages can exhaust its ultimate principles? Although I am dull, I respectfully present my understanding, so that it may endure and remain unchanged over time.</p>
<p>The five movements and yin-yang represent the way of heaven and earth, the framework of all things, the parents of transformations, the origin of life and death, and the abode of the divine. If a person can adjust their energies and movements, they will secure everlasting fulfillment without the fear of extinction, allowing for permanence without the disaster of change.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish for you to expound further, to categorize and order them, to divide their main elements, to distinguish their essential authorities, to reveal their energetic patterns, and to clarify their governance and transformation.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a></p></div>

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the numbers of their movements; cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire, the transformations they govern. Then the way of heaven can be seen, and the spirit of the people can be adjusted. The fluctuations of yin and yang are clear, and there is no confusion nearby. What can be counted, please allow me to continue speaking about it.</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Classes&quot; refers to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. The Heavenly Stems begin with Jia, and the Earthly Branches begin with Zi, each having its own order; establishing the year first is what this refers to. The &quot;Chiefs&quot; of the divisions refer to the influence of the wind on the upper Yin, and the heat on the upper Lesser Yin. The six atmospheric influences correspond to the six divisions, each governing the year and the seasons. The &quot;lineage&quot; refers to the five movements and five phases as the rulers of the vital energies. The &quot;proper transformations&quot; refer to transformations of heat, cold, rain, and wind, which illustrate the nature being clarified. The &quot;numbers of movements&quot; indicate how the five movements succeed each other, all of which are managed, returning to their cycle in the end. The &quot;transformation they govern&quot; means that the six energies oversee those above, govern those below the spring, take charge of the seasonal energies, and additionally oversee guest energies. By clarifying the numbers of their nature, the way of heaven can be seen, the spirit of the people can be adjusted, the fluctuations of yin and yang can be clarified, and confusion dissipated.]</p>

[Note: This section discusses the transformation and movement of Great Horn. The next section begins to discuss the Director of Heaven at the Spring and the six Qi during the intervening atmosphere. Ren signifies the yang year; the year of excessive wood thus points to Great Horn. The sounds and vibrations, as well as the proliferation, are signs of flourishing. Splitting occurs when wood sprouts and opens. The excessive wind wood thus causes shaking, pulling, and lifting. Dizziness and loss of sight are all illnesses caused by wind wood. Ni Zhongxuan states: The five movements correspond internally to the five organs, and the illness is in the liver, which is why symptoms appear in the eyes. The following five movements follow this pattern.]</p>

Sound indicates the differentiation between winter and summer, divided by the zi and wu. Yin and yang are distinguished, while cold and heat contest. Thus, the five sounds govern the two solstices related to zi and wu, and the two divisions related to mao and you, with the central position being the soil, ruling over the four seasons. Therefore, the five sounds align with the transformations and movements of the five elements.]</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Notes: The excessive manifestation of the fire element (戊癸化火) indicates an overly powerful year of fire, hence the term &quot;Tai Zheng&quot; (太征). When the fire element is too strong, and cold water rises above it, fire is able to maintain its control, thus its brilliance is balanced, avoiding the harmful effects of excessive heat. This aligns with the year of &quot;Zheng Zheng&quot; (正征), in which the fire element is present in the noon position, leading to a harmonious gathering of energies. The heat represents the fire element&#39;s nature, characterized by warmth and oppressive heat, reflecting its transformation. Due to the excessive fire energy, its changes become fierce and turbulent. An excess of heat further translates into the affliction of heat-related illnesses. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cold and damp energy lingers in the atmosphere. When the people suffer from cold dampness, their muscles wither, their legs weaken and cannot retract, and they experience moist diarrhea and excessive bleeding. </p>
<p>(Note: This section discusses the overarching principles of the six energies related to seasonal and temporal changes. The yearly energy relates to the heavenly authority at the springs, while the seasonal energy pertains to the interplay of guest and host energies. Although the six energies each have their divisions, the heavenly energy is regarded as the main energy of the year; hence this is referred to as the administration of the sun in controlling heavenly matters and energies moving in accordance with nature. The years governed by the celestial branches of the rat, horse, tiger, and earth are associated with excessive energy, while those of the ox, goat, rabbit, rooster, snake, and pig are linked to insufficient energy. Energies that dominate in years characterized as excessive arrive earlier in the natural order, while those in insufficient years arrive later. Thus, it is said that &quot;excessive movement&quot; arrives early, while &quot;insufficient movement&quot; arrives late. The sun&#39;s cold water governs the heavens, thus the atmosphere is restrained; the moon&#39;s damp earth is at the springs, thus the land&#39;s energy is tranquil. Cold in the vast void prevents the yang energy from manifesting its governance; the combination of water and earth reflects the alignment with the stars of the hours and the stabilizing stars. The grains governed by the original mellow energy ripen, responding to the energy at the heavenly springs, which is referred to as the seasonal grains. Restraint is the governance of the heavens, while gradual emergence is the command of the earth. The marsh without the sun’s flame indicates the emergence of yang within the yin, subdued by cold water; these two energies signify the lesser yin and its ruling energy. Due to the strong governance of cold, it must wait for the appropriate time before emerging. The concept of &quot;waiting for the times&quot; indicates the arrival through the five energies, as the lesser yin&#39;s intermediate energy commands before it emerges. This describes the governing energies of the four seasons, which are ultimately superseded by those of the heavens.)<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As spring begins and warmth increases, the people suffer from severe illnesses. Heat-related ailments emerge, causing fever, headaches, vomiting, and sores. </p>
<p>In the second phase, a great chill returns, leading to despair among the people. The grasses encounter cold, the fire element is consequently suppressed, and the people become afflicted by stagnant internal energy filled with heat. The cold now begins.</p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;second phase&quot; refers to when the yangming metal energy arrives, causing the return of great chill and transforming the excessive heat into coolness before mid-year; hence, it is termed a return. The despair of the people is due to the cold energy present during this transitional phase. Grasses suffering from cold indicate that the chill lies below. With cold prevailing below, the fire energy from above begins to be suppressed. It is said that the atmospheric energy from heaven all arises from below. The stagnation of internal energy implies that the yang energy is constrained within. The cold now beginning refers to the cold energy from heaven, which starts with the second phase. This heavenly energy is further overcome by the intervening energies.)</p>
<p>In the third phase, the heavenly order is established, allowing cold energy to circulate, bringing rain, which results in the people suffering from cold and retroverted heat internally. The presence of boils and abscesses occurs, leading to heart heat and confusion; those untreated may die.</p>
<p>(Note: The chilling water energy from heaven arrives during the third phase, hence the establishment of heavenly order while cold energy flows and rain falls. In summer, when heat should prevail, the arrival of cold energy leads to the people suffering from internal heat that is instead cold. The presence of boils and confusion is indicative of fire stagnation; if untreated, it may lead to self-destruction.)</p>
<p>In the fourth phase, wind and moisture clash, causing the wind to transform into rain, which nurtures growth and results in maturation. The people suffer from great heat and diminished vitality, experiencing muscle atrophy, leg weakness, and loss of bodily fluids, manifesting as red and white discharges.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The note describes the addition of the Qi of Wind and Wood from the Yin aspect, where the dominant Qi of the Earth is the Moist Earth of the Taiyin, leading to a struggle between Wind and Moisture. When Wind transforms into Rain, it is due to the added Qi that changes with the time. At the transition from summer to autumn, the Moist Earth is the dominant Qi, which fosters growth and transformation—summer promotes growth and autumn promotes completion, while the long summer facilitates transformation. The ailments arising from excessive heat and lack of Qi are attributed to Wind and Heat disorders. Conditions of flesh weakness and limb atrophy are due to the Qi of Moist Earth.

The primary energy of the five elements is linked to the dryness of metal, so it comes to fruition. The fire that is trapped releases it, enabling the people to relax.</p>
<p>The energy at the end is correct for the earth, and moisture allows for movement; the yin condenses in the vast emptiness, dust darkens the countryside, and the people are in sorrow and despair as the cold wind arrives. When the reversing force gives birth, it leads to death.</p>
<p>The energy of the spring, pertaining to the terminal energy, makes the earth&#39;s energy correct and moisture allows for action. The yin condensing in the vast emptiness refers to the movement of the great yin energy above. The dust darkening the countryside is the transformation of the moist soil spread below. The sorrowful condition of the people is due to the moisture and yin energy acting within them. The earth is responsible for nurturing earthworms, while humanity is linked to the abundance of these earthworms.

<p>It is essential to dispel stagnant energy and first support its source of transformation.<br>[Note: The source of transformation refers to the five movements that generate the six energies. To dispel stagnant energy means to alleviate the energies causing stagnation. For example, in the year governed by Tai Zheng, when the sun rules the heavens, the fire movement becomes stagnant; in the year of Tai Yu, when the yin is at its peak, the water movement becomes stagnant. Therefore, it is necessary to dry out to counteract the earth energy of Tai Yin and warm up to mitigate the cold evil of Tai Yang. The six energies are equivalent.]</p>

For instance, in the year of Tai Jiao, if the wind wood is overwhelmingly strong, the earth will be controlled by it. Thus, one should suppress the strength of wind wood and support the weakness of earth. Similarly, in the year of Tai Zheng, if the fire movement is too strong, the metal energy will be controlled. Therefore, one should moderate the excess of fire and support the weakness of metal. This is what is meant by harmonizing the movement, adjusting its transformation, and preventing excesses that could lead to illness among the people.]<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a></p></div>

<p>(The note explains that the year&#39;s grains refer to the original grains cultivated in harmony with the heavenly energies, and consuming them allows one to absorb the essence of heaven and earth. False evils refer to the negative influences that overpower the vital energies in their midst. For instance, in the year governed by the sun, the initial energy is the lesser yang fire, but if cold overcomes it, that is the cold evil overpowering its initial energy; the second energy is the dry metal of yang brightness, but if heat overcomes it, that is the heat evil overpowering its second energy; the fourth energy is the wind wood of the exhaustive yin, but if dryness overcomes it, that is the drying evil overpowering its fourth energy; the fifth energy is the lesser yin fire lord, but if cold overcomes it, that is the heat evil overpowering its fifth energy.

Thus, it is said to consume the grains in between to avoid false evils; when the evils are eliminated, the true nature will stabilize.)</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This text discusses the theory of the five types of qi (vital energy) and their relation to the celestial phenomena and natural water sources, highlighting the similarities and differences in their qualities. The quantity and nature of qi must be adjusted according to these peculiarities. </p>
<p>When dealing with similar cold and damp conditions, represented by Taiyu and Taigong, which correspond with the cold dampness of the celestial phenomena, one should use more drying and warming flavors to counteract them. This is because dryness will control dampness, and heat will transform coldness. </p>
<p>In contrast, when addressing the conditions governed by Taizheng, Taijiao, and Taishang, which possess distinct properties from cold dampness, one should use fewer drying and damp contents for correction. This is due to the necessity of using dampness to nourish the drying and warming energies while using dryness to regulate the harmful aspects of wood and wind. </p>
<p>In instances of similarity, the energy is abundant, thus it is advisable to increase it; in cases of difference, the energy is isolated, thus it should be reduced. </p>
<p>One should use cold to counteract extreme cold, cool to ease excessive coolness, warm to mitigate extreme warmth, and hot to neutralize excessive heat. Dietary practices should align with these principles. If one deviates from these norms, it will lead to illness, which is referred to as &quot;timely action.&quot; </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as the sun governs the heavens, it is necessary to use heat to warm. When the spring energy is characterized by lesser yang fire, one should avoid this heat of lesser yang before applying warmth. When lesser yin is at the spring, cold should be used to cleanse it, while the seasonal energy reflects the cold water of the greater yang. In such cases, one must avoid this cold of greater yang before using cold. Warmth and coolness share the same meaning, and herbs and food follow the same method; this is what is meant by timing and the six positions. If there is something false, it contradicts the norm, which is to say that harmful energy overcomes, and it is not necessary to avoid cold while avoiding heat. When the greater yang cold water governs the heavens, and the spring energy reflects lesser yang fire, if the weather is cold, it is necessary to use heat, and there is no need to avoid heat. When lesser yin fire is at the spring, and the seasonal energy reflects the greater yang cold water, if the weather is warm, it is necessary to use cold, and there is no need to avoid cold. This is what is meant by the weather contradicting the season, and one can rely on the timing. Those who go against this cause ailments among the people, which is the so-called seasonal affliction.

In the year governed by the Taiyin, the sun is in the spring, and water is enhanced and flourishing. In the year governed by Jueyin, the energy of wood rises, and earth is restrained by wood. The year of Xinyou is one where metal and water nourish each other; thus, it is primarily noted in the Xinmao year.</p>
<p>All five tones have their insufficiencies, yet only the Palace tone is mentioned because it is situated centrally among the elements and is influenced by the four seasons. Therefore, it is said that the energy of the five movements is rooted in the center and operates outward. Rooted in the center denotes the earth of the Central Palace, transforming and influencing in all directions. Cold represents energy in motion, rain signifies winning energy, and wind indicates recuperative energy; hence, the movement encompasses cold, rain, and wind.</p>
<p>Regarding the &quot;Minor Feather&quot; and &quot;Minor Horn,&quot; they represent the energy of the year&#39;s ruling. The &quot;Minor&quot; during the year begins with the Horn and concludes with the Feather. The Horn represents the beginning, and the Feather denotes the end, concerning the energies of time. Minor and Major both commence with the Horn and finish with the Feather, with the latter four seasons conforming to this.</p>
<p>All of this represents the administration of the Yangming in the realm of heaven, with energy transformations occurring in the latter days. The year governed by Mao and You indicates that the annual energy is insufficient, as all celestial governance in spring references temporal energies that arrive later. The heavenly energy is urgent, and the earthly energy is clear.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yangming governs the heavens, thus the Shaoyin is at the springs. The metal command is above, hence the weather is vigorous; the ruling fire is below, hence the earth&#39;s energy is bright. When Yang exclusively exerts its command, the heat of summer prevails, and things become dry and firm. </p>
<p>With Yangming above and ruling fire below, Yang’s heat is intense, causing things to dry and harden. The pure wind then governs, and the dry winds circulate. This flow of energy is characterized by more Yang and less Yin. Clouds approach the rain office, and moisture spreads. When dryness is extreme, there are marshes. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the season, the energy is that of the Jueyin wind and wood. In years of excess, the guest energy is strong and often dominates; in years of deficiency, the guest energy is weak but still responds to the ruling energy. Therefore, the pure wind governs, reflecting the transformation of the initial energy of wind and wood. Yangming, representative of dry metal, governs the heavens, while Jueyin, associated with wind and wood, symbolizes the ruling energy. Hence, dry winds circulate and flow through the interchange of energies. </p>
<p>The interaction of ruling and guest energies refers to their intertwining dynamics. The intersection of energies occurs before the midpoint of the year, and their interaction is completed thereafter. The dual energies of ruling and guest are the two ruling fires, while the principal energies of the three are Yangming and Shaoyang, thus resulting in more Yang and less Yin. The clouds approaching the rain office signify the moisture of the earth, which, when vaporized, becomes clouds, and when the weather cools, it falls as rain. The energy of the four is under the influence of the Taiyin representing moist earth, while the Taiyang embodies cold water, leading to the phrase &quot;clouds approach the rain office, and moisture spreads.&quot; The governing dry metal fulfills its role in the triple energies, interacting with the cold water and moist earth of the four energies, thereby leading to dryness becoming extreme and marshes forming. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This text discusses five types of insects that are influenced by the celestial atmosphere and have limited reproduction. The terms &quot;white,&quot; &quot;armor,&quot; and &quot;variety&quot; refer to insects that respond to the celestial essence, which are merely decorative in nature and have little capacity for reproduction, unlike those that thrive during abundant times. In a year influenced by metal, all types of protective insects, described as the 360 kinds of protective insects, are born from the metal influence. However, only the white and armored ones reproduce under the celestial metal influence, while others do not.</p>
<p>When metal and fire combine harmoniously, it corresponds to the bright star and the wandering star. The governance is strict and the orders severe. Hibernating insects come to light and flowing water does not freeze. The people suffer from coughs, blockages in the throat, chills and fevers, shivering, and urinary retention.</p>
<p>The harmony of metal and fire above relates to the governance of brightness and clarity (represented by metal) and urgency and severity (represented by fire). When the force of fire is present in the spring, hibernating insects do not hide, and flowing water remains unfrozen. The ailments suffered by the people, such as throat blockages and shivering, arise from the influence of dry heat.</p>
<p>When clarity precedes vigor, woolly insects die. When heat follows and becomes severe, armored insects face disaster. This means that when the celestial energy is strong before the mid-year, it affects the outcome, while heat that intensifies later causes issues, with the insects succumbing to the dominance of the celestial influence in the spring and ultimately perishing.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a></p></div>

It explains that when the two flames representing the sovereign and minister harmonize, the yang energy can spread, resulting in the people thriving. Conversely, when the harsh conditions intensify, it can lead to violent deaths, indicating a disbalance between the roles of power.</p>
<p>In a scenario where the three energies represent the heavenly governance, coolness prevails, and there is a convergence of dryness and heat, resulting in illness among the populace characterized by cold and heat disturbances. This is attributed to the influence of metal energy from the heavens, which causes the governance to distribute while cooling occurs.</p>

<p>The presence of the fourth phase relates to the interaction of cold water and the governing energy from the damp earth, which brings about cold rain. As the season progresses, lesser yin energy invokes further cold and dampness, exacerbating health issues. Symptoms manifest due to cold external conditions and internal heat stagnation. The text notes that various ailments such as cold-related shivering and heart pain arise when external cold interplays with internal fire, resulting in complications.

Conversely, to disrupt the established order of heaven and earth and disturb the pathways of yin and yang is detrimental.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! What about the governance of the lesser yang? Qi Bo replied: It pertains to the timing of yin and yang. Lesser yang correlates with the very beginning of the cycle, with the fiery element of the lesser yin influencing the latter times. Its movement is like the winds blowing, its transformation creates disruption, its changes lead to pulling and collapsing, and its ailments include dizziness, tension in the limbs, and fright.</p>
<p>(Note: The water element dominates when wood is excessive; during the yin and yang cycles, the lesser yang governs the heavens, while the lesser yin is stationed by the spring, sharing energy akin to that of the sun and the fiery element, but manifesting differently. Wood and earth combine in ailments of the blood; wood and fire bring about ailments of the energy. Dizziness and fright, as the classics say, relate to the liver. The east corresponds to the liver wood, its ailments causing fright.)</p>
<p>At the very beginning, the lesser governance calls for a lesser tribute, a great womb, and lesser commerce, culminating in a great feather. The lesser yang then progresses through its final forms in lesser tribute, lesser commerce, and heavenly signs of earth, sustaining summer’s heat, with transformations causing heat and strife. Its changes are of intense inflammation and boiling, leading to ailments of extreme heat, congested blood, bleeding, diarrhea, and heart pain.</p>
<p>(Note: The earth element signifies excessive fire. In the year with the fire element, one observes the lesser yang, as the heavens align with it; thus, the &quot;Celestial Records&quot; states that the heavenly symbol erupts in intense flames, reaching its peak. Ailments from heat arise precisely because the fire element is greatly influencing the lesser yang.)<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the year of Yin and Shen, the Earth’s energies are abundant, and the six atmospheric energies arrive according to the seasonal cycles. The essence of blue, dull red, and pure white originates and evolves into the five elements of the Earth; the five elements of the Earth present themselves as the six atmospheric energies from above. Thus, it is said that cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven, with three yin and three yang presented from below. Therefore, the three yin and three yang are below, while the six energies are above. Thus, above the Lesser Yang, the fire energy governs, while the Severe Yin is seen within; above the Severe Yin, the wind energy governs, while the Lesser Yang is visible within. When the heavenly energy is correct, it is said that the Lesser Yang directs the heavens, and the energy transforms within the interactions of energies. Given that the three yin and three yang are below, even though they govern the heavens, the energies descend and circulate within. The sun’s shadow is in the spring, hence the Earth’s energy is disturbed. The subsequent text states that where the Severe Yin arrives, it brings disturbance and response, following its constant course.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the sage encounters this period, they harmonize the cold and heat, preventing external and internal conflicts from arising. If external and internal forces clash, it leads to maladies of cold and heat, such as diarrhea, deafness, dizziness, and vomiting, where the energy of wind and heat prevails within. Swellings and color changes signify that cold and dampness dominate from without.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, the energy of the earth moves, the wind prevails and shakes, the cold departs, and the season turns warm. Vegetation flourishes early; the cold does not kill, and thus warmth-related illnesses arise. Symptoms of illness include upward blockage, blood overflowing leading to red eyes, coughing with reverse flow, headaches, blood loss, fullness in the sides, and skin sores.</p>
<p>In this initial period, the energy aligns with the Lesser Yin&#39;s fire, while the governing energy corresponds with the Severe Yin&#39;s wind and wood; hence the wind stirs and the temperature rises, allowing plants to absorb the life-giving energy early. The Lesser Yang governs the heavens, paired with the fire of the ruler, which means that despite the arrival of seasonal cold, it does not kill, due to the warmth of both fires. Symptoms like blood overflow, red eyes, coughing, and skin sores showcase the afflictions caused by wind and fire.</p>
<p>In the second phase, fire reacts with pent-up energy, white dust rises everywhere, clouds gather, and rain is anticipated. If the wind cannot overcome the moisture, the rain falls, and the people find relief.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The addition of timely cold air corresponds to the clear and cool energy of Yangming, hence the arrival of coolness and the descent of white dew.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of the Earth, when it is upright, reveals the transformation of Shaoyang from within. All things encounter the vital energy and begin to thrive; the Earth’s energy then rises up. During times of frost and mist, it acts and conceals, thus commanding the process of emergence. Therefore, those who suffer from blockages and heart pain have kidney energy ascending to the heart. The lungs govern Qi, while the kidneys are the source of vitality; thus, the kidneys are foundational, and the lungs are secondary. Yang energy, in winter, returns to the kidneys, but if it instead ascends to the lungs, it leads to cough.</p>
<p>In cases of excessive energy, one must suppress it. It is essential to break the stagnation and first address the source of transformation. Intense excess does not bring forth life, and harsh illnesses do not arise.</p>
<p>When the energy is too much, it must be suppressed. What cannot withstand it, like during the Ren year when the wood energy is excessive, leads to the Earth energy being overwhelmed; in the Wu year, when the fire energy is excessive, the metal energy becomes overwhelmed. Therefore, it is appropriate to suppress the overabundance and support what cannot be overwhelmed. Breaking the stagnant energy occurs, for example, in the Geng Yin and Geng Shen years, when Shaoyang governs the heavens, thus the commerce energy suffers stagnation; in the Jia Yin and Jia Shen years, where Jueyin resides in the spring, the palace energy suffers stagnation.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To address the excess of stagnant energy, one should first draw from the source of the Five Movements, moderating its extremes and supporting its insufficiency. Hence, excessive conditions do not arise, and harsh ailments do not emerge. The term &quot;excessive&quot; refers to the energy of the Tai Gong and Tai Shang, which governs excess and in turn experiences stagnation, resulting in its severity. Extreme excess is called &quot;harsh&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a year, one should favor salty,辛, and sour elements to mitigate the detrimental effects of the environment. </p>
<p>Salty is appropriate to control the fire of the lesser yang, and辛 helps to overcome the evil of the wind and wood. The Jue Yin follows the transformation of the lesser yang fire, thus it drains the mother’s energy, making the use of sour necessary for replenishment. The term &quot;soak&quot; refers to the ancient practice of using liquids to extract sweat. &quot;Seep&quot; refers to draining in order to clear the internal heat; &quot;soak&quot; is for dispersing external wind evils.</p>
<p>Observe the cold and warm air to adjust the excess. Similar winds with heat tend to undergo more cold transformation, while dissimilar wind heats experience less cold transformation. </p>
<p>The cold and warm refer to the temperatures of the Five Movements. In years of Tai Jiao or Tai Zheng, when the atmospheric conditions resonate with the wind and heat at the springs, one often uses cooler elements for cleansing. In the years of Tai Gong, Tai Shang, and Tai Yu, when the energies differ from those at the springs, less cooling is needed.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fire’s emergence is akin to the flourishing of vegetation; mountains and rivers covered in ice and snow represent this.

<p>Thus, when there is an abundance, it is appropriate to rise; when there is deficiency, it is suitable to descend. The benefit of the earth lies in the transformation of its energy, which the populace adapts to, thereby influencing their fate. </p>
<p>This refers to the varying elevations and thickness of the soils in the five regions. Therefore, when seasonal energy is abundant, the soil should be high and thick; when the seasonal energy is lacking, the soil should be low and thin. An excess of energy should be moderated, while a deficiency should be prioritized. High and thick soil allows energy to be more gradual in emergence; lower soil permits easier ascension of energy. When energy is abundant, it should arrive more slowly; when deficient, it should arrive more quickly.

The cold wind morning and evening, steam and heat suppress one another; plants and trees are shrouded in mist, dampness condenses without flowing, resulting in white dew and signaling the arrival of autumn.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energy of the fourth phase is governed by the Great Yin, which represents moist and loamy earth. When dampness and heat combine, it creates a steamy vapor that rises from the earth. The damp and cold energy does not integrate well with fire energy, causing a blockage in the weather&#39;s flow. As a result, dampness does not descend; instead, the white dew appears, signaling the arrival of autumn. The cold wind represents the frigid energy of the sun and water. The people suffer from fullness and other related ailments, which arise from the mingling of cold, damp, and heat energies, manifesting as illness.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When affected by the cold, a person experiences joint stiffness and lumbar pain; the cold and dampness invade the interaction of the qi, leading to illness. The root cause is the coldness of the water, which is why the cold is severe. The interaction between the cold and damp qi, both above and below, causes great transformation of dampness. Frost accumulates and solidifies, transforming the dampness; ice grows rigid and suppresses the yang, enforcing the cold. The kidneys store during winter and govern the bones; hence, the joints become stiff and the movements of the bones are restricted. The lumbar region pertains to the kidneys. The cold and damp hold the qi in intersection, which refers to the balance of the qi between heaven and earth; people become ill within this interaction of qi.</p>

This is because the ruling fire is above while the coldness is below; when the cold energy oppresses the heart, it results in heart pain, and this causes further fluctuations between cold and heat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the harmonization of the elements of Yin and Yang, specifically focusing on the interaction between the lesser Yang (少阳) and the extreme Yin (厥阴). It states that when the lesser Yang governs the skies, the atmospheric conditions are correct, and when it is in the springs, the earth’s energy is also proper. It suggests that the energy of extreme Yin is aligned with the operation of lesser Yang, and vice versa. </p>
<p>Consequently, the winds rise high and far, bringing along warmth. Clouds gather to deliver rain, and moisture moves along with it. Wind and fire operate in harmony, responding to the guiding stars above. Political actions may be disrupted, edicts may be issued rapidly, and the grain is a mix of colors indicating its state. There are losses in culture and refinement. Winds bring dryness and heat, which further exacerbate conditions. Hibernating insects emerge, and flowing water does not freeze. Heat-related illnesses arise below, while wind-related ailments occur above, with the dry winds influencing conditions in between.</p>
<p>The passage notes that the nature of wind is to sway, leading to disturbed atmospheric conditions, while the lesser Yang energy operates centrally, thus ensuring the earth&#39;s energy remains properly aligned. The presence of wind in the skies causes it to rise high. When lesser Yang energy unites with extreme Yin, warmth follows suit. Clouds and rain occur because of the dominance of wind and fire. The convergence of these forces is described as harmony, responding to the brightness of certain celestial bodies. Political disruptions are attributed to winds, while the rapidity of actions stems from the influence of fire. The mixed grains indicate the first influence of the energy from the heavens at the springs, leading to ripening.<a id="trans-254p" href="#orig-254p" class="marker">[254p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The term &quot;Jian Gu&quot; refers to the influences coming from the left, which is associated with the lesser yin, and the right, associated with the greater yang, where the energies of both sides converge. The ornamental horns of various creatures are born from the vitality of the heavens in the springs, but they are simply a manifestation of the nourishing essence, while the feathered beings cannot multiply and instead dissipate. The transformation following this leads to intense heat emanating from above, which compounds with the energies where they intersect. When hibernating insects emerge, water flows without freezing, indicating the presence of fire in the springs. When the wind energy is felt, illness arises from above; and when heat energy is felt, illness manifests below. If the wind and dryness exacerbate one another, the form becomes evident in the intersection of energies. In my humble opinion, the movements occurring above and below, referred to as manifestations in the middle, do not simply denote illness; they indicate the operations of wind and fire energies traveling up and down, intersecting in the center.

<p>The source of transformation refers to the five movements, which are the origins of the six energies.

Therefore, one should alleviate the energy causing stagnation to nourish the transformation from the five movements. The six energies are fundamentally similar. When the yearly movement is insufficient, one must support the flow of vital energy to prevent those evils from prevailing over the insufficient energies.

What is called &quot;not a transformation of energy&quot; refers to a state not influenced by the energy of the cycles.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: &quot;If I oversee this, then act accordingly; if it does not match the numbers, why is that?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The use of qi varies in quantity, and transformation has its rise and fall. The rise and fall correspond to transformation.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to understand this correspondence in transformation; how is it?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The warmth of spring transforms with the wind, the heat of summer aligns with dusk and the blaze of fire, and the victories and returns correspond. The dryness and clarity of autumn transforms with smoke and haze, while clouds and rain correspond with dusk and the lingering dust of late summer. The coldness with frost, snow, and ice transforms with winter. These variations of the five movements and six qi are governed by constants of rise and fall.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Not matching the numbers&quot; refers to not aligning with the six qi. &quot;The use of qi varies in quantity&quot; indicates that the application of the six qi can be excessive or insufficient. &quot;Transformation has its rise and fall&quot; signifies that the five movements&#39; transformations can be too much or too little. &quot;Wind, heat, and dryness&quot; refer to the six qi of yin and yang. &quot;Spring, summer, autumn, and winter&quot; correlate with the musical notes of jiao, zheng, gong, shang, and yu, which govern both the year and time. &quot;The warmth of spring transforming with the wind&quot; refers to the union of jueyin and the jiao movement. &quot;The heat of summer transforming with dusk&quot; relates to the union of shaoyin and shao yang with the zheng movement. &quot;Victories and returns&quot; correspond to the five movements of victory and return, which also relate to the six qi. For instance, the clear metal overcomes the wood of jiao; this overcoming qi aligns with yangming; the blazing fire returns over the autumn metal, and this returning qi aligns with shaoyin and shao yang. This is why there may be discrepancies: if the abundance of warm wind corresponds too closely to the flourishing of spring, then the qi movement aligns with its transformation. Conversely, if the six qi insufficiently matches the abundance of the five movements, and the decline of the five movements corresponds with the abundance of the six qi, then this rise and fall is in disharmony.)<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One must not fail to respect and fear these (concepts) while keeping a distance. This is referred to as the six positions that arise in a year. </p>
<p>(Note: This passage generally states that within a year, there are six positions that respond to the seasons, each governing sixty days and eighty-seven and a half beats, each associated with four seasonal temperatures: cold, hot, warm, and cool. It is advisable to keep your distance and not interfere with them. For instance, in the initial phase, when the weather is still cold, it is appropriate to use warmth. During this time, the lesser yang is in charge, so one should avoid this position and not interfere. In the second phase, as the weather becomes warm, it is appropriate to use coolness; in this case, the greater yang governs, so again, one should avoid this position and utilize cooling instead. This applies to all six seasonal energies each year. Following the proper flow leads to harmony, while acting against it causes illness; one must respect and fear these energies and keep a distance.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about warmth and coolness? Qi Bo replied: If the energy is governed by heat, then use warmth without interference; if governed by cold, use coolness without interference. If governed by coolness, use coolness without interference; if governed by warmth, use warmth without interference. When energies are the same as their rulers, one should not interfere; when they differ, minor interference is allowed. This is known as the four fears, and one must be careful to observe them.</p>
<p>(Note: This discussion concerns the governance of heavenly energies in relation to the groundwater and the concept of non-interference.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Like the sun illuminating a spring, one governs the energies with coolness and employs the cool. One should keep a distance from this cooling of the sun and not transgress it. The same applies to all other energies. If the intervening energy matches the governing energy of the heavens in the spring, it must not be transgressed; if it differs, then a minor transgression is permitted. For instance, if the lesser yang governs the heavens and the initial energy is the lesser yin fire, then it corresponds with the energy of the heavens and one must not transgress its heat. However, if the lesser yin is in the spring with the four energies, and the greater yang is cold water, this differs from the governing energy, allowing a slight use of heat and a minor transgression. This is called the four apprehensions of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, which must be carefully considered. </p>
<p>The Emperor said: Good! What about transgressors? Qi Bo replied: When the energies of the heavens oppose the seasonal timing, one may adhere to the season. Wang Bing commented that severe opposition is a sickness that can then follow the timing. In cases where one overcomes the main energy, a transgression is permitted. Balance is the benchmark, and one must not exceed it. This is termed the situation where the evil energy opposes and overcomes. </p>
<p>Note: When the energies of the heavens oppose the seasonal timing, such as when heat is governed but the heavenly energy opposes with coolness, one should adhere to the timing and employ warmth. If heat is governed while cold overcomes, one can use heat and transgress the governing heat.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The passage discusses the importance of maintaining balance with the natural energies and warns against excessive use that harms the original true essence of vitality. It cautions that if malevolent energies overwhelm, one can fall into danger. Therefore, it is advised to avoid losing trust in heavenly signs, to not oppose appropriate energies, to refrain from supporting harmful influences, and to not encourage negative cycles. This is termed the ultimate governance.</p>
<p>The &quot;heavenly sign&quot; refers to qi arriving at the right time without deviation that leads to wrongful actions. Each of the six energies has its proper conditions and should not be opposed. If there are prevailing energies, they should be restrained rather than supported. Likewise, if there are recovering energies, they should be suppressed instead of encouraged. Achieving harmony in the right essence ensures that above and below align with virtue, preventing disruption of order. When the five movements and energies are in balance, it is said to be the ultimate governance.</p>
<p>The Emperor then asks if the circulation of the five energies and their relation to the annual cycles has fixed constants. Qi Bo responds that he wishes to elaborate on this further.</p>
<p>This aligns with the previous section, which begins with the sun and arranges the six energies of the three yangs and three yins, as well as beginning with the angle movements and sequence of the five tones, noting that years do not always align evenly. Thus, starting with the heavenly stems at Jia and the earthly branches at Zi, each cycle completes after thirty years with Jia Zi to Gui Si; and again from Jia Wu to Gui Hai, completing a full cycle after sixty years.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Gengchen and Gengxu years are noted. Geng signifies excessive influence, thus its number is complete. This is referred to as the Day of Proper Transformation.</p>
<p>Humidity transforms to five, clarity to four, and coldness to six, all of which govern proper transformation without the邪气 of overwhelming return. The qi of the five movements further divides into the seventy-two days. The qi of the heavens, governed by the spring, presides over sixty days with exceptions. Thus, its transformation includes bitter heat above, sour harmony in the middle, and sweet heat below. This is what is meant by the appropriateness of medicine and food.</p>
<p>The metal qi signifies collection, hence the appropriateness of sour to aid in that collection. Harmony refers to the qi of the five movements; each governs a year, yet within a year, there are the five movements of generation, growth, transformation, collection, and storage, thus necessitating harmonizing with the five tastes. Sweet, representing the earth taste, can control and transform cold water.</p>
<p>In the year of Bingyin and Bingshen, the upper portion aligns with the lesser yang fire, the middle portion with the great feather water movement, and the lower portion with the Jueyin wood. Fire dominates above, and water controls it, thus signifying a lack of impact.</p>
<p>Coldness transforms to six. The movements are excessive, hence their numbers are complete. The remaining excessive movements align similarly. </p>
<p>Wind transforms to three, corresponding to the years of Xinsi and Xinhai. Sihai does not have sufficient influence, hence its numbers arise. This, again, is referred to as the Day of Proper Transformation. Above, it transforms to salty coldness; in the middle, to mild salinity; and below, to warm salinity. This is the appropriateness of medicine and food.</p>
<p>The water movement signifies salinity and assists with salinity. Subsequent transformations often utilize harmony for assistance. Taste is meant to alleviate stagnant qi and foster sources of transformation.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a></p></div>

<p>&quot;At first, the vital energy is subtle, hence it is associated with deficiency; once it has matured, its quantity is abundant, hence it indicates excess.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energies of heaven and earth originate from the Five and culminate in the Nine; this is the significance of the numbers in the &quot;Lo Shu.&quot; Therefore, it is said: Between heaven and earth, there is nothing beyond the Five, and humanity should respond accordingly.</p>
<p>The ruler asked: What are the manifestations? Qi Bo replied: The soil is dense, the rocks and valleys tremble, thunder brings its energy together, dust dims the air, yellow and black transform into white vapor, swirling and rising high and deep, striking stones and flying into the sky; floods then arise, rivers spread broadly, and the fields and pastures become muddied. Transformations of air are therefore pervasive, bringing timely rain, marking the beginning of life, growth, change, and completion. Thus, when the people suffer from abdominal distension, with gurgling intestines, they count the following signs. If it worsens, they may experience heart pain and side aches, vomiting, chaotic digestion, and swellings that weigh the body down. Clouds rush, rains gather, and mists embrace the morning sun, while mountains and marshes are dimmed by dust. These occurrences arise from the Four energies; clouds cross the sky, ephemeral beings live and die, signaling premonitions.</p>
<p>[Note: The manifestations of the Five energies encompass changes in heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers; signs from plants, insects, and animals; calamities faced by the people; and shifts in cold and heat. Observing these manifestations allows one to understand their reciprocation. Thunder signifies the energy of fire, governed by the Third energy, while the Fourth energy governs earth; thus, the booming of thunder arises from the convergence of these energies beneath the earth, where fire and soil unite. White signifies the energy of metal, where earth expands and metal transforms. High and deep refer to the spaces between high mountains and deep valleys. Fields and pastures muddied refer to the floods that spread, akin to soil clods scattered in the fields.]<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The origin refers to the earth receiving energy from heaven, leading to the emergence and growth of the earth&#39;s essence, which is universally transformed by the earth. The illnesses of the people—such as abdominal distension and intestinal sounds—are all caused by the influence of the earth&#39;s energy. The four energies emerge at the transition between summer and autumn, characterized as the four energies. When the Taiyin reaches, it brings clouds and rain; mayflies are born in the morning and die by evening, transformed by damp energy. The moisture from the earth vaporizes to form clouds overhead while it transforms below, giving rise to mayflies. This signifies the onset of oppressive conditions. </p>
<p>The manifestation of metal-related disturbances—when the heavens are clear and the earth is bright, with a refreshing wind and sharp atmosphere—brings about a great chill. Smoke rises from grass and trees as the dry air begins to stir. With mist and fog appearing frequently, a murderous energy approaches, causing plants to wither; thus, metal begins to produce sound. Consequently, people suffer from coughing, reverse ailments, fullness in the heart and rib area, pains that worsen with movement, dry throats, and a pale, dust-covered complexion. Mountains and marshes become scorched and withered, with the earth crystallized by frost and salt. This signifies an outbreak, and there are five manifestations of this energy. </p>
<p>As night falls and white dew forms, the sounds of the forest become sorrowful, signaling the arrival of oppressive energy. </p>
<p>(Note: The bright clarity and sharpness are commanded by the energy of metal; the cold, dry, and lethal energy also belongs to metal. This response of the metal energy that has been stagnating indicates a restoration of governance. Coughing and a dry throat are ailments of the lungs. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that the lesser yang in the foot indicates movement, causing pain in the heart and ribs, preventing turning; in severe cases, the face shows a slight dustiness and lacks moisture.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the energy of metal becomes abundant, it causes the wood of the liver to become ill. The soil that condenses like frost and salt refers to substances like Glauber&#39;s salt and nitre. The five energies are derived from the five elemental energies. The night brings dense white dew, indicating the dew&#39;s thickness like frost. The sound of the forest is sorrowful among the trees, signifying the voice of autumn. The stagnation of metal energy is a precursor to its release.</p>
<p>The stagnation of water leads to the emergence of yang energy, while yin energy surges violently. As extreme cold arrives, rivers and marshes solidify, and the cold mist forms into frost and snow. In severe cases, the atmosphere appears yellow and dark, and the mingling of energies results in frost killing. Thus, water reveals signs. Therefore, people suffer from cold-related heart pain, pain in the waist and lower back, and stiffness in major joints, leading to discomfort in bending and stretching. They also feel symptoms such as cold limb reversal, hardness in the abdomen, and fullness.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The outbreak of intense heat causes the great void to become obscured, the sun and moon lose their brilliance. The heat rises, signaling the arrival of the great summer, scorching the mountains and marshes, causing wood to weep, sending smoke billowing from vast roofs. The earth is parched, resembling frost and brine; stagnant water diminishes, creeping grass turns yellow, and winds carry confusing words, with dampness arriving late. Therefore, the people suffer from low energy, sores, abscesses, and swellings in the sides, abdomen, chest, and limbs; they feel bloating in their bodies, experience vomiting and reverse peristalsis, suffer from bone pain and joint movement issues, endure sudden abdominal pain and blood flowing uncontrollably, with diminished reproductive fluids and reddened eyes and heated hearts. In severe cases, this leads to dizziness and melancholy, often resulting in sudden death. This marks the culmination of great heat, causing sweat to dampen the lower abdomen. The heat causes a chaotic rise in energy, which then becomes calm again. When yang reaches its peak, it reverses into yin, and the dampness transforms and solidifies. Life-giving moisture turns to frost, mountains and rivers become icy and snowy; the fierce summer sun foreshadows tumultuous times ahead. </p>
<p>(Note: Great light refers to the brilliance of the sun and moon. The rising heat obscures their brightness. The description of the earth resembling frost and brine comes from the moist heat that rises, creating a frost-like substance. Confusing words refer to the chaotic way the heat spreads from the fires. The combination of wind and fire means that the damp energy lingers before transforming, leading to the various ailments among the people, all of which result from excess heat harming energy and blood. Low energy indicates that fire consumes energy. Dizziness pertains to lung issues. Excessive heat harms vital essence, which leads to sudden death.

Movement returns to stillness; when Yang reaches its peak, it reacts with Yin. The lesser Yin brings heat, which eventually leads to cold, as the lesser Yin follows both the essence and the sign. Humidity causes transformation and completion; the lesser Yang brings forth fire, leading to steam and humidity. Water freezes into ice and snow, signifying intense cold. The energy of light and vapor emerges from the condensed water. The heat of flames arises in the heat of midday lakes, where mountains and lakes share energy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor said: &quot;When water causes hail and snow, when earth causes drifting and sudden changes, when wood causes destruction and collapse, when metal brings clarity, and when fire creates dimness, what force causes these phenomena?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The essence varies in quantity, and its manifestations range from subtle to extreme. The subtle corresponds to its essence, while the extreme encompasses its lesser manifestations, which can be understood by observing the lesser forces below.&quot;</p>
<p>(This explains the congestion of the five movements as influenced by the dominance of the six essences.) According to the discussion on the six subtle forces, one might inquire about the geographical correspondences and the positions of the six seasonal essences. Qi Bo replied: &quot;To the right of the prominent is the position of the monarch fire. To the right of the monarch fire, one steps back and is treated by the minister fire; move back another step, and the earth essence treats it; again, move back a step, and the metal essence treats it; again back a step, and the water essence treats it; one more step back, and the wood essence treats it; and again back a step, and the monarch fire treats it once more. Below the minister fire, the water essence acts; below the water position, the earth essence supports; below the earth position, the wind essence supports; below the wind position, the metal essence supports; below the metal position, the fire essence supports; below the monarch fire, the yin essence supports. This points to the positioning of the six essences, each having a supportive role below. Hence, it is said that by observing the lesser forces beneath, one can gain understanding. It denotes the subordination of the six essences below; thus, the appearance of hail and snow from the water initiation and drifting changes from the earth initiation becomes clear. The variation in essence denotes the energies of the five movements—which can be excessive or insufficient. The manifestations may be subtle or violent, with the substance corresponding to its intrinsic energy manifesting naturally.&quot;<a id="trans-293p" href="#orig-293p" class="marker">[293p]</a></p></div>

The essence of distinguishing this chapter’s repetition lies in receiving the accumulation of the six energies, rather than the mutual overcoming of the five movements. The Emperor said: Excellent. What causes the energies to emerge inappropriately? Qi Bo replied: It is determined by discrepancy. The Emperor asked: Is there a specific number for discrepancy? Qi Bo answered: Typically, each is thirty degrees, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Position&quot; refers to the time governed by the five movements. &quot;Destiny&quot; means to command. &quot;Discrepancy&quot; indicates variance. The emergence of the five movements, when not at their original positions, signifies discrepancies in governance. For instance, water, positioned in winter, should emerge in the first and second months, but instead emerges early; earth, positioned in late summer, should emerge in the seventh and eighth months, but instead, emerges early; metal, in autumn, should emerge in the ninth and tenth months, but instead, emerges early; fire, in summer, should emerge in the seventh and eighth months, but emerges early. All emerge thirty days too soon, as accumulation leads to emergence, hence the slight delay from the original position.)</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about the timing of energy’s arrival? Qi Bo replied: If the movement is excessive, then arrival is early; if the movement is insufficient, then arrival is late—this is the norm of observation. The Emperor asked: What is it that arrives exactly on time? Qi Bo replied: If it is neither excessive nor insufficient, it arrives on time.

The &quot;Qi&quot; refers to the seasonal energies, while &quot;Transformation&quot; pertains to the changes brought about by the Five Movements. Each Movement governs a peculiar period of seventy-two days. If there is excess, then the Qi arrives prematurely; if there is deficiency, it arrives belatedly. This is the usual state of timing. If there is neither excess nor deficiency, then the Qi arrives at the proper time. Conversely, if this is not the case, then the energies of growth, transformation, storage, and collection will not align properly, resulting in calamities of the four seasons.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: Excellent. Why do energies transform at improper times? Qibo replied: When there is excess, it aligns with the time, and when there is deficiency, it is due to its own dominance.</p>
<p>[Note: This discussion concerns the excess and deficiency of the Six Qis regarding the timing as well. Each Qi governs peculiar periods of sixty days. For instance, the pure and clear Qi operates in spring, the hot Qi in autumn, the cold and condensed Qi in summer, and the humid and steamy Qi in winter. This is known as transformation at improper times. The excess corresponds to the proper timing and each manages the cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. The deficiency refers to its own dominance. &quot;Dominance&quot; refers to the prevailing Qi, indicating the transformation out of season.]</p>
<p>The Emperor said: The Qi of the four seasons can be early or late. How do the variations in high, low, left, and right manifest? Qibo replied: There are both counterflow and flow, leading to delays and speeds.

Spring energy starts from the left, autumn energy starts from the right, winter energy starts from the back, and summer energy starts from the front. These are the regular transformations of the four seasons; therefore, in the highest places, winter energy is always present; in the lowest places, spring energy is always present. One must carefully observe this. The Emperor said, &quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>This discusses the energy of the four seasons, noting excess and deficiency. Drought arises from what comes before and what comes after. The natural order is that spring energy moves west, summer energy moves north, autumn energy moves east, and winter energy moves south. The reverse order is the inverse of this. Spring energy is born in the east, thus it travels from east to west; summer energy originates in the south, hence it moves from south to north; autumn energy starts in the west, so it travels from west to east; winter energy begins in the north, thus moving from north to south. This reflects the response of the four seasons to the four directions. Therefore, spring energy rises from below, and autumn energy descends from above; the fire energy of summer spreads out from the center to all sides; the concealed energy of winter returns inward from the surface. The left corresponds to east, the right to west, the front to departure, and the back to the abyss. This represents the high and low, left and right of the four seasons, indicating their regular transformations. Hence, in the highest places, winter energy is always present, representing the energy of storage, moving down from above and inward from outside.

The previously mentioned &#39;Initial Qi&#39; and &#39;Second Qi&#39; refer to the guest Qi from following movements, circling through the Six Periods, each with its distinct characteristics. This also reflects the governing energy of the Four Seasons: Spring representing Wood, Summer representing Fire, Autumn representing Metal, and Winter representing Water, each governing unique 72-day periods. Additionally, there are the Initial Qi governing Jueyin, the Second Qi governing Shaoyin, the Third Qi governing Shaoyang, the Fourth Qi governing Taiyin, the Fifth Qi governing Yangming, and the Sixth Qi governing Taiyang, each governing 60 days and specifically 87.5 units of time. These are the energies of the Four Seasons that do not change, along with their regulations concerning cold, heat, warmth, coolness, growth, and storage, thus called &#39;constant.&#39;)</p>
<p>Qibo continued: &quot;Allow me to elaborate. The influence of Qi manifests in different forms: Jueyin leads to harmony, Shaoyin to mild warmth, Taiyin to damp heaviness, Shaoyang to hot summers, Yangming to clear vigor, and Taiyang to cold atmospheres. These are the constants of seasonal transformations.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The influence of Qi refers to how the energies of the Four Seasons and the Five Movements relate to each other. The spring energy is gentle and late, hence the notion of harmony.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of growth and transformation is linked to the five seasonal energies. The wind, which shapes and manifests this essence, represents the consistent nature of transformation. </p>
<p>Where the Jueyin influence arrives, it causes the wind to arise, typically resulting in a dry atmosphere. The arrival of Shaoyin brings forth heat, leading to coldness. The Taoyin brings about moisture, ultimately resulting in rainfall. When Shaoyang arrives, it brings fire, culminating in steam and humidity. The arrival of Yangming leads to dryness, which eventually brings about coolness. Lastly, when Taiyang arrives, it induces coldness, which brings warmth in the middle. This is the principle of virtuous transformation.</p>
<p>All four seasons have airy influences capable of nurturing the myriad forms of life, yet they can also lead to destruction. Shaoyin and Taiyang are the masters of water and fire, yin and yang respectively. Taiyang indicates the positive and is fundamentally cold; Shaoyin indicates the negative and is fundamentally hot. Above Shaoyin, hot air governs, revealing Taiyang; above Taiyang, cold air governs, revealing Shaoyin. The interplay of yin and yang transforms, hence there is cold in the middle and warmth in the middle as well.</p>
<p>The wet earth energy of Taoyin rises, transforms into clouds and rain, resulting ultimately in precipitation. The fire of Shaoyang, which arises from the earth and marsh, culminates in humidity. The dryness of Yangming finally yields clarity and coolness. The living essence is attributed to the virtues born of the six energies, inducing characteristics of coolness and serenity.</p>
<p>Where Jueyin influences, it leads to fur-like transformation; where Shaoyin influences, it results in feather-like transformation; where Taoyin influences, it culminates in naked transformation; where Shaoyang influences, it leads to feather-like transformation; where Yangming influences, it leads to shell-like transformation; where Taiyang influences, it leads to scale-like transformation. This is the common principle of virtuous transformation.<a id="trans-299p" href="#orig-299p" class="marker">[299p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five types of insects are born and grow due to the influence of the five movements and six energies, hence they are the norm of moral transformation. The arrival of Jueyin results in generation and transformation; when Shaoyin arrives, it causes flourishing transformation; Taiyin brings about moistening transformation; Shaoyang leads to abundant transformation; Yangming results in solid transformation; and Taiyang causes concealed transformation. This is the regularity of governance. </p>
<p>The processes of generation, flourishing, moistening, abundance, solidity, and concealment correspond to the regulation of the six energies and are manifested through the four seasons. </p>
<p>The arrival of Jueyin brings about swift changes with fierce cold; Shaoyin leads to extreme warmth and cold; Taiyin results in sudden thunder and violent winds; Shaoyang leads to swirling winds and frost formations; Yangming brings scattered warmth; and Taiyang results in cold snow, hail, and dust. This reflects the regularity of atmospheric changes. </p>
<p>Swift changes refer to variations in wind, with cold representing the metal energy supporting it. Extreme warmth relates to the intensity of fire, while cold corresponds to the support of yin essence. Sudden thunder and heavy rain denote changes in damp earth, with wind energy reaching its peak. Whirling winds emerge from the union of fire. The intensity of blazing flames is supported by water energy when it reaches its extreme. Extreme dispersal denotes the harshness of cold, with warmth still being supported by fire energy. Intense cold, snow, hail, and severe cold are, at their peak, supported by earth energy. Therefore, at the extreme, energy transforms; transformation leads to harm, but support governs. </p>
<p>The arrival of Jueyin is characterized by movement and following; Shaoyin is associated with lofty flames and dusk; Taiyin is linked to deep shadow, dust, and darkness; Shaoyang corresponds to illumination, rosy clouds, and dusk.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: This refers to common ailments in autumn. Obstruction relates to the difficulty in urination.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the qi is high, it rises; when the qi is low, it descends. This means that in spring, the qi begins from below, thus the movement of qi is ruled by the wood of the negative yin; in autumn, the qi begins from above, thus the movement of qi belongs to the dry metal of the positive yang; in summer, the qi begins at the front, thus the movement of qi rules over the heat of the lesser yang; in winter, the qi begins from behind, thus the movement of qi belongs to the solid cold of the greater yang. These four seasons and six types of qi have their established positions and are not like the transient disturbances of external qi. Therefore, when wind prevails, movement occurs; when heat prevails, swelling occurs; when dryness prevails, there is dryness; when cold prevails, it becomes superficial; when humidity prevails, it becomes moist and leaks; if extreme, it can lead to water retention and swelling. The changes are described according to the location of the qi.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: I wish to hear about its application. Qi Bo replied: The application of the six types of qi each returns to being overcome and transforms accordingly. Therefore, the great yin transforms into rain and is applied to the greater yang; the greater yang transforms from cold and is applied to the lesser yin; the lesser yin transforms from heat and is applied to the positive yangming; the positive yangming transforms from dryness and is applied to the negative yin; the negative yin transforms from wind and is applied to the great yin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The energies associated with their respective seasons are as follows: the energy of the Taiyin is present in late summer; the energy of the Taiyang is present in winter; the energy of the Shaoyin is present in summer; the energy of the Yangming is present in autumn; and the energy of the Jueyin is present in spring. Just as winter brings rain to signify the superiority of Taiyin, summer has its cold transformations to represent the superiority of Taiyang. This aligns with the understanding that spring surpasses late summer, and late summer surpasses winter.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What does it mean to be in one&#39;s rightful position? Qibo replied: To be in one&#39;s rightful position is to embody constant transformation. The Emperor said: I would like to hear more about this. Qibo explained: By determining their positions, it can be known in which month they reside.</p>
<p>The note clarifies that being in one&#39;s rightful position refers to the six energies of the four seasons, each governing its appropriate position, representing the constancy of seasonal transformations. The Jueyin is positioned in the first and second months, while the Shaoyin is in the third and fourth months. By identifying their positions and the corresponding months, the location of the six energies can be understood.</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired: What of the energies in their six positions? How do they wax and wane? Qibo replied: There is a great difference in their dynamics. The Tai signifies a slow and consistent rise, while the Sha signifies a rapid decline and disappearance.</p>
<p>The note explains that the six seasonal energies vary between fullness and emptiness, following the annual cyclical nature. If the annual cycle is excessive, the energies in their six positions will be full; if insufficient, they will be empty. The excess energy rises slowly and steadily, while the deficient energy comes quickly and briefly, hence it is said that the Sha signifies a rapid decline and disappearance.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What about the changes of fullness and emptiness? Qibo said: If the sky&#39;s energy is insufficient, then the earth&#39;s energy follows suit; if the earth&#39;s energy is lacking, then the sky&#39;s energy corresponds. The principles operate in between, and the celestial energy is often predominant. The unfavorable situations arise when energies cannot prevail, and they return to a common harmony, resulting in illnesses through the following and adapting to changes. Thus, when the upper energy prevails, the sky&#39;s energy descends; when the lower energy prevails, the earth&#39;s energy rises, differing in quantity. Minor discrepancies are small, while major discrepancies can lead to significant changes and shifts in positions. When energies exchange, major transformations occur, leading to ailments. The main point states: Major discrepancies are measured at five parts, whereas minor discrepancies at seven parts; their differences are observable. This is what is meant. </p>
<p>[Note: This discussion addresses the six energies of the seasons, also noting the distinctions between the fullness and emptiness of heaven and earth, and their mutual victories. Above the midpoint of the year, the sky&#39;s energy rules; below that point, the earth&#39;s energy is dominant. The principles reside in the midst of heaven and earth, consistently guiding the energies towards dominance. Therefore, it is said that following and adapting to changes results in illnesses. This refers to the energies of heaven and earth returning to harmonize in response to the prevailing energies and their mutual victories. The term &quot;energy exchange&quot; pertains to the interactions of the three and four energies. For example, if the sky&#39;s energy is insufficient, then the earth&#39;s energy will follow, thus the earth’s energy from soil will first interact with the fire of the sky; conversely, if the earth&#39;s energy is lacking, the sky&#39;s energy will follow, thus the fire of the sky first interacts with the soil energy of the earth. This union of fire and soil is termed a common harmony and represents minor victories. Minor discrepancies denote small differences, where the heavens maintain seven parts while three engage with the earth, and vice versa; this interaction does not lead to illness among the people.]<a id="trans-305p" href="#orig-305p" class="marker">[305p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The evil that one cannot overcome is the energy of oneself that cannot be surpassed. When the sun cools, it applies to the lesser yin. When the yang brightness dries, it applies to the extreme yin. When the lower energies prevail, the earth&#39;s energy rises. The extreme yin transforms into wind, applying to the greater yin. The lesser yin transforms into fire, applying to the yang brightness. When the upper energies prevail, the heavenly energy descends, thus it becomes the greatest dominance. In extreme cases, there is a significant shift; significant shifts reside in the heavens&#39; cycle at five parts, directly descending downwards; in the earth&#39;s cycle, it resides in five parts, and it conversely rises upwards. Hence it is said, in extreme cases, the positions shift. When energies exchange, a great change occurs, leading to illness. The shift in position refers to surpassing the positions of three energies and four energies, while the initial two energies operate in the five positions and six positions, with the five energies and six energies operating in the initial and second positions. This dominance by the energy that cannot be overcome is termed as the evil that cannot be surpassed; it surpasses its position and adds to it, thus causing great changes. If it returns to harmony, then it does not exceed its position.</p>

When the cold arrives, it causes rigidity, fullness and urgent pain in the abdomen, leading to diarrhea; when heat arrives, it causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dysentery, abscesses, confusion, convulsions, swelling, vomiting, nasal bleeding, headaches, joint pain, muscle aches, excessive bleeding, and urinary problems. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How can one treat this? Qibo replied: One must follow the seasons; those who violate this should be treated with the opposites. Notes: This refers to the six energies of the seasons; one should avoid the cold and the heat. The acrid and sweet disperse as Yang; therefore, illnesses that require dispersing should avoid heat. Sour and bitter bring forth as Yin; thus, if an illness requires purging, one should avoid the cold. If a person is ill but should not disperse or purge, and they act recklessly, cold and heat will invade within, worsening their condition. If one has no illness but does not avoid heat or cold, then rigidity, fullness, fever, and vomiting will arise. By &quot;time,&quot; it refers to the four seasons; for treatment with opposites, if one is affected by heat, treat with the cold that counters it; if affected by cold, treat with the heat that counters it.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This text discusses the accumulation of a fetus in relation to the dualities of yin and yang, and the distinctions between cold and heat that should be avoided. The weight of the body signifies pregnancy. Toxic substances are those that are extremely cold or hot. In the initial months of pregnancy, different elements govern the nurturing of the fetus: wood in the first two months, fire in the third and fourth months, earth in the fifth and sixth, metal in the seventh and eighth, and water in the ninth and tenth months. When the sun rises, the five elements complete their cycle, and yin and yang separate water and fire, forming the physical body after birth. However, before birth, the energies of the five elements may be either strong or weak, dominant or stagnant, and should be adjusted according to cold, heat, warmth, and coolness to maintain balance. If there are ailments, one may not escalate the exposure to cold or heat significantly, which would not harm the fetal energy. This indicates that despite potential issues, one should be careful not to excessively err, as this can lead to harm. The accumulation and gathering relate to the organs governed by the five elements, which must not be excessively exposed to cold or heat. If transgressed too much, the result can be fatal. Cold, heat, warmth, and coolness are considered the four fears, which must be approached with caution.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked how to treat severe stagnation. Qibo replied: Wood releases stagnation, fire stimulates it, earth takes it away, metal drains it, and water breaks it. It is essential to adjust the energy; if in excess, it must be reduced, since it is feared. This is referred to as draining. The Emperor then asked about false energy. Qibo replied: If there is false energy present, then there are no restrictions. This refers to insufficient primary energy and excessive guest energy.</p>
<p>This indicates the seasonal stagnation and the methods for adjustment and treatment.<a id="trans-308p" href="#orig-308p" class="marker">[308p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the oppression of the vital energies is severe, the Yin of the moon acts upon the Yang of the sun, leading to water stagnation; the Yang of the sun acts upon the Shaoyin, resulting in fire stagnation; the Shaoyin affects the Yangming, causing metal stagnation; the Yangming influences the Jueyin, resulting in wood stagnation; and the Jueyin acts upon the Taiyin, leading to soil stagnation. The method of adjustment is as follows: for wood stagnation, it should be relaxed; for fire stagnation, it should be dispersed; for soil stagnation, it should be removed; for metal stagnation, it should be drained; and for water stagnation, it should be redirected. However, when adjusting the defeating energy, if it is excessive, it should be tempered with its own fear, so that it does not return. What is meant by &quot;drain&quot; refers to draining the prevailing energy. This applies not as a strict seasonal victory—summer over winter, winter over summer, summer over autumn, autumn over spring, or spring over late summer—but rather indicates a deficiency in the main energy, with the guest energy prevailing.<a id="trans-309p" href="#orig-309p" class="marker">[309p]</a></p></div>

Among the five movements, Shaoyin does not govern the transformation of energy but follows the Yin and Yang of the six qi in their upward and downward, left and right movements; hence the question about the location of Yin. The sage stands facing south, with the front known as Guangming and the back as Taichong. The place called Taichong corresponds to Shaoyin, while above it is called Taiyang. Thus, Taichong represents the Kan position, and Guangming represents the Li position. Shaoyin governs the water of the heavenly one, while above it is the fire of Taiyang. Therefore, in the northern governance year, it aligns with the three Yins and is in Kan; in the southern governance year, it aligns with the three Yangs and is in Li.

The governance of the five movements has both southern and northern aspects; the nature of the slight yin has both yin and yang, thus allowing for the movement up and down. The cun and chi measure the blood vessels; blood is the essence of the middle burner, flowing downward to become essence, nourishing the heart spirit, transforming into red blood. Therefore, the pulse starts at the foot&#39;s slight yin kidney and is governed by the hand&#39;s slight yin heart, hence the diagnosis of the cun and chi&#39;s yin and yang serves to assess the upper and lower aspects of slight yin.</p>
<p>The physician Qi Bo said: In the years of northern governance, if slight yin is at the pulse, then the cun will not react; if jueyin is at the pulse, then the right will not react; if taiyin is at the pulse, then the left will not react. In the years of southern governance, if slight yin controls heaven, then the cun will not react; if jueyin controls heaven, then the right will not react; if taiyin controls heaven, then the left will not react.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of the earth, governing the transformation and movement of the five elements. The transformation occurs in five years, leading to a shift to the right, and among the five elements, there are two instances of fire; hence, the lord of fire does not govern the transformation of qi. However, despite not being in charge of movement, there is a position that it occupies. Above the lesser yin, the lord of fire presides, indicating that the lesser yin is rooted in yin and governs yang, thus the south&#39;s governance occurs in yang, while the north&#39;s governance occurs in yin. The celestial authority is positioned in the south, at the spring, and in the north; this establishes the orientation of heaven and earth. When a person faces south to diagnose, the inch denotes yang and is in the south, while the foot denotes yin and is in the north. In the year of northern governance, the lesser yin is located at the spring, and therefore aligns with yin in the north, resulting in the absence of pulse response at the inch. In the year of southern governance, the lesser yin presides over heaven, thus it aligns with yin in the south, leading to the same absence of pulse response at the inch. The absence of response indicates a weak pulse that does not register during diagnosis.

The kidney meridian connects to the heart, hence the heartache. The heart governs blood, and with cold forces pressing in, blood is seen.

Bitterness can overcome dampness, and heat harmonizes with the yin. Acidity comes from wood transformation; thus, it is complemented with a mild sourness.

The mild flavor is used to drain; it represents yang through its penetrating qualities.</p>

<p>The Emperor said: Good. What of the changes in the weather? Qi Bo replied: The Jue Yin regulates the heavens; when wind and dampness prevail, the great void becomes obscure, causing disturbances in the clouds. Cold arises from the spring qi, making the flowing water not freeze. The people suffer from pain in the stomach and heart, with pain in both flanks, obstruction in the diaphragm and throat, inability to eat or drink, a strong tongue with vomiting when eating, diarrhea, abdominal distension, watery loose stools, and water retention. Hibernating insects do not leave, and the illness originates in the spleen. If the Chong Yang is depleted, one cannot recover from death.</p>
<p>The note indicates that Jue Yin governs the heavens, as in the years of Zi and Hai. The wind and dampness above cause the great void to become obscure; disturbances in the clouds and cold arising from spring qi prevent the flowing water from freezing. According to the meridian sections, a strong tongue, vomiting when eating, stomach pain, abdominal distension, inability to drink, loose stools, and water retention are all ailments of the spleen meridian, as the overpowering wind and wood cause illness in the spleen. Hibernating insects hide in the earth; due to the external invasion of the wind qi, they do not leave. The Chong Yang, residing on the foot where the Yangming stomach meridian is located, corresponds to the arteries of the hands. With the stomach&#39;s qi extinguished, one cannot recover from death.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The stomach&#39;s qi is rebellious, hence the lack of desire to eat. Coughing up blood indicates that heart fire is rising, failing to connect the upper and lower parts. The Scripture on Meridians states: the kidneys govern movement; when the eyes fail to see, the heart hangs as if in hunger. This is due to the heart and kidneys not communicating, rendering the heart suspended above and feeling like hunger. The earth&#39;s dampness overpowers water, hence the illness originates from the kidneys. Tai Xi, the kidney&#39;s artery, is located above the outer ankle bone. If the Tai Xi pulse does not reach, then the kidney qi has already been depleted, leading to an untreatable death. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The note states that the arrival of cold air is referred to as the sun being the chief of all yang, representing the fire of the ruler. However, originating from the cold water below, the cold air now comes from above, resulting in cold both above and below, while the sun&#39;s movement resides in the middle, thus it is said to operate with intense fire. When cold comes from above, if the yang can overcome it, this is the so-called occurrence where injury from cold manifests as heat illness, which reflects a reversal of its essence, resulting in identifiable sickness. Therefore, treating the reversal of its essence leads to effective methods; this is akin to the sun acting based on its essence and the recognition of the overpowering forces of cold and heat. As a result, conditions like abscesses, vomiting blood, nasal bleeding, and abdominal fullness are signs of excessive yang heat. Similarly, symptoms like heart pain, dizziness, face redness, and yellowing of the eyes indicate that cold is attacking the fire of the heart, forcing its heat upwards. The conflict between water and fire, cold and heat, leads to the closing off of the Shenmen pulse, extinguishing the heart&#39;s energy. Shenmen, the heart&#39;s acupoint, is located at the tip of the bony edge of the palm, where the artery can be felt.

<p><strong>Huangdi’s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Ultimate Truth [Volume Two]</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: How do the six Qi overcome one another? Qibo replied: The victory of Jueyin causes ear ringing and dizziness, a feeling of wanting to vomit, and a feeling of cold in the stomach. Frequent occurrences of strong wind prevent the growth of parasites. The Qi of the liver and diaphragm gathers and transforms into heat, leading to yellow and red urine. The pain is at the heart of the stomach; there’s pain under the ribs, and sounds in the intestines with diarrhea. There is pain in the lower abdomen, and the discharge is red and white; in severe cases, there may be vomiting, and the throat is obstructed. </p>
<p>[Note: This discussion is about the three Yin and three Yang that dominate the Qi of the seasons, causing illnesses among the people. It is appropriate to balance the prevailing Qi and its flavors. Ear ringing and dizziness signify excessive Wood effects upwards. Frequent strong winds indicate overreach from below upwards. The feeling of wanting to vomit and a cold in the stomach signify a stomach illness. The non-thriving of parasites signifies that Wood tones it down. Gathering of liver Qi indicates a buildup. Transforming into heat with yellow-red urine reflects the excess of Wood creating fire. When wind and Wood prevail, the spleen and stomach are affected; hence, when wind Qi overwhelms upward, it leads to pain in the stomach and heart, and discomfort below the ribs. In severe cases, there may be vomiting and obstructed throat; when it overwhelms below, there are sounds in the intestines with diarrhea, pain in the lower abdomen, and the discharge being red and white—which refers to the harm done by wind, good at acting and changing frequently.]<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The victory of the Lesser Yin is characterized by heat beneath the heart, leading to a good appetite, along with a reaction below the navel and the qi circulating through the three burners. When summer heat arrives, the wood becomes moist, while the grass withers. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, irritability, abdominal fullness and pain, diarrhea, and the manifestation of red dysentery.</p>
<p>(Note: Heat below the heart leads to a good appetite; the external fire interacts with the internal. The reaction below the navel indicates the mark of the Lesser Yin, with the yin venting from below. The qi circulating through the three burners refers to the primary qi moving up and down, meeting in the center. The arrival of summer heat coincides with the interaction of the Lesser Yang qi. Wood becoming moist indicates nourishment from the Lesser Yin&#39;s yin fluids. Grass withering is a result of the heat from the two fiery elements above. Nausea and vomiting indicate the upward rebellion of yin qi. Irritability is a sign of the interaction between yin and yang&#39;s cold and heat. Abdominal fullness and diarrhea indicate the presence of cold yin below. The manifestation of red dysentery reflects the downward indulgence of the ruling fire.)</p>
<p>The victory of the Greater Yin is characterized by internal accumulation of fire qi, leading to sores and ulcers within, and spreading outward. The illness affects the sides of the body; severe cases involve hot pain in the heart, headaches, throat obstruction, and stiffness of the neck. Alone, it triumphs when dampness accumulates internally, with cold pressing down on the lower jiao, causing pain that radiates from the crown and pulls between the eyebrows, along with fullness in the stomach. When rain comes frequently, dryness transforms into visibility. Symptoms include fullness in the lower abdomen, heaviness in the waist and lower back, discomfort internally, leading to ease of urination or diarrhea, warm feet, heavy head, and swelling in the legs and shins.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Drinking rises from within, causing swelling above. </p>
<p>[Note: The moist and damp energy emanates externally, thus the heat energy is constrained internally, resulting in sores and ulcers within. When the damp heat energy spreads outward, it affects the wind and wood, leading to ailments in the ribs and flanks. In severe cases, it may cause heart pain, as the wood energy intensifies and transmits to the fire. Heat causing headaches, throat constriction, and stiff neck results from the mingling of wind-fire energy and dampness, rising from the neck to the top of the head. This speaks to the yin energy, which combines with fire and earth to manifest before mid-year. The dominant force afterwards is the damp and moist energy, which prevails post mid-year. The dampness in the middle causes internal stagnation that presses upon the lower organs. Pain centered at the top and drawing between the eyebrows indicates the wind-fire energy lingers at the crown, flowing through the yangming meridian and downward to congest the stomach. If rain frequently occurs and dryness is suddenly displayed, this condition appears at the exchanges of the four and five energies. Fullness in the lower abdomen and heaviness in the waist indicate the dampness rising and affecting the kidneys. Warm feet with heavy heads show the flow of wind-fire energy downward. Swollen shins and ankles are caused by earth and water intermingling. Drinking rises from within and swelling appears above, indicating the presence of water pathogens moving from the lower body, through the middle, to the upper.<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of Lesser Yang&#39;s dominance, a hot pathogen invades the stomach, causing heart distress and pain, red eyes with a desire to vomit, sour vomiting accompanied by hunger, ear pain with red urine, easily frightened, and delirium. Violent heat causes consumption. Grass withers and water dries up, insects are forced to bend. Pain in the lower abdomen leads to red and white diarrhea.</p>
<p>(Note: The energy of Lesser Yang combines with the three burners, hence the heat residing in the stomach. The origin of the three burners emanates from the area of the stomach. The three burners connect with the pericardium, leading to heart distress and pain. The pulse of the three burners ascends to the ears, interlacing with the sharp corners of the eyes, therefore, indulgence above causes ear pain and red eyes, indulgence in the middle leads to sour vomiting and hunger, indulgence below results in red urine, lower abdominal pain, and red and white diarrhea. Easily frightened and delirious due to intense heat relates to the Yangming stomach channel&#39;s heat. The energy of the three burners steams fluids and transforms nutrients and blood. Consumption results from excessive heat harming the blood and fluids. Grass withering indicates heat above. Water drying indicates burning heat below. Insects bending represents heat present in the intersection of energies, where humans interact with heaven and earth.)</p>
<p>In the case of Yangming&#39;s dominance, clarity emerges from within. Left-sided rib pain and diarrhea occur. Internally there is a throat blockage, externally there is litigation-like hernia.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The cold and austere energy of Metal leads to clear qi emerging from within. When Metal prevails, the energy of Wood becomes deficient, resulting in side pain (inguinal hernia). When clear qi is abundant below, it causes diarrhea; when abundant above, it causes throat obstruction. The great chill is violent and extreme; thus, flowers and elegance change, and caterpillars bring disaster. When there are difficulties in the chest, with throat blockage and coughing, it is due to the dryness of Metal affecting the Lung, responding to corresponding energies.</p>
<p>When the Sun&#39;s energy prevails, it solidifies and arrives, leading to icy conditions out of season, thus transforming later. When hemorrhoids and intermittent fever arise, cold and restraint invade the stomach, creating internal heart pain; within, ulcers develop, and hidden pathways are obstructed. Yin regions pull at one another, causing muscular and tendon constriction, blood vessels become clotted and weep, affecting color change; it may cause blood to leak, the skin to swell, the abdomen to bloat with diminished appetite, with heat reversing upward, causing pain in the head, neck, crown, and brain orbs seeming to detach. When cold enters the lower jiao, it leads to profuse diarrhea.</p>
<p>The cold water energy of the Sun prevails, thus it solidifies and arrives. The out-of-season icy water implies that the prevailing energy was strong a year and a half prior, thus causing the insects&#39; later transformation. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states that those suffering from hemorrhoids and intermittent fever are affected by the cold and hot evil of the Sun. When restraint enters the stomach, it indicates water insult to the earth.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The stomach channels connect upwards to the heart, which is why heart pain occurs. In the realm of yin, there are ulcers, thus causing hidden curves to be obstructed and pulling at the yin groin. The foot&#39;s sun channel governs the tendons, which is why the muscles are tense and rigid. Blood vessels swell and change color, possibly leading to a blood discharge due to evil entering the meridians. If the skin is swollen and puffy, it is the sun’s qi that governs the surface. If the abdomen is distended with reduced appetite, it is due to water qi overwhelming the spleen. When heat rises instead of descending, the sun’s qi follows the meridians up into the brain and then emerges at the nape. The sun meridians originate at the inner canthus of the eyes, which is why the eyes may appear dislocated. When cold enters the lower burn, the sun signifies warmth while fundamentally being cold, resulting in yang heat rising and yin cold descending.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How should it be treated?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;For the victory of Jueyin, treat with sweet and clear remedies, assisted by bitter and pungent herbs, and sour to purge.

<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What about the resurgence of the six qi?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;What a comprehensive question! The resurgence of Jueyin manifests as a hard and distended lower abdomen, with sudden and intense pain. Like trees swaying and sand flying, the warmth of life is absent. There is pain in the heart, sweating, vomiting, and inability to retain food, which goes in and then comes out again; there is dizziness in the muscles and bones, and if there is severe cold, it may affect the spleen, leading to food stagnation and vomiting. When Chongyang is exhausted, it results in death without treatment.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The resurgence refers to the qi of the three yin and three yang being defeated by excessive conditions, leading to a buildup that then breaks out. A hard and distended lower abdomen, coupled with sudden and intense pain, indicates that Jueyin&#39;s qi is pent up and ready to erupt. Like trees swaying and sand flying reflects a strong resurgence of pent-up anger. When the warmth of life is absent, it shows the wind qi has emerged while the earth qi has weakened. Heart pain is characterized by a pallid complexion like that of a corpse, with an inability to take deep breaths, indicating that Jueyin&#39;s qi is affecting the heart.]</strong><a id="trans-352p" href="#orig-352p" class="marker">[352p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sweating indicates that the warmth of wind and heat is added to the Yin. Vomiting and inability to intake food suggest that excessive wood has caused the earth to fail. Muscle and bone pain indicates a surging of wind energy.

The Chongyang is the artery of the stomach, and this indicates a surplus of wind energy while the energy of the earth is depleted. </p>
<p>The return of the lesser Yin brings internal heat, resulting in restlessness, sneezing, and cramping pain in the lower abdomen. Fire is seen raging; the throat is dry. Symptoms occur at intermittent times: energy moves on the left and rises on the right, leading to cough, skin pain, sudden mute episodes, heart pain, and mental confusion. There may also be chills and shivers, along with delirium, heat without relief, thirst leading to a desire for drink, shortness of breath, and muscular weakness. There is difficulty with bowel movements, external swelling, and belching. The red energy transforms behind, with flowing water unable to freeze. Heat energy spreads widely, insects do not reappear, and ailments like rashes, sores, pus-filled lesions, and carbuncles worsen, possibly entering the lungs, causing cough and nasal congestion. If the Tianfu point is blocked, it indicates a condition beyond cure. </p>
<p>(Note: Internal heat refers to oppressive heat. Restlessness suggests fiery irritability combined with an anxious state. Sneezing results from heat overwhelming the lungs. Cramps in the lower abdomen suggest the Yin energy of the lesser Yin is activated from below. The visible fire indicates the Yang energy rising from above.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If cold and damp are in the abdomen, it leads to diarrhea; when it gains the warmth of fire, the diarrhea stops. The minor yin manifests in both the root and the branch, thus diarrhea occurs intermittently. If the qi moves to the left, it indicates the yang fire rising from the water of the left kidney. If it ascends to the right, it shows the connection between the lungs and kidneys; the kidneys are the root while the lungs are the end. When fire affects the metal of the lungs, it leads to coughing and pain in the skin. Metal governs sound, hence the sudden loss of voice. Pain in the heart is due to self-inflicted fire damage. If one becomes depressed and fails to recognize others, it indicates chaotic cold and heat disturbances above. The sensation of trembling and chills represents the clash of yin and yang. If one feels blocked yet hot, it indicates that the cold of minor yin transforms into heat because of fire, resulting in thirst and a desire to drink. Weakness in the bones suggests that excessive fire leads to diminished energy, while extreme heat results in bone weakness. The small intestine, which is isolated, creates belching when its qi is obstructed, causing the reverse qi to ascend and produce a sound in the heart. The manifestation of red qi indicates a recovery in the five phases, hence water does not freeze. Rash and sores are due to heat harming qi and blood. The intense heat can melt metal, thus the heavenly repository is rendered ineffective. The return of the greater yin sees a transformation of moisture; the body feels heavy and full, food and drink do not digest, the yin qi ascends leading to chest discomfort, and fluid builds up within, resulting in coughing and wheezing sounds.<a id="trans-354p" href="#orig-354p" class="marker">[354p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: Extreme Qi leads to transformation; with excessive dampness, the body feels heavy and full, and food and drink do not digest. In the chest, the area known as &quot;Xuan&quot; is where the ancestral Qi resides; with Yin Qi rising in rebellion, discomfort occurs in the chest. Coughing and wheezing indicate fluid in the lungs. The appearance of scales on land signifies the earth&#39;s collapse. The severe heaviness and pain in the head and neck is attributed to dampness; the head feels wrapped, and since damp heat is not dispelled, the large tendons are short and soft, while the small tendons are elongated and relaxed; short and soft signify stiffness, and relaxed and elongated signify debility. Vomiting occurs due to dampness invading Yangming. Quietness indicates a desire to close the doors and windows and be alone. The chapter on pulses states that wanting to close doors and windows in emptiness indicates an imbalance between Yin and Yang. When Yang is exhausted and Yin is predominant, there is a desire to close off spaces. Yangming refers to the exterior Yang, while Taiyin refers to the three Yin channels. When Yin transforms and invades Yang, Yang tends to diminish while Yin thrives, resulting in the expulsion of clear saliva. In severe cases, it enters the kidneys, leading to the influence of the cold water of winter.]<a id="trans-355p" href="#orig-355p" class="marker">[355p]</a></p></div>

Internal fire erupts, leading to oral sores and vomiting, blood spilling forth. This can lead to intermittents, coupled with chills and trembling; extreme cold can turn to heat, causing dryness in the throat and insatiable thirst for water. The complexion turns yellow-red, and there is diminished strength and a sinking pulse, transforming into water retention, leading to swelling that can progress to the lungs, resulting in coughing and blood loss.

<p>Note: The fire of the lesser yang reemerges in the autumn and winter, hence the dryness and burning. &quot;Insects begin to deplete&quot; refers to withered wood and scorched grass leading to the depletion of insects. Startled spells and bleeding from the heart indicate heat invading the heart and lungs. Aversion to wind signifies heat within both the exterior and interior. A face that looks as if covered with dust indicates slight dulness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the fire energy arises from within, it is the yin fire manifesting internally. If it arises in the upper burner, it results in mouth sores; if in the middle burner, it leads to vomiting and nausea; if in the lower burner, it causes bleeding and diarrhea. When it manifests as malaria, it is governed by the shaoyang, which regulates the dynamics of cold and heat, yin and yang, and the external and internal exchanges. Extreme cold can turn into heat, leading to the transformation of fire. Constriction in the throat indicates injury to the lung&#39;s metal element. Thirst during water intake indicates dryness in the stomach&#39;s metal element governed by yangming. The damp earth of taiyin governs the four bodily energies. When the color turns yellow or red, it signifies the conjunction of fire and earth. If the qi and pulse are weak, both qi and blood are damaged. When it transforms into water, and leads to swelling and lesions, it comes from the interactions of the four energies and five gases culminating in the final qi.</p>
<p>The recovery of yangming involves a significant expulsion of clear qi, as the lush trees grow tall and strong, causing pests to become harmful. Illness arises with abdominal distension and pain; qi returns to the left side, leading to deep sighing, and in severe cases, heart pain along with fullness, abdominal swelling with diarrhea, bitter vomiting, cough, irritability, and headaches. In severe cases, it may affect the liver, causing fright and muscle spasms. If tai chong is blocked, it leads to certain death.</p>
<p>(Note: The commentary explains that the recovery of yangming occurs during its governing period, hence the expulsion of clear qi and the growth of sturdy trees, which leads to abdominal illnesses. The return of qi to the left indicates the interaction of metal and wood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Patients with gallbladder issues tend to sigh heavily, suffer from bitter vomiting, and are affected by wood suffering from the punishment of metal, which also causes sickness in the organs. Coughing up phlegm indicates lung Qi is rebelling. If coughing is accompanied by a feeling of heaviness in the heart, the illness is located in the diaphragm, where the Yangming Qi is reversing. Headaches are associated with the Jueyin disorder. When the ailment causes pain in the ribs, the headache is related to the liver’s meridian Qi; entering the liver can dry out the organ. A dried organ is half alive and half dead; although the pathogen may lightly disturb the organ, if the genuine essence is not harmed, one can still live. However, if the Taichong vessel is severed, the true essence is hurt. The recovery of Jueyin, Shaoyang, Shaoyin, and Taiyin occurs with the changes of the five and six Qi. The resurgence of Yangming and Taiyang corresponds to the Qi from half a year prior, which is why ailments of wood, fire, and earth occur.</p>
<p>The resurgence of Taiyang causes Jue Qi to rise, leading to condensation of water, rain, and ice, resulting in the death of insects. Coldness is generated in the heart and stomach, causing obstruction in the chest and diaphragm; there is pain and fullness in the heart, headaches that induce sadness, occasional dizziness and fainting, reduced appetite, and pain in the lower back that may refer to the heart. The earth cracks and ice forms, while sunlight fails to heal. There may be pain in the lower abdomen and a pulling sensation around the testicles that radiates to the waist and spine, pushing towards the heart. Saliva may turn clear, and there may be belching; in severe cases, it can enter the heart, causing forgetfulness and sadness. If the spirit gate is obstructed, it leads to a condition that is incurable.</p>
<p>(Note: The phrase &quot;Jue Qi rising&quot; refers to the upward movement of stagnant Qi, as it seeks to revert to the conditions of half a year prior.)<a id="trans-358p" href="#orig-358p" class="marker">[358p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Water condenses, with moisture descending. Rain and ice signify coldness above. With cold present above and below, winged insects perish, as cold penetrates and extinguishes warmth. The heart and stomach become cold, causing obstruction in the chest and diaphragm, pain in the heart with fullness, headaches and feelings of sadness, and dizziness leading to fainting, where qi rises from below to the center and then upwards. Eating less leads to fluid overwhelming the earth element. Pain in the lower back and ribs, with difficulty in bending and stretching, arises from cold’s excessive influence causing self-harm. If yang fails to treat, the wood and fire elements weaken. Pain in the lower abdomen affecting the waist and spine that rises to the heart indicates a condition of the jueyin. Spitting clear water and experiencing belching arise from the stomach rising to the heart, reflecting a counteraction from earlier wood, fire, and earth elements of half a year prior.</p>

For the recovery of the taiyang, use salty and warming treatments, complemented by sweet and acrid herbs, and bitterness to strengthen.</p>
<p>In reference to the previous section, it is stated that when expressing heat that does not extend far, it attacks the interior without venturing into coldness. This is similar to the fires of the lesser yang and lesser yin being stagnant and unresolved, which makes it appropriate to release the heat while avoiding a disturbance of coolness. The four types of qi should be cool, while the five should be warm; only when reaching the final qi may heat be applied. One must not disregard the seasonal influences.</p>
<p>In treating various manifestations of recovery: heat should be countered with cold, cold with heat, warm with clarity, and clear with warmth; what disperses should be consolidated, what is restrained should be released, dryness should be moistened, urgency should be soothed, hardness softened, fragility solidified, deficiencies supplemented, and strengths drained.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Spleen, representing Earth, is positioned above the Stomach, which is associated with Metal, while the Yangming is located above the Taiyang Bladder. These represent the three energies of Earth, Metal, and Water, which reside below the midpoint of the body. By naming the upper and lower three energies as Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water, and identifying their existence in the heavens and the earth, we can understand the conditions of the three Yin and three Yang. The midpoint, referred to as the Heavenly Pivot, is located two inches beside the navel, marking the area of the Yangming. This serves to differentiate the upper and lower parts of the body. The term &quot;pivot&quot; signifies the interchanging and rotating nature of the upper and lower energies. Thus, in the realm of heaven and earth, the Heavenly Pivot is named within the interplay of these energies; in the human body, it is named as the midpoint. Therefore, when the upper energies prevail and the lower energies are both afflicted, it is named after the earth; when the lower energies prevail and the upper energies are both afflicted, it is named after the heavens. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the earth, metal, and water of the lower half of the body prevail, while the wood, fire, and qi of the upper half are in a state of illness, this is named after heaven, signifying the illness’s presence in heaven. This is based on the correspondence between the upper and lower parts of the human body and the upper and lower realms of heaven and earth, hence the terminology related to heaven and earth. </p>
<p>Regarding what is referred to as &quot;arrival of victory,&quot; this means that the retaliatory qi is subdued and has yet to manifest. When it returns, it is not named differently than heaven and earth; it operates according to the principle of returning qi. </p>
<p>This refers to the returning qi of the upper and lower aspects. When victory arrives, the retaliatory qi is subdued in its original state and not yet released; when it returns, it acts like returning qi and does not require different names based on heaven and earth. For instance, in the case of the lesser yin, lesser yang, and so on, when their qi manifests in relation to the four and five phases, the yangming and taiyang cycles cause their qi to return to initial energies of wood and fire. Thus, it is unnecessary to designate wood and fire to the upper half of the year and name it after heaven; rather, metal and water, governing the lower half of the year, are named after earth. Everything is based on the location of the returning qi and the established principle.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;Is the movement of victory and return constant with time? Is it necessary for qi to be so?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There is a constant position in time, but qi is not necessarily fixed.&quot; The Emperor expressed his desire to understand the way. Qi Bo explained: &quot;Initial qi culminates in the three qi, governed by heavenly qi, which is the constancy of victory.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor asked, &quot;Is the qi of victory and recovery in accordance with the fixed positions of the four seasons? Can this qi move according to the inevitability of the four seasons?&quot; Bo said, &quot;The wood, fire, earth, metal, and water of the four seasons have their predetermined locations, but the qi of victory and recovery does not emerge from its principal position; therefore, it cannot be certain. It is said that each of the six qi governs a year, and if the qi of that year is victorious, it will emerge as spring approaches, guided by the qi of Taiyin, Yangming, and Taiyang, all of which arise in spring and summer. As for the return of the six qi, they manifest only after they have reached their peak, hence they emerge after the middle of the year, where the recovery of Jueyin, Shaoyin, and Shaoyang occurs in autumn and winter. Thus, it is said that the initial qi lasts for three periods, governed by the heavenly qi, and this is the norm of victory. The four qi reach their conclusion with the ending qi, which is governed by the earthly qi, and this is the norm of recovery. Where there is victory, there is recovery; where there is no victory, there is none. Therefore, the qi of victory and recovery does not adhere strictly to the fixed positions of the four seasons and cannot be deemed certain.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said, &quot;Good. What happens after recovery and victory?&quot; Qibo replied, &quot;When victory arrives, recovery follows, but there are no fixed numbers; only when decline occurs does it cease. If recovery occurs and then victory does not return, it is harmful. This injures life.&quot;</p>
<p>This clarifies that where there is victory, recovery continues indefinitely, but it must await the decline of the victorious qi before it can stop.<a id="trans-364p" href="#orig-364p" class="marker">[364p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The restoration of balance leads to victory; just as the fire element, having regained its strength, overcomes metal, metal then regains its strength and overcomes fire in turn. This cycle of overcoming and restoring is variable, without fixed patterns, only ceasing when the overpowering energy diminishes. Hence, when the restorative energy manifests, it can also gain the upper hand. If fire, re-establishing itself, overcomes metal, then metal must also regain its strength. If it fails to regain strength, metal will suffer harm from fire, thus injuring its vitality. Therefore, one must wait for the decline of power before balance is achieved; wherever there is overcoming, there is also restoration.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;What is the illness of restoration and reversal?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;It is due to occupying an improper position, leading to disharmony. When restoration achieves dominance, then its master prevails, hence the reversal of illness, which is characterized by heat and dryness associated with fire.&quot;</p>
<p>The reversal of restoration refers specifically to the illness stemming from the restorative energy. For example, when fire regains strength and dominates the metal position, the metal energy likewise regains its strength and dominates fire&#39;s position; both are out of place and thus fail to harmonize. Therefore, when restoration achieves dominance, its master prevails, resulting in the reversal of illness. When fire&#39;s energy strongly dominates in Yangming, the main energies of the five positions overpower it; similarly, when metal&#39;s energy strongly dominates in Shaoyin, the main energies of the two positions overpower it. This illustrates the illness of the restorative energy, characterized by the heat and dryness of fire.<a id="trans-365p" href="#orig-365p" class="marker">[365p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The remaining Qi behaves in this manner. When the victorious Qi returns, it revives; when the victorious Qi wanes, it ceases. The Qi of victory and revival is suitable for gradual decline, but not for a great resurgence. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked, &quot;How should it be governed?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the Qi is victorious, the subtle ones follow it, and the extreme ones are restrained. When the Qi revives, the harmonious ones are balanced, and the violent ones are subdued. All conform to the victorious Qi, ensuring their submission. Without concern for their numbers, the goal is to achieve balance. This is the way.&quot;</p>
<p>The commentary states: &quot;The subtle ones follow it, adapting to its Qi for adjustment. The extreme ones are restrained, controlled by what they fear. The harmonious ones are balanced, moderating the subtle. The wayward and violent are subdued, their strength diminished. But by merely following the victorious Qi, the Qi of submission will be naturally at peace. There is no need to inquire about the fluctuations of victory and revival; only establishing balance in Qi is the goal. This is the method of governing victory and revival.&quot;</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> The guest qi refers to the energies governed by the heavens, located between the springs and their surroundings, one of the six energies of heaven. Heaven encompasses the earth, and from beneath the springs, the six energies circulate, reflecting the way of heaven. The main qi pertains to the positioning of the five directions and four seasons, embodying the way of the earth. Kun (the earth) follows heaven, thus the main qi overcomes the guest qi in opposition, while the guest qi follows in compliance, aligning with the way of heaven.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What are the symptoms of life-threatening illnesses?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;When the Jueyin (Liver) governs the heavens, if the guest qi prevails, there will be ringing in the ears and dizziness, and in severe cases, coughing; if the main qi prevails, there will be pain in the chest and flanks, and difficulty in speaking.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the guest qi of wind and wood prevails from above, it causes ringing in the ears and dizziness. The Jueyin liver is linked to the lungs through the diaphragm. In severe cases, coughing indicates the excess qi entering the meridians. When the main qi prevails, it results in pain in the chest and flanks, as the liver meridian spreads through these areas. The Jueyin and Shaoyang govern tendons; when the two meridians are afflicted, the tongue curls, leading to difficulty in speaking. Guest qi descends from above, while main qi ascends from within.</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin (Heart) governs the heavens, if the guest qi prevails, there will be sneezing, stiff neck, heat in the shoulders and back, headaches, shortness of breath with fever, deafness and closed eyes, and in severe cases, swelling, blood leakage, sores, and cough-induced wheezing; if the main qi prevails, there will be heart heat and irritability, and in severe cases, pain and fullness in the flanks.<a id="trans-367p" href="#orig-367p" class="marker">[367p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes</strong>:<br>In the Lesser Yin phase of heaven, the initial energy is the cold water of the Greater Yang, the second energy is the wind and wood of the Jue Yin, and the third energy is the fire of the Lesser Yin. Symptoms such as sneezing, deafness, and closed eyes indicate an excess of Jue Yin energy. Symptoms like stiff neck, shoulder and back heat, and headaches, especially severe cases leading to swelling, indicate an excess of the cold water energy of the Greater Yang. Mild energy surges with fever, blood overflow in sores or coughing and wheezing indicate an excess of the fire energy of the monarch. The initial controlling energy is the wind and wood of Jue Yin, the second energy is the monarch fire, and the third energy is the mutual fire. When the controlling energy prevails, it results in heart heat and restlessness, indicating the dominance of both monarch and mutual fire energies. In severe cases, pain in the ribs and fullness indicates an excess of Jue Yin&#39;s initial energy. This is attributed to the monarch fire governing the year, hence the supremacy of fire, which can lead to Jue Yin symptoms. </p>
<p>In the Greater Yin phase of heaven, when the external energy prevails, symptoms include swelling in the head and face, along with respiratory distress. When the internal energy prevails, it results in fullness in the chest and abdomen, leading to restlessness post meals. </p>

Respiratory distress indicates dampness affecting the internal organs. When the internal energy prevails, fullness in the chest and abdomen indicates that the initial energy of wood overwhelms and injures the earth element. According to the classics, the lungs are affected by severe external illnesses, leading to a condition where both hands are crossed, signaling the interrelation of the second and third energies’ fire, resulting in lung diseases.<a id="trans-368p" href="#orig-368p" class="marker">[368p]</a></p></div>

Vomiting and internal disturbances arise from the convergence of damp and earthy energies. Symptoms such as sores and throat swelling develop due to damp-heat; these conditions originate from above and descend from the outside to the inside. The lungs, which cover the heart, exhibit symptoms related to chest fullness and cough, wherein the dual fires of vital energy rise and seek external release. Difficulty in breathing indicates lung illness preventing rest. Severe symptoms include blood and hot hands, indicating fire emerging externally.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Next, the guest Qi is that of the cold water of the sun. The sun governs the vital energy of all Yang; the Yang energy, when gentle, nourishes the tendons. If the cold energy lingers within, the sun experiences it, leading to internal conditions of spasm and rigidity, known as the stubbornness of sinew and muscle. The guest Qi at the end pertains to the wind and wood of the spring, thus the external manifestation is one of inconvenience. Inconvenience also implies a disadvantage to the sinews and bones. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: &quot;The bones are loose, the joints are slack and do not gather.&quot; What is referred to as bone looseness is actually excessive movement.</p>
<p>In the vital energy of spring, the Taiyin governs the moist earth, the Yangming governs the dry metal, and the sun governs the cold water. If the sinews and bones become loose alongside waist and abdominal pain, this indicates illness arising from the interaction of the three energies.</p>

<p>The guest Qi of the four is that of the cold water of the sun, hence the waist, buttocks, thighs, and legs are affected; this is a manifestation of the sun channel&#39;s condition in relation to similar energies. The next guest Qi is that of the Jueyin wind and wood, leading to dizziness, heat, sourness, and swelling impeding standing, indicating the condition of the spleen’s earth, as wood excess causes the earth to suffer.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The transformation of urine and stool is caused by the interplay of water and fire, with fire manifesting below. When the primary force is strong, the qi rises; when there is heart pain and heat, it is due to the governing qi of cold water rising above, overpowering the monarch fire at the spring. The primary force of the fifth is the dry metal of Yangming, while the guest qi is the wind wood of Jueyin. Various obstructions exist in their respective places, some worsen and then cease, some reside and then rise, with right responding to left and left to right. Various obstructions in the diaphragm arise from the sides, as the qi of Yangming conquers the meridian of Jueyin. The primary force of the fourth is the damp earth of Taiyin, while the guest qi is the cold water of Taiyang. The po sweat is the exterior sweat. Sweat is the yin fluid. The bladder is where fluids are stored. If there is reverse movement, it is the earth qi rising. By earth overcoming water, fluids are not stored, and sweat emerges on the surface.</p>

If the primary force is strong, there will be a reversal of cold qi, a fullness that restricts food and drink intake, potentially leading to hernias.</p>

The governing qi of the end is the cold water of the Yangming, while the guest qi is the damp earth of the Tian (Heaven); therefore, when the governing qi is strong, the cold qi reverses upward. This occurs because the water overabundance ascends and overpowers the earth, leading to a reversal.</p>
<p>The governing qi of the Four Directions is the damp earth of the Taiyin, while the guest qi represents the wind wood of the Jueyin. When food and drink are not taken, it may lead to hernias when the damp qi rises upward and affects the channels of the Jueyin.

The situation of the Shaoyin is similar.</p>
<p>(Note: The notes clarify that when the Shaoyang is in the spring, the initial guest qi is the fire of the Shaoyin, with the governing qi as the damp earth of the Taiyin. Subsequently, the guest qi becomes the damp earth of the Taiyin, with the governing qi as the dry metal of the Yangming. Finally, the guest qi becomes the fire of the Shaoyang, while the governing qi is the cold water of the Taiyang. Pain in the waist and abdomen with adverse cold indicates that the guest is strong and the governing qi of the Taiyang is ill.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In severe cases, the presence of white in urine indicates an issue with the Yangming and Taiyin vital energies. The vital energy of Metal, when transformed, results in urination. White urine signifies that the energy is not transforming properly, causing unclear urine. The presence of white stools indicates that the Earth energy is damaged, resulting in pale feces. When the guest energy overcomes the host energy, it causes the latter to rebel, hence the term &quot;rebel.&quot; When the host energy prevails, the heat reverses and ascends, affecting the heart. Heart pain accompanied by fever indicates that the guest energy of the two types of fire also ascends and causes disease. If one experiences nausea and vomiting, it signals that the guest energy of the Taiyin is ill. When the host prevails and the guest energy rebels, this is referred to as &quot;rebel&quot; or &quot;guest,&quot; and the lesser Yin corresponds. The nature of fire is to rise, which is why both types of fire can cause a rebellious state leading to disease.</p>
<p>When Yangming is in the source, if the guest energy prevails, the clear energy moves downward, leading to a hard and full lower abdomen with frequent diarrhea. If the host energy prevails, there is a sensation of heaviness in the waist and abdominal pain, and the lower abdomen feels cold. If this leads to watery diarrhea, there is a cold sensation in the intestines that ascends to the chest, and in severe cases, it results in difficulty breathing and an inability to stand for long periods.</p>
<p>Notes: The movement of clear energy downward signifies the impact of the crisp and cool Qi in the lower region. Hard and full lower abdomen with frequent diarrhea indicates an illness related to the cold water of the Sun. Host energy prevailing results in a heavy waist and abdominal pain, and the cold sensation in the lower abdomen arises from the cold water energy of the Sun manifesting downward.<a id="trans-374p" href="#orig-374p" class="marker">[374p]</a></p></div>

<p>This refers to the wood position governed by the jueyin. This is an unchanging position of the four seasons. If the season has not yet reached its peak, but the energy of early spring arrives first, this abundant energy should be drained with sourness. If it has arrived but is not yet at its peak, this waning energy should be supplemented with spiciness. The nature of wood is to rise; sourness counteracts its nature and constrains it, hence it is draining. Spiciness supports and promotes its rising energy, thus it is supplementary.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five phases of qi: when a refreshing air arrives late, this is an indication of the intensity of the qi. For relief, it is appropriate to use pungent flavors, as they disperse it. If the heat persists well into autumn, this indicates an insufficiency of qi. In this case, sour flavors should be used for nourishment, as they help to contain it.</p>
<p>The master of water corresponds to salty flavors for relief and bitter flavors for nourishment.</p>
<p>The terminal phase of qi: when the weather is bitterly cold with ice, snow, and hail, this signifies a heightened state of qi. Salty flavors should be used for relief because they can help to drain it, aligning with its nature. If the weather remains warm despite this phase, it indicates an insufficiency of qi. Therefore, it is beneficial to nourish with bitter flavors since bitterness is cold and helps elevate the dampness associated with heat, supporting the foundational essence of yang. This is referred to as balancing with the proper flavors to achieve harmony, preventing seasonal imbalances from becoming ailments for the populace.</p>
<p>In the case of the guest of jueyin, one should nourish with pungent flavors, relieve with sour flavors, and moderate with sweet flavors.</p>
<p>This also applies to the six phases influenced by external factors, where there are appropriate flavors for both excess and deficiency. The six phases operate without fixed locations, resembling guests arriving from outside, hence the term &quot;guest.&quot; It is customary to observe this during the early dawn of the first day of the lunar month. If qi arrives insufficiently, pungent flavors should be used for nourishment; if qi is overly abundant, sour flavors should be used for relief, moderated by sweet flavors. According to the doctrine concerning the internal organs: when the liver is imbalanced and bitter, consuming sweet flavors can help alleviate it. Hence, when qi is abundant, it flows outward; if excess guest qi exists, it remains within, necessitating the combination of flavors desired by the five internal organs to bring balance.</p>
<p>For the guest of shaoyin, one should nourish with salty flavors, relieve with sweet flavors, and contain with salty flavors.<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a></p></div>

In the eighth month, it represents the Taiyin of the right foot. In the eleventh month, it represents the Taiyin of the left foot. In the ninth month, it represents the Jueyin of the right foot.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The root cause lies in addressing the location of the illness. The main principle states: one ruler and two subjects constitute an odd system; two rulers and four subjects form an even system; two rulers and three subjects create an odd system; two rulers and six subjects define an even system.</p>
<p>In notes, the main principle refers to the essence of numbers. Numbers begin with one and achieve completeness with three, representing the circle. By pairing two, they form six, symbolizing the square. Earth is represented by the number two, and wood by three; when甲 (jia) and己 (ji) combine, soil is transformed. Two rulers and six subjects align with the positions of heaven and earth, forming the eight trigrams. When it is less than two, it begins with the yin number; when it is more than nine, it concludes with the yang number.</p>
<p>Thus, it is said: treat those close with odd methods, and those far with even methods. Addressing sweating does not use odd methods, and treating the lower does not employ even methods. To treat those above with a calming approach, and those below with urgency, is the way to proceed. Urgency leads to denser energy, while calmness results in lighter energy. Properly addressing the specific location of the ailment is the key here. </p>
<p>Notes: Odd and even refer to the numbers of heaven and earth. &quot;Close&quot; means the illness is at the top and near, hence odd methods are used to treat it, as weather exists above. &quot;Far&quot; indicates the illness is below and distant, so even methods are employed, reflecting the earth&#39;s energy below.<a id="trans-383p" href="#orig-383p" class="marker">[383p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sweat is the yin fluid, thus it is used in pairs rather than in singles; this is because it rises directly from below to allow it to ascend, similar to how the earth&#39;s qi rises before forming clouds and rain. When there is a need to descend, the single is used rather than the pair, as this comes from above to descend in response to the downward movement of heavenly qi. </p>
<p>The補 (bu) refers to replenishing the deficiency of vital qi, while 治 (zhi) refers to addressing the excess of pathogenic qi. Those above should be treated with slow methods, while those below require urgent approaches. For urgent cases, use heavier flavors, while for slower cases, use lighter flavors, as the heavy flavors are dense and easily descend, while lighter flavors are light and clear, allowing them to rise. The pair and single, slow and urgent, should be adapted to their respective positions above or below, down to the specific location of the illness.</p>
<p>For illnesses that are distant, measured flavors should be consumed in moderation without exceeding their prescribed limits. Therefore, the method of balancing qi is near and with pairs and singles, which requires smaller quantities of food. For distant cases, it is near and uses larger quantities of food. Larger quantities imply fewer items, while smaller quantities imply more items. More items total nine, while fewer items total two.</p>
<p>(Note: This explains the movement of flavors from the center to the top and bottom. When the illness is distant, it refers to an illness located above or below but distant from the central stomach. The measured flavors from the center signify that flavors move accordingly up and down, thus they should be used in conjunction with both medicine and food in prescribed amounts.)<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the illness is located above and distant from the center, one should first consume food and then take medicine. If the illness is below and distant from the center, one should first take medicine and then eat. This is based on the principle of the sequence of food and medicine, ensuring that the flavors of the medicine do not interfere with food in terms of their positioning. Therefore, when the illnesses are located above or below and are close to the central pathway, using unique and general methods requires smaller dosages. When the illness is far from the center and involves unique and general treatments, it is appropriate to use larger dosages. The terms &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; in dosages refer to their relative lightness and heaviness. Larger doses should be given in fewer numbers with more extensive applications, as they are potent and effective over greater distances. Smaller doses should be given in larger numbers with more limited applications, as their potency is diluted and cannot reach far. This reflects the pathway of the three energies: upper, middle, and lower. </p>
<p>When the unique does not dissipate, then it is accompanied by the general, which is called a heavier prescription. When the general does not dissipate, it is countered and supplemented to be effective. The concepts of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness should align with the nature of the illness viewed in the context of the seasons. The emperor said: &quot;Good. I understand that an illness arises from its origin.” he continued, &quot;But what about illnesses that arise from superficial causes?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;Illness reflects its origin and results in symptoms that are superficial.&quot;<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat the root, one must address the symptoms. </p>
<p>(Note: This discussion pertains to the relationship between the three yin and three yang, distinguishing between the root and the symptoms. Illness arising from the root comes from wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, or fire. Illness arising from the symptoms comes from the qi of the three yin and three yang. For example, the sun is the chief of all yang, rooted in cold water; the lesser yin is the greatest of the yin in the midst of yin and is rooted in the fire of the lord; yangming represents the flourishing qi of yang, rooted in clarity and coolness; and jueyin governs extreme yin, which is rooted in the yang of wind and wood. Within the categories of yin and yang, there exists a distinction between root and symptom. When illness reflects the root, for instance, a cold condition might ironically lead to the warmth of the sun; a hot condition might reflect the coolness of the lesser yin; a yang condition could reveal a deficiency in clarity and coolness; and a yin condition could unexpectedly manifest in fire and heat. This notion of illness reflecting the root deals with symptoms arising from that illness. Treating in opposition to the root means that if the actual condition is cold yet manifests warmth, one should counteract heat with cooling medicines; conversely, if the root condition is hot yet shows coldness, one should apply warming medicines to address cold; if the condition lies in yangming and presents with virtual cold, then one should invigorate the inner qi; if the condition is in jueyin and exhibits fire and heat, treatment must reverse to address the lesser yang. Therefore, treatment that opposes the root follows the symptom. Both lesser yang and lesser yin are similar in terms of root and symptom, both deriving treatment from yang heat and yin dampness.) </p>

<p>The Emperor asked: What is the pulse like when these conditions manifest?

<p>[Note: This discusses how the six climatic influences correspond to the six pulses. Jueyin governs wood, thus its pulse is string-like. Shaoyin governs fire, hence its pulse is hook-like. Taiyin governs earth, resulting in a deep pulse. Shaoyang also governs fire, producing a large and floating pulse. Yangming governs metal, leading to a short and wiry pulse.

<p>When these conditions arrive harmoniously, they bring balance; when they become excessive, they lead to illness.

<p>The Emperor said: &quot;The six atmospheric influences (qi) differ in their sources and manifestations; how then do they relate?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There are those that arise from the fundamental source, those that arise from manifest signs and sources, and those that do not arise from manifest sources.&quot; The Emperor requested to hear more. Qi Bo explained: &quot;The Shao Yang and Tai Yin arise from the fundamental source; the Shao Yin and Tai Yang arise both from the fundamental source and from signs; the Yang Ming and Jue Yin do not arise from the manifestations but from the center. Therefore, those that arise from the fundamental source are generated from the root; those from signs have transformations associated with those signs; and those that come from the center are transformed by the central qi.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The six atmospheric influences are wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire as the fundamental source, whereas the three Yin and three Yang are considered manifestations. Those with Yin dampness but observe the Tai Yin&#39;s Yin, and those with the initial Yang&#39;s fire yet observe the Shao Yang&#39;s Yang, represent the transformation from the fundamental source, thus Tai Yin and Shao Yang stem from the root. The Shao Yin&#39;s fundamental heat shows as the Shao Yin&#39;s Yin, the Tai Yang&#39;s fundamental cold shows as the Tai Yang&#39;s Yang; within Yin is Yang, and within Yang is Yin, thus existing are the transformations of water, fire, cold, and heat, hence the Shao Yin and Tai Yang stem from the fundamental source as well as from signs. Above the Yang Ming, the drying influences govern, revealing the Tai Yin; above the Jue Yin, the windy influences govern, revealing the Shao Yang.)<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yang Ming governs the autumn of the four seasons, while the Tai Yin presides over the clear autumn of the four qi. The Jue Yin corresponds to the intersection of two yin, where yin is exhausted and one yang begins to emerge; thus, Yang Ming and Jue Yin manifest transformations from within. The Emperor asked: If the pulse indicates a reverse condition, what is the diagnosis? Qi Bo replied: When the pulse is present, following it, and pressing does not produce a response, this is true for all yang diseases. The Emperor continued: How is the pulse for all yin reversals? Qi Bo said: When the pulse is present, following it, pressing causes a strong response and is vigorous. </p>
<p>(Note: This discusses pulse diagnosis, which has both superficial and underlying aspects. When the pulse follows, it indicates a yang condition with a yang pulse or a yin condition with a yin pulse. For example, in the case of Tai Yang or Yang Ming illness, if the pulse is present and floating, that is a sign of a superficial condition. If the illness reverses into yin cold, the Tai Yang condition transforms from the surface, and the Yang Ming condition reveals a transformation into yin, hence though the pulse is floating, it does not respond strongly upon pressing. In cases of Shao Yin or Jue Yin illness, if the pulse is present and sinking, that indicates a deeper condition. If the illness reverses into yang heat, the Shao Yin condition transforms from the surface, and the Jue Yin condition reveals a transformation into fire, thus although the pulse is sinking, it responds strongly upon pressing. This highlights the transformation of yin and yang in the pulse and the distinction between the superficial and underlying aspects of illness.)<a id="trans-391p" href="#orig-391p" class="marker">[391p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of illness caused by the Taiyang (greater yang), symptoms include headache, fever, and unquenchable thirst; these are the root manifestations of Taiyang disease. If there are symptoms such as cramping in the hands and feet or deep pulse with sweating, these represent the superficial manifestations of Taiyang disease. For Shaoyin (lesser yin) illness, if the pulse is deep, one should warm it urgently with Sijunzi Decoction; this represents the superficial manifestation of Shaoyin disease. If, after two to three days of Shaoyin disease, one experiences dry mouth and throat, urgent purgation is needed, and Dachengqi Decoction should be used; this is the root manifestation of Shaoyin disease. In cases of Yangming (yang brightness) disease, there are fever and thirst along with dry and constipated stools; these symptoms are the outward signs of Yangming disease. If there is a cold and empty sensation in the stomach, food does not digest, there is a desire to vomit, and the pulse is slow with aversion to cold, this indicates Yangming disease influenced by internal dampness. In cases of Jueyin (reverting yin) disease, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, this reflects the inward manifestations of Jueyin disease. If there is diabetes with upward-rebounding qi impacting the heart, causing heat and pain in the heart, this indicates Jueyin influenced by the fire of Shaoyang. For Taiyin (greater yin), with its superficial manifestations being cold and its root being dampness, it should be treated with Sijunzi and similar remedies. Shaoyang, with its superficial manifestations being hot and its root being fire, should be dispersed with cool remedies. In treating cold damage and the diseases of the six channels, one must consider the superficial and deep aspects; in doing so, one is already halfway to understanding. </p>
<p>Therefore, the origins of all diseases can arise from the root, the superficial level, or from the middle qi. Some illnesses derive from the root, others from the superficial level, or from the middle qi; some are obtained from the superficial level, others from the root, or from the combination of both.<a id="trans-392p" href="#orig-392p" class="marker">[392p]</a></p></div>

If it penetrates internally, it may lead to sudden illness or vomiting, or result in cold limbs and internal cold, as it deals with the transformation of the energies of yin and yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is struck in the viscera, one may collapse suddenly and not recognize others; if struck in the organs, one’s tongue will become difficult to speak and the mouth will drool saliva. Similarly, in the case of cold damage, it is the evil of the heavens; one may be affected by yin or by yang. There are those who are struck by yang and exhibit symptoms of cold, and those who are struck by yin and exhibit symptoms of heat. This reflects the intermingling of yin and yang within our bodies and the transformation of their energies at the fundamental level. If one is affected by the dampness within the body, it results in symptoms related to Qinglong or Wuling; if one is affected by dryness and heat, then prescriptions like Baitou and Chengqi should be applied. This merely reflects the external evil of heaven, while the inner dynamics with their varying transformations of yin and yang also come into play.</p>
<p>Moreover, during summer illnesses, if there are cold extremities, symptoms resembling those treated by ginger, cinnamon, ginseng, and licorice will arise, because the yang energy of summer has fully emerged outward while the inner energy is originally weak. When subjected to wind and heat from the heavens, it may transform into yin and cold, demonstrating the dynamic changes within our bodies, not a direct result of summer heat causing a cold illness. Thus, adept practitioners understand how fundamental and symptomatic diseases arise, recognizing the transformation of energies. By understanding these transformations, they can effectively apply treatment methods that address both symptoms and root causes. Hence, knowing how to distinguish between symptoms and root causes allows for effective treatment without peril, clearly discerning the nature of things, and proceeding correctly regardless of the situation. This is the principle: treat cold with heat and heat with cold.<a id="trans-394p" href="#orig-394p" class="marker">[394p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore it is said, reversing is the same as following. Those who follow treat heat with heat and cold with cold, hence it is said to follow; reversing is the opposite. Within the dynamics of yin and yang, cold and heat, there are also conditions where heat manifests as cold, such as in cases of deep heat presenting as deep cold. Similarly, there are conditions where cold manifests as heat, such as when one removes clothing to enter the water, signifying the solitary yang escaping from the body, needing urgent nourishment from the yin. Amateur practitioners, in their folly, believe they understand; they claim the heat has not yet subsided, while the cold illness resumes, mistaking similar manifestations as identical, thus confusing diagnoses and disrupting the patterns. This is what is meant.</p>
<p>The essence of understanding the relationship between the surface and the root is that it is fundamental yet extensive, small yet significant; knowing one can lead to the understanding of a hundred ailments. Speaking of the surface and the root, they should be approached with ease and without loss. Observing the root and the surface allows for the harmonization of qi. Clear knowledge leads to victory and renewal, serving as a model for all people. This is the complete way of heaven.</p>
<p>[Note: This emphasizes the application of the relationship between surface and root. The principle of their relationship may be succinct, but its application is profound; though it may seem minor, its significance is vast. Knowing the relationship between surface and root allows for the understanding of the harms of a hundred ailments.]<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The principles of treatment should be straightforward and cause no harm, observing both the root and branches, even if the six energies change, can still be balanced. To understand the interaction between root and branches is sufficient to set a standard for the people, for the six energies follow the way of heaven. The Emperor asked: How does the change between dominance and recovery manifest in early versus late stages? Qibo replied: The one that is dominant indicates that illness has reached a critical point, with distress already present while recovery is just beginning. The one that is recovering shows that dominance has ended and has risen, taking on a significant position. Dominance can vary in intensity, and recovery can vary in quantity. When dominance is harmonized it achieves balance, and when dominance is vacuous, it becomes void. This is the constancy of heaven. The Emperor asked: What occurs when the process of dominance and recovery is misaligned or delayed? Qibo replied: The generation and transformation of qi exhibit different patterns of flourishing and declining. The uses of heat and cold vary across the four seasons. Thus, the movement of yang begins with warmth and flourishes in summer; the movement of yin begins with clarity and flourishes in winter. Each of spring, summer, autumn, and winter has its distinct allocations. Hence, it is said: The warmth of spring prepares for the heat of summer; the anger of autumn prepares for the fury of winter. By carefully observing the four dimensions, all scouts return. The end can be seen, and the beginning can be known. This is what is meant. The Emperor asked: Are there specific differences? Qibo replied: In total, there are thirty degrees.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From the supportive to the righteous, and from the righteous to the supportive, cold and warmth interchange, cool and hot energies intersect. The dynamics of success and decline are both abundant and minimal, following the seasons in their order, resulting in early and late appearances. The movement of yang begins with warmth and peaks in heat; the movement of yin starts with clarity and peaks in cold. This transitions from subtlety to intensity. Just as spring is subdued, summer is harmonious, autumn is numerical, and winter is waning. The residual energies of winter still interact with spring, those of spring with summer, summer with autumn, and autumn with winter, resulting in a transition from abundance to subtlety. The so-called &#39;just&#39; refers to the proper alignment of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The &#39;support&#39; refers to the transitions between spring and summer, summer and autumn, autumn and winter, winter and spring—a dimensional framework in four corners. The energies of the four seasons arise from the supportive to the righteous, and then return from the righteous to the supportive, with cold and warmth intersecting and cool and hot alternating, continuously cycling without end. Thus, when prosperity arrives, it may bring illness; when illness recedes, it may rekindle, indicating the resurgence of energy at a time of prosperity. For instance, in spring, there may be the harsh defeat of the sapling by metal energy. In summer, there may be the overpowering heat of fire overcoming metal.<a id="trans-397p" href="#orig-397p" class="marker">[397p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fiery energy has already begun to stir during the time of excessive illness; this is the restoration of energy emerging early at the primary position of thirty degrees. The restorative energy waits until the excessive energy has dissipated, then it rises in the sweltering heat of summer at its primary position, hence both the excessive energy arises earlier and the restorative energy follows suit. Therefore, when the excessive energy is strong, the restorative energy is abundant; when the excessive energy is mild, the restorative energy is scarce; when the excessive energy is balanced, the restorative energy is also balanced; when the excessive energy is weak and declining, the restorative energy is likewise weak and declining. This is the constant of the way of nature. If the emergence of excessive and restorative energies is out of proper order and arrives late, it is due to the tardiness of the excessive and restorative energies. The birth of energy occurs at the interaction of the preceding energies, just as summer energy arises during late spring. The transformation of energy occurs at the interaction of the subsequent energies, like spring energy flowing into early summer. The energies of excess and restoration vary in strength and decline; thus, there are distinctions of early and late. Indeed, vigorous energy arises from the thirty degrees born prior to the primary position, while weak energy flows post the primary position&#39;s transformation of thirty degrees; hence, it does not align with its position. If the metal energy weakens and is excessive at the turn of spring and summer, then the restorative energy will also weaken, and its restoration during the turn of summer and autumn indicates a void in excess, arriving late. The energies of the four seasons interact; therefore, the fluctuations of excessive and restorative energies follow the exchanges of the seasonal energies, appearing either early or late. Thus, it is said that the application of prosperity and decline is within the four dimensions.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said, attentively observing the four seasons, that all responses return; their end can be seen, and their beginning can be known. This means that the early and late victories both pertain to the responses of the four seasons, either early by thirty degrees before the beginning, or late by thirty degrees after the end. The emperor asked: How should the pulse respond? Qibo replied: It differs slightly from the proper method, waiting for the right moment to depart.</p>
<p>(Note: This further uses the pulse state to prove the interaction of qi transformation, therefore it is called &quot;Four Seals.&quot; If the qi of spring, summer, autumn, and winter do not interact, then the qi of heaven and earth across the four seasons is all blocked. The &quot;proper&quot; refers to the correct positions of the four seasons. It indicates that the pulse aligns with the proper methods of the four seasons, intersecting before and after. Waiting for the right moment to depart means departing after thirty degrees of the end. For instance, in spring, if it remains dormant, it still belongs to the qi of winter interacting, until the thirtieth day of the last month, at which point spring qi begins to take command alone.) </p>
<p>The essentials of the pulse state are: spring does not allow for unfurling, summer does not sustain, winter does not stagnate, autumn does not enumerate, which is called &quot;Four Seals.&quot;<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If spring does not anchor, then winter&#39;s energy does not interact with spring; if summer does not resonate, then spring&#39;s energy does not interact with summer; if autumn does not count, then summer&#39;s energy does not interact with autumn; if winter does not flow, then autumn&#39;s energy does not interact with winter. This indicates that the energies of the four seasons do not connect and are obstructed.</p>
<p>Excessive anchoring is called illness, excessive resonance is called illness, excessive flowing is called illness, excessive counting is called illness. Seeing in pairs is called illness; seeing again is called illness. Departing without truly departing is called illness; departing yet remaining is called illness. Reversal indicates death. Thus, it is said, the energies must uphold their roles, just as scales must not lose balance.</p>
<p>The energies of yin and yang require clarity and tranquility for transformation and governance; movement leads to harsh diseases. This is what is meant. The energies of the four seasons are strongest when they are at their primary positions, weak at the beginning of emergence, and faded during conversion; thus, excessive amounts lead to illness. Seeing in pairs refers to the anchoring and resonance occurring together at the beginning of spring, or the resonance and counting together at the beginning of summer. Seeing again means that which has departed returns. Departing without departing means leaving before the thirty-day mark. Departing yet not departing means that one has reached thirty days and should depart but does not. Reversal refers to the problematic pulses visible in the changing seasons.</p>
<p>Thus, it is said, the energies must uphold their roles, just as scales must not become unbalanced. The energies of the four seasons, when maintained in their proper positions and interacting as they should, are like weights not being able to separate. The energies of yin and yang in the four seasons require clarity and tranquility for generation and transformation. Generation occurs first, followed by transformation.

The pairing of darkness and brightness corresponds to the differences between cold and heat. </p>
<p>[Note: Darkness and brightness refer to yin and yang. The convergence of the two yins denotes the extreme of yin, hence it is called darkness. The coming together of the two yangs signifies the extreme of yang, hence it is called brightness. When yin reaches its peak, yang is born; when yang reaches its peak, yin is born.

This signifies the correct order of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;Qi arrival&quot; refers to the two solstices of winter and summer, while &quot;qi division&quot; pertains to the two equinoxes of spring and autumn.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Five Movements and Six Qis are the regular principles of the rise and fall of Yin and Yang in heaven and earth. The flow of the Five Movements has disparities of excess and deficiency; the rise and fall of the Six Qis has differences between opposition and compliance. Anything not aligned with the virtue and governance of the state leads to calamities that can afflict people. Therefore, these are called the seasonal energies.</p>
<p>The Ten Heavenly Stems paired together form the Five Movements:</p>
<p>Jia and Ji combine to create the Earth Movement; Jia, the firm Wood, overcomes Ji, the yielding Earth.<br>Yi and Geng combine to create the Metal Movement; Yi, the yielding Wood, unites with Geng, the firm Metal.<br>Ding and Ren combine to create the Wood Movement; Ding, the Yin Fire, pairs with Ren, the Yang Water.<br>Bing and Xin combine to create the Water Movement; Bing, the Yang Fire, marries Xin, the yielding Metal.<br>Wu and Gui combine to create the Fire Movement; Wu, the Yang Soil, marries Gui, the Yin Water.</p>
<p>The excess and deficiency of the Five Movements:</p>
<p>The Yang firm husband represents excess, while the Yin yielding wife represents deficiency; this is a brief explanation. Every sixty years culminates in the cycle of Jia-Zi, where there are seasonal movements controlled by heaven called the Celestial Symbol and linked to the earthly branches known as the Annual Assembly. The Meng Year is also referred to as the Branch Virtue Symbol. When the annual movement governs the Earth, the firm represents the Celestial Symbol, while the yielding signifies the Annual Assembly. There are twenty-nine such years in total. Excess directed by heaven, termed Heavenly Punishment. On the day of major cold at the intersection of energies, those whose timings and movements pair as husband and wife are called the Cosmic Virtue Symbol. These do not represent excess or deficiency but rather the energies of the year and movement. The years of Shen, Zi, and Chen begin in Yin, and those of Si, You, and Chou start in Si, whereas those of Yin, Wu, and Xu commence in Shen, and those of Hai, Mao, and Wei begin in Hai as the energies intersect.<a id="trans-405p" href="#orig-405p" class="marker">[405p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Six Phases of Qi and Their Corresponding Positions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first phase of Qi begins from the winter solstice to the spring equinox. The realm of the Wind and Wood of the Lesser Yin is in action, and the Qi is weak. Thus, it is said that after the winter solstice, the day of Jiazi is governed by the Lesser Yang. However, during this period, there are no constant standards to follow, and it is generally divided. One month into winter denotes the transition when cold meets the initial Qi. In a year, there are six cycles of Jiazi corresponding to the six types of Qi, and all follow this pattern. The first Qi is represented in the first and second months. The pulse varies in size and duration, reflecting seasonal changes and the manifestations of Wind and Wood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second phase of Qi lasts from the spring equinox to the Lesser Fullness. This is the position of the Fire of the Lesser Yin. The Yang Qi is clear, right in between the two Yangs that merge brightly, hence it is also referred to as the Yang Bright. The pulse is string-like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third phase of Qi stretches from the Lesser Fullness to the Greater Heat. This is the position of the Fire of the Lesser Yang. All things flourish as the Yang Qi is abundant, which is why it is also called the Greater Yang. The pulse is large and long.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fourth phase of Qi runs from the Greater Heat to the autumn equinox. This position pertains to the Moist Earth of the Greater Yin. While the Qi of the atmosphere remains strong, the Yin has started to manifest after summer, hence it is termed the Greater Yin. This triad of Yin and Yang along with the six phases differ from the basic Yin and Yang. The pulse is slow, large, and long; any mention of it being tight, large, and long is due to transcription errors.<a id="trans-407p" href="#orig-407p" class="marker">[407p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wet earth governs slow, large, and long; dry metal governs tight, slender, and short. With all things being moist or dry, this is clearly observable. When the damp earth is abundant, the skin pores are open and sweat flows, hence the pulse, though large and long, is weak and cannot be tight. Come autumn, as the energy declines and cold suddenly closes in, the pulse, though slight and thin, becomes tight. </p>
<p>The energy of the fifth phase arrives from the autumn equinox to the minor snow, situated in the dry metal of the yangming. The energy wanes and yin rises, thus it is also called the shaoyin governor; the pulse is tight, slender, and faint. </p>
<p>The energy of the end phase, also known as the sixth phase, spans from minor snow to major cold, located in the cold water of the taiyang. Yin reaches its peak, completely diminishing the energy that is hidden and stored, therefore it is called the jueyin governor. &quot;Jue&quot; means to end. The pulse becomes deep, short, and solid. All things are stored within, cold energy blocks flow, hindering the skin and liquid energy from dispersing, hence the pulse is deep, short, yet vigorous, solid, and as hard as stone. </p>
<p>In general, for the four seasons and six positions, if the pulse is excessively strong, the seasonal energy is surplus and causes illness; for instance, if the spring pulse is too strong, it results in wind-related illness. Conversely, if the energy is insufficient, it leads to illness; indeed, the summer pulse seen as excessive in the autumn may reflect this idea. For example, a slow pulse indicates cold, while a rapid pulse suggests heat. </p>

<p>Regarding the regulation of energy, treating diseases must clarify the six transformations for separate treatments, the five flavors corresponding to five colors, the associations with the five organs, the operation of the five elements, and the influence of the six energies.

The aforementioned positions mark the portal of heaven and earth, thus the initial three numbers illuminate the great symbols, while the six energies of beginning and end govern the heights and depths, pertaining to the shallow and deep springs.

Under the governance of Yangming over Heaven, the year is suited to be both bitter and pungent, to sweat, clear, and disperse; it should also be accompanied by salty flavors. Under the governance of Shaoyang over Heaven, the year is suited to salty flavors, as well as to being pungent and sour, to seep, drain, burst forth, and unleash. Observe the cold and warmth to adjust the qi. Under the governance of the Sun over Heaven, it is appropriate to be bitter, dry, and warm; in severe cases, to burst forth and drain. If not released, warmth will overflow, causing flesh to rot and skin to tear, with water and blood intermixing. The year of Shaoyin should be regulated with pungent flavors, moistened with salty, while also needing to break its stagnant qi, first nurturing its transformational source, thus greeting it and taking it away, the method of royal qi. Therefore, it is said: when the six qi are excessive, using heat as the governance of Heaven, the year should be softened with salty flavors and adjusted above, in severe cases to be released with bitterness, to collect below with sourness and stabilize it, and in severe cases to drain with bitterness. Under the governance of Jueyin over Heaven, far from heat, use warm to distance warmth, cold to distance cold, and cool to distance cool; food should follow this method—this is its principle.<a id="trans-411p" href="#orig-411p" class="marker">[411p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, Wang commented: In summer, if the cold is extreme, it can violate heat; if the cold is not extreme, it cannot. There are external symptoms and internal symptoms; hence the law states that one should not induce heat when the cold is not overpowering, and should not attack when heat is not overpowering. If one does not induce nor attack yet violates both cold and heat, then the internal cold and heat can invade each other, worsening the condition. Thus, what is absent generates, what is present worsens. Therefore, if one does not induce heat, heat will arrive; if one does not induce cold, cold will arrive. When cold arrives, diseases such as hardness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea will emerge. When heat arrives, there will be symptoms like body heat, nausea, chaotic diarrhea, boils, ulcers, confusion, excessive lethargy, shivering, swelling, vomiting blood, nosebleeds, headaches, and pains in the joints, along with conditions of excess blood leaking, obstructed urination, and so forth. Wang also commented: If one has eaten and yet feels not hungry, vomits foul matter, this is also a symptom of cold illness. Sudden muteness and confusion, inability to recognize others, restlessness and mania, incoherent speech and curses, fright and convulsions, these are symptoms of heat illness. Therefore, as the classics say, there should be no loss of harmony with the heavens, no opposing qi, no reliance on victory, and no reinforcement of recovery; this is called the ultimate principle.<a id="trans-412p" href="#orig-412p" class="marker">[412p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one does not understand this, internal cold and heat can invade, losing the proper balance of qi, leading to ignorance of the four seasons and five elements. This results in mutual overcoming, dispelling evil and attacking the righteous, shortening human life. The art that does not align with the classics becomes a warning against rudimentary practitioners. Therefore, the six qi oversee the nine palaces, which in turn oversee the nine sources, and the nine appropriations below. The three numbers are clear, each discerning the main from the guest, managing excess, and conquering diseases. The thickness and thinness of seasonal qi and flavors, as the classics state, have both weight and lightness, activity and stillness, and the quantity of treatment and preservation varies in depth. Thus, when the lesser yang is at the spring point, cold toxins do not arise; when the greater yang is at spring, heat toxins do not arise. Hence, its qi is concentrated, and its flavor is correct. When the lesser yin is at spring, cold toxins do not arise; when the greater yin is at spring, dry toxins do not arise. This is called the transformation of heaven and earth, thus when the qi of heaven and earth converges, the six seasons subdivide and myriad things are transformed and born. The classics convey that one should carefully observe the appropriate qi to avoid missing the opportunity for treatment. The disease mechanisms are cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; from this, all diseases arise. Therefore, by carefully examining the root of disease mechanisms, and understanding the essence of treatment, one can cure ailments. However, it is rare for one to clearly understand the appropriate conditions of the six qi and five elements, the thickness and thinness of flavors, and the use of these in relation to the body as the source of illness, while still achieving results.<a id="trans-413p" href="#orig-413p" class="marker">[413p]</a></p></div>

<p>Heaven uses qi to illuminate, and the earth uses qi to sustain. All things flourish between heaven and earth and are born through qi. When they are ill, they are all afflicted by qi. The qi of wind is gentle and opens the pores; the qi of heat is warm and promotes growth; the qi of fire is fiery and drives activities; the qi of moisture is heavy and burdensome; the qi of dryness is clear and harsh; the qi of cold is chilling and retreats to conceal. These six types of qi are the natural transformations of the seasons. </p>
<p>When they change, the wind qi can become furious and revert to cold; the heat qi can swell and revert to chill; the fire qi can whip through and revert to frost; the moisture qi can pour down like thunder and revert to fierce winds; the dry qi can scatter and revert to dampness; the cold qi can produce snow, frost, and hail, reverting to white dust. These are the variations of the six qi.</p>
<p>Thus, if it is cold for a long time, it should be treated with warmth; if it is cool for a long time, it should be treated with heat; if it is dim for a long time, it should be treated with brightness; if it is clear for a long time, it should be treated with rain. The qi of heaven and earth is stable when constant, and it becomes ill when it changes. Moreover, humans inherit the qi of heaven and earth; the five transformations invade from outside, while the seven emotions conflict within. This is why sages treasure qi as if it were a precious jewel, while the common people utilize it and harm the harmony of nature. Hence, Xuan and Qi discuss that all pains arise from qi, that all illnesses are born from qi, and so arises the concept of the nine different qi. Qi itself is one, yet it manifests as nine due to interactions. The so-called nine refers to anger, joy, sorrow, fear, cold, heat, shock, thought, and labor.<a id="trans-414p" href="#orig-414p" class="marker">[414p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: When angry, the qi reverses; when severe, it can lead to vomiting blood and diarrhea, hence the qi rises. The Grand Master Wang noted: Anger causes the yang qi to rise and the liver wood to overpower the spleen, which leads to vomiting blood and diarrhea when severe. When joyous, the qi is harmonious and the spirit is free, thus the qi becomes gentle. When sad, the heart is constricted, the lung&#39;s leaves are raised, and the upper burner becomes obstructed, causing the essence and defense to not disperse, leading to trapped warmth within, hence the qi dwindles. When frightened, the essence retreats, which leads to the closure of the upper burner; if closed, the qi reverses, and if it reverses, the lower burner becomes distended, thus the qi does not flow. It is also said: Fear harms the essence, causing it to rise and not descend, the yin qi of the lower burner also circulates and does not disperse, leading to accumulation and distension. Therefore, if the upper burner is constrained, and the qi of the lower burner reverses, the qi does not flow. The new revision states: &quot;not flowing&quot; should be read as &quot;flowing downward&quot;; cold causes the pores to close, and the qi descends, thus the qi is collected. Grand Master Wang further remarked: When the body is cool, the defense qi sinks, causing the skin&#39;s pores and places of excretion to close tightly, and the qi does not circulate, hence the defense qi contracts inward and does not disperse. When heated, the pores open, allowing the defense to flow, resulting in significant sweating, thus the qi is released. Additionally, it is said: When a person is in the yang state, they are relaxed; when in the yin state, they are despondent, hence when hot, the skin&#39;s pores open, allowing the defense to circulate significantly, leading to fluid drainage and considerable sweating. When startled, the heart has no foundation, the spirit has no resting place, and thoughts lack resolution, causing the qi to become chaotic. When exhausted, there is wheezing and sweating, and both inside and outside are overwhelmed, thus the qi is consumed. Moreover, excessive labor causes the qi to rush quickly, leading to wheezing. When the qi rushes quickly, the yang projects outward, resulting in sweating. Both internally and externally exceed the usual limits, hence the qi is depleted.<a id="trans-415p" href="#orig-415p" class="marker">[415p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When one thinks, the mind has something to hold onto, and the spirit has a place to return; if the righteous energy remains but does not act, then the energy becomes stagnant. Furthermore, when the heart is tied and does not scatter, the energy also stays. This discussion of the nine energies in the &quot;Su Wen&quot; is quite detailed, and its principles are very clear. However, it briefly addresses the diseases caused by the nine energies, only discussing vomiting blood and diarrhea, while leaving the rest unmentioned. The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; on the other hand discusses the illnesses caused by thoughts and emotions such as sadness, joy, anger, fear, and worry. It states: Those who understand how to nurture life must align with the four seasons, adapt to cold and heat, harmonize joy and anger, and ensure a peaceful living situation. They should balance yin and yang, harmonize rigidity and flexibility; by doing so, evils will not approach, leading to long life and lasting vision. Therefore, excessive anxiety and worry harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to unending desires. Sadness drains one’s life force and results in loss; joy and happiness scatter the spirit, preventing it from being contained; worries cause energy to become blocked and stagnant; intense anger confuses the spirit and prevents healing; fear causes the spirit to become scattered and unsettled.<a id="trans-416p" href="#orig-416p" class="marker">[416p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Fear and constant worry harm the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, it leads to fear and loss, causing decay in bodily flesh and hair, pallor, and death in winter. Spleen sorrow that remains unresolved harms the will; if the will is harmed, it causes disarray, leaving the limbs unable to move, leading to hair loss, pallor, and death in spring. Grief affecting the liver harms the soul; if the soul is harmed, it results in madness and forgetfulness, lacking precision and correctness, causing the body to shrink and the muscles to cramp, with hair loss, pallor, and death in autumn. Unrestrained joy of the lungs harms the ghost within; if the ghost is harmed, it leads to madness where one loses awareness of oneself, with the skin scorched, hair loss, pallor, and death in summer. Anger overwhelming the kidneys harms the will; if the will is harmed, joy is lost and past intentions are forgotten, leading to an inability to bend or stretch the back, hair loss, pallor, and death in late summer. Constant fear and not resolving it harms essence; if essence is harmed, it causes bone pain and weakness, leading to loss of vitality. Thus, the five organs are responsible for storing essence, and should not be harmed. If harmed, one loses balance, leading to a deficiency of yin; without sufficient yin, there can be no energy, and ultimately, death ensues.<a id="trans-417p" href="#orig-417p" class="marker">[417p]</a></p></div>

All these nine symptoms have treatment methods in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;, typically addressed through the principle of the Five Elements overcoming one another. For instance, anger harms the liver, which belongs to wood; when angry, qi becomes stuck in the liver, thereby allowing pathogens to affect the spleen.

Excessive metal causes the lungs to be ill as well. Fear injures the kidneys; the kidneys belong to water. When fearful, the spirit unites with the kidneys, while the heart&#39;s fire is harmed. Excessive water causes the kidneys to be ill as well. Thoughtfulness injures the spleen; the spleen belongs to earth. When overly thoughtful, the spirit unites with the spleen, while the kidneys&#39; water is harmed. Excessive earth causes the spleen to be ill as well. Cold injures the body; the body belongs to yin. When cold overcomes heat, the yang becomes ill. Excessive cold also harms yin. Heat injures the qi; qi belongs to yang. When heat overcomes cold, the yin becomes ill. Excessive heat also harms yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To amuse others with playful and teasing words; fear can be managed with sudden and frightening words related to death; anger can be treated by touching thoughts with insults and deception; thought can be managed by addressing fears with considerations of others&#39; intentions; these five methods must be deceitful and strange, without limits, in order to truly affect people’s ears and eyes, and easily manipulate their perceptions. If one lacks inner resources, they cannot employ these five methods. Heat can treat cold; external cold can be relieved with heated needles (that is, using fire) to warm and induce sweating; internal cold can be treated with warm food and balms to stabilize it. Cold can also remedy heat; external heat can be alleviated with cool environments, thin clothing, and cooling solutions to induce sweating; internal heat should be addressed with cold drinks and remedies for balance. Only rest can remedy labor; the scriptures state that labor requires warmth, meaning to conserve and nurture. </p>
<p>Today’s doctors regard warmth as a gentle remedy, but they have strayed from this principle for too long. Qi Bo stated that rest is essential; it also refers to relaxation. Only practice can remedy shock; the texts mention that shock must be calmed, referring to the ordinary. Shock occurs suddenly and unexpectedly; familiarity through repeated exposure helps one become desensitized to shock. These nine aspects are defined in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and are disregarded by mediocre practitioners. In our time, Liu Hejian addressed the five emotions, deriving insights beyond words, suggesting that these emotions originate from the heart. Thus, in observing signs of joy, anger, sadness, fear, and thought, they all fundamentally rely on a balanced heart&#39;s energy. As for labor, which results from movement and is categorized as yang, shock arises from the heart which corresponds to fire, and both are likewise dependent on the balanced heart.<a id="trans-422p" href="#orig-422p" class="marker">[422p]</a></p></div>

I also heard of Master Zhuang, who treated a patient with the utmost joy and music, but when he felt the patient&#39;s pulse, he lost his voice and pretended to leave for medicine. Days passed without him returning, and the patient, in despair, bid farewell to their family and friends, saying, &quot;I won&#39;t be here for long.&quot; Zhuang knew the patient would recover and comforted them. When questioned about this, Zhuang referred to the &quot;Plain Questions&quot; saying, &quot;Fear outweighs joy.&quot; These two men could be said to have grasped the essence of healing. However, Hua Yuan was nearly killed out of anger towards the county magistrate, while Wen Zhi was ultimately killed due to his anger toward the King of Qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Spring Equinox: The Second Vital Qi</strong></p>
<p>The second vital qi leads to diseases that frequently manifest as wind-heat and wind-warmth. The classics state: wind injures the yang, while dampness injures the yin. Therefore, symptoms such as headache and body heat arise from wind-warmth, as wind harms the defensive qi and dampness harms the spleen qi. Hence, with wind-warmth as the illness, both yin and yang are floating. There may be sweating, a heavy body, excessive sleepiness, and difficulty in breathing or speaking. For these above symptoms, it is inappropriate to induce purging. If large doses of poisonous medicinal pills, such as bitter almonds, are administered, and heat symptoms arise concurrently, the patient is likely to face death. For diseases caused by the second vital qi, one should use the Gui Zhi Ma Huang Decoction to induce sweating only.</p>
<p><strong>Grain Full: The Third Vital Qi</strong></p>
<p>The third vital qi causes diseases that commonly present as fevers, particularly in the channels of the lower limbs. The three yang—Taiyang, Yangming, and Shaoyang—and the three yin—Taiyin, Shaoyin, and Jueyin—are involved. Taiyang presents with fever and aversion to cold, headache and neck pain, and stiff lower back; Yangming shows body heat, eye discomfort, and dry nose with inability to lie down; Shaoyang reveals chest and side pain, deafness, bitter taste in the mouth, with alternating chills and fever accompanied by vomiting. These three yang conditions are associated with heat. Taiyin shows abdominal fullness, dry throat, warm hands and feet, normal bowel movements without thirst, or abdominal pain when full. Shaoyin presents with dryness of the mouth and tongue with thirst, and Jueyin manifests as abdominal distension, constricted feeling, breathlessness, heavy sensation in the chest, cold extremities, and bluish nails. For diseases caused by the third vital qi, one should apply cooling measures, warm the upper body, and nourish the lower body, but it is inappropriate to use purging with medicinal pills like bitter almonds.<a id="trans-431p" href="#orig-431p" class="marker">[431p]</a></p></div>

Subsequently, symptoms may include spleen-dampness, gastric distress, large intestinal problems, small intestinal issues, severe abdominal pain, cholera symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, dysentery with mixed red and white, inability to differentiate between food and drink, diabetes, intestinal rumbling with cutting pain, facial swelling and foot edema, jaundice, dryness of the mouth, abdominal distension, and weakness in hands and feet.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on the Fluctuation of Qi</h3>
<p>This is a discussion of the four theories regarding the mutual existence of body and function in heaven and earth, examining the divine mechanisms of diagnosing illness. Conditions such as dampness affecting the stomach, heat in the small intestine, and wind in the gallbladder all indicate deficiency due to falling below the norm. To remedy this, one should first supplement with herbs like astragalus, ginseng, licorice, angelica, bupleurum, and cisplenus, which are warm and sweet, aiding in growth during spring and summer.</p>
<p>The spleen represents earth, the heart represents fire, and the liver represents wood, all reflecting the flourishing energy of strong fire. When there is an excess, one should drain with sweet and cold herbs like licorice and gardenia to alleviate heat, which can harm the lungs and cause reverse flow in the chest. The bitter and cold herb, huangqin, helps to reduce chest heat and alleviates breathlessness. Safflower is used to break up stagnant blood, while huangqin may greatly nourish kidney water and enhance lung energy, cooling excessive heat in the blood.</p>
<p>In conditions of cold affecting the bladder and dryness affecting the large intestine, there is often a significant excess. Here, one should drain using warm and sweet herbs like astragalus to stop spontaneous sweating, making the exterior strong against cold pathogens. The warming effects of angelica can moisten dryness, while the addition of peach kernel helps to open blocked pathways and relieve constipation.</p>
<p>The essence of kidney water and the qi of lung metal both reflect deficiency. To address this, one should initially supplement using bitter and cold herbs like berberine to eliminate damp heat associated with atrophy. This can manifest in weakened knees, and helps to alleviate symptoms of yin deficiency, sweats, and sexual dysfunction while enhancing essence. Licorice, gardenia, and huangqin can support lung qi and balance downward flow of yin fire. When the lung experiences distress from upward movement of qi, consuming bitter herbs for drainage is essential.</p>
<p>This describes the common method of treatment for heat in early summer, which is not a rigid rule. A flexible approach, based on the specific nature of the illness, is what is truly necessary.<a id="trans-436p" href="#orig-436p" class="marker">[436p]</a></p></div>

The emperor asked, &quot;Why is this?&quot; Qi Bo replied, &quot;Excess leads to harm; to support is to regulate; regulating leads to transformation. The external manifestations of prosperity and decline indicate that harm leads to disorder, and transformation leads to great illness. </p>
<p>Consider how yin and yang and the five elements interact in the universe: the high are restrained, the low are elevated; the strong are bent, the weak are supported. This occurs inevitably and cannot be otherwise. If not, the high would become higher, the low lower, the strong stronger, and the weak weaker, leading to extreme chaos in governance. Can heaven and earth maintain their positions like this? Yet, whether high or low, weak or strong, this is still an inevitable occurrence. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When excessive, it harms the following, hence the control. Can one really act against this, and yet be unable to avoid it? As for the Grand Marshal and the Hejian, they have already elaborated, so I will not elaborate further here. For what has not yet been fully understood, please allow me to present it.</p>
<p>From the clearly manifest to the fifteen sentences of governance by the sovereign fire, this refers to the positions governed by the six sections. From below the mutual fire to the twelve sentences of the hidden essence of yin, this pertains to the correspondence of geography with seasonal energy. The two sentences on excessive harm and control indicate the need to restrain excess. Control leads to transformation. The four sentences regarding major transformations discuss the constants of control and the variables of lack of control.</p>
<p>&quot;Receiving&quot; is akin to &quot;following.&quot; Yet, they use the term &quot;receiving&quot; instead of &quot;following&quot; because it signifies receiving from above, hence it is called &quot;receiving.&quot; Although it is called a symbol, it contains the meaning of prevention. Excess refers to extreme overreach. Harm indicates the damage to things. Control signifies overcoming. However, what is received, if not excessive, simply follows. Thus, even though it receives without visibility, once it is excessive, it must overcome to bring balance, and in that balance, it becomes visible.<a id="trans-439p" href="#orig-439p" class="marker">[439p]</a></p></div>

It is certain there are things that cannot be definitively known. Yet, what can be certain always exists in the obscurity and haze, and cannot be deceived by anyone. Hejian states: When the rising reaches its peak, it seems to reverse into a transformation of itself. The &quot;seeming&quot; can certainly be sought through form and substance. Therefore, in the later chapters, the organ of the yin relates to the wind&#39;s emergence, ultimately leading to austerity; the organ of the lesser yin relates to the emergence of heat, ultimately leading to categories of cold. The emergence as wind or heat corresponds to the peak (or height), while the austerity and cold correspond to control. Additionally, when water manifests as hail and snow, and earth manifests as rapid winds, the manifestation of water and earth corresponds to the peak, while hail, snow, and rapid winds correspond to control. Such occurrences are the constants of creation; they cannot exist without peaks, nor can they exist without control. Although the themes of the preceding and following chapters may differ in seasonal influences and atmospheric conditions, the peak can harm the method of control, and this applies to all matters without exception. Because this applies universally, when seeking from humanity, the five viscera mutually balance each other.<a id="trans-440p" href="#orig-440p" class="marker">[440p]</a></p></div>

If one organ is imbalanced, does that mean it cannot overcome balance? Speaking of heart fire, if it is not in excess, then even if kidney water fears heart fire, it merely guards against it; but if there is excess, it will rise and overcome it. The same applies to all other organs. Regulation allows transformation; one must work to regulate so that transformation occurs. This may be a misunderstanding in transmission and writing, and those who read it may unknowingly seek understanding in vain, thus omitting these four lines entirely. Little do they know that the first two lines only speak of excess causing harm and harm leading to regulation. These four lines convey meanings beyond harm and regulation. If one were to omit them, the full intent of the text would not be understood. Regulation and transformation directly contrast with the following discussion of harm leading to disorder, and both ideas are coherent.

In this balance, all things are born, giving rise to endless transformations. The abundance of transformation is such that birth precedes transformation. Externally, the phenomena of prosperity and decline indicate that the distribution of the six energies governs these cycles of rise and fall, which are distinctly observable, hence it is referred to as external manifestation. When harm leads to chaos, and the great illnesses of creation and transformation arise, it indicates that when excess harms without any regulation, it results in the disintegration and disorder of governance. When governance disintegrates and becomes chaotic, transformations reach their extremes, leading to severe calamities; can there be any beings that are not afflicted? The concept of creation and transformation pertains to everything born and transformed, wherein extreme changes lead to severe disasters, hence it is called great illness. Above, creation relates to the principles of transformation, while below, it pertains to all things. Speaking in terms of humanity, regulation leads to creation and transformation, like the original energy circulating and nourishing the entire body, with all five organs, six intestines, limbs, bones, and nine orifices relying upon it.

All the five organs, six visceras, four limbs, hundreds of bones, and nine orifices can no longer function as they normally would.

Some regard the dual transformations as a single intent, while others use great illness as a metaphor for the essence of creation. All these notions are incorrect. Moreover, the essence of a person certainly has both exuberance and self-restraint; if it is exuberant but lacks self-control, then methods involving herbs, fluids, needles, stones, and guiding practices serve as assistance. For the energies of heaven and earth, those that are exuberant yet self-restrained return to equilibrium, while those that are exuberant without restraint—who will assist them? Nevertheless, the way of creation and transformation, when changed to the extreme, must eventually revert and restore its normal state. If scholars can comprehend the principles from those like Tai Pu and He Jian and then relate them to this discourse, it may elucidate the intricacies of the nexus of creation and transformation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Longevity and Shortness of Life Related to Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The Great Discussion of the Five Constants states: The essence of Yin supports the longevity of a person, while the essence of Yang leads to their early demise. The essence of Yin that supports refers to the energy of spring and summer, which is associated with growth. The essence of Yang that descends pertains to the energy of autumn and winter, which is related to storage.</p>
<p>In nature, when the hidden Yin of the heavens encounters spring, it stirs and rises above, and this is referred to as the energy of life. When it reaches its peak and floats, it is known as the energy of flourishing. These six energies migrate rightwards to the heavens, representing the clear Yang of the sky. Yang is associated with life and, therefore, longevity.</p>
<p>The primal Yang of heaven, when encountering autumn, retreats and descends, leading to the energy of collection and demise. When it sinks to its limits and becomes heavy, it is the energy of closure and preservation. This energy migrates leftwards into the earth, thus representing the turbid Yin of the ground. The act of release leads to death.</p>
<p>Outward roots are referred to as the establishment of energy; when energy ceases, transformation halts. Inward roots are called the workings of the spirit; when the spirit departs, the workings stop. Both do not rise but rather fall.</p>
<p>The energy of the earth corresponds to the human spleen and stomach. The spleen governs the energy of the five organs, while the kidneys govern their essence, both of which are offered upwards to the heavens. These two collectively govern the processes of creation, rising and floating, which indicates that spring brings forth life and summer nurtures growth, all stemming from the stomach.</p>
<p>Thus, when activities, rest, and nourishment are well-ordered, and when they are clear and pure, it is imperative not to harm the original energy of the stomach. If one descends to the consumption of the kidneys and liver, or enacts the commands of autumn and winter that lead to demise, they will align with the natural order of heaven.<a id="trans-445p" href="#orig-445p" class="marker">[445p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　气之来也，既以极而成灾，则气之乘也，必以复而得平。物极则反，理之自然也。大抵寒暑燥湿风火之气，木火土金水之形，亢极则所以害其物，承乘则所以制其极。然则极而成灾，复而得平，气运之妙，灼然而明矣。此亢则害承乃制之意。原夫天地阴阳之机，寒极生热。热极生寒，鬼神不测，有以斡旋宰制于其间也。故木极而似金，火极而似水，土极而似木，金极而似火，水极而似土。盖气之亢极，所以承之者，反胜于己也。夫惟承其亢而制其害者，造化之功可得而成也。今夫相火之下，水气承而火气无其变；水位之下，土气承而水气无其(栽去木改)；土位之下，木承而土顺；风位之下，金乘而风平。火热承其燥金，自然金家之疾；阴精承其君火，自然火家之侯。<a id="orig-446p" href="#trans-446p" class="marker">[446p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Gate of Qi</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Method of Danxi</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p>When excessive, it harms; when carried, it controls.</p>
<p>As Qi comes, if it reaches extremes and causes disaster, then to ride on this Qi, balance must be restored by reverting it. Things that reach their extremes must revert, for this is the nature of principles. Generally, the influences of cold, heat, dryness, humidity, wind, and fire, as well as the forms of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, all can harm their objects when they become excessive; thus, carrying and controlling them is necessary. Therefore, when extremes lead to disasters, balance can be achieved by reverting, revealing the subtlety of the movement of Qi.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of &quot;when excessive, it harms; when carried, it controls.&quot; </p>
<p>The interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, ensures that extreme cold generates heat. Extreme heat generates cold, and spirits are unpredictable, having their roles in the control and modulation in between. Thus, when wood is at its peak, it resembles metal; when fire reaches its peak, it resembles water; when earth is at its peak, it resembles wood; when metal is at its peak, it resembles fire; and when water is at its peak, it resembles earth. The excessive nature of Qi leads its carrying to triumph over itself. Only by carrying the excessive and controlling its harm can the achievements of creation be realized.</p>
<p>Now, beneath the fire of the heart, the water energy carries it but does not transform the fire energy; beneath the water level, the earth energy carries it while the water energy does not alter (the growth of wood); beneath the earth level, wood carries it and earth follows; beneath the wind level, metal carries it and calms the wind. The heat of fire carries the dry metal, naturally causing the ailments among metal families; the essence of yin carries its sovereign fire, naturally leading to an outcome among fire families.<a id="trans-446p" href="#orig-446p" class="marker">[446p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The so-called excess causing harm, and the receiving that leads to restraint, is just thus. I have examined the Great Treatise on the Six Origins, which states that when the Lesser Yang reaches, it is fire that generates, ultimately leading to moisture; this reflects the idea of water transforming to receive the fire of the opposite. When the Greater Yang reaches, it brings cold snow and hail, white dust, which signifies the earth transforming to receive cold water. Then comes the Great Yin, which manifests as thunder and sudden violent winds; the Absolute Yin brings forth life-creating winds, ultimately leading to desolation; the Bright Yang results in diffusion and warmth; the Lesser Yin gives rise to heat, balanced by cold. Is it not true that excess causes harm and that receiving leads to restraint? In the past, the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo explored the celestial records and the extremes of geography, gathering distant elements and observing their own bodies, questioning each other to compose the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; This culminated in the profound discussions of the Great Treatise, which articulates the interdependence of the six vital energies, indicating that restraint leads to transformation; externally, there is flourishing and decline, harm causes chaos, and transformation can lead to great ailments. All energies that dominate and come from below are diminished in their manifest power. Otherwise, when changes arise from water, hail and snow occur; from earth, sudden gusts arise; from wood, destruction emerges; from metal, clarity is revealed; from fire, obscurity sets in. These are all manifestations of extremity responding to the reception of excess. Alas! To understand the cosmic principles as a Confucianist includes the medical practitioners; it is not merely about treating illnesses. One must consider their ignorance of the principles of heaven and earth, which is insufficient for the language of a physician.<a id="trans-447p" href="#orig-447p" class="marker">[447p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Examine the disease mechanisms without failing to consider the appropriate energies.</p>
<p>Evil energies each have their own affiliations, which must be thoroughly examined at the outset; treatment methods each have their own principles, which must be carefully observed afterwards. The essence of treating illness lies in identifying these affiliations first; if one is unaware of where the principles lead, it is easy to make mistakes. The emergence of illness is overwhelmingly numerous, but its affiliations are confined to the five phases and six energies. If one can accurately investigate this and discern the critical points, treatment can be conducted accordingly, ensuring that each method aligns with the appropriateness of the phases and energies, avoiding any minute errors. In this way, the approach to treating illness and seeking affiliations shall be without regret. The True Essentials treatise states: “Examine the disease mechanisms, without losing sight of the appropriate energies,” encapsulating this idea. It has been said that within the practice of medicine, if one word could encompass its essence, it would be &quot;energies.&quot;<a id="trans-448p" href="#orig-448p" class="marker">[448p]</a></p></div>

However, Heaven is not purely Yang; it also contains three Yin. Likewise, Earth is not purely Yin; it also contains three Yang. Thus, above and below, Heaven and Earth each have the six elements of wind, heat, fire, moisture, dryness, and cold that circulate and move between them, along with the five movements of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water.</p>
<p>Human life is intertwined with these elements, as the organs, vital energy, and blood flow in correspondence with Heaven and Earth. This reveals the cause of many illnesses and the mechanisms involved, all of which arise from these principles. Therefore, how should a physician approach treatment? They should carefully observe this and ensure that nothing is neglected in accordance with the proper conditions before proceeding.</p>
<p>As for various illnesses: disturbances from wind dizziness are associated with the Liver Wood; all types of pain, itching, and ulcers relate to Heart Fire; swelling and fullness due to moisture pertain to Spleen Earth; emotional distress and stagnation correspond to Lung Metal; and cold that contracts and pulls relates to Kidney Water.

Therefore, one must clearly differentiate between yin and yang in cases of doubt, and distinguish between root and branch in subtle matters.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the higher aspects, one governs the disturbances of the vital energy from afar; in the middle aspects, one discerns the transformations of the seasonal movements; in the lower aspects, one examines the appropriateness of the north and south, ensuring that the small and great are balanced, and the order of events aligns properly, thereby achieving governance. Could there be any mistakes that are grossly different or chaotic? Furthermore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: to treat an illness, one must seek its root. The &quot;Materia Medica&quot; says: to heal an illness, one must first observe the mechanism of the disease. This is the essence of examining the disease mechanism. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Yuan&quot; states: do not lose the trust of Heaven, and do not go against the appropriate energies. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constants&quot; states: one must prioritize the seasonal energies and not disrupt the harmony of Heaven. All of this conveys the importance of maintaining proper energies. Thus, the texts of the &quot;Simple Questions&quot; and the &quot;Spirit Pivot&quot; consistently emphasize the discourse on the movements of energy. It has been said that one must first establish the year to clarify its energies, and it further advises that those who treat diseases must be clear about the laws of Heaven and the geography of the earth, as well as the interchange of Yin and Yang. It has been said that if one does not understand the seasonal changes of the years, the fluctuations of energies, and the origins of vacuity and solidity, one cannot be proficient in their craft. This is stated with repeated emphasis as if there is an inability to refrain from such a notion; could this be the private worries of the sages overemphasized? The essence of the medical path is entirely contingent upon this. By observing the &quot;Basic Patterns of Illness,&quot; one compares various physical forms and gains a profound understanding of the subtlety of the movements of energies and transformations, leaving no room for additions regarding the principles of disease mechanism and energy appropriateness.<a id="trans-451p" href="#orig-451p" class="marker">[451p]</a></p></div>

Yet, there are still points that need clarification, so I will briefly present them as follows. The Yellow Emperor said: “I wish to know how geography corresponds to the six seasonal phases.” Qi Bo replied: “To the right of the obvious is the position of the Fire of the Ruler. To the right of the Fire of the Ruler, one step back, is governed by the Fire of the Minister; another step back, is governed by the Earth Qi; another step back, is governed by the Metal Qi; another step back, is governed by the Water Qi; another step back, is governed by the Wood Qi; and another step back, returns to the governance of the Fire of the Ruler. Below the Fire of the Minister, the Water Qi supports it; beneath the Water position, the Earth’s Yang supports it; beneath the Earth position, the Wind Qi supports it; beneath the Wind position, the Metal Qi supports it; beneath the Metal position, the Fire Qi supports it; and beneath the Fire of the Ruler, the Yin Essence supports it. Excess causes harm; restraint pertains to governance, and governance leads to transformation.

The third Qi spans from the Si to the Wei (Goat), commencing at the Lesser Fullness and finishing at the Major Heat, controlled by the Shaoyang Minister Fire.

This cycle of transformation is boundless. If fire is not excessive, then the accompanying water simply follows. When there is excessive heat, the water rises to balance it, as it fears harming the essence of metal. This principle applies to all six energies. </p>
<p>The concept of the Five Elements’ cycles of dominance and recovery emerges organically and unexpectedly. When there is regulation, there is transformation. The principle states that when there is regulation, it is like heat being managed, leading to continuous transformation—what harm can there be? The external manifestations of prosperity and decline indicate that what is supported is weak, while what is excessive is at its peak, yet the regulation does not cease. In the heavens and earth, these are the six harms; in the human body, they manifest as six ailments. Harm arises from disorder, meaning there is transformation without regulation. What is supported becomes extremely weak and devoid of energy, thus what is excessive becomes rampant and uncontainable. In the heavens and earth, this leads to great destruction; in the human body, it results in serious illness and potentially death. </p>

Why is this? He replied: Although the terms differ, the underlying principles are the same. What is meant by yin excess leading to cold diseases is that the excessive command of the taiyang (greater yang) and cold water leads to cold diseases; yin excess leading to heat diseases refers to the excessive command of the shaoyang (lesser yang) with its fire resulting in heat diseases; wind excess leading to endpoint diseases means an excess in the jueyin (terminal yin) and windy wood results in endpoint diseases; rain excess leading to abdominal diseases is due to the excessive command of the taiyin (greater yin) and damp earth resulting in abdominal diseases; obscurity excess leading to confusion diseases comes from the excessive command of the yangming (brightness) and dry metal leading to epidemic diseases; and clarity excess leading to heart diseases is caused by the excessive command of the shaoyin (lesser yin) and ministerial fire resulting in heart diseases. Someone said: Yin and yang, wind and rain, can be equated with the ailments of cold, heat, wind, and dampness; they clearly correspond with each other.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: When gold is excessive in a year, dryness causes great upheaval; long periods of clear skies without rain result in yellow dust obscuring the heavens, and the sun and moon lose their brightness. This should be regarded as a pestilential disease, the miasma of mountains and hills. The confusion appears to indicate a pestilence, understood as a transmission error. When the fire of the sovereign is excessive, heat advances prematurely; fire symbolizes brightness, thus it is said to be &quot;lewd brightness,&quot; as stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; that when the sky is bright, the sun and moon do not shine clearly. The lesser yin sovereign fire governs, hence it is called heart disease. The spring equinox arrives and great heat occurs at the beginning of summer. Some interpret brightness as daylight and darkness as night, while confusion is seen as misleading the heart and will, which is incorrect. Daylight and darkness are merely the natural laws of heaven; how can there be lewdness in that? What is called misleading the heart and will is also not the lewdness or evil of heaven and earth. Scholars ought to reflect further on this. In ancient times, sages looked up to examine celestial phenomena and looked down to observe geographical features, correlating the ten stems to create the five movements, and associating the twelve branches to form the six qi. Heaven embodies the six directions, and the year is marked by the six qi across the five elements. By adding the six qi of heaven to the six divisions of the year&#39;s five movements, one can discern the principles of gain and loss, which are universally valid. As the tradition states, the height of heaven and the distance of the stars, if one seeks their meanings, one could thus attain understanding even after a thousand years.<a id="trans-457p" href="#orig-457p" class="marker">[457p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Exegesis on the Great Treatise of Temporal Origins and the Principle of Qi</strong></p>
<p>According to the Great Treatise on Temporal Origins, the heavens have five elements and regularities, which pertain to the beginnings of the discussion on the five movements and six qi, marking the start of the changes between abundance and deficiency. The five movements refer to the wood, fire, earth, metal, and water of the earth, governing the internal aspects of governance. The three yin and three yang refer to the wind, heat, humidity, dryness, and cold of the heavens, governing the external aspects of governance. When the Emperor asked about the interaction of the five movements in governance and how it corresponds with the external treatment of the three yin and three yang, Gui Yu responded that the governance of the five movements and the yin-yang is the way of heaven and earth, the guiding principle of all things, the parents of change, and the source of life and death, the abode of the divine. Thus, in governance, what is born is called transformation, what is extreme is called change, the unknowable nature of yin and yang is referred to as the divine, and the use of the divine without boundaries is called sage-like. Their transformations, divine and sacred, are called function; in the heavens, this corresponds to the qi of wind, heat, humidity, dryness, and cold (the three yin and three yang); on the earth, the qi of wind corresponds to wood, heat corresponds to fire, humidity corresponds to earth, dryness corresponds to metal, and cold corresponds to water, thus forming the shapes of the five movements. Therefore, the forms in heaven resonate with those on earth, allowing all things to thrive—this is the transformation of life. Yet, heaven and earth are the up and down of all things, the left and right of yin and yang, represented by the external qi of the three yin and three yang, rotating to the right to influence the earth. Water and fire signify the manifestations of yin and yang, while metal and wood represent the beginning and end of generation; this is the shape of the five movements in the earth, turning left to align with the heavens.<a id="trans-458p" href="#orig-458p" class="marker">[458p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The amount of energy in the heavens corresponds to the rise and fall of forms on the earth. Thus, the quantity of energy in the heavens interacts with the rising and falling forms on the earth, leading to the changes manifested in all things. When the energy is abundant and coincides with the flourishing forms, it brings increase, resulting in thriving changes; when the energy is scarce and coincides with the declining forms, it leads to decrease, resulting in diminished changes. </p>
<p>The transformation of living things arises from the constant energy of heaven and earth, known as &quot;normal energy&quot; in the five phases and &quot;consistent transformation&quot; in the six energies. The extreme changes of things refer to the changing energies of heaven and earth, termed &quot;excess and deficiency&quot; in the five phases and &quot;excessive dominance and reversals&quot; in the six energies. The predominance of changes is characterized by excessive conditions in the five phases and excessive dominance in the six energies, while the diminishment of changes arises from deficiencies in the five phases and reversals in the six energies. </p>
<p>All discussions about the five phases and six energies relate to their transformations of abundance and scarcity. This topic, explored thoroughly in the latter part of the classic texts, encompasses countless words aiming to thoroughly elucidate these four concepts, which scholars should study diligently. </p>
<p>The movements of the five phases each have their designated periods and are not limited to just the main seasonal times, referring to wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The governance of each phase concludes its yearly cycle and is not confined merely to the seasonal timing within a year. Previous sections discuss the five phases without addressing the six energies, focusing on the main seasonal times without considering the yearly governance. This section begins the discussion of how the five phases and six energies interact and govern together, extending beyond only the five phases; it subsequently explores how each phase governs its respective year, extending beyond just the main seasonal times.<a id="trans-459p" href="#orig-459p" class="marker">[459p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the Great Discussion of the Five Movements, the Yellow Emperor sat in the Hall of Brightness to express his desire to understand their origins. He then discussed the meanings of Yin and Yang derived from the previous text on the Five Movements and Six Qi. This discussion encompasses the symbols of the Five Heavens, wherein the constellations traversed represent the transformations of Qi, corresponding to the same categories of the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches, along with those that are linked in position, resulting in harmonious transformations.</p>
<p>The Earth governs the first (Jia) and sixth (Ji) stems and corresponds to the Ox (Chou) and Goat (Wei) branches. The Moon governs these as the energy of the dark heavens, traversing the symbol of the heart and the tail represented by Ji (the sixth stem) and the middle palace. Therefore, Jia and Chou share a position, while Ji and Wei belong to the same category, leading to the transformation of moist Earth.</p>
<p>Metal governs the second (Yi) and seventh (Geng) stems and relates to the Rabbit (Yin) and Rooster (You) branches. The Yangming governs these as the energy of the pure heavens, traversing the symbols of the stars Kang (Kang), Zhi (Zhi), Ma (Mao), and Bi (Bi).

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The unrefined earth is nestled within, with Gui water connected to Yin. The earth in the center of Chou is moist, indicating that wet earth is present, with water and fire circulating in between. In the heavens, it resides before the earth, while in the ground, it resides behind the earth, leading to a constant mixture of earth and fire. Thus, earth thrives during the hot summer. Danxi deeply understood this principle and elucidated that the combination of dampness and heat often leads to illness, with eight or nine out of ten cases involving dampness generating heat, and prolonged heat giving rise to dampness. According to the celestial patterns, the stars traversing their territories primarily belong to the positions of the five movements, not extending to the positions of the six energies. This is because the stem relates to the roots of wood, while the branches and leaves correspond to the supports; therefore, when mentioning stems, the supports are included. Thus, transformations are of the same nature as both stems and supports, signifying a blend of roots and branches. Some say in recent times that only the transformations from the five movements should be considered for the celestial patterns, neglecting the transformations of the six energies. Instead, they assert the standing transformations: earth transforms properly at Wei, counter-transforms at Chou; metal properly at You, counter at Mao; water properly at Xu, counter at Chen; wood properly at Hai, counter at Si; true fire properly at Wu, counter at Zi; and mutual fire properly at Yin, counter at Shen.<a id="trans-463p" href="#orig-463p" class="marker">[463p]</a></p></div>

How then does this differ from what was previously stated? The response is: the meaning of the scripture is as clear as the sun and stars; those who seek understanding should excavate the meanings of the authentic and opposing transformations. Upon careful examination of the texts, the Emperor clearly outlines the celestial stems of the five movements and the branches of the six energies, posing questions collectively—not solely inquiring about the five movements without regard to the six energies. The answer given by Qibo also encompasses the representations of the five celestial bodies and their bearing on celestial stars, thus addressing both the five movements and the six energies together, not just focusing on the five movements alone and excluding the six branches. Why then, is there a failure to delve into the essential meanings of the scripture, leading to an arbitrary division of the movements and energies into two separate concepts?

It is not heard that the lesser transformations of Qi in Wei, You, Hai are real; without victory or defeat, in the cycles of Chou, Wei, Mao, You, Si, and Hai, the transformations of Qi are less, yet there is victory and defeat. It has not been heard that there are great transformations of Qi during Zi, Chen, and Shen that are false, yet there is victory and defeat.</p>

The earth receives the six entries from heaven to facilitate the leftward rotation of the five elements, which give rise to people and things in the midst of heaven.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The upper and lower realms encounter each other, and cold and heat come close together; when the qi interacts harmoniously, there is balance, but when it does not, there is illness. This refers to the celestial forces circling the geographical locations, where the qi of the heavens and the qi of the earth encounter each other. When similar types of qi meet, they promote harmony; when different types meet, they lead to illness. Even when the qi is of the same type, if they meet improperly—for example, when the ministerial fire confronts the sovereign fire—there is also illness due to improper positioning. </p>
<p>The text later states that when the minister is in the position of the sovereign, it is harmony; when the sovereign is in the position of the minister, it is discord.

The Emperor states that heaven moves and can approach the earth, while the earth is still and cannot approach heaven, creating difficulties in the interplay of cold and heat. </p>
<p>Qi Bo replies that the rightward movement is the upper, while the leftward movement is the lower, indicating that heaven is always above, descending from the southeast, and circling back to approach the earth. The earth, remaining below, rises from the northeast and follows the positions of wood, earth, metal, and water in their clear logic, cycling to approach heaven while all things move downward. Thus, the left and right movements interact, each encompassing the cycle of heaven, and when patterns exceed, they reciprocally converge. </p>
<p>However, the rightward movement of heaven corresponds to the rightward movements attributed to calendars and realities, yet all function similarly to the leftward movements of the earth which rise in the east and descend in the west.

The forms and vital energies follow each other in motion, akin to the relationship between roots and branches, unified in essence and not distinct. Therefore, by merely observing the appearance of the seven celestial bodies, even from afar, their movements can be understood. </p>
<p>From the mutual interactions of above and below, this discourse pertains to the clockwise motion of heaven and the counterclockwise motion of earth. As for whether earth is below, the Emperor states that the celestial phenomena revolve while turning below the earth, and since earth occupies the upper position, the current view of &#39;below&#39; is affirmed. If the leftward motion is regarded as the downward movement of earth, can it not also be considered as below? Qibo clarifies that earth is beneath humans, situated within the vast emptiness, thus revealing the meaning of up and down. </p>
<p>In terms of their respective domains, the director of heaven, associated with the vital energy of springs, is considered above, while the five elements associated with earth are deemed below.<a id="trans-468p" href="#orig-468p" class="marker">[468p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to its position, the one who governs heaven is above, while the one at the spring is below, and the five elements of the earth are in the middle. Qi Bo speaks according to his association, hence he says that the lower one moves to the left. The emperor speaks according to the position, so it is difficult to say that the left movement of the earth is not downward. The term &quot;Feng&quot; means to attach. The earth is situated in the great void; where does it attach and not fall? It is supported by the great atmosphere. This refers to the six seasons of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, as the great atmosphere rotates externally, allowing the earth to hold and influence its dry, moist, and solid states to interpenetrate its body. Thus, as it enters, cold and wind are below, with wind in the east and cold in the north; dryness and heat are above, with dryness in the west and heat in the south; humidity is in the middle, centered. Before fire enters, it is above the humidity; after it enters, it is below the humidity, moving up and down between them. The essence of the earth as lower continues from this point, originating from the heavens. &quot;Hao&quot; refers to the examination and observation. It discusses the atmospheric energies of heaven and earth, as well as the process of victory and recovery, which coordinates six positions, making it challenging to diagnose.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wind arises in spring, heat arises in summer, humidity arises in the late summer, dryness arises in autumn, and cold arises in winter; these are the rightful expressions of seasonal energy. When the elements are in harmony, disturbances are minor; when they are not in harmony, disturbances are severe. This means that when disturbances arise that are not in accordance with the proper seasonal alignments, their negative effects are exacerbated. The primary energies also refer to the atmospheres of the five directions, each governing the affairs of the year. When the energy of the year is abundant, it overcomes that which it can control and dominates that which it cannot. For example, if the energy of wood governing the year is excessive, it will check the energy of earth, reducing humidity, while it will dominate the energy of metal, resulting in strong winds. Conversely, if the energy is insufficient, it will be dominated and overwhelmed by that which it cannot control, while lightly dominating what it can. If the wood energy is insufficient, the metal energy will take control and dominate, leading to dryness, while the earth energy remains weak and is overwhelmed, resulting in an increase in humidity. Those who are dominated are affected by disturbances; if one is subdued and subjected to disturbances, the weak will not fear. If metal subdues wood and is then overwhelmed, wood&#39;s offspring, fire, will retaliate against its oppressor, and metal will then also be overwhelmed. If metal is overwhelmed by disturbances, the insufficient wood will be weak and will not resist, while the energy will rebound. How does the energy from heaven and earth reach this point?

<p>According to the Great Treatise on the Principles of the Six Subtleties, the Way of Heaven is like welcoming floating clouds; when one gazes into the deep abyss, the abyss can still be measured, but the limits of floating clouds remain unknown. Therefore, I will speak of its responsiveness to the seasons, discussing the yin and yang of Heaven, following the regularities of the celestial way. What is called &quot;above&quot; refers to those who move to the right. The rhythms of the heavenly way are divided into six sectors, with the cycles of prosperity and decline—three yin and three yang of Heaven—as they spiral outward. Each year experiences a cycle of prosperity and decline, and after six years, the complete cycle of six sectors is attained. </p>
<p>There are positions above and below, and there are records left and right, which indicate the positions of the flourishing and declining yin and yang each year. The &quot;above and below&quot; refer to the positions of the celestial overseer in the two springs. The &quot;left and right&quot; refer to the left and right realms of the celestial overseer, as well as the left and right realms of the springs, forming the four records. In general, for the yin and yang that spiral rightward in the heavens, those who preside over the positions of the celestial overseer witness the prosperity of heavenly governance when the three energies begin to manifest. Those positioned in the springs see the prosperity of the earthly energies when the final energies begin to manifest. Thus, within the upper and lower two positions, there are two sections of the flourishing and declining yin and yang.<a id="trans-476p" href="#orig-476p" class="marker">[476p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for the pulse responding to illness, it is like a sweet melon with a bitter stem, green onion with white leaves, ginseng nourishing while reed purges, and ephedra inducing sweat while its root stops sweat—these are all differing manifestations of the essence of the Taiyang and Shaoyin. There are occurrences of arrival, occurrences that do not arrive, and occurrences that arrive excessively. This refers to the cyclical arrival of yin and yang, responding to the seasons; when the essence transforms accordingly, it is termed arrival, and such arrival is harmonious. If the essence transforms but does not arrive, it is termed arrival but not arriving, indicating that the cyclical essence is insufficient. If the season has not arrived but the essence transforms beforehand, it is termed not arrived yet arriving. Therefore, the transformation of the essence that responds to the season is regarded as harmonious, while what arrives without having reached the season is considered contrary; the contrary leads to the emergence of changes, and with changes, illness arises. Things arise in accordance with their nature, and the essence and pulse respond—this reflects the principle of being harmonious. The classic text mentions that what the Jueyin reaches gives rise to wind-like phenomena, which is the response of things to their nature. When the Jueyin arrives, its pulse is string-like, which is the response of the essence and pulse.<a id="trans-480p" href="#orig-480p" class="marker">[480p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Its meaning, akin to the views of the Yin-Yang school regarding water originating from noon and metal from the rabbit, is largely similar, as they all circulate and are inherited to form the foundation. &quot;Kang&quot; represents excess. Excess leads to harm; accepting (or bearing) leads to control, and control promotes transformation. Externally, this expresses prosperity and decline. Harm leads to chaos, and significant disorders in transformation indicate that the energy of six and five has reached extremes and will certainly cause harm. Accepting energy generates from below and controls it to prevent excess. Thus, control comes from subtle transformation, while acceptance externally presents prosperity. Extremes lead to decline from the outside. The cycle of transformation indicates that harm produces chaos and significant illness arises. Prosperity and decline, when not in their proper places, become evil; in their proper places, they become righteous. This connects back to the previous discussion that control leads to transformation, which externally reflects prosperity and decline. Control resists excess and allows transformation of prosperity. Only when the year&#39;s energy is harmonious can its transformations proceed gradually and in sequence.<a id="trans-484p" href="#orig-484p" class="marker">[484p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From the subtle to the manifest, all must align correctly within the six positions. If the seasonal energies are excessive or deficient, their transformations will be disordered, sometimes causing equality to be surmounted or the precarious to triumph. Hence, transformations might blend and yield a partial state, not by virtue of their position. Alternatively, transformations might restore supremacy leading to completeness, also not due to their position.</p>
<p>When wood influences the Rabbit, fire influences the Horse, earth corresponds to the four seasons, metal governs the West, and water influences the Rat, this is referred to as the balance of yearly seasonal energies. It indicates that in these eight years, the seasonal energies harmonize with the five movements, creating a balance where their flourish and decline follow a proper sequence aligned with the six positions. Conversely, if other years do not align with the movements, the energies will be excessive or deficient, resulting in disorder in their flourish and decline, also not by virtue of their position.</p>
<p>Some say that Wang&#39;s commentary explains that water represents the acceptance of fire below; when it is excessively hot, it overflows like water. When earth accepts water below, extreme cold makes ice solid like earth. Wind accepting earth below signifies rain driven by strong winds. Metal accepting wind below shows that the wind stirs the air, drying all things. Fire accepting metal below represents fire refining metal. Lin&#39;s rectifications further illustrate that wood can sprout and break.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The rise and fall of things follow a sequence without chaos. During prosperity, one should take the correct position in governance; during decline, one should inherit the proper position. Each should adhere to the correct principle of its own phase: warmth belongs to spring, heat to summer, coolness to autumn, and cold to winter. When the climate is balanced, it allows for growth and storage. This is the fundamental principle of the classics, discussing the cyclical nature of the four seasons and the proper alignment of transformations.</p>
<p>Wang&#39;s commentary explains the idea of inheriting the underlying principles, while Lin mentions the destruction and bending of wood, representing the violent coolness brought on by the influence of the Extreme Yin. This reflects the fluctuations of growth and decline; when out of place, it leads to disorder. The decline does not follow a sequence, resulting in the violent destruction of wood and extreme anger, which combines and acts in harmony with the destructive qualities of metal, thus disrupting the natural order of growth and decline. </p>
<p>The effects of Extreme Yin, causing violent anger and great coolness, arise from the extreme wood, which leads to chaos and violence. The metal, associated with coolness, retaliates, causing growth and decline to stray far from their rightful positions. Consequently, warmth does not represent spring, heat does not represent summer, coolness does not represent autumn, and cold does not represent winter, leading to various ailments in humans.</p>
<p>This highlights the mistakes of Wang and Lin, who misused the chaotic nature of dawn and dusk as signs of disorder instead of adhering to the proper alignment prescribed in the classics. However, the disruption of proper alignment and the resulting chaos also possess unique characteristics of excessive or insufficient states. Currently, the arguments presented by Hejian, referencing Wang and Lin, emphasize how extremes can harm the natural balance, clarifying the significance of changing energies.<a id="trans-487p" href="#orig-487p" class="marker">[487p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is referred to as soft, oblique, and restrained? Softness, according to Wang, means to shorten. When the branches of wood extend but do not reach their utmost, they are then shortened by metal, which transforms and compensates for them, achieving mastery despite being out of position. Oblique refers to the bending and twisting of the limbs. Restraint denotes the strength of tendons and vessels. Wood is bent and restrained as it is influenced by the shortening of metal. Slowness indicates the relaxation of tendons and vessels. When metal overcomes wood, earth diminishes in fear; thus, earth transforms and relaxes into its gaps, while those who are restrained restrain themselves, and those who are slow are slow themselves. Sour, bitter, white, and blue pungents are all instances of wood failing to reach its utmost; metal compensates for them despite being out of position. Fuxing, what is called the manifestation of change? Manifestation refers to the clarity and brightness of fire. Concealment refers to the hidden depths of water. Change indicates that fire does not reach water but partially manifests or conceals; change is not constant. The bitter and salty elements, as well as the original essence, are cases where fire fails to reach its utmost, with water compensating despite being out of position. The principle of dips and heights refers to the emergence and rupture of sores and swellings. Sores and swellings are caused by earth’s obstruction. Emergence and rupture pertain to the opening and splitting of wood.<a id="trans-489p" href="#orig-489p" class="marker">[489p]</a></p></div>

The &quot;clang&quot; refers to the sound of metal transforming, leading to coughing. &quot;Obstruct&quot; means to hold back breath and suppress coughs. When metal in the lungs is excessive, the desire for air expands, causing wheezing; when metal is deficient, there is a desire to retain breath and suppress it. The &quot;clang&quot; is coughing. &quot;Dizzy&quot; refers to confusion. &quot;Faint&quot; means to be opposite or in reverse. When metal transforms into clang without deficiency, fire takes over. The dizzying, faint, and reverse energy rises from the emptiness of suppression. The bitter, spicy, white, and red components indicate that metal is deficient, leading to premature demise, while fire assumes a role it shouldn&#39;t and transforms. The term &quot;dried-up flow,&quot; known as &quot;stubborn stoppage,&quot; describes rigidity and stillness. When water is scarce, it becomes firm and dry, and earth enforces this stillness. The sweet and salty elements, pale and primordial, indicate that water is insufficient, leading to premature demise, while earth takes on a role it shouldn&#39;t and transforms. All of this represents transformations resulting from depleted energy; thus, the treatment should focus on replenishing this deficiency, rather than using purging methods appropriate for abundant energy transformations.<a id="trans-490p" href="#orig-490p" class="marker">[490p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In contemporary Hejian, it is said that governing involves both treatment and transformation. However, should one not alleviate the extreme excesses of the root energy? The transformations that are included stem from a deficiency of the root energy, which can be overcome by what is received. Without intervention, the root energy will further decline, and the received energy will become overpowering. Thus, when one speaks of transformation as similar to an empty appearance, can one not say it should not be addressed? This is where Hejian misinterprets, believing that both excessive and insufficient transformations are overly excessive.</p>
<p>It is said that the Wang, Lin, and Hejian clans have lost the true intent of the classics and have already received mandates in this regard. Nevertheless, the six levels of the received energy, which maintain the proper transformation, those that indicate the changes of overcoming variation, and those that elaborate on harmony and discord, are still worthy of exploration, and can be verified through the classic principles. </p>
<p>It is said that true sincerity without end is the essence of the Dao. Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements flow through heaven and earth, with one extreme giving rise to another and endlessly supporting each other, in a cycle that is boundless; this is the essence of the Dao. Therefore, with regard to their mutual support, when spoken of in terms of Yin and Yang, during the winter solstice, the extreme of Yin leads to the emergence of Yang, and during the summer solstice, the extreme of Yang leads to the emergence of Yin. When discussed in terms of the Five Elements, the Five Elements themselves correspond to the mutual support of Yin and Yang, each having its own distinction between fullness and youth. Thus, fire is the fullness of Yang, water the fullness of Yin, wood the youth of Yang, metal the youth of Yin, and earth bears Yin while embracing Yang as the energizing force.<a id="trans-491p" href="#orig-491p" class="marker">[491p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, the blending of yin and yang, the division into the five elements, and their constant interdependence and endless cycles arise from the essence of mutual support, which is sincere and ceaseless. The sage observes the river and states, &quot;Those who flow like this do not cease day or night,&quot; which rightly refers to this essence of sincere continuity. However, when discussing mutual support as a structure, it is indeed this sincere and ceaseless nature that attaches itself without change or deviation. When speaking of its flow in application, it manifests at the extremes of balance; those who properly assume their positions correspond to the constant of right transformation and harmony, while those who do not assume their proper positions correspond to the chaotic transformations resulting from excess or deficiency. The constant is a gradual progression, reflecting the cyclical changes of the four seasons; the transformations may either unleash overwhelming might, reaching extremes in improper positions or fall short of required strength, leading to deficiencies in those positions. Thus, what is supported follows the maximum limitset below, while transgressing ranks to change its fundamental energy, causing abrupt transformations at dawn and dusk. Hence, a partial change occurs when fundamental energy is partially diminished, descending to a half-strong state and resulting in a moderate transformation relative to improper positioning. A complete change occurs when fundamental energy is entirely depleted, descending to a fully thriving state leading to an overwhelming return to improper positioning.<a id="trans-493p" href="#orig-493p" class="marker">[493p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Harmony and change signify virtue and the governance of decrees, while discord and change lead to disaster and injury. In what is known as the occurrence of phenomena, such changes that resonate, shake, and uproot, are excessive transformations. When timber cannot withstand virtue, it leads to retraction and restoration, which represents an excessive recovery. In the context of harmony, behaviors that are soft, restrained, and slow reflect inadequate transformations. Conditions of strictness, scorching heat, and boiling over represent the triumph of virtue over governance. When water yields hail and snow, and wood results in destruction and breakage, these signify disasters and injuries caused by dual transformations. The birth of the Yin results in fierce winds and great chills, while the arrival of the Shao Yin leads to severe warmth and cold; these too indicate the victory of disasters and injuries. Thus, the essence is of utmost sincerity and perpetual motion, yet the extremes and inheritances of change and discord are not consistent. As a result, the responses observed will vary, showing correct transformations, dual transformations, triumphs, and the different aspects of minor and major disasters and auspices. The Wang and Lin families fail to differentiate changes, interpreting transformation as merely altering the atmosphere; the Hejian school does not distinguish between emptiness and reality, interpreting dual transformations as mere abundance; both are errors in understanding.<a id="trans-494p" href="#orig-494p" class="marker">[494p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Emperor asked about the paths and the use of seasons. Thus, it is said that the yin and yang of heaven and earth alternate and transform, as movement and stillness invoke one another, and the upper and lower realms correspond with each other; this is the essence of the intermingling of yin and yang.  </p>
<p>The &quot;paths&quot; refer to the six steps of the earth mentioned in the previous text. Sixty degrees have odd characteristics; the six steps of the earth revolve around the heavens in a complete circle of three hundred sixty-five degrees, which is the number of days in a year. Each step is made up of sixty degrees with odd peculiarities. Thus, one day corresponds to one degree, with sixty days equating to eighty-seven and a half divisions, signifying one step. In a year, without exceeding a day, twenty-four steps accumulate, and every four years, the remaining oddities sum up to a hundred divisions, resulting in an additional day to conclude the year, termed a cycle.  </p>
<p>The six airs responding to the changes of the five elements indicate a correlation with the previous text regarding the celestial cycles and the geographical positions of the six solar terms. Therefore, the Emperor inquired further. The six airs of heaven—wind, heat, moisture, fire, dryness, and cold—correspond to the five elements of the earth, namely wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, enforcing their regulation throughout the year. How do we seek the transformation of their intermingling energies? &quot;Position,&quot; here, refers to the path or step. Each position has its beginning and end, determining the potency of the six airs of heaven in accordance with the regulatory influences of the five elements on earth—all occurring within the same step, while their timing exhibits its own commencement and conclusion.<a id="trans-495p" href="#orig-495p" class="marker">[495p]</a></p></div>

The first half of a step represents the initial Qi, associated with the rising of terrestrial Qi, while the second half represents the final Qi, which relates to the descending of celestial Qi. The Qi of heaven and earth interacts at the terminal points, and the initial and middle Qis differ; thus, the methods of seeking them are also different. The heavenly Qi starts at Jia, and the earthly Qi starts at Zi, with methods of seeking positions linked to their beginnings and endings. The Qi of heaven and earth should be sought from the start of the Jia-Zi year. By carefully observing the time of their beginnings and endings, one can anticipate the arrival of the climatic conditions. If the six Qis begin and end early or late within a year, this indicates the distinction in the beginnings and endings of the two Qis of heaven and earth, governed by step intervals. Within these intervals, there are six steps each year, and for each step, the beginning and ending of the Qi of heaven and earth each govern for sixty days and eighty-seven and a half kè.

Hence, it is called the convergence of energies. This encompasses the cyclical phenomena of heaven and earth, an unchanging essence through the ages. </p>
<p>Initially, there are thirty degrees with anomalies; the central energy aligns with established principles, seeking energy that has initial and central methods. It is stated that each cycle lasts sixty days and consists of eighty-seven and a half divisions. The first thirty days with anomalies are regarded as initial energy, belonging to the yang of the month, where all energies below the celestial pivot rise. The latter thirty days with anomalies are considered central energy, belonging to the yin, where all energies above the celestial pivot descend.</p>
<p>Regarding the initial energies of the year of Jiazi, energies below the celestial pivot pertain to the dry energy of springs, cold energy in the left channel of the springs, earthy energy within the central realm, and wood energy in the main region, all of which rise. The energies above the celestial pivot relate to the descending hot energy of heaven. </p>
<p>Rising leads to descending, and descending signifies the flow on earth; conversely, descending leads to rising where the energies soar into heaven. Therefore, the high and the low summon each other, and rising and falling follow one another. From this intricate interplay and mingling of energies, the balance and transformation arise, creating shifts and recoveries in the convergence of energies.<a id="trans-501p" href="#orig-501p" class="marker">[501p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of heaven and earth is balanced and equal; therefore, between rising and falling, each maintains its boundary and responds to the constant transformations of the seasons. When there is abundance or scarcity, those that are abundant and similar in nature prevail; when they prevail, they exceed the established order of the seasons. Conversely, those that are scarce and similar in nature are disregarded; when they are disregarded, they become part of the energies outside the established seasonal order. The energies that come and prevail continually change, thus maintaining transformations and resurgence. </p>
<p>All of this reflects the rising and falling energies of heaven and earth, which fluctuate with time. Some say: in the phases of heaven’s yin and yang across the six seasons, the two phases presided over by heaven are specifically the springs, which govern the entire year. Why is it that the other four phases flourish only in their respective steps? It is because the two phases presided over by heaven occupy the center of heaven and earth. Their rising and falling are always balanced in the central region, thus governing the entire year. The other four phases are located in the four directions, with their rising and falling not centered; they merely govern the energies of the regions they occupy. The energy corresponding to spring moves westward, summer northward, autumn eastward, and winter southward, eventually returning to the central region to flourish. Hence, these four phases each flourish independently in their seasonal governance.</p>
<p>As for transformations and changes that occur beyond the established order, even without the influence of seasonal governance, they also circulate back into the central region.<a id="trans-502p" href="#orig-502p" class="marker">[502p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that the heavenly phenomena are ordered by the sequences of warm, humid, fiery, dry, and cold, with humidity preceding fire; the earthly phenomena are ordered by the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, with earth following fire. The presence of humidity and earth is one essence, yet their positional differences exist—why is this? It is because in the heavens, it is a matter of qi, thus they are ordered by the amount of the three yin and three yang energies; on the earth, it is a matter of forms, thus they are ordered by the generative sequences of the five elements. The ordering by the amount of qi starts with the lesser and gradually increases, beginning with the first yin, which is called Jue Yin (厥阴); the next is Shao Yin (少阴), which is the second yin; the last is Tai Yin (太阴), which is the third yin. The ordering of yang begins with Shao Yang (少阳), which is the first yang; the next is Yang Ming (阳明), which is the second yang, and then Tai Yang (太阳), which is the third yang. Thus, heavenly phenomena are ordered by the amounts of yin and yang, with humidity preceding fire. The ordering of forms generating each other begins and continues endlessly, thus the qi starts with wood, the initial qi; wood generates fire, hence the fire of the lord is the second qi, and the fire of the companion is the third qi; fire generates earth, hence earth is the fourth qi; earth generates metal, hence metal is the fifth qi; metal generates water, hence water is the final qi, which then regenerates wood. Thus, earthly phenomena are ordered by the generative relationships of the five elements, with earth following fire. Wang Tai Pu ordered Shao Yang after Tai Yang, while Chen Wu Ze ordered humid earth to generate companion fire, which can be said to not delve into the essence of the classics.<a id="trans-503p" href="#orig-503p" class="marker">[503p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Emperor, following the previous discussion on the principles of the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, inquires about the interplay of cold, moisture, dryness, heat, wind, and fire, specifically whether there are gaps in their interactions of ascent and descent. Qi Bo responds, stating that qi has the ability to dominate and recover. He explains that when heaven and earth correspond, confront, or interact, the five elements experience fluctuations in abundance and scarcity. At the junction of ascent and descent, there is a constant struggle between strength and weakness, with no gaps in their interactions.<a id="trans-504p" href="#orig-504p" class="marker">[504p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the creation of its victories and reversals occurs at the intersections of ascent and descent, where there are virtues of harmony, clarity, warmth, cleanliness, and melancholy. There are transformations of life, flourishing, abundance, restraint, and tranquility. There are utilities of curvature and straightness, burning and melting, heights and depths, dispersion and nurturing. There are changes of destruction, heat, indulgence, desolation, and chilling. It is only through change that evil energy resides, leading to sickness and death in humans. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked what is meant by evil and why change is called evil. Qi Bo replied that the life of things derives from transformation, and the extremes of things come from change. The transformation of the two energies is like the oppositions of yin and yang, night and day; thus, the life of things comes from transformation while extremes derive from change. As such, transformation corresponds with the correct energy, while change is the source of evil energy, hence change is considered evil. </p>
<p>Qi has periods of circulation, and its uses vary in speed. The energies of change have cycles of return; the uses derived from these cycles also differ in pace. For instance, as the &quot;Classic&quot; states, spring has the harmonious emergence of chirping while autumn brings the refreshing governance of mist and dew, exemplifying the cyclical nature of transformative energy. Winter, with its harsh and desolate extremes, contrasts with summer&#39;s scorching heat and consuming changes, demonstrating the cyclic return of transformation. Furthermore, the reactions prompted by lesser yin leading to significant warmth or cold, and by greater yang leading to dispersive warmth, reveal instances where the cyclical uses occur with differing velocities.<a id="trans-505p" href="#orig-505p" class="marker">[505p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All changes must involve the four aspects of slow and rapid, coming and going; these are foundational. Then, regarding proper winds and aberrant winds, they initially affect the weak. Success and failure depend on the conditions that fluctuate in the middle. In winter, one suffers from cold; in spring, one is bound to be ill from warmth; in spring, one is injured by wind; in summer, one is susceptible to diarrhea. This is akin to what Zhongjing referred to as latent energy and latent cold. The emperor asked about the slow and rapid, the coming and going, the wind&#39;s origination and transformation, hence the natural occurrence of winds due to the ebb and flow of qi. People perceive these winds as determinants of success and failure; hence, they fluctuate in their conditions, but do not align with the feelings they experience in that moment. Why is this? Qibo replied that success and failure, the states of being present or absent, arise from movement. When movement does not cease, then the meaning of dependency and fluctuation starts to clarify. Danxi&#39;s view that cold injury pertains to internal harm is a notion that holds considerable truth. Those who are present or absent are all influenced by human movements. When a person moves in accordance with rhythm and self-nourishment, their qi harmonizes, and what they sense, too, harmonizes to become the vital energy nourishing their being, hence they fluctuate in the middle.<a id="trans-506p" href="#orig-506p" class="marker">[506p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person moves without regulation and is weary, their vital energy becomes disordered, and what they sense also transforms into disordered energy, settling within as the root of bodily disease, lurking within. If movement does not cease, weariness is endless, and heavy sensations disturb the energy, then what was once lurking begins to emerge and transform. &quot;Period&quot; refers to the time of transformation, indicating movement that does not act on itself. If there is no birth or transformation, and the period is one of stillness, then it is akin to death. Thus, it is said that without birth or transformation, the period is one of stillness. Therefore, for animals, when still, the breath entering and exiting through the mouth and nose is exhausted, and the spirit’s mechanisms are extinguished as a period; for plants, stillness means the rising and falling of roots and branches ceases, leading to a period of solitary danger in the vital energy. Thus, without the breath of animals, there is no growth, aging, or vitality; without the transformation of plants, there is no growth or accumulation. Therefore, rising, falling, entering, and exiting are omnipresent. Thus, the mechanisms of animals and plants are the dwellings of transformation and life. When energy disperses, entering and exiting, rising and falling, separate and give rise to transformation and breath. Hence, there is nothing that does not enter and exit, nothing that does not rise and fall. Transformation has both large and small aspects, from the slightest movements to the vastness of heaven and earth; periods have both proximity and distance, from the mayfly, born in the morning and perishing by evening, to the longevity of the tortoise and the crane, living for thousands of years. All these four aspects of size and distance are precious in maintaining constancy; deviating from this leads to disasters and abrupt ends to periods of stillness.<a id="trans-507p" href="#orig-507p" class="marker">[507p]</a></p></div>

This includes the discussion of the five movements and six qi&#39;s convergence in different conditions. The proper function of the six transformations refers to the consistent energies, while the regular patterns of the six changes refer to the variable energies. The six conditions encompass transformation, change, dominance, return, utility, and illness: the condition of transformation aligns with the proper function of the six transformations; the conditions of change, dominance, return, utility, and illness correspond to the regular patterns of the six changes. </p>
<p>The arrival of the utmost yin signifies a balanced flow, regulating the twelve solar terms and discussing the three conditions of transformation, change, and illness. There are the constancy of seasonal transformations, the constancy of administrative orders, and the general rules of operations influencing the conditions of transformation; the constancy of qi variations pertains to the conditions of change; and the constancy of illness concerns the conditions of illness. In all, these twelve variations describe one aspect of change, related to the two conditions of dominance and return. The application of the six qi relates to the seasonal aspects, corresponding to one condition of utility. The constancy of seasonal transformation relates to the regular transformation of the six departments. The constancy of similarity relates to the administration of heaven in the springs.

<p>As for the signs of recovery, when the victorious energy transforms the virtue, it rewards with virtue; when change occurs, it rewards with transformation; and when policies shift, it rewards with administration.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, geography has heights and depths, and terrain has sizes. The high places have cold air and are often clear and dry, while the low places have hot air and are often rainy and humid. Smaller differences are minor, while larger differences are significant, all mixed up in the ever-changing ways of nature. The Wang family explains the heights and depths, as well as the fore and aft in human experiences of illness, without considering the divisions of geography. This reflects Chengzi&#39;s view that the droughts and floods of the world are consistently different, which is not merely dictated by the cycles of fortune in a given year.</p>
<p>When wind is dominant, movement occurs; when heat is dominant, swelling arises; when dryness is dominant, things become parched; when cold is dominant, they become buoyant; when humidity is dominant, they become wet and leak. In severe cases, water can cause blockages leading to swelling, which varies according to where the air resides, indicating the changing conditions where illness occurs. </p>
<p>For instance, if the wind is dominant in high places, then a person will feel a heavy head and dizziness when at a height; if the wind is dominant in low places, then that person will feel tremors and movement in their legs. Similarly, if heat is dominant in high places, swelling and heat will manifest around the waist; if heat is dominant in low places, the same will happen below the waist. All of these variations in illness correspond to where the six qi (vital energies) dominate, in terms of height, depth, fore, aft, and in-and-out positions.</p>
<p>The application of the six qi returns to the principle of non-dominance, manifested as transformation, meaning they each revert to areas where they are non-dominant at monthly intervals. The monthly cycle, for example, is when the jueyin governs the celestial year; at that time, the yangming position lies on the left near the spring, in the northeast, corresponding to the initial qi; the taiyang position is on the right near the spring, in the southeast, corresponding to the second qi. The jueyin position governs above, facing directly south, corresponding to the third qi; and the shaoyin position is on the left near the heavens, in the southwest, corresponding to the fourth qi.<a id="trans-511p" href="#orig-511p" class="marker">[511p]</a></p></div>

<p>For those of great constitution, there is a gradual and constant accumulation of qi, which corresponds to illness; thus, their condition appears to wane slowly and subtly, necessitating treatment in opposition to it. For those of lesser constitution, there is a violent and sudden depletion of qi, which corresponds to illness; therefore, their condition appears suddenly and severely, and treatment should conform to this. When one observes their qi as violent and intense, and hastily employs strong remedies against it, then the heat illness remains unresolved, and the cold illness may re-emerge.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The True Principles of Treating Illnesses According to Qi</p>
<p>This text discusses the use of the five flavors and the principles of yin and yang, as well as the methods of curing diseases caused by imbalances in internal qi. It is understood that illnesses arise from the disharmony of internal qi, and thus the treatment should target the subtle energies of the affliction. If the condition is severe and treatment is applied incorrectly, it can lead to a confrontation between the rightful and the evil, making it difficult to overcome the illness, and life may be at risk. Therefore, one must be mindful to address the external symptoms of cold or heat while administering the appropriate remedy internally, allowing the rightful energies to counter the evil.</p>
<p>For instance, recommendations by Dongyuan include using ginger with a warming drink for cold symptoms, while Zhang Zhongjing proposed adding gallbladder extract to Baitong decoction to treat conditions of the lesser yin that involve cold. Similarly, Danxi advised that stir-fried mixtures in Qinhong decoction can treat women suffering from cold due to color and sight issues.</p>
<p>When the qi is balanced, treatment methods can be applied when illnesses stem from external evils, regardless of their degree of cold or heat. Whether the approach is counteractive or supportive is acceptable, and there is no need to fear confrontation between rightful and evil, as a strong rightful energy will cause the evil to recede on its own.<a id="trans-514p" href="#orig-514p" class="marker">[514p]</a></p></div>

However, the number that aligns can be obtained. The concept of Yin and Yang can be counted to ten, extrapolated to a hundred, counted to a thousand, and extended to ten thousand. The Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth are not pushed through counting but are indicated through images. The energy of the Red Sky is governed by the Cow and the Girl, corresponding to the Wu and Gui.

<p>What is meant by the separation of Wu and Ji is represented by the constellations of Kui, Bi, Jiao, and Zhi, which serve as the gateways of heaven and earth. </p>
<p>Wu and Ji are positioned among wood, fire, metal, and water; they are gateways in heaven and earth and represent the long summer in the four seasons, linked to the south with Wu and to the west with Shen. Therefore, Wu and Ji do not have fixed positions, yet they are uniquely referred to as Wu and Ji. Wu fire is linked with Shen, placing Wei earth in between; Gui fire is linked with Yin, placing Chou earth in between. This illustrates how the moist earth is central, with fire moving within it, residing in front of earth in heaven and behind earth in the ground, thus causing a constant mingling of earth and fire.</p>

<p>The arrival of the five essences each has its own five colors, traversing through the fields.

Clouds and winds are unsettled, causing vegetation to be disturbed, even leading to their shaking and falling, aligning with the Star of Venus. <strong>[Note: When Wood is abundant but Earth is congested, the transformations are not distributed among all things, hence the vitality governs on its own.

<p>In years of the Fire element (Wu), there is excessive Fire, resulting in rampant heat. The Metal element of the Lungs is afflicted, corresponding to the Star of Mercury; the gathering of Qi does not function, and the Yang vitality shines alone, with rain, frost, and cold weather, corresponding to the Star of the Dragon. <strong>[Note: Fire acts alone, with Water restraining it; the Star of the Dragon inversely dominates, resulting in cold calamities for things. Those interpreting the Star of the Dragon typically see it within thirty degrees before and after the sun, and the resulting disasters are expected to hit the southern direction.]</strong></p>
<p>In years of the Earth element (Jia), there is excessive Earth, leading to the flow of damp rain. The Water element of the Kidneys is afflicted, corresponding to the Star of the Town, producing variations in position. <strong>[Note: This refers to the time and month when the Earth is strong.]</strong><a id="trans-517p" href="#orig-517p" class="marker">[517p]</a></p></div>

Large and small represent fortune and misfortune.】 When a star is particularly disturbing, its effects are significant; when there are two signs of disturbance, the misfortune is certain. When there is only one minor disturbance, the effects lessen; when there are two minor disturbances, it refers to observing the mistakes and virtues below. Virtue brings fortune, while mistakes bring punishment, thus the signs are observed. High and distant means minor, low and near means major. Therefore, if the situation is significant, emotions are close; if minor, fortunes and misfortunes are distant. If the annual movement is excessive, the stars move northward. 【Note: &quot;Northward&quot; refers to going against the natural order.】 </p>
<p>When the movements of fortune and luck are aligned, each proceeds according to the way. 【Note: There is no suspicion of punitive actions when maintaining constancy and following the middle path.】 Thus, if the annual movement is excessive, one fears the star losing its brightness and encountering its host. 【Note: Just as when wood is excessive, the star representing earth appears red.】 If it is insufficient, its color merges with that which it cannot conquer. 【Note: For instance, if wood is insufficient, the star for wood appears white.

<p>In the East, wind arises, giving rise to wood; its virtue is nurturing, its transformation brings prosperity, its governance is expansive, its decree is of wind, its change gives rise to growth, and its disaster scatters. In the South, heat arises, giving rise to fire; its virtue is manifest, its transformation is lush, its governance is bright, its decree is of heat, its change consumes, and its disaster burns. In the Center, moisture arises, giving rise to earth; its virtue is warm and humid, its transformation is abundant, its governance is tranquil, its decree is of moisture, its change pours suddenly, and its disaster brings torrential rain. </p>
<p>In the West, dryness arises, giving rise to metal; its virtue is purity, its transformation is constricting, its governance is vigorous, its decree is of dryness, its change brings harshness, and its disaster is destruction.

<p>The energy of the Five Movements, when excessively confined, ultimately emerges; it waits for the right moment to act, with too much or too little leading to different effects. Excess leads to completion, while deficiency leads to growth. Earth consistently generates life.</p>
<p>When the energy of Earth becomes confined, the mountains and valleys tremble, thunder and atmospheric energy intersect, dust hangs dimly, transforming into white mist that swiftly rises high. It strikes rocks and flies into the sky, causing floods to emerge; rivers flow widely, fields and meadows thrive, and transformative energy is shared, creating timely rain. This marks the beginning of life and growth, as transformations begin to take shape.</p>

The wind is gentle and the atmosphere is vital; in this great coolness, everything comes alive. Grass and trees float in the haze, while dry air moves about, mist and fog arise frequently, and a sense of menace approaches. The vegetation turns green and dry, sound reverberates through the land, mountains and marshes are scorched, and the earth freezes with frost and salt. Hence, the manifestation occurs. Its essence is fivefold. At night, the white dew falls, and the voice of the forest resounds with sorrow, signaling the signs of emergence.</p>
<p>The emergence of water tranquility allows for the dispersal of yang energy, while yin energy violently surges forth. The great cold arrives, and rivers and marshes freeze solid. The cold mist crystallizes into frost and snow, leading to ominous yellow-black darkness. As the energies flow and intersect, it leads to the killing frost. Water reveals auspicious signs, yet sunlight fails to heal; it accumulates in emptiness and deep阴. White dust dims the vision, marking the emergence, its essence twofold associated with fire—before and after. The vast void is deeply fundamental; the energy is like scattered hemp, faintly visible yet hidden. Its color is slightly black with hints of yellow, signaling the signs of emergence.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The revival of the Lesser Yang sees great heat approaching, dryness and intensity arise, leading to the consumption by pests. The revival of the Yang Ming brings forth a surge of clear energy, lush trees and green branches emerge, resulting in the flourishing of caterpillars. The revival of the Greater Yang sees water solidifying into rain and ice, causing winged insects to perish.</p>
<p>The text explains: When excess occurs, harm follows; when there is acceptance, control follows, and from control comes transformation. Externally, the order of flourishing and decline reflects harm leading to chaos, and transformation leads to significant illness. This few sentences are often elaborated by earlier scholars, but few truly understand the essence of the text. </p>
<p>To delve into its meaning, it states that excess causes harm, harm leads to chaos, and transformation results in significant illness. Acceptance then brings about control, and control leads to transformation, with external flourishing and decline organized thus. Between heaven and earth, the five types of transformation interact, each overcoming and regulating the others. The terrestrial energy controls its own excess, while celestial energy regulates its own victory, which refers to the control of terrestrial energy over its excess. </p>
<p>The application of the six energies returns to what they cannot overcome to effect transformation: thus, the Greater Yin transforms through rain on the Greater Yang, the Greater Yang transforms coldness into the Lesser Yin, the Lesser Yin transforms heat into the Yang Ming, the Yang Ming transforms dryness into the Lesser Yin, and the Lesser Yin transforms wind into the Greater Yin. </p>
<p>In this realm of the four directions, divided into six phases, it corresponds with the seasonal regulations of the heavens. The energies of heaven and earth alternate in fullness and emptiness; that which cannot be overcome is harmonized, the harmonious flourish, while the discordant decline. When in their rightful places, they flourish; when not, they decline. The terrestrial energy moves inward, while celestial energy moves outward; internally and externally they influence each other, flourishing and declining in reliance, hence the external arrangement of flourishing and decline.<a id="trans-535p" href="#orig-535p" class="marker">[535p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one is overly assertive, it harms oneself; they do not receive the transformations of victory, thus when one has victory, there is also retaliation. Victory and retaliation give rise to further conflict, leading to chaos as a normal cycle. Therefore, when the upper wins, the heavenly energy descends; when the lower wins, the earthly energy ascends. In extreme cases, they may change places, and the exchange of energies results in significant transformations and illnesses. This is what is meant by harm causing defeat and chaos, resulting in significant illness from the processes of transformation. This illustrates the differences between victory and restraint, correctness and change. Hejian observes: Excessiveness harms the nurturing energy, which then leads to control. Thus, one understands that there is non-positioned victory and retaliation that are not restrained, resulting in transformations, while the external listing of flourishing and declining represents the proper transformations of the correct position. The Lou family notes: Fire in excess is harmful, while water nurtures and restrains it. Restraint leads to transformations, peaking in winter. Therefore, the heat of summer brings about the cold transformations of winter, and the cold of winter restrains the heat of summer. Excessiveness may severely disrupt harmony; thus, it is understood that there are proper transformations in the correct position, yet it is unknown that harm leads to defeat and chaos, resulting in significant illness from non-positioned victory and retaliation. How can we then regard the currently excessive discord as the balanced energy that will be controlled in the next days? Little do they realize that the meaning of &quot;excess&quot; and &quot;restraint&quot; is very clear: excess implies a lack of balance, while restraint implies a departure from excess. The flourishing and declining of transformations are the constants of the proper position; the defeat and chaos of transformation are the changes of the non-position. Why then do these two schools fail to distinguish between them?<a id="trans-536p" href="#orig-536p" class="marker">[536p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Supreme Ultimate differentiates into Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang are the principles of Heaven and Earth, the framework of all things, the parents of transformation, the origin of life and death, and the abode of the spiritual and divine.  </p>
<p>The framework refers to the principles of growth, transformation, formation, and collection. The parents refer to the formless state of all things before they take shape. The origin signifies that life and death arise from this. There has never been a thing that has form and essence yet is not governed by the Five Movements, Yin, and Yang. Therefore, the process of creation is boundless and able to be the source of all transformations—why is this so? It is because it is the abode of the spiritual and divine. The convergence and dispersion are unpredictable, and transformations are limitless; this does not imply the omnipotence of the divine is lacking. Hence, the emergence of things is called transformation, the culmination of things is called change, and the unpredictable nature of Yin and Yang is called the divine.<a id="trans-539p" href="#orig-539p" class="marker">[539p]</a></p></div>

Thus, in the &quot;River Diagram,&quot; Fire is located in the West, and Metal in the South, each revealing its potential.</p>
<p>Indeed, the five elements and six energies are ultimately one energy. Therefore, burning Wood turns into Fire; squeezing it turns into Water; striking stone creates Fire, and melting it turns into Water. Within the islets, rivers compete to flow, and in the vast sea, flames continually arise; these are the inherent aspects of nature. Moreover, why doubt the Fire within Earth, and the Metal within Fire?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the couple&#39;s union: Jia merges with Yi to transform into Earth; Yi merges with Geng to transform into Metal; Bing merges with Xin to transform into Water; Ding merges with Ren to transform into Wood; Wu merges with Gui to transform into Fire.<a id="trans-544p" href="#orig-544p" class="marker">[544p]</a></p></div>

This is the flow of fortune. </p>
<p>The poem states: &quot;In the years of Jia and Ji, Earth transforms; in the years of Yi and Geng, Metal is secured; in the years of Bing and Xin, flowing Water abounds; in the years of Ding and Ren, Wood flourishes. The years of Wu and Gui, known as the Heart, signify departure.&quot; </p>
<p>The year of Jia and Ji begins in the first month with Bing Yin, where Bing Fire generates Earth, thus it is the Earth element. The year of Yi and Geng begins in the first month with Wu Yin, where Wu Earth generates Metal, thus it is the Metal element. The year of Bing and Xin begins in the first month with Geng Yin, where Geng Metal is paired with Water, thus it is the Water element. The year of Ding and Ren begins in the first month with Ren Yin, where Ren Water generates Wood, thus it is the Wood element. The year of Wu and Gui begins in the first month with Jia Yin, where Jia Wood generates Fire, thus it is the Fire element. </p>
<p>Assuming Jia and Ji denote that the year of Jia implies the fortune of Earth, hence the initial fortune is Earth. Earth generates Metal, therefore the second fortune is Metal. Metal generates Water, thus the third fortune is Water. Water generates Wood, leading to the fourth fortune as Wood. Wood generates Fire, marking the fifth fortune as Fire. Each fortune governs for seventy-two days and five periods. This heavenly stem, being above, influences fortunes. </p>
<p>Additionally, considered by the cycle of earthly branches: Yin and Mao belong to Spring, representing Wood. </p>
<p>Yin signifies expansion. In the first month, Yang ascends and Yin descends, controlling the flying ash to signal the beginning of expansion. Mao signifies flourishing; in the second month, the Yang energy is strong and thrives. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we examine its profound significance, water originates from the One, when heaven and earth were not yet separated and all things had not yet come into being. Everything is seen first in water; thus, the seeds of plants and the embryos of creatures, although not yet formed, are all associated with water. When water gathers, it takes on forms and qualities, embodying both yin and yang, and only then do things come into existence. Therefore, those things that are small and bitter signify fire. When things are ripe, they are sweet, which is the flavor of earth. When sweetness reaches its extreme, it turns bland, returning to the original state. Humans, endowed with yin and yang, are first formed with two kidneys. Although the seeds and fruits of plants vary in size, they all contain a duality that unites, resembling the kidneys in humans. Thus, without the union of yin and yang, all things cannot transform and arise; hence, fire is mentioned second. Once yin and yang unite, there is spring birth and autumn maturity; therefore, wood is mentioned third, and metal fourth.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heavens do not have seasons by themselves; rather, the phenomena of wind, rain, frost, and dew in trees and grass follow a timetable that can be verified and measured, hence they are called seasonal markers. Referring to a seasonal marker day, it corresponds to the five phases interacting with one another, equating to five days. The text states: the period consists of three hundred and sixty ten-day cycles, with six extra days, determined by leap months to establish the four seasons within a year, which embodies this meaning.</p>
<p>Within a single cycle, the principal energy resides in its position, while the secondary energy follows below; the guest energy operates above, and cycles through.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The above concerns the influence of external factors on the primary conditions, using these past two years as examples. Discussing the primary elements: in spring, there is warmth; in summer, heat; in autumn, coolness; and in winter, coldness. Wind causes movement, fire provides warmth, heat brings humidity, moisture offers nourishment, dryness causes aridity, and coldness creates solidity—all are manifestations of the proper flow of the universe&#39;s vital forces. However, when external influences overpower the primary elements, adverse conditions arise: spring brings chilling winds, summer experiences oppressive gloom, autumn suffers from persistent rain, and winter faces unwelcome sunshine. When wind prevails, the land shakes; when fire dominates, the earth becomes solid; when heat overpowers, the ground becomes scorching; when moisture prevails, the soil turns muddy; when dryness wins, the land dries up; and when cold prevails, the earth fractures. Uneven climates lead to the emergence of diseases at certain times. In the sixth year of the cycle, when the earth’s energy is excessive, humidity increases, resulting in illnesses linked to dampness. Thus, treatment should focus on eliminating moisture to strengthen the kidneys.<a id="trans-558p" href="#orig-558p" class="marker">[558p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the years of Xin Chou and Xin Wei, the运 (Yun) of cold water affects the position of the Earth; in the years of Gui Mao and Gui You, the运 (Yun) of ruling fire affects the position of the Earth; in the years of Gui Si and Gui Hai, the运 (Yun) of mutual fire affects the position of the Earth. Among sixty years, these six years have the same significance. </p>
<p>Main Idea: In yang years, the pre-heaven transformation occurs first, resulting in a strong self that overcomes the substantial, which signifies victory over the other, thus the defeated will suffer from evils. In yin years, the post-heaven transformation occurs, leading to a weak self that experiences declining energy, leading to the other overcoming the self, thus the one that prevails over the self arrives to conquer, and after being conquered, must wait for the right time to recover. When recovering from that which has been conquered, the self cannot advance; thus, one must wait until the right time arrives, then the child will flourish, and then the child will restore the cycle. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it states that in excessively yang years, one transgresses that which cannot be defeated and takes control over that which is overcome; in insufficient yin years, the one that prevails acts recklessly and thus suffers the consequences. For example, if liver wood is excessive, it signifies strong qi at that time, which weakens lung metal while dominating spleen earth; if liver wood is insufficient, earth has nothing to fear, thus acting recklessly and dominating kidney water, illustrating the principle of generation and overcoming in the five elements. Therefore, when victory reaches, recovery occurs; after recovery, the victory happens, which leads to irregular qi that does not cease. If one recovers but does not prevail, it means the vital essence has been harmed and there is an end to it.</p>
<p>The classic states: Excess leads to harm; reception leads to control; control leads to transformation. Externally, the rise and fall is listed; harm leads to disorder, and transformation leads to major diseases. </p>
<p>Excess is to go beyond the limit and not retreat. Failing to retreat when one should, initially brings disaster to others, and ultimately brings disaster upon oneself. Reception implies following; serving below while protecting above carries the meaning of defense.<a id="trans-565p" href="#orig-565p" class="marker">[565p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Control masters victory; through control, transformation occurs. When there is governance, the six energies do not become excessive, leading to balance. In balance, all things arise and undergo endless changes. The act of being originates from non-being, while transformation arises from being but can lead to non-being. The external display of prosperity and decline is governed by the distribution of the six energies, which alternate between abundance and scarcity. If there is harm without governance, it will result in the collapse and disorder of governance, causing disaster and transformation, leading to the great calamity of all things. This great calamity refers to disasters and changes. When all things are afflicted, can heaven and earth still maintain their positions? This excessive harm stems from control, which is unavoidable and inevitable. Taking the timing of heaven into account, if spring does not yield to the winter&#39;s decree, then water becomes excessively dominant, harming the wood it supports. However, fire, being the child of wood, then utilizes earth to control water, allowing wood to receive the mandate of transformation and display its beauty and splendor outwardly.<a id="trans-566p" href="#orig-566p" class="marker">[566p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, plants and insects have their own cycles of growth and decline each year. If there is no regulation and the trees suffer harm, then winter will enter spring prematurely, causing life to wither and resulting in disasters between heaven and earth. Could this not be the utmost chaos of governance? Speaking in terms of the human body, when the heart fire is excessive, the mouth becomes dry and parched, and the body overheats. Consequently, the spleen loses nourishment, the lung suffers damage from the metal element, and from this, water rises to counter the fire of the heart. Sweating releases moisture, cooling the mouth and body, bringing balance. If the kidney water is too weak to ascend and regulate, and the heart fire is too strong to descend, then spirit departs, qi becomes solitary, and disasters ensue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said: When there is surplus, it should not be squandered; when there is deficiency, one should remain steady. Knowing when to welcome and when to follow, qi can be anticipated.</p>
<p>This expresses that when there is surplus, there will subsequently be deficiency; when there is deficiency, there will subsequently be surplus. If surplus follows surplus and scarcity follows scarcity, then the principles of heaven and earth are altered.</p>
<p>Again, it is said: When the entering and exiting are neglected, the spirit’s mechanisms are extinguished; when ascension and descent cease, the qi becomes isolated and precarious.<a id="trans-567p" href="#orig-567p" class="marker">[567p]</a></p></div>

<p>Entrance and exit are the breathing of heaven and earth. Rising and falling are the transformative energies of heaven and earth. Beasts with fur and feathers, and creatures that fly or crawl, all derive their life force from within, with the spirit acting as the master of movement and stillness—hence it is called the spirit mechanism. Gold, jade, earth, stones, plants, and trees all derive their life force from the external, depending on atmosphere to establish themselves—thus it is called the establishment of atmosphere. Those that originate within are rooted in the heavens, and all their movements are driven by the spirit energy as the master of mechanism.

Thus, their processes of growth, transformation, and storage all arise from the vital essence of nature. Therefore, what emerges from them is unknown to all beings. When the vital essence ceases, the path of creation is cut off. The nine orifices that are horizontal all possess the air of entry and exit. The vertical orifices have the air of yin and yang, rising and falling. The interactions within, along with walls, windows, and openings, all receive the incoming air that strikes us. When yang rises, the well is cold; when yin rises, the well is warm. When objects are thrown into the well and leaves fall from above, tumbling without haste, this is all due to the condensation of yin energy. </p>
<p>The hollow tube holds water completely; if earth is suspended, the water cannot flow out because there is no rising air to facilitate descent. A small-mouthed empty bottle, when poured into suddenly, does not allow liquid in, because the air cannot escape—so it cannot enter. From this, we observe that rise contains no limit to descent, and descent contains no limit to rise. Without exiting, there is no entering; without entering, there is no exiting. The birth of all things involves the cycles of rising, falling, entering, and exiting—this is the constant principle of vital energy.<a id="trans-569p" href="#orig-569p" class="marker">[569p]</a></p></div>

<p>Heaven uses six energies to influence the earth, and the earth, with its five positions, receives heaven. Yet, if the heavenly fire does not augment the lord’s fire, adding six to five results in one excess energy after five years; hence the lord’s fire is not suitable for seasonal energy but is merely a designation following heaven. Therefore, it is said that the lord&#39;s fire is based on name, while the fiery energy is based on position; this means that the fiery energy replaces the lord&#39;s fire in function, leading to its migration after five years. If the earth supports six with five, then after six years the celestial source energy is fully prepared, thus completing six cycles, repeating and renewing continuously.<a id="trans-570p" href="#orig-570p" class="marker">[570p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At five years, the energies of the five elements circulate; at six years, the positions of the six energies complete their cycle. The combination of five and six means that at thirty years, a cycle begins, resulting in sixty years. By examining the calendar days and the transformation of seasons, each year is governed by a dominant energy, referred to as the earth energy. If the heavenly officer is positioned between the springs on either side, moving and residing above the dominant energy, it is called the heavenly energy, which is secondary. The secondary energy follows the heavenly decree throughout the year, while the dominant energy merely serves the secondary energy. If the secondary energy prevails, one follows; if the dominant energy prevails, one resists. There can be a victory of one over the other, but no return.</p>
<p>When the dominant prevails, it diminishes the dominant energy and replenishes the secondary; when the secondary prevails, it diminishes the secondary and replenishes the dominant. The classics state: First, establish the year to clarify its energy. Each year, establish the movement of energies, examine their excesses and deficiencies, then use the dominant energy of the earth as the foundation, while the incoming heavenly energy serves as the marker, in pursuit of the six transformations. As the energies fluctuate, the subtle follows, and the intense is constrained.<a id="trans-571p" href="#orig-571p" class="marker">[571p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The restoration of qi involves harmonizing what is passive and grasping what is aggressive. Each follows the victorious qi to find its balance, aiming for equilibrium. Moreover, examining the teachings of the Zhu family, it is said that the Great Disturbance generates the Jiazi, and the initiated heads operate by numerical principles, marking the distance of time and seasons. Therefore, the current year is identified as the Jiazi year, the Winter Solstice is the Jiazi month, the New Moon is the Jiazi day, and midnight marks the Jiazi hour. Accumulating ten, a hundred, a thousand, and so forth, all is orderly and coherent, representing human effort. Humans are born into different qi, and their ailments are difficult to predict; I have yet to witness it as true. Alas! This is a biased viewpoint. One does not understand that the timing of heaven is not something an ordinary person can measure; the human body is endowed with tremendous transformation and life. </p>
<p>The Ming Tang poem states: &quot;Jia generates the gallbladder, Yi generates the liver, Bing generates the small intestine, Ding generates the heart, Wu generates the stomach, Ji generates the spleen, Geng belongs to the large intestine, Xin belongs to the lungs, Ren belongs to the bladder, and Gui belongs to the kidneys.&quot; The San Jiao also returns to the palace of Ren, and the channels converge in the area of Gui. [The poem indicates that humans embody the heavenly qi of Ren to give birth to the bladder at the gateway of life, embody the qi of Gui to produce the kidneys, embody the qi of Jia to produce the gallbladder, embody the qi of Yi to produce the liver, embody the qi of Bing to generate the small intestine, embody the qi of Ding to produce the heart, embody the qi of Wu to generate the stomach, embody the qi of Ji to produce the spleen, embody the qi of Geng to produce the large intestine, and embody the qi of Xin to produce the lungs. This applies to the heavenly stems as well as the earthly branches.] </p>
<p>Furthermore: &quot;Lungs correspond to Yin, Stomach to Chen, Spleen to Si, Heart to Wu, Small Intestine to Wei. Shen corresponds to the bladder, You to the kidneys, and Xun to the heart and channels of Xu, while Hai corresponds to the three Zi, Gallbladder to Chou, Liver to Tong.&quot; Observing these two poems, it becomes evident that the interaction among heaven, earth, and the human body is ceaseless.<a id="trans-572p" href="#orig-572p" class="marker">[572p]</a></p></div>

Only by seeking the method of survival in a certain year can one truly understand the essence of truth. Bian Que said: Cold ailments arise from the excess of yin energies; warm ailments result from the excess of yang fire; ailments from wind are due to excess of wood influences; damp ailments stem from excess moisture; ailments from obscurity and confusion arise from excess dryness; prolonged clear weather without rain may lead to epidemics; heart ailments are caused by an excessive initial activation of the ruling fire. The classics state: One must first consider the yearly influences; do not disturb the harmony of heaven.

<p>Someone asked: The Five Movements and Six Qis are discussed in the &quot;Neijing,&quot; but various schools gloss over them. The principles are profound and not easily comprehensible; I wish for them to be elucidated. Danxi said: When beginning to study medicine, one must first understand the variations in disease mechanisms, discuss the human body, and assess treatments. If one hastily focuses on Qi movements, they might end up like the followers of Ma Zongsu, speaking of people born in certain years, becoming ill on certain days, and treating them with specific medicines. Someone further inquired: The five organs and six viscera in humans correspond to the heavens and the earth, governing Qi and movements, reacting to the changes of the eight winds. Isn&#39;t this quite relevant? If one does not understand this, how can they practice medicine without grasping the principles of regulation? The answer is that Yang Taishou also mentioned this.<a id="trans-579p" href="#orig-579p" class="marker">[579p]</a></p></div>

<p>The classics state that where Yin is located, the pulse does not respond, and when discussing the three Yins, it does not refer solely to the Shao Yin. Wang Taifu notes that under the Tai Yin and Jue Yin, the Shao Yin is close in position, yet it neglects the fundamental Qi on either side. It does not take position into account based on personal inclinations, thus aligning with the essence. Therefore, all writings of Ma Zongsu reference this according to the position of the governing fire. This is what Danxi refers to as losing the fundamental principles. It is not followed today.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Concept of Qi and Luck</p>
<p>The discussion of the five movements and six atmospheres is not found in the classics of Confucian scholars, but is present in the medical text &quot;Suwen.&quot; &quot;Suwen&quot; is an ancient text predating the Qin dynasty; although not all its content may originate from the words of the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, during the time before the Qin, particularly in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, those such as the He and Yue people were indeed very proficient in medicine, yet their understanding of the applications of the five elements of heaven and earth was not as precise. Therefore, although these words may not fully belong to the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, their essence must have come from some teachings. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the cold, heat, damp, dryness, wind, and fire are the yin and yang of heaven, with the three yins and three yangs upheld above; while the wood, fire, earth, metal, and water are the yin and yang of the earth, with growth and transformation responding below. The five movements occur within these, representing the transformative qi of the five elements. The heavenly sequence ends with five, while the earthly ends with six, leading to seven. The earth of Wu and Ji must channel qi through the five, hence Jia and Ji transform into earth and take precedence; earth generates metal, thus Yi and Geng follow; metal generates water, hence Bing and Xin succeed; water generates wood, thus Ding and Ren follow; wood generates fire, hence Wu and Gui follow. This is the order of transformative qi. The three yins and three yangs of the earth are indeed the five elements, yet fire uniquely has two, showcasing the profound principles of the five elements. It is said that wood flourishes in the east, fire in the south, metal in the west, water in the north, and earth is prosperous in all directions.<a id="trans-581p" href="#orig-581p" class="marker">[581p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fifth branch is attached to the tenth and is in the dry element; the sixth branch is attached to the fifth and is in the southeast; the position of the sixth is opposed in the second, hence the fifth and tenth branches with the second and fourth branches are in auspicious positions. The fifth branch is in the southwest, its hexagram is Kun, and its season is late summer. Because it is located in the middle of the four seasons, &quot;The Monthly Regulations of Lü&quot; refers to it as the center. If the transformation of the great horn of Ren wood is to open and separate, and it changes to collapse and pull, the great sign of Wu fire transforms to warmth, and changes to be fiery and intense; this is how transformation becomes change. The lesser horn of Ding wood, with insufficient wood energy, leads to clarity overcoming warmth, and warmth returning; the lesser sign of Gui fire, with insufficient fire energy, leads to cold overcoming and rain returning; thus, the transformation into return occurs. When cold is severe, it becomes the flame of yang, which represents fire; when mugginess and heat are severe, it becomes starkly clear, representing metal; this is how congestion becomes stifled and unextending. When water is congested and emerges, it becomes hail; when earth is congested and emerges, it becomes a sudden shower; this is how congestion arises in fury. When the wind overcomes, it defeats the great yin; when heat overcomes, it defeats the yangming; this is how it overwhelms what it defeats. Under the influence of fire, water energy is borne; under the pressure of damp earth, wind energy carries; thus extremes give rise to reversals. If the transformation into collapse and pull does not respond, then great winds will sweep across the sky; if the transformation into fiery intensity does not respond, the thin sea will be entirely scorched; if clarity overcomes does not respond, then the universe will be unmistakably bright and clear; if rain energy returning does not respond, then all mountains and marshes will be in steam and humidity.<a id="trans-582p" href="#orig-582p" class="marker">[582p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The principles are rooted in prosperity, development, indulgence, and acceptance. All of these reflect a truth. When responding, there may not necessarily be a moment for it, leading to responses that occur unexpectedly. When the time has truly come, there can be sudden occurrences. Therefore, even at a distance of a thousand miles, there may be similar transformations; at a close distance of a hundred miles, the transformations may also differ. If one reads the signs in accordance with the time and place, it becomes possible to predict fortune and misfortune. Moreover, the &quot;Suwen,&quot; which discusses the transformation of the energies of heaven and earth, aims to observe these changes to alleviate the suffering of the people. The vastness of heaven and earth parallels the smallness of the human body, where the energies of the five elements reside. When the energies of heaven and earth remain constant, people will be at peace and free from disasters. However, when the energies of heaven and earth change and lose their constancy, ailments will arise. Therefore, when wood energy prevails, the liver experiences real illness, and the spleen suffers from deficiency. When fire energy prevails, the heart faces real illness, while the lungs deal with deficiency. This is something that doctors can discern, while scholars may not grasp the details. Furthermore, governing the heavens and earth, managing yin and yang, and aligning with the five elements ensures that winter does not bring unseasonable warmth, summer does not have lurking cold, autumn is free from bitter rain, and spring is devoid of sorrowful winds. When the harmonious energy flows between these seasons, the nation will not suffer from floods or droughts, and the people will be free from malevolent diseases; this is what scholars should observe, something doctors may not necessarily know. The &quot;Suwen&quot; also briefly touches upon this.<a id="trans-583p" href="#orig-583p" class="marker">[583p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of the Five Elements constitutes the Five Coordinates, corresponding with the cycle of fortune. There are the Year Star and the Morning Star; through these, one observes the reversals and smoothness of their paths, and divines fortune and misfortune. Yet it must be said, those with virtue will gain blessings, while those who err will incur punishment. This reflects the harmony of fortune and destiny leading to auspiciousness, summoned by the virtuous. In contrast, discord in fortune leads to afflictions, brought upon by the errant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this explanation is brief and lacks detail; the texts of our scholars provide thorough elaboration. The &quot;Hong Fan&quot; begins with the Five Elements, centers on the Supreme Ultimate, and concludes with the Five Blessings and Six Extremes. The sage establishes the Ultimate above to align with the application of the Five Elements, such that the people of the world possess the Five Blessings and lack the Six Extremes. With the Five Blessings, they can attain peace and well-being; devoid of the Six Extremes, they can evade illnesses. This principle naturally aligns with forces beyond mere fortune, which is why during the reign of Great Shun, it was observed.</p>
<p>Through the poem of Geng, yin and yang followed their paths; through the poem of Huashu, the Four Seasons maintained their harmony; through the poem of Yi, all things found their appropriateness. This establishes the Supreme Ultimate, aligns with the Five Elements, and demonstrates to the people the presence of the Five Blessings while lacking the Six Extremes. Therefore, the &quot;Su Wen&quot; is a manual of methods, while the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; is the grand doctrine of the sages in governing the world. To know the &quot;Su Wen&quot; but not the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; is to belong to the realm of prescriptions; to know the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; but not the &quot;Su Wen&quot; is not to be considered a accomplished scholar.</p>

<p><strong>On the Climate of the Four Seasons</strong></p>
<p>The six qi begin and end at different times, and the five movements exhibit variations in fullness and emptiness. By examining the fundamental principles and analyzing the numerical patterns, we find that there has been no discrepancy throughout the ages. The classics say: every five days corresponds to a候 (hou), which aligns with the five elements. Therefore, three candidates form one qi, which spans fifteen days. Three qi together create one节 (jie), referring to the significant points: the beginning of spring, the spring equinox, the beginning of summer, the summer solstice, the beginning of autumn, the autumn equinox, the beginning of winter, and the winter solstice; these are the eight节. The four directions account for the twenty-four qi, governing the four seasons, thus completing the year. </p>
<p>In the discussions of spring and autumn, the term &quot;division&quot; refers to the monthly qi: by the end of the first half of the second month, one qi transitions to another, while by the end of the first half of the eighth month, the fourth qi concludes and transitions to the fifth. When discussing the qi of the four seasons, it is the yin-yang, cold-warm qi that can be categorized at this stage. Day and night are divided into fifty segments, which also represents a division of yin and yang. Therefore, the classics state: &quot;Division leads to differing qi.&quot;<a id="trans-585p" href="#orig-585p" class="marker">[585p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In terms of the six atmospheric influences, when we speak of the arrival of winter and summer, the energy of May, under the control of Heaven, reaches its highest point; in November, the energy of the springs reaches its own place. When we reference the four seasons, the energies of yin and yang arrive at their extremes. At the summer solstice, the day does not exceed sixty double-hours, representing the peak of yang; at the winter solstice, the day does not fall below forty double-hours, representing the peak of yin, both of which indicate that the heavens have yet to change. Thus, it is said in classic texts: when the arrival occurs, the energies are the same. The heavens turn from west to east, with the sun, moon, and five planets following this celestial movement from east to west; therefore, it is stated in &quot;The White Tiger Compendium&quot;: the heavens turn left, while the sun, moon, and starry constellations move to the right. Furthermore, it is said: the sun represents yang, the moon represents yin, and their movements have divisions and principles. The sun travels one degree across the heavens, with each degree consisting of a hundred double-hours, totaling a day; the moon, however, traverses the heavens with thirteen degrees, where an odd number recurs—completing one degree while generating fractions, resulting in nineteen fractions yielding seven. [One degree consists of a hundred double-hours, yielding nineteen fractions equating to seven, with each fraction corresponding closely to five double-hours. Therefore, five times seven equals thirty-five double-hours, implying that the moon travels in the heavens thirteen degrees and an additional ten and a half double-hours].<a id="trans-586p" href="#orig-586p" class="marker">[586p]</a></p></div>

In total, it is twenty-nine days, measuring a movement of three hundred eighty-seven degrees and some extra. If we calculate the speed of the moon compared to the sun, in twenty-nine days, the sun travels twenty-nine degrees, while the moon has already completed a full orbit of three hundred sixty-five degrees, plus an additional twenty-two degrees, thus falling short by seven degrees compared to the sun. The followers of Yin and Yang say that the movements of the sun and moon are inconsistent, with the sun having variations in speed and timing, leading to differences in the sizes of the lunar months. The base of three hundred sixty-five days and a quarter corresponds to one full year, specifically twenty-five segments; thus, it may indeed be considered a year.<a id="trans-587p" href="#orig-587p" class="marker">[587p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From the remainder outside the year, there are three hundred sixty days. Subtracting six days for the short months, we have three hundred fifty-four days making one year, which totals eleven days and twenty-five periods beyond, thus establishing the intercalary month system to create twelve months. This corresponds to the energy of the solstices, which reflects the arrival of the three seasons. The half-month signifies the orientation of the Big Dipper, which aligns with the twelve earthly branches. </p>
<p>In the records of the intercalary month, there are no established energies, and the orientations correspond to other energies, dependent on the calendar to reveal the eight seasonal festivals. The remainder after this determines the intercalary month, completing the celestial calculation. Thus, the texts state: “Establishing the beginning in the beginning, representing the middle accurately, and deriving the remainder at the end, completes the celestial calculations.” This refers to celestial observations that are so obscure that they lack a measure; rather, the movement of the sun and moon each day corresponds to the twenty-eight lunar lodges as evidence, hence noted as measure.</p>
<p>Therefore, it says in the texts: “The stars are the means for regulating the movements of the sun and moon.” To regulate means to have a system. The heavens themselves do not have signs; they manifest through wind, rain, frost, dew, and vegetation, which can be verified by seasonal occurrences, indicating a sign. Referring to a single sign corresponds to the five movements interacting harmoniously, spanning five days. </p>
<p>As in an endless cycle, it is continuous and returns. The texts state: “Expect three hundred sixty weeks plus six days, using the intercalary month to establish the four seasons and complete the year; this is its meaning.” The practitioners of medicine should certainly know this. It is stated: “Not knowing the increments of the year, the rise and fall of energies, or the origins of emptiness and fullness, cannot be considered skilled work.”<a id="trans-588p" href="#orig-588p" class="marker">[588p]</a></p></div>

For instance, in the year of Shenzi, the initial Qi begins on the day of Dahan at the beginning of Yinjun, extending to the spring equinox at the middle of Zi, thus the initial Qi just completes sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks. The second Qi starts on that day at the time of Zi, at eighty-seven marks and six minutes, extending until the minor full moon at the time of Xu, marking the second Qi which also completes sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks. Subsequent Qis follow this pattern based on visual representation. The mentioned eighty-seven and a half marks derive from the total of a hundred marks within the twelve hours. In the Jiazi year, the day of Dahan at the beginning of Yinjun brings forth the initial Qi, extending until the middle of the second month at the time of Zi, just filling sixty days and eighty-seven and a half marks, precisely at the five marks of Zi. Remaining from the hundred marks after deducting eighty-seven and a half is twelve and a half marks, included in the second Qi, still amounting to seventy-five marks to total eighty-seven and a half marks.]<a id="trans-589p" href="#orig-589p" class="marker">[589p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Sixty-Day Intervals of Solar Terms</strong></p>
<p>The day consists of one day and one night, divided into twelve equal parts; hence, a bronze vessel is set up to hold water, with a drip mechanism that allows it to flow and mark the divisions, creating a hundred increments for measure. Regardless of the clarity or obscurity of day and night, it cannot escape this measurement. Thus, within a single day, there are a hundred increments to observe. </p>
<p>The six energy cycles govern an entire year, therefore, one cycle corresponds to sixty days and eighty-seven and a half increments, from which we understand that the timing of these energy exchanges varies between early and late. Hence, this chart is established for clarity. The differences in daylight between winter and summer result in continual shifts between day and night, leading to different timings for sunrise and sunset; yet, they ultimately equal a hundred increments. However, the timings for the energy exchanges cannot be altered.</p>
<p>In a year of the Jiazi cycle, the first energy phase begins at the last minute of the water-dripping method in the early hour of Yin, and concludes at eighty-seven and a half increments in the middle of the hour of Zi. The second energy phase starts again at eighty-seven increments and six minutes, concluding at seventy-five increments in the hour of Xu, four increments into that hour.<a id="trans-592p" href="#orig-592p" class="marker">[592p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of Generating Numbers</strong></p>
<p>The sage establishes laws to advance cyclically, for one cannot escape their numbers. Observing the reasons for establishing these numbers, they all emerge from nature. The first is water, the second is fire, the third is wood, the fourth is metal, and the fifth is earth: Water is in the northern position of the Rat, which is the beginning of yang birth, therefore water is called one; Fire is in the southern position of the Horse, which is the beginning of yin birth, therefore fire is called two; Wood resides in the east, which is yang, thus three is an odd number and also yang, so wood is called three; Metal resides in the west, which is yin, so four is an even number and also yin, thus metal is called four; Earth corresponds to the southwest long summer. The fifth is an odd number and also yang, hence earth is called five. From this, it is argued that numbers are paired with yin and yang. Water generates at one, in the beginning when heaven and earth were not yet separated and all things were not yet formed, water is always the first seen; if we examine it now, the seeds of plants and the embryos of animals are all in water, is it not logical to regard water as one? When the water gathers and forms its qualities, the vital energies of yin and yang are present within, and then it becomes complete. Therefore, the small things that taste bitter signal the presence of fire.<a id="trans-594p" href="#orig-594p" class="marker">[594p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When things are ripe, they are sweet; this is the flavor of the earth. When sweetness reaches its peak, it turns bland; blandness is the original flavor. However, people inherit the transformations of yin and yang from their parents, thus they have two kidneys: the left kidney belongs to water, and the right kidney belongs to fire. Fire is manifest only after water, hence fire is secondary. </p>
<p>Plants and trees, despite their varying sizes, all contain dualities within themselves, harmonizing in ways similar to the kidneys in humans, also bearing the signs of yin and yang. Therefore, if all things do not embody the union of yin and yang, they cannot undergo transformation and generation. </p>
<p>Once yin and yang are united, then spring gives rise to life and autumn brings completion. Thus, wood is ranked third and metal is ranked fourth. Water has its own domain, fire has its own reserves, wood has its own growth, and metal has its own distinctions; all these are ultimately realized through the earth. </p>
<p>Hence, the numerical generation of the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—must also include the number of the earth, which is five. Water is six, fire is seven, wood is eight, and metal is nine; the earth always maintains the generative number of five and cannot reach ten. The earth does not need to reach ten to fulfill its nature, for the numbers of generation are all based on combinations. Thus, how can all things escape their numerical destiny?</p>
<p>There are three yin and three yang; true transformations arise from the original generative numbers, while opposing transformations derive from the established numbers. </p>
<p>In the records of the five movements, those that exceed their numbers are completed, while those that fall short generate; each takes the extent of generative numbers to assess political decrees and the transformations of Qi. This clarifies the practical applications of these principles.<a id="trans-595p" href="#orig-595p" class="marker">[595p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Here is the English translation of the Classical Chinese text:</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;See the illustration.</p>
<p>The song says: &#39;One and six represent water, two and seven represent fire; three and eight have always been aided by wood. Four and nine denote the countryside of metal, while five is the realm of the impoverished, as the infinite does not lead to completion, and ten is difficult to settle. The five movements cannot be used to predict life; if one encounters excessive conditions, this will inevitably follow. The six energies produce verification and transformation; when completed, mutual transformation is beyond doubt.&#39;</p>
<p>Discussion on the intersection of the six energies and the days.</p>
<p>The classic states: &#39;On the right side of the bright sun lies the position of the wood, the position of the fire. To the right of the fire lies the position of the earth; step back one space (which equals sixty days and eighty-seven and a half divisions); the fire of mutuality regulates it; stepping back again, the earth energy regulates it; stepping back again, the metal energy regulates it; stepping back again, the water energy regulates it; and once more, the wood energy regulates it. This is the main position of the six energies. Starting from the day of great cold in the twelfth month, we meet the initial energy of wood; then, arriving at the day of the spring equinox in the second month, we meet the second energy of fire; next, at the day of minor fullness in the fourth month, we encounter the third energy of mutual fire; following this, at the day of great heat in the sixth month, we meet the fourth energy of earth; next, at the day of autumn equinox in the eighth month, we encounter the fifth energy of metal; and next, at the day of minor snow in the tenth month, we meet the sixth energy of water. Each energy governs for sixty days, with each day having eighty-seven and a half divisions, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-five divisions, completing the cycle of one year.&#39;<a id="trans-596p" href="#orig-596p" class="marker">[596p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we consider &quot;if&quot; as &quot;except,&quot; it seems to imply the following. The surplus of the year outside [the regular days]—the surplus being those days left after subtracting five days from the total of three hundred sixty-five—along with the days of the small months [which have six days each, also subtracted], does not suffice. After excluding the extra four to five days and the small month days, a total of eleven days is removed, leaving only three hundred fifty-four days, which falls short of the three hundred sixty-five. </p>
<p>However, when calculating the calendar days, according to the seasonal transitions and the changes in qi, there are usually the main vital energies of dryness, moisture, cold, heat, wind, and fire for each year, which correspond to the regular cycles of the six energies. This is referred to as the yin and yang of the earth that are stable and maintain their positions. </p>
<p>The varying responses to this include the celestial officials residing within the water springs surrounding the four directions who bring forth guest qi. These guest qi also manifest as cold, heat, dryness, moisture, wind, and fire, thus executing the heavenly mandate throughout the year, positioned above the main qi. The main qi should duly honor the mandate of the guest qi, which is always in motion. </p>
<p>In summary, the celestial officials preside over the first half of the year, while the water springs oversee the second half. When divided, each qi occupies its own peculiar six-day cycle, with each extraordinary period comprising eighty-seven and a half moments. </p>
<p>When the guest qi prevails over the main qi, it follows; when the main qi prevails over the guest qi, it resists. There is victory for one but not for both. Each year has the celestial official positioned in the third place as the water spring, and the fourth position as the initial qi. For instance, if Zi corresponds to the Lesser Yin of Fire as the celestial official, then the third place in front of Zi, which is Mao, represents the Yangming Qi of Dry Metal, while the fourth place in the water spring is Chen, representing the initial qi. Chen and Xu are opposites, both belonging to the solar cold waters, marking the period from Great Cold to the Spring Equinox, lasting a peculiar sixty days. Chen is situated to the left of Mao.<a id="trans-597p" href="#orig-597p" class="marker">[597p]</a></p></div>

<p>Note that the six energies preside over the heavenly year and are positioned to the south, thus addressing left and right while facing north; the spring energy is located to the north, thus addressing left and right while facing south. For instance, in the year of Chou and Wei, Earth presides over the heavens, facing north. In this case, the left interval of Chou corresponds to the Shao Fire of Yin, while the right interval corresponds to the Jun Fire of Zi; in the year of Chen and Xu, Water is in the springs, facing south; thus the left interval of Chen corresponds to the Jue Yin Wood of Si, and the right interval corresponds to the Yang Ming Metal of Mao.

There are five days of sixty each, and after the Minor Snow, its days return to thirty, ending once more with the dry Metal. For the years of Chou and Wei (未), it starts with thirty days of cold Water after the winter solstice, transitioning into Wood and Wind until reaching dry Metal, with five days of sixty each. Similarly, for days after the Minor Snow, its days return to thirty, once again ending with the cold Water. </p>
<p>This follows for Yin and Shen (申) and beyond. Thus, throughout sixty years to thousands of years, the order of qi generates without interruption. There are no teachings at the end of Minor Cold, nor acceptance at the beginning of Major Cold; if a qi is isolated, it does not continue intermixed. The cutoff from Major Cold marks the beginning of the next year’s initial qi. This is the marvel of creation, secretly recorded in the “Inner Canon,” yet not yet revealed— the original source is obscured in its discussion. In modern times, Yang Zijiang has explored and derived it, presenting interpretations that may not align perfectly with the texts but are deeply logical. I submit this here to enlighten scholars. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Seeing the Diagram</strong><br><strong>[The Song says: Water is cold, wood transforms into wind. They counter the heat of summer together, while damp earth shares the work with rain.]</strong><br><strong>On the Six Transformations</strong></p>
<p>The five elements take shape on earth—<strong>metal, wood, water, fire, and earth</strong>—and become the energies in the heavens, known as the six energies, which are the primordial energies of heaven, then three yin and three yang serve them. <strong>[Lesser yin governs fire, greater yin governs damp earth, jueyin governs wind and wood, lesser yang governs fire, greater yang governs cold water, and yangming governs dry metal.]</strong> These are called the six energies, each responsible for a transformation. The transformation of wood into wind governs spring. The transformation of lord fire into heat governs the end of spring and the beginning of summer, serving the warm and gentle mandate in accordance with the virtue of the lord. The transformation of fire into heat governs summer, where the heat prevails. The transformation of metal into clarity and dryness governs autumn, where coolness prevails. <strong>[The white dew represents clear energy. Metal represents the elements gēng and xīn; xīn is linked to fire, hence it is dry. After a long rain, when the western wind blows and becomes clear, it is a sign of dryness. When the western wind brings rain, dryness and dampness contend, yet it eventually clears.]</strong> The transformation of water into cold governs winter, where stern cold prevails. The transformation of earth into dampness and rain governs the long summer <strong>[June]</strong>, as earth is nourished by fire and grows during summer; once it has matured and rules, it moistens and transforms in the heat of the summer season.<a id="trans-600p" href="#orig-600p" class="marker">[600p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: &quot;The classics say: The earth&#39;s energy rises as clouds, while the sky&#39;s energy falls as rain. Rain emerges from the earth&#39;s energy, and clouds arise from the sky&#39;s energy, thus the transformation of earth and rain is revealed.&quot; </p>
<p>In spring, there is warmth; in summer, heat; in autumn, coolness; and in winter, coldness—all are the genuine energies of heaven and earth. The six energies govern transformations; when the guest follows the host&#39;s movement, there will inevitably be differences in reversal, harmony, triumph, and defeat, resulting in varied climates. How can one make definitive statements about them? </p>
<p>The interplay of yin and yang across the four seasons begins in the middle of each month and peaks in the final month, which is why the classics say: &quot;A difference of thirty degrees leads to the strange.&quot; It further discusses the influence of these energies during their rise and decline across the four dimensions, which are the four seasonal months: the second month for spring, the fifth month for summer, the eighth month for autumn, and the eleventh month for winter. Spring commences in the second month, peaks in warmth in the third; summer starts in the fifth, peaks in heat in the sixth; autumn begins in the eighth, peaks in coolness in the ninth; and winter starts in the eleventh, peaking in coldness in the twelfth, thus the differences in energy are evident.</p>
<p>However, in the month of the summer solstice in May, when the yin energy begins to rise, extreme heat occurs; in November, at the winter solstice, when the yang energy starts to emerge, extreme cold follows. This is due to the energy&#39;s origin from below, pushing upwards. Therefore, when yin arises, yang increases and it gets hotter; when yang arises, yin increases and it gets colder. The coolness of summer wells and the warmth of winter wells can serve as evidence of this.<a id="trans-601p" href="#orig-601p" class="marker">[601p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Principal Qi</strong></p>
<p>The qi of the earth is calm and maintains its position; thus, spring is warm, summer is hot, autumn is cool, and winter is cold, which are the regular orders of the years. The four seasons are born from the six qis. The wood of the Jueyin represents the initial qi, corresponding to the beginning of spring. Wood generates fire; therefore, the Shaoyin represents the lord fire, and the Shaoyang corresponds to the fire following it. Fire generates earth, thus the Taiyin represents the earth that follows; earth generates metal, making the Yangming correspond to the metal that follows; metal generates water, hence the Taiyang corresponds to the water that follows. All of these are mutually generated and spread their orders, each having its connections.</p>
<p>Wood, as the initial qi, governs the sixty days before the spring equinox, spanning from the start of the Doushu to the midpoint of the Yin zodiac, during which the wind qi begins to circulate. The lord fire represents the second qi, governing the sixty days after the spring equinox, from the start of Doushu to the midpoint of the Si zodiac, during which the warm and mild qi circulates. The xiang fire represents the third qi, governing thirty days before and after the summer solstice, from the start of Doushu to the midpoint of the Wei zodiac, during which the heat circulates.<a id="trans-602p" href="#orig-602p" class="marker">[602p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The earth is associated with the Four Energies, governing the sixty days before the autumn equinox, where unusual phenomena occur. From the beginning of the Dipper, as it moves from Weizheng to the middle of You, when heaven reaches this point, clouds and rain will be present, and moist vapor will emerge. Metal corresponds to the Five Energies, governing the sixty days after the autumn equinox, where unusual phenomena also arise. From the beginning of the Dipper, as it moves from Youzheng to the middle of Hai, when heaven reaches this point, the clear energies will circulate, and all things will be dry. Water represents the Six Energies, governing the thirty days before and after the winter solstice, where unusual phenomena manifest. From the beginning of the Dipper, as it moves from Haizheng to the middle of Chou, when heaven reaches this point, the cold energy will circulate. The Six Energies rotate in a cycle to form the governing energy of the year. The six energies from heaven interact with this, transferring each year as they enact the celestial commands. Thus, acting at the right time leads to change that is constant; acting inappropriately brings disaster. For instance, if spring acts in the commands of summer, autumn, and winter, or winter acts in the commands of spring, summer, and autumn, this represents the distortion due to the interactions of the guest and the main energies. Therefore, there are regularities in effective governance and laws, as well as variations in violent winds, sudden rain, and lightning. In winter, there is heat like that of scorched stones, and in summer, a chilling wind. This is simply due to the energies of heaven and earth, thriving and flourishing together. This illustrates the five energies, reflecting the extremes of excess and deficiency.<a id="trans-603p" href="#orig-603p" class="marker">[603p]</a></p></div>

<p>The six energies divide into upper, lower, left, and right, overseeing the heavenly commands; the twelve branches divide into seasonal periods, governing the transformation of the earth&#39;s forces. The interactions between upper and lower phenomena, along with the changes of cold, heat, dryness, wind, and fire, differ from those of the four seasons due to their simultaneous presence and lack of unity. The six energies correspond with the twelve branches, finding their appropriate transformations. The Jue Yin corresponds to the Si and Hai branches, relating to Jue Yin wood, as wood originates in Hai, thereby its proper transformation occurs in Hai and corresponds to Si. Although Yin (Yin) represents the primary wood division, it also correlates with the Yang Ming metal transformation. The term &quot;sheng&quot; refers to drawing from and adhering to Si. The Shao Yin corresponds to Zi and Wu, where Shao Yin is considered the noble fire, aligning with the southern Li position, thus its proper transformation occurs in Wu, corresponding to Zi. The Tai Yin governs the Chou and Wei branches, with Tai Yin representing earth, associated with the center palace, residing in the Kun position to the southwest, thus its proper transformation occurs in Wei, corresponding to Chou. The Shao Yang is associated with the Yin and Shen branches, regarded as the lesser Yang fire, lower in rank than the noble fire; although it has the Wu position of noble fire, fire originates in Yin, hence its proper transformation occurs in Yin, corresponding to Shen. The Yang Ming corresponds with the Mao and You branches, where Yang Ming represents metal, and You refers to the West, thus its proper transformation occurs in You, corresponding to Mao. The Tai Yang corresponds with the Chen and Xu branches, with Tai Yang symbolizing water; despite its alignment with the Zi position as the noble fire&#39;s counterpart, it resides in the depths of the earth, specifically the six Wu at the heavenly gate Xu and the six Ji at the earthly door Chen.<a id="trans-604p" href="#orig-604p" class="marker">[604p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, although water is used for the earth, its true transformation occurs in the Dog (戌), and its counter-transformation in the Dragon (辰). This is the interaction of heaven&#39;s yin and yang with the twelve earthly branches, which move without ceasing. When the annual cycle begins, it is ordained by heaven; the corresponding qi is present in the springs, while the residual qi operates left and right. The qi succeeding the springs is the initial qi, governing the sixty days with anomalies, leading to the qi of the third for the heavenly overseer, which governs the first half of the year [starting after the winter solstice, extending to the first half of the year]. By the time it reaches the springs, it embodies the six qi, governing the second half of the year [starting after the summer solstice, extending to the second half of the year]. The classics state: Before mid-year, the heavenly qi governs; after mid-year, the earthly qi governs. The six qi of heaven are considered guest qi. When this guest qi is distributed over the six qi of the earth, there are distinctive transformations. The classics state: There are positions above and below, and rules left and right; the master of heaven is referred to as the upper position, facing north when standing in the south, with left being west and right being east. The springs are designated as the lower position, facing south when standing in the north, with left being east and right being west. Thus, above and below differ, as do left and right. The classics state: To the right of Shaoyang, Yangming governs, thus standing facing south to observe. This does not merely pertain to the positions above, below, left, and right; it aligns with the clear right, indicating the position governed by fire when facing south.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Standard and Origin</strong></p>
<p>Three Yin and Three Yang represent the Six Qi of Heaven, which serves as the standard. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are the Five Elements of Earth, which represent the origin. The Greater Yin’s damp Earth and the Lesser Yang’s fire are the same in standard and origin. However, the Lesser Yin’s True Fire and the Greater Yang’s Cold Water are mutually distinct in Yin and Yang, cold and hot. Why is this? It is because True Fire governs the hours of the Rat and Horse; the Horse is the position where the first Yin begins to emerge. Fire is originally hot, but its energy coincides with the beginning of Yin&#39;s birth, thus True Fire belongs to Lesser Yin. Water resides in the North, the position of the Rat; the Rat is where the first Yang begins to emerge. Water is inherently cold, and its energy aligns with the beginning of Yang&#39;s birth, therefore Cold Water belongs to Greater Yang. This distinction between the standard and origin of Water and Fire is as such. Earth occupies the position of the Southwestern Wei, corresponding to the month of Long Summer. Wei follows the Horse, making it Yin; hence Earth is called Greater Yin. The Fire of Harmony governs the Tiger, which follows the Ox, making it Yang, hence Harmony Fire is called Lesser Yang. Wood is positioned in the Eastern Zhen, associated with the Liver in humans. Although Yang is situated below the diaphragm, it occupies a Yin position, thus it belongs to Jue Yin. Metal, located in the Western Dui, is associated with the Lungs in humans. Even though the Yin organ resides above the diaphragm, it occupies a Yang position, thus it belongs to Yang Ming. The classic states: Lesser Yang and Greater Yin are treated according to origin, while Lesser Yin and Greater Yang are treated according to standard. Yang Ming and Jue Yin do not derive from standard and origin, but are governed from the center. In the center of Yang Ming, there is Greater Yin [Greater Yin and Yang Ming are complementary and unite]. In the center of Jue Yin, there is Lesser Yang [Jue Yin and Lesser Yang are complementary and unite].<a id="trans-607p" href="#orig-607p" class="marker">[607p]</a></p></div>

<p>The heavens are divided into five energies, and the earth is categorized into five elements. The five energies flow and disperse above. They align with the constellations and correspond to the cardinal directions, thus being named the five movements. </p>
<p>The red heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Ox, Girl, and the Four Walls, descending to the positions of Wu and Gui, establishing the fire movement. </p>
<p>The black heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Heart, Tail, Corner, and Chariot, descending to the positions of Jia and Ji, establishing the earth movement. </p>
<p>The white heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Kang, Di, and the Four Stars, descending to the positions of Yi and Geng, establishing the metal movement. </p>
<p>The original heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Zhang, Wing, Lou, and Stomach, descending to the positions of Bing and Xin, establishing the water movement. </p>
<p>The green heavenly energy aligns with the constellations of the Danger, Chamber, Willow, and Ghost, descending to the positions of Ding and Ren, establishing the wood movement. </p>
<p>The five energies traverse the twenty-eight constellations, which correspond with the twelve divisions of the fields, clearly observable. Xu corresponds to the heavenly gate and is aligned with the position of Gan; Si corresponds to the earthly door and is aligned with the position of Xun. </p>
<p>From the Room to the Four Stars encompasses fourteen constellations of the Yang, representing the day; from the Four Stars to the Heart encompasses fourteen constellations of the Yin, representing the night, completing one day. </p>
<p>If one were to analyze this based on the lunar calendar, the reasons for establishing the movements become apparent. The character Bing represents the Yang of fire and is established at the beginning of the Jia and Ji year, with the first month marking Bing Yin. Bing fire generates earth, hence Jia and Ji represent the earth movement. The character Wu represents the Yang of earth and is established at the beginning of the Yi and Geng year, with the first month marking Wu Yin.

<p>The transformations of the ten stems and the five elements occur as each of the five energies takes its respective position and generates transformation.

<p>For example, when Jia Yin transforms into Bing Chen, it becomes fire; when Bing Yin transforms into Wu Chen, it becomes earth. </p>
<p>Moreover, some say that Jia, representing rigid wood, overcomes soft earth to create a couple, resulting in earth; while Yi, representing soft wood, marries Geng, which embodies rigid metal, resulting in metal. Ding, representing yin fire, pairs with Ren, representing yang water, leading to wood; and Bing, representing yang fire, marries Xin, representing soft metal, resulting in water.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Establishment of the Lunar Months</strong></p>
<p>The twelve branches correspond to the twelve months: thus, the first month is Yin and the second is Chen. In the years of Jia and Ji, the first month is established in Bing Yin; in the years of Yi and Geng, it is established in Wu Yin; in the years of Bing and Xin, it is established in Geng Yin; in the years of Ding and Ren, it is established in Ren Yin; and in the years of Wu and Gui, it is established in Jia Yin. The ten stems are thus established upon Yin. Observing this method, the year of Jia Zi becomes the first, as it is the first in the sixty Jia Zi cycle. Consequently, the initial establishment corresponds to Bing Yin, and the subsequent one corresponds to Wu Yin—this order reveals a clear sequence that can be followed in rotation. In the previous sixty Jia Zi classification of sounds, once the positioning is completed, it again rotates to finalize the record. This is evident. </p>
<p>When establishing the time, the same principle applies to the day stem. If the five periods of Yin years do not reach that year, when the Day of Major Cold intersects with the Initial Qi, the day and time stems that correspond with the year stem are called De Fu, which indicates the balance of Qi, neither excessive nor deficient. This is briefly presented to clarify its application. The diagram is provided later.</p>

<p>The five tones are the sounds of the five elements. The Earth is called &quot;Gong,&quot; which corresponds to the years of Jia and Ji. &quot;Gong&quot; represents the Earth. The way of balance and harmony permeates all aspects and is collectively referred to as &quot;Gong,&quot; encompassing various formations. It is understood that the Earth connects with Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, governing the four seasons and nourishing the five organs, all embodying a unified concept. Thus, the five operations begin from the ten Heavenly Stems, with Jia representing the Earth. The Earth generates Metal, hence Yi follows; Metal generates Water, thus Bing follows. In this way, the five elements generate and transform each other, with Jia as Yang and Yi as Yin, alternating in sequence like an endless loop. In Yang years, it is called &quot;Tai,&quot; and in Yin years, it is called &quot;Shao.&quot; An excessive Yang year is restrained by the Celestial Authorities, while an insufficient Yin year is joined with the Year Branch, both being termed &quot;Ping Qi.&quot;</p>
<p>Metal is represented as &quot;Shang,&quot; corresponding to the years of Yi and Geng. &quot;Shang&quot; signifies strength, referring to the resilient nature of Metal.</p>
<p>Water is referred to as &quot;Yu,&quot; corresponding to the years of Bing and Xin. &quot;Yu&quot; signifies comfort; as Yang energy begins to recover, all things grow and flourish.</p>
<p>Wood is called &quot;Jiao,&quot; corresponding to the years of Ding and Ren. &quot;Jiao&quot; signifies contact, symbolizing the emergence of Yang energy in a vigorous manner.</p>
<p>Fire is referred to as &quot;Zheng,&quot; corresponding to the years of Wu and Gui. &quot;Zheng&quot; signifies cessation, indicating that when things are abundant, they come to a halt.<a id="trans-614p" href="#orig-614p" class="marker">[614p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Seasons and Cycles</strong></p>
<p>Among the ten heavenly stems, there are five yin and five yang. These establish the five movements, which can become excessive or deficient, and mutually interact. In years of deficiency, the overcoming force comes to conquer, due to the emptiness of the cycle. Accordingly, there are certain years that align, and also certain years that correspond in mutual energy, as well as combinations of years and specific days, whereby they merge with the heavenly stems, which can provide assistance and are referred to as harmonious energy, achieving equilibrium in seasonal energy.</p>
<p>The growth and response of all things must harmonize without precedence or delay, and sages have established names to commemorate this. For example, in the year of Xin-Hai, when the water movement is at play, why is it said to be harmonious energy? Because Xin represents the water movement, and in the yin year, Hai corresponds to the northern water, thus the water energy becomes harmonious.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the year of Gui-Si, when the fire movement is present, it is also referred to as harmonious energy. Why? Because Gui represents the fire movement in the yin, and the year Si corresponds to the southern fire, thus the fire energy aligns harmoniously.</p>
<p>Each year initiates with the onset at the major cold day prior to the year. For instance, in the year of Ding-Hai, when the season&#39;s transition occurs, if it coincides with the day of the new moon and resonates with Ren, it is called the Heavenly Virtue Sign; &#39;sign&#39; means unity, thus establishing harmonious energy. If during the transition the encounter with Ren also represents the Heavenly Virtue Sign, after this initial point of energy overlap, there are no other mutual assistances.</p>
<p>The same pattern applies to the combinations; the so-called unions include Jia and Ji, Yi and Geng, Bing and Xin, Ding and Ren, and Wu and Gui. Further, in an yin year, if the month stem aligns, they complement and assist each other.<a id="trans-616p" href="#orig-616p" class="marker">[616p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one encounters the favorable elements without an association with the heavenly stems, it is still a balanced year. If one succeeds the previous winner and again encounters a combination of the heavenly stems, one achieves the rightful position. Therefore, a year of balance cannot be predetermined. The ten heavenly stems are arranged with yin and yang years to facilitate understanding. The balance of the year must be calculated according to the specific day and time of that year. Hence, the year of the Great Horn is termed &quot;Emergence&quot; (Excess), the year of the Lesser Horn is termed &quot;Harmonization&quot; (Insufficient), and the year of the Right Horn is termed &quot;Abundant Harmony&quot; (Balanced). The Great Zheng year is called &quot;Brilliant Radiance&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Zheng year is &quot;Hiding Brightness&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Zheng year is &quot;Ascending Peace&quot; (Balanced). The Great Palace year is termed &quot;Rich and Abundant&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Palace year is &quot;Low Monitoring&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Palace year is &quot;Prepared Transformation&quot; (Balanced). The Great Merchants year is called &quot;Strong Completion&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Merchants year is &quot;Following Change&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Merchants year is &quot;Carefully Balanced&quot; (Balanced). The Great Feather year is termed &quot;Flowing and Spreading&quot; (Excess), the Lesser Feather year is &quot;Dried Flow&quot; (Insufficient), and the Right Feather year is &quot;Calm and Orderly&quot; (Balanced). Each of these years reflects the balanced energy, correlating with the right transformations, without excess or insufficiency. Additionally, during the era of excess, if the energy is suppressed by celestial forces, it still counts as balanced; thus, the record of Radiance includes the years when the cold water governs the sky (Wu Chen, Wu Xu) and the years when the two fires govern the sky (Geng Zi, Geng Wu, Geng Yin, Geng Shen); all are years of balanced energy.<a id="trans-617p" href="#orig-617p" class="marker">[617p]</a></p></div>

<p>The influence and energy, whether Tai (Great) or Sha (Lesser), are governed by the cycles of time and seasons, which wax and wane. When they reach the heavens, there is a corresponding effect of the five stars diminishing; when they descend to the earth, there is the evidence of the five pests consuming life. The transformations of the five grains, five fruits, five flavors, and five colors vary; is there not one year that lacks any of these? It is merely about the abundance of maturity and the richness or thinness of color and taste. The Five Elements—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—coexist, with their transformations experiencing different states of prosperity and decline. In a Yang year, the energy is strong and excessive; in a Yin year, the energy is weak and insufficient. In times of excess, one who is strong seeks to harmonize with what is stronger; in times of deficiency, one who is weak is overtaken by the stronger energy. </p>
<p>In years of excess, Wood (Ren) aligns with Metal transformation; Metal (Geng) aligns with Fire transformation; Fire (Wu) aligns with Water transformation; Water (Bing) aligns with Earth transformation; and Earth (Jia) aligns with Wood transformation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The five elements, with their respective heavenly stems and earthly branches, vary from year to year based on fortunate or unfortunate encounters. For instance, when fire encounters fire or cold water, it generally corresponds to a yang year governing the heavens, while moist earth and dry metal, along with windy wood, typically align with an yin year in celestial governance. </p>
<p>Within a cycle of sixty years, there are various upper and lower influences at play; sometimes the heavens prevail over fortune, other times fortune outweighs the heavens. Occasionally, fortune may exceed what is appropriate, leading to excessive indulgence in areas where one ought to exercise restraint, or the fortune may fall short, avoiding areas where one prevails, failing to integrate its transformation. </p>
<p>As for the celestial symbols of the Great Unity, the annual associations with the heavenly symbols and their respective meetings have been detailed in other texts, so I will refrain from elaborating further. </p>
<p>According to the classics: when energies are in harmony, they synchronize. This includes the combinations of wood and fire, metal and water, water and wood, fire and earth, and earth and metal, all of which promote the generation of lower energies from the upper ones, allowing the heavens to influence fortune. Therefore, they are compatible. When they are incompatible, illness occurs, as seen in combinations where wood and earth meet, earth and water meet, water and fire meet, and fire and metal meet; in these cases, the upper elements suppress the lower, leading to disharmony and illness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when earth encounters fire, fire encounters wood, wood encounters water, and metal encounters earth, this results in fortune nurturing the upper realm, with lower energies opposing the upper, hence causing minor ailments. Similarly, if wood occupies positions of metal and earth, and fire occupies positions of metal and water, with earth in the positions of water and wood, and metal in positions of fire and wood, it indicates that fortune represses the heavenly influences, or vice-versa; such situations lead to disharmony, consequently resulting in significant illness. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Annual Balance Song</strong></p>
<p>Balance is carefully adjusted over the years, not merely lacking timeliness. In yang years, the heavens suppress movement, while in yin years, movements align with the year&#39;s branches. If in a yang year of Wu Chen fire is excessive, and water governs the heavens, suppression leads to balance. In a yin year of Gui Si, fire is insufficient, yet Si belongs to fire; with its assistance, balance is also achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive Five Movements Song</strong></p>
<p>The upper feather correctly corresponds, as Wu fire encounters water energy. The upper Zheng corresponds correctly, as Geng metal&#39;s fire movement is. The designation of upper Zheng refers to the years encountering excess or insufficiency, based on the original movement being less; the Heavenly governance energy is above, which might surpass its proper form, thus transforming and aligning perfectly, not merely superior. Therefore, when the self is excessive, the upper part suppresses for balance, hence the upper energy resonates in harmony with the proper energy.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Five Movements Combined with Heavenly Support Song</strong></p>
<p>The upper Jiao coincides with the proper Jiao, as Ding movement wood governs the heavens. The upper Gong coincides with the proper Gong, as Ji movement earth energy is suspended. The upper Shang coincides with the proper Shang, as Yi movement metal energy flows.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Sound Movement Overpowers with Heavenly Support and Transformation Song</strong></p>
<p>Wood energy movement encounters self, the upper Jiao appropriately aligned. Earth energy movement encounters Xin, the upper Gong appropriately overlaps. Metal energy movement encounters Ding, the upper Shang properly corresponds. When the superior self is dominant, transforming aligns thus, hence the proper sound follows the heavenly governance.<a id="trans-623p" href="#orig-623p" class="marker">[623p]</a></p></div>

<p>Someone has said: In the fourth year of Yuanfeng, during the year of Xin You, the Yang Ming governs the heavens for the upper commerce, while the Shao Yin resides in the spring for the lower military. The weather is dry and the energy of the earth is hot. The operation benefits from the lesser wings, but the water of the year does not reach its potential, which is called the record of drained streams, yet the river reverses and floods arise; what is the reason? It is said: The operation of the lesser angle is that the annual wood does not reach its potential, and the one that insults and rides upon it is metal. Metal does not pursue virtue, hence dryness overcomes wind. At that time, the white dew descends early, the energy is harvested early, its transformation leads to desolation, and its disaster causes sudden collapse, named the lesser angle, yet it truly aligns with the year of Tai Shang.</p>
<p>The operation of the lesser military is that the annual fire does not reach its potential, and the one that insults and rides upon it is water. Water does not pursue virtue, hence cold overcomes heat. At that time, cold tears fall, the earth accumulates hard ice, its transformation leads to chilling, and its disaster brings frost and hail, named the lesser military, yet it truly aligns with the year of Tai Yu.</p>

The victorious reverting signifies imbalance in energies and the mutual detriment among the five phases.

Those in ancient times who understood this well and adeptly nurtured life never failed to align with the fluctuating fullness and emptiness, managing the divine with the path!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Seeing the Diagram</strong></p>
<p><strong>Victory and Defeat Are the Same Song</strong></p>
<p>The victory and defeat do not match the years; when the fate declines, victory over oneself will surely add to the mistakes. The mother’s rivalry and the child’s prosperity must return; the child transforms with time and can again achieve victory. Just as in the case of the Ding year, wood does not surpass gold; when pure transformation arrives, fire becomes the return, reversing the heat to win over gold. I follow this pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Victory and Defeat</strong></p>
<p>Fate has its ups and downs, and energy has its fullness and emptiness, thus responding to each other according to the years. Therefore, the classics say: &quot;What is surplus should not go forth; what is insufficient thus follows after.&quot; Hence, the changes of too much and too little in the alternation of victory and defeat arise. When the excess is too great, the primordial celestial changes occur, with energy winning over reality, leading to the vanquished being afflicted. When the deficiency is too great, the post-celestial changes arise, and diminishing energy leads to those who win becoming conquerors. After being vanquished, one must wait for the right time to return. When returning to what has been conquered, one cannot advance, so one must wait until the right moment arrives for the child to flourish, then the child becomes the mother’s rival again. For instance, in a year of wood with few horns, when the pure metal transforms and wins, the child fire becomes the return; also, the return won is fire winning over gold, thus it is stated that victory and defeat are the same. Reversing heat wins over gold as well. When the fire is scarce in its transformation, and in a year where cold water wins due to the chill, the child earth becomes the return, reversing humidity to win over water. When the earth is scarce in its palace, and wood transforms with the wind winning in a year, the child metal becomes the return, reversing purity to win over wood. When metal is scarce in its commerce, in a year where hot fire wins due to heat, the child water becomes the return, reversing cold to win over fire. When water is scarce in its feathers, and in a year where damp earth wins due to humidity, the child wood becomes the return, reversing wind to win over earth.<a id="trans-628p" href="#orig-628p" class="marker">[628p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, the statement about victory and recurrence being the same refers to this. The &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; discusses the six energies, which have the authority of positive transformation and counter-transformation. If the authority of the positive transformation is substantial, victory occurs without recurrence; if the authority of the counter-transformation is insubstantial, victory may occur but recurs slightly. If victory is great, recurrence is also great; if victory is slight, recurrence is likewise slight, hence the saying about the transformation of evil energies.</p>
<p>It is said that the great energies have varying degrees of victory and recurrence. When these energies do not align, it leads to evil energies entering people and illness. However, the energies of heaven and earth also operate in victory and recurrence; thus, the classics state that the initial energy reaching the three energies is governed by heaven, representing the constant of victory. When the four energies conclude, it is governed by earth, representing the constant of recurrence. Indeed, victory arrives, then recurrence follows; if recurrence occurs, then victory arises, thus there is no permanence. When the energies cease to recurrently overpower, it signifies that the life force has been exhausted, hence the phrase about harming life. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if seasonal energies are excessive, those unable to achieve victory suffer from evil. Should they seize the essence and deceive those they cannot overcome, while the energies do not reach those they should overcome, they will be attacked by those unable to be defeated, leading ultimately to the reception of evil, thus misfortunes arise from not having energies superior to their own. Therefore, the classics say that what one humiliates will return as evil; this is what is meant. If this does not happen uniformly, it depends on the climate to differentiate.<a id="trans-629p" href="#orig-629p" class="marker">[629p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Song of the Transformation of Pre-Heaven and Post-Heaven</h3>
<p>When the Qi is excessive, the transformation of Pre-Heaven occurs. When the Qi is insufficient, the transformation of Post-Heaven takes place. The operations and transformations should be refined and distinctive, allowing the Qi to flow according to the appropriate order of before and after. Post-Heaven is influenced by what cannot be reached, while the excessive belongs primarily to Pre-Heaven.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Sixty-Year Guest Qi</h3>
<p>When the celestial bodies are in the Spring, the various seasonal Qi marks move in cycles, each governing sixty days and eighty-seven and a half units of time. The guest Qi follows the heavenly decree above the main Qi, hence there arise different transformations: warmth and coolness, cold and heat, twilight and bright days, wind, rain, frost, snow, lightning, hail, and thunder. The warmth of spring and the heat of summer, the coolness of autumn and the cold of winter—these seasonal commands cannot entirely be due to luck and Qi alone; therefore, there must be significant variations appropriate to the time. By laying out these sixty guest Qis beneath the main positions, one recognizes the great principles governing Qi’s location. The celestial symbols of the yearly cycle harmonize and balance the Qi’s branches and stems, where reverse and normal Qi spawn and overcome one another; guests can surpass the host, and calamities can vary in nature. Changes of fortune might either flourish or be stifled, and auspicious omens contrast with disasters, each differing uniquely. When Qi is at its peak, it may become excessive, leading to calamity. Thus, when Qi reaches its utmost, it reverses. This is why the inherited Qi resides below to ride upon it, as referenced in the teachings regarding the mutual fire beneath, where water Qi holds it up. There is also the Qi perceived from above, corresponding to the lesser Yang, where fire Qi governs it, as indicated by the lesser Yin. The principle is that when Yang is at its extreme, Yin emerges, and when Yin is at its extreme, Yang emerges; this is the marvel of mutual assistance. The Qi perceived in this way involves the transformations of the six organs of the body working together. Among Heaven and Earth, Qi accordingly responds.<a id="trans-630p" href="#orig-630p" class="marker">[630p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Six Energies of Heaven and Earth</strong></p>
<p>The energies of the Five Elements and Yin-Yang spread to the eight directions. Indeed, the energy of heaven descends while the energy of earth ascends. The energy of the earth is calm and constant, while the energy of the heavens is dynamic and ever-changing. The source of the six energies is the same, but their manifestations differ. Why is this? It is because the energies of heaven and earth begin with Shaoyin and end with Jueyin. The classic states that Shaoyin is the beginning, while Jueyin is the end. The energy of the earth starts with Jueyin Wood and concludes with Taiyang Water. The classic states, &quot;On the side of clarity, this is the position of the ruling Fire.&quot; Therefore, the six energies of heaven, along with the twelve earthly branches, correspond to the Five Elements and transform accordingly. Thus, Shaoyin governs the Zi and Wu hours, Taiyin governs the Chou and Wei hours, Shaoyang governs the Yin and Shen hours, and Yangming governs the Mao and You hours. And so it is.<a id="trans-631p" href="#orig-631p" class="marker">[631p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The six energies of the Earth combined with the four seasons of Heaven are correlated to wind, heat, summer, moisture, dryness, and cold. The Jueyin (Liver) represents spring, the Shaoyin (Heart) signifies late spring and early summer, the Shaoyang (Triple Burner) governs summer, the Taiyin (Spleen) oversees late summer, the Yangming (Large Intestine) takes charge of autumn, and the Taiyang (Kidney) rules winter. The causes for the start and end of the Earth’s energies are thus. </p>
<p>The texts say: Heaven has Yin and Yang; the Earth also has Yin and Yang, from their mutual presence above and below. The energy of Heaven is dynamic and never still, thus it migrates every five years to the right; the energy of the Earth is calm and maintains its position. If the energy of Heaven does not increase the fire of the ruler, then every five years one energy remains, migrating above the fire of the ruler, because the fire of the ruler does not establish a year.</p>
<p>The cycles of the Earth are complete every five years, while the cycles of Heaven are fulfilled every six periods. When five years pass, the energies of the five elements are widespread; through the six periods, the positions of the six energies are complete, somewhat similar to the interactions of the heavenly stems and earthly branches. Yin and Yang intertwine. The mutual enhancement of above and below conveys the intent of fulfilling their cycles. With the combination of five and six, a cycle is completed every thirty years, leading to a total of sixty years. </p>
<p>This corresponds to the diagram of the interaction of the six energies over time.<a id="trans-632p" href="#orig-632p" class="marker">[632p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Heavenly Sigil</strong></p>
<p>The one who governs the heavens is the one who directs, commanding the decrees of heaven from a high position; the cyclical years refer to the movement that governs the transformative energies of all beings between heaven and earth, positioned in the middle; while the one in the springs governs the transformations of the earth, positioned below. Within a year, these three energies—upper, middle, and lower—each enact their transformative decrees. When the energies resonate and converge, they align in their transformations. Even without any significant changes, there can be distinct variations in ailments, whether subtle or severe. This is known as the celestial sigil of the year: when the heavenly energy and the middle energy of the year are in harmony, it is called the Heavenly Sigil, symbolizing unity.</p>
<p>Within the twelve years, there are also those that coincide with the five elements of the twelve pitches of that year, indicated as the Great Yin Heavenly Sigil. The term &quot;Great Yin&quot; is a title of reverence. It refers to three connections: the heavenly connection, the yearly connection, and the cosmic connection. During the four years, regardless of whether they are yin or yang years, all are termed under the heavenly sigil as enforcement of law, with the yearly connection enacting the decrees, and the Great Yin Heavenly Sigil representing the noble ones. For those in between, the enforcers of the law may face rapid and severe ailments, while those following the decrees may experience gradual and enduring sickness. For the noble ones, their ailments may come abruptly and lead to death, for the energy decrees are profound among the intermediary ones.</p>
<p>When the yearly connection aligns with the pitches but not with heavenly decrees, it refers to the enforcement of decrees—representing one who does not possess the authority of law enforcement, thereby suffering no rapid danger from illness, but merely enduring it.<a id="trans-636p" href="#orig-636p" class="marker">[636p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on the Yearly Meeting</strong></p>
<p>In a given year, the interaction of the ten heavenly stems with the twelve earthly branches and the five elements is referred to as the Yearly Meeting, which signifies the balance of energies. Therefore, it does not distinguish between yin years and yang years but rather takes the middle of the four seasons—specifically, the first month of the year—as the foundation for the four clear months of the cycle. The positions of Zi (Rat), Wu (Horse), Chen (Dragon), and Xu (Dog) represent this. The earth has no fixed position; instead, it contributes to the flourishing of the four seasons towards the end of each. If there are significant occurrences every eighteen days, then it is said that the discussion of the cycle embraces the zodiac signs of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei.</p>
<p>Externally, there are four years: Ren Yin (Water and Wood) signifies yang years, while Geng Shen (Metal) also signifies yang years, making them two yang years. Gui Si (Water and Fire) and Xin Hai (Metal and Water) signify yin years, resulting in two yin years. Hence, the movement aligns with the yearly zodiac signs, which is not considered a Yearly Meeting because it does not conform to the principal decree of the four years.</p>
<p>Excluding the two yang years, the two yin years, Gui Si and Xin Hai, while not designated as Yearly Meetings, also align in their five elements and collectively represent a balanced energy year. The emergence of all things corresponds to a unified cycle; thus, there are no precedents or sequences in timing. Within the eight years of the Yearly Meeting, the four years that align with the deity of weather have already entered the great Taiyi celestial symbol.<a id="trans-637p" href="#orig-637p" class="marker">[637p]</a></p></div>

In sixty years, there are four years of the Great Yin Heavenly Talismans, twelve years of heavenly talismans, eight years of year assemblies, six years of the same heavenly talismans, and six years of the same year assemblies.

There are variations in actions, degrees of illness, and timings of life and death. By consulting the texts, one can discern these patterns. A &quot;talisman&quot; means a convergence. &quot;Great Yin&quot; is a term of reverence. Only the signs of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei preside over the true central positions of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, which govern year assemblies; the others do not represent the precise convergence.

<hr>
<p>&quot;Seeing the diagram, the Celestial Talisman of Taiyi and the Celestial Talisman Year: The meeting of the Celestial Talisman together with the year’s branches, the three positions mutually referring to the Taiyi Talisman. When the luck combines with the year branch, it is called the Year Meeting, and the four pillars of Earth must follow the same path. When in the spring coinciding with luck, the Yin is the same as the year, while the Yang corresponds to the Celestial Talisman calling out. Only regarding the Celestial Talisman, what does it signify? The management of Heaven in conjunction with luck is its distinction.</p>
<p>The Talisman of Dry Virtue: Regardless of whether there are diagrams, reading its song will make its meaning clear; thus, it is recorded here. </p>
<p>When neither the year nor the month matches with the Talisman of Dry Virtue, it won’t encounter the vigorous energy and will also be moderate. After surpassing the vigor, the original energy will then appropriately obtain the position of virtue. The year before, during the major cold at the beginning of energy transition, the day’s Talisman combines with the year’s Talisman position. During the transition of energy, if they combine, both will be peaceful energy. </p>
<p>[Note: For example, in the Year of Ding You, if the Wood energy does not prevail, the Metal energy is strong. In the first month, when Ren combines with Ding, this Wood encounters a dominance. In the Year of Ji Mao, if the Earth energy is weak, it falls under Wood dominance; with Metal returning, in the ninth month, when Jia combines with Ji, the Earth returns to its position. After surpassing the previous vigor, it also means finishing after surpassing the original energy. The year, day, and time exclude the beginning of energy transition; the rest may encounter but do not assist each other. Combining means when Jia and Ji join together is an example.]&quot;</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Channels of the Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>The classics state that the five organs and twelve meridians are all connected to the influences of the heavens. This discusses the three Yin and three Yang channels of the hands and feet. The twelve channels run externally along the body&#39;s form and internally connect to the organs, corresponding to the twelve months and thus the twelve sections. The five organs are Yin, and the six bowels are Yang. One Yin and one Yang together form a unity, thus the concept of the Six Harmonies.</p>
<p>The Lesser Yin channel, governing the heart and kidney organs, is associated with the heart&#39;s element of fire, while its pathway lies mainly in the kidney. Furthermore, the Heart fire presides at noon, and its transformation occurs at midnight, which is why the kidney, as a Lesser Yin organ, is also ruled by it. The five organs are Yin, and it is inappropriate to speak of them as Yang. Water flows from the kidney, so the Taiyang corresponds to the bowels; hence the Hand Taiyang is the small intestine, and the Foot Taiyang is the bladder.</p>
<p>The Great Yin channel governs the spleen and lung organs. The spleen, associated with the Yin earth element, correlates with the Great Yin pathway found in the lungs. Earth generates metal, and thus the fetus resides with the mother, which is why the lung, as a Great Yin organ, commands this relationship. Metal follows the lung; therefore, the Yangming corresponds to the bowels; thus, the Hand Yangming is the large intestine, and the Foot Yangming is the stomach.<a id="trans-640p" href="#orig-640p" class="marker">[640p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The channel of Jueyin governs the liver and the pericardium. The liver belongs to wood and generates fire. Since the child follows the mother, the pericardium, which is governed by Jueyin, takes precedence. The fire follows the pericardium, hence Shaoyang corresponds to the organs; thus, the hand Shaoyang (San Jiao) and the foot Shaoyang (Gallbladder) are established. The channels of the hands and feet originate from both hands and feet respectively. In terms of the twelve earthly branches, yin is born in noon, which leads to the creation of the hand channels; yang is born in the rat, thus giving rise to the foot channels, serving as a record of upper and lower. Furthermore, the heart and lungs, together with the pericardium, are located above and belong to the hand channels; the liver, spleen, and kidneys are below and belong to the foot channels, which also conveys the same meaning. The organs and viscera share the hand and foot channels, forming a unity. The pericardium is not an organ, nor is the San Jiao an organ. The scripture states: &quot;The zhongwan area is the deputy official, where happiness and joy emerge.&quot; Located in the chest, between the two breasts, it is the sea of qi, but it serves as the ruler. The San Jiao functions as the bureaucratic official for the drainage, the pathway for water emerges from here. The San Jiao is named but formless, connecting the heart above and the right kidney below, governing the pathways of various qi, which are referred to as messengers.<a id="trans-641p" href="#orig-641p" class="marker">[641p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the classic teachings, lust and resentment can overpower one if there are too few principal and guest influences present, revealing varying depths of evil within individuals. Moreover, susceptibility to external forces is simply a matter of one&#39;s constitution. Human beings, imbued with the energies of the five elements, are similarly bound by their limits. If one regulates their daily life, fosters health, and avoids malevolence while maintaining righteousness, untimely calamities can be avoided. </p>
<p>However, the seven emotions can internally disturb us, and the six external influences can affect us, leading to numerous ailments and the emergence of various diseases. Additionally, pursuing fame and fortune, indulging in desires, exhausting oneself through labor, and experiencing hunger or satiation, along with exposure to temperature extremes, braving the elements, violating taboos, and undermining one’s true spirit—these factors can surely lead to early death. It is thus to take responsibility for oneself. </p>
<p>The classics state: &quot;If one does not know how to maintain balance, is not timely in appeasing the spirit, and relentlessly seeks to satisfy their own desires, this is what will occur.&quot; </p>
<p>Indeed, the malevolent energies of heaven can harm one&#39;s internal organs, while the heat and cold of food can affect the six bowels. The extremes of dryness and moisture can damage the skin, flesh, and sinews. Joy and anger can injure one&#39;s vital energy, while the extremes of heat and cold can harm one&#39;s physical form. Hence, it is understood that the fluctuations of illness stem from within us. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if one is in a year of depletion, loses harmony with the times, or encounters a month of emptiness, then one is more susceptible to malevolent forces. If one is heavily affected by these evils, the risk of severe illness increases. Nevertheless, when the energies of the cosmos interact harmoniously, beneficial influences lead to health; discord leads to sickness. When epidemics arise, impacting one region or another without regard to size, this is indeed a matter of celestial influences. However, if one’s true vital energy is robust, daily activities are timely, and actions do not clash with external influences, even an epidemic will have minimal effect. This is why sages have cultivated methods for promoting life and refining the spirit.<a id="trans-643p" href="#orig-643p" class="marker">[643p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the relationship between the five movements and six atmospheric conditions of heaven and earth and their effects on human health. It explains that a person’s five internal organs correspond to the five elements and the yin-yang energies of the universe, thus being influenced by their fluctuations. Wang Bing believed that the energies distributed by the heavens do not exceed the five elements, suggesting that humans, being within these energies, must be aligned with the way of heaven. Therefore, it is only natural for health to vary with the changing conditions of yin and yang.</p>
<p>The text further explains how the seasonal energies can lead to various ailments, noting specific illnesses associated with each season: cold injuries in winter, heat-related illnesses in spring, summer discomfort, and autumn illnesses. These seasonal energies differ by region, resulting in different diseases. Hence, the text advocates for diverse therapeutic approaches tailored to the specifics of each illness.</p>
<p>Moreover, it acknowledges that certain diseases may occur independent of the annual climatic patterns, suggesting that practitioners should investigate the symptoms carefully without becoming overly fixated on climatic influences.</p>
<p>The &quot;Song of Diseases from the Six Qi&quot; describes various ailments associated with the six qi: </p>
<ul>
<li>Jueyin (Liver) conditions present with soft contractions and urgent pain, nausea, and diarrhea.</li>
<li>Shaoyin (Kidney) conditions exhibit cold and heat-related skin lesions, anxiety, sorrow, laughter, delusions, and neglect.</li>
<li>Taiyin (Spleen) presents as fluid retention and fullness, heavy limbs, swelling, and cholera.</li>
<li>Shaoyang (Gallbladder) issues include throat obstructions, sneezing, nausea, tinnitus, overflow, anxiety, and pain.</li>
<li>A sudden attack leads to confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, severe illness, and sudden death.</li>
<li>Yangming (Large Intestine) conditions may involve sneezing, rashes, and severe pain in the buttocks and thighs.</li>
<li>Taiyang (Bladder) conditions involve sweating, which is influenced by bending or stretching, leading to back pain.</li>

<p>The energies of the host and guest can both lead to illness. The lower energy is that of the host, and the upper energy is that of the guest. The classic states: The host of wood is addressed with sourness for purging and with spiciness for replenishing; the guest of Jueyin is replenished with spiciness, purged by sourness, and eased by sweetness. The host of fire is addressed with sweetness for purging and with saltiness for replenishing; the guest of Shaoyin is purged by sweetness and collected by sourness; the guest of Shaoyang is replenished by saltiness, purged by sweetness, and softened by saltiness. The host of earth is purged by bitterness and replenished by sweetness; the guest of Taiyin is replenished by sweetness, purged by bitterness, and eased by sweetness. The host of metal is purged by spiciness and replenished by sourness; the guest of Yangming is replenished by sourness, purged by spiciness, and eased by bitterness. The host of water is purged by saltiness and replenished by bitterness; the guest of Taiyang is replenished by bitterness, purged by saltiness, made firm by bitterness, and moistened by spiciness. These are the supplementary and purging actions of the six energies between host and guest. If the guest is victorious, then the guest should be purged and the host replenished; if the host is victorious, then the host should be purged and the guest replenished, responding according to what is urgent and what is gentle in treatment. Furthermore, the classic contains six energies that manage the heavenly influences in treatment for excess or deficiency, as well as methods for medicinal foods appropriate to seasonal changes; thus, each situation is different, and remedies are tailored to the symptoms, following the natural order and regulating with the five flavors.<a id="trans-645p" href="#orig-645p" class="marker">[645p]</a></p></div>

Thus, there should be no concern about the accuracy of diagnosing ailments. Within the five elements, it is also necessary to address the stagnated energy by using methods to tap into the source of transformation. The &quot;Origins of the Pearl&quot; states that the Sun governs the heavens and should draw from the source of water in September; Yangming governs the heavens and should draw from the source of metal in June; Shaoyin and Shaoyang govern the heavens and should draw from the source of fire in March; Taiyin governs the heavens and should draw from the source of earth in May; Jueyin governs the heavens and should draw from the source of wood in the previous December. This method employs acupuncture to welcome and gather these energies. Therefore, it is said: Do not lose trust in the heavens, do not oppose the energies appropriately, do not hinder their strengths, and do not hinder their recovery.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are indeed methods for treatment that exist, yet diseases vary in duration and severity, with some being toxic and others not, all of which relate to the principles of treatment. Some might consider that in times of certain celestial influences, when wood is strong and earth weak, one should drain the liver and nourish the spleen and stomach, but this is not a universal principle. Why is that? Can everyone’s organs be the same? For example, if the liver Qi is deficient and the spleen Qi is excessive, under such celestial influences, the liver wood may become somewhat solid, bringing the spleen Qi into balance, thus achieving harmony. However, if one insists on draining the liver and supplementing the spleen, they would confuse what is deficient and what is excessive, depleting what is lacking while reinforcing what is abundant, leading to death; it is the physician who brings this about, failing to recognize their error and inadvertently worsening the patient’s condition. Why is this so? The principles of all things in the world are such that to increase them takes time, while to diminish them happens quickly. If one takes a medicine to achieve an effect, the results will be gradual and mild; but if one consumes something that triggers illness, the response is immediate. Thus, it is evident that while establishing is difficult, destroying is easy; should we not be cautious?<a id="trans-647p" href="#orig-647p" class="marker">[647p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those unfit for their positions are ill; those who interchange their positions are ill; those who lose their positions are in danger. This is the principle. However, in human life, although the five elements are complete within one body, vital energy is rooted internally and also ebbs and flows with the energy of heaven and earth. How can this be clarified? It can be likened to the pulse of spring as being gentle, summer as exuberant, autumn as light, and winter as heavy. People experience fortune and energy in life, and it is said they also experience illness through fortune and energy. The classics state: &quot;To go against this will cause transformation; transformation causes illness.&quot; Things respond according to their nature, and energy responds according to its nature; thus, one must observe the seasonal energy to distinguish them. </p>
<p>In the theory of common people&#39;s energies, it is said: when the sun&#39;s pulse arrives, it is robust and long; when the lesser yang&#39;s pulse arrives, it is sometimes sparse, sometimes dense, sometimes short, sometimes long; when the yangming pulse arrives, it is superficial, robust, but short. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; cites this and also discusses the three yin and three yang pulses, referring to their superficial and deep aspects as they emerge. The six pulses refer to the interactions of movement and energy, which properly align and respond at the time of their transformation. Therefore, the movement of the pulse does not remain the same; when energies and movements converge at the right time, without exceeding the balance, it is termed as normal.

The sovereign reveres the south and issues commands, while the four other positions serve as ministers and face north to receive the orders. This creates a distinction, reflected in human meridians corresponding to this arrangement. In the years of Jia and Ji, the two movements face south; thus, in terms of the meridian, the inch is in the south while the foot is in the north. The minor yin governs the heavens, with no correspondence in the two inches, establishing south as the superior and north as the inferior. </p>
<p>This is analogous to a man facing south receiving energy, as the foot pulse is often weak; whereas a woman facing north receives energy and thus has a robust foot pulse, as the yin energy descends, leading to no correspondence. In regards to the positions of the six energies, minor yin is central, with jueyin to the right and taiyin to the left—this cannot be altered. The minor yin governs the two inches of the foot, with jueyin governing the heavens at the right, thus the right side does not correspond, while taiyin governs the heavens at the left, consequently, the left side does not correspond either, based on Southern politics when discussing the measurements. </p>
<p>If one further examines through hand diagnosis, the yin sinks below, reversing becomes floating, and fine becomes extensive. Furthermore, the text states: the opposing inch signifies death, the intersection of yin and yang signifies death. One must first establish the year to understand its energy and observe the responses on both sides before discussing the reversals and alignments of death and life. Further examination is needed to distinguish its reversals, detailing its intersections, and only then is it possible to delve into the subtleties of life and death.</p>

<p>Discussing the physiological influences according to measurements shall not contradict the stated principles.</p>
<p>The text states: When yin and yang intersect, it leads to death. If the year is supposed to be yang, a pulse on the left will oddly present on the right; if the year is supposed to be yin, a pulse on the right will oddly present on the left. When both sides meet, this is called intersection. If the left is solely present, or the right is solely present, it is not responsive and does not qualify as intersection. Only in the years of Yin (Tiger), Shen (Monkey), Si (Snake), Hai (Pig), Chen (Dragon), Xu (Dog), Chou (Ox), and Wei (Goat) occurs this phenomenon. The text states: When measurements are reversed, it indicates death. If the year is supposed to be yin, the measurement should show a pulse at the wrist but appears at the finger; if the year is supposed to be yang, the measurement should show at the finger but appears at the wrist. When both measurements are reversed, it is termed as reversal. If only the wrist appears, or only the finger appears, it is not responsive and does not qualify as reversal. This phenomenon only occurs in the years of Zi (Rat), Wu (Horse), Mao (Rabbit), and You (Rooster). The essence of creation transforms accordingly; thus, qi and blood become chaotic and lead to illness. The text states: Firstly, establish the year to understand the qi; when both sides react, one can discuss the oppositions and harmonies of life and death. This serves as an example, with the same methods applying to other years. Inadequate practitioners confuse cold with heat, treating cold as heat, yet the pulse remains unchanged and heat sickness arises, then they treat heat as cold, yet the pulse reflects this and cold sickness again appears. How can one seek balance under such conditions? The reasons for premature death largely stem from this. </p>
<p>All three yin and three yang energies in charge of the heavens reside in the spring, governing the north-south dynamics, whether on the left or right. The pulse in both the wrist and finger should be downward; if they do not correspond closely, reversing the hand will show a sinking pulse as floating, turning fine into coarse.<a id="trans-652p" href="#orig-652p" class="marker">[652p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The interplay of the pulse at the wrist reveals death.</p>
<p>When the Taiyin governs the heavens, the yin pulse should ordinarily appear at the left wrist, but if it instead shows at the right, this means the yang pulse has shifted to the left wrist, indicating the intersection of yin and yang, which signifies death. If the left shows only the yin pulse and the right one is absent, or if the right shows only the yang pulse and the left is absent, this does not correspond to the yin energy and simply indicates illness. The same applies to both wrists. This phenomenon occurs during specific years: the years of Yin, Shen, Si, Hai, Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei.</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin governs the heavens, the yin pulse should appear at both wrists, but if it instead shows at both hands, this indicates that the yang pulse has shifted to both wrists, signaling a reversal, which signifies death. The same applies to both wrists. The interpretation of the pulses remains consistent as mentioned above.

<p>The southern and northern political measures of pulses are unresponsive in their diagrams.</p>
<p>[The pulse being unresponsive refers to where Yin resides, causing the pulse to be deep and thin, as it does not correspond to the original pulse. If one examines with their hands, then what was deep becomes superficial and what was thin becomes large. The measures of the inches and chi&#39;s have no upper or lower distinction; the use of &#39;upper&#39; and &#39;lower&#39; here serves to differentiate the southern and northern political authorities, where &#39;Tian&#39; reigns over &#39;Quan&#39;.]</p>
<p>[The song says: In the southern polity, the inch is above and the chi is below; in the northern polity, the inch is above and the chi below is hindered. The three Yin authorities of heaven do not respond above; at &#39;Quan&#39; below there is no response. The Tai Yin must examine the left inch and chi; the Jue Yin holds the right hand&#39;s measures. The Shao Yin pulse is associated with both inches and chi; this principle is subtle and truly difficult to understand.]</p>
<p>[Note: The unresponsive pulse specifically refers to the three Yin. However, since Shao Yin is the ruler, it governs both the two inches and two chi&#39;s.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Proper and Erroneous Transformations</h3>
<p>If the year of Jiazi belongs to fire, it is associated with heat transformation and is governed by heaven; Jia, associated with earth, corresponds to rain transformation and is governed by movement; and Yin, associated with metal, corresponds to clear transformation and is governed by the earth. Heat transformation, rain transformation, and clear transformation are all essential energies governed by heaven, movement, and earth, hence they are called proper transformations. Moreover, Jia is associated with the positive (yang) and signifies excess; when there is excess, there is neither triumph nor return, hence there is no erroneous transformation. Generally, when encountering a yang year representing excess, the five elements often indicate numerical values; thus, it is said heat transformation is seven, rain transformation is five, and clear transformation is nine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the year of Xinyin, associated with metal, it represents clear transformation governed by heaven; Xinyin water represents cold transformation and is governed by movement; and the Zi fire, representing heat transformation, is governed by the earth. Clear transformation, cold transformation, and heat transformation are all essential energies governed by heaven, movement, and earth, hence they are also called proper transformations. However, Xinyin water belongs to the negative (yin) and signifies insufficiency; when there is insufficiency, the transformation of earth into rain will inevitably oppose it. Weak water cannot withstand, and the water&#39;s offspring—the wooden wind transformation—will inevitably return to oppose and overpower the earth. Nevertheless, what is opposed by rain and transformed by wind are not the essential energies of heaven, movement, and earth, hence they are called erroneous transformations. Although rain transformation and wind transformation are not essential energies, one prevails and the other is defeated, making it an inevitable principle. Thus, in any year of insufficiency (yin year), where the five elements often indicate birthing values, it is said clear transformation is four, cold transformation is one, and heat transformation is two.<a id="trans-662p" href="#orig-662p" class="marker">[662p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Principal Movement of the Upper and Lower Elements Being Predominantly Lesser</strong></p>
<p>If in a given year, the element of Yang Earth governs as the Supreme Palace, then the Earth of the Supreme Palace is the main focus. Therefore, what is produced by the Supreme Palace and what comes from it both stem from the Lesser aspect, not the Supreme. Thus, what the Supreme Palace Earth produces is the Lesser Metal of Shàng, and what the Lesser Metal of Shàng produces is the Supreme Water of Yǔ; when it encounters Yǔ, it comes to an end. Additionally, what is produced by the Supreme Palace Earth is the Lesser Fire of Zhēng, and what the Lesser Fire of Zhēng produces is the Supreme Wood of Jiǎo; when it encounters Jiǎo, it also reaches a halt. In summary, in the case of a Yang year, the movements of the upper and lower elements are all derived from the Lesser, hence it is said that the Supreme and Lesser mutually generate each other.</p>
<p>Conversely, if in a given year the element of Yin Earth governs as the Lesser Palace, then the Earth of the Lesser Palace is the primary focus. In this scenario, what is produced by the Lesser Palace and what comes from it are both rooted in the Supreme, not the Lesser. Thus, what the Lesser Palace Earth produces is the Supreme Metal of Shàng, and what the Supreme Metal of Shàng produces is the Lesser Water of Yǔ; encountering Yǔ, it ends once more. Furthermore, what is produced by the Lesser Palace Earth is the Supreme Fire of Zhēng, and what the Supreme Fire of Zhēng produces is the Lesser Wood of Jiǎo; meeting Jiǎo, it likewise ceases. Therefore, in Yin years, the movements of the upper and lower elements are all drawn from the Supreme, thus it is again said that the Supreme and Lesser mutually generate each other.</p>
<p>Additionally, regardless of whether it is a Yang or Yin year, one writes an initial character under Jiǎo and a terminal character under Yǔ; for each year, the Wood of Jiǎo represents the initial movement, and the Water of Yǔ represents the terminal movement. This pattern remains consistent year after year, thus forming the principal movement. Just like the principal Qi, year after year, Wood signifies the initial movement and Water the terminal Qi, and this uniformity leads to it being termed the principal Qi.<a id="trans-663p" href="#orig-663p" class="marker">[663p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Disaster Palace Song:</strong></p>
<p>In years without sufficient fortune, there are positions of disaster palace. The yin and yang align with three, while five associates with the same. The seven numbers are few, mixed with the乙 (Yi) and 癸 (Gui) corresponding with nine, still using earth to support the second position of the Kun. The second is indeed the position of earth, not the number of disaster officials. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Nine Palaces’ Domains:</strong></p>
<p>It is said: In years when the five movements are insufficient, there are positions the disaster palace points to, thus one cannot make a blanket statement about disasters. The classics say: The nine stars hang brightly, the seven luminaries rotate, under heaven&#39;s dominion. The nine stars divide the domains, thus in less auspicious years it is said there are disasters in the three palaces; the eastern palace, representing the shock position, is under the jurisdiction of Tian Chong. In less favorable years, it is said there are disasters in the nine palaces; the southern chamber, where the departure position is overseen by Tian Ying. In less fortunate years, it is said there are disasters in the five palaces; the central chamber is under the authority of Tian Qin. The second palace, Kun position, is affiliated. In less advantageous years, it is said there are disasters in the seven palaces; the western chamber, where the joy position is governed by Tian Zhu. In less propitious years, it is said there are disasters in the one palace; the northern chamber, where the pit position is ruled by Tian Peng. </p>
<p>First, it discusses the aspect of fortune&#39;s insufficiency. According to the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Volume,&quot; it states: Tian Peng is associated with water, being the central palace; Tian Rui, associated with earth, is the responding palace. Tian Chong, associated with wood, is the central palace. Tian Fu, also associated with wood, is the responding palace. Tian Qin, associated with earth, is the central palace. Tian Xin, associated with metal, is the responding palace. Tian Zhu, associated with metal, is the central palace. Tian Ren, associated with fire, is the responding palace. Tian Ying, associated with fire, is the central palace. Then align this with the divisions in the nine provinces, namely Yan, Ji, Yan, Qing, Yang, Jing, Yu, Liang, Yong.<a id="trans-664p" href="#orig-664p" class="marker">[664p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Twelve Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches</strong></p>
<p>The first of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches is Jiazi. Yang precedes Yin, following the cycle. If Jiazi is Yang, then Yichou is Yin; Yang marries a Yang partner and Yin marries a Yin partner, as when Jiazi marries Yichou. Offspring are produced, meaning Jiazi gives rise to Renzi at an interval of eight, and Renzi produces Gengchen, all three being of the Metal element, which corresponds to the Zi. The other children have similar meanings. Next, Wuzi Fire produces three generations leading to Wood, Wood produces three generations leading to Water, Water produces three generations leading to Earth, and Earth culminates at three, then returning to Jiawu Metal which produces three generations leading to Wuwu Fire, completing the cycle of the twelve branches, each containing the five tones. For example, in the Zi branch, there are Jiazi Metal, Bingzi Water, Wuzi Fire, Gengzi Earth, and Renzi Wood. The Six Jias encompass sixty tones. The interval of eight does not refer to the eighth directly; for instance, Jiazi to Guichou encompasses ten positions concerning earlier ranks. This is known as the Law of Jia, and in the cycles, it does not reach full application for use. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Suwen&quot; chapter on the Subtle Principles, the Emperor said: &quot;I wish to know the six seasonal patterns of the heavenly way, and how do they reflect prosperity and decline?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;There are ranks above and below, and there are records left and right. Thus, to the right of Shaoyang, the Yangming governs; to the right of Yangming, the Taiyang governs; to the right of Taiyang, the Jueyin governs; to the right of Jueyin, the Shaoyin governs; to the right of Shaoyin, the Taiyin governs; to the right of Taiyin, the Shaoyang governs. This is known as the standard of Qi, which faces south and awaits it. Therefore, it is said to follow the order of heaven; during periods of prosperity and decline, we move and properly position ourselves, waiting correctly—this is what is meant. Above Shaoyang, the fire Qi governs, revealing Shaoyin in the center; above Yangming, the dry Qi governs, revealing Taiyin in the center; above Taiyang, the cold Qi governs, revealing Shaoyin in the center; above Jueyin, the wind Qi governs, revealing Shaoyang in the center; above Shaoyin, the heat Qi governs, revealing Taiyang in the center; above Taiyin, the damp Qi governs, revealing Yangming in the center. This is what is called the root. Below the root, the center reveals; below the revealed, the standard of Qi. The standard and the root are different, leading to various manifestations of Qi. In the &quot;Great Discussion of Essential Truth,&quot; the Emperor asked: &quot;How do the six Qi derive from different standards and roots?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;Qi comes from the root, from the standard root, and sometimes does not come from the standard root. Shaoyang and Taiyin come from the root; Shaoyin and Taiyang come from both the root and the standard; Yangming and Jueyin do not come from the standard root, but rather from the center. Hence, those that come from the root transform according to the root; those that come from the standard root have transformations based on the standard root; those that come from the center rely on the central Qi for transformation.&quot;<a id="trans-667p" href="#orig-667p" class="marker">[667p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Things are born and respond to the meridians; the qi transforms and each attains its normal state. However, if the seasonal qi is excessive or insufficient, there will be changes of victory and defeat, leading to the emergence of illnesses as people interact with the shifting energies around them. In treatment, there are distinctions among the fundamental, the symptomatic, and the intermediary. Although this discussion can be seen in the various writings on the dynamics of qi, it is essentially reflective of the relationships between the classics and the treatment of organ syndromes.</p>
<p>Examining the classics, one finds that the six transformations of heaven, characterized by cold, heat, dryness, moisture, wind, and fire, serve as the foundation, while the three yin and three yang positions serve as the markers. What is referred to as &#39;the middle seen&#39; reflects the interconnection of yin and yang, mutually influencing each other. Following the celestial order and the timing of flourishing and decline, one adjusts oneself to the correct position and awaits.</p>
<p>In this transformation of qi, reverence is shown; facing south is fundamental, responding to heaven above; beneath this foundation, the qi that is perceived to the north corresponds to humanity in the middle; and below this, the indicators of the lower three yin and three yang are placed, corresponding to the earth below.<a id="trans-669p" href="#orig-669p" class="marker">[669p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of the sign has not yet become clear. I foolishly speculate on this. The position of the sign corresponds to the six energies of the earth. For instance, the initial phase corresponds to the wind and wood, the second to fire of the two lords, the third to fiery heat, the fourth to moist earth, the fifth to dry metal, and ultimately to cold water. Since the responses below the earth’s energies differ, the influences of the three yin and three yang will also change accordingly. This illustrates the difference between the sign and the essence, leading to differing phenomena in their responses. Furthermore, in the principles of cosmic creation, yang represents advancement, hence nine signifies maturity; yin represents retreat, hence six signifies maturity. Therefore, wherever the essential energy resides, one must closely examine the yin and yang of its original position regarding advancement and retreat, always moving counterclockwise from wood and wind. When it manifests from the energy of the lower sign, it becomes the domain of the sign; thus, we can observe the essence and order of the three talents’ energies.<a id="trans-670p" href="#orig-670p" class="marker">[670p]</a></p></div>

For example, above the Shaoyang, the fire is the original essence, and within it, the Jueyin wood winds are observed; the wind serves as the middle essence while the Shaoyang stands as the representative. Thus, from the position of Shaoyang to Yangming, it is regarded as the initial earth essence of the wind and wood, proceeding left in sequence until reaching the lower representative position. At the convergence of the three energies, the fire responds to this, hence both the representative and the original are fire, and thus it follows the original fire. Similarly, above the Taiyin, the humid essence is the original, and within it, the dryness of Yangming gold is observed; dryness serves as the middle essence while the Taiyin stands as the representative. Thus, from the position of Taiyin to Shaoyin, it is regarded as the initial earth essence of the wind and wood, proceeding left in sequence until reaching the lower representative position. At the convergence of the four energies, the humid earth responds to this, hence both the representative and the original are humid, and thus it follows the original humidity.

Starting from the Taiyang on the left position of Yangming, one moves left in order, until reaching the lower mark position. When aligned with the four energies, the moist earth corresponds.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The differentiation between Yangming and Jueyin lies in their fundamental nature, considering the transformation through the central energy. All of this adheres to natural laws, which cannot be altered by human intention. In summary: Taiyin and Yangming are connected to dampness; Shaoyin and Taiyang pertain to heat and cold; Jueyin and Shaoyang relate to fire. </p>
<p>Now, discussing the treatment related to Taiyin and Yangming, when the hand Taiyin lung is affected by dampness, symptoms may include wheezing and a voice that sounds as if emerging from a jar; treatments involve the use of herbs like 腾苈 and 木通. Additionally, the foot Taiyin spleen can be affected by dampness leading to fullness, treated with pills like 大消痞丸. Symptoms such as limbs swelling and feeling like clay can be managed with formulas like 胃苓汤. For cases presenting with heaviness in the body and a desire to lie down, treatments may include herbs like 苍术 and 羌活. </p>
<p>Moreover, the foot Yangming stomach may also suffer from stagnation due to water intake, causing chest and abdominal fullness, or difficulties in swallowing water, treated with 五苓散 plus 半夏; in severe cases, herbs like 牵牛 and 甘遂 are employed. The Yangming stomach channel affected by dampness may lead to facial swelling, again treated with 苍术 and 羌活. In the case of hand Yangming experiencing dominance of dampness manifesting as diarrhea, the course of treatment would follow with formulas like 五苓散.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when treating Shaoyin and Taiyang through heat and cold, if the hand Shaoyin heart shows signs of heat and a lack of tranquility in the spirit, treatments may include朱砂安神丸. In cases involving sores or mid-day fevers where heat is present in the blood vessels, 黄连泻心汤 is often utilized.<a id="trans-674p" href="#orig-674p" class="marker">[674p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Laws: Sayings on Qi and Fate</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the physical world has constants and variations. What governs fate are the constants; deviations from what governs are all changes. The constant is like the original Qi, while the changes can be everywhere, thus each has its domain. Therefore, there are variations in responses such as following, opposing, excessive, insufficient, and so forth, each governed by different laws. For example, when the Yin energy is in effect, there is much wind and the plants flourish; this is called following. When the weather is clear and dry without wind, this is called opposing. When the sky is cloudy and the water does not freeze, this is called excessive. When strong winds break trees and there is chaos among clouds, this is called stagnant. When mountains and marshes are scorched and plants wither, this is called excessive. When extreme heat causes pests and locusts to become a plague, this is called recovery. When landslide or earthquakes occur during a time of dust and fog, this is called excessive. And when it is ominously dark with heavy clouds during the day, this is called insufficient. </p>
<p>One must respond quickly to changes as they occur, observing the conditions of the time and place. Even a difference of a few miles can lead to different climates and thus different responses; how could one cling to a fixed rule? </p>

However, the guest energies are not marked, which is why there are many interpretations. Some interpret the year of the Jiazi as starting at the first moment of water, the year of the Yichou as starting at the twenty-sixth moment, the year of the Bingyin at the fifty-first moment, and the year of the Dingmao at the seventy-sixth moment; these are referred to as guest energies. This is related to the four-part calendar system. How does the energy of great cold relate to the yearly cycle? Additionally, there is the fire from the south, supported by water, and the earth from below, supported by wind, which are also considered guest energies. These are still master energies and interact with the six terms, thus they cannot be purely guests. </p>
<p>Generally, what is referred to as guest occurs before the midpoint of the year, when heavenly governance is the master; after the midpoint, earthly governance is the master. The constant energies of the seasons act as the master, while the governance of heaven and earth acts as the guest. Disruption of the master energy leads to sudden harm, while disruption of the guest energy leads to gradual harm. Adjust the master and guest energies to avoid injury and disturbance; this is the method of managing energies. </p>

The conqueror&#39;s restoration indicates an imbalance of essences, leading to mutual harm among the five essences. When the essences are balanced and mutually beneficial, this is the way to maintain the norm; when the essences are unbalanced and harming one another, this is the way to observe change. Those of ancient times who understood this well and were adept at nurturing life, how could they not adjust to the fluctuations of fullness and emptiness according to the path to govern the spirit?</p>
<p>In the year ruled by the Sun, it is advisable to use bitterness and dryness, warming them. In the year ruled by Yangming, it is advisable to employ bitterness, spiciness to induce sweating, cleansing, dispersing, and also using salinity. In the year ruled by Shaoyang, it is advisable to use salinity; it is also suitable to use spiciness and sourness, to permeate, drain, soak, and stimulate, observing the cold and warmth in order to adjust its essence. In the year ruled by Taiyin, it is advisable to use bitterness and dryness, warming them; if severe, it is to stimulate and drain. If neither stimulating nor draining, the dampness overflows, leading to flesh decay and skin cracking, resulting in water and blood intermingling. In the year ruled by Shaoyin, it is advisable to use salinity to soften and adjust the upper body; if severe, use bitterness to stimulate and sourness to consolidate, thus calming the lower body; if extremely severe, use bitterness to purge. In the year ruled by Jueyin, it is advisable to use spiciness to adjust and sourness to moisten.<a id="trans-684p" href="#orig-684p" class="marker">[684p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The year begins with Yang. In the first month (Yin), it signifies the initiation. The energy of Lesser Yang starts beneath the spring, pulling Yang upward into the realm above Heaven, Earth, and humanity. At this time, all grains and plants have begun to sprout. By the time of the Lesser Yin of summer, the fire blazes in the vast emptiness, leading to flourishing vegetation, hanging branches, and spreading leaves, which exemplifies the use of Yang and the essence of Yin. This illustrates how Heaven produces Yang to nourish Yin.</p>
<p>The text states that before the midpoint of the year, the weather is governed by the ascending and floating energy. When autumn arrives, the operation of Great Yin begins from Heaven and descends, bringing forth阴 (Yin) that penetrates the earth. Consequently, metal stirs into dryness, winds become fierce, and frost descends, leading to the demise of various entities, leaving only barren branches, similar to the fur of a beast. In winter, the energy of Lesser Yin again lies dormant beneath the springs, with ice splitting the ground, and all things densely packed—this shows the application of Yin and the essence of Yang. This illustrates how the earth uses Yang to subdue and hide Yin.</p>
<p>The text mentions that after the midpoint of the year, the earth’s energy governs the descent and consolidation. In the great discussions of the celestial origins, it is stated that the branches and stems of the year manage the six energies, which clearly deviate from the teachings of the ancient sages. The branches and stems of the year are uniform across the world and invariant across the four seasons. The warmth, heat, cold, and coolness of the weather, the illnesses of the populace, the variations in the four directions, and the differences in the hypotheses of spring, summer, autumn, and winter—how could they all be the same? Such fallacies are evident.<a id="trans-685p" href="#orig-685p" class="marker">[685p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In recent times, the treatment for typhus is primarily based on the celestial stems and branches corresponding to the day of illness, which also derives from this principle. It must not be used indiscriminately. The energies of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth each govern a specific season—during their season, they are the dominant energy, presiding over the heavens; if their energy is present out of season, it is considered foreign energy; and if it is directly opposed to the season, it is termed as lying in the spring, meaning its energy is hidden beneath the yellow spring and thus not visible. </p>
<p>The treatment method involves using warmth for warmth and using cold for cold, as it is essential to acknowledge the seasonal energies and not disturb the harmony of the heavens. In spring, the wood energy presides, making all directions warm; in summer, the fire energy presides, making all directions hot; during the transition from summer to autumn, the earth energy presides, making all directions humid; in autumn, everything becomes cool; and in winter, everything becomes cold. The illnesses of the people often arise from this, which is an easily observable principle. Energies that oppose the season are termed foreign energies. Therefore, the treatment has concepts of using the opposing nature of energies. Observing this, the theory of circulating energies is indeed considerable.</p>
<p>For instance, the transformation of Taiyin rain is applied to the Yangming; the cold transformation of the Yangming is applied to the Shaoyin; the heat transformation of the Shaoyin is applied to the Yangming; the dryness transformation of the Yangming is applied to the Jueyin; and the windy transformation of the Jueyin is applied to the Taiyin. All excesses that prevail in us are our reality. Reality is true evil. Conversely, successes that prevail in others indicate our deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The distinction between the six vital energies refers to the concepts of existence and non-existence. However, although the movement of celestial bodies and vital energies can be categorized into five or six, the application of yin and yang boils down to water and fire alone. Therefore, when yang prevails, yin suffers, and when yin is dominant, yang suffers. One should drain the excess energy, addressing its presence, and nurture the depleted energy, addressing its absence. By seeking the fundamental source and probing its deeper meanings, resolving difficulties becomes as easy as picking up a stray hair.</p>
<p>If one does not understand the principles of order and disorder, fullness and emptiness, and instead firmly holds onto fixed ideas, it is like facing east yet not seeing the west wall, or facing south yet not perceiving the north. Observing a single curve does not allow for discussions on transformation, and focusing on one moment does not permit conversations about the larger picture, which inevitably leads to confusion and harm.</p>
<p>Among the six vital energies, three belong to yin: dampness, dryness, and cold. Two belong to yang: wind and heat. If fire lacks the transformative nature of the monarch, then yin overshadows yang, leading to death over life; thus, these two types of fire are essential. If one merely acknowledges the existence of two fires and concludes that yang is always excessive while focusing solely on its suppression, it disrupts the harmony of the heavens and undermines the foundation of life—nothing is worse than this. Such profound principles merit careful examination by scholars.</p>
<p>Wherever the three yang energies reside, there is an abundance of energy within those channels. Conversely, wherever the three yin energies are found, some channels may be unresponsive due to the deficiency in yang energy, indicating a lack of vitality.<a id="trans-687p" href="#orig-687p" class="marker">[687p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the arrangement of the three Yin, only the Lesser Yin stands alone in the center; this is the Yin among Yin. Therefore, the position of the Lesser Yin is one of non-response. In essence, it corresponds to the emptiness of heaven and earth; is it not said that the ruler oversees affairs? The principle of the five actions of overcoming and replenishing arises spontaneously. All things in heaven and earth inevitably reflect the five actions. If excess harms the regulation, how can it not take form? Thus, seeking within humanity, the five viscera balance each other, the five desires overcome each other, the five energies shift among themselves, and the five diseases transform into one another. Therefore, when fire is at its peak, cold arises; when cold is at its peak, dampness arises; when dampness is at its peak, wind arises; when wind is at its peak, dryness arises; and when dryness is at its peak, heat arises. This is all part of their transformation. The regulation in heaven and earth arises from the natural flow of energies, and it exists in humanity as well, where it pertains to the gains and losses of guidance and application. If one can understand its subtleties and grasp its principles, then control lies within oneself—what harm could there be? If the distinctions of prosperity and decline in regulation are unclear, and one cannot discern the true from the false, then chaos may indeed be anticipated. </p>
<p>Thus, when those of the Sun encounter flowing cycles, and those of the Moon meet with radiant epochs, the strong have regulation while the weak find support; the energies achieve their balance—what illness could there be? If the strong Yang encounters fire, then fierce heat arises; if cold Yin meets water, then frost and ice ensue. Heaven has its heavenly signs, the year has its yearly meetings; how can humanity obtain harmony without others?<a id="trans-688p" href="#orig-688p" class="marker">[688p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Explanation of the Laws in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of various diseases often stems from their root causes. The effects of the six qi can manifest either in the exterior or the interior. For instance, when there is cold water in the Taiyang, it is inherently cold while the exterior is hot; in the case of Shaoyin, the governing fire is intrinsically hot while the exterior is cold. Treatment may focus either on the root or the exterior, depending on the differentiation of cold and heat. </p>
<p>For the Shaoyang, the fire transforms into the root; for the Taiyin, the damp earth transforms into the root. Treatment should target the essence of the fire and dampness rather than the exterior signs of Shaoyang and Taiyin. In the Yangming, the dry metal transforms from dryness as the root; the Yangming represents the exterior. In the Jueyin, the wind wood transforms from wind as the root; the Jueyin represents the exterior. Treatment should not focus on the exterior signs but rather on the interior, which reflects the central qi. </p>
<p>Indeed, Yangming and Taiyin are interrelated, with their energies communicating internally; thus, treatment for dry metal is derived from the internal energy of damp earth. Likewise, Jueyin and Shaoyang are interrelated, actively interacting internally; therefore, treatment for wind wood is derived from the internal energy of corresponding fire. Furthermore, due to the incongruence between the exterior and the root energies in these two channels, treatment should be confirmed by the internal energies.<a id="trans-689p" href="#orig-689p" class="marker">[689p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we consider the interaction of the sun and the lesser yin as interdependent forces perceived in the environment, there are clearly distinct states of cold and heat that can be understood without seeking them internally. As for diseases, they all require treatment at their root. However, when it comes to issues of fullness and the difficulties of urine and feces, these are treated at the surface level. Fullness indicates a distended stomach; if the stomach is full, the energies of food and medicine cannot circulate, leading to a disruption in the organs and their functions. Thus, when unable to address the root, one must first treat the surface, as addressing the surface becomes fundamentally important.</p>
<p>When it comes to difficulties with urination and defecation, this signals an urgent condition. Among various diseases, there is none more pressing than this, so it must be treated first. Without addressing this, one cannot effectively manage other symptoms. </p>
<p>Additionally, the indicators of disease and their underlying causes differ. When a disease arises in excess, it inevitably affects other organs and energies; thus, one should treat the root first to prevent it from impacting other aspects. Conversely, when a disease arises from deficiency, it is likely to be burdened by other organs and energies, necessitating surface treatment first to avoid further complications to the primary organ or energy affected.</p>
<p>Just as in the case of diseases being the root and treatment methods being the surface, if practitioners do not assess the severity of the illness, and if the illness does not discriminate based on the efficacy of the treatment, then the relationship between root and surface becomes muddled.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Principle of Treating Illness Without Considering the Annual Qi</p>
<p>In treating illness, if one does not understand the waxing and waning of annual qi, or the true and false vitality of the person&#39;s qi, then the responsibility lies with the physician for mismanaging the balance of the pathology and the healthy state. Not knowing how the year influences qi&#39;s intensity or decline, nor understanding the origins of true or false vitality, renders one unskilled in the art. Indeed, without awareness of the annual cycles, one cannot grasp the fluctuations of human vitality. </p>
<p>If one neglects the timing and reverses the conditions, without distinguishing between the five phases, internal pathologies arise, and the physician cannot guard against them. Treating illness without recognizing the presence or absence of qi, and failing to recognize the proper timing, leads to a muddling of the seasonal influences, with no clarity in understanding their fluctuations. If harmful pathogens arise internally and afflict the individual, despite the physician&#39;s efforts, they will be unable to prevent it due to ignorance of the timing and qi.</p>
<p>Not understanding the relationship between the four seasons and the five elements, nor how they interact and counteract one another, leads to misconceived treatments that attack the wrong conditions and undermine a person’s true vitality, ultimately risking their life unknowingly. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the annual qi; one should not disrupt the heavenly harmony.<a id="trans-691p" href="#orig-691p" class="marker">[691p]</a></p></div>

Do not cause harm or lose what is proper, as this leads to the end of longevity for individuals. This is what the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; warns about in earnest; can learners not seek teachers to clarify? Indeed, the year has six seasonal energies that govern, with the southern and northern influences. Knowing these six energies, one can correspond to the pulse in dimension. In the case of the Taiyin, the pulse is deep; for Shaoyin, it is hooked; for Jueyin, it is taut; for Taiyang, it is large and long; for Yangming, it is short and slippery; for Shaoyang, it is large and superficial. This reveals that the six pulses reflect the harmony of heaven. Those who do not understand call them disease pulses, attacking cold to incite heat, but the pulse remains unchanged while heat sickness arises. Controlling heat to induce cold keeps the pulse the same, yet cold sickness occurs again. How can one seek harmony under such circumstances? The origins of untimely deaths often stem from this.
