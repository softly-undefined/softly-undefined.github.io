      <div><p>&quot;Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 189 of the Medical Section&quot;<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Four Limbs Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Clear Yang fills the four limbs, while turbid Yin returns to the six organs.<br><em>[Note: The four limbs serve as the support of all Yang, whereas the six organs transform and process substances without storing. This indicates that the clear Yang generated from food nourishes the four limbs, while the turbid substances return to the six organs. The spleen governs the four limbs and is said to uniquely receive the turbid. The clear within the turbid is transformed and transported by the spleen, nourishing the four limbs, while the turbid within the turbid returns to the six organs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The three Yang are in the head, the three Yin are in the hands, which is called unity.<br><em>[Note: The pulses of the three Yang flow from the hands to the head and from the head to the feet, hence the three Yang are in the head. The pulses of the three Yin flow from the feet to the abdomen and from the abdomen to the hands, hence the three Yin are in the hands. Although the twelve meridians are differentiated into hand and foot Yin and Yang, they are all interconnected as one.]</em> </p>
<p>When the three Yang and three Yin manifest illness, there is debilitation, paralysis, and inability to lift the limbs.<br><em>[Note: The three Yang and three Yin refer to diseases related to the Sun and Taiyin. Debilitation refers to hemiplegia. Paralysis refers to an inability to move as usual. The Yang of the Sun is the master of all Yang qi and governs the tendons. If Yang qi is deficient, there is debilitation; if Yang is deficient and cannot nourish the tendons, there is paralysis. The spleen is associated with the four limbs, thus there is inability to lift them. This relates to the water organ causing disease and reverse acting upon the spleen&#39;s earth.]</em> </p>
<p>The manifestation of excessive Yang results in swelling of the limbs.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Note: The disharmony of yin and yang leads to the formation of illness. The limbs are the foundation of all yang; when qi returns to the body and binds, it causes swelling.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the chapter on the generation of the five organs:</strong></p>
<p>The liver is associated with the tendons, its nourishment is in the nails, and it governs the lungs. <strong>Note: Marrow generates the liver, and the liver generates the tendons, hence its association with the tendons. The nails are an extension of the tendons, thus their nourishment is in the nails.</strong> When a person lies down, blood returns to the liver; the liver receives blood and enables vision, the feet receive blood and enable walking, the palms receive blood and enable gripping, and the fingers receive blood and enable grasping. <strong>Note: Blood moistens the tendons and bones, facilitating the joints. This indicates that the blood from the Chong and Ren channels returns to the liver, nourishes the eyes, circulates through the limbs, and pervades the fingers and palms, reaching everywhere.</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Discussion on the Vital Pulse</strong></p>
<p>The spleen pulse is firm and long, its color is yellow, indicating a condition of diminished energy; if it is soft and dispersed, with a color that lacks luster, it suggests swelling in the lower limbs resembling water.<br><strong>[Note: The original essence of the five organs is governed by the spleen. Excess heat and dampness lead to a yellow color and strong pulse yet little energy. The spleen’s deficiency causes lower leg swelling. If it resembles water but is not a water-related condition, its color lacks luster.]</strong><br>Pushing upwards, if it rises and does not descend, the waist and lower limbs are clear.<br><strong>[Note: Pushing upwards involves pressing with three fingers to examine. If it rises and does not descend, it indicates abundance of energy above and deficiency below, signifying coldness in the waist and lower limbs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Human Vitality</strong></p>
<p>A pulse in the wrist that is long relative to the hand indicates pain in the lower limbs.<br><strong>[Note: A long pulse in the wrist corresponds directly down to the forearm, indicating that a Yang pathogen is moving to the lower parts, hence the pain in the lower limbs.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Theory of the Genuine Organs</strong></p>
<p>Excessive spleen activity leads to the inability to lift the limbs.<br><strong>[Note: The spleen, which involves damp earth and governs energy, leads to the inability to lift the limbs if dampness is excessive.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Timing of Organ Energies</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Those with spleen diseases experience heaviness in the body, are prone to muscle atrophy, have feet that cannot retract, suffer from pain when walking, and experience foot pain. [Note: The spleen governs the muscles, and when spleen qi is damaged, the body feels heavy, and the muscles are prone to atrophy. The foot taiyin channel runs along the lower leg and knee; when there is evil in the channel, the feet cannot retract. When qi is damaged, this leads to pain.]</p>
<p>Those with lung diseases experience wheezing, coughing, reverse flow of qi, shoulder and back pain, sweating, and pain in the buttocks, inner thighs, knees, legs, and feet. If deficient, they experience shortness of breath and cannot breathe deeply; they may also suffer from deafness and a dry throat.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Concepts of Xu (Deficiency) and Shi (Excess)</strong><br>The Yellow Emperor asked: What is meant by deficiency and excess? Qi Bo replied: When pathogenic qi is strong, it leads to excess; when vital essence is taken away, it leads to deficiency. The Emperor asked: How do we identify deficiency and excess? Qi Bo said: When the qi is deficient, it indicates lung deficiency; when qi is reversed, it indicates cold in the feet. At the wrong time, this leads to life, while at the right time, it leads to death. This applies to all organs. [Note: Pathogenic qi can be mildly strong, hence strong evil leads to excess; vital qi has strengths and weaknesses, so when essence is taken, it leads to deficiency. When evil enters from the surface into the interior, the external qi, blood, and flesh may initially be consumed by the evil illness, hence when the flesh is slippery and strong, the evil does not invade internally, and the interior remains solid. If the surface qi is deficient, it harms the five organs, leading to a void inside; this delineates the deficiency and excess of both surface and interior. When qi is reversed upward, the lower body is deficient and the feet become cold; this indicates the deficiency and excess of both upper and lower parts. When it occurs during the time of flourishing growth, it brings life; when it occurs at the time of overcoming, it brings death; this addresses the seasonal aspects of deficiency and excess.] The Emperor asked: What is meant by heavy deficiency? Qi Bo said: When the pulse is weak at the wrist and the qi is deficient, this is termed heavy deficiency.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>The emperor said: How should it be managed? Qi Bo replied: What is meant by the emptiness of &quot;qi&quot; refers to its inconsistency. When the pulse at the wrist is empty, one walks unsteadily; when the pulse is weak, it does not resemble yin. In such cases, if it is slippery, it brings life; if it is dry, it leads to death.</p>
<p>[Note: The nutrient &quot;qi&quot; flows within the vessels, and the protective &quot;qi&quot; flows outside the vessels, hence it is called pulse &quot;qi&quot;. The pulse at the &quot;qi&quot; point can be used to assess blood as well as &quot;qi&quot;. The upper deficiency refers to the emptiness of pulse &quot;qi&quot; at the wrist. The lower deficiency refers to the emptiness of pulse &quot;qi&quot; below. When both upper and lower are empty, it is called &quot;heavy emptiness&quot;. &quot;Qi&quot; represents the protective and nourishing &quot;qi&quot; produced by the yangming, and when it is empty, it leads to a feeling of fear and weakness. If the &quot;qi&quot; of yangming is empty above, speech becomes inconsistent; if it is empty below, it makes one walk unsteadily. &quot;Qi&quot; flows from the taiyin to influence the hand of yangming, ascending to the foot of yangming, and descending to the ankles. Therefore, it is said that above the waist, both the hands of taiyin and yangming are in charge; below the waist, both the feet of taiyin and yangming are in charge. &quot;Qi&quot; is yang, while blood vessels are yin. The vital &quot;qi&quot; of yangming is yang, while the essence and &quot;qi&quot; of shaoyin are yin.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The essence of life arises from the connection of the pulse at the fingertips, responding to the vital energy of Yangming, rather than reflecting the emptiness of its Yin. Qi is generated from Yangming, with its origin in the kidneys. The minimal Yin energy rises to join with Yangming; when Yin and Yang clash, the pulse becomes slippery. Such interaction allows the essence of food and drink to transform into Qi, thus sustaining life. Excessive dryness indicates a lack of vital energy; when the origin of life is severed, it results in death.</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired: &quot;What if the pulse is firm and full, with cold hands and feet and a hot head?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Life prevails in spring and autumn, but death occurs in winter and summer. A floating pulse with dryness and a body that is warm indicates death.&quot; The Emperor asked: &quot;What if the body is completely full?&quot; Qibo responded: &quot;If the body is completely full, the pulse becomes rapid, large, and firm; the wrists are dry and unresponsive. In such a case, following leads to life, while resisting leads to death.&quot; The Emperor questioned: &quot;What does it mean to follow leads to life and resist leads to death?&quot; Qibo explained: &quot;To follow means having warm hands and feet; to resist means having cold hands and feet.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The kidneys govern the origin of vital energy, while the bladder is the house of the sun. A firm and full pulse indicates the cold Qi of the minimal Yin is abundant externally, while cold hands and feet indicate the vital energy of the minimal Yin is deficient internally.)<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>A hot head is the result of excess solar energy rising upwards. The kidneys and bladder, where yin and yang interact, govern the generation of vital energy; if this energy is abundant externally, it will become deficient internally. In spring, yang energy slightly rises while yin energy slightly descends; in autumn, yin energy slightly rises while yang energy slightly descends. The two energies of yin and yang nourish each other, which sustains life. In winter, yin energy is completely externalized, and in summer, yang energy is fully deficient internally, leading to death. This indicates that the root energy of yin and yang should not be depleted. If the pulse is superficial and weak, it means that yin is excessive externally while being deficient internally. A weak pulse coupled with body heat indicates that yang has been depleted internally and is relaxed externally. The depletion of the root energy of yin and yang indicates signs of death; it is not only winter and summer that lead to death, but spring and autumn can also sustain life. Furthermore, if the body is swollen from water retention, with tight skin and a strong pulse, if the hands and feet feel warm, it is called supportive and life-giving; if they feel cold, it is termed adversarial and leads to death. Warmth recovers the vital energy of the lesser yin, while the forces of fire and earth gradually strengthen, and the cold influences of water dissipate. Cold signifies that the vital energy of the lesser yin has been completely exhausted, thus resulting in death. As for a limp or lameness, it is an ailment caused by cold, wind, and dampness.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>[Note: &quot;Zhi bo&quot; refers to an inability to walk correctly and a neglect of the proper path. This condition is caused by wind, cold, and dampness, resulting in this illness.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Taiyin Yangming Treatise:</strong></p>
<p>The yin energy travels from the feet to the head and then travels down the arms to the fingertips; the yang energy travels from the hands to the head and then descends to the feet. Thus it is said: for yang illnesses, there is an ascent to the extreme and a descent; for yin illnesses, there is a descent to the extreme and an ascent. Therefore, those affected by wind will initially suffer from the upper body; those affected by dampness will initially suffer from the lower body. <strong>[Note: The term &quot;earth&quot; refers to the generation of all things and the laws of heaven and earth. The heavenly qi descends while the earthly qi ascends, thus affecting all four directions and everywhere in between. The spiritual essence, qi, and blood of the organs and the yin and yang of the twelve meridians are all generated from the earth. The yin concentrates on the yin, and the yang focuses on the yang, meaning that the pathogens follow the movement of qi. The entry and exit of a person’s yin and yang depend on the rise and fall of qi. This is why yang illnesses located above will, over time, follow the descent of qi; yin illnesses located below will, over time, follow the ascent of qi. For those who are first affected above, it indicates the pernicious qi is within a person of higher status, hence the pathogen is found above. For those who are first affected below, it indicates the clear and damp earthly qi is within a person who must begin with the feet, hence the clear qi is found below.]</strong> The Emperor asked: Why do the limbs become unusable in spleen diseases? Qi Bo answered: The limbs all receive qi from the stomach; if they do not reach the meridians, it must be due to the spleen, thus hindering their ability to receive it.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Now, when the spleen is unable to transform the fluids for the stomach, the limbs cannot receive the essence of water and air. As the qi daily weakens, the pulse becomes obstructed, and the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the qi necessary for growth, hence they cannot be utilized. </p>
<p>(Note: The stomach represents the yang aspect of the earth, while the spleen represents the yin aspect. The smooth flow to the limbs is due to the nurturing qualities of the earth. The limbs are the channels for the organs and the viscera. The limbs receive the air of water and grains through the transportation of the spleen. The spleen&#39;s transport varies according to the channels of the other organs, drawing qi from the Yangming channel; therefore, when the pulse is obstructed, the tendons, bones, and muscles cannot receive the qi for nourishment.)</p>
<p>The Yangming is the exterior, the sea of the five organs and six viscera, and it also circulates qi through the three yang channels. Each organ and viscera derives qi from its respective channels, allowing the stomach to transform its fluids. When the limbs fail to obtain the essence of food and water, they continue to weaken daily, the yin pathways become obstructed, and the tendons, bones, and muscles lack the qi for growth, hence they cannot be utilized.</p>
<p>(Note: The Yangming represents the exterior yang, serving as the sea for the five organs and six viscera, and it also circulates qi through the three yang channels, just as the sea moves clouds and moisture across the world. The three yin and three yang channels are responsible for receiving qi from the Taiyin and Yangming, respectively. The organs and limbs, which receive the essence of food and water, connect through their channels to the Taiyin and Yangming.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Yangming Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The limbs are the essence of all yang. When yang is abundant, the limbs are full; when they are full, one can ascend to great heights. </p>
<p><strong>Reverse Regulation Theory</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: Why do some people have hot limbs, feeling like they are scorched or on fire when exposed to wind and cold? Qi Bo replied: Such a person has deficient yin and abundant yang. The limbs represent yang. When both yangs interact and yin is scant, insufficient water cannot extinguish the abundant fire, and yang alone cannot nourish growth; it merely dominates and halts. When feeling scorched or on fire in the wind, it indicates the person’s flesh is about to melt.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Yang receives qi from the extremities, while Yin receives qi from the five viscera. The limbs are governed by Yangming. The two forms of Yang represent Yangming. When the two Yangs combine, it is thus called Yangming. When they support each other, they generate heat. When Yin qi is deficient, it indicates a lack of Shaoyin qi. When there is insufficient water, it means the body fluids are scarce. Since the body fluids are few and cannot be returned to the stomach, fire becomes intense and cannot be extinguished. The kidneys govern the storage of essence, which Yangming produces. The essence of the kidneys ascends and combines with Yangming, and when Wuxing and Guoqi unite, it transforms into fire. The upward flow of this fire qi, paired with deficient Yin qi, leads to predominance of Yang. However, alone, Yang cannot generate; it cannot further produce Yang heat, and thus it only triumphs. The qi of the two Yangs resides in the skin and muscles, and when confronted with the Yang pathogen of wind and heat, the evil meets the righteous, resulting in intense fire heat that consumes and scorches the muscles.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Malaria</strong></p>
<p>When an evil force strikes the head and neck, the vital energy reaches these areas and causes illness. If it strikes the back, energy reaches the back and causes illness. If it strikes the waist and spine, energy reaches those areas and causes illness. If it strikes the hands and feet, energy reaches those areas and causes illness. </p>
<p>[Note: When the evil force strikes the head and neck, the protective energy reaches the head and neck and causes illness. With strikes to the waist, back, hands, and feet, the evil force resides between these areas, and the protective energy reaches the waist and back, where it encounters the evil force and causes illness. The protective energy reaches the hands and feet, where it likewise encounters the evil force and causes illness.]</p>
<p>If there is only heat and no cold, the yin energy is depleted first, and the yang energy alone becomes active, leading to slight shortness of breath, irritability, hot hands and feet, and a desire to vomit; this condition is called &quot;dan malaria.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: If there is only heat and no cold, the evil energy collects in the bones and marrow, while the kidney&#39;s yin energy is first depleted from the bone energy. Thus, the external evil does not affect the internal yin, and only the yang becomes active. Heat injures the qi, hence the shortness of breath. The heart dislikes heat, resulting in irritability. The hands and feet are the foundations of all yang; therefore, they are hot. The classic states that all sour vomiting belongs to heat. This is the warm malaria that does not recur with cold, called &quot;dan malaria.&quot; &quot;Dan&quot; refers to singularity, indicating that it is primarily a disease of heat generated by excessive yang.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Qi and Shen</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes the shifting of cold and heat in the five organs and six bowels? Qi Bo replied: The stomach transfers heat to the gallbladder, which is also referred to as &quot;food.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The vital energy of the five organs and six bowels depends on the gallbladder. If the gallbladder&#39;s energy is dry and hot, yang does not ascend, resulting in weakness in the limbs. If the stomach&#39;s energy is hot, it digests food well, hence it is also called &quot;food.&quot;]</p>
<p>The large intestine transfers heat to the stomach, leading to good appetite but weight loss, which is also referred to as &quot;food.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: The stomach is responsible for receiving food and water, while the large intestine acts as a conduit. If the heat pathogen from the large intestine rebels and affects the stomach, the stomach becomes hot and digests food well. If there is dryness and heat in the yangming, then the nutrients and bodily fluids become deficient. Thus, one can eat but still become thin. &quot;Also&quot; signifies that although one can eat, the limbs remain weak, hence it is referred to as &quot;food.&quot;]<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>In late summer, if the earth is harmed by bad influences, it is called spleen wind. The symptoms of spleen wind include excessive sweating, aversion to wind, lethargy in the body, unwillingness to move the limbs, a pale yellow complexion, lack of appetite, and diagnosis often shows yellow in the nose. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The spleen governs the muscles and limbs, leading to lethargy and unwillingness to move, which indicates spleen qi illness. The foot Taiyin channel belongs to the spleen and connects to the stomach, traversing the diaphragm and linking the throat to the base of the tongue. The meridian section states: sickness produced by the spleen is characterized by inability to digest food. Located at the center, thus, diagnosis shows in the nose.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Discussion on Reversal</strong></p>
<p>If there is reversal in the great yang, the head swells and feels heavy, and the feet cannot walk, resulting in fainting. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Great yang corresponds to the sun. The foot Taiyang channel begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses the forehead to the crown, connects to the brain, and travels down the neck along the spine to the waist, passing through the buttocks and entering the popliteal fossa, moving along the inner knee and exiting behind the outer ankle. Therefore, if the reversal is above, it leads to head swelling and head pain; if it is below, it results in an inability to walk, and if there is clouding of the spirit and qi, it causes fainting. The sun governs all yang energies, and this illness affects the channels and then transforms into an issue of qi. </p>
<p>Reversal in the lesser yang results in sudden deafness, facial swelling and heat, pain in the side, and the inability to move the legs.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The channel of the foot Shaoyang originates from the outer canthus of the eye, enters the ear from behind, descends through the jaw, follows the sternum, passes through the hypochondrium, exits at the outer side of the knee, and travels along the foot&#39;s dorsum. Therefore, if the flow is reversed, it leads to sudden deafness, swelling of the cheeks, pain in the hypochondrium, and an inability to move the foot joints. </p>
<p>The condition of the foot Jueyin manifests as swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distension, ineffective urination, a preference for lying with knees bent, swelling of the genitals, and internal heat in the joints. </p>
<p>The channel of the foot Jueyin penetrates into the lower abdomen, connecting to the liver and gallbladder via the stomach. The liver governs the tendons and the knee is the convergence of the tendons. If the channels are reversed, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, hence the preference for lying down with knees bent.</p>
<p>When all three Yin channels are reversed, it prevents movement back and forth, resulting in cold hands and feet, leading to death within three days. </p>
<p>The reversal of all three Yin channels signifies a distinction between Yin and Yang. The inability to move back and forth indicates that Yin concerns the lower part. All Yang energy arises from Yin; thus, if the three Yin channels are reversed, the vital energy is completely extinguished, causing coldness in the limbs and resulting in death within three days. This condition affects the Qi level, hence it is said to lead to death in three days, indicating the cessation of Three Yin Qi. If the reversal occurs in the channels, it results in a condition characterized by Jue, but does not lead to death.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Great Treatise on Aberrations</strong></p>
<p>When the kidneys are obstructed, there is fullness below the abdomen, with variations in the size of the shins; the thighs become large and one may limp, easily leading to atrophy. [Note: &quot;Obstruction&quot; refers to the condition where the vital energy is full but externally obstructs the meridians. The kidney&#39;s pulse starts at the feet, circulates around the inner ankle, and is associated with the kidneys and bladder, hence the fullness below the abdomen. The kidneys govern the bones, and cold water governs the qi, which results in variations in size of the shins; the thighs become large and one may limp, easily leading to atrophy. This discussion pertains to the obstruction of vital energy in the meridians and the resulting condition, which differs from the situation where evil influences in the Sanjiao prevent urination, or from the presence of external evils impacting the physical body, which lead to atrophy for different reasons.]<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Chapter</strong></p>
<p>When a disease manifests as a limp due to deficiency, it results from the yang energy of the first month breaking through the frozen earth energy. The term &quot;deficiency&quot; refers to a significant lack during the cold of winter, which leads to the limp. [Note: This indicates that the yang energy arises from the cold water of winter, and when the cold water energy is insufficient, the yang energy is also deficient, resulting in a withered and limp foot.]</p>
<p>In the case of the lesser yang, when there are various difficulties, prolonged standing or sitting leads to a state where the eyes cannot see anything. The interplay of yin and yang becomes unstable, lacking a definitive control. As autumn begins to arrive with the first light frost, it begins to kill off all things. The internal struggle between yin and yang takes place, hence the inability of the eyes to see anything. [Note: &quot;Various difficulties&quot; refers to many things not being in harmony. This indicates that the lesser yang governs the periods of July and August, where, at the turn of July, the yin energy rises and the yang energy descends, causing instability between yin and yang elements, resulting in various difficulties and lack of clarity. As autumn arrives, the yang energy begins to descend, still weak internally, while the yin energy emerges, thus leading to an internal conflict between yin and yang, which causes the eyes to be unable to see anything.]<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Menstrual Regulation</strong></p>
<p>When the body has excess, it causes abdominal distension, ineffective urination and defecation; when it is deficient, the limbs are weak and unusable. [Note: The spleen governs the limbs, hence if it is deficient, they cannot function.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Variations of Qi</strong></p>
<p>In a year dominated by earth, excessive moisture leads to ailments; the kidneys are affected by pathogenic factors, resulting in abdominal pain, cold extremities, lack of joy, a heavy and burdensome body, and in severe cases, muscle atrophy and weakness in the feet. People experience pain in their feet, fullness from drinking, decreased appetite, and heavy limbs. [Note: In years with excessive earth, the earth dominates and constrains water, hence kidney issues and foot pain arise.]</p>
<p>In a year dominated by metal, excessive dryness causes ailments; the liver is affected by pathogenic factors, leading to severe symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, reversed qi, shoulder and back pain, as well as ailments affecting the buttocks, groin, knees, and feet. [Note: Excessive drying leads to the weakening of metal qi, allowing fire qi to rise. Wheezing and coughing indicate lung disease. Pain in the shoulders and back is due to lung issues located there, while ailments in the lower parts are due to weakened metal qi affecting the water organs.]</p>
<p>In a year with insufficient water, excessive dampness prevails; people experience abdominal fullness, a heavy body, diarrhea, and cold sores with discharges, as well as pain in the lower back and thighs, and difficulty in mobility. They suffer from restlessness, weakness in the feet, cold extremities, foot pain, and in severe cases, swelling in the legs.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>In the year of the six Gui, the water currents did not prevail, leading to dominance of the earth, hence the proliferation of humidity. Excessive damp soil harms the kidney yin, resulting in various illnesses.</p>
<p>When the fire of the year is insufficient, cold prevails, causing the people to suffer from internal pain in the arms, sudden cramps, and paralysis, leading to weakness in the legs.</p>
<p>When the earth is insufficient and the four directions are permeated with fine rain, in spring there are policies to announce the sound of bamboo drums; when the four directions vibrate and sway, in autumn there is a return to dried-up conditions. Illnesses are found in the four directions, within the spleen, and manifest as internal afflictions of the abdomen, while externally affecting the muscles and limbs.</p>
<p>The fine rain reflects the virtue of the earth&#39;s transformation. The sounds of bamboo announce regulations of wood. This balance of energies creates harmony with no dominating recovery. The vibration and swaying of wood overwhelms the earth. The harsh conditions of autumn represent the return of the metal element. The earth rules the four seasons, hence the reference to the four directions and the absence of timeliness. The heart is the division of the stomach, while the abdomen represents the bounds of the spleen.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>When the earth is overly abundant, it is called &quot;dun fu&quot; (rich and fortified). The significance of &quot;dun fu&quot; relates to broad transformation. It corresponds to the channels of the foot Taiyin (Spleen) and foot Yangming (Stomach), and its organs are the Spleen and Kidneys. Symptoms include abdominal fullness and inability to lift the limbs. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The abundance of earth energy spreads transformation throughout the four directions, which is why it is called broad transformation. It corresponds with the channels of the foot Taiyin and foot Yangming, and the organs of Spleen and Kidneys. Abdominal fullness and inability to lift the limbs are due to water and dampness causing illness.</li>

<p>In the Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) position, if guest qi prevails, it leads to腰 pain, ailments in the buttocks, thighs, knees, and feet, accompanied by dizziness due to heat with sourness, and swelling that prevents standing for long. Urination and defecation become abnormal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The guest qi of the four corresponds to the cold water of Taiyang (Greater Yang), which is why it affects the waist, buttocks, and thighs; all are related to the Yang channel&#39;s manifestations and mutual interactions of similar energies respectively. The subsequent qi corresponds to Jueyin (Absolute Yin) involving wind and wood. The dizziness with heat and sourness, along with swelling preventing prolonged standing, is a manifestation of the Spleen and earth, demonstrating that the excess of wood leads to the illness of earth. The final guest qi pertains to Shaoyin&#39;s fire, while the main qi relates to Taiyang&#39;s cold water. Changes in urination and defecation occur due to the intersection of water and fire, with fire dominating downward.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Taiyang position, if cold returns internally, it leads to pain in the waist and buttocks, with difficulty in bending and extending, along with discomfort in the thighs, shins, knees, and feet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The cold returning internally reflects the guest qi of Taiyang&#39;s cold water, which enters within, leading to an excess condition inside.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Pain in the waist, hips, thighs, and legs is a symptom of the Taiyang channel.

<p>When the year reaches the Yangming, dryness and excess prevail, causing the people to suffer from external heat in the feet. </p>
<p>(Note: Yangming pertains to the hour of Zi and Wu. The external heat in the feet is associated with Shaoyang ailments.) </p>
<p>The Shaoyin governs the heavens; when there is excess, symptoms include sneezing, a stiff neck, heat in the shoulders and back, headaches, slight breathing difficulties with fever, hearing loss, blurred vision, and in severe cases, swelling in the abdomen. </p>
<p>(Note: The Shaoyin governs the heavens, and the initial energy corresponds to the cold water of Taiyang; severe swelling indicates the triumph of this cold water energy.) </p>
<p>The Shaoyang also governs the heavens; with excess, symptoms include fullness in the chest, coughing with difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, blood, along with hot hands. </p>
<p>(Note: The Shaoyang governs the three energies of the initial phase, linked to the two fires of monarch and minister. Blood and hot hands indicate fire manifesting externally. The pulses of monarch and minister circulate in the hands, hence the warmth.)<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>A Discourse on Composure</strong></p>
<p>The Thunder Lord said: There are people who are lethargic in their limbs, have coughs with blood, and experience leakage. Foolishly diagnosing them, they believe it is a lung injury, feeling the pulse as floating, large, and tight, but they do not dare to treat. Coarse practitioners, when using stone needles, often lead to greater blood loss; when the blood stops, the body feels light. What is this? The Emperor said: What I can treat is numerous, yet this illness is lost to me. An analogy can be made to the swan flying, soaring into the sky. The sage in treating illness follows laws and keeps to measures, using connections and comparisons. In transformation, there is the dark and the bright, following both above and below—must one necessarily adhere to the classics? </p>
<p>Now, a floating, large, and weak pulse indicates an absolute deficiency of spleen qi, departing from the stomach and returning to the Yangming. The two fires cannot overcome the three waters, thus the pulse is chaotic and irregular. Lethargy in the limbs signifies a deficiency in the movement of spleen essence. Coughing with breathlessness indicates that water qi combines with Yangming. Blood leakage reflects that the pulse is rapid and the blood has nowhere to circulate. If one thinks it is a lung injury, it stems from an errant understanding. Not drawing analogies and comparisons indicates a lack of clarity. </p>
<p>[Note: This refers to the essence-water of the kidneys, which penetrates the earth and connects to the heavens. The phrase “there are people here” refers to these kidneys, where the individual suffers symptoms like lethargy in the limbs. The question of “what is this” asks how such an illness should be compared.]<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The sage treats illness by following the principles of yin and yang, drawing comparisons from nature and illustrating with metaphors, such as a swan flying, which ascends to the sky, similar to how the essence of the kidneys connects to the spleen and stomach, aligning with the lungs above. Therefore, the sage observes the profound workings of creation, following the flow between water and heaven; why should one solely adhere to the classics? The outward deficiency of spleen qi does not circulate through the muscles and skin. The path returning from the stomach to the Yangming meridian involves departing from the middle stomach to reach the external Yangming channel. The two fires refer to the governing fire interacting with the water. The three waters denote the moisture engendered by the Taiyin, ultimately manifesting as rainfall, which represents the moisture of the earth. Above the sun, the cold water dominates, representing the celestial cold water. The kidneys are the water organ, embodying the essence of heavenly water. When the three waters become too abundant, fire cannot overcome them, resulting in chaotic pulses and irregularities. The heart governs the blood and envelops the pulse, and when water converges within the pulse, the governing yang cannot prevail, causing disorder in the pulse and erratic blood flow. If the limbs are sluggish, it points to the essence of the spleen and earth not circulating through the muscles and skin. Those with coughs and wheezing have the water vapor of the lower jiao converging on the Yangming channel. For blood leakage, the water vapor mingles within the pulse, thus the pulse becomes rapid and lacks direction, leading to erratic blood flow and discharge. If one assumes there is injury to the lungs based on misguided reasoning, it indicates a failure to grasp the principles of comparison. Without drawing comparisons, one cannot attain clear understanding. The connection of kidney essence to the lungs must ascend from the central earth; if it instead travels through the pulse, then the governing fire is harmed.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Yin-Yang Classification</strong></p>
<p>Two Yins and one Yang cause illness in the kidneys, where Yin energy wanders under the heart, resulting in blocked and obstructed empty orifices, leading to the separation of the limbs. </p>
<p><em>Notes: This refers to water rising from the central earth to interact with the lungs, which then moves according to the weather in all directions. The two Yins refer to the two kidneys governed by the Lesser Yin, while the one Yang is the Lesser Yang generated by the kidney organs. The empty orifices denote the &quot;sweat cavities,&quot; overseen by the lungs; if water does not follow Qi to circulate on the surface of the skin, then the empty orifices become obstructed. The &quot;dam&quot; is what prevents water; if water does not penetrate into the soil&#39;s pathways, then the dam becomes blocked, causing the limbs to be unable to receive energy from the central earth. This is due to kidney disease and insufficient body fluids failing to nourish the spleen and lungs, leading to a deficiency of Qi that wanders under the heart following the Lesser Yang.</em></p>
<p>In the case of two Yins and two Yangs, illness affects the lungs; the pulse of the Lesser Yin is deep, overcoming lung weakness and affecting the limbs externally. </p>
<p><em>Notes: Here, the classifications of two Yins and two Yangs signify illness. The essence from the kidneys ascends to the lungs from the spleen, akin to a swan soaring into the sky. When the two Yins and two Yangs are similar but the illness affects the lungs, it signifies that kidney water directly ascends through the Yangming, thus causing the lung to become ill. The deep pulse of the Lesser Yin indicates that the heart and kidneys are not communicating. If water does not support fire, fire becomes hot and rises, overpowering the lungs; if water does not nourish the soil, the soil becomes dry, injuring the spleen&#39;s Qi, and external harm to the limbs occurs because the earth must receive water and moisture to irrigate in all directions.</em><a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatise on Subtle Principles</h3>
<p>Man&#39;s essence manifests as the yang energy above and the yin energy below. When yang gathers above, fire alone shines; when yin gathers below, it brings coldness, leading to stagnation. Thus, one water cannot withstand five fires, resulting in blindness.</p>
<h3>On Pathological Conditions of the Organs Caused by Evil Qi</h3>
<p>A rapid pulse in the kidney indicates bone epilepsy; a slightly rapid pulse suggests sinking lethargy, &quot;running pig&quot; (a sensation of panic or agitation), and inability to lift the legs, preventing movement forward or backward. </p>
<h3>On the Spirit</h3>
<p>If the spleen is troubled by worries and cannot resolve them, it harms the mind; when the mind is harmed, it leads to confusion, causing the limbs to be weak, the complexion to be poor, and leading to death in spring. </p>
<p>The spleen stores the essence, and essence harbors the mind; if spleen qi is deficient, the limbs become unresponsive, resulting in instability in the five organs.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Channel and Vessel Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The Stomach Foot Yangming channel governs diseases arising from blood, such as mania, intermittent fever, sweating, nasal bleeding, mouth crookedness, swollen lips, swollen neck, throat obstruction, abdominal edema, knee pain, and pain along the breast, ribs, groin, popliteal fossa, outer calf, and the top of the foot. The middle finger may be unusable. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Pingmai&quot; chapter states: Water enters the channels, and then blood is formed. The stomach is the sea of food and grain, which occupies the role of generating this nourishing blood. Thus, it governs blood-related illnesses, including mania and intermittent fevers. When sweating occurs, it is due to the heat of stomach qi evaporating the fluids into sweat. Nasal bleeding is due to hot channel qi. Signs like crooked mouth, swollen lips, swollen neck, throat obstruction, abdominal swelling, knee pain, and pain in the channels of the breast, groin, popliteal fossa, and top of the foot indicate diseases of the Yangming channel.</p>
<p>The Spleen Foot Taiyin channel governs diseases arising from the spleen, leading to inability to lie down, forcing oneself to stand, internal swelling of the thigh and knee, and inability to use the big toe.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Inability to lie down, forcing oneself to stand, swelling of the thigh and knee, and inability to use the big toe suggest an external illness related to the spleen.</p>
<p>The Bladder Foot Taiyang channel leads to a condition where movement causes pain in the hip, hindering bending, a tight feeling in the knee, or a tearing sensation; these represent contracted pain. It governs diseases arising from tendons, resulting in pain in the neck, back, waist, buttocks, knees, and feet, and the little toe may be unusable.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The qi of Taiyang originates from the water of the bladder, and it governs all Yang qi.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>Yang energy is soft and nurtures the tendons, hence it is responsible for diseases arising in the tendons, including ailments related to the lower back, waist, and knees, all of which are associated with the pathways of the meridians. The heart governs the hand&#39;s jueyin (pericardium) meridian, which is the source of diseases related to the arteries, manifesting as heart distress, heart pain, and heat in the palms. </p>
<p>The heart governs blood and commands the pericardium, thus it is responsible for diseases originating from the pericardium meridian, resulting in heart distress, heart pain, and heat in the palms—all linked to the pathways of the meridians. The Sanjiao (Triple Burner) corresponds to the hand&#39;s shaoyang (lesser yang) meridian, which is linked to diseases arising from qi, presenting as sweating, sharp eye pain, swelling, and pain in the back of the ears, shoulders, and elbows, and leading to dysfunction in the little and ring fingers. </p>
<p>The shaoyang is characterized as an early manifestation of yang energy, which leads to diseases related to qi; thus, the sweating occurs when yang is intensified in the presence of yin. Symptoms such as sharp eye pain, cheek swelling, pain in the back of the ears, shoulders, elbows, and dysfunction in the little and ring fingers all correlate to the pathways of the meridians. The gallbladder corresponds to the foot&#39;s shaoyang meridian, attributing to diseases arising from the bones, resulting in pain in the chest, ribs, hips, knees, and various joints, particularly affecting the little and ring fingers.</p>
<p>The shaoyang pertains to the kidneys and thus governs diseases of the bones, leading to pain in the hips, knees, and ankles, which are manifestations in the foot&#39;s shaoyang meridian. Since shaoyang governs the bones, this results in widespread joint pain.</p>
<p>The chapter on Meridian Tendons mentions that the foot&#39;s taiyang (greater yang) tendon manifests disease as swelling and pain in the little toe and heel.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The muscles of the Lesser Yang of the foot, when ill, result in cramps in the little and next toes, with the knee unable to bend or stretch, tightness in the hamstrings, pulling forward at the hip, and backward at the buttocks. If the left angle is injured, the right foot becomes unusable; this condition is called &quot;the intermingling of the tendons.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;The intermingling of the tendons&quot; refers to the Yang Wei muscle. The Yang energy circulates from the left to the right tendon, thus the intermingling of left and right. The left connects to the right; therefore, injury to the left angle means the illness travels from left to right. The right foot being unusable occurs from above to below.)</p>
<p>The muscles of the Greater Yang of the foot are affected when there are cramps in the middle toe and the shank, the foot feels stiff while jumping, and there is tension in the Achilles tendon, with swelling in the front of the hip.</p>
<p>(Note: The Greater Yang muscle begins at the middle three toes, aligns with the area outside of the foot, and ascends along the hip and thigh to the neck, connecting between the mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. The illness manifests as cramps in the shank and tension in the Achilles tendon, leading to stiffness in the feet, which indicates an issue with the tendons.)</p>
<p>The muscles of the Greater Yin of the foot, when affected, result in pain in the big toe and inner ankle, cramps causing pain, inner knee ligament pain, and pulling pain in the inner thigh.</p>
<p>(Note: The Greater Yin muscle begins at the inner side of the big toe and follows the knee and thigh up to the chest and abdomen; internally, it adheres to the spine, and the illness manifests as pain in the affected areas.)</p>
<p>The muscles of the Lesser Yin of the foot have illnesses characterized by cramps below the foot, and pain in all areas crossed or connected by the muscles.</p>
<p>(Note: The illness manifests as cramps below the foot, with pain in areas crossed or bound, indicating conditions such as spasms and rigidity, which are also issues with the tendons.)<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The sinews of the Foot Jueyin: when affected, there is pain in the area before the inner ankle of the big toe, pain in the inner thigh, cramping, and inability to use the genitals. </p>
<p>Note: The sinews of the Foot Jueyin begin at the great swell of the big toe, tracing up the leg and connecting to the genitals, intertwining with various sinews. The genitals hold the convergence of the sinews; as the Jueyin governs the sinews, it connects with the sinews of the Three Yin and Three Yang. Therefore, its path leads to pain, cramping, and the dysfunction of the genitals.</p>
<p>The sinews of the Hand Taiyang: when affected, there is pain behind the bony ridge of the inner elbow associated with the little finger. </p>
<p>Note: The areas traversed by this sinew can lead to swelling and weakness of the muscles.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The muscle of the Hand Shaoyang originates at the tip of the little finger and the ring finger, terminates at the wrist, travels up the arm to the elbow, loops around the outer part of the forearm, ascends to the shoulder, and runs towards the neck, connecting with the Hand Taiyang.

<p>The muscle of the Hand Taiyin starts from the top of the thumb, moves along the finger upward, connects at the back of the wrist, runs along the outer side of the wrist, ascends the arm, connects at the middle of the elbow, travels along the inner part of the forearm, and enters the armpit. Its ailments correspond to the areas it passes through, resulting in painful muscle cramps.</p>

<h3>Discussions on the Sea of Marrow</h3>
<p>When the Sea of Marrow is abundant, one possesses lightness, strength, and excessive potency. When the Sea of Marrow is insufficient, there are symptoms like dizziness, tinnitus, a sourness in the shins, blurred vision, and a tendency to lethargy and languor. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Seminal fluid nourishes the brain marrow and, flowing downwards to the lower regions, thus when the Sea of Marrow is abundant, the vitality is invigorated and one has much strength. &quot;Degree&quot; refers to the bone&#39;s capacity. The marrow originates from the bone cavities and travels up through the bone&#39;s structure to connect with the brain; thus, when it is abundant, it surpasses its normal limits. When the Sea of Marrow is insufficient, the bodily fluids are depleted; these fluids also moisten the orifices, which is why one experiences tinnitus and blurred vision. When the fluids are exhausted, the bones are unable to flex and extend properly, leading to sourness in the shins and a tendency to lethargy and slothfulness.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p>
<h3>On Reversal and Order of Fat and Thin</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: How do the pulses run in reverse and order? Qi Bo replied: The three Yin of the hands run from the organs to the hands; the three Yang of the hands run from the hands to the head; the three Yang of the feet run from the head to the feet; the three Yin of the feet run from the feet to the abdomen. 【Note: This refers to the pulses of the hands and feet, both Yin and Yang, moving internally and externally in reverse and order, corresponding to the channels of earth and water.】</p>
<h3>On the Relations of Yin and Yang to the Sun and Moon</h3>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that heaven is Yang, earth is Yin, the sun is Yang, and the moon is Yin; how do these correlate in humans? Qi Bo replied: Above the waist is heaven, below the waist is earth; hence heaven is Yang and earth is Yin. Therefore, the twelve channels of the feet correspond to the twelve months. The moon arises from water, thus those below are Yin. The ten fingers of the hands correspond to the ten days, with the sun as the master of fire; thus those above are Yang. 【Note: Accumulated Yang constitutes heaven, accumulated Yin constitutes earth, and the union of heaven and earth results in human life. Accordingly, the upper half of the body is governed by heavenly energy, while the lower half is governed by earthly energy. The sun corresponds to fire, the moon to water; humans possess the primal water and fire, forming this shape, hence those above are Yang corresponding to the sun, and those below are Yin corresponding to the moon.】<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>The ten days correspond to the ten celestial stems, while the twelve months correspond to the twelve earthly branches. Thus, there are twelve primary meridians in the feet to correspond with the twelve months, and ten fingers in the hands to correspond with the ten days. Humans are born from the interaction of heaven, earth, water, and fire, hence they are connected to heaven and earth. The Yellow Emperor asked: How shall we connect this to the meridians? Qi Bo replied: The Yin of the tiger corresponds to the birth of Yang in the first month, governing the lesser Yang of the left foot. The horse corresponds to the sixth month, governing the lesser Yang of the right foot. The rabbit corresponds to the second month, governing the greater Yang of the left foot. The horse corresponds to the fifth month, governing the greater Yang of the right foot. The dragon corresponds to the third month, governing the brightness of Yang on the left foot. The snake corresponds to the fourth month, governing the brightness of Yang on the right foot. These two Yangs combine in the front, hence it is called brightness of Yang. The monkey corresponds to the seventh month, governing the lesser Yin of the right foot. The ox corresponds to the twelfth month, governing the lesser Yin of the left foot. The rooster corresponds to the eighth month, governing the greater Yin of the right foot. The rat corresponds to the eleventh month, governing the greater Yin of the left foot. The dog corresponds to the ninth month, governing the closed Yin of the right foot.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The month of Hai is October, which governs the left foot of the Jueyin. As these two Yin energies intersect completely, it is thus called Jueyin. </p>
<p>(Note: Ages above half a year are considered Yang, presiding over Shaoyang and Taiyang; ages below half a year are considered Yin, presiding over Shaoyin and Taiyin, resembling the division of the two principles into the four images. The two Yang energies unite and are thus called Yangming. The two Yin energies intersect completely, hence it is called Jueyin. These four images give rise to three Yin and three Yang in Tai, Shao, and Zhong. Males are born in Yin (Tiger), thus beginning with the Shaoyang of the first month; females are born in Shen (Monkey), thus beginning with the Shaoyin of the seventh month. Yang flows from the left, hence left to right; Yin flows from the right, hence right to left.)</p>
<p>Jia governs the left hand of Shaoyang, Ji governs the right hand of Shaoyang, Yi governs the left hand of Taiyang, Wu governs the right hand of Taiyang, Bing governs the left hand of Yangming, and Ding governs the right hand of Yangming. Since these two fires unite, this is termed Yangming.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>The Geng governs the right hand&#39;s Shaoyin, while the Gui governs the left hand&#39;s Shaoyin. The Xin rules the right hand&#39;s Taiyin, and the Ren oversees the left hand&#39;s Taiyin. </p>
<p>[Note: The Yangming corresponds to the sun, and the Shaoyang to fire; thus the convergence of the two fires constitutes Yangming. Yangming symbolizes clarity and brightness. The concept of two fires converging represents brightness. The combination of two Yangs creates clarity, defining Yangming. The Shaoyin of the hand corresponds to the fire governing the sun, while the Taiyin of the hand pertains to the metal of the lung governing the sky; thus, in the ten fingers, there exists Yin within Yang.]</p>
<p>Therefore, the Yang of the feet represents the Shaoyang within Yin; the Yin of the feet represents the Taiyin within Yin. The Yang of the hands signifies the Taiyang within Yang; the Yin of the hands denotes the Shaoyin within Yang. Above the waist is considered Yang, while below the waist is considered Yin. </p>
<p>[Note: The differentiation of above the waist as Yang and below the waist as Yin represents the positioning of Yin and Yang. The hand channels possess Yin, while the foot channels embody Yang, illustrating the interplay of energies between the upper and lower parts of the body.]<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>On the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The liver corresponds to the nails. If the nails are thick and yellow, the gallbladder is thick; if the nails are thin and red, the gallbladder is thin; if the nails are hard and blue, the gallbladder is urgent; if the nails are moist and red, the gallbladder is relaxed; if the nails are straight and white without constraints, the gallbladder is direct; if the nails are dark and mottled, the gallbladder is congested.<br>[Note: Zhu states that the nails are an extension of the tendons, hence the liver corresponds to the nails. By observing the condition of the nails, one can understand the thickness, thinness, relaxation, and urgency of the gallbladder.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Five Colors</strong></p>
<p>The zygomatic bone corresponds to the shoulders. The area behind the zygomatic corresponds to the arms. Below the arms corresponds to the hands. The inner canthi of the eyes correspond to the breast and nipples. The area alongside and above corresponds to the back. The region beneath the zygomatic corresponds to the thighs. The center corresponds to the knees. Below the knees corresponds to the shins. Below the shins corresponds to the feet. The major articulation corresponds to the inner thighs. The major bend corresponds to the kneecap. These are the parts of the five organs and six viscera, as well as the limbs, each having its respective sections. Each section interacts with the yin and yang; the yin and yang interact with each section. Understanding the sections is crucial, as it informs countless actions. The ability to distinguish left from right is called the Great Way. Men and women occupy different positions, hence the concept of yin and yang.</p>
<p><strong>On the Abnormality of Defensive Qi</strong></p>
<p>The skin has areas, and the areas of the skin extend to the four extremities.<br>[Note: Defensive qi flows through the skin and extends to the four extremities, corresponding to the areas it governs. Defensive qi emerges from yang, flowing from the head and descending to the five fingers of the hands and feet, hence the four extremities are considered the area.] </p>
<p><strong>On Movement and Transmission</strong><a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;The functions of nourishment and defense interconnect above and below, like a ring without ends. Now, when one suddenly encounters evil qi and faces severe cold, if the hands and feet are sluggish, the pathways of yin and yang can lose their connection, and how can the qi return?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The meeting of yin and yang at the four extremities is the great network of qi. The four channels are the routes of qi. Hence, when the network is interrupted, the routes are clear; when the four extremities are relaxed, the qi unites and circulates like a ring.&quot; The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Good. This is what is meant by a ring without ends, with no one knowing its origins.&quot;</p>
<p>In the chapter on the twenty-five persons of yin and yang:</p>
<p>Below the foot of the lesser yang, when blood and qi are abundant, the outer ankle is plump; when blood is plentiful and qi is scarce, the skin of the outer ankle is tough and thick; when blood is scanty and qi is abundant, the skin of the outer ankle is thin and soft; when both blood and qi are insufficient, the outer ankle is lean with no flesh. </p>
<p>[Note: The lesser yang meridian descends, following the outer side of the knee and passing in front of the tibia, reaching the tip of the fibula, and descending out in front of the outer ankle, following the foot&#39;s dorsal surface. Thus, in conditions where blood and qi are abundant, the outer ankle appears plump; if blood is plentiful, the skin is tough and thick; if blood is scarce, the skin is thin and soft.]</p>
<p>Below the foot of the greater yang, when blood and qi are abundant, the heel is full and strong; when qi is scarce and blood is plentiful, the heel is hollow; when both blood and qi are deficient, one experiences muscle cramps and pain under the heel.</p>
<p>[Note: Muscle cramps and heel pain occur when blood and qi are deficient and are unable to nourish the tendons and bones.]</p>
<p>Below the hand of the yang brightness, when blood and qi are abundant, the hand feels warm and meaty; when both qi and blood are scarce, the hand appears thin and cold.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The pathways of the hand Yangming descend along the upper arm, entering between the two muscles and exiting at Hegu (LI4). Therefore, when the blood and qi are abundant, the hands are fleshy and warm; when they are deficient, the hands become thin and cold. In the hand Shaoyang, when blood and qi are abundant, the hands are fleshy and warm; when they are deficient, they become cold and thin. If qi is scarce and blood is plentiful, the hands will be thin despite having many veins visible.</p>
<p>Regarding the pathways of the hand Taiyang, when blood and qi are abundant, the palm is plump; when they are deficient, the palm is thin and cold. The pathway of the hand Taiyang descends along the shoulder and elbow, exiting at the wrist, which explains why, when blood and qi are abundant, the palm is full, and when they are deficient, the palm is thin and cold.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>The Beginning of All Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When the external evil enters a person, it starts in the skin. If it remains and does not disperse, it settles in the channels and vessels; if it does not leave, it lodges in the meridians; if it continues to remain, it stays in the collaterals. During the time it resides in the collaterals, the six channels do not flow smoothly, leading to pain in the joints of the limbs and stiffness in the waist and spine. </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;The collaterals&quot; refers to the channels that transport blood and vital energy, specifically the pathways related to the organs. The main networks of the organs connect and exit through various channels, spreading to the extremities. Therefore, if the evil lingers in the collaterals, the six channels become obstructed, resulting in joint pain in the limbs. The stiffness in the waist and spine arises because the major networks of the organs are connected to the Governing Vessel.)<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p>
<h3>Evil Guest Poem</h3>
<p>The heavens are round and the earth is square; the human head is round and the feet are square to correspond. The heavens have four seasons, and humans have four limbs; the heavens have ten suns, and humans have ten fingers. The zodiac has twelve signs, and humans have ten fingers and toes hanging down to correspond. Women have only two segments to embrace the human form.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Disease Diagnosis by Measuring</h3>
<p>When the elbow is warm, the heat is above the waist; when the hand is warm, the heat is below the waist; when the front of the elbow is warm, the heat is in the front of the chest; when the back of the elbow is warm, the heat is in the shoulders and back; when the center of the arm is warm, the heat is in the waist and abdomen; if three to four inches below the back of the elbow is warm, there are parasites in the intestine; if the palm is warm, there is heat in the abdomen; if the palm is cold, there is cold in the abdomen; if there are blue blood vessels on the white flesh of the fish, there is cold in the stomach. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The path of the hand Tai Yin meridian starts from the lesser merchant at the tip of the finger, goes past the Shu point, travels through the channel, and enters the cubit at the point of the Lesser Marsh. The external Qi and blood of the pulse come from the hand Yang Ming&#39;s five miles, moving above the cubit of the fish, flowing in reverse and order. The pulse of the elbow starts at the inch and goes down to the cubit. The hand starts at the cubit and goes up to the inch. The warm sensation in front of the elbow indicates heat above the waist; the warm sensation in the hand indicates heat below the waist. This measures the skin and assesses the shape of the body above and below, hence the diagnosis is inverted compared to the pulse evaluation. The front of the elbow is where the hand Jue Yin&#39;s curve marsh is located, and the back of the elbow is where the hand Shao Yang&#39;s celestial well is located.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The hands hang down, one above to receive from above and one below to receive from below, on the front to receive from the front, and on the back to receive from the back. The so-called area of the elbows and hands refers to the back of the arms; the part above the palm signifies the front of the arms. The back is associated with Yang, hence it receives external shapes; the front governs Yin, thus it receives the internal organs such as the waist and abdomen. The area outside the measurement corresponds to the seasonal side, while within the measurement corresponds to the abdomen; the fundamental principles are the same.</p>
<p>Regarding stool that is reddish and loose, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, it is difficult to resolve. If the pulse is weak but the hands and feet are warm, it is easy to resolve.</p>
<p>Note: The term &#39;reddish and loose stool&#39; refers to a distinction between yellow and red. In the middle burner, the turbid residue is transformed into fluids, leading to the formation of blood, which travels through the channels and is called the nourishing Qi. Food and drink regularly coexist in the stomach, forming turbid residue, which passes down into the large intestine, aiding in the separation of essences that seep into the bladder. If the stool is reddish and loose, it indicates that blood and turbid residue from the middle burner are moving downward together. Loose stools indicate a deficiency in the large intestine, causing it to be unable to properly separate the essences. This causes a deficiency in both the intestines and stomach; the fluids from the middle burner cannot nourish the pulse, thus resulting in a weak pulse. Conversely, when the hands and feet are warm, it indicates the receipt of vital energy from the lower burner, hence the ease of resolution.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Yongju Commentary</strong></p>
<p>When a sore occurs on the thigh or leg, it is called &quot;thigh and leg sore.&quot; Its appearance does not change much, but the pus affects the bone. If not treated urgently, death will occur within thirty days. </p>
<p><em>Note: The occurrence on the thigh and leg is due to the toxicity of the lesser yin of the foot. The appearance does not change significantly because the toxin adheres to the bone and does not manifest outwardly, hence the skin does not change much, which is characteristic of this toxic sore.</em></p>
<p>When it occurs in the inner thigh, it is called &quot;red application.&quot; If not treated urgently, death will occur within sixty days. If it is inside the two thighs, without treatment, death will occur in ten days. </p>
<p><em>Note: The inner thigh is part of the three yin of the foot; due to fire toxicity applied to the genital area, it is named &quot;red application.&quot; The number six represents the essence of water, while ten days signifies the end of the yin cycle.</em></p>
<p>When it occurs at the knee, it is called &quot;blemished sore,&quot; its condition large and unchanging, cold and hot, like a hard stone. Do not treat it as a stone, for doing so will lead to death; it must be handled gently to allow recovery.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The knee is where the tendons converge and is an area of the lesser yang. If the color does not change, it means the color is the same as the skin and is not red. If it resembles a large sore but the color does not change, it indicates that the poison is situated between the exterior and interior. The lesser yang governs joints; hence its color and condition signify cold and heat. If it feels like a hard stone, do not use a stone to press on it; doing so will cause death as the poison will enter the interior. It must be soft, and when pressed, it will help the poison escape from the exterior. The lesser yang governs the joints, therefore it can operate both internally and externally.</p>
<p>When the hair appears on the shin, it is called &quot;rabbit gnaw.&quot; If its condition is red down to the bone, it requires urgent treatment; if untreated, it will harm the person. &quot;Rabbit&quot; refers to the yin aspect. The emergence on the shin, referred to as &quot;rabbit gnaw,&quot; indicates a condition on the yin side of the shin. The redness extending to the bone signifies an inward progression, thus urgent treatment is necessary. Untreated, it harms the person, akin to an external thief causing harm.</p>
<p>If it appears on the inner ankle, it is called &quot;slow journey,&quot; resembling an abscess, with no change in color. It requires a few applications, after which the cold and heat will be stopped, and it will not be fatal.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The transformation of carbuncles and sores has two types: one has an internal cause with toxins spreading outward, while the other has swelling visible externally with toxic energy moving inward. When the evil remains in the pulse and does not move, it is called &quot;slow-moving,&quot; resembling a carbuncle but without a red color. The foot&#39;s lesser yin meridian starts from beneath the little toe, with the evil moving to the sole, emerging under the arch and following behind the inner ankle, rising within. Therefore, one should alleviate the evil and stop the cold and heat by using stones. The lesser yin of the foot embodies the primordial water and fire, which allows it to manifest cold and heat.</p>
<p>When it arises from above and below the foot, it is called the &quot;Four Evils.&quot; Its appearance resembles a large carbuncle; if not urgently treated, it can lead to death within a hundred days. The &quot;Four Evils&quot; refers to the evil energy that dwells excessively in the left and right sides. The lesser yang governs the energy of early yang, pertaining to the kidneys, where the sun is the repository of the kidneys and governs all yang energies. Hence, urgent treatment is necessary; otherwise, the yang energy will be harmed, leading to death within a hundred days.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>When a sore appears beside the foot, it is called a &quot;Li Ying.&quot; Its initial size is small, resembling the thickness of a little finger. It should be treated quickly; if the blackness is removed, it will not worsen. If left untreated, death may occur within a hundred days. </p>
<p>Note: The yangming channel of the foot originates from the point next to the big toe, hence the sore appears beside the foot and is named &quot;Li Ying.&quot; The blackness refers to the color of water; if it is not promptly treated to remove the blackness, coldness will dominate and the earth element will fail.</p>
<p>When a sore arises on the toe, it is called a &quot;Tuo Ying.&quot; Its appearance is red-black, and if left untreated, it leads to death. If it is not red-black, it will not cause death. If it is not diminishing, it must be urgently excised; otherwise, it will result in death.</p>
<p>Note: This &quot;Tuo Ying,&quot; attributed to the lesser yin poison, manifests from within to the outside, hence called &quot;Tuo Ying,&quot; referring to a departure from yin to yang. The sore on the toe refers to the big toe of the foot. The lesser yin harbors the primordial water and fire; a red-black appearance indicates that the toxicity of water and fire is excessively potent, leading to an untreatable death. If it is not red-black, the toxic qi has diminished, thus not leading to death. If the sore does not recede, urgent amputation of the toe is necessary; otherwise, the toxic qi will penetrate the various channels and result in death.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficulties in Diagnosis</strong></p>

<p>If the spleen pulse is obtained, its external symptom is a yellow face with tendency to burp, think deeply, and enjoy food. Internally, there is movement sensation at the navel, which feels firm and painful upon pressure. The condition presents with abdominal fullness, poor digestion, heavy body, joint pain, lethargy, and a desire to lie down, with limbs not retracting. If these symptoms are present, it indicates a spleen issue; if not, it indicates otherwise.

<p>The distinction between foot qi and qi foot lies in the fact that foot qi is characterized by the invasion of internal evil toxins into the feet, while qi foot is caused by external influences such as wind, cold, heat, and humidity that penetrate the feet and knees and gradually affect the internal organs. Both conditions result in the body being deprived of balance, leading to similar ailments. </p>
<p>In treatment, there is a hierarchy; consequently, one must discern the underlying causes rather than ignoring them, as this can lead to ineffective healing. Additionally, the emotions of joy, anger, worry, and cool or hot conditions can affect the limbs, particularly the feet and knees, presenting symptoms akin to wind-related joint ailments. However, when the issue originates externally, it is termed foot qi, whereas when it comes from within, it is referred to as qi foot.</p>
<p>For foot qi, one should first treat the internal problems before addressing the external, through nourishing the strong and supporting the weak. The prevalence of foot qi can be attributed to the heart and lung meridians originating in the hands, while the spleen, kidney, and liver meridians emerge from the feet. The hands clear internal evils, while the feet bear the burden of external toxins, making them most affected by wind, cold, heat, and humidity.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from this condition often do so gradually, starting with subtle signs that go unnoticed. Those who become aware may misunderstand, while practitioners may attribute the symptoms to other ailments, leading to unclear treatment and worsening conditions. What begins as a minor issue can escalate into a severe state, affecting the internal organs and resulting in pain across various body parts without the individual even realizing it.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>At times, one may suffer due to various causes, such as from cold infections or heat strokes, abdominal and back pains, numbness in limbs and joints, confusion in speech, mental fog, shortness of breath, sudden blindness or deafness, inability to eat or digest, dysfunction of internal organs, urgency that cannot be relieved, discomfort that cannot be eased, twitching of mouth and eyes, trembling of hands and feet—so many various manifestations, and none can find a cure. Thus, the ignorant and ordinary people are left helpless in sickness, dying without recourse to treatment. Would not a benevolent person feel sorrow upon witnessing this? Now I begin to outline the essentials, briefly indicating the depth and understanding for future learners. </p>
<p>As for becoming intoxicated and entering a room, indulgently sleeping under the dew, seeking coolness against the wind, reveling under the moon, bathing yet not drying before falling into deep slumber, soon afterward confronting the cold air, standing for a long time in dampness, lingering by waters, walking in the rain, sleeping in cold, over-exerting and sweating, dining with grief, violating prohibitions, all lead to illness. Regarding improper energies, if they affect the head, they harm the mind; if they affect the heart, they damage the abdomen; if they affect the lower body, they impair the waist and feet; if they affect the sides, they obstruct the limbs and joints—countless forms and proofs, all belong to the influence of these energies.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The condition begins at the knees and is referred to as &quot;foot qi.&quot; The examination of the pulse and the body&#39;s state should be thorough. A floating and taut pulse arises from wind, a moist and weak pulse from dampness, a surging and rapid pulse from heat, a slow and thick pulse from cold, a slippery and faint pulse from deficiency, and a firm and solid pulse from excess. If it is in the upper part of the body, it manifests upwards; if in the lower part, it manifests downwards; if in the middle, it manifests centrally. Stagnation is due to qi, dispersal due to worry, tightness due to anger, and thinness due to grief. Wind leads to sweating and recovery, dampness to warmth and recovery, heat to resolution and recovery, and cold to smoothing and recovery. Deficiency should be supplemented, excess should be drained, qi should flow, worry should be eased, anger should be transformed, and grief should be harmonized. A healer who understands these principles is called a good doctor. Foot qi disease is transmitted to the heart and liver, with a mortality rate near 100% if untreated. When it enters the heart, it causes confusion, delusions, vomiting, inability to eat, and restless sleep. The pulse at the left wrist may alternate between large and small, appearing and disappearing. When it enters the kidneys, both the waist and feet swell, urination becomes obstructed, moaning is incessant, and the eyes and forehead turn dark. At times, it affects the chest and abdomen, causing difficulty in breathing, and the pulse at the left wrist may be absent. This should be examined carefully.</p>
<pre><code>      Death indicators:

<p>If the fingers and toes have blackened nails and flesh, it indicates death.<br>If the bones cause pain in the waist and spine, and there is heaviness in the kidneys preventing turning, with the back of the knees flat, death occurs in five days.<br>If the kidneys are compromised and the feet swell, death occurs in nine days.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If the tendons are severed and the soul is alarmed, causing terror in the void, with the hands and feet turning blue and the person persistently shouting and cursing, they will die in eight or nine days.</p>

<p>Signs of death: If the feet, toes, heels, and knees feel like they are in a fight, one must know that preservation is difficult in ten days. If the hands and feet turn blue and there is much shouting and cursing, it is certain that if the tendons are severed, one will hardly survive nine days.</p>
<p>Discussion on wind poison symptoms: Reviewing various classic texts, there are often discussions about weakness in the feet, yet this ailment was rare in ancient times. Since the Yongjia period when many scholars migrated south, numerous cases have appeared. In Jiangdong, there are practitioners who focus on classic methods and excel in these treatments, achieving great success due to the teachings of these two figures. Furthermore, between the Song and Qi dynasties, there were deep masters of Buddhist teachings who recorded their methods in old texts, compiling nearly a hundred treatments for foot weakness. In the Zhou and Wei dynasties, this disease seemingly did not exist; thus, Master Yao&#39;s compilations did not receive much attention, and Xu Wang&#39;s records were not taken seriously. Hence, even when there were three methods practiced, the teachings were not uniform, and not caring for frost and dew, as well as temperature variations, led to a lack of understanding of the disease in regions such as Shanxi and Hebei.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Since the glorious Tang dynasty was established, the world has been unified, with the southernmost regions being heavily fortified. Those who do not adapt to the local environment have invariably faced troubles. Recently, even among Chinese scholars and officials who do not traverse the rivers and seas, there are those who suffer from this issue. This is largely due to the current state of affairs, where the prevailing attitudes are confused, and all things seem to be equalized. However, this affliction begins at the feet: it manifests as swelling in the legs, and is commonly referred to as “gout” by contemporaries. According to historical masters, the weak-footed are meant in this context. These masters have described various remedies for weak feet, including over eighty potent formulas, such as those using lotus leaves and yellow essence from Mount Yongping, which are all quite essential. Yet, for those studying these remedies, they often seem cumbersome, as it is essentially a compilation of prescriptions. In times of urgent need, one cannot rely on detailed guidance. Therefore, I will now select the most effective remedies that I have come across for urgent use, without elaborating further on the others.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>On How It Affects the Feet</strong></p>
<p>The question is asked: When people are affected by wind toxins, they can fall ill anywhere; why is it particularly focused on the feet? The answer is: Humans have five organs, with the heart and lungs connected to the hands and fingers, while the liver, kidneys, and spleen are associated with the feet and toes. The energy of wind toxins arises from the ground, and the cold, heat, wind, and humidity of the earth create vapor. Since the feet are always in contact with the ground, those afflicted by wind toxins will first be affected at their feet. If the illness does not heal over time, it may then spread to the limbs, abdomen, back, head, and neck. At first, one may not be aware of it, but over time, the chronic nature of the illness becomes evident. The classics say this is a transmission of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>On Recognizing Its Manifestation</strong></p>
<p>All cases of foot ailments are caused by exposure to wind toxins. Most people do not recognize this illness immediately; it may only manifest after the onset of another sickness, or one may suddenly feel lethargic, remaining inactive for two to three days before noticing it. Many lesser-skilled doctors do not understand this condition and mistakenly treat the symptoms as other diseases, often leading to fatal outcomes. Therefore, this illness frequently goes unrecognized. It begins very subtly, and one may feel normal in terms of food intake, hydration, and play, but suddenly experiences weakness in the feet, unable to move. This is the distinct sign. The Yellow Emperor states: It is a lingering issue of wind and dampness causing obstruction.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>On the Manifestations of Wind Toxins</strong></p>
<p>In cases of foot ailments, one may not feel any unusual symptoms in the feet, yet discomfort can be present in the head, neck, and arms. Additionally, there may be difficulties in various parts, yet the heart and internal organs suffer from distress. There are those afflicted by wind toxins who might experience symptoms such as vomiting upon seeing food, aversion to food odors, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. Some may feel a palpitating sensation in the chest and desire to avoid bright light, or experience a foggy mind and forgetfulness, with speech becoming disordered. Others may have fevers and headaches, or feel extreme cold and pain throughout the body, or experience muscle cramps, swelling of the legs, or stubbornness in limb movements. Sometimes, they may face spasms in the joints or numbness in the lower abdomen. All these are manifestations of foot ailments and are also referred to as symptoms of wind toxins. </p>
<p>The signs can be difficult to discern, requiring careful observation; otherwise, one may miss crucial indicators. Once the illness develops, treatment can be challenging, particularly for women. Furthermore, there are women who, after childbirth, often suffer due to exposure to cool conditions in spring and summer, which can lead to these toxins, so caution is advised. Symptoms include heat, discomfort, palpitations, irritability, and nausea—all indicators of this condition. Additionally, if one feels a cold sensation in the lower abdomen and experiences discomfort with urination that is different from their usual state, this is also a sign of foot ailments. Pain and weakness are associated with dampness and obstruction.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>On the Causes of Disease</strong></p>
<p>In all four seasons, one should not sit or stand for long in damp and cold places. Also, one must not, when drunk and sweating, remove clothing, shoes, or socks to cool off in the wind, as this can lead to foot ailments. If, during the hot months, one sits or stands for too long in damp places, the heat and humidity can penetrate the meridians, causing pain and discomfort in the limbs. Conversely, if one sits or stands in damp and cold places during the cold months, the cold and dampness may enter the meridians, leading to intense coldness and cramps throughout the body. If one cools off in the wind after being overheated, the resulting illness can lead to stubborn pain and twitching in the flesh, gradually moving towards the head. </p>
<p>On ordinary days, when there is suddenly extreme heat that is unbearable, one must not immediately seek relief in the cold. If a severe cold follows, one cannot endure it, and such conditions will lead to illness. There are diligent scholars focused on their studies, who sit or stand for long periods in damp places, unable to move, and when a cold wind strikes, it invades the meridians, unbeknownst to them, resulting in sickness. Thus, people afflicted by wind toxins may first experience symptoms in their fingers and toes, as excessive sweating opens the pores and allows the wind to enter swiftly. Symptoms may also first appear in the soles of the feet, or in the arches, or in the lower legs, inside and out.</p>
<p>To prevent illness, at the first signs of discomfort, one should apply moxibustion to the affected area with three to twenty strong treatments, and thus recover, preventing recurrence. The Yellow Emperor states: cooling off in the wind, or drunkenness followed by retreat indoors can lead to such diseases.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>On the Differences of Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>It is asked: Why do those who are afflicted experience both cold and heat? The answer is: The body has three yin and three yang. Among the cold are three yang, where the problem must be cold; among the heat are three yin, where the problem must be heat. Therefore, the manifestations of cold and heat differ internally and externally. Heat is treated with cold remedies, and cold is treated with heat remedies, according to one’s intentions. When the spleen suffers from yang poison, it manifests as stubborn heat; when the kidneys suffer from yin dampness, it manifests as cold stagnation.</p>
<p><strong>On Diseases Following Beriberi</strong></p>
<p>Though suffering from beriberi, one may still have issues with stones, which must be treated with pressing stone remedies. When diseases arise due to beriberi, various remedies can be applied. If there are difficulties with urination, then herbs like polyporus and poria, along with other diuretics, should be used for treatment; if bowel movements are extremely hard, then the Five Soft Hemp Seed Pills and similar remedies should be used; if the body is swollen and water retention occurs, then one should use remedies from the water treatment prescriptions. The same approach applies to other ailments, and there should be no restriction.</p>
<p><strong>On the Urgency of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Whenever there is a slight abnormality in symptoms, one must be greatly alarmed and decisively treat it as a priority, without delay. If qi rises into the abdomen, whether it is swollen or not, the chest and sides may feel full, and qi rises to the shoulders; if it is urgent, death can occur in an instant, while a more moderate case may lead to death within several days. One cannot afford to delay. Signs of urgency include a rapid pulse, constant shortness of breath, instances of sweating, alternating chills and fever, persistent vomiting—all of which indicate a likely fatal outcome.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>On the Efficacy of Medication: Real and Imagined</strong></p>
<p>All cases of beriberi result from an excess of vital energy, leading to death; there has never been someone who died from taking medicine that caused deficiency. Therefore, those with beriberi should not receive excessive tonics, nor should they undergo drastic purging; ultimately, they need not fear deficiency, hence they should avoid preemptive herbal concoctions. Those who do otherwise tend to perish unheeded.</p>
<p><strong>On the Examination of Patients and Inquiry into Illness</strong></p>
<p>In the world, there are many patients whose friends and acquaintances come to inquire about their ailments, yet such individuals often lack practical experience and have never consulted a remedy. They claim to possess knowledge, misleadingly presenting themselves as experts and spouting erroneous theories; some say it is deficiency, others claim it is excess, some declare it is wind, while others assert it is sorcery; some attribute it to water or stone phlegm, presenting a myriad of fallacies and contradictions. This confuses the patient, leaving them uncertain, and as time is fleeting, disaster can strike suddenly, causing everyone to disperse. Therefore, it is crucial to have reputable individuals or esteemed doctors who understand the nuances of illness, explore remedies deeply, and possess a comprehensive understanding of historical and contemporary practices. Only those with clarity on these matters should examine patients; otherwise, it can lead to grave mistakes. I lament the many who fail in this regard, thus I seek to elucidate these matters clearly, providing detailed descriptions of ailments, enabling future patients to protect themselves. However, if any symptoms match, one must adhere to an appropriate remedy and not rely on the theories of outsiders, thereby inviting unnecessary distress and regret. By understanding the prescribed remedies, healing is not difficult; one must not trust misleading words that lead to self-deception. I have once prepared a decoction of winter cherry, which has proven effective for treating beriberi; patients must use it urgently.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>On the Examination of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>In cases of &quot;flat-foot disease&quot; (脚气), although many examinations and observations are made, it is vital that the three positions of the pulse do not contradict the four seasons in order to be auspicious; if they oppose the four seasons, do not treat. As mentioned in the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; I shall not elaborate here. Those who are originally slender and dark are easier to treat, while those who are large, with thick flesh that is red or white, are difficult to cure. People with darker skin endure wind and dampness better, while those with red or white skin do not. Thin individuals have firm flesh, while fat individuals have soft flesh; soft flesh is more susceptible to deep-seated diseases which are harder to cure.</p>
<p><strong>On Swelling and Non-Swelling</strong></p>
<p>When a person suffers from &quot;flat-foot disease&quot; for a long time without recognizing it, and later develops another illness which resolves, they may then suffer from vomiting and weakened feet again. Upon diagnosis, I inform them they have flat-foot disease. The patient replies, &quot;I have never suffered from swollen feet; why do you call it flat-foot?&quot; They refuse to take the medicine. I regard it as a stone manifestation. In the midst of uncertainty, they die within a short period. Hence, flat-foot disease should not only be considered through swelling; there are cases with swelling and without swelling. Those who experience stubborn lower abdomen numbness often do not have swollen feet. Stubborn lower abdomen issues for merely three to five days can lead to vomiting, a condition termed &quot;flat-foot invading the heart.&quot; Such cases are perilous and may result in death imminently. In general, when flat-foot disease reaches the heart, it is difficult to treat, as kidney water overcomes heart fire.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>On the Need for Caution</strong></p>
<p>In the case of beriberi, one must be particularly cautious regarding sexual activity, mutton, beef, fish, garlic, shepherd’s purse, mustard greens, wild greens, bottle gourds, alcohol, flour, ghee, unpasteurized milk, pork, chicken, goose, and duck. It is advisable to use carp heads in prescribed treatments. All these should be strictly avoided, and one must also refrain from intense anger. Only acceptable foods are polished rice, corn, fermented soybeans, scallions, leeks, garlic chives, peppers, ginger, and orange peels. Additionally, sour fruits and foods must also be avoided; those who consume them cannot recover. Fresh cow&#39;s milk and raw chestnuts are highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>On the Duration of Recovery for Those Who Can Be Treated</strong></p>
<p>Many people suffer fatal outcomes from beriberi, which can be categorized into three types: injury from sleeping late, arrogance and excessive pride, and doubt and indecision. These three conditions lead to certain death. Thus, it appears that there are genuinely no good doctors; even when good doctors exist, patients without the right disposition to accept treatment are quite rare. Just as a fine steed may go unrecognized by a wise trainer, and a talented mentor may find no one to teach, the same holds true for such illnesses. </p>
<p>Currently, for those who are ill and possess an appropriate disposition for acceptance, if I treat them, they can be cured in no more than ten days. However, for those without such a disposition, treatment is unnecessary. Even if it can be treated, recovery may never come. This principle applies not only to beriberi but to all diseases. Good medicine and wise words must be visibly appropriate; they cannot be forced upon anyone. Treatment should be given to those who have faith in it and not to the doubtful.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>On the Prescription of Decoctions for Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>The wind toxin enters the body, and there are three categories of pulse patterns. Internally and externally, the symptoms may appear similar, but the pulse will reveal the severity. If the pulse is floating, large, and slow, it is advisable to take two doses of the Sustaining Life Decoction, which should facilitate recovery. If the wind is strong, one should prepare the Decoction of Overcoming the Servant and add four liang of white atractylodes. If the pulse is floating, large, tight, and starts to quicken, the Bamboo Juice Decoction should be made. If the patient has a pulse that is weak and thin, the Wind Guiding Decoction is appropriate. This type of pulse is often due to deficiency. If there is severe deficiency with shortness of breath and lack of strength, one may prescribe a nourishing decoction in accordance with the temperature of the illness. If not yet recovered, the Bamboo Juice Decoction should still be administered. If the patient has a floating, large, and rapid pulse, this is the most severe among the three pulse categories. Alternatively, if the pulse is deep, thin, and rapid, it is equally a dreadful pulse. A floating, large pulse indicates an external illness, while a deep, thin one indicates an internal ailment; treatment methods do not differ, and one must be attentive to the pulse&#39;s indications. The appearance may still be acceptable, yet if the hands and feet remain weak, the life force may diminish rapidly, and within a few days, there could be a fatal outcome.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>In such a condition, there are often those who may experience it, yet none survive. It is imperative to urgently take Zhuli Decoction, consuming one dose daily, ensuring that the decoction is constantly available without a gap of half a day without it. This decoction has a high content of bamboo leaf juice; if taken when less than very hot, it will remain in the heart and cause further harm. Each time, it must be taken extremely hot. If the Zhuli Decoction induces a downward effect, it is certainly beneficial. If after taking three doses of Zhuli Decoction the pulse remains unchanged and there is severe bloating, one can use a large turtle shell decoction to induce a downward action. If the decoction is exhausted and does not induce movement, one can use pill medicine to assist the decoction in this regard. Subsequently, continue taking Zhuli Decoction to ensure the pulse is weakened and to stabilize the breath before stopping. One may then take the Thirty-Two Description of Eight Winds powder. Furthermore, at the onset of the illness, one should apply wild kudzu paste twice daily; this will alleviate stubborn numbness and weakness in the legs. If having consumed Zhulii Decoction, the pulse weakens as if in health, and strength gradually increases yet the legs are still unable to move, one should eventually begin to take small steps. In severe cases, after recovery, it may take half a year before one can walk with assistance.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>Once the pulse and body feel healed, one should diligently take the Eight Winds Powder. Do not treat lightly just because the feet cannot walk; such light treatments may not bring full benefits and can lead to worse conditions, thus losing the effectiveness of the treatments. Do not hastily apply wild kudzu paste on the edges either. If someone hears about Bamboo Sap Decoction and fears it may harm the waist or feet, do not administer it. It is important to understand this method; it is not suitable for everyone, and thus should not be given indiscriminately. This caution is to clarify misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Bamboo Sap Decoction has three variations: for mild cases, take the initial method; for severe cases, follow with the later method progressively. This wind toxin can easily infiltrate, so patients should take the Small Golden Tooth Powder in empty doses and apply a little in the nostrils and ears. Those who are weak, recently deceased, overly sensitive, or strong should also take it and apply it to the ears and nostrils. Those near the deceased or observing the sick should carry a small dagger in a red pouch; males on the left arm and females on the right, to counteract toxins. It is advised to start with a small dose.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Patients should drink adzuki bean tea and, in winter, take Cezi Golden Tooth Wine and Xuming Decoction. This is for treating wind toxin illnesses, which initially appear similar to seasonal epidemic diseases; however, the pulse remains floating and weak without change. Those who feel better should not be treated, as some may die within a few days or in ten days. Symptoms may include confusion, jaundice, rash, red eyes, or severe necrosis in the lower body. This is urgent; upon diagnosis, administer Xuming Decoction immediately, followed by Ge Gen Decoction and Ma Huang Decoction. If this does not yield results, continue with two or three more doses of Xuming Decoction, which will certainly lead to recovery. This illness is extremely critical, and one must ensure the medicinal broth continues without interruption for even half a day; otherwise, it could be fatal. The disease known as &quot;foot qi&quot; originated in Lingnan and can also be found in Jiangdong. Symptoms may include slight feelings of pain or numbness, swelling of the legs, weakness when walking, numbness radiating to the abdomen, alternating sensations of heat and cold, difficulty urinating resulting in urgency or congestion, shortness of breath, a feeling of suffocation in the throat, and an inability to eat due to nausea. If these symptoms are present, first administer Xijiao Xuanshu Hua Decoction.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Human Health Manual</strong><br><strong>[Song Dynasty] Zhu Gong</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Athlete&#39;s Foot</strong>  </p>
<p>Cold-induced illnesses primarily affect the feet rather than the hands. The cold, heat, dampness, and wind of the earth create steaming vapors; frequent exposure to these elements leads to athlete&#39;s foot, causing its symptoms to resemble those of a cold. The pulse tends to be floating and string-like due to wind, moist and weak from dampness, surging and rapid from heat, and slow and thin from cold. For wind-related issues, sweating is the remedy; for dampness, warmth is needed; for heat, purging is beneficial; and for cold, applying heat helps.  </p>
<p>The onset of athlete&#39;s foot can be subtle and is often recognized only due to other illnesses. Toxic energy entering the heart leads to numbness in the lower abdomen, causing vomiting, which can be lethal rapidly. However, it remains distinct from colds; as Master Sun noted: a sudden weakness in the feet that prevents movement signifies this difference.  </p>
<p>In summary, individuals with athlete&#39;s foot typically experience symptoms starting from the feet, which may first present as mild weakness or pain, with pain resulting from excessive cold, leading to a painful sensation. Sometimes, individuals may suddenly collapse while walking, experience swelling and pain in the legs, or suffer from thin and weak legs, palpitations, or numbness in the lower abdomen. The prolonged nature of the illness leads to deep internal complications, hindering the smooth circulation of vital energy and resulting in skin that lacks nourishment, leading to numbness. Numbness signifies that the skin is desensitized, unable to perceive what is present or absent.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>Some may experience body twitching, while others may see food and vomit, detesting the smell of food. They may feel fullness in the chest and urgency of breath, or have soreness all over, all indicative of &quot;foot qi.&quot; The Yellow Emperor refers to this as &quot;wind-damp obstruction.&quot; Chronic weakness is termed &quot;wind,&quot; while pain is called &quot;damp obstruction.&quot; Obstruction means a closure; being closed off and insensitive is thus termed obstruction. In the presence of cold among the three yangs, the issue must be cold; for this, use “Yuebi Decoction” or “Small Renewing Life Decoction.” When “Small Renewing Life Decoction” is prepared, add fresh ginger juice for the quickest effect. In the presence of heat among the three yins, the issue must be heat; modify “Small Renewing Life Decoction” by removing aconite and reducing cinnamon by half. For severe agitation, “Purple Snow” is best. For constipation, use “Spleen Contraction Pill,” “Divine Function Pill,” “Five Soft Pills,” “Big Three Abdominal Powder,” or “Papaya Powder.” The ailments of foot qi are all due to excess qi, and none have died from weakness caused by medication. Headaches with body heat, limb joint pain, and weak flexed feet indicate that the person has chronic foot qi, which is now being triggered. For swollen feet, “Betel Nut Powder” is indicated. For discussing foot qi, “Thousand Gold” and “External Treasury” offer the most detailed accounts, and thus will not be repeated here. Generally, “Yuebi Decoction,” “Small Renewing Life Decoction,” “Job&#39;s Tears Wine Method,” “Spleen Contraction Pill,” and “Divine Function Pill” are essential medicines. Acupuncture is also excellent. Taking tonics and using decoctions for washing are major prohibitions for doctors.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>Jisheng Fang</strong> 【Song - Yan Yonghe】</p>
<p><strong>Foot Disease</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; says that foot disease is caused by the invasion of cold and toxic winds. It further states: the cold, heat, wind, and dampness of the earth all produce steam, and when the feet are often exposed to this, foot disease results. However, in ancient times, there was no concept of foot disease; in the time of the Yellow Emperor, it was called &quot;Jue.&quot; Between the Han dynasties, it was referred to as &quot;Huanfeng,&quot; and after the Song and Qi dynasties, it became known as foot disease. Although the names differ, the essence remains the same. </p>
<p>From this, we can observe that cold, heat, wind, and dampness can all lead to this condition, not only cold and toxic winds. The disease usually goes unnoticed at first and may arise due to another illness, sometimes suddenly causing great discomfort, only to be felt several days later. It often begins in the feet, presenting as mild pain or weakness, sudden collapses during movement, swollen legs, thin and withered feet and knees, heart palpitations, numbness in the lower abdomen, cramps throughout the body, nausea or vomiting when seeing food, aversion to food smells, chest tightness and shortness of breath, or generalized aches. These variations in symptoms reflect the different manifestations of the illness. Generally, with cold conditions affecting the three Yang channels, there will be cold symptoms; with heat conditions affecting the three Yin channels, there will be heat symptoms. Indeed, these words are true.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>In discussing the pulse, the floating and string-like pulse arises from wind, the soft and weak pulse arises from dampness, the full and rapid pulse arises from heat, and the slow and rough pulse arises from cold. Wind is treated by sweating, dampness is treated by warmth, heat is treated by purging, and cold is treated by warming. For those suffering from foot conditions, acupuncture should be employed quickly. Using decoctions for washing is a major prohibition in treatment. </p>
<p>Foot ailments arise from kidney deficiency; however, women also suffer from foot conditions due to the deficiency of blood and the stasis of phlegm, as well as emotional disturbances such as anger and sorrow, leading to the development of this illness. Given that many women suffer from this, it can be understood that these ailments due to blood deficiency resemble those from kidney deficiency in men. </p>
<p>The treatment for women is fundamentally the same as for men, but must also include medications for emotional disturbances, which will always yield results. Furthermore, the methods of tonifying and purging should align with the four seasons: in spring and autumn, one should urgently tonify and purge; during summer, when conditions are severe, one must focus on promoting sweating; and after the onset of winter, one should adjust treatment according to whether the condition is improving or worsening, with slight nourishing added. </p>
<p>Otherwise, qi and blood will continuously weaken, leading to recurring issues every year with rising heat—a natural consequence. The general principles of treatment do not exceed this. In addition, throughout the seasons, one must be careful to regulate and manage, avoiding prolonged sitting or standing in cold, damp places, and during hot months, one should not expose oneself to damp areas. By being careful in these respects and treating according to the symptoms, recovery will certainly occur.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Instructions for Treating Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>Carbuncles arise when the lung meridian is overheated, manifesting on the fingertips and requiring urgent attention; if not alleviated within seven to eight days, they can be fatal. Treatment can begin within four days by puncturing. If a black sore is not too severe, treatment can still be effective; however, a severely black sore post-festival indicates death. Those that can still be treated after the festival require medicinal intervention. </p>
<p>The appearance is characterized by small, dark lesions as large as millet grains, while larger ones can be the size of plums, ranging in color from red to black, occasionally showing blue and white, often surrounded by a solid core, which is the root. They are not swollen, but may be excruciatingly painful, affecting the heart and reaching the bones, and may also cause the body to feel warm. If treatment is delayed, the poison ascends, causing the face to swell with purple-black blisters that can corrupt the organs, leading to death. </p>
<p>In the south, this condition is known as &quot;toxic invasion,&quot; as there’s a fear that cutting off the fingers will allow the poison to spread upwards, leading to a high chance of fatality. Sudden, sharp pains in the fingertips that seem unbearable may appear red or yellow, or dark blue or black. If there is foul-smelling blood or pus between the teeth, death is likely within seven days. </p>
<p>For those with thickened flesh, one should excise the affected area and cauterize it with iron until charred like coal. It is also advisable to apply moxibustion over the carbuncle vigorously, and to take juice from sunflower roots, woad flowers, bamboo sap, rhinoceros horn juice, bitter orange soup, and detoxifying drinks. If one vomits pus and blood and does not seek treatment, one should cover the pus and blood with ash. If not, the toxic gas can infect others. Carbuncles can cause immediate harm, as evil winds penetrate the muscle and veins, initially going unnoticed. </p>
<p>Once the poison has become congested and manifests fiercely, tiny and deep lesions may appear darkly or murkily. The ailment targets the heart; if the condition slightly eases, it can lead to organ invasion.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Foot Back Disease</strong></p>
<p>The foot back disease arises from symptoms of wasting thirst. If it occurs at the toes, it is called &quot;liu-jia&quot; (decomposition). Those with a purple-black color are fatal; if not purple-black, it can be treated. It is appropriate to take bitter herb pills.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>Arm toxicity is related to the heart and kidney channels, connected to the five fingers. The toxic gas flows and leads to leakage; this is malignancy. It should be treated with internal medication for gas flow and pain relief. This back elbow toxicity involves the flow of qi and blood, accumulating and forming toxins, which are abscess toxins. Use the pain-relieving internal gas flow drink.</p>
<p><strong>Tendon Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Tendon abscess occurs between arteries, above the tendons, causing inability to bend or extend the arms. If not treated swiftly, it may lead to necrosis of tendons, resulting in chronic disease. If it develops on the arm, it is called &quot;chi-yin,&quot; characterized by redness, swelling, and pain. Initially, it should be treated with moxibustion; if it ulcerates, it may endanger life and must not be taken lightly. Internally, take internal expelling powders with added agarwood and bark of five-flavored plants, and also take yellow alum pills and shi-qi powder, frequently using protective heart powder; externally, use iron ring powder mixed with ginger juice for application.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p>
<h3>Heavenly Snake Poison</h3>
<p>Heavenly snake poison arises when the heart is afflicted by wind injury at the fingers, elbows, and arms. This signifies a severe toxic condition, and one should treat it with a pain-relieving and qi-flowing drink. If this condition has not yet matured, it is inappropriate to immediately use knives or needles to pierce the corrupted flesh, as it may aggravate the situation. If it becomes deeply rooted, it will be difficult to treat, and even after breaking down, it may take years to regenerate flesh; one should apply Erhuang San to the area.</p>
<h3>Arm and Face Poison</h3>
<p>Arm and face poison manifests on the surface of the arm, resulting from blockage in the liver and lung meridians, leading to stagnation of qi and blood which gathers into toxins; this is a severe condition. One should use a detoxifying and qi-flowing drink, followed by a pain-relieving internal tonic. Surrounding the affected area, one should apply Jinku San as a poultice.</p>
<h3>Palm Poison</h3>
<p>Palm poison affects the right hand due to yin fire. The qi and blood of the Taiyin and Yangming flow into the left Jueyin meridian, while the poison of the left hand arises from heart fire, with the Taiyang flowing into the right foot Taiyin Yangming. The earth regenerates flowing through the five phases—mother and child generating and nurturing each other. This condition may stem from emotions like joy, anger, worry, and thoughts, or from cold congealing qi and blood, leading to blockage and toxin accumulation. One should use a pain-relieving and detoxifying medicine, followed by an internal tonic to promote qi flow, and externally apply Jinku San as a poultice.</p>
<h3>Wrist Poison</h3>
<p>Wrist poison occurs on the back of the hand, resulting from wind, cold, joy, anger, fright, and phlegm affecting the heart, with blood failing to circulate, resulting in toxin formation. One should use a pain-relieving and poison-expelling powder, along with an internal tonic for clearing qi. It may be applied through the palm or the outer wrist, and further treated with Sanyang Neituo San.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>On feverish conditions</strong><br>The conditions of the lesser yang channel often exhibit more qi and less blood, as the lesser yang possesses a corresponding fire, even more so than the extreme yin. This is due to excessive worry and mental labor, influenced by external forces and internal emotions. It is advisable to anticipate difficulties in muscle growth and to avoid reckless use of harsh medicines. However, if the symptoms manifest as red swelling, similar to millet, do not underestimate them merely due to their small size.</p>
<p><strong>On cold sores</strong><br>Cold sores arise from the alterations in nutritional intake, lingering toxins from wind and dampness, and prolonged exposure to cold weather. These conditions attack the area below the knee and affect the spleen channel. Initially appearing like grains of rice, they gradually become ulcerated, resembling coal in color, as putrid blood invades and damages bone and flesh, leading to significant issues. Over years, the joints cause pain and do not regenerate muscle. Begin treatment with an infusion of mugwort, snake bed seed, perilla, and agrimony for washing, and internally take medicines like astragalus, white atractylodes, black atractylodes, angelica, white peony, forsythia, and raw rehmannia. For external treatment, apply a medicinal paste wrapped in paper. Also, focus on internal reflection to alleviate labor or strain.</p>
<p><strong>On ulcerations</strong><br>Generally, the symptoms in the lower body primarily involve black atractylodes, complemented by the pungency of coptis, and combined with green tangerine peel, along with licorice. Use targeted medications according to the symptoms, and you shall obtain results. This poison affects the liver and kidney channels, causing unbearable pain, treat it with internal methods to remove stagnant qi. For external application, utilize leg wind remedies, and the same treatment as for women&#39;s ulcerations can be used.</p>
<p><strong>On the poison in the Weizhong point</strong><br>This poison affects the kidney channel, resulting from cold air obstruction. Modify the treatment with perilla qi-moving drink. Start with the detoxifying qi-moving drink, followed by the perilla qi-moving drink, adding astragalus when expelling pus.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br><strong>Leg Wind</strong></p>
<p>This boil is located in the small intestine and kidney meridians, caused by cold and heat, with evil energy and toxins flowing through both legs; this is known as wandering toxicity. One should use a perilla (zisu) decoction to treat it, followed by a decoction to dispel toxicity. For external treatment, first apply golden silk paste for four to five days to draw out the toxic fluid, and then use ointments for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>Crane knee wind is akin to dysentery wind and drumstick wind. The circulation of qi and blood harmonizes throughout the body; if affected by cold, the flow slows down and is insufficient, whereas heat stimulates it too rapidly. Internal injury from emotional distress or external injury from environmental factors leads to irregular circulation of qi and blood, resulting in illness. It often stems from prolonged heat accumulation followed by invasion of damp heat, obstructing the flow of blood and causing pain, particularly at night. Treatment requires warming and dispersing the cold dampness and expelling the accumulated heat. When blood flows freely in harmony with qi, the illness ceases. Alternatively, if one hastily resorts to potent medicines, suffers from overexertion, indulges in rich foods, or is affected by wind and rain, leg swelling and severe pain may arise from stagnant blood in the meridians. If left untreated for an extended period, it may lead to atrophy, resulting in knee swelling, muscle tightening, and severe pain, with weakness and gradual thinning of the legs, and dry, frail thighs and calves that cannot flex or extend. The appropriate treatment is to dispel wind, regulate qi, nourish blood, strengthen tendons, and remove dampness, allowing the smooth flow of qi and blood, leading to a natural recovery.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>Knee Eye Poison</strong></p>
<p>This poison affects the kidney channel and bladder, causing stagnation of qi and blood, while damp heat attacks the knee eye, forming poison. For treatment, apply crane&#39;s knee wind medicine externally, and use fragrant liquor decoction internally.</p>
<p><strong>Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Commonly said to be hard and without pus, little do people know that the swelling and hardness is due to internal pus that cannot surface at once. It needs to be guided out from within before one can pierce it with a needle.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Groove Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone groove abscess occurs above the knee and at the ankle wrist. Its pain feels like a knife-cut, while its itching is akin to insect-biting. Urgently use moxa on the abscess three to five times, then apply frankincense universal plaster, and take alum pills.</p>
<p><strong>Foot and Hand Manifestation</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from heat in the heart channel, resulting in uneven walking that harms the foot, causing blood to accumulate and form an abscess. The treatment is the same as for cold, leakage, damp poison.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Fistula Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition appears between the hand&#39;s yangming channels, initially as a grain and gradually enlarging like a red bean. The pain is unbearable, and it can grow to the size of a bayberry, with no blood or pus emerging, while poison flows through the channels and spreads throughout the body. Those with this ailment should be cautious; it cannot be viewed lightly. It&#39;s advisable to use methods for treating sores, adjusted accordingly.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p>
<h3>Foot and Leg Conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Foot Malady</strong></p>
<p>This condition affects the kidneys and connects to the Yangming meridian, causing pain in the heart. To treat it, use remedies for knee pain, heel sores, and &quot;crane knee wind.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Heel Sores</strong> (also known as &quot;cow pupa worm,&quot; &quot;earth chestnut&quot;)</p>
<p>These sores develop on the heel, typically due to injury from movement. They appear glassy with no pus, only a purple color, which means they should not be punctured. Initially, apply &quot;golden hoop powder&quot; or &quot;iron hoop powder.&quot; Avoid wind and cold; movement is not advised. First, take a purging medication to clear toxins, followed by a dampness-reducing papaya soup. Once ready to drain, use a needle to puncture and release the pus, applying golden silk and purple gold plasters.</p>
<p><strong>Shoe Lace Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Shoe lace ulcers occur beside the ankle, resulting from cold and damp exposure, leading to toxicity in the foot Yangming channel due to an accumulation of Qi and blood. Utilize &quot;pain-relieving flowing Qi drink&quot; for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Sole Malady</strong></p>
<p>The sole malady affects the kidney and heart channels in the foot, resulting in damp toxicity, termed &quot;sole carbuncle.&quot; One should take the &quot;pain-relieving flowing Qi drink&quot; alongside areca nut pills for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Wind Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>These ulcers arise from disturbances in women’s menstrual cycles, potentially occurring twice a month or being absent for a month. As a result, blood and Qi seep into the foot Yangming channel, leading to these sores. It is advisable to use &quot;wood fragrance flowing Qi drink&quot; and &quot;five accumulations powder,&quot; applying paper plaster externally.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p>
<h3>Kidney Qi and Wind Poison</h3>
<p>This poison arises in the calves, affecting the bladder meridian; cold air harms the kidneys and lurks in the bladder, which is known as wind poison. One should use perilla flow qi drink and apply iron hoop powder externally.</p>
<h3>Internal and External Ulcers</h3>
<p>Internal and external ulcers arise alongside the three li and at the sides of the yin intersection. They occur due to cold air attacking the lower abdomen through the kidney meridian, with internal invasion of wind evil and external assault by cold air, possibly resulting from a collision injury. These ulcers gradually become necrotic, with pus that does not dry up, caused by the interplay of damp heat and wind poison.</p>
<h3>Three Chains of Mole Crickets</h3>
<p>This condition appears on both hands in three varieties: upper, middle, and lower. They are all caused by damp poison damaging the skin, the qi and blood injuring the kidneys, and anger injuring the heart, leading to stagnant blood and qi conflicts, resulting in this series of poison chains. Treatment involves flow qi drink, three fragrant internal expulsion powder, and pain-relieving descent qi drink.</p>
<h3>Interstitial Abscess</h3>
<p>This condition appears on the arms and is caused by the blockage of qi and blood in the liver meridian, resulting in toxic accumulation. One should use expulsion flow qi drink and toxic elimination flow qi drink for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wind Poison Abscess</h3>
<p>This condition occurs between the toes, due to blocked qi and blood causing stagnation in the spleen and stomach, potential damage to the meridians, overconsumption of fried foods, or accumulation of toxins forming sores. It may also occur if the wind enters through a deficiency. A warming internal qi-regulating drink is recommended. Pregnant women should adjust the dosage accordingly.</p>
<h3>Definitive Theory 【Jin Chengwujia】</h3>
<h3>Sweating of Hands and Feet<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></h3>
<p>In cases of typhoid with sweating in the hands and feet, how can this be clarified? The limbs are the source of all yang energies, and the stomach governs the limbs. Sweating in the hands and feet is a sign of yangming. When the pathogenic heat of the yang meridians spreads and affects yangming, it causes sweating in the hands and feet. Yangming is the master of bodily fluids, and when ill, there will be spontaneous sweating. One may experience sweating all over the body, only on the head, or specifically in the hands and feet, all of which belong to yangming. Why does this happen? If there is sweating all over the body, it is termed “heat exceeding,” indicating that the heat is expressed outward. If there is only sweating on the head, it shows the heat cannot extend outward but rather ascends. Sweat in the hands and feet indicates that heat is concentrated in the stomach, manifesting as fluid discharge. The texts state: when the hands and feet sweat profusely, there is a likelihood of constipation. If there is dripping sweat from the hands and feet, and if the stool is hard with difficulty in speaking, purging will lead to recovery. From this, it is evident that sweating in the hands and feet is caused by heat accumulating in the stomach. Some may ask if sweating in the hands and feet can occur due to cold accumulating in the stomach. The text says: when there is cold in the middle, one cannot eat, there is difficulty in urination, and there is profuse sweating in the hands and feet; this is indicative of wanting to form a stubborn mass, and indicates cold in the middle. Furthermore, heat accumulating in the stomach is a sign that one can purge, while cold accumulating in the stomach is a sign that one cannot purge. How can this be clarified? To distinguish between these two conditions, it can be said that when constipation is followed by diarrhea, this is due to cold in the stomach, where food and fluids are not differentiated, hence it cannot be purged. However, if this is accompanied by difficulty in stool and the signs of yangming are present, it indicates that it is a purgable condition, and one should be careful in diagnosing the illness.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The Confucian Way of Serving Parents</p>
<p>Numbness of the Fingers</p>
<p>When an ordinary person first feels numbness or lack of sensation in the thumb and index finger, or if they are unable to use them, it is an indication that within three years there may be a stroke. It is advisable to first take a dose of Yu Feng Decoction and Tian Ma Pills, as this is a way to treat what is unwell before it becomes ill. Thus, the sages treat what is unwell before it becomes ill, rather than treating what is already ill.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Foot Edema in the Northern Regions</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When the sun prevails, fire energy becomes trapped within, dispersing outward, leading to swelling of the lower legs. Fluid accumulates internally, resulting in swelling externally. It also states: The spleen pulse is firm and long, and its color is yellow; this indicates illness characterized by a deficiency of qi. If it is soft and dispersed, lacking luster in color, this indicates foot swelling resembling water. </p>
<p>Those with spleen disorders experience heaviness in the body, muscle atrophy, inability to retract the feet, painful walking, and pain in the feet. This happens when excessive food intake generates insufficient qi and dampness accumulates below, thus dampness is received from the lower part. As mentioned, it is said that damp qi from the spleen and stomach flows downward, affecting the liver and kidneys, leading to pain in the legs and swelling of the feet. </p>
<p>The five grains enter the stomach, and the waste, fluids, and ancestral qi are divided into two channels. Thus, ancestral qi accumulates in the chest, exiting through the throat, traversing the heart and lungs to facilitate breathing. The nutritive qi secretes fluids, injecting them into the pulses, transforming them into blood to nourish the extremities and internally support the five organs and six bowels, responding to timely needs.</p>
<p>The defensive qi expels excessive energy and circulates in the gaps between the flesh of the extremities, constantly flowing without pause. Furthermore, the pathways of ancestral qi consider internal grains as a treasure; when the grains enter the stomach, they are transmitted through the pulses, overflowing within, spreading outward. The pure and specialized flow travels through the channels, continuously circulating, beginning and ending perpetually, which is known as the rhythm of heaven and earth.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Sometimes, improper diet leads to a failure of the stomach’s energy to invigorate and the spleen’s energy to transform. The energy flows through the hundred channels, descending and affecting the liver and kidneys. The interaction of earth, wood, and water converges and descends to the feet, resulting in swelling and pain in the lower limbs, which is what is referred to as &quot;gout&quot; in Jin, as called by Su Jing. </p>
<p>For treating this ailment, one should eat heartily for breakfast, eat less for lunch, and it is best not to eat dinner at all, for fear of injuring the spleen and stomach&#39;s operational energies and losing their natural balance. Moreover, eating at night causes stagnation of blood and qi, leading to increased swelling and pain. In ancient times, this ailment was rare, but since the Southern migration during the Yongjia era, many scholars have suffered from it. Following the establishment of the Tang Dynasty, those who were tasked with governance in the southern regions, where the land is low and wet, often suffer from it due to the accumulation of mist and dew, as they are not accustomed to the water and soil conditions.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>People from the northern part of Guanshi do not recognize this ailment. The texts &quot;Wai Tai Mi Yao&quot; and &quot;Zong Lu&quot; also indicate that this condition is common in Jiangdong and Lingnan. This is likely due to the attack of dampness on a weakened constitution, which is why the classics state that it harms the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. Hence, the creation of treatment plans is based on the specific conditions of the land at that time. </p>
<p>Now, observing the northern regions which are crisp and free of low-lying damp areas, and considering that the pores are tight and external pathogens are hard to invade, one wonders why there are individuals suffering from this ailment. It is likely due to excessive consumption of milk, rich wines, and damp foods, compounded by overindulgence in nurturing one&#39;s body that fosters dampness. As moisture accumulates and cannot be expelled, it settles in the feet and ankles, leading to prolonged swelling and pain. This issue arises from the consumption of these damp substances, which is distinctly different from how ailments are treated in the southern regions.</p>
<p>Thus, it is essential to consider the topography and dietary habits of the area, creating two treatment strategies: one to address the dampness of the land and the other to handle the impact of food and drink. Medications and treatments should be adjusted according to the prevailing conditions to align with the principles of Xuanqi.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>East Garden Ten Treatises</strong><br><em>Yuan Dynasty - Li Gao</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Distinction Between Internal and External Injuries to the Limbs</strong>  </p>
<p>Internal injuries, such as illnesses, occur when the vital energy of the heart and lungs is severed from the outside, leading to laziness and a propensity to lie down, with heavy and unresponsive limbs. This is due to heat damaging the original qi. The spleen governs the limbs, and when affected by heat, there is insufficient energy to move. The classics say that heat damages qi, and when heat is present, bones can decay and tendons can loosen; this is what is referred to.  </p>
<p>In contrast, external injuries from wind and cold indicate that the vital energy of the kidneys and liver has been severed internally. The kidneys govern the bones and are associated with cold; the liver governs the tendons and is associated with wind. Since ancient times, diseases of the kidneys and liver have been treated similarly because they support one another. Thus, the classics say that the gallbladder governs the tendons, and the bladder governs the bones.  </p>
<p>Whether it is a stroke or an injury from cold, on the day the illness occurs, one feels the need to lie down; it is not that one cannot be supported, but that the tendons and bones are painful and unable to move, thus indicating a physical injury. The classics state: &quot;Cold harms the form; cold causes the tendons to cramp and the bones to ache.&quot; This is what is referred to.  </p>
<p>For internal injuries and labor, along with irregularities in diet, if one experiences heat in the palms and coolness in the backs of the hands, it indicates internal issues; whereas, if external injuries from wind and cold are present, the backs of the hands feel hot while the palms do not. This distinction is remarkably clear.  </p>
<p><strong>Inability to Control the Limbs</strong>  </p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are deficient, one feels lazy and prefers to lie down, with involuntary limbs; during the autumn dryness, when damp heat diminishes, the body feels heavy and achy, with dry mouth and tongue, lack of taste in food, irregular bowel movements, frequent urination, loss of appetite, inability to digest food, and concurrent signs of lung disease, such as chills and a sad disposition, along with an unhappy, pale complexion—this is due to the yang qi not rising. It is advisable to promote the yang and augment the qi, and the formula for this is to enhance yang and strengthen the stomach.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>Athlete&#39;s Foot</p>
<p>The disease known as athlete&#39;s foot is indeed caused by dampness. Dampness harms the skin, flesh, muscles, and tendons and relates to the lower parts of the body; however, it can arise in two ways. One is from external influences, and the other is from internal causes, hence the treatment methods should differ accordingly. Thus, it is necessary to discuss this in detail.</p>
<p>As for the disease, it presents symptoms without a name; the term athlete&#39;s foot originated with Su Jing during the Jin Dynasty, and it was not known in regions such as Guanzhong or Heshuo. Only in the South does the cold underground water and the clear, damp air penetrate the people, leading to the condition from the feet. The classics say: &quot;When clear dampness invades the empty, the illness arises from the lower parts.&quot;</p>
<p>Some might argue: &quot;Now in the North, the land is high and cold, and the people have close pores; why are there still many cases of this disease? Could it not be caused by the dampness of the land?&quot; The answer is: the disease in the South arises from external causes, while the disease in the North is due to internal factors. How can this be explained? Northerners often consume too much milk and drink alcohol excessively, impairing their health without restraint. Milk, in its essence, has the nature of milk, while its form and quality resemble water; the same applies to wine and sweet drinks. As food enters the stomach, the stomach&#39;s energy rises and mingles its essence with taste, spreading through the meridians and transforming into qi and blood. This nourishment supports the extremities and feeds the five organs and six bowels, creating a cycle of response that corresponds with the rhythms of nature. This is known as the equilibrium of heaven and earth, which relies on the abundance of vital energy when the spleen and stomach are uninjured.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>If the vital energy is insufficient, then the foundational energy of the stomach is inherently weak. When intake of food is excessive, the energy of the spleen and stomach gets injured, unable to properly transform and digest what is consumed; the essence and flavors cannot circulate smoothly, causing the nature of dampness to flow downward. Those conditions originating externally stop at the lower limbs, causing swelling and pain; while those arising from within might even reach the joints of the hands. The classics state that swelling of the feet and lower limbs is caused by water, with heavy swelling being due to the arrival of the Taiyin; this describes only the external causes. The methods of treatment have been elaborated by previous scholars. However, for internal conditions, there has yet to be a established treatment approach. Yang Dashou states that leg qi is a type of obstruction disease, treated with disseminating and unblocking medications to prevent Qi from becoming stagnant. If obstruction has already formed strongly, then cupping and removing the stasis in the blood is necessary. The classics say: if accumulation occurs, swelling and heat result. After cupping, treat with medication.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses the southern regions where the ground is weak and the water and soil are poor, influenced by mist and dew. The Jiangdong and Lingnan regions are generally like this. When transitioning from spring to summer, the mountains and forests are steamy and dense, and the air is filled with wind, dampness, and toxins; the feet may be affected, resulting in endemic leg qi. The symptoms include weakening and bending of the feet, gradually leading to pain and numbness, slight swelling of the shins, numbness of the lower abdomen, headaches, irritability, phlegm obstruction and regurgitation, intermittent chills and fevers, and difficulties in urination; in severe cases, it may attack the heart and become urgent, thus treatment cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to classical formulas; those skilled in this art, could they not be more prevalent among the Jiangyou region? </p>
<p>Regarding different methods, the northern regions are characterized by high elevations, exposed to cold and frigid winds.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>Their custom is to drink thick yogurt and eat meat. Among those who drink thick yogurt, those who consume quickly and in large amounts are considered capable. The classics say that excessive drinking leads to reversed energy, and it is stated that food enters the yin and nourishes the yang; now they are going against the yang way, which is considered a reversal. Thick yogurt and strong wine are damp and hot substances associated with drinking. Furthermore, overindulgence in nourishment increases dampness as the water quality descends, causing energy to stagnate—hence it settles in the legs and calves, leading to swelling and pain over time, which is a result of improper diet.</p>
<p>The &quot;General Discussion on Ventilation and Solidification&quot; states: When grains are abundant but energy is lacking, dampness resides below. Moreover, the dampness and heat of thick yogurt and strong wine are even worse than that of grains. The &quot;Essential Discussions of the Ultimate Truth&quot; asserts that when the yin is strong, fire energy becomes trapped internally, spreading outward, leading to swelling in the legs and lower limbs. This is what they refer to. Thus, when drinks enter the stomach, the vital energy flows forth, rising to the spleen, which distributes the energy upward to the lungs, connecting with the water pathways and descending to the bladder, allowing the water essence to be distributed widely, aligning with the seasons and the five organs, balancing yin and yang for constancy. If food and drink are excessive, the stomach and intestines become harmed, and thus the stomach energy cannot transform properly, nor can the spleen energy be distributed, leading to stagnation in the liver and kidneys’ regions, settling in the legs and feet, compounded by excessive sexual activity, resulting in excessive yin and deficient yang, eventually leading to chronic ailments.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Yang Dashou said: The illness of athlete&#39;s foot has historically been treated with purgatives, as it results from stagnation. However, one must not overdo it; excessive purging can harm the spleen and stomach, preventing qi from ascending and causing it to descend instead, leading to athlete&#39;s foot. On the other hand, if one does not purge sufficiently, the stagnant qi cannot disperse. Therefore, I have established formulas such as Qianghuo Daoti Decoction and Kaijie Daoyin Pill, which should be used based on careful consideration of the condition&#39;s nature.</p>
<p>The &quot;External Records&quot; states: First, avoid anger. Anger causes irritation, and irritation leads to the onset of athlete&#39;s foot. Second, refrain from speaking loudly. Loud speech damages the lungs, and when the lungs are harmed, it also triggers conditions. Additionally, one should not expose the feet; do not expose them to wind or water. Washing the feet with cold water is ill-advised, especially keeping the legs warm. Even in the summer, one should wear cotton trousers, and in winter, it is vital to keep the legs warm to induce a slight sweat, which is highly beneficial. Follow these guidelines for proper care.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>Athlete&#39;s foot gradually weakens and damages the body; one should cut the nails of hands and feet on the days of Yin and Chou, cutting only a little into the flesh to dispel wind and dampness. In summer, the pores open, so it is unwise to sleep exposed to the wind. Waking can cause discomfort, so keep evil energies from lingering. Regular movement of the joints keeps them unblocked. This is essential for health and a method to ward off wind and evil.</p>
<p>For usual strength, after each meal, walk three to five hundred steps. If you feel fatigued, stop; the bad energy from the feet will disperse immediately, even if swelling occurs, the energy cannot rise. </p>
<p>Firstly, regarding diet, avoid excessive alcohol and rich foods, as overindulgence damages the spleen and stomach, leading to swelling in the legs and causing foot ailments. Secondly, desires should not be indulged; excessive cravings will cause symptoms. After eating, it is advisable to walk slowly for two to three hundred steps, not sweating excessively; if you feel tired, stop to prevent congestion. The classics say: &quot;The unhurried person walks.&quot; They also state that those suffering from dampness and obstruction should avoid warm, over-satisfying foods and wet conditions.</p>
<p>Arm and Foot Pain</p>
<p>Arm pain has six pathways; investigate which path the pain resides in to treat the energy and blood using appropriate medicinal methods. If the pain is exterior, do not hastily administer treatment; it requires careful differentiation. For foot pain, treat new illnesses with methods for gout. Chronic foot problems do not arise from athlete&#39;s foot, but rather should be treated using methods for rheumatism. Each condition has its own diagnosis. Gout often arises from blood deficiency, allowing cold and dampness to invade.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong> <em>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</em></p>
<p><strong>Gout</strong></p>
<p>Gout requires the use of medicines that dispel dampness, raising the humidity and accompanying the flow of Qi and blood. For gout that affects the heart, it is advisable to use the Four Substances Decoction, adding fried Huangbai; also, use the Yongquan acupoint, applying aconite powder mixed with saliva, and then using moxibustion to draw out the heat downwards. </p>
<p>If there is muscle movement in the big toe extending to the thigh near the waist, this is due to overindulgence and exposure to wind and cold, so it is proper to use the Four Substances Decoction combined with wine, qinpi (orange peel), safflower, dried atractylodes, nanking (south star), and ginger, decocted for consumption. Gout may involve damp heat or food accumulation, with the flow being windy dampness or cold dampness. </p>
<p>To combat dampness, focus on ingredients like Xianjue (immortal atractylodes), Baizhu (white atractylodes), Fangji (stephania), and Chuanxiong (chuanxiong), or use the Six Substances Aconite Decoction or the Pain Relief Decoction with Angelica. For severe Qi stagnation, utilize the Zhouche Pill or Exclude Dampness Pill. If there is retention of fluid, employ Dongyuan&#39;s Open and Guide Pill. For resolving exterior signs, use Ma Huang&#39;s Left Meridian Decoction and other medicines, choosing according to the meridians. </p>
<p>If there is also phlegm, Qi cold dampness together, increase the dosage of Wujisan (Five Accumulations Powder) with papaya. For dual resolution, use the Dahuang Left Meridian Decoction or Dongyuan&#39;s Qianghuo Guide to Disperse Powder. If regulating the blood is necessary, utilize the Eight Flavor Pill, or the Four Substances with Qianghuo and Tianma, or the Four Substances with Huangbai and Nanking, or the Jianbu Pill. </p>
<p>For dispelling wind and nourishing blood, using the Du Huojisheng Soup is the most effective.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p>
<h3>Heel Pain</h3>
<p>Phlegm and blood heat are present. For blood heat, it is advisable to use Siwu decoction with Rhizoma Coptidis and Anemarrhena.</p>
<h3>Numbness in Hands and Feet</h3>
<p>Numbness in the hands and feet is related to qi deficiency; when it involves the body, it indicates damp phlegm or stagnant blood. Numbness in all ten fingers suggests that there is damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach.</p>
<h3>Limb Joint Pain</h3>
<p>For limb joint pain, Qiang Huo should be used to dispel wind and dampness. For obese individuals with limb joint pain, it is often due to wind-dampness and phlegm flow disrupting the meridians, indicating that Nanxing and Banxia should be used. For thin individuals with limb joint pain, this signifies blood deficiency, and Siwu decoction should be combined with Fangfeng and Qiang Huo. If a thin person exhibits impatience along with limb joint pain and fever, it indicates blood heat, and Siwu decoction should include Huangqin and wine-fried Rhizoma Coptidis. If there is swelling and pain in the joints with a slippery pulse, drying dampness is necessary, recommending Cangzhu, Nanxing, along with qi-moving herbs such as Mukang, Zhihua, and Binglang; if it is below, add Hanfangji. If there is swelling and pain in the joints with a thin and rapid pulse, this signifies stagnant blood, suggesting the use of Tao Ren, Honghua, Danggui, Chuanxiong, and a light dose of Da Huang. If there is fatigue and weakness accompanied by limb joint pain, this indicates qi deficiency, possibly with phlegm flow, and it is best to use Ren, Shu, Xing, and Ban.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hand Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>Hand pain manifests as swelling and discomfort, affecting the palm, fingers, and arms. For treatment, use Wujin Decoction or Juanbi Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>Arm pain can result from wind, cold, or dampness attacking the area, or from fluids accumulating, or due to lifting heavy objects. This may lead to swelling in some cases and not in others. Excluding cases of fluid accumulation, other types of pain should be treated with Wujisuan or Wuyao Shunqi Decoction, or Juanbi Decoction. Blood deficiency can also cause arm pain, as inadequate blood nourishes the muscles; for this, use a combination of Juanbi Decoction and Four Substance Decoction. Nursing mothers who rest their arms on their children might experience arm pain due to wind and cold; they should also refer to this treatment. If pain arises from wind and dampness while sitting or lying down, or if the arm is exposed to cold while sleeping, Wujin Decoction, Juanbi Decoction, and Wuyao Shunqi Decoction are recommended. If dampness is confirmed, for Juanbi Decoction, add three qian of cangzhu and four fen of fangji; or use Wubing Decoction. If pain resulted from a previous heavy lifting injury, apply Hu Po San, Jie Rong San, or Heqi Decoction, and add half a qian of fresh turmeric to benefit the arm.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Athlete&#39;s Foot</strong></p>
<p>Wind, cold, heat, and dampness, commonly encountered by the feet, lead to athlete&#39;s foot. Various pathogenic factors, whether they have been present for a long time or recently, and regardless of which meridian they belong to, can be treated with a herbal decoction to eliminate dampness, adding half a tael each of papaya, betel nut, and white atractylodes. Alternatively, one can use a powder of hydrangea and angelica, adding half a tael each of red peony and aroid. It is also advisable to take papaya pills regularly. </p>
<p>When athlete&#39;s foot flares up and causes unbearable pain in both feet, use the Five Accumulations Powder, adding three to five whole scorpions, and decoct in wine. During a flare-up, one will also experience body aches and fever; therefore, do not recklessly use cold medicine, as athlete&#39;s foot may resemble mild cold illnesses. If one suddenly feels weakness in the foot, numbness in the lower abdomen, cramps in the entire body, nausea or vomiting after eating, or redness and swelling in both shins, treat it as athlete&#39;s foot.</p>
<p>For dry symptoms, either of the previous two herbal formulations may have half a tael of stir-fried and crushed radish seeds added. For wet symptoms, add ten or more strips of green tangerine peel to the previous two medications. Remember, athlete&#39;s foot must not be treated with cold treatments; nor should cold medicines be used indiscriminately, as warmth is needed to disperse the condition.</p>
<p>With athlete&#39;s foot, one may observe a puncture approximately half an inch deep; every half day, pain may be distinctly abnormal. This indicates that athlete&#39;s foot has formed a discharge. Treat it by applying the essence of white wood that has been calcined over fire to draw out excess moisture, dripping it into the sore.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>For persistent heat due to athlete&#39;s foot, use Baidu San with one qian of papaya, or mix equal parts Baidu San and Wujisan, known as Jiaojia San, adding one qian of papaya. If the condition results from prolonged wetness, leading to swelling or sores on both feet, use Wuling San or Heqi Yin, adding half a qian each of papaya and radish seeds, along with one qian of rhubarb. </p>
<p>If there&#39;s difficulty urinating due to athlete&#39;s foot, apply one patch of fresh Wuling San and one patch of Chuxie Tang, adding two qian of papaya, divided into two doses. If there’s no urine or stool passage, use Wuling San and Fuyuan Tongqi San.</p>
<p>For shortness of breath associated with athlete&#39;s foot, which pertains to the abdomen, it’s advisable to use Suzi Jiangqi Tang or Chenxiang Jiangqi Tang, supplemented with Yangzheng Dan or Simotan Yin. </p>
<p>If athlete&#39;s foot presses on the lungs causing coughing, use Xiao Qing Long Tang, adding one qian of betel nut with each dose, remade daily. </p>
<p>For loss of appetite due to athlete&#39;s foot, use Shengliao Pingwei San adding one qian of papaya. In cases of vomiting and nausea, use Eight Flavors Pingwei San with one qian of papaya. </p>
<p>For chronic athlete&#39;s foot with thin, withered legs that may feel cold or hot, or are painful or itchy, and may affect one foot more than the other, or appear weak and limp like a condition of wind, use Xiao Xuming Tang with papaya. Alternatively, one can use Duhuo Jisheng Tang, Fuzhong Bawwei Tang, swallow Huoluodan, or use the Tiger Bone pills.</p>
<p>If the condition is associated with blood deficiency, employ Xiongzhi Xiangsu, combining with papaya, Qianghuo, Chi Shao, Chuanxiong, and Zhizi. </p>
<p>For leg cramps, use Longjiao San.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>Foot Pain</strong></p>
<p>For foot pain, it is advisable to use two qian of Da Sheng San, mixed with half or one qian of wood melon powder, and adjust with bean soup wine. Also, use Chuan Jiao, fragrant Bai Zhi, and Cǎo Wū to brew a decoction for washing.</p>
<p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>

<p><strong>Principles of Medical Studies</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Dominion of the Limbs</strong></p>
<p>Yang governs the limbs. The classics say: &quot;The limbs are the root of all Yang.&quot; They also state that Yang receives Qi from the limbs. When Yang is sufficient, the limbs swell. The classic states: &quot;Accumulated Yang swelling in the limbs is this.&quot; When Yang is deficient, the limbs feel full. The classic states: &quot;Winter Qi disease in the limbs is this.&quot;</p>
<p>The spleen governs the limbs. The classic states: &quot;All limbs receive qi from the stomach but cannot reach the channels; this must be due to the spleen for them to receive it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Inability to Lift or Use</strong></p>
<p>When the spleen is full, the limbs are unable to lift. The classic states: &quot;When the spleen pulse is excessive, the disease manifests externally, causing one to be unable to lift the limbs.&quot; When the spleen is deficient, the limbs are unusable. The classic states: &quot;When the spleen&#39;s flesh form is insufficient, then the limbs are unusable.&quot; Furthermore, when the limbs lack energy, this is due to the spleen&#39;s essence not circulating. </p>
<p>In movement and qi, if the limbs are unable to lift, it all pertains to dampness. The classic states: &quot;When earth is excessive, it is said to be dense and mounded. The manifestations of this are abdominal fullness and inability to lift the limbs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Evil Residue in the Joints</strong><a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>When the five organs have pathogens, they linger in the joints. The texts state: if the lungs or the heart have pathogens, their energy resides in the elbows; if the liver has pathogens, its energy is in the thighs; if the spleen has pathogens, its energy stays in the hips; and if the kidneys have pathogens, their energy is in the knees.</p>
<p>Regarding leg swelling:</p>
<p>When there is swelling in the legs, accompanied by urinary obstruction, a feeling of fullness and discomfort in the chest, and digestive issues, it is advisable to use mild diuretics. Leg swelling often relates to excess lung Qi. The texts say that when someone has lung disease, there will be sweating, along with issues in the lower back, thighs, knees, and feet. Hence, the method of expulsion used by practitioners to treat leg swelling is based on this principle. Additionally, in the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions,&quot; those with excessive sweating should also adopt methods to drain the lungs.</p>
<p>There are 124 types of wind and 80 types of Qi, but when it comes to leg swelling, one must ensure medication is consistently used, while other treatments may vary according to the condition. Those who have wind Qi should expel it through proper channels in late spring, early summer, and late autumn to avoid severe complications. The term &quot;expelling&quot; refers to herbs like Ephedra, Qian Niu Zi, and loquat seeds; bitter cold diuretics are not necessarily required.</p>
<p>East Yuan&#39;s discussion on southern leg swelling indicates that it&#39;s caused by external invasion of dampness and should be treated with cold remedies, whereas northern leg swelling, stemming from internal injuries caused by alcoholic beverages, should be treated for damp-heat. This is something that previous authors have not fully expounded upon. In my view, it isn&#39;t necessary to differentiate between north and south for cold and heat. Any external invasion of cold and dampness should be regarded as cold-damp, regardless of geography. Similarly, any internal injury from alcoholic beverages is related to damp-heat, regardless of the region. Treatment should rely on pulse diagnosis and inquiry about the patient&#39;s condition.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>The texts from &quot;Wai Tai&quot; and &quot;Zong Lu&quot; state that the southern regions, characterized by their low, damp, misty, and dewy environments, lead to the people&#39;s skin being thin and weak, resulting in the inability of the Yang energy to be firmly expressed. Consequently, when they tread on the ground, the dampness envelops their emptiness and illness arises from below. This is due to a deficiency of blood and weak Qi, as they suffer from the evil influence of the dampness, which interacts with the blood at the skin level. When the evil is strong and the righteous Qi is insufficient, blood and Qi become stagnant; stagnation causes blockage, and weakness leads to further deterioration, thus giving rise to what later generations termed &quot;barley disease&quot; (or beriberi).</p>
<p>The &quot;Needling Classics&quot; states: since ancient times, there has been a method to eliminate these conditions, predominantly treating such ailments with moxibustion to drive out the dampness. In addition, consuming fermented beverages helps to regulate the channels and disperse the evil influences. Recipes were primarily constructed with more warming herbs than cold ones, using ingredients like ephedra, processed aconite, ginger, and prepared aconitum. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; asserts that excess dampness from the exterior should be expelled with bitter herbs. Ephedra, being bitter and warm, serves this purpose. Processed aconite is pungent and hot, aiding in mobility but lacking the ability to retain, thus facilitating the flow through the meridians. Ginger and prepared aconitum are pungent, sweet, and intensely warming, supportive of Yang energy while expelling the Yin, effectively dispelling the bad Qi of dampness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one should examine the three Yin and three Yang points in the feet to ascertain which meridians are involved, focusing on the medicinal treatments accordingly. It is essential to consider which of the six energies is relevant, and treat accordingly with supportive and guiding herbs. Master Sun said: &quot;The intent of the physician is key.&quot; Adjustments should be made according to circumstances, as there are no fixed prescriptions. Truly wise words indeed.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Arm Pain</strong></p>
<p>According to Dong Yuan, arm pain has six pathways of meridians. By utilizing the corresponding medicinal herbs that promote the flow of qi and blood in those meridians, the following applies: When both arms are extended straight, hanging down vertically against the body, with the thumbs positioned forward and the little fingers back, if pain is felt in the front part of the arm, it pertains to the Yangming meridian, treated with Sheng Ma, Bai Zhi, and Gan Ge. If the pain is in the back part, it pertains to the Taiyang meridian, treated with Gao Ben and Qiang Huo. If the pain is on the outer side, it pertains to the Shaoyang meridian, treated with Chai Hu. If the pain is on the inner side, it pertains to the Jueyin meridian, treated with Chai Hu and Qing Pi. If the pain is in the inner front, it refers to the Taiyin meridian, treated with Sheng Ma, Bai Zhi, and scallions. If the pain is in the inner back, it pertains to the Shaoyin meridian, treated with Xi Xin and Du Huo. Acupuncture methods should also be applied, depending on the respective meridian affected.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Li Zhan]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Beriberi</strong>  </p>
<p>The term &quot;beriberi&quot; refers to the phenomenon when the four environmental factors of wind, cold, heat, and dampness affect the feet, penetrating deeply through the meridians into the internal organs. The onset is gradual, unlike the four environmental factors confronting a person where the symptoms can be sudden and superficial. The external symptoms resemble those of a cold, with the possibility of transformation through the six meridians, such as a headache and fever resembling the Taiyang syndrome, progressing to the Jueyin syndrome of agitation and contraction, potentially leading to concurrent diseases.</p>
<p>Initially, there may be weakness in the feet and knees, with persistent stiffness and cramps, accompanied by redness and swelling as distinguishing features. In cases of Taiyang syndrome where pain radiates from the outer ankle along the meridians to the outer side of the little toe, one should follow the prevalent environmental factors for dispersal, using a formula such as Ma Huang Decoction, adding Feng Feng, Qiang Huo, Xi Xin, Ge Gen, Bai Zhu, and Fu Ling, or Bai Du San combined with Ping Su San.</p>
<p>For Yangming syndrome presenting with pain from the outer thigh and knee descending to the inner side of the middle toe, the treatment involves addressing the predominance of environmental factors, using Da Chai Hu Decoction with added Qiang Huo, Xi Xin, and Xing Ren, or Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction combined with Ping Su San. </p>
<p>For Shaoyang syndrome showing pain in the joints of the toes, one should harmonize using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, omitting Feng Feng, Ge Gen, Xi Xin, Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Mai Men Dong, Gan Jiang, and include Xiao Cao. </p>
<p>For cases where three Yang syndromes manifest together in cramps and constipation, adjustments can be made to the previous formulas, named Zuo Jing Decoction. Alternatively, for those specifically affecting the foot Taiyin meridian, if pain or swelling is observed on the inner side of the foot&#39;s big toe or inner knee, one should use Guo Gui Fu Decoction with added Fang Ji, Bai Zhu, and Fu Ling.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>When symptoms of the Shao Yin channel appear, there is pain beneath the little toe extending to the arch of the foot, with external pain in the popliteal fossa and the inner thigh, accompanied by chest congestion and inability to eat, a dark face, and difficult urination. If the lower abdomen is numb, treatment is difficult; use the Eight Flavor Pill to save. When symptoms of the Jue Yin channel appear, there is pain in the abdomen with the large toe linked to the inner edge and the navel, with cramps in the feet and dry vomiting; use the Nourishing Essence Pill. If all three Yin channels show cramping and weakness, with heat rising to the chest, sides, shoulders, and back, and descending to the feet and knees, with heat in the soles, use the Foot Exchange Pill. The essence is that excessive wind enters the liver, causing tendons to be oppressed; the pulse is floating with no sweat; use the Sustained Life Decoction with added Du Huo. For wind-damp swelling and pain, use the Wind Expelling Decoction or Betel Nut Powder. For painful, stiff tendons, use the Frankincense Pain-Soothing Powder. If damp is abundant in the Spleen, causing heaviness in the flesh, resulting in sudden falls or swelling, employ the Damp-Removing Decoction. For excessive phlegm, use this decoction to swallow the white pill from Qingzhou.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>Excess heat enters the heart, causing symptoms of breathlessness, irritability, and discomfort; the ailment must be heat-related, treated with Baidu San plus Dahuang. Excess cold enters the kidney, leading to acute pain and spasms in the bones; the ailment must be cold-related, treated with Wujisan, adding Mu Guo or combining with Qianjin Xueming Tang, Liuqi Yinzi, and Wuyao Shunqi San. For irritability, use Dan Zhuli drink. For constipation, use Sanhe San or Piyue Wan. If toxic Qi rushes to the heart causing pain, administer Suzi Jiangqi Tang with Yangzheng Dan, or use Wuzhuyu decoction mixed with ginger juice for quick relief; otherwise, death may occur unexpectedly. Commonly in spring and summer, use Binsu San with Chuanlianzizi; for heat-related swelling and redness, use Baidu San with Mu Guo and Cangzhu. In autumn and winter, use Wujisan with Mu Guo, Binglang, Niuxi, and Wuyuyu. It is most important to avoid nourishing soups and herbal poultices. Symptoms arising from Qi, diet, or minerals should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Differentiation between dry and damp conditions:</p>
<p>For &quot;Jiaqi&quot; (foot disease), noted in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as &quot;Jue,&quot; and called &quot;Huanfeng&quot; in the Han dynasties. Initially, the disease goes unnoticed, possibly triggered by another illness, leading to sudden heaviness and discomfort. Symptoms resemble cold and heat types of typhoid, but at first, there is sudden foot pain, which may transform over weeks into something different. In cases of dampness, the tendons and vessels become relaxed, elongated, and soft, possibly causing swelling or sores, referred to as &quot;damp foot disease,&quot; which should be treated with methods to drain dampness and dispel wind. Dryness indicates heat. In dry conditions, tendons and vessels contract sharply, lacking swelling, referred to as &quot;dry foot disease,&quot; and should be treated by nourishing blood and clearing dryness.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Internal and External Causes</strong></p>
<p>The internal cause is a fondness for rich food, dairy, and fine wine, creating damp heat that flows downward to the liver and kidneys. Coupled with excessive sexual activity, even the wealthy may suffer from foot ailments. The external cause arises from prolonged sitting or standing in moist environments, exposure to pests in mountainous streams, or the damp heat of summer affecting the limbs. In winter, the exposure to damp cold can lead to chilling effects. Additionally, cooling oneself in the wind, sweating, and entering a bedroom after drinking may contribute to these conditions. External issues result in swelling and pain in the lower legs, while internal damage may reach the joints and occasionally affect the whole body. At first, observe the source of the issue, and use garlic moxibustion at that point, which is quite effective. </p>
<p>When dampness is predominant, swelling occurs; use a diuretic soup with areca nut and lignum isatis. For swollen legs, utilize a red flower and root pill, and for overweight individuals, add phlegm-relieving herbs. If there is severe redness, swelling, and pain, grind euphorbia into a powder, mix with water to apply at the swollen area, and additionally take licorice decoction for immediate relief, or use a decoction for blood detoxification with rhizoma atractylodis and rhubarb, and phytotherapy for wind to smooth the qi. </p>
<p>When dampness is combined with cold, pain can occur; use Wu Ji San, Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San, Fu Zi Liu Wu Tang, or Sheng Jun Wan. </p>
<p>When dampness is combined with wind, there can be irregular pains; utilize Wu Yao Shun Qi San or Di Xian Dan; for more severe cases, use a mixture of red peony and chinaberry in equal parts, make into pills with wine for expulsion; if blood stasis is present, use Fu Yuan Tong Sheng San combined with Xiao Feng San. </p>
<p>When dampness is combined with heat, swelling and pain are severe; use modified Cang Zhu San, Er Chao Cang Zhu San, or Qing Zao Tang. </p>
<p>For food accumulation with damp phlegm descending, use areca nut and Cang Zhu pills.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Soft paralysis is caused by the dampness and heat affecting the liver and kidneys, leading to thick blood and qi, resulting in numbness and loss of sensation. If weakness is present, the limbs may become soft and slack, or develop numbness and inability to move. Treatments include San Miao Pills and Sou Feng Shun Qi Pills. The kidneys govern the bones; if deficient, the bones become soft. For yang deficiency, use Fu Hu Si Jin Wan; for yin deficiency, use Hu Qian Wan or Shen Qi Wan. For weakness and pain in the legs, use Da Bu Yin Wan, removing Rehmannia and adding White Peony, Anemarrhena, Licorice, and doubling the use of Eucommia. The liver governs the tendons; if deficient, the legs and knees may feel stubbornly numb. Use Yang Zhen Dan. For simultaneous deficiency of the liver, kidney, and spleen, use Wu Shou San Kui Dan. </p>
<p>When dampness is present in the lower body, add Fang Feng and Cang Zhu to remedies for qi, blood, and phlegm to lift the dampness. If the heart is affected, leading to disorientation and vomiting without appetite, and the pulse fluctuates between large and small, this indicates a severe condition; use Mu Xiang Liu Qi Yin or Su Zi Jiang Qi Tang with Zheng Yang Dan. If fire is present, use Si Wu Decoction with Huang Bo to reduce it, then apply powdered Fu Zi topically to the Yongquan point to guide the force downward. </p>
<p>For insensitivity and urgent breathlessness, use Zhu Yu San. For abdominal distension and agitation, use Song Jie Tang. If it affects the lungs leading to cough and wheezing, use Xiao Qing Long Tang with Areca. For liver involvement, causing dizziness and forcing sensation, use Wu Yao Ping Qi San.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>When the kidney is affected, causing swelling in the lower back and feet, difficulty in urination, darkening around the eyes and forehead, and the left wrist pulse is gone, one is doomed. Use Niu Xi Powder with Da Huang to save. If the kidney qi invades the heart, it is water overcoming fire; one must urgently use Ba Wei Wan to save. For symptoms of foot disease with chills and fever, swelling of the feet, heart disturbance, body pain, and imminent death, use Shen Jie Decoction. If there is no appetite, add Sha Ren, Qing Pi, and Mu Guo; externally, use an infusion of peach, willow, mulberry, locust, and catalpa branches to wash, reducing swelling and alleviating pain, preceded by consuming three to five cups of alcohol. It is especially important to avoid hot herbs and steams, for fear of forcing the pathogenic factors into the meridians; thus, treating the feet by opening the qi pathways is best.</p>
<p>With damp-heat invading the three yin meridians, and fire forming poisonous swellings, affecting the three yang, with chills and fever, vomiting, nausea, overall body pain, and heaviness, use Zuo Jing Decoction; alternatively, Xiang Su Powder with Mu Guo and Bing Lang. For emotional distress, add Wu Jia Pi and Mu Xiang. For pain, add Chi Shao and Ren Dong Teng. For women, add Dang Gui.</p>
<p>In cases of three yin interior syndromes, with fullness in the chest, palpitations, entire body cramping, and either constipation or diarrhea, use Qiang Huo Dao Zhi Decoction, Zhu Shi Dan, Dao Shui Wan, or Sou Feng Shun Qi Wan. If there is phlegm, use San Hua Shen You Wan. For food accumulation, use Kai Jie Dao Yin Wan. For interior deficiency, use Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction or Huan Tui Wan. If both exterior and interior symptoms are present, use Zuo Jing Decoction with Da Huang.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br><strong>Heel Pain</strong></p>
<p>For heel pain caused by excessive heat in the blood, use Siwu Decoction with additions of Zhimu, Huangbai, and Niuxi. If phlegm is present, use Wujisan with added Mu gua, or take Kaijiedao Yin Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Cramps in the Feet</strong></p>
<p>For cramps in the feet, if due to heat in the blood, use Siwu Decoction with additional Jiuqin and Honghua; if caused by dampness, use Chushi Decoction. Commonly used are two liang of pine resin and one qian of frankincense, baked slowly over low heat until fragrant, then ground into powder. For each qian, decoct Mu gua in wine and take it as a remedy.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br><strong>Sweating of Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>In cases of typhoid fever, when the body fluids from the stomach channel reach the exterior, sweating will occur in the hands and feet. If heat attacks the stomach channel causing fluid to be forced out, there will be accompanying symptoms such as dry feces and signs associated with the Yangming channel. If the stool is initially hard, the treatment should be Da Chaihu Decoction or Da Chengqi Decoction; if the stool is not hard but soft, Xiao Chaihu Decoction should be used. In all instances of typhoid fever where one wishes to purge, if urination is scant, and the palms, feet, and armpits are not moisturized, one must avoid purgation. If there is a cold accumulation in the stomach channel with initial hard stool followed by diarrhea, or if food and drink are not being properly digested, and sweating occurs, one should not purge but rather administer a small dose of Lizhong Decoction or Zhu Ling Decoction. If there is severe cold, a lack of appetite, and difficulty urinating, this may indicate the onset of a chronic condition, and treatment should include Lizhong Decoction along with medicine to disperse Qi.</p>
<p><strong>Twitching of the Limbs</strong></p>
<p>The limbs are the foundational Yang; the waist and back are the conduits of the Taiyang. Due to sweating causing the pores to become loose, if rest is insufficient, wind pathogens may re-enter the muscles and bones, leading to contraction and difficulty in movement. For this, Niubang Root Decoction is indicated. If there is twitching and grinding of the teeth, this indicates wind-heat, warranting the use of Chengqi Decoction. In cases where limbs are rigid and unable to move freely, with difficulty in bending and stretching, and the posture resembles curling up to avoid wind, this is due to excessive sweating and loss of Yang. If sweating is profuse and urination is difficult, Gui Zhi Decoction with added Fu Zi should be used. After vomiting and purging, if there is reversed cold and rigidity, Si Ni Decoction is indicated. If there is heart vexation accompanied by limb spasms due to blood deficiency, Shaoyao Gancao Decoction should be applied. For conditions where both Yin and Yang are compromised, and there are spasms in the hands and feet resembling wind symptoms, Guazhu Decoction is appropriate.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br><strong>Jiaju</strong> refers to a condition where toxic gas attacks the fingers and toes, causing the flesh to swell around the nails, leading to pain and bleeding, with worms in the sores. This can be due to injuring the skin when removing nails or the nails growing into the flesh, resulting in swelling and pain. For treatment, use five taels of green vitriol, place it on an iron plate, cover it with charcoal fire, and blow to make the fire hot, allowing the vitriol to melt and release red juice. Wait until the juice is gone, remove from the fire, let it cool, and grind it into powder that resembles yellow earth. First, wash with salted water, then apply the green vitriol as the main ingredient, mixed with a small amount of frankincense as a paste. For more severe cases, use five qian of green vitriol, one and a half qian of aloe, and a small amount of musk to make a powder. Place the affected finger in a silk bag containing the medicine, tie it securely, and keep it until healed.</p>
<p><strong>Dai Zhi</strong> refers to an initial swelling of the fingertip, accompanied by heat and intense pain, which then results in pus forming at the edge of the nail. In severe cases, the entire nail may fall off. Begin treatment by using a solution of Glauber&#39;s salt to wash the area, then prepare a paste using the kernel of a black plum mixed with rice vinegar, soaking the finger to heal itself. Alternatively, one can use pig fat mixed with crushed earthworms for application.</p>
<p><strong>Tian She Tou</strong> refers to sores that develop on the fingers or toes. If there is swelling and pain near the sore, soak the roots of a chicken mother poplar in vinegar overnight for relief. Alternatively, place realgar inside a chicken egg and soak the affected finger in it overnight. The next morning, burn a centipede and use the smoke to fumigate the injured finger one or two times to achieve healing. If there is severe pain and continuous bleeding, prepare a powder from realgar, centipede, and scorpion, applying it directly on the sore, then cover it with a cloth smeared with a bit of oil.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>Crane knee wind is caused by the deficiency of the three yin in the legs, allowing wind pathogens to invade, resulting in internal heat, reduced appetite, weight loss, and painful limbs. Over time, the knees may become swollen while the legs appear thinner, resembling the knee of a crane. Initially, it is advisable to use scallion poultices for internal resolution. If there is a combination of cold and heat, one should use a formulation with Wu Yao and Jiang Can. If there is already ulceration, Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction or Da Feng Feng Decoction should be utilized. </p>
<p>For those with yang deficiency where heat recurs, this is rootless虚火; use Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction or Da Feng Feng Decoction. If there is pain in the umbilical region, frequent urination, and phlegm with vomiting, apply Ba Wei Wan. If there is fever and significant thirst with a flushed face and a rapid pulse, it indicates severe blood deficiency, treat with Guo Gui Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of yin deficiency with emaciation and fever, administer Shen Qi Wan; if there is damp-heat present, use Cang Zhu Wan or Er Chao Cang Zhu San. For reduced appetite and a pale complexion, administer Liu Jun Zi Decoction. If there is insufficient fluid and qi in the body, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Wu Wei Zi added. If there is clear pus and inadequate muscle generation, apply Ba Wu Decoction. </p>
<p>For women with irregular menstruation, fever, thirst, and swollen painful knees, administer Shen Qi Wan, Cang Zhu Wan, and Xiao Yao San, adding Niu Xi, Du Zhong, and Huang Bai.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p>
<h2>Ulcer</h2>
<p>This ulcer develops in the two areas above, initially manifesting as swelling and pain. In cases of cold and heat, it is attributed to external pathogens of damp heat, treated with Pinellia Powder or Detoxifying Powder; if the toxicity is severe with cold and heat, use Lifesaving Drink. If there is diffuse swelling and pain, or if there is no swelling or pain, this pertains to the deficiency of the three Yin; if there are occurrences of cold and heat, both Eight-Treasure Decoction and Ten-Full Great Supplement Decoction are advisable. If there is spleen deficiency combined with exterior pathogens, use the Qi-Boosting Decoction with added Platycodon and Angelica dahurica. For spleen deficiency with damp heat leading to pus, along with dry mouth and poor appetite, use the Qi-Boosting Decoction with added Poria and Peony. For evening heat, add stir-fried black Coptis and cooked Rehmannia. If anger is present, add Gardenia and Chuanxiong. If there is stagnation, use Spleen-Returning Decoction with added Gardenia and Bupleurum. If the affected area appears dark and cold with a weak appetite, this signifies liver and kidney deficiency; Eight-Ingredient Pill is appropriate. For internal heat and dry mouth, use Kidney Qi Pill. If it does not heal for a long time, use Bitter-Sweet Herb Pill. For kidney wind deficiency, use Four-Birth Powder or Astragalus Pill. </p>
<h2>External Treatment Method:</h2>
<p>For wind heat, wash with scallion soup and then apply dragon bone ointment. For wind heat, use Horsetail Ointment. For damp heat, use kiln soil ointment. If due to blood and qi stagnation, add a little frankincense to Xiao Zhu Che Wan. </p>
<p>At the initial stage of the internal ulcer, wash with salt water, then apply wax alum paper. For severe cases, use tung oil ointment; for intense itching, use Qianai Ointment. If it has not healed for a long time, utilize both internal and external use of ash ointment to eliminate necrotic tissue, followed by applying yellow wax ointment. However, internally, medication must be dosed appropriately; if mistakenly using aggressive treatments that harm the stomach, it can also cause injury.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p>
<h3>Heel Ulcer</h3>
<p>The heel is the source of the Governing Vessel and the pathway of the Kidney. Internally, it arises from eating habits and daily activities that weaken the Three Yin of the foot, or it can be caused by bites from dogs or rabbits. For symptoms of swelling and decreased appetite, use the Ba Zhen Tang. For heat in the evening and dizziness, use Xiao Yao San or Shen Qi Wan. For coughing and phlegm, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang or Ba Wei Wan. If left untreated, it could drain energy and blood leading to death.</p>
<h3>Calf Ulcer</h3>
<p>An ulcer on the calf starts small like a grain and gradually enlarges; incessant scratching causes it to form patches that overlap, with yellow fluid flowing out and unbearable itching, eventually becoming a chronic illness difficult to heal. Start by washing with a decoction of Guanzhong, then apply a powder made from various herbs mixed with saliva, spreading it from the outside in.</p>
<h3>Cuff Ulcer</h3>
<p>Cuff ulcers occur on the shins, sometimes caused by impact from objects. The ulcer has a narrow opening but is wide beneath the skin, which is thin like bamboo film, causing extreme itching and pain, with yellow fluid streaming all day. They can persist for decades and are easily transmissible. Patients should abstain from sexual activity for easier recovery. A mixture of chives and earthworm dung can be used, combined with light powder and clear oil or blood from a white dog for application. Internal and external ulcers can also be treated.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br><strong>Foot Conditions</strong></p>
<p>For conditions involving damp heat descending, first use garlic moxibustion and the Vitality Drink to resolve toxin accumulation, then administer the Middle-Supplementing Qi Decoction and Kidney Qi Pills to replenish essence and qi. In cases of three yin deficiency, initially apply the Detoxifying Powder to relieve toxins, or the Detoxifying Powder plus achyranthes, betel nut, eucommia, or the Detoxifying Powder itself. After ulceration, use the Great Wind-dispelling Decoction, the Ten Complete Replenishing Decoction, or the Eight Flavor Pills. If there is heat in the foot soles due to yin deficiency, use the Four Substance Decoction with added anemarrhena and phellodendron. For spleen deficiency, use the Middle-Supplementing Qi Decoction. If the treatment focuses specifically on ulcers, it can be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Ingrown Toenail</strong></p>
<p>An ingrown toenail occurs when a narrow shoe causes pressure, leading to the nail embedding into the flesh, with swelling on all sides, yellow fluid discharge, and the skin becoming soft and rotten, gradually extending up the foot, leading to blisters rising like boiling water, increasing day and night, making movement impossible. Use a strong decoction of dried tangerine peel for soaking for a long time until the flesh and nail separate, then gently trim the ingrown nail part; externally apply a burnt snake skin powder mixed with four qian of realgar, and apply it dry. For those with dry nails, mix it with fragrant oil for topical application. Treat it alongside nail-related conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Toe Nail Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Toe nail ulcers occur when the sharp nail pierces the flesh, causing painful ulcers to become moist and rotten. Use three qian of dried alum and five fen of yellow lead powder, ground to a fine powder, and mix it in. Alternatively, use burnt powdered hog plum.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br><strong>Footback Sores</strong></p>
<p>Footback sores, also known as ulcerative sores, are named for their ability to rupture and discharge. They can also occur on the back of the hands and fingers. The cause is attributed to a diet of rich and heavy foods, which harms the spleen and kidneys. Symptoms may present as initial thirst before sores develop, or sores may appear first and then be followed by thirst. In mild cases, the sores appear red and painful, and can be treated. One should first use garlic moxibustion, and internally take revitalizing decoctions or detoxifying powders with added honeysuckle, angelica dahurica, and rhubarb. Once the pain subsides, one can use the Conclusion Powder, or take the internal Exuberance Powder with celestial flower powder and honeysuckle. For those with stagnant qi, the Sixteen Ingredient Flowing Qi Decoction is recommended. For those with deficiency below, the Complete Nourishment Decoction, Eight Ingredient Pill, or Large Bitter Orchid Pill may be used.</p>
<p>In more severe cases, the sores are dark in color and not painful. Initially apply garlic moxibustion and mulberry twig moxibustion, while taking tonic medicines to strengthen internally. This prevents the necrotic flesh from encroaching, increasing chances of survival. Additionally, injuries from biting or scratches might lead to sores which do not rupture or hurt, but extend in dark color. Such cases also pose a risk of severe complications. In critical situations, one must use a sharp knife to remove the affected tendons, allowing the poison to disperse. If the issue is located on a finger, the finger must be amputated; if on flesh, the affected flesh must be excised. For external treatment, use castor oil and unnamed herbs, boil together, then add a spoonful of Sichuan pepper. Depending on the size of the wound, slice perilla leaves and boil them together. After soaking, apply these leaves directly onto the wound to ensure comfort.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br><strong>Leaking Ankle</strong></p>
<p>There is a hole that forms above the ankle, approximately half an inch deep, accompanied by peculiar pain below for half a day; this is caused by damp heat leading to a leak. Use human-centered white (a type of remedy) to expel moisture and drip it into the wound.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Insights of Past and Present</strong> 【Ming Dynasty – Gong Xin】</p>
<p><strong>Beriberi</strong></p>
<p>The method of treatment involves using Atractylodes and White Atractylodes to address dampness; Huangqin, Huangbo, and Zhimu for heat; Danggui, Shaoyao, and Shengdi for regulating blood; Mugua and Binglang for adjusting qi; Qiangan and Duhuo to promote joint mobility and disperse wind-damp. Also use Mutong, Fangji, and Niuxi to guide various medicines downward, and to reduce swelling and expel dampness, forming the primary treatment for this condition. Additionally, acupuncture can be applied to guide the damp-heat qi outward. Dongyuan’s formula &quot;Danggui Nian Tong Tang&quot; treats this condition effectively, and students should study it in detail.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The pulse of beriberi has four patterns: a floating and wiry pulse indicates wind, and sweating is appropriate; a moist and weak pulse indicates dampness, and draining is suitable; a slow and thick pulse due to cold indicates warming is needed; a surging and rapid pulse indicates heat, and purging is advisable. A slightly slippery pulse suggests deficiency, while a firm and solid pulse suggests excess. A pulse that is constricted indicates concern, scattered indicates worry, tight indicates anger, and thin indicates sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Ulcers arise due to kidney deficiency and cold, with wind and toxic qi attacking from outside, affecting the sides of the lower abdomen. Wind-heat and toxic qi flow to the feet, causing ulcers that ooze and rot, accompanied by pain and foul odor, making walking difficult. These ulcers located on the hip bones are severe, as there is little flesh and thin skin over the bones, making healing difficult. Some may persist for many years with wide-open sores, rotten skin exposing flesh, producing an odorous and repulsive condition. The treatment should focus first on removing worms, followed by topical application; internal medications like wax and alum are also advisable. It is essential to sit with legs elevated and to avoid excessive walking, which may facilitate complete healing.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br><strong>Foot Qi Cold Type</strong></p>
<p>Foot Qi occurs when the feet are affected by cold and dampness, leading to headache, body heat, joint pain, constipation, and nausea. However, the pain may be localized to the feet, which can be swollen or shriveled, distinguishing it from typhoid. Xu Renze states: There are several types of this illness. One results from drinking cold water, which causes foot Qi, derived from the gradual accumulation of water vapor; another occurs when kidney energy is initially weak, and during the hot months, if cold water is used to wash the feet, the dampness does not disperse, resulting in foot Qi. Additionally, if kidney energy is already weak, imbalances due to a damp environment can lead to upward surging dampness, contributing to foot Qi. All these conditions can cause swollen ankles, heavy discomfort, and in severe cases, may even lead to discomfort in the heart and abdomen, making breathing short. There are also dry and wet types of foot Qi; the wet type has swollen feet, while the dry type shows no swelling but gradually feels dry, with skin issues that require careful observation. If one first feels stabbing pain in the chest or sides, along with fullness and discomfort in the chest and back, worsened after eating, accompanied by shortness of breath and heaviness in the limbs, with bone marrow pain and increased difficulty in breathing, especially after consuming greasy or spoiled foods, these are symptoms of foot Qi due to downward flowing dampness. If these symptoms are present, one should follow the appropriate treatment. If there is a progression of water vapor, remedies like Xixin decoction with eight herbs and Tianmizi pills can be used. If there are no prior symptoms but there is a sensation of swollen, aching, heavy, and dull feet, sometimes accompanied by acute pain or numbness in the lower abdomen, one should adhere to prescriptions like Wuzhuyu decoction with five ingredients and Sanggenbaipei pills with six ingredients, along with Zhezi liquor containing ten ingredients, to take carefully.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>In &quot;On Cold Damage,&quot; by Tao Hua from the Ming dynasty, the section titled &quot;Differentiating Cold and Heat in the Extremities&quot; discusses how to discern between cold and heat conditions in the limbs.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>It is said that the hands and feet are the extremities of the stomach and spleen. When there is heat in the spleen and stomach, the hands and feet will certainly be hot; when there is cold in the spleen and stomach, the hands and feet will certainly be cold—this is the common principle. However, in cases of a cold attack, there can be a deep cold and deep heat, or slight cold and slight heat. Why is this? It is said: If the stomach is cold, the hands and feet are cold; if the stomach is hot, the hands and feet are hot—this is the regular pattern of disease. However, extreme conditions can change things, so one should not be bound by ordinary reasoning. Excess leads to harm, and the response counters it. When fire energy is excessive, it can also involve water transformation, thus producing this phenomenon. Yin and yang alternate; the reversals of disease cannot be understood by regular theories. Phrases like &quot;cold extremities,&quot; &quot;cold limbs,&quot; or &quot;hands and feet cold&quot; are all expressions of variation and should not be analyzed lightly. </p>
<p>If we speak of the four limbs, there could be differences, and it cannot be solely attributed to a cold condition. If cold in the extremities reaches above the arms and below the knees, it is undoubtedly true cold, and one must urgently use warming medicines like ginger. If it is neglected for long, it becomes difficult to treat. This cold surpasses the elbows and knees; how could there be true cold within that extends to the limbs? However, one should also consider the pulse alongside the accompanying symptoms to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>In examining cold attacks, one cannot simply conclude it is cold due to a reversal; one must correlate with pulse findings to understand the situation accurately. For instance, if the hands and feet feel reversed along with abdominal pain, fullness, diarrhea with clear discharge, and clear urination, while there is no thirst and the person feels chills and trembling with a pale face, these all indicate a cold condition. Conversely, if there is abdominal pain with heaviness, diarrhea that is thick and sticky, dark urination, and thirst with a desire to drink, these all indicate a heat condition. Careful scrutiny is required.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br><strong>Self-Sweating</strong></p>
<p>The hands and feet are the foundation of all yang. When heat accumulates in the stomach and intestines, the fluids spread to the four limbs. When heat is trapped, it causes dry stools and delirium; if sweating occurs in the hands and feet, one should administer Da Chengqi Decoction. If there is water retention, it indicates that the fluids are not properly separated, and again, if sweating occurs in the hands and feet, one should warm with Li Zhong Decoction. This illustrates the difference between Da Chengqi and Li Zhong.</p>
<p><strong>Contraction and Rigidity</strong></p>
<p>Contraction and rigidity refer to the hands and feet being unable to move freely, with difficulty in bending and stretching, resembling a curled position suffering from wind. The limbs are the foundation of all yang; sweating leads to the loss of yang, and when yang is deficient, these symptoms arise. There is self-sweating with a floating pulse, frequent urination, restlessness, aversion to cold, and the feet cramping and tightening; one should use Shao Yao Gan Cao Decoction. In cases of taiyang disease, after sweating, if there is a continuous leak, aversion to wind, and difficulty in urination alongside contraction and rigidity, one should use Gui Zhi Jia Fu Zi Decoction. After vomiting and diarrhea, if sweating leads to fever, aversion to cold, contraction and rigidity, and cold hands and feet, one should warm with Si Ni Decoction.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br><strong>Ming Medicine Miscellany</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Wang Lun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leg Heat and Pain</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Below the knees, the legs sometimes feel internal heat, or there is a sensation of heat in the bones, or there may be slight soreness with heat. What is the cause of this?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> This is due to blood heat. In cases of wind disease, the blood must be hot. When the blood is hot, if the cold air from wind and cold invades, it binds the internal heat and causes pain. Danxi discussed gout, stating that blood heat meets cold, leading to filth and stagnation, which results in pain. Pain is worse at night, as it occurs in the yin phase; it also intensifies with wind, rain, and cold, indicating severe cold and dampness. Furthermore, in wind disease, the blood must be dry, as wind and wood generate fire, thus resulting in hot and dry blood.  </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mr. Chen from Linchuan states that to treat wind illness, one must first treat the blood; if the blood circulates, the wind will automatically dispel. The liver stores blood and governs wind. The liver qi represents yang and fire, while liver blood represents yin and water. If the liver fire is strong, the liver blood must be deficient. Therefore, for all wind diseases, many arise from the liver channels being troubled by wind and fire, necessitating enhancement of blood through the interaction and support of the five organs. The texts state: the kidneys store essence and govern bones; thus, if the kidneys are deficient, there will be heat in the bones. If there is internal heat in the Yongquan point of the lower legs and feet, one is often afflicted with bone atrophy to the point of being unable to rise, which pertains to the deficiency heat of the three yin of the feet. Nourishing its source of essence may help preserve life.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br><strong>Weakness of the Feet</strong></p>
<p>If the feet are weak and lacking strength, use two taels of Bu Yin pills washed in niuxi wine, one tael of roasted tiger bone, and five qian each of fangji wine and mujidian. </p>
<p><em>Note: This condition often arises from deficiency of the three Yin in the feet. If there is weakness due to insufficient spleen and kidney, use Huan Shao Dan; if there is deficiency heat in the liver and kidneys leading to weak feet, use Liu Wei Wan; if these treatments are not effective, urgently use Ba Wei Wan.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Case</strong>  【Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji】<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br><strong>Luò jū (Dislocation Ulcer)</strong></p>
<p>Dislocation ulcer refers to sores that develop on the toes or, if the foot is ulcerated, the white skin falls off; hence the name. There are also those that appear on the fingers, referred to as &quot;worm-eaten joint sores.&quot; In severe cases, the entire joint may decay; in mild cases, there may just be cramps in the tendons. For painful sores, dampness should be removed and toxins attacked, with a garlic poultice applied until no pain remains. </p>
<p>Whether the pain is severe or absent, the garlic poultice can still be used, along with detoxification medicines. If the color is black, immediate amputation is necessary, and rapid consumption of tonics is advised to save the patient. If the blackness extends upwards, it is untreatable. If the color is red and painful, one should clear away the toxins thoroughly and apply more cauterization. </p>
<p>In cases of thirst, nourishing yin and lowering fire is recommended. If the color is black, it is untreatable. This condition arises from excessive consumption of rich foods, wine, and cooked greasy substances that accumulate toxins. Sometimes it results from careless sexual activity leading to depletion of kidney water, or from improper consumption of medicinal stones that can cause thirst before illness or illness before thirst. Both occur because the kidney water is insufficient to control fire. </p>
<p>If the initial appearance is black, it cannot be treated. If red, it indicates that the water is not yet depleted and is still manageable. However, should toxins persist and lead to necrosis resulting in blackening, urgent amputation is necessary; delaying will worsen the condition, leading to death. This ailment is not contingent on swelling or ulceration, but only effective treatment is through garlic poultice. There are also cases where red sores become painful and self-ulcerate; the vital energy remains intact, making it easier to treat. </p>
<p>Due to the extreme cold beneath the skin, blood and qi have difficulty reaching that area, making the infected flesh prone to decay, while medicinal properties struggle to penetrate. Moreover, the treatments used are often those that attack pain, which may affect the intestines and stomach first, failing to target the poison effectively. Therefore, a garlic poultice combined with amputation is the best method. Thus, Master Sun stated, &quot;If on a finger, cut it off; if on flesh, amputate,&quot; reflecting this principle.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>The condition of gangrene arises from consuming strong alcohol and excessive rich foods, which harm the spleen, or from sexual overexertion that damages the kidneys. Therefore, there are cases where thirst appears first followed by illness, and others where illness manifests before thirst. If the color is red and there is pain with ulceration, it can be treated. If the color is black and there is no ulceration, it should not be treated. In cases of red color and pain, the vital energy is weak and damp toxins are abundant; first, use garlic moxibustion, the Lingming Decoction, and the Tuoli Powder, then follow with the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction and the modified Eight Flavor Pill. If the color is dark and there is no pain, it indicates kidney energy failure and excessive virtual fire; garlic moxibustion and mulberry branch moxibustion should be utilized, along with the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction and the modified Eight Flavor Pill, to prevent the toxic qi from rising and the vital energy from depleting, thereby preserving life. There are cases resulting from injuries such as bites on the hands and feet. If the vital energy is weak, or from sexual activity, applying cold externally and using medicinal herbs internally can harm the spleen and stomach, resulting in non-ulcerated lesions. If the dark area extends upwards, it can often be fatal. In severe cases, one must use a foot knife to cut around the area and gently pull it away; thus, the tendons follow the bones out, allowing the poison to be released without pain. Otherwise, the poisonous tendons may rupture internally, leading to ulcers despite removal.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br><strong>Crane Knee Wind (also known as Drumstick Wind)</strong></p>
<p>The calves and thighs are as thin as reeds, with only the knees appearing large, making movement difficult. Prepare a small life-sustaining decoction with the addition of spiny asparagus, toosendan, angelica, and dried papaya; do not use fresh ginger. Steep the mixture in water, adding a small amount of musk at the bottom of the bowl, strain, and drink. After taking several doses, add Five Accumulations Powder, and continue the decoction until cured.</p>
<p>Crane Knee Wind arises from improper regulation and results in loss of the three yin meridians of the foot. Wind evil invades through deficiency, leading to muscle atrophy, internal heat causing reduced appetite, and limb pain. Over time, this results in swelling of the knees while the legs become thin, resembling a crane&#39;s knee, hence the name. </p>
<p>If the spleen and stomach are injured, use the Central Qi Boosting Decoction as the main remedy; if the liver and kidney are affected, rely on the Six Flavor Pill; if there is a desire for pus or after an abscess, the Complete Nourishment Decoction should be the main remedy, supplemented by a Large Wind-Dispelling Decoction. </p>
<p>At the onset, it is necessary to apply a scallion poultice to promote internal absorption. If there is dryness of the mouth and insufficient central qi, add Schisandra to the Central Qi Boosting Decoction.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>Headaches are due to the yang energy not rising; use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Fructus Viticis added. If there is fever in the afternoon and weakness of yin and blood, use Si Wu Tang with Ginseng, Astragalus, and Atractylodes. If there is aversion to cold, it indicates weak yang energy; use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If there is a lack of appetite and thought, with a feeling of distension in the chest, it suggests a weak spleen and stomach; use Si Jun Zi Tang. If the complexion is pale and yellow, with a lack of appetite and thought, indicating a weak spleen and stomach; use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If there is thin, clear pus, and the muscles do not grow, indicating deficiency of both qi and blood; use Ba Zhen Tang. If there are intermittent fevers with no root cause, indicating empty heat; use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang. If the body is thin, with a tendency to sleep, fever during rest, excess phlegm causing thirst, and frequent urination, indicating damage to the five organs; use Liu Wei Wan. If there is abdominal pain, frequent urination at night, weakness in the legs and knees, and phlegm vomiting from the head, indicating kidney qi deficiency; use Ba Wei Wan. If there is great thirst with an aversion to close clothing, red face, and empty pulse, indicating blood deficiency causing agitation; use Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang. If there are patients with post-dysentery symptoms, treat with the above methods as well.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>I will approach the diagnosis according to the situation. Generally, although this condition may present with varying degrees of swelling and severity, all instances arise from a deficiency of true qi, allowing the pathogenic influence to deeply invade. Therefore, conditions like bone sores and &quot;crane knee wind,&quot; are often seen in those with kidney deficiency. Ancients used aconite to warm and tonify kidney qi, while also facilitating the dispersal of cold evils. There are also individuals with weak constitutions who, sleeping in the open during summer and autumn, are attacked by cold air, leading to accumulation of cold and heat, which often results in this condition, causing inability to move, occasional heat without sweating, and pain upon pressure that radiates to the bones. If this does not resolve over time, extreme yin generates yang, cold transforms into heat, and leads to pus formation. If one is struck by a wind that is not particularly hot but results in chills and occasional sweating, applying heat may alleviate the pain slightly. In such cases, one must urgently treat with formulas like &quot;Wind-dispelling Decoction&quot; or &quot;Fire Dragon Ointment.&quot; There are also cases of contraction and atrophy, with hardness like stone, referred to as stone sore; if the condition lingers without resolution, with red-purple color and decay of flesh, it is known as gradual sore. From beginning to end, it is advisable to take the outward-dispersing decoction to drive away the cold evil and support the deficient condition.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>The principle of establishing the proper treatment has its own suitability. When the body is weak and the evil binds the bones, obstructing the channels, unless one uses warm herbs like Aconite to dispel the cold evil in the joints and open the pathways of qi and blood, recovery is impossible. Moreover, the &quot;Materia Medica&quot; states that Aconite treats cold-dampness, weakness, contractions, knee pain, and inability to walk, and when combined with Atractylodes, it becomes a sacred remedy for cold-dampness. It also mentions that cinnamon opens the blood channels, resolves stagnation, strengthens the bones and joints, and treats wind-damp conditions and weakness of the feet. </p>
<p>When using various prescriptions and the Comprehensive Tonifying Decoction for the aforementioned conditions, it is not only inappropriate to exclude cinnamon but also to not include Aconite. Without these two, how can the effects of ginseng and astragalus, or the properties of angelica and hawthorn, assist in nourishing blood and qi, ensuring the channels are unobstructed, and supporting substantial deficiencies to achieve desired therapeutic results? Furthermore, since the ailments are located between the joints and in key areas, delaying treatment leads to stagnation of qi and blood, resulting in pus formation which, once discharged, leaves the body devoid of any nourishing principle.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p>
<h3>Ulcer</h3>
<p>Ulcers arise on both lower legs. Initially, they appear red and swollen, and over time may become necrotic, or lead to itching and oozing pus. This is due to dietary habits and lifestyle depleting the liver and kidneys, or due to Yin fire flowing downwards and external pathogens clashing. External ulcers are associated with damp-heat in the yang channels of the foot and can be treated; internal ulcers correspond to deficiency-heat in the yin channels of the foot and are harder to cure. </p>
<p>If initial symptoms include chills, high fever, and painful swelling, this indicates damp-heat, and the prescription should be Ping Su Bai Du San. If there is diffuse swelling and pain, or no swelling and pain, this indicates yin deficiency, for which the remedy is Ba Zhen Tang to tonify yin. If there is purulent oozing, bodily fatigue, and poor appetite, with internal heat and dry mouth, this indicates spleen deficiency, and the treatment is to use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with add-ins of Fu Ling and wine-fried Bai Shao. If there is afternoon heat, potential pain, and unclear head, this indicates yin fire; the prescription should be the above formula with the additions of wine-fried Huang Bai and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>If fever occurs in the afternoon and subsides only at midnight, this indicates blood deficiency, and the treatment should add Chuan Xiong, Gui, and Shu Di to the previous formula. If there is severe depression damaging the spleen, use Gui Pi Tang with additions of Chai Hu and Shan Zhi. If anger has stirred up liver fire greatly, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with additional Chuan Xiong, Shan Zhi, and Huang Qin. For internal heat and dry mouth, bodily fatigue, possibly with phlegm rising or sores on the mouth and tongue, this signifies spleen deficiency heat, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. </p>
<p>If the affected area is dark, limbs are sensitive to cold, and there is little desire for food, this points to spleen and kidney deficiency, for which Ba Wei Wan is appropriate. If one aggressively attacks with treatment, it further damages stomach qi, severing its source of transformation, making treatment very difficult. </p>
<h3>Heel Ulcer<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></h3>
<p>The heel is the origin of the Governing Vessel and the area through which the Kidney Meridian passes. If there are disturbances in diet and daily routine, leading to a deficiency in the three Yang Meridians of the foot, ulcers will form. If there is swelling with cold and heat, or if the body feels weary with little appetite, this indicates a deficiency in the Spleen and a sinking condition, which can be treated with the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction.&quot; If there is an evening fever with pain and a lack of clarity in the head and eyes, this indicates deficiency in the Spleen with rising Yin fire, for which the above decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Wan can be used. If phlegm rises, or if sores appear in the mouth and on the tongue, this indicates the drying up of Kidney water, which can be treated with the above decoction plus a modified version of the Eight Treasure Pill. In all these cases, one must nourish the source of transformation; merely treating the exterior will not suffice. It is commonly said that a wound caused by a rabbit&#39;s bite results from a hunter being bitten on the heel, leading to prolonged neglect, depletion of Qi and Blood, and ultimately death.</p>
<p>As for the condition of foot hair, it relates to the deficiency of essence and blood in the three Yin Meridians of the foot, or the downward attack of damp-heat in the three Yang Meridians. If it is red, swollen, painful, and has suppurative discharge, this is treatable and indicates moist heat descending. If it appears slightly red and swollen with clear pus, this indicates a deficiency of essence and blood, which is harder to treat. If the area is dark and does not swell or hurt, and if there is thirst with frequent, painful urination, this indicates a failure of Yin and is untreatable. For those with damp heat descending, one should initially use garlic moxibustion and the &quot;Huo Ming Yin&quot; to clear the obstruction of toxins, then administer the beneficial Qi decoction and Liuwei Wan to replenish essence and Qi. If the condition appears dark but not painful, one should employ meat moxibustion on the mulberry branches to move the obstruction and support Yang Qi; additionally, one should use the &quot;Shiquan Dabu Decoction&quot; and the Eight Treasure Pill to strengthen the Spleen and Stomach, nourishing the source of transformation, which often leads to regeneration. However, focusing solely on treating the ulcer might harm the original Qi, and I have not seen any successful recoveries from that approach.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br><strong>Verification and Treatment Principles</strong>  【Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>Bilharzia</strong></p>
<p>According to Dongyuan&#39;s discussion on southern bilharzia, it is caused by external exposure to dampness and should be treated as a cold condition; whereas, in northern bilharzia, it results from internal damage due to wine and milk, thus treated as a damp-heat condition. This is something that earlier scholars did not clarify, and later scholars became entrenched in it, leading to the formation of two factions in the south and north, mutually criticizing each other. Southerners criticize the northerners, saying: &quot;What they discuss is a northern disease, and their treatment is a northern method, which cannot be applied to the south.&quot; Northerners criticize the southerners, saying: &quot;What they discuss is a southern disease, and their treatment is a southern method, which cannot be applied to the north.&quot; Alas! At the beginning of such arguments, they do not delve into what is stated in the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; from start to finish, but create their own names, causing future generations who adhere to these ideas to know only one aspect while being ignorant of the other, leading to such mutual disagreement.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>The texts &quot;Su&quot; and &quot;Ling,&quot; among others, explore the heavens above and the earth below, examining human affairs and their changes. The essence of the cosmos is nourished by the dual energies of heaven and earth, while humans offer reverence through the Six Classics, the Three Yin, and the Three Yang. Thus, the Three Yin and Three Yang correspond to the energies within human Six Classics. They nourish the organs and strengthen the spirit, facilitating the transformation of food and water into the sustenance of the body.</p>
<p>When the six energies of heaven and earth are improperly aligned, change occurs, leading to disturbances in the body&#39;s form, manifesting as illnesses referred to as external pathogens. Likewise, if a person’s Three Yin and Three Yang are out of balance, alterations may lead to conditions characterized by inappropriate fluids, identified as internal pathogens. Both situations can result in a myriad of illnesses throughout the body.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Six Classics of the feet originate from the five toes. Movement through the legs and knees is linked to the internal organs and governs the circulation of energy and blood below the body’s midpoint. Consequently, if external pathogens enter, they can obstruct the flow of these energies and block the circulation of blood.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>If one has an internal stagnation of pathogenic elements that becomes lodged, it is surely similar to the obstruction of qi and blood by external pathogens. The symptoms of congestion, pain, weakness, numbness, and counterflow are also alike. Hence, this condition is commonly referred to as &quot;foot qi,&quot; which is recognized across all regions. </p>
<p>Now, in the southern regions, there is an acknowledgment of the dampness from external pathogens, while the northern regions address the internal dampness from within. Is this not a misunderstanding? However, even if the northern regions lack the low-lying dampness of the earth, they are subject to moisture from rain and dew, as well as from sweat and footwear. All these contribute to dampness. When shoes are removed, and sweat combines with the wind, leading to blood coagulating in the feet, can this not be classified similarly to the external dampness of the southern regions?</p>
<p>Although the southern regions may not have the milk-like dampness, they do have moisture from food and drink that injures the organs and causes the accumulation of fluids. Does this not relate to the internal stagnation seen in the milk-like dampness of the northern regions? Understanding this principle is critical, yet one might fear the difficulty in discerning different pathogenic influences, leaving little time to cause harm to one another!</p>
<p>Those afflicted with foot qi from the Sun meridian will experience headaches, dizziness, a stiff neck, and pain radiating through the lower back, along the body’s channels, and extending from the outer ankle following the bone to the outer side of the little toe.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>It is advisable to adapt to the seasonal climate and disperse the illness with Mahuang Zuo Jing Decoction. </p>

It is appropriate to adapt to the seasonal climate and use Dahuang Zuo Jing Decoction.</p>
<p>For Shaoyang channel&#39;s foot disease, there is bitterness in the mouth, shortness of breath, pain in the ribs, a dull complexion, lack of luster, and pain in the head and eyes. The area around the lower abdomen and under the armpits is swollen like a horse&#39;s knife, with spontaneous sweating and chills, fever, pain in the chest and ribs, hips, knees, outer areas down to the ankle, and in various joints and fingers. It is advisable to adapt to the seasonal climate and harmonize with Banxia Zuo Jing Decoction.</p>
<p>For the simultaneous occurrence of three Yang channels&#39; foot disease, there is a dislike of cold and intense heat, spontaneous sweating and aversion to wind, or no sweating with aversion to cold, dizziness, heavy sensation, joint pains, stiff hands and feet, cold pain, and weakness in the waist and legs, uncoordinated movements, restlessness, upward qi flow, vomiting, and diarrhea. The pulse is bound and tight, rapid in number; it is advisable to use Daliao Shenmi Zuo Jing Decoction and a modified Bailu San.</p>
<p>For Taiyin channel&#39;s foot disease, there is abdominal fullness, urgency in the throat connecting to the tongue, oppression in the chest, and fullness in the diaphragm. There is pain circling from the shin bone down to the inner front of the thigh and knee, and along the inner ankle, extending to the inner side of the big toe. It is appropriate to use Liuwu Fuzhi Decoction.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>For patients with foot swelling from the Lesser Yin channel, there is pain in the lower back and spine, radiating from beneath the little toe through the soles of the feet, along the inner ankle, entering the middle of the heel, passing through the inner side of the popliteal fossa, affecting the flesh of the thigh, all of which experience pain. This condition can surge upwards to the chest and throat, causing hunger but inability to eat, a darkened complexion, painful and blocked urination, incessant coughing and spitting, feelings of fear, and a heart that feels jumpy as if someone is about to catch it. If the lower abdomen is numb, treatment is difficult. The four seasonal energies should be assessed for their severity, and warming treatment is advised, such as taking the Eight Flavor Pill.</p>
<p>For patients with foot swelling from the Supreme Yin channel, there is unilateral pain in the waist and ribs, extending from the big toe through the upper foot and thigh, reaching the inner side of the thigh, encircling the groin and affecting the lower abdomen and areas around the navel with distending pain. The legs may also cramp painfully, along with dry throat and reverse vomiting, leading to diarrhea. Treatment should be adjusted according to the severity of the condition influenced by the four seasonal energies, advised to take the Shen Ying Nourishing True Elixir.</p>
<p>For patients with concurrent conditions affecting all three Yin channels, there is rigidity in the limbs, shortness of breath, and fullness of the chest. There may be constipation or difficult urination, a feeling of heart heat and restlessness, generalized swelling of the body, weakness of the knees and feet, making it difficult to walk. It is advisable to take the Pursue Toxic Decoction.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>The above text discusses the influences of the six classical medical texts, explaining how wind, cold, heat, and dampness affect the body.

Heat-related agitation signifies heat dominance, and swelling signifies dampness dominance. Each condition should be treated according to the prevailing influence without being confined to a single approach.</p>
<p>When damp-heat causes illness, symptoms include painful joints, a heavy feeling in the shoulders and back, discomfort in the chest, widespread pain, and intolerable swelling in the legs and feet. In such cases, the prescription &quot;Danggui Nian Tong Tang&quot; is recommended. The texts state that certain herbs can clear obstruction and promote fluid movement. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions that when dampness predominates, it should be treated with bitter and warming remedies. Qianghuo, with its bitter and acrid properties, unblocks joints and counters dampness, while Fangfeng, being sweet and acrid, disperses dampness in the meridians. The moist nature of water-based herbs facilitates downward movement, and herbs like Shengma and Gegeng, which are mildly bitter and acrid, help initiate upward movement through their subtle flavors, utilizing bitterness to promote healing.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>Atractylodes is bitter, sweet, and warm; it balances and eliminates dampness. Cangzhu is light and buoyant, with strong energy, capable of removing dampness from the skin&#39;s pores, which is why it is used as a subordinate herb. When blood stagnates and does not flow, it leads to pain; therefore, angelica, being acrid and warm, disperses it, allowing blood and energy to return to their proper places. Ginseng and licorice are sweet and warm, nourishing the spleen and supporting upright qi, preventing bitter herbs from harming the spleen and stomach. Zhang Zhongjing stated that when damp heat combines, it causes pain in the joints. Bitter herbs like kushen, huangqin, zhimu, and yinchen are cold and bitter, used to drain dampness. For the treatment of inadequate urination due to dampness, the typical method is not sufficient. Polyporus is sweet, warm, and balanced, while ze xie is salty and mild, helping to drain excess fluids and guiding stagnant fluid out, which is why they are used as assistants. The harmonious combination of flavors facilitates the splitting and draining of dampness, allowing the stagnant energy to circulate freely. </p>
<p>Three-Yin and Ten Complete Pill, Xu Duan Pills, Job’s Tears Wine, and Tiger Bone Wine all possess gentle and balanced medicinal properties, suitable for patients who are deficient without excess accumulation and can be taken regularly.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>When there is rigidity in the limbs due to a cold, it refers to the difficulty in bending and stretching them. Regardless of which meridian relates to the ailment, whenever this symptom is present, it results from yin and cold, as cold tends to contract and constrict. According to Zhong Jing’s methods, even when there are superficial symptoms of the Taiyang stage and wind-dampness causing contraction, treatments like Guizhi Jia Fuzi Decoction or Gancao Fuzi Decoction should be administered. How much more should this apply to conditions affecting the yin meridians, manifestations of cholera, and the usage of Sini Decoction? Generally, when a patient with severe cold has sweated profusely and then is exposed to the wind, the sweat ceases to circulate, allowing the wind pathogen to invade the meridians, leading to spasms and an inability to bend or stretch the limbs due to tightness in the tendons and vessels. In such cases, it is appropriate to use Burdock Root Powder as the remedy.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br><strong>Abscess</strong></p>
<p>An abscess occurs between the joints of the fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Tiger&#39;s Mouth Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The abscess at the tiger&#39;s mouth arises in the He Gu point.</p>
<p><strong>Snake Head Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The snake head abscess appears on both sides of the fingertip, resembling a snake&#39;s head, with a strong foul odor, dark purple color, and pain radiating to the heart, sometimes leading to ulceration and detachment.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Boil</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Gui Yi,&quot; when an arm droops, lesions appear near the bone on the lower arm, growing to the size of chicken or duck eggs, caused by disturbed nourishment and defense. It tends to remain solid but does not penetrate deeply; thus, it should be urgently resolved, or treated quickly at the site of onset. In both arms, sores appear below the elbow and above the small bone. Despite being solid, these can connect various tendons and muscles, leading to difficulty in movement, with pain in the drooping hand and a deep, penetrating pus that harms tendons and blood vessels, resulting in contracted fists and spasms. It is essential to treat with slow-acting tendon and vein remedies.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Yuan Ji,&quot; an abscess on the outer arm is a boil, on the inner arm indicative of a fish belly issue, and swelling around the joints implies arm wind toxin. It is advisable to take a life-saving decoction adding Qiang Huo, Du Huo, Gui Zhi, and Jie Geng, boiled with equal parts water and wine, as well as selecting from various elixirs like Du Ming Dan, Zi Jin Dan, and Sheng Jin Dan. For those robust with internal evidence, one pill of Jin Dan or Ba Zhen San should be given. If there is swelling without a head that resists detoxifying medicine, it is advisable to use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding Gui Zhi and Jie Geng to support it. If there is vomiting and no food intake for several days, the discharge of pus will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br><strong>Numbness and Boils (Commonly known as Disease of the Lotus Bundle)</strong></p>
<p>The arm, both inside and out, is swollen, painful, and red, except at the elbow joint, which is slightly smaller; hence it is called the lotus bundle, representing the division of yin and yang. Someone might ask about the Yangming meridian of the arm: it initially resembles millet, gradually grows to the size of a red bean, and becomes unbearably painful. Within ten days, it can swell to the size of a walnut and turn a withered purple color. What does this signify? It is called bone fistula sores. If the poison spreads throughout the body, causing rigidity, convulsions, vomiting, inability to eat, spontaneous cold sweat, diarrhea, irritability, and chaotic pulse, the person will die. Those who are influenced by excessive fatigue or anger will also die. </p>
<p>One person suffering from this condition, after a month, developed widespread lesions, vomited yellow fluid, filled the room with foul odors, and subsequently vomited pus and blood, leading to death within ten days. This individual had been eating and drinking just three or four days earlier; family members helped him wash and stand, but his skin and flesh had already rotted. The patient was in disbelief, and the doctors were unable to recognize the condition, leading to the demise. This is caused by the imbalance of emotions, accumulated anger, accumulated worries, and excessive heat, resulting in a depletion of true essence that cannot withstand the evil. Even with pills and elixirs, it is ultimately determined by fate. Only the wise can prevent disasters before they occur, urgently taking medicine such as Huanglian Xiaodu San, Shengjin Dan, Wujin San, and Huoming Yin with selected Qianghuo. Treating it hastily can lead to dire consequences; if there are multiple severe symptoms, death is certain. </p>
<p>This condition arises suddenly and leads to rapid death, indicating extreme yin deficiency and uncontrolled fire. Therefore, previous medicines do not nourish the source and merely stop the boiling; can this truly help?<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br><strong>Palm Poison</strong></p>
<p>Palm poison causes redness, swelling, and pain in the palm, commonly known as &quot;disease of the palm,&quot; also referred to as &quot;piercing cave celestial snake&quot; and &quot;poor child bowl.&quot; If it is located towards the palm&#39;s edge, it is called &quot;piercing edge celestial snake&quot; or &quot;piercing ridge celestial snake.&quot; This condition arises from accumulated heat in the hand&#39;s jueyin heart protector. Initially, it is advisable to use garlic moxibustion to release the poison and to take a life-saving drink with cinnamon twig and turmeric. For those with sufficient vitality, taking herbal decoctions will help with sweating. For treatment, select from Zijing Dan, Duoming Dan, Wujin San, or Yipin Jin Dan. Once the condition has broken, use large doses of ginseng and astragalus to replenish.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br><strong>Tiger Mouth Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>A carbuncle forming at the tiger mouth, characterized by redness, swelling, and pain, is known as &quot;He Gu Ju,&quot; also referred to as &quot;Ya Ci Du,&quot; &quot;Bo Xie Du,&quot; and &quot;Shou Cha Fa.&quot; It arises from the accumulation of wind, heat, and toxins in the Yangming Large Intestine meridian. Initially, it is advisable to apply a garlic moxibustion treatment, and to consume a restorative drink with added cinnamon twig, turmeric, platycodon root, and cimicifuga, boiled in water or wine. For robust individuals, the dosage can be adjusted for perspiration and purging. For the elderly and weak, select formulas from &quot;Shi Quan Da Bu Tang,&quot; &quot;Shi Xuan San,&quot; or &quot;Tuo Li San.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Crow’s Claw</strong></p>
<p>A toxin forming at the junction of the five fingers, commonly known as &quot;Crow&#39;s Claw.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Wrist Abscess</strong></p>
<p>When a toxin manifests as redness and swelling at the flexion of the hand, it is referred to as a hand flexion abscess or &quot;Shou Niu Ya Qiao.&quot; This results from the accumulation of wind and heat toxins in the three Yin meridians. The treatment approach is similar to that mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Dorsum (Commonly Known as Spider Back)</strong></p>
<p>The text &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: When both hands develop abscesses resembling water blisters, without any heads initially, and later become swollen with toxins forming sores that penetrate to the bone, this condition is called a hand dorsum, belonging to the category of five types of toxins. Hand dorsum swellings are due to stagnation of wind and heat in the three Yang meridians. A restorative drink with added scutellaria, lamium, gardenia, platycodon root, and cimicifuga should be taken; add cinnamon twig for cold symptoms and turmeric for heat. For those with surface symptoms, use Zijing Dan, Wujin San, or Duoming Dan for sweating. For internal symptoms, a single golden pill or Bazhen San should be used. The elderly and weak should use strong restorative formulas.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br><strong>Big Thumb Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>A small spot appears on the big thumb resembling a grain, gradually enlarging to the size of a bean, or shaped like a peach or plum, sometimes blue, sometimes purple, intermittently yellow, black, or white. It may be itchy or numb without pain, or can cause intense heart-wrenching pain; this is called &quot;regulating carbuncle&quot; and is associated with the hand Taiyin lung meridian accumulating toxins. If the toxins are severe, amputation is advised. If blood and pus are drawn after four days, the person will survive; if black blood is drawn, they will die. Urgently take Wujin powder or Zijing pill to induce sweating. For robust individuals, administer one gold pill. If toxic qi attacks the heart, leading to vomiting and an inability to eat, the person will die if swollen. If there is bleeding from the gums, the person will die.</p>
<p><strong>Heavenly Snake Head</strong></p>
<p>If there is toxicity around the middle finger, with redness, swelling, and pain, or it occurs in any finger, it is all referred to as &quot;Heavenly Snake Head.&quot; If there is pus that bursts open and the lips resemble the shape of a snake&#39;s head, it is named thus. This is caused by accumulated heat in the hand Jueyin pericardium. It is advisable to take the Lifesaving Decoction with additions of Chaihu, Qianghuo, Jiegeng, and Huanglian, as well as options like Disinfecting Decoction, Zijing pill, and Wujin powder. Even if black, stubborn, and numb, leading to finger loss, the person still does not die.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br><strong>Dun Ju</strong></p>
<p>Dun Ju refers to sores that appear on the fingertips, caused by accumulated heat in the internal organs. The treatment must not be delayed; it is advisable to take herbal remedies such as Huang Lian Decoction, Zi Jin Dan, Wu Jin San, or a single pill of Jin Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Finger Joint Inflammation</strong></p>
<p>Inflammation at the finger joints manifests as toxic swellings that are red, swollen, and painful. It is also known as &quot;disease callus,&quot; &quot;snake joint boil,&quot; &quot;deng-jie tian she,&quot; or &quot;disease snake joint.&quot; The treatment method is similar to that for the snake head.</p>
<p><strong>Dai Zhi</strong></p>
<p>Dai Zhi begins with swelling, pain, and heat, presenting a non-dark color. Pus accumulates around the nail edges, and in severe cases, the nails may all fall off. It is best to apply a cold medicinal liquid to the affected area. The nails are the remnants of tendons; tendons rely on the nourishment of blood, and if the blood is overheated, it concentrates at the fingertip, causing swelling and accumulation of pus, resulting in nail loss. This condition resembles finger boils but lacks toxic accumulation, hence the color is not dark and, even if prolonged, is not lethal. </p>
<p>For internal treatment, the &quot;Sheng Ji Zong Lu&quot; contains formulas like Lou Lu Decoction and Lan Hua Decoction, which include Lou Lu, Lan Hua, Sheng Ma, Da Huang, Huang Qin, Yuan Shen, and (Shi Bu) Xie. Since there is no toxic accumulation, why use Xie and Huang as medicine? Treating a mild condition as if it were severe—can this be justified? Therefore, these remedies are not recommended today.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br><strong>Gangrene of the Groin [See also Bone Abscess]</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ghost Inheritance&quot; states: Gangrene of the groin occurs at the thigh and genital region, initially presenting with lumbar stiffness, inability to drink much due to discomfort, and after seven days becomes hard and swollen, with severe pain and restlessness, leading to death if untreated. </p>
<p>If one asks about the formation of poison within the large thigh, beside the scrotum, the response is: It is called &quot;Upper Horse Abscess&quot; on the left, &quot;Lower Horse Abscess&quot; on the right, and &quot;Anal Abscess&quot; near the anus. All are attributed to damp heat in the Foot Taiyang channel, disharmony of emotions, and causes such as anxiety and anger. </p>
<p>It is advisable to take the Inner Supplement Decoction of Astragalus, the Inner Deliverance Decoction of Qinghao, and the Complete Great Tonifying Decoction, selecting from Shengjindan or Zijingdan. For robust individuals, one should take a Golden Pill and administer Bazhen Powder. </p>
<p>If one experiences vomiting, loss of appetite, numbness and dark indents, swelling, weak or intermittent pulse, persistent cold sweat, anxiety, mania, insufficient urination, and diarrhea, they shall not be treated. When there is suppuration, it is best to first take the Taige Ziweidan. </p>
<p>Note that the pulsations of the Three Yang channels are external, referred to as the thigh; the pulsations of the Three Yin channels are internal, referred to as the groin. Now, when it is stated that within the larger thigh, beside the scrotum, it pertains to the Three Yin channels while Yueshu is especially pronounced, calling it Foot Taiyang is indeed erroneous.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Fang Yang Ju (Abscess on the Leg)</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about an abscess that appears five to six inches below the outer side of the leg. The answer: This is known as &quot;hidden rabbit onset.&quot; Cold and heat surge dramatically, causing deep pain and swelling without a head. It belongs to the Yangming stomach channel of the foot. Ancient sages regarded it as a symptom that is difficult to treat; early detection and treatment are paramount. Apply garlic moxibustion urgently. If blisters arise from moxibustion, it can be treated; if no blisters appear, treatment is difficult. Administer “Lifegiving Decoction” with added cow knee, papaya, and Han Fang Ji, alongside Zijing Dan and Shengjin Dan to induce sweating. For those in good health, administer Bazhen San and one pill of Jindan.</p>
<p><strong>Leg Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about sudden redness and swelling in the leg. The answer: This is known as leg rheumatism, caused by the clash of wind and heat. It belongs to the Taiyang channel of the foot. It is advisable to use a needle to extract the bad blood, and administer Fangfeng Tongseng San, replacing Bai Zhu with Huangbo and adding cow knee and Fang Ji.</p>
<p><strong>Weizhong Poison</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about a fourteen-year-old girl experiencing alternating chills and fever, with a firm, slightly red, and swollen area behind the knee joint. The answer: This is known as Weizhong poison, located in the crease behind the knee. It belongs to the Taiyang channel, caused by accumulated heat in the organs flowing into the bladder. Use Bazhen San to eliminate about a dou of stagnant blood. If treatment is delayed, it may result in ulceration and muscle contraction, leading to chronic disability.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a></p>
<h3>Crane Knee Wind</h3>
<p>Someone asked about swollen and painful knees and the gradual thinning of the thighs. The answer: This is called Crane Knee Wind, also known as Hammer Wind. It arises from internal dampness, or may occur after diarrhea when the legs are weak and painful, making it difficult to walk, termed Diarrhea Wind. It may also result from the residual toxins of a cold, failing to disperse, causing wind, cold, and dampness to obstruct the meridians, leading to stagnant blood flow, which results in muscle contraction and further thinning of the thighs, associated with the Lesser Yang and Yangming meridians of the leg. </p>
<p>It is advisable to use jade dragon ointment mixed with wine and apply it to the legs to alleviate pain and revive yang energy; also, apply a warming ointment to the ankles to promote the movement of qi and blood. Taking the Great Wind Dispelling Decoction or Dispelling Wind Pills, with an increased amount of myrrh, can help relieve pain and relax the muscles. Additionally, moxibustion with garlic is recommended. If it feels as hard as stone, rubbing with raw camphor root is effective.</p>
<p>If asked about pain and swelling on the knees, the response: This is not a simple matter and requires careful distinction. If both knees are swollen and painful, resembling a bite from a tiger, with alternating cold and heat, progressively thinning thighs, and increasingly swollen knees, it is called Crane Knee Wind. Immediate garlic moxibustion and the Great Wind Dispelling Decoction should be administered. </p>
<p>However, if one knee experiences pain that extends above and below, with slight swelling and redness, it is termed Knee Wander Wind, and it is advisable to take the Saintly Gift Pill, Bone Changing Pill, or Wind Dispelling and Open Spirit Powder with added achyranthes and papaya. If there is swelling and pain on both sides of the knee, with aversion to cold and an intense heat sensation, worsening day and night, and the swollen area should not be touched, it is termed Knee Eye Poison; swelling and pain on the knee itself is classified as Knee Abscess. For these two conditions, it is advisable to take Winning Gold Pills, or Purple Gold Pills, Eight Formation Powder, or Life Saving Decoction with added achyranthes.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br><strong>Shin Yin Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about the inner side of the lower leg: slightly red, slightly swollen, hard as stone, about three to four inches in size, and causing unbearable pain. What should be done? It is called the yellow eel abscess, attributed to the damp heat of the foot Taiyin and foot Jueyin meridians, also caused by pent-up anger. One should take Five Spice Decoction and Flowing Qi Drink, adding achyranthes, papaya, fangji, and berberine. For a strong constitution, one should take a gold pill, or the Universal Detoxifying Pill for myriad ailments. For those who are weak, a Complete Qi and Blood Nourishing Decoction with added achyranthes and papaya. If it becomes overripe and oozes clear liquid, with rising yang fire leading to vomiting and inability to eat, it should not be treated.</p>
<p><strong>Sanli Fa</strong></p>
<p>The text &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: In the Sanli area, two places can develop abscesses. Initially, they appear like a cow&#39;s eye, bluish-black. Within five to seven days, they break open, releasing dark blood and pus. This causes swelling and pain in the calf, along with cold, tight discomfort in the leg. This results from straining the muscles and qi due to overexertion. One should use decoctions and injections externally; the toxins will dissipate by themselves.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br><strong>Fracture of the Bones</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: At the area where the bones of the two feet connect, slightly above the calf, there will appear a sore the size of a walnut, hard and resembling a bump from a blow. It does not cause sharp pain, but it swells rapidly. There is concern about damage to the tendons, thus it is essential to expel the pus and toxins early to ensure safety.</p>
<p><strong>Green Snake Bowel Movement</strong></p>
<p>If asked about a lump below the calf, about two or three inches long, accompanied by great cold and heat, and inability to eat or drink, what should be done? It is called &quot;Green Snake Troubling.&quot; It relates to the Kidney Yin and the Foot Yangming meridians, resulting from deficiency of the Kidney causing damp heat to descend. If the head of the lump is pointed upwards, it is difficult to treat. If the head points downwards, one should extract the bad blood, and take medicinal drinks with papaya, cowherb, yellow bile, or selections of black gold powder and purple gold pill. For the old and weak, if they experience vomiting, abdominal distension, confusion, and rapid pulse, the outcome is fatal. </p>
<p>The &quot;Green Snake&quot; condition develops on the upper and lower parts of the calves; if the head points upwards and breaks into the abdomen, it cannot be treated. If the head points downwards and the tail is upwards, it is considered treatable. Urgent administration of a compound of twenty-six ingredients known as Tuo Li San is required, along with external application of the medicinal formula Shen Fang Tie Gu San, mixed with ginger juice, aged vinegar, and pig bile for dressing. For upward-facing conditions, use a three-edged needle on the snake&#39;s head, inserting it two inches to draw out dark purple blood. After removing the needle, immediately use Baosheng San, soaking a paper wick in the medicine and inserting it.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br><strong>Gourd Vine Entanglement</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about several kernels appearing on the foot and causing swelling and persistent pain that eventually becomes ulcerated. What should be done? It is called &quot;Gourd Vine Entanglement,&quot; related to the Foot Taiyang Meridian, resulting from damp heat in the internal organs flowing downwards. Use Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder with Areca Nut, Niu Xi, and Fangji.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Ankle Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about a carbuncle on the inner ankle. What should be done? It is called &quot;Shoe Lacing Boil,&quot; arising from cold and damp stagnation in the Foot Yangming and Foot Jueyin Liver Meridians, due to blood stagnation and qi blockage. Initially, it is advisable to apply garlic moxibustion; take Qi Flowing Drink with Niu Xi, Momordica, and Fangji. For robust individuals, one Golden Pill should be taken. For the elderly and weak, use Shiquan Dabu Decoction or Neito Huangqi Chaihu Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>External Ankle Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about a carbuncle on the outer ankle. What should be done? It is called &quot;Foot Turning Poison,&quot; pertaining to the Shaoyang Gall Bladder Meridian and Foot Taiyang Bladder Meridian with damp heat descending. It is advisable to take Neito Qianghuo Decoction, Huanglian Disinfecting Powder, or choose Neito Fujiang Powder. Any of the Sheng Jin Dan, Wu Jin Dan, or Zi Jin Dan can be used.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br><strong>Fèi Tán Fā</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: If someone has a small pimple on their feet and abdomen, with cold and heat causing agitation, what should be done? It is said: This is called Fèi Tán Fā, belonging to the foot’s Shaoyin kidney meridian, caused by insufficient kidney water leading to heat accumulation. Ancient medical texts say it should not be treated. It is advisable to use Lifesaving Decoction with Achyranthes bidentata, papaya, and Coptis chinensis. For the elderly and weak, add Achyranthes bidentata to Ba Zhen Decoction. For robust individuals, a single pill of Golden Elixir should be taken. Those in a weakened state may find it difficult to treat; they should administer Kidney Qi Pill and Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. If it discharges blood and pus, recovery is possible; if it discharges clear fluid, it is fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Lián Chuāng</strong></p>
<p>The text &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: Beneath the two curves of the calf (in autumn), in front of the inner and outer ankles, there are sharp edges on both sides, leading to internal and external convergence. It binds into a swollen lump; this area is close to the bone and hard to heal. It is advisable to use Detox Powder externally applied around, and at the center, use blood-activating medicinal paste, which is harmless. </p>
<p>Someone asked: If there are sores at the inner and outer ankles that have persisted for years, what should be done? It is said: This arises from damp heat descending, stagnating blood in the meridians, causing the muscle to turn purplish black, with intermittent itching and pain. For women, this condition is called &quot;skirt wind pants mouth sore,&quot; also known as Lián Chuāng, which is particularly difficult to treat. It is due to the dampness caused by the skirt fan on the ground. It is advisable to take Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction, Fang Feng Tong Sheng Powder with Achyranthes bidentata, papaya, and Stephania tetrandra, and apply a paper barrier plaster externally, or use a paste made from Ligustrum lucidum leaves.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br><strong>Feng Ju (Wind Abscess)</strong></p>
<p>When there is itchiness in the feet and knees, scratching causes yellow fluid to emerge, which is called Feng Ju. It should be treated with the Feng Ju formula.</p>
<p><strong>Tuo Ju (Detached Abscess)</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: When swelling appears on both toes, if it does not reduce after five days, it disperses. If it festers for four days, it can be punctured. If there is black pus, it is severe; if it hasn’t surpassed the period, it can be treated. When a sore grows on the toes, if it is severe, it festers and detaches, hence it is called Tuo Ju. Some say only the big toe suffers from Tuo Ju; other toes with similar issues are called Dun Ju, which is easier to treat. Only Tuo Ju is difficult to treat. When it first appears as a red, swollen, painful toxin, use Wu Shen San and apply crushed Zihua Che, Jin Xian Diao Hu Lu, Jin Ji She, and Jin Nao Xiang; also apply juice. Additionally, use Wan Bing Jie Du Wan, ground with vinegar and applied warm. For lingering pain, eliminate dampness and attack the toxin, further moxibusting with isolated garlic until there is no pain, and using the Twelve Meridians Disinfecting Powder combined with guiding herbs.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>If the swelling is severe and urgent treatment has not been obtained, one should treat it as a snake bite or a reaction to miasma, and effectiveness is expected. If the pain has not yet fully developed, and it is either absent or severe, one should use garlic moxibustion and detoxify with methods like the Xian Du Wan, adjusting according to the situation. </p>
<p>If it appears dark and not fully formed, it should be cut away immediately, and one should take restorative tonics to hopefully save the patient. However, if the blackness extends upward, it cannot be treated. </p>
<p>If the pain is severe and it appears red, one should apply detoxifying treatment, combined with moxibustion, using the Ren Shen Bai Du San mixed with Jie Geng, adding Chi Niu Xi, Yin Hua, Bai Zhi, and Da Huang to alleviate the pain; follow up with the Shi Xuan San combined with Tian Hua Fen, Jin Yin Hua, and Chi Niu Xi. </p>
<p>If it&#39;s not fully developed but is turning purple and there is no pain, one should apply garlic moxibustion fifty times; if pain is still unknown, follow up with moxibustion and take the Huolu Ming drink, then use the Tuo Li San to dissolve it for recovery. </p>
<p>If it is not fully developed but severely painful and swollen with a red color, one should apply garlic moxibustion until the pain stops, using a modified version of the Jing Jie Bai Du San with Chi Niu Xi, Yin Hua, Bai Zhi, and Da Huang, and then follow with the Huolu Ming drink.</p>
<p>Foot Qi Ulcer</p>
<p>The kidney governs the feet. When the kidney is deficient and affected by wind and dampness, attacking the feet and knees, this condition is called &quot;Foot Qi.&quot; Due to the stagnation of qi and blood, and the excess of damp toxic qi in the skin surface, it cannot circulate properly, causing ulcers to form on the feet. If the wind and toxins do not disperse, the ulcers gradually increase with yellow fluid, swelling and pain ensue, and the body develops a high fever, making it difficult to heal for a long time.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br><strong>Jia Ju [Nail Disease]</strong></p>
<p>The three Yin meridians of the foot all originate at the toes. When the Qi and blood stagnate and do not flow, they can accumulate between the nails, leading to nail disease. This is due to the flow of the meridians and is not solely a problem of the muscles. It may arise from trimming the nails and injuring the underlying flesh, from nails growing into the flesh, or from improper footwear causing stagnation of Qi and blood, resulting in ulceration. If it persists, it can rot the fingers and extend up to the shins and knees, leading to sores and blisters. Since the disease occurs at the extremities, it is unnecessary to treat the internal organs; one should simply apply ointments to cleanse and remove foulness and fit the footwear properly for recovery. The toes are at the lowest part of the body, making it easy for Qi and blood to stagnate and difficult for medicinal effects to reach; weak individuals may develop sores from minor injuries that do not heal over time. In cases of severe injury, only through substantially tonifying the Qi and blood can recovery be expected. This notion of treating only the extremities is not universally applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Foot Tofu Development</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: Yang sores appear on the ankles and soles; if twenty days pass without improvement, it can be fatal. It may be punctured after ten days. If the sore is red and has white pus with not much blood, it is itchy and if black and red, it is fatal. The &quot;tufu&quot; refers to the top of the foot, where toxins can accumulate leading to swelling and pain; it is also called foot rashes and is connected to the liver channel of the foot Jueyin and the stomach channel of Yangming. It usually results from damp heat penetrating a weakness, and it is advisable to take a restorative drink adding papaya, cinnamon, and cow knee, along with moxibustion on garlic. This can be followed by a tonifying decoction or warming the middle. Thick pus can be treated, but if the pus is clear and purplish, it is fatal.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br><strong>Heel Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks about a carbuncle on the heel, what should be done? It is called &quot;rabbit bite&quot; because its shape resembles that of a rabbit&#39;s bite. It belongs to the Taiyang channel of the foot, with the point named Shenmai, located beneath the heel bone. This area is where the two extremes of yin and yang originate, resulting from accumulated heat in the organs. The toxicity is profound, and the use of toxic medicines externally is most to be avoided. Instead, one should perform moxibustion using garlic, and take the &quot;Reviving Life Decoction&quot; with added ox knee and cinnamon, or select from the &quot;Victory Gold Pill,&quot; &quot;Black Gold Powder,&quot; or &quot;Purple Gold Pill.&quot; If there is purple-black discoloration, numbness, confusion, or irregular pulses, it is not treatable. If it festers over time, it might hinder eating and drinking. Additionally, if the two excretions are unregulated, or if there has been excessive physical exertion or emotional agitation, it can lead to death.</p>
<p>For women experiencing swelling and pain in the heel and toes, along with heat in the soles of the feet, this is due to childbirth and menstruation, lacking appropriate care, leading to deficiency in the three yin of the foot and causing false heat. If there is swelling and pain or pus formation, use the Six Flavor Pill as the main treatment, supplemented with the Eight Treasures Decoction; if there is stomach deficiency and reluctance to eat, supplement with the Six Gentlemen Decoction; for cold and heat with inner heat, supplement with the Xiaoyao Powder; if afternoon heat increases, with unclear head and eyes, supplement with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If phlegm is excessive, causing thirst or sores in the mouth and tongue, also use the previous two medicines to nourish the source of digestion. Generally, symptoms of fever, afternoon heat, internal heat, spontaneous sweating, and night sweating indicate false heat due to yin deficiency. Therefore, Danxi states that fire arises from the nine springs, representing the extreme of yin deficiency. Men who excessively indulge in alcohol and lust are often afflicted by this condition.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br><strong>Liu Li Ju (Glazed Ulcer)</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked about the ulcer beside the heel, how it manifests. It is called Liu Li Ju, belonging to the Taiyang channel of the foot. Its color is yellow and swollen like glaze, often caused by walking on rough paths, injuring the muscles, bones, and vessels internally. When cold and heat arise together, and the vital energy is insufficient, symptoms such as vomiting and dizziness occur, making it difficult to treat. In emergencies, take Five Spice Decoction, Lifesaving Drink, Sheng Jindan (Victory Gold Pill), or Wujin San (Black Gold Powder) as needed. For the robust, one pill of Jindan, or administer Bazhen San (Eight Formation Powder).</p>
<p><strong>Foot Sole Boil</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ghost&#39;s Inheritance&quot; states: If the soles of both feet produce pain that reaches the bone, it is untreatable. If the soles have minor skin breaks without deep damage, and the pus is not abundant, it can be treated. When the soles are swollen and painful due to toxicity, it is also known as Yongquan Ju (Gushing Spring Ulcer), commonly called &quot;disease penetrating the board&quot;, and also referred to as &quot;penetrating the cavernous heavenly snake&quot;. This is caused by the deficiency and damage of the Shaoyin kidney channel, and it is recommended to use garlic for moxibustion. For the robust, take Lifesaving Drink and administer Liuwei Dihuang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill). If there are signs of exterior and interior conditions, measure for sweating and sweating out. For those who are deficient, use Shenqiusan (Decoction of All-around Great Nourishment) and large doses of Bamei Dihuang Wan (Eight Flavor Rehmannia Pill) without concern for morning or night. If there are symptoms of ulceration, nausea, confusion, and weak pulse presenting as a replacement, the prognosis is fatal.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br><strong>Fleshy Callus</strong></p>
<p>A fleshy callus grows between the toes, resembling a hard corn, attached to the flesh, causing hidden pain akin to a thorn, formed due to tight footwear rubbing against it.</p>
<p><strong>Unnamed Tumor and Poison</strong></p>
<p>Swelling on the back of the hand or foot, with red streaks resembling shrimp, is referred to as shrimp disease. Fry fragrant oil with salt and soak in hot soup, then wash with the hot infusion to eliminate. It is also necessary to take medications for sores. Near the folds of the knee, there are painful swellings that appear like elongated fish, known as &quot;Upper Water Fish.&quot; Use a thorn needle to pierce and draw out bad blood, employing the dried ash of the mulberry tree, ingredients from the Lei Ting vine, and leaves of mountain camphor, pounded into a paste, fried, and bound on. Additionally, combine Lei Ting vine, red cow knee, mountain santalum, and dried ash to make a salty paste for binding. Another prescription includes the root bark of the Lei Ting vine, dried ash pounded and fried for binding, along with the application of Qisheng ointment, while taking the Jiu Jin Liu Ma powder internally.</p>
<p>Swelling and unbearable pain in the back of the foot or toes can be alleviated by elevating the foot; the pain will lessen somewhat. If the foot hangs down, the pain becomes intolerable, referred to as &quot;Inverse Pull Swelling.&quot; Initially, use the two-sided turtle decoction, brewed with wine, followed by the two-sided turtle powder. If ineffective, grind the snake yam and consume it with wine for significant relief.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br><strong>On Gangrene</strong> </p>
<p>Gangrene is an external decay coupled with internal corruption. It arises from the long-term consumption of rich foods, which overheat the internal organs, as well as the use of mineral supplements that deplete kidney vitality. Excessive sexual exertion can also exhaust the Qi and damage essence. Additionally, the use of potent drugs held under the tongue to transform into liquid, which then reaches the lower abdomen, or directed into the navel to cause internal heat, can induce this condition. </p>
<p>Some seek to enhance virility through ointments applied to the groin or by stimulating the male organs, hoping to maintain vigor. This often results in the over-accumulation of Yang essence and rampant sexual fire, leading to heat and dryness within the organs, or poisoning that seeps into the bones, culminating in ulcers and severe sores. </p>
<p>Truly, it reflects the foolish actions of the clever, unheeded by those who fail to protect themselves from hidden misfortunes. The wise often delude themselves into believing good fortune has come, neglecting the degradation of their health, until they realize that their present ailments have a cause, but the remedy eludes them. </p>
<p>This affliction often manifests in the hands and feet, which are the extensions of the five vital organs. Initially, the sores appear as small as a grain of millet, accompanied by blisters resembling cooked jujubes, with dark energy spreading throughout. The pain is intense, like flames spilling forth, while the condition deteriorates to a point where bones weaken and sinews rot. The foul odor is unbearable, and the essence of life becomes elusive. </p>
<p>Thus, it is said that the heart fails due to blood loss, the liver fails due to the death of sinews, the spleen fails due to the decay of flesh, the lungs fail due to the death of skin, and the kidneys fail due to the demise of bones. In these five failures, even the most potent elixirs cannot save a life.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>For those who suffer from this illness, life and death should not be taken lightly. Master Sun said: When the illness is in the flesh, it should be cut; when it is in the finger, it should be sliced. This is indeed the nature of the disease. The treatment should be applied early, taking advantage of the time before it has spread. Use more than ten strands of hair to wrap tightly around the base of the affected finger for ten more turns, gradually tightening it, ensuring that the poisonous gas does not attack the healthy flesh. At the same time, use toad bile pastry, placing it on top of the original grain, and apply moxibustion until the flesh withers and the sore dies off. </p>
<p>The next day, if the finger turns completely black, then use a sharp knife to carefully cut along the seam of the affected joint, gently removing the finger. If the bleeding does not stop, use a gold knife like a holy remedy to stem it, and for any remaining swelling, apply a marvelous poultice. The following day, if there is still black vapor remaining, use only ground toad bile tablets mixed into a powder, cover with ointment, and the black vapor will recede. If pus develops at the site, use the regular method with jade red ointment and other medicines to protect the newly grown flesh and ensure the bone is intact, which is a favorable omen.</p>
<p>Internally, take medications to nourish kidney essence, support vital energy and blood, strengthen the spleen, and calm the spirit. If there are no internal changes and no external complications, there’s a 30-40% chance of recovery. However, if after cutting the black color continues to spread, pain and swelling worsen, and there’s no pus but dry mouth and a hard tongue, leading to a sluggish spirit and tastelessness in food, it will ultimately result in death. </p>
<p>In treating this, one should not rely solely on one’s own judgment but must consult illustrious experts and heed the patient’s wishes regarding the surgery. Furthermore, because this condition can have varying prognoses, it is unwise to act hastily. There are cases that appear similar but are not the same, true conditions that present differently, and detailed annotations are provided later for reference.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>If a sore appears without thirst, with a moist mouth and a harmonious tongue, and the temperament is normal, without sudden violent reactions, following proper etiquette will be auspicious. </p>
<p>In the initial stages, if it resembles a pockmark, is hot and painful, with swelling in a finger, and has constriction at the root, this is auspicious. </p>
<p>Once it has developed, if the head begins to decay, the flesh is neither purple nor black, there is pain but occasionally pus emerges and swelling subsides, this is auspicious. </p>
<p>Upon rupture, if there is first pus and then decay, the flesh appears red and vibrant, the poison does not disperse, and the breath is not foul, this is auspicious. </p>
<p>If thirst precedes the sore, there is an excessive desire for cold, lethargy with a dry tongue, frequent urination, and impotence, this is unfavorable. </p>
<p>In the early stages, if it resembles a grain of millet, the flesh appears purple but does not swell, there is sharp pain, and dark energy spreads, this is unfavorable. </p>
<p>Once developed, if the sore appears withered, the flesh is black and the skin is charred, with pain like being cut by a knife, and the poison spreads favorably, this is unfavorable. </p>
<p>Once it has ruptured, if the flesh is withered and the tendons rotten, with blood and water that are foul and dirty, pain resonates deeply, this is unfavorable. </p>
<p>Treatment methods:<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>Gangrene often occurs on the toes rather than the fingers. When it first appears as a yellow blister, it should be cauterized. If it arises like a grain, with a space inside to hold millet, and the skin is purplish-red without causing burning or swelling, it should still be cauterized. After cauterization, if the wound absorbs heat and forms blisters filled with pus, external medicine should be applied while internally supporting the healing process. When the poison has developed, and the wound is slightly depressed, but the purplish color has not affected the surface of the foot, it should be evaluated for possible surgical removal. After removal, if blood and fluids flow profusely with ongoing pain, one must tonify the qi and blood, and strengthen the spleen and stomach. If recovery is slow, with decreased appetite, body fatigue, dry mouth, and frequent thirst, one should nourish the body fluids and strengthen kidney essence. Following the breakout, if qi and blood are injured, with weak spleen and stomach, spontaneous sweating, feeling hot and nauseous, restless sleep, fever in the afternoon, and severe pain, one must significantly enhance qi and blood. For those indulging in rich and greasy foods, or with repressed desires leading to toxins and stagnant blood over time, one must avoid surgical methods.</p>
<p>Chronic eruptions are caused by improper seasonal elements, manifesting without internal toxins. This condition often appears on the palms and soles, or in the areas of the waist, legs, and buttocks where movement occurs, causing diffuse swelling without a distinct head, aversion to cold, fever, heaviness in the limbs, and intense thirst. At the onset, one should take a universal remedy to induce sweating and relieve the exterior; if the swelling does not subside, it is likely to form pus, and one should take a detoxifying remedy combined with the wax alum pills. Subsequent treatments should follow the established protocols for managing boils, sores, and ulcers.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br><strong>Pomegranate Blister</strong></p>
<p>Pomegranate blister occurs when the Shaoyang fire interacts with external dampness, resulting in a condition that manifests on the inner elbow approximately one inch from the joint. It starts as a small yellow blister, which quickly enlarges, becoming red and firm, swollen like a covered bowl. When the skin ruptures, it exudes, resembling clumped pomegranate seeds and causing cold chills, akin to a severe illness. At the onset, perform moxibustion nine times, and take toad venom pills for sweating to release the hidden poison. Apply moxibustion to the top, stick a toad venom cake on it, and cover with ointment; for swollen areas, apply golden yellow powder. Internally, take chrysanthemum clearing decoction and amber wax alumen pills. If there is severe agitation and fever, use Heart-Protecting Powder and Golden Liquid Earth Pill. After nine days, if the affected area produces thick yellow pus and pain slightly decreases, with symptoms improving inside and out, and if there is slight improvement in appetite, it can be seen as safe; conversely, if not, it is a bad sign. After rupture, if vital energy is weak and mixed symptoms persist, treat according to the methods for managing abscesses.</p>
<p><strong>Ankle Blister</strong></p>
<p>Ankle blister develops from the downward flow and stagnation of damp heat in the three Yin channels of the foot. It initially presents as swelling and pain at the inner ankle, with the pain penetrating to the bone, making movements difficult, and in severe cases, extending to the outer ankle. If the swelling has a head, it indicates a Yang-type easy to break; if no head is present, it is a Yin-type, difficult to rupture. In both cases, at the onset, chills and fever must alternate, and it is advisable to use a modified Jingfang Baidu Powder with added Niuxi Powder; if pus forms and swelling is painful for a long time, acupuncture is recommended; for decay without closure and large openings, double the use of Yuhong Ointment; for those with weakened bodies, provide nourishment. If this condition is not treated, it may lead to a chronic disability.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br><strong>On Gout</strong></p>
<p>Gout occurs when the nail grows into the flesh, or from injuries to the good flesh while trimming nails, or due to tight shoes. The condition manifests as a fleshy growth wrapping around the nail, with unusual swelling and pain, making it difficult to walk. Initially, it is advisable to apply a special medicated paste to the affected area, which will dissolve and heal spontaneously. If the growth becomes hardened over time, a specific powder should be used to break it down, followed by applying pearl powder, ensuring complete recovery.</p>
<p><strong>On Heavenly Snake Poison</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly snake poison, also known as snake head sore, arises from a surge of heart fire. The symptom involves the fingertip swelling like a snake head, with red swelling and intense pain reaching to the heart, and in severe cases, alternating chills and fever occur with the swelling extending upwards. Small moxibustion should be applied to the top of the swelling, and a powder made of realgar should be dusted on it. Internally, toad venom pills can be taken to promote sweating and detoxification. In mild cases, the swelling gradually diminishes; in more severe cases, it may burst and produce pus, and in extreme cases, can lead to decay. After it has burst, if swelling persists, a toad venom stick should be inserted into the opening, covered with a medicated ointment for effectiveness. For decayed areas, a specific ointment should be applied. If the condition shows weakness and does not heal, supplementary tonics should be taken concurrently.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br><strong>He Gu Ding</strong></p>
<p>He Gu Ding, commonly known as Tiger Mouth Hundred Wrinkles, is a condition often characterized by swollen lumps and red streaks, hence the name &quot;Ding.&quot; This affects the hand Yangming stomach channel, where dampness and toxins invade, causing itching or burning pain. At the onset, the affected area should be punctured, then covered with toad venom cake and a golden salve. After three days, if swelling accumulates and pus is formed, change the dressing. For soft, swollen, and painful areas where pus has developed, puncturing will lead to healing. If there is significant swelling and fever, both internal and external treatments are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Lian Chuang</strong></p>
<p>Lian Chuang is formed by the convergence of wind, heat, and damp toxins, distinguishing between new and old cases, as well as internal and external types. For new cases, applying three fragrant ointment or incense paper will lead to self-healing. For slightly older, purplish-black cases, the detoxifying purple gold ointment can gradually alleviate the symptoms. In cases of longstanding, stubborn ulcers with blackened, sunken flesh and foul odor, treatment using centipede plasters is required to dispel wind toxins and dissolve necrotic tissue before healing can occur. For external ulcers, take Si Sheng Wan, and for internal ulcers, take Shen Qi Wan, which is effective.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br><strong>Blood Wind Sores</strong></p>
<p>Blood wind sores arise from the interaction of wind heat, damp heat, and blood heat. When they occur, they cause intense itching, breaking open and leaking fatty fluid, gradually spreading. In severe cases, orally take Xiao Feng San with Niu Xi and Huang Bo; externally apply antidote powder (Xiong Huang San) or Ruyi Jin Huang San as dressings. If the sores are long-standing, purple, blackened, and hardened, causing stagnant qi and blood, use needles to remove the black blood and then use a magical lamp for steaming to dispel toxins. Afterwards, apply the aforementioned medicine for effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Itching of Women&#39;s Feet</strong></p>
<p>Itching of women&#39;s feet originates from the Three Yang wind dampness descending, becoming stagnant and not dispersing. Thus, it first causes itching and later results in damp sores. Additionally, itching and dampness may occur at the curved areas of the soles; a mix of powdered alum can be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Cracked Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>Cracked hands and feet indicate dryness, due to insufficient nourishment from qi and blood. When heat in the muscles is suddenly attacked by wind and cold, it hinders the blood vessels, leading the skin to become increasingly dry and withered, resulting in cracks. Daily exposure to wind and the compounding effects of wind heat cause pain. Use Yu Ji San to wash and rub the skin, and apply a moisturizing ointment. In severe cases, it is also beneficial to take Dang Gui Yin Zi.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br><strong>Crabgrass Bumps</strong></p>
<p>Crabgrass bumps are caused by harm to the spleen from excessive thinking, leading to the stagnation of spleen qi. This condition often affects those with deficient qi and blood; it mainly manifests in the limbs, which are associated with the spleen&#39;s earth element. Initially, there is bone pain, which gradually develops into swelling that is firm and not hot or red. The back of the hand and the inner aspect of the wrist swell in multiple areas, preventing movement. Over time, it resembles the consistency of tofu and leaks a fluid that connects various orifices, flowing continuously day and night, alongside persistent swelling and pain. Patients appear pale and thin, with diminished appetite. Prolonged cases result in alternating chills and fever and internal symptoms manifesting. For treatment, both Qi-nourishing and Shen-boosting medicinal formulas, such as the Qi Nourishing Decoction and the Modified Xiao Yao San, are recommended for harmonizing qi and blood while supporting the spleen and stomach. Of those afflicted, about 12 to 23 out of 100 can recover. However, many die due to insufficient response to treatment, leading to the complete depletion of qi and blood.</p>
<p><strong>Stinking Pond Snails</strong></p>
<p>Stinking pond snails are a result of the damp heat from the Yangming stomach channel attacking and penetrating the body. This ailment typically arises on the toes, initially presenting as white spots that become ulcerated, progressing from itchiness to pain, accompanied by the discharge of foul-smelling fluid, resembling snail shells. In severe cases, the whole foot may swell, with accompanying chills and fever. The first step in treatment is to wash with a licorice decoction and apply toad venom cakes three pieces over three days. Subsequently, use pearl powder mixed with pig spinal marrow for topical application and cover with a medicated ointment. Apply the True Monarch Miracle Paste to reduce swelling. One should refrain from walking.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br><strong>Niu Cheng (Foot Edema)</strong></p>
<p>Niu Cheng (Foot Edema) occurs when one travels rapidly, causing heat and moisture in the feet. This leads to stagnation of qi and depletion of blood, resulting in the formation of hard and stubborn skin. The body fails to nourish the area, gradually causing swelling and pain, with swollen areas becoming high and protruding, making movement difficult. If allowed to persist, they may rupture, leading to pus discharge. Daily cleansing with warm water and applying powdered ox horn, along with addressing internal pus, is recommended. For stubborn skin that does not break, use a large, sharp needle to pierce the area to release pus and provide relief. If the hardened skin ruptures, it should be cut away. If flesh does not grow back, use jade-red ointment to promote its growth. If flesh is present but no new skin has formed, apply pearl powder to help generate skin and achieve healing.</p>
<p><strong>Insect Borers (Cockroach Borer)</strong></p>
<p>Insect borers often occur in the joints of fingers, appearing without redness or heat, and swelling resembling a cicada&#39;s abdomen. This condition is caused by the accumulation of phlegm and qi stagnation in the Hand Shaoyin channel. Initially, it is painless, but over time it becomes painful. Prolonged pain leads to decay, while the swelling persists. Applying toad venom cakes can help create thin pus. This condition may affect those who are physically weak and requires internal nourishing medicines to prevent it from developing into a chronic ailment.</p>
<p><strong>Field Snail Blisters</strong></p>
<p>Field snail blisters typically manifest on hands and feet, feeling as if they are burning with fire, followed by the development of purple, white, and yellow blisters. This is caused by wind and dampness attacking the Spleen channel, leading to gradual swelling, pain, and restlessness. Puncturing the blisters with a needle helps to release toxic fluid, after which a protective ointment should be applied. If blisters reappear, internal detoxification and Spleen-discharging decoctions may lead to healing.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br><strong>Goose Palm Wind</strong></p>
<p>Goose Palm Wind arises from the yangming stomach channel, characterized by hot, dry blood, and is caused by exposure to cold, leading to dry and withered skin. It may also occur when residual toxins from old sores remain. Initially, there are purple spots with white dots; if it persists, the skin becomes dry and thick, continuously cracking. Smoking and washing it with Erfan Decoction will lead to a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Supplementary Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Nuan Abscess occurs on the shoulder and extends to swelling around the shoulder area, characterized by hardness. Dui Abscess appears at the site of the radial artery, with swelling and pain, alternating between cold and heat, affecting the shoulder and causing difficulty in movement. Fu Yin Abscess develops three inches above the inner ankle, starting as small blisters, eventually becoming red and swollen, leading to bleeding and bone-deep pain, making walking impossible. Yao Bone Abscess occurs in the inner thigh, with no swelling or redness, but excruciating pain deep within the marrow; it is best initially treated with the Thunder Fire Needle, accompanied by internal administration of Wansheng Pill, mixed with wine for effectiveness. Yin Abscess arises three inches below the right inner thigh, causing pain radiating to the groin and lower abdomen. Yuan Abscess appears three inches below the left inner thigh, with diffuse swelling affecting the groin, and pain reaching the thigh. </p>
<p>For the above conditions with initial external symptoms, it is advisable to release the exterior; for internal symptoms, one should promote internal flow. After rupture, it is necessary to nourish the area; if it persists, one should focus on contraction. This is the established treatment method; it must not be confused, and one should avoid reckless medication, as it may lead to dire consequences.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>Four Limb Gate</p>
<p>Medical Prescriptions Examination (Ming, Wu Kun)</p>
<p>Discussion on Foot Illness</p>
<p>The foot illness resembles typhoid, thus hard to diagnose; it can lead to death, thus difficult to treat. One disease, two difficulties; this cannot simply be discussed regarding foot illness. I examine seven prescriptions; fellow practitioners, please teach me as well!</p>
<p>Foot illness exhibits aversion to cold or strong heat, and Foria can be the main remedy. The essence of foot illness lies in the damp heat accumulating in the feet, causing painful sensations. When dampness and heat contend, if dampness prevails, it induces cold aversion; if heat prevails, it induces strong heat. This serves as the evidence. There are also those with accompanying headaches, resembling typhoid, yet their illness begins from foot illness, which is different.</p>
<p>One should not restrict based on foot swelling; there are also cases of pain without swelling called &#39;dry foot illness&#39;. Some are characterized by slow progression that does not comply, termed &#39;gentle wind&#39;. Others with painful numbness are called &#39;damp obstruction&#39;, and those with cramping or spasms are termed &#39;wind toxin&#39;. This should be understood and differentiated by physicians, and each has its own treatment methods.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, foot illness is a condition of obstruction, favoring openness and disliking blockage. Hence, Master Sun stated: “Those suffering from foot illness die due to excess qi; not a single person has perished from taking medicine that leads to deficiency.” Therefore, those with foot illness should not receive substantial tonics nor excessive purgatives. The prescriptions consist of Mutong, Foria, and Areca nut, which are harmonizing agents that can relieve blockage. Rhino horn, Huangbai, Sheng Dihuang, and licorice tips are cooling agents that can dispel heat. Cangzhu and Baizhu are drying agents that can eliminate dampness.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>Chuanxiong can disperse the qi within the blood, while rhinoceros horn can promote the blood within the qi. If pain occurs first and then swelling, it indicates that qi has injured the blood; therefore, use more Chuanxiong. If swelling occurs first and then pain, it indicates that blood has injured the qi; hence, use more rhinoceros horn. If the stools are firm, add peach kernel; if the urine is scanty, add cowbane; if there is internal heat, add scutellaria and coptis; if there is seasonal heat, add gypsum; if there is phlegm, add bamboo juice. It all depends on adapting the method; do not be too rigid initially. In cases where foot-related ailments affect the heart, causing persistent wheezing or vomiting, they are all fatal, as water clashes with fire.</p>
<p>In cases of foot-related pain and swelling, with cold and hot sensations intertwined, if the pulse is deep and fine, the prescription should be Guo Bi Decoction. The essence of the pain lies in the obstruction of qi, while the swelling results from stagnation of blood; this is the reason for the confinement of foot illnesses. The interplay of cold and heat signifies the conflict between pathogenic forces and righteous qi. A deep pulse indicates an interior condition, while a fine pulse indicates a yin condition. The name Guo Bi implies surpassing and emerging from the lowest state; &quot;bi&quot; suggests humility. This formula aims to release and elevate the most obstructed qi, hence the name. Gypsum is cold and heavy, with cold able to overcome heat and heaviness able to descend. Aconite is spicy and hot, with spiciness aiding in expelling obstructions and heat promoting qi. When combined with ephedra, the stagnation of cold and heat can be expelled through sweat. Utilizing white atractylodes and licorice, which have a warm and balanced flavor, can help harmonize the Qi and facilitate elevation beyond obstruction. However, licorice should be used sparingly, as its slow nature could delay swift action towards the lowest areas.</p>
<p>In cases of cold-damp foot ailments, characterized by pain and numbness, if the pulse at both ankles is deep and fine, the prescription should be Six Medicines Aconite Decoction, treating this as a painful obstruction syndrome.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When cold dominates, it results in painful obstruction; when dampness dominates, it leads to blockage. Presently, if there is pain and numbness, it is due to both cold and dampness. The pulse at the two inches (measure of the body) pertains to the two feet; a pulse that is deep indicates an interior condition, and a slow pulse indicates cold. </p>
<p>For treatment, use the heartwood of cinnamon and aconite to warm the cold, while prepared leech and white atractylodes address the dampness. Licorice and poria are beneficial for the spleen, helping to support the deficient earth energy and control the excess dampness. It is essential to take cooling medicines to ensure the properties of cinnamon and aconite act downward and do not spread horizontally.</p>
<p>In cases of foot qi (pathological condition) transforming into internal issues, it leads to an inability to have smooth bowel movements. If foot qi affects the liver, there may be a lump in the left flank; if it affects the spleen, it causes a feeling of fullness; if it affects the heart, it may result in death at night, as the night energy supports the yin evils. </p>
<p>Due to extreme cold, if one is unaware of their condition, the yin invades and the yang cannot be released. Thus, cedar wood decoction is recommended, as cedar is dense and aromatic—dense enough to reach downward and aromatic enough to disperse stagnation. The flavor of citrus leaves is bitter and rich, surpassing that of green peel; areca nut is solid and heavy, comparable to iron stone. A rich taste promotes downward movement, and dense material causes descent, allowing the pathogenic qi to descend significantly.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s urine is salty and cold; the salty nature can lead pathogenic qi to exit with turbid yin, while the cold can balance excessive heat and prevent it from rising. The text states: &quot;What is distant in the Way must be greatly controlled.&quot; Therefore, the quantity is five sheng. </p>
<p>For those suffering from cold damp foot qi, with pain and numbness, they should take decoctions internally and wash externally with a pepper soup.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>Pepper can treat the cold and dampness causing obstruction, while ginger and scallions, being warm and pungent, can help promote the flow of energy in the skin. It is also said that all cases of &quot;foot disease&quot; are caused by obstruction and washing will yield no benefit. For swollen and painful foot conditions accompanied by damp heat and yellowing, the main treatment is a formula called &quot;Tianwen Pain Decoction.&quot; This is because the obstruction within the feet causes pain and swelling, and the damp heat cannot be released, leading to yellowing. The ingredients in this formula, such as Qianghuo, Fangfeng, Shengma, Gegen, and Cangzhu, are all warm and dispersing agents that can relieve the obstructed foot condition. Additionally, Ku Shen, Huangqin, Yinchin, and Zhimu are bitter and cold substances that can remove the internal damp heat. Finally, Zexie, Zhuling, and Baizhu are mild diuretics effective in promoting the drainage of dampness in the lower body.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>Angelica, ginseng, and licorice are used to nourish the blood after depletion and to replenish energy following excessive loss. For those with weak spleen-qi and downward-acting stomach-qi, resulting in edema in the feet and ankles, the Decoction for Raising Yang and Harmonizing Qi is the remedy. Although the spleen possesses the qualities of stability, it has the ability to promote strength; when spleen-qi is harmonious, it can lift the clear up and lower the turbid, preventing edema. When spleen-qi is deficient, the earth cannot control water, causing the fluids from food in the stomach to descend and result in leg swelling. In this formula, pinellia and licorice are used to strengthen the spleen; ginseng and astragalus are for replenishing energy; fermented malt and cardamom help digest and transform food; ephedra and bupleurum lift the stomach qi; angelica directs other herbs back to the spleen; and dried tangerine peel facilitates the movement of qi in the middle burner. The use of phellodendron is to draw out its richness, guiding ephedra and bupleurum downwards to the legs, while simultaneously lifting the sinking yang.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br><strong>Medical Practices of the Physician&#39;s Realm [Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Treatment of Beriberi with the Enhanced Eight Flavor Pill</strong></p>
<p>The ancient formula, the Eight Flavor Pill of the Cui family, incorporates two yang herbs—Aconite and Cinnamon—alongside six yin herbs including Rehmannia. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; text suggests its use for treating beriberi, which ascends and affects the lower abdomen, indicating a thought that is rather subtle. It implies that when earth energy increases towards heaven, one must use the aggressive properties of Ginger and Aconite to overcome it. </p>
<p>When the earth energy arrives in the lower abdomen, it dwells on the boundary of extreme yin, which predicates that there is no reason for excessive agitation; thus, only yang herbs are added to the yin herbs for treatment, and there is no need for a complete focus on yang. </p>
<p>In cases where kidney water overflows, causing issues like urinary difficulties in women—referred to as &quot;transforming the womb&quot;—the formula’s name is changed to Kidney Energy Pill, although the ingredients remain the same. This is because it captures the kidney energy, allowing the kidney water to return to its source, leading to normalized urination, hence there is no need to overly emphasize yang. </p>
<p>In consideration of this, when treating conditions characterized by yang deficiency and yin excess, it is essential to utilize purely yang without incorporating yin. There is no further doubt on this approach.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>Later generations, when dealing with foot odor entering the abdomen, find the lower abdomen lacking sensation, and experience a sudden onset of shortness of breath, vomiting, and sweating. They fail to recognize that the earthly energy has intensified and affects the heavenly energy. Using this formula inappropriately, they claim this symptom is most urgent, citing the kidney overpowering the heart, with water overcoming fire, leading to death in an instant. Using the original formula with double the amounts of aconite and cinnamon can only be seen as fifty steps laughing at a hundred steps; it does not address the critical illness, as the kidney overpowering the heart and water overcoming fire is the most immediate concern. They do not understand that the organs mutually hinder each other, which poses a significant danger, and they cannot discern the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhu proposed treating foot odor by transforming the Eight Flavor Pill into the Eight Flavor Decoction, using aconite, dried ginger, peony, poria, licorice, cinnamon heart, ginseng, and white atractylodes. The reasoning is quite refined, and by further adapting the peony, licorice, and ginseng in clinical practice, it enhances its efficacy. However, unwise individuals again insert their interpretations into this decoction, removing the cinnamon heart and adding dried rehmannia, switching yin for yang—what a drastic deviation! Yet the formula texts are all mixed together, and who recognizes them as the offenders against Zhu’s proposal?<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br><strong>Inability to Lift the Limbs</strong></p>
<p>When a stroke causes the limbs to be unable to lift, it can be either deficiency or excess. If there is deficiency in the Yangming, the tendons lose their nourishment, and the bones cannot be bound, leading to difficulty in movement. If there is excess in the Yangming, the flesh becomes dense, and with the invasion of wind, the upright Qi cannot circulate. For deficiency, use Six Gentlemen Decoction; for excess, combine Three Transformations Decoction with Purging the Qi Decoction. When treating stroke-induced limb inabilities, if one cannot distinguish between deficiency and excess and recklessly tries to tonify or drain, the practitioner is at fault. The inability to lift the limbs all pertains to the spleen and earth element. If there is excessive consumption of rich foods, leading to internal heat and congestion, it indicates stagnation in the spleen, and it should be drained to relieve this blockage. If there is little food intake and the body is thin, along with lethargy and a tendency to sleep, it indicates deficiency and weakness of the spleen, and it should be tonified to strengthen its function. If one indiscriminately tonifies the excess and drains the deficiency, could it not harm the patient?</p>
<p><strong>Weakness of the Feet and Knees</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, one may experience weakness in the feet and knees, with coolness in the lower buttocks, damp and foul-smelling sweat, and a slippery, unstable essence. The pulse is deep, rapid, and strong, indicating internal fire stagnation forcing yin outward, with excessive yang resisting yin. In such cases, bitter and cold medicines should be used to purge. This reflects the subtle signs of water and fire imbalance, and the elegance of pulse and symptom treatment principles should be applied accordingly.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>Crane knee wind refers to the stiffness caused by wind, cold, and dampness affecting the knee. If the bones of the knee grow larger over time and the surrounding muscles become thin and withered, and one cannot yet treat the knee itself, one must first nourish the blood and qi, allowing the muscles to gradually thrive before treating the knee. This approach is similar to treating cases where one side of the body is withered. Once there is atrophy, one must first nourish the parts that are not yet withered, so that the withered parts may regain circulation and vitality. If one does not understand the principle of drawing qi to nourish blood, and blood to aid qi, but simply uses herbs like Ephedra and Ledebouriella to dispel wind, there are few who are not completely withered and perishing. Thus, in treating crane knee wind by hastily attacking the stiffness, one must also consider the atrophy of the foot, which becomes unusable. Consequently, when discussing the treatment approach, isn&#39;t it evident?</p>
<p>The ancient method for treating children with crane knee wind involves using the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill augmented with deer antler and cattle knee, totaling eight ingredients, without addressing the wind; this is the most commendable intention. For children&#39;s cases are not necessarily due to wind, cold, or dampness, but often result from innate deficiencies, where the kidney energy is weak and cold accumulates in the lower back and knees, causing obstruction. Therefore, the Six Flavors Pill replenishes the water in the kidneys; deer antler supplements the fire in the kidneys; and cattle knee directs it to the joints to strengthen the tendons and muscles. This is an excellent method of treating the root rather than the symptoms, using this example to generalize the principle.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br><strong>On Gout</strong></p>
<p>The concept of gout did not exist in ancient times; it was first named during the Jin Dynasty by Su Jing. However, its symptoms of swelling, pain, and numbness are what the classics refer to as &quot;bi&quot; (obstruction); its looseness and inability to retract correspond to &quot;wei&quot; (atrophy) in the classics; and when severe enough to cause an upward rush, it corresponds to &quot;jue ni&quot; (counterflow) in the classics. </p>
<p>Later generations distinguished it as one of the four patterns of fever, categorizing it as gout if a person exhibits headaches, fever, body pain, and constipation, accompanied by weak and powerless legs and knees. This explanation is too muddled; I disagree with it. Gout is fundamentally a disease caused by dampness and blockage, not an exterior pathogenic invasion. There are cases where multiple symptoms may occur together, but if one misidentifies weakness of the legs due to external pathogens as gout, it leads to confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Now I will omit the unnecessary details and summarize the key points, ensuring no aspect is overlooked for clarity. </p>
<p>Initially, the symptoms of gout are very mild, with diet and movement remaining normal; it may suddenly appear without any other illness or develop gradually following another illness. When the disease manifests, it can affect the area from the knees to the feet in various ways: numbness, cold pain, weakness, cramps, swelling or no swelling, gradual atrophy, or fluctuating between fever and chills. It may feel as if water is cold or fire is hot; there may be a change in appetite, it may be possible or impossible to eat, or one may feel a sensation of something like a finger pressing down from the calf, causing a rush of qi to ascend to the heart. All of these represent the true illness of gout.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>There are symptoms such as fever and headache, alternating chills and fever, abdominal pain, vomiting upon seeing food, aversion to the smell of food, reluctance to see light, confusion in speech, and mental disorientation; all of these are accompanying symptoms of beriberi. Generally, these symptoms can be either mild or severe: in mild cases, they gradually appear, worsening over two or three months; in severe cases, they arise quickly, sometimes within one or two days. If treated as mild when it is severe, there is a risk that the internal energy could rise to the heart, potentially leading to death.</p>
<p>The causes of beriberi are twofold: one from external sources and one from internal factors. The external causes involve the influence of cold, dampness, rain, and humidity, or sitting or lying on damp ground, which leads to the invasion of damp pathogens into the skin, flesh, and tendons. When dampness affects vulnerability, the illness begins in the lower body, resulting in leg and foot problems. The internal causes stem from excessive consumption of rich, sweet foods, alcohol, and unrestrained intake of foods like dairy products that create damp heat, which causes heat to obstruct the lower regions of the body, leading to swelling and pain in the legs, or even affecting the hands and joints.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was said that in the southern regions where the climate is humid, illnesses are often caused by external factors, whereas in the north, where there is a penchant for alcoholic beverages, illnesses are commonly due to internal factors. This is indeed one perspective. However, the north also has cold dampness, and the south certainly cannot be devoid of wine-related dampness. Thus, it need not be strictly categorized by geographical regions. Whether the cause is internal or external, any invasion of harmful qi resulting in illness that begins in the feet and gradually leads to other symptoms is referred to as beriberi. It is essential to investigate the cause and to treat it; if done correctly, there will be no errors.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>The disease of athlete&#39;s foot is indeed caused by the three energies, yet there are also distinctions between deficiency and excess. Furthermore, athlete&#39;s foot is fundamentally a condition of stagnation. The ancients cautioned against the use of tonics; however, it is only when the fundamentals are insufficient and the energy of Yangming is impaired that the evil energies are allowed to invade, and there are also cases of deficiency involved. In summary, for all treatments of this condition, it is essential to apply remedies based on the symptoms; thus, management will be thorough. If the cause lies externally, focus primarily on dispersion; if the cause lies internally, emphasize unblocking and benefiting. External causes are often associated with cold and dampness, so warming treatments are advisable; internal causes frequently involve dampness and heat, hence cooling treatments should be employed. If the original energy is fundamentally deficient or if prolonged illness has led to deficiency, it is essential to nourish the foundations and one must not be bound by the notion of avoiding tonics.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>When athlete&#39;s foot first appears, it is primarily due to dampness and stagnation. If there are no other concurrent symptoms, and the body feels heavy, then one should focus on treating the dampness, primarily through diuresis. </p>
<p>For general dampness in the feet and knees, or when there is soreness and heaviness in the waist and legs, one should use a dampness-dissipating decoction, regardless of whether the condition is recent or longstanding, or whether it is dry or damp. If there is soreness and heaviness in the feet and knees, accompanied by unclear stomach qi, or symptoms like belching, acid reflux, or fullness, then Ping Wei San (a formula for regulating the stomach) is recommended. For swelling inthe feet accompanied by diarrhea, one should use Wu Ling San or Wei Ling Tang.</p>
<p>When cold and dampness invade from the outside and lead to athlete&#39;s foot, this accounts for about sixty to seventy percent of cases. Symptoms typically include pain, cramping, aversion to cold, and a thin, wiry pulse. The treatment should focus on warming the meridians and dispelling dampness. Therefore, ancient remedies primarily used warming herbs and fewer cooling ones, often employing materials like Ma Huang, Chuan Wu, Gui, Fu, and Gan Jiang.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Dampness that prevails within should be treated with bitter and warming herbs.&quot; This is why herbs like Wu and Fu, along with Ma Huang, are able to move without obstruction, thus facilitating the circulation of the meridians.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>Cinnamon and dried ginger are hot and spicy, which is why they can aid yang and dispel yin. Once dampness is cleared, no illness remains uncured. </p>
<p>If one is affected by cold dampness from rain or through the seasonal changes, resulting in painful and swollen feet, it is advisable to use Jieming powder like a miracle. If cold dampness invades the body, with yang deficiency and excess yin, weak stomach qi, obstructed menstrual flow, stubborn water retention and persistent pain, use Duhuo decoction. If cold pathogens invade the abdomen, causing breathlessness and pain, or if there is quick, intense discomfort, use Wu zhu yu pills or Wu zhu yu and papaya soup. If cold dampness affects the meridians, causing disharmony in the blood vessels, with soreness and weakness in the waist and legs, or with cramps and pain, along with a weak and sluggish pulse, use liquor-soaked Niuxi pills. If cold dampness causes swelling, with stagnant qi that does not circulate, or accompanied by cold or pain, use Lixiao powder for immediate effect.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>If there is a combination of cold, dampness, and wind, remedies such as Wujisan and Xiao Xueming Decoction are suitable, as detailed later. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Damp heat internally steaming, leading to beriberi, is often due to irregular eating and drinking. The symptoms will include irritability, fever, and excessive thirst, with a slippery and rapid pulse; urination may be excessive or difficult. The treatment should primarily focus on draining dampness and clearing heat. If damp heat stagnates, resulting in swelling and pain in the feet and legs, adjust the Fangji Decoction for treatment; alternatives include Cangzhu Huangbo Pill, Ermiaosan, or the modified Ermiaowan, which are equally effective. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If damp heat obstructs upward, causing chest and abdominal distress, intense thirst, restlessness, headache, and dry mouth, use the Huoren Xijiao Powder. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If damp heat flows into the meridians, causing joint pain, heavy sensation in shoulders and back, and generalized pain and swelling in hands and feet, use the Danggui Nian Tong Wan. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If one has a cold with summer dampness, presenting joint pain, fever, thirst, and reddish urination along with qi deficiency and shortness of breath, use the Qing Shu Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If liver and kidney yin deficiency leads to blood heat, causing pain in the feet and knees, difficulty in movement, and poor urination, use the Xuduan Wan.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>If there is a blockage and reverse qi due to edema, the symptoms will include shortness of breath, fullness, and urgent breathing, affecting the heart and abdomen, potentially leading to critical danger. The treatment should primarily focus on moving stagnation and descending qi.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For edema that rises to the heart and abdomen, causing shortness of breath and inability to sleep or lie down, Shi Su San or Bing Lang Tang can be used, or modified versions of Bing Lang Tang, with severe cases requiring Si Mo Yin. If the edema causes shortness of breath, abdominal fullness, and swelling of the legs, Sang Bai Pi San or Mu Tong San should be employed. If there is a rise of qi below the navel, leading to agitation and discomfort in the heart, Mu Xiang San or Bing Lang San is recommended. If there is a feeling of oppression in the chest, with nausea, reverse vomiting, excessive phlegm, and inability to eat, Ban Xia San or Zi Su Tang should be taken. In cases of puffiness, oppression in the heart and abdomen, difficult urination, Da Fu Pi San is appropriate.</p>
<p>In instances where wind-dampness combines with evil to cause edema, the symptoms will necessarily include external pathogens, manifesting as alternating chills and fever, shortness of breath, cough, erratic flow, or pain in the muscles and bones. The treatment should mainly focus on dispersing wind, eliminating dampness, and facilitating the circulation of the meridians.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>If one experiences seasonal winds causing dampness and rheumatism, or resides in a humid place, resulting in weak legs and feet, muscle and joint pain, or alternating chills and fever, use Baidu San. If the chills and fever resemble malaria, with redness and pain, add medicated Baidu San. If the foot condition is due to wind, cold, and dampness invading the meridians, causing unbearable soreness in the bones and marrow, or all-over pain accompanied by chills and nausea, use Wuju San, adding three whole scorpions soaked in wine for preparation. If the foot condition is caused by lingering wind and dampness, with exterior cold blocking, and if there is unrelieved surface evil or symptoms like coughing and wheezing with chills and fever, use Xiao Qing Long Tang. If there is lingering wind and dampness, causing limb and joint pain, and mental distress, use Da Fu Zi San. </p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: if the pulse for the foot condition is large and weak, it is advisable to take two doses of Xiao Xu Ming Tang for prompt recovery. </p>
<p>The &quot;Living Person&quot; states: for foot conditions related to cold, prepare Xiao Xu Ming Tang and take it with fresh ginger juice for the quickest effect.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br>If the symptoms of foot qi and rheumatism are severe and accompanied by fever and cough, along with pain in the limbs, use the Xiang Su San. If foot qi and rheumatism present with flowing pain, aversion to cold, fever, and no sweating, use the Ma Huang Zuo Jing Decoction.</p>
<p>For those with foot qi presenting with deficiency signs, the pulses of the spleen, stomach, liver, and kidneys all correspond to the feet. Since external pathogens can easily enter through weaknesses, liver deficiency leads to muscle disorders, kidney deficiency causes bone problems, spleen deficiency results in muscle issues, and stomach deficiency relates to ligament disorders. This may arise from excessive labor, excessive dampness from alcohol, or post-illness imbalances. Those with internal deficiencies and external foot qi symptoms are generally dealing with deficiency conditions. The focus should be on nourishment and supplementation while also considering the four seasonal influences for treatment. If liver and kidney yin are deficient, and one is affected by the four seasonal changes, leading to paralysis, hemiplegia, weakness in the legs and knees, and full-body pain, administer Shen Ying Yang Zhen Dan, or the San Yin Si Jin Wan, or Hu Gu Jiu, or Ba Wei Di Huang Wan.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>If there is great deficiency in the spleen and stomach, with cold yin below, and yang qi not circulating, leading to beriberi, administer Du Huo Decoction or Fuzi Eight Herb Decoction. If there is insufficient essence and blood, with yin deficiency below, and qi not returning to essence, causing beriberi to rise and surge towards the heart, use Rehmannia Decoction. If there is deficiency and cold in the spleen and stomach, combined with external wind-dampness causing beriberi, use Wind-Inviting Du Huo Decoction or Chasing Poison Decoction. If there is deficiency and cold in the spleen and kidneys accompanied by cough, reversed qi, and vomiting, additionally use Hou Po Decoction.</p>
<p>For beriberi with excess evil, characterized by obstruction, swelling and pain that may lead to blockage or distention, the treatment should primarily aim to expel and resolve. If there is excess wind-dampness causing swollen and painful beriberi, with constipation and abdominal fullness, use Qiang Huo Dao Zhi Decoction or Zhi Shi Da Huang Decoction. If there is an influx of the four qi, with yangming wind-heat, swelling and pain in the waist and feet, constipation, and abdominal pain, administer Da Huang Zuo Jing Decoction. If there is indigestion related to food intake, along with a sensation of fullness beneath the heart and swollen legs and feet, use Kai Jie Dao Yin Pill.</p>
<p>For severe swelling and pain in beriberi, one can use poultices to disperse it, or use pepper and mugwort bags for warmth, or decoct fragrant dispersing herbs for washing. For example, Bai Cao Decoction, along with Fang Feng, Jing Jie, Ling Xian, Ai Ye, Cang Zhu, She Chuang Zi, Dang Gui, and Wu Yao can all be used. Alternatively, single use of Zi Su or Jin Yin Hua, decocted for washing, is also excellent.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br><strong>Taboo</strong></p>
<p>It is said in &quot;The Living Man&quot; and other texts that any tonic herbs taken for athlete&#39;s foot, and those used for soaking and washing, are prohibited by doctors. This is but a partial view. There are indeed certain tonics that should be avoided, particularly those that might cause stagnation of evil energies. Similarly, certain washing methods should be avoided if they involve water that exacerbates dampness or heat. If the lower body is deficient and cold, whether due to an illness or excessive depletion, and the athlete&#39;s foot does not improve, how can one still prohibit tonics? Furthermore, if cold, damp, or hot evils are obstructing and causing swelling or pain, one should use aromatic and dispersive herbs in stews or washes to quickly expel the evils. How can washing be prohibited in such cases? However, if damp heat is rising and disturbing the heart and abdomen, one should not wash abruptly, as this might further elevate dampness. It is essential to first lower the energy; once the toxins are resolved in the feet, washing can be performed without detriment. Toning is for replenishing weakness, while washing is for expelling stagnation. Thus, why should there be any prohibition?</p>
<p><strong>On Ancient Practices</strong></p>
<p>Yang Dashou stated: Athlete&#39;s foot is a condition of stagnation; therefore, one should use dispersing agents to prevent energy from becoming stagnant. Remedies like Qianghuo Daodi Decoction and similar ones are effective. Additionally, herbs such as Cangshu, Baizhu, Fangji, and Nanzheng are used to remove dampness; Qianghuo, Duhuo, Mugua, and Binglang help facilitate energy and relieve joint blockages; while guiding herbs like Mutong and Niuxi direct the treatment, and Danggui and Shengdi Huang harmonize the blood. These are essential medicines. Likewise, methods from Dongyuan for pain are also quite effective; I analyze the deficiency or excess of weakness and heat and distinguish treatments accordingly. This represents a flexible approach to healing.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the knees swell and ache while the legs are thin and small, it is called Crane Knee Wind, named for its resemblance to the shape of a crane&#39;s knee. Sometimes, it manifests simply as swelling in both knees, with thin and withered legs that cannot bend or stretch, commonly referred to as Drumstick Wind. Ultimately, it results from the afflictions of wind, cold, and dampness. However, swelling and pain must be due to an obstruction, while thinning and withering are usually caused by blood deficiency. </p>
<p>For treating this condition, the primary focus must be on nourishing qi and nourishing blood. If there is wind, one must also dispel it; if there is cold and dampness, these must be eliminated as well. If the condition develops into heat due to obstruction, it is essential to nourish yin and clear heat, and recovery will inevitably follow. If it arises after dysentery, it is also known as Post-Dysentery Wind, as the loss of yin during diarrhea requires strengthening of the kidneys. </p>
<p>For cases with dominance of cold, it is advisable to use formulations like Sanqi Drink, Wujisci Powder, or Da Fang Feng Decoction; for those with dominance of dampness, Wuling Powder or Lijiang Decoction are appropriate; and for heat dominance, Baoyin Decoction or Da Qin Jiao Decoction should be used. If insufficient yang energy leads to failure in the limbs, it is necessary to use Yang Gui Pill, Liyi Decoction, and Eight Ingredients of Rehmannia Pill or similar remedies.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br><strong>Secret Prescription of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain in Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>If someone experiences pain in their hands and feet, people may attribute it to heat in the spleen channel, not realizing that it is not the spleen but rather the stagnation of liver wood. By dispersing this stagnation, the pain in the hands and feet will go away. Use a prescription of Xiaoyao San (Free and Easy Wanderer Powder) with three qian of gardenia fruit, two qian each of pinellia and white mustard seed, decoct in water and take it. After two doses, the pain will be as if it has vanished. It is said that when the liver wood causes trouble, the spleen does not dare to confront its sharpness, and the qi disperses into the limbs, becoming constrained and unyielding, which is why pain arises. Now, once the liver qi is balanced, the spleen qi will naturally relax. When the spleen relaxes, is there a pain remaining in the hands and feet that cannot be eliminated? </p>
<p>For those with pain in their hands and feet, have one person hold the body while two others gently press down on each leg, one on the left foot and one on the right, lightly tapping them a thousand times. They will feel a slight relief in both feet. Then, use the hand to hold the area between the knee and ankle, gently stretch it seven times, and finally, loosen the grip and knead the feet a thousand times before stopping. Do the same for both hands. Within a day, the pain in the hands and feet can be alleviated.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br>For pain in the legs and below the waist, use two liters of yellow wine, half a pound of astragalus, five ounces of Coix seed, one ounce of Eucommia bark, five qian of poria and saposhnikovia, three qian of plantago seeds, and one qian of cinnamon. Boil with a bowl of water until it reduces to two bowls of juice. Add this to the wine, and consuming it will lead to recovery. The aforementioned pains are due to wind entering the limbs, head, between the shoulder blades, and below the waist. The use of yellow wine is essential, as it reaches all pathways, directing the medicinal properties straight to the afflicted areas. The pain in the waist and feet clearly belongs to kidney deficiency and weakened qi, which cannot facilitate movement; coupled with dampness, this results in suffering. The essence lies in not supplementing the kidney but solely boosting qi. Sufficient qi generates blood, and when blood is formed, the pathogens retreat. Additionally, Coix seed, poria, and plantago aid in removing dampness, and with the dampness gone, the blood becomes more vibrant. Moreover, adding Eucommia for strengthening the kidneys, and cinnamon for warming the kidneys, along with saposhnikovia for dispelling wind, creates a synergistic effect. They support and complement each other, which is a natural principle.</p>
<p>For soreness in both legs, this indicates that dampness has penetrated the bones, while there may be no external dampness. The remedy consists of two ounces of Coix seed, one ounce of fox nut, three qian of poria, one qian each of cinnamon and rhizoma of ligusticum, and two qian of achyranthes. Boil with water and take as a decoction.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br>The essence of this method lies in the fact that Job&#39;s tears can penetrate the bones and eliminate moisture, while adding water chestnut strengthens the spleen to dispel dampness, preventing moisture from accumulating further. Moreover, Achyranthes and Rhizoma Dioscoreae are particularly beneficial for the lower limbs, and with the addition of cinnamon to guide the herbs directly into the bones, how could the dampness remain and how could the pain persist? However, ailments in the feet are the lower aspects of the human body, and any illness is hard to eradicate. Furthermore, when dampness is lodged in the bones, it resembles low-lying land that has long become a pool; simply carting away the water won&#39;t suffice. It requires considerable effort before it can be fully drained, thus necessitating prolonged and repeated application, which is precisely the intent here.</p>
<p>Foot pain is prevalent and difficult to treat because the feet represent the lower aspect of the body, and when dampness invades, it accumulates stubbornly. Therefore, one must elevate the vital energy for the dampness to disperse. Nowadays, people often use Pingwei Powder to treat dampness, which is indeed a well-trodden approach, yet it ultimately cannot resolve the dampness completely. I propose a new formula that can thoroughly address the invasion of dampness in the feet.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br>This formula prescribes three qian each of ginseng and white atractylodes, one liang of astragalus, and one qian each of fangfeng, chaihu, and cinnamon. It includes five qian each of coix seed, white peony, and water chestnut, five fen of dried tangerine peel, and two qian of pinellia, all to be decocted in water and taken as a remedy. This formula is a divine medicine for expelling dampness. Using fangfeng among astragalus enhances energy and eliminates dampness, while chaihu helps to soothe the qi, making the energy rise even more. When the energy rises, the moisture also enters the spleen. The formula also contains white atractylodes, water chestnut, and coix seed, which are all excellent in removing water and dampness. Could there be any that fails to work? </p>
<p>A person experiences swelling and pain in their thigh, hardened like stone, suffering immensely, wanting to tie their foot with a rope and suspend it from a beam; only then does the pain stop. When placed down, the pain returns as if hacked. With a loud sound, the swelling moves from the thigh up to the upper arm, swelling to the size of a dou (a measure), making sitting impossible. Hanging a cloth bag brings relief; this is also related to supernatural causes. </p>
<p>The formula calls for one liang of raw licorice and three liang of white peony, to be decocted in water. The raw licorice specifically purges toxic gas, while white peony calms the liver to stop pain. When the pain ceases, the swelling can subside; when the toxins are expelled, the supernatural effects can be prevented.<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br><strong>Numbness in the Hands</strong></p>
<p>Numbness in the hands is caused by a deficiency of vital energy and the invasion of wind and dampness. It is essential to use medicinal substances that enter the hand channels and eliminate wind and dampness for effective treatment. The formula includes five qian each of white atractylodes and astragalus, two qian of ginseng, five fen each of dried tangerine peel, leitchi root, and cinnamon twig, and one qian of licorice, to be boiled in water for consumption. In this formula, astragalus, ginseng, and white atractylodes replenish qi and eliminate dampness, while leitchi root expels wind; however, it is crucial to include cinnamon twig for it to effectively enter the hand channels. Once the meridians are cleared, healing will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Redness in the Soles of the Feet</strong></p>
<p>When the soles of the feet are red like fire and cannot touch the ground, and it is not due to phlegm toxins, persisting throughout the year without recovery, this condition arises from the use of hot medicines, leading to congestion of heat in the soles without dispersal, causing prolonged suffering. The proper method is to use internal medications to resolve it. If treated externally, it will likely result in sores on the soles. The formula includes three liang of prepared rehmannia, five qian each of cornelian cherry, poria, and sweet chrysanthemum, three qian each of schisandra, alisma, plantain seed, peony bark, and achyranthes, one liang each of ophiopogon, and two qian of cowbane, boiled in water for consumption. Ten doses will reduce symptoms, and twenty doses will lead to complete recovery. Sexual activities should be avoided for three months; otherwise, a relapse may occur, which could be fatal.<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br><strong>Loss of Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>There is evidence that when a person loses their hands and feet, they do not necessarily die. This occurs during a time of typhoid, when excessive thirst leads to drinking cold water to temporarily quench the thirst. Little do they know that the water stagnates in the abdomen and cannot be promptly dispersed, resulting in illness in the limbs, causing qi and blood to be obstructed. Over time, the hands and feet may rot, leading to the loss of fingers and toes. Sometimes, after losing toes, the soles can also rot, and eventually, the entire soles may fall off.</p>
<p>If someone with typhoid experiences extreme thirst and drinks too much cold water, should they recover but find their fingers and toes emerging from the water, they should urgently use my remedy to address the loss of fingers and soles. The formula consists of three taels of coix seeds, two taels of poria, one qian of cinnamon, one tael of white atractylodes, and five qian of plantago seeds, boiled in water and taken as a decoction. This should be done for ten consecutive doses. It will promote urination and prevent the emergence of fingers and toes. There will be no future complications, and additional doses are unnecessary.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a></p>
<h3>Nail Loss</h3>
<p>Some people have their fingernails completely drop off, with no pain or itchiness. This is due to a deficiency in the fire of the kidney channel. After engaging in sexual activity and washing their hands with cold water, this condition arises. The treatment is to use Six Flavor Decoction with the addition of Chai Hu, Bai Shao, and Gu Sui Bu to achieve recovery.</p>
<h3>Bleeding Between the Fingers</h3>
<p>Some individuals experience continuous bleeding between their fingers, with tiny insects similar to mayflies emerging and quickly able to fly away. This condition is caused by damp heat generating insects. However, why can these insects fly? This is because it is not only damp heat involved but also accompanied by wind pathogenic factors. All insects that are affected by wind can have wings and fly. How can they not fly when the wind energy affects the human body? The prescription consists of Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Dong Gui, Bai Shao, and Sheng Gan Cao each at 9 grams, Ren Shen, Chai Hu, Chuan Xiong, and Jing Jie each at 3 grams, and Shu Di, Huang Qi, and Yi Ren each at 25 grams, to be boiled and consumed as a decoction. The brilliance of this formula lies in that it does not focus on killing the insects but instead nourishes Qi and blood, while also helping to eliminate dampness and wind. When the Qi and blood in the human body are harmonious, insects naturally do not arise. By nourishing the harmony of Qi and blood, there will be no place for insects to hide. Furthermore, by dispelling water and wind, where can the insects live? This is what makes this formula both simple and remarkable. After taking four doses, the bleeding ceases and the insects do not emerge. After taking another four doses, the fingers will return to their original condition.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Elevation in the Palm</strong></p>
<p>Within the palm, a sudden elevation of an inch occurs, without pain or itch. This is due to the fire of the Yangming channel not dispersing and accumulating in the hand. Typically, it should cause pain or itch, but now there is none. Not only is the fire congested in the pores, but also water is blocked in the skin. The method should employ external medicine to dissipate it. The fire of Yangming being intense must lead to thirst, prompting continual drinking. However, the absence of thirst suggests that the fire in the stomach has completely dispersed, turning into poison in the palm. This indicates that the individual&#39;s Yangming fire was initially strong, and pressing the hand against a bed or mat forcefully impeded the circulation of qi and blood in the palm. Over time, the elevation occurs without pain or itch, essentially becoming dead flesh.</p>
<p>Using a decoction of Aconite, soak the hand until it cools, and continue this for ten days. Eventually, there will certainly be pain, and further soaking will lead to itch, after which the elevated area will flatten. Aconite is extremely warming, entering through all meridians; even external application will penetrate internally. If Aconite is used in a soup for drinking, it will warm the entire body and stimulate the stomach fire, preventing the flesh of the palm from dissipating while internally causing a rise in heat. This is why I treat it externally to achieve healing. Additionally, in the Aconite decoction, adding a little light powder can draw it into the bone marrow for even more remarkable effects.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br><strong>Flesh Lump on the Calf</strong></p>
<p>When a person develops a large flesh lump above the calf, resembling a tumor yet not exactly a tumor, and upon pressing it causes excruciating pain, it is due to dampness from the spleen channel condensing into this lump, compounded by internal heat that isn&#39;t dispelled. Hence, it should not be pressed; pressing it intensifies the pain to the point of despair. The appropriate treatment is to vigorously tonify the spleen&#39;s energy and disperse the dampness. However, as it expresses externally in an odd form, eliminating it internally at once may not be easy. Therefore, a method of simultaneous internal and external attack should be employed for natural resolution.</p>
<p>For the internal remedy, use one liang each of white atractylodes, job&#39;s tears, and fox nut; five qian of water plantain; five fen of cinnamon; three qian each of plantago seed, ginseng, rhizoma dioscoreae, white alum, and white mustard seed; two qian each of pinellia, dried tangerine peel, and achyranthes; and decoct in water for two doses.</p>
<p>For the external medicine, roast one liang of earthworm feces; one qian of mercury; five fen each of borneol and musk; one fen of borax; roast five qian of berberis; and three qian of catechu, grinding them into a fine powder until the mercury is undetectable. </p>
<p>Prepare a paste from this herbal powder, mixing it with vinegar, and apply it to the afflicted area. In just one day, it will be entirely resolved, exhibiting remarkable effectiveness! For any lump, treat internally and externally with this method, and the results will inevitably follow.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br>If someone develops two fingers beneath their foot, causing unbearable pain, it is due to the accumulation of damp-heat, specifically offending the spirits. Take one part borax, one tael of scallion, three parts ice fragments, and one qian of ginseng, and grind them into a powder. Lightly prick the area to draw blood, applying the powder to the spot where the fingers appear. Water will quickly flow forth; apply it to the area in a star-like pattern where the blood flows, mixing as needed until the blood has drained. If it flows for three days, it&#39;ll stop, and the pain will lessen. Next, use five qian of white atractylodes, three qian each of raw licorice, ginseng, cattle knee, spatholobus, and white mustard seed, one tael of job&#39;s tears, and one qian of pinellia. Decoct in water for four doses, which can lead to full recovery and the disappearance of the fingers as they dissolve into water. For external treatment, apply a plaster combined with skin-regenerating powder for healing.</p>

Clean the wound with strong tea before applying the paste, changing it repeatedly, and a stinging sensation is a good sign. Usually, one or two applications yield quick results, and for long-standing cases, no more than five to seven applications are needed.

<p><strong>Painful Beriberi:</strong> Each night, scrub the legs and knees with salt up to the toenails, soak for a short time, and wash with hot soup. There was a person who suffered from this illness and had success using this method.<a id="trans-321p" href="#orig-321p" class="marker">[321p]</a><br>Wind toxins causing foot disease and weakness: Use three taels of sulfur powder and five sheng of cow&#39;s milk, boil it, then steep it in water until it reaches three sheng. Take three he each time. Another method: Take three sheng of cow&#39;s milk and boil it down to one and a half sheng, mixing in one tael of sulfur powder to take. Cover well to induce sweating and avoid wind. If sweat doesn’t occur, take again. After resting and adjusting for a few days, take again. This is very effective for northern people.

<p>Use cow, sheep, or pig stomachs, remove the waste without washing, and grind into a paste. Depending on the size of the sore, add half a tael of calcined dry alum, mix uniformly, and apply on cloth and stick it on the sore. After a moment, if it itches deeply, gradually remove the cloth, heat it over the fire, and the worms will come out like countless threads of a horse&#39;s tail, either blue, white, red, or black. Wash them out with water, do this every three days for a few times, and the worms will be exhausted and the sores will heal.<a id="trans-322p" href="#orig-322p" class="marker">[322p]</a><br>When an ingrown toenail causes a sore, the nail grows into the flesh, making it impossible to wear boots. Apply burnt alum ash to it, which erodes the bad flesh and encourages the growth of healthy flesh. Carefully trim away the nail edges, and after ten days, it will heal. This remedy is remarkably effective. </p>
<p>For corns: Mix equal parts of dried alum, yellow orpiment, and vitriol into a powder, apply it, and bathe in hot water two to three times a day to heal it. </p>
<p>In cases of nail diseases that become rotten, it may be due to nail cutting injuring the skin or the nail growing into the flesh, leading to sores and swelling. This may cause yellow fluid to soak in, resulting in the fingers becoming rotten and eventually spreading up the foot, with blisters forming around the edges, as if burned by fire, causing constant pain and being unhealable by doctors. Take five liang of green vitriol, burn it until all the liquid is gone, and grind it into a powder that is yellow in color. Store it to use, washing with salt water, and apply the powder. Wrap it gently in a soft cloth, and the very same day, it will stop the fluid and dry the sore. Do this once a day, washing with salt water, ensuring any pus is cleaned out. For areas where scabs have formed, do not disturb them unless there is urgent pain, in which case apply a little butter to soothe. After three days, you will notice the scab lifting. Continue washing and applying treatment as before, and within ten days the scabs will gradually come off. If soft areas develop more white pus blisters, break them and apply the treatment, and they will naturally heal. A certain Zhang Shilang suffered from this ailment for sixty days without relief from various doctors, but found this method effective as if it were a miracle.<a id="trans-323p" href="#orig-323p" class="marker">[323p]</a><br>For a sore with pus at the edge of the toenail, where red flesh protrudes and is often lifted: Take two taels of Astragalus and one tael of (herb) and soak in vinegar overnight.

<p>For painful swelling due to toxic heat: Soak in wine with bitter salty herb.</p>
<p>For foot qi swelling and pain: Use six taels of white peony root and one tael of licorice, ground to powder, and take with white broth.</p>

If you feel unease and want to vomit, take one tael of galanga, boil with three liters of water until down to one liter, and drink it all at once to aid digestion. If that is unavailable, use one tael of fresh ginger and decoct with clear wine. Although not as effective as galanga, it will also yield good results.</p>
<p>For damp and rotten toes: Pound and apply Perilla leaves.<a id="trans-324p" href="#orig-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a><br>Knee wind pain: Use chrysanthemum and dried mugwort leaves as knee protectors; with time, they will resolve on their own. </p>

Mix this with half a bowl of cooked white rice porridge, adding four qian (a unit of weight) of the powdered medicine. Cook this mixture until well blended, keeping it thin rather than thick. Add one teaspoon of ginger juice and three large tablespoons of honey, stirring well. Consume it on an empty stomach, and it is best warm.

The spleen governs the limbs, and when wind evils invade the liver, they are mischievous towards the spleen. As the spleen is subdued by the liver, the ailment manifests in the extremities. The energy from grains attracts wind and dampness, which directly enters the spleen channel, hence providing comfort to the limbs.

<p>The Suwen says: In cases of liver heat disease, there is heated contention resulting in delirium and agitation, fullness and pain in the sides, restlessness in the hands and feet, unable to lie down peacefully. When severe, it leads to extreme sweating. Reversed qi can result in death. Needling the foot’s Jueyin and Shaoyang points is recommended. </p>
<p>In cases of kidney heat disease, there is initial pain in the lower back, acidity in the legs, thirst with frequent drinking, and fever. Heated contention leads to neck pain and stiffness, cold and sourness in the legs, with warmth below the feet and reluctance to speak. Reversed qi can lead to subtle neck pain. When severe, it causes extreme sweating. Needling the foot’s Shaoyin and Taiyang points is recommended.</p>
<p>In cases of fever disease, there is initial pain in the chest and sides, restlessness in the hands and feet; needling the foot’s Shaoyang and supplementing the foot&#39;s Taiyin are advised. For severe cases, fifty-nine needles are used. </p>
<p>For fever-related arm pain, needling the hand’s Yangming and Taiyin points helps to stop the sweating. </p>
<p>If the fever begins in the legs and shins, needling the foot’s Yangming point will help to stop the sweating. </p>
<p>The Lingshu Classic states: In January, February, and March, the human energy is in the left side, hence do not needle the Yang point of the left foot. In April, May, and June, the energy is in the right side, hence do not needle the Yang point of the right foot. In July, August, and September, the energy is again in the right side, hence do not needle the Yin point of the right foot. In October, November, and December, the energy is in the left side, hence do not needle the Yin point of the left foot.<a id="trans-364p" href="#orig-364p" class="marker">[364p]</a><br>The hand Taiyin is also called Lieque, starting at the wrist and connecting with the Taiyin channel, extending directly into the palm and dispersing into the space between the thumb and index finger.

The point is located half an inch below the wrist, connecting to the Yangming channel. </p>
<p>The hand Shaoyang is called Waiguan, located two inches above the wrist on the outer arm, leading to the chest and connecting with the heart. In cases of excess, it causes elbow stiffness; in deficiency, it results in inability to close. This point is likewise a connecting point. </p>
<p>The foot Yangming is known as Fenglong, found eight inches above the ankle, diverging from the Taiyin; its path follows the outer side of the shinbone, connecting the head, converging with the energy of various channels, and also linking to the throat. If the qi is reversed, it can cause throat obstruction and sudden loss of voice; with excess, it leads to mania, while deficiency results in inability to gather strength in the feet, causing atrophy of the shins. This point signifies a connection as well. </p>

<p>In total, there are eight moxibustion points: the first is Feng Shi point. The patient should stand upright, arms hanging down, fingers spread over both hips, and moxibustion should be applied directly on the center of the thigh muscle with the fingertip. Apply moxibustion with a hundred strong doses; for a lighter condition, do not reduce below a hundred, while for a heavier condition, it may go up to five or six hundred at one point. Do not apply all at once; give three intervals between applications for best results. </p>
<p>The second point is Fu Tu. The patient should sit cross-legged, placing their palm horizontally over the knees, with fingers pointing parallel to the bent knee. Moxibustion should be applied to the middle part of the side flesh at this location, with a hundred doses recommended, but fifty doses may also be sufficient. The third point is Du Bi.<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a><br>At the upper edge of the patella, on the outer side where the bone is flat, pressing with the hand and feeling relief indicates the spot; another source says it is below the patella, near the three outer bony protrusions where the foot moves, pressing here yields relief. Burning with moxa may require fifty to a hundred applications. </p>
<p>The fourth point is Knee Eye (Xiyan). It is located in the depressions on either side below the patella, situated in the middle. </p>
<p>The fifth point is Three Miles (Sanli). It is found five inches below the knee joint, on the outer side of the tibia; one source states it is three inches below the knee joint, depending on the size of the patient’s hand for measurement. Burn with moxa a hundred times.</p>
<p>The sixth point is Upper Margin (Shanglian). It is located one inch below Three Miles, also on the outer side of the tibia. Burn with moxa a hundred times.</p>
<p>The seventh point is Lower Margin (Xialian). It is located one inch below Upper Margin; another source mentions it is on the outer side of the tibia. Burn with moxa a hundred times.</p>
<p>The eighth point is Absolute Bone (Juegu). It is situated one inch above the outer ankle, while another source says it is four inches. </p>
<p>For all these points, burning with moxa does not need to be completed in one round; it can be done daily. Ideally, complete the required number of applications within three days.<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a><br>When there is a sickness in one foot, apply moxibustion to that foot; if both feet are afflicted, moxibustion should be done on both. Weakness in the feet often affects both legs. Additionally, if one feels discomfort in the foot, moxibustion should be applied at three cun and at the point of the bone. For afflictions in both feet, moxibustion should be performed at four locations. The number of treatments depends on the severity of the illness; even for light ailments, do not reduce the amount below one hundred applications. If the condition does not improve, continue moxibustion in order, as more is better. Some say moxibustion at the point of the bone is particularly important. If a person has weak feet and does not treat it promptly, there may be swelling in the lower abdomen or difficulty in breathing, thus requiring the application of moxibustion to various important points and joints on the abdomen and back, along with taking Baifeng Powder; often they experience healing. If the illness is felt in the abdomen and the patient is unable to bear the pain, then instead of extensive treatment, focus moxibustion on the chest, heart, abdomen, and points on both feet, where they may also achieve good recovery. The method for measuring a person&#39;s moxibustion is to cover the hand, stretching four fingers; measure up to the middle joint, where the width becomes one unit. There are two kinds of measurements; one where three fingers count as one unit, but for weak feet, use four fingers as one unit.<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a><br>The existing methods retain the old practices, including points such as Liangqiu, Dubi, Sanli, Shanglian, Xialian, Jiexi, Taichong, Yanglingquan, Juegu, Kunlun, Yinlingquan, San Yin Jiao. Originally, it included &quot;Foot Taiyin and Foot Taiyang,&quot; which are extraneous, so they are omitted. Points like Gongsun, Fulium, Rangu, Yongquan, Chengshan, Shugu, etc., total eighteen points. The old methods often involved moxibustion at Baihui, Fengfu, and the five zang and six fu points. Recently, those who practice moxibustion have noted that it commonly raises the Qi upward, which is why they no longer follow those methods. If the Qi does not stop, it can still be used. The key is that if a disease has already manifested and there are fears of no recovery, all must be treated with moxibustion. There are eight points on each foot, excluding the peculiarities of the toes, which Cao&#39;s school refers to as the &quot;Eight Chongs,&quot; effectively stimulating downward Qi. At the tips of the ten toes, called &quot;Qi Tips,&quot; apply moxibustion three times daily, which is a significant method. The Eight Chongs can be treated with moxibustion seven times a day, and the upward flow of Qi will then cease.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a><br>If the patient does not deeply understand their condition, one must be very careful not to perform moxibustion on them. Be cautious, be cautious. When moxibustion is done on the eight points of the pulse, the moxa must be made small.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Treasure Mirror of Health,&quot; for cold in the knee, the Qi Sea point is located one and a half inches below the navel, arising from the Ren vessel. The Three Mile point is located three inches below the knee, between the two tendons on the outer side of the knee; this point is where the foot yangming channel converges. It can be treated with three cones of moxa, and a needle inserted to a depth of half an inch.</p>
<p>The Three Yin Intersection point is located three inches above the inner ankle bone, in the middle of the depression below the bone; it is where the foot taiyin, shaoyin, and jueyin channels converge, and can be treated with three cones of moxa, and a needle inserted to a depth of three-tenths of an inch.</p>
<p>The Marrow Connection point is at the base of the outer ankle bone, under the auxiliary bone, and at the back knee. It is a point related to the marrow. The ancient healer Jie Gu said: If the head feels hot like fire, and the feet cold like ice, one can moxibust the Yang Auxiliary point. He also said that if the knee feels sour and cold, one can treat the Marrow Connection point.<a id="trans-388p" href="#orig-388p" class="marker">[388p]</a><br>Yangfu and Erxue are located four inches above the external malleolus, in front of the auxiliary bone and at the end of the absolute bone, about three fen away from the previous point and seven fen from Qiuxu.

Each point receives three burns, specifically at the internal and external curved intersection points. For each foot, two fires are used simultaneously, and the moxa is burned down to the flesh. Initially, pain is felt, but then two people blow until the fire goes out. Moxa is applied at noon, and once the moxa takes effect, the organs may automatically shift or rotate with a sound like thunder, leading to an immediate recovery. This method is remarkably effective and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>For the knee&#39;s tendons that cannot relax, take a point one and a half inches above the knee bend. </p>

<p>The &quot;Remarkable Efficacy of Good Remedies&quot; says: To treat a sudden cramping in the foot, stretch the foot and tightly pull it forward; the pain will then cease. The &quot;Secret Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states that for numbness in the hands and feet, place the left foot on the right knee, use the right hand to pull the left foot, and support the heel with the left hand, pulling towards the right while simultaneously turning the head. Do the same for the opposite side. In addition, engage in practices that promote the circulation of energy, utilizing the tidal flow of energy. For symptoms of both qi and blood deficiency, begin at the origin point and gradually stimulate the affected area. Rotate and twist to restore proper alignment. You can practice this while sitting, standing, or lying down. Occasionally, use your nails to pinch the numb areas—this will stimulate blood flow. For wind diseases affecting hands and feet, focus on the navel and use a breathing technique, perhaps focusing on the back, and then disperse energy throughout the limbs to alleviate pain in the joints, imagining a burning sensation. For pain in the fingers, concentrate on the afflicted area, using circular motions, and further break it down to disperse the energy. For numbness in the hands and feet, focus on rotating the navel and the Qihai point, and at night, turn over to let the water nourish Kunlun. Sweating all over and healing the limbs requires diligent practice. It is beneficial to rub both feet against each other, especially at the three yin points. For weakness in the hands and feet, first focus on the navel, then move from the Yongquan point up to the navel and back down, while crossing the energy from the left hand to the right and vice versa, performing this six times each. For burning sensations in the affected areas, push and disperse the energy while imagining washing them with water.<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a><br>Hand disease like anthrax: for the bones and joints both inside and outside the hands, imagine a fire burning them, then wash with water, and again circulate and disperse the blood vessels of the limbs. For foot sores, at the affected area, visualize and rotate multiple times, then push and disperse it, applying fire to heal it. For hand wind (a type of ailment), from the heart of the left hand, imagine fire rising and rotating to the shoulder, crossing over the heart, and reaching the heart of the right hand; do the same from the heart of the left hand. For foot qi (a condition), at the Yongquan point on the soles, where dampness enters, daily rotate and alternate the bare feet, using one hand to grip a finger and the other to rub it. When the feet feel warm after doing this many times, slightly move and curl the toes to ease it. Alternatively, someone else can rub it, but self-rubbing is preferable.<a id="trans-400p" href="#orig-400p" class="marker">[400p]</a><br>Strengthen the legs, free from weakness and pain. Accompanying this is the method of unblocking the meridians: start from the North Pole to determine the axis, spin three times. The universe encompasses everything; descend below the navel, splitting into two paths, spiraling down before the legs, connecting uninterruptedly. Move in pairs around the base of the legs, winding back towards the original sea, rising to the mingmen to converge. Rotate right, then left, spinning three times, dividing two shoulders from below the spine, passing beyond the elbows to the outer point, reaching the palms, following the inner path over the shoulder well, through the neck to the niwan, circulating down through the bright hall, gradually resting the eyes, downward to the chest cavity, gathering at the heart center. From the left, descend, spinning three times, as before splitting below the navel, circulating throughout the body, flowing and employing, during the hours of the rabbit and rooster, stopping at either nine or twenty-one degrees. Be careful not to cling; whether it is or isn&#39;t, this is called refining one&#39;s form and harmonizing one&#39;s energy.<a id="trans-401p" href="#orig-401p" class="marker">[401p]</a><br><strong>Compilation of Ancient and Modern Books - Complete Record of the Medical Section, Volume 198</strong></p>

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; states in the biography of Hua Tuo: A person, during the Qinglong period, saw the Governor of Shanyang, Liu Jingzong of Guangling. Jingzong mentioned that throughout the Zhongping era, he had met Hua Tuo several times, and that Hua Tuo&#39;s diagnosis of illnesses and his pulse examinations were as accurate as a divine revelation. </p>
<p>Liu Xun of Langye was a governor of Henei, who had a daughter nearly twenty years old. She had a sore on her left knee that was itchy but not painful. The sore would heal for several days only to reappear, this cycle continued for seven or eight years. They called in Tuo to examine her, and he said: &quot;This is easy to treat. You should acquire a yellow dog with rice husk, and two good horses. Tie the dog by the neck with a rope and let it run alongside the horses. The horses will tire quickly.&quot; </p>
<p>After running about thirty miles, the dog could not continue. They then had a person drag it for about fifty miles. Tuo then gave the girl medicine to drink, and she immediately fell asleep, unaware of her surroundings. </p>
<p>Then he took a big knife and cut the dog&#39;s belly near its hind legs, placing the cut part against the sore. He instructed them to hold it in place for two to three inches. In a moment, something resembling a snake emerged from the sore. Tuo swiftly drove an iron spike through the snake&#39;s head while it was still within the skin; it writhed for a long time before finally stopping. He then pulled it out; it was about three feet long, entirely a snake, with only eyes but no other features, and had backward scales. </p>
<p>He applied an ointment to the wound, and within seven days, it healed.<a id="trans-402p" href="#orig-402p" class="marker">[402p]</a><br>The &quot;Bingbu Shouji&quot; states: Prime Minister Wu Yuanheng, while in Xichuan, suffered from a severe leg ulcer that caused unbearable itching and pain, with numerous physicians&#39; treatments proving ineffective. Upon arriving in the capital, a clerk presented a remedy, which led to his recovery. The remedy involved crushing common purslane and applying it, only needing two or three applications.</p>
<p>The &quot;Hui Chen Lu&quot; mentions: The Yangmei of Kuaiji is the best in the world. Tong Guan suffered from athlete&#39;s foot, and some said that the kernels of Yangmei could cure it. The county magistrate, Wang Yi, gifted him fifty shi (a unit of measure), and Guan used it to achieve recovery. The kernels were prepared by mixing them with persimmon varnish, and when exposed, they cracked open naturally.</p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: An elderly man, Ma Sou, aged fifty-nine, was punished with a cane for failing to pay autumn taxes, which shock led to a long-standing condition of wind-induced spasms lasting three years. His illness manifested in violent tremors of hands and feet, rendering him unable to hold objects, requiring others to feed him, with his mouth and eyes appearing dazed, and unable to control his movements, resembling a puppet on strings, drawing crowds whenever he appeared in public. At night, he experienced fever, shedding all clothing and blankets, his body sick and itchy, alternating between internal heat and external chill. He longed for death yet lacked the strength to end his life. Seeking medical help led to financial ruin, worsening his condition. His son, a former minor official in the town, carried news of his parents&#39; illness. The doctor stated: This illness is very easy to treat. During the summer heat, with a single bout of treatment, you only need to undergo it again to be cured. Now, as autumn brings chill, it should be done three times.<a id="trans-403p" href="#orig-403p" class="marker">[403p]</a><br>If there is no improvement, further needling of the Yu point will surely bring healing. First, use the Tongsheng powder to induce sweating, then take the Yongji medicine, which will cause the expulsion of one to two liters of phlegm. By evening, another five to seven passages will be released, and the illness will be somewhat relieved. Wait five days before administering another expulsion, leading to the discharge of three to four liters of phlegm, resembling clumped chicken fat and appearing hot like soup. The elderly man, trembling and unable to probe himself, had his wife assist him; his throat and neck were swollen, and he felt dazed as if intoxicated. After about one or two hours, he gradually awakened and expelled a few more passages, immediately feeling lighter and less tremulous, with the heat also subsiding. He was able to walk again, use his hands for grooming, and handle utensils. Before the third expulsion was reached, the illness vanished as if washed away, leaving him feeling extremely cold. The physician said: He should be supplemented with food, and in time, he will recover. The reason is that after a severe illness, the defensive qi has not yet returned, thus it is advisable to use medicines that disperse wind and guide qi; one must not use warming medications, for that could lead to other ailments.</p>
<p>An elderly man from Huangru, with both hands trembling, appeared as if he were sawing; he couldn’t cover himself with a blanket in winter. While treating a patient in Wuyang, I passed through Huangru and did not apply medication but needled the middle point behind the thumbs on both hands. The physician remarked: From the elbows upward, there are no ailments, solely the trembling in the hands, which is what the leftist refers to as wind-induced minor illness. Alternatively, needling the Houbie point, which corresponds to the hand&#39;s Taiyang point, and bending the little finger to where the lines converge is also a significant point.<a id="trans-404p" href="#orig-404p" class="marker">[404p]</a><br>A young boy from the Li family suffered from spasms in his hands and feet, signifying the influence of a spirit. The spirit said: &quot;This is caused by excessive heart fire; do not restrain his hands. He should go through the spasms.&quot; This was due to the nurse&#39;s improper cradling. They then cleaned the ground, sprinkled it with water, and re-sprinkled it until it was thoroughly wet, placing the child face down on the ground for a long time. The child turned and rolled, getting completely muddy, and they washed him with water. After a while, he was cured.</p>
<p>Another patient, a tax official, experienced pain from wind, cold, and dampness, feeling heavy and swollen in the waist and legs, suffering greatly at night. His feet were unbearably cold, and for five to six months, he still wore cotton socks. The skin on his knees and feet was minimally exposed; when cold wind touched it, it penetrated his meridians, worsening his condition, with pain fluctuating and shifting unpredictably. In the area of greatest pain, there would be spasms and swelling, but the flesh color remained unchanged, with the skin feeling like it had bugs crawling beneath it. Whenever exposed to wind and cold, his illness would surely worsen. His appetite decreased, and his body became weak and thin, requiring assistance to walk or stand. He had taken various warming herbs and moxibustion, but to no avail for three years.</p>
<p>One day, I examined his pulse; both hands were heavy, slippery, and strong. I first administered one dose each of Water Conduit Pill and Meridian Passage Powder. That night, he had over thirty bowel movements, and his pain was reduced by half. Gradually, he took Red Poria Decoction, Chuanxiong Decoction, and Fangfeng Decoction, which are prescribed in the &quot;Xuanming Lun&quot; for treating bi syndrome. He took these three remedies three times a day, boiled at seven to eight qian, and soon began to sweat lightly. Following that, through a process of steam treatment using a delicate stove, he was cured.<a id="trans-405p" href="#orig-405p" class="marker">[405p]</a><br>In Yinggao, Han Jiqing suffered from damp sores from his thighs to his feet, with the larger ones resembling coins and the smaller ones like beans. They itched, causing him to scratch them open; when water touched them, they became soaked and resembled insects crawling on socks. Even after healing, they would recur, leaving pits as scars, and for over ten years, he could not recover. A certain physician remarked, saying: &quot;These are damp sores. They arise from moisture, hence they are often found on the lower parts of the body. With boats and carts, one travels over ten miles, and it&#39;s as if they have been swept away.&quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongwen, the liquor supervisor from Guyang Town, visited a temple and noticed that the workman had built a lookout platform about four feet high. While climbing down, he twisted one foot, causing swelling around the outer ankle, with a heat and pain like fire. One doctor intended to use a needle (gold not being suitable) to prick the swollen area to release blood. But another physician urgently stopped him, saying: &quot;The pain from the twist is already severe; to inflict a needle prick would cause double the pain. How can one endure that?&quot; Hence, he administered Shenyou pills, around eighty or ninety, and instructed him to abstain from hot foods. </p>
<p>At midnight, the swollen area became itchy, the pain subsided, and he could walk normally again. The physician said: &quot;My method has healed all ten cases, I do not deceive future generations.&quot;<a id="trans-406p" href="#orig-406p" class="marker">[406p]</a><br>Zhongming&#39;s wife, whenever winter comes, experiences a burning pain in her hands. A physician said: &quot;The limbs are the foundation of all Yang energy. In summer, they disperse and there&#39;s no pain, but when autumn and winter arrive, they contract and thus cause pain.&quot; He treated her with the Sanhua Shen&#39;you pill and she was cured.</p>
<p>In Yancheng, there lived a man named Liang Jia, who was over sixty. One morning, he woke up and began to comb his hair, only to find that the fingers of his left hand were numb. Soon, half of his arm became numb, then the other arm, and shortly after, the upper half of his head. By the time he finished combing, he felt numbness from his side down to his feet. He hadn’t had a proper bowel movement for two or three days. He consulted other doctors, who all said it was due to wind; whether through medicine or acupuncture, none provided relief, so he sought treatment from the physician. </p>
<p>The physician examined him and said: &quot;The three pulse points in your left arm are faint, being three times smaller than those of your right. This is not merely due to wind; there is also a combination of dryness caused by heat.&quot; He prescribed methods of expelling along with purging and sweating, and the numbness immediately subsided. Later, he used warm and moistening medications to treat the dryness, but the little and ring fingers remained numb. The physician said: &quot;The root of the illness is gone; this is just residual heat.&quot; Only then was it appropriate to perform acupuncture at the Xigu point, which is the space of the bones. </p>
<p>On a sunny and mild day, he went to perform the acupuncture, using the technique from the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; involving the chicken foot method—he inserted the needle while the patient was lying upward, applying it three times, then withdrew it and inserted it while lying downward. The numbness throughout the fingers was relieved, and the hand felt as hot as fire. The numbness completely disappeared. In the past, Liu Hejian wrote the &quot;Yuan Bing Shi,&quot; often associating numbness with dryness, truly a connoisseur of understanding ailments.<a id="trans-407p" href="#orig-407p" class="marker">[407p]</a><br>In the summer of Yang, a woman from the Hu family had cracked hands and feet, and her eyes were dim. The physician said: &quot;This is caused by wind affecting the liver.&quot; He also said: &quot;The sounds of resonance and disturbances are both manifestations of wind. Wind belongs to wood, and when wood is congested, it must be released.&quot; He meant that it needs to be expelled. First, he ordered an emetic, and then prescribed a modified Gui Pi Decoction with Angelica to drain it, which had immediate effect.</p>
<p>A maidservant of the physician had frostbite on her feet. The physician instructed her to take Zhuo Che Pill and Jun Chuan Powder, leading to a significant purge, and she recovered. Some questioned this. The physician replied: &quot;When the heart fire is reduced, the cold below dissipates; what is there to doubt?&quot;<a id="trans-408p" href="#orig-408p" class="marker">[408p]</a><br>Mr. Ma&#39;s brother was bitten by a dog while in the village. He was carried home, and his leg swelled up like a jar, as hard as iron or stone. Poison entered, causing him to vomit and preventing food from staying down, along with a heavy headache. He went to consult a healer. The young maid said, &quot;The pain follows the reduction in benefits; use betel nut pills to expel it.&quot; There were two excretions, but it did not improve. Just then, the healer returned from Wuyang and said to Ma, &quot;With such swelling, can the three yin and three yang of the foot be unblocked?&quot; Ma replied, &quot;Neither can be unblocked.&quot; The healer asked, &quot;Then why not use a strong purge?&quot; He ordered that night to take one hundred and fifty pills of Zhuoche, along with three or four qian of Tongjing San. By midnight, there were fourteen excretions, and the swelling immediately subsided, leaving a walnut-patterned skin, even thinner than the uninjured leg. The healer cautioned, &quot;Be careful not to apply a plaster, as it must allow the poisoned fluids to flow out; the purulent blood and water should continue to move.&quot; Another day, fearing the poison had not yet fully dissipated, he took over a hundred more pills of Zhuoche, along with three or four qian of Junchuan San, resulting in six excretions. The patient said, &quot;Fourteen excretions are easy to manage, but six are unexpectedly difficult; why is this?&quot; The healer replied, &quot;When the illness is severe, it overcomes the medicine; when the illness is milder, it cannot withstand the medicine.&quot; On the sixth day, the purulent water was completely gone. The healer stated, &quot;While the purulent water flows, do not fear the wind; after it is gone, fear the wind.&quot; He then used a wind-canceling cake, taking it three times a day. After another two days, he finally applied a wound-healing powder, and it formed a scab. Alas! The use of medicine varies and makes a significant difference. If he had not seen the healer, the advice on reduction of benefits would not have been accurate. This shows that even recognizing the need for a doctor is difficult, let alone actually using one.<a id="trans-409p" href="#orig-409p" class="marker">[409p]</a><br>Mr. Ma&#39;s wife fell ill, her pain was unbearable. A penny&#39;s worth of a medicinal wine was mixed to relieve her symptoms, and in the middle of the night, she vomited; after vomiting, her pain lessened. I lamented, saying: &quot;I once saw Chen Wu suffering from a similar condition; the doctor thought it was caused by small insects, or perhaps she had touched something toxic on the grass, and her affliction lingered for several months, only recovering when the pus was entirely expelled. Looking back on it now, it is laughable.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there was a gentleman who suffered from severe pain in his waist and hips, making it difficult for him to walk or ride. Some treated it as a case of athlete&#39;s foot due to cold and damp, while others thought it was a deficiency. Herbs like black, aconite, myrrh, and others that invigorate blood and strengthen bones were all employed. After more than sixty days, his eyes were red and he was overheated; both his urination and defecation were not normal, and his waist and hip pain remained unchanged. A physician examined both his hands; the pulses were all deep and slow. The deep pulse indicated a problem within, so it was appropriate to drain it. He took a dose of Zhuoche Pills and Junquan Powder, eliminating over twenty blockages. By morning, after consuming a few bowls of scallion porridge, he was helped onto a horse and was already able to appear refreshed.<a id="trans-410p" href="#orig-410p" class="marker">[410p]</a><br>Li Shibolang from Tangxi had been suffering from a back ailment for several years, unable to fully extend his large feet and walking in a hunched, limping manner. Medications had proven ineffective and only seemed to worsen his condition. One autumn evening, after crossing water, his illness flared up again. The doctor prescribed him a medicinal pill weighing four pounds. His father, Li Zhong&#39;an, then requested medicine from Mr. Dai. Mr. Dai asked, &quot;What medication has he been taking recently?&quot; Zhong&#39;an replied, &quot;The four-pound pill.&quot; Mr. Dai then asked, &quot;Are your eyes feeling dim and red?&quot; The father was startled and responded, &quot;His eyes are severely swollen.&quot; Mr. Dai said, &quot;You must come quickly; if you do not, he will lose his sight.&quot; When they finally arrived, he walked with a cane, unable to see because of the swelling in his eyes. Mr. Dai first instructed them to induce vomiting, after which he expelled a large quantity of pills, and suddenly his vision cleared. He discarded the cane. After further purging, he was able to read official documents within a month. He was then prescribed Angelica pills and was able to walk home with ease.<a id="trans-411p" href="#orig-411p" class="marker">[411p]</a><br>The &quot;Ten Books of the Eastern Garden&quot; states: In the winter of the Gui Mao year, during heavy snowfall, Dong Jianjun from Ling Shou County went to Zhen Ding for some affairs and suddenly felt a strong wind blowing. Upon examination, he found all six pulse positions to be taut, and pressing revealed a strong and forceful pulse. The symptoms included sudden spasms of the hands, constipation, and a red, hot face, indicating an onset of wind-cold attacking the body. The four limbs correlate with the spleen; if wind and cold evil affect it, then there will be spasms and pain, showing that wind is the superficial ailment while cold exists on the exterior. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that cold causes muscle contractions, which directly relates to this situation. The patient, who regularly drank alcohol, had damp heat accumulating in his intestines and stomach, leading to constipation and a red, hot face. Internally, the hands and feet are afflicted by Yangming (the Yangming meridian), while externally, the Taiyin spleen meridian is suffering from the wind-cold evil. Therefore, I used cinnamon and licorice to expel the cold evil and ease the spasms. Also, using the bitter and cold properties of bitter coptis to purge heat and moisten dryness, I urgently rescued the kidney water. I applied angelica and kudzu to uplift Yang energy and mobilize the meridians of the hands and feet without obstruction. Additionally, I used cinnamon, which is spicy and warm, to guide into the hand Yangming meridian. To replenish the spleen&#39;s energy and prevent the invasion of wind-cold, I added peony and licorice specifically to nourish the spleen’s Qi, thus suppressing the wood evil and benefiting the lung&#39;s metal. I included ginseng to boost the innate Qi as an auxiliary treatment, along with angelica to relieve internal urgency while harmonizing the blood and moistening dryness. The chief formula is the Blood Activating and Meridian Opening Decoction.<a id="trans-412p" href="#orig-412p" class="marker">[412p]</a><br>In the spring of the Year of the Snake, when Lian Pingzhang was thirty-eight years old, he suffered from a condition marked by body and limbs swelling slightly with redness. His feet and shins were red and swollen, causing unbearable pain. He did not dare lean on a walking stick; when he touched his skin, the pain intensified. He would rise only to lie back down, struggling day and night, unable to describe his suffering, and sought my treatment.</p>
<p>Due to the high, cold northern lands, he had consumed much alcohol over time, damaging his spleen and hindering its ability to process food and drink, resulting in this condition. I prescribed him a decoction of Angelica to relieve pain, and his pain was reduced by half. After a second dose, the swelling and pain completely disappeared, leaving only slight redness and swelling in the tips of his right-hand fingers. I used a three-edged needle to prick the tips of his fingers, and much vile blood was released, fully eliminating the redness and swelling. </p>
<p>A few days later, after eating moist food, he experienced pain in his limbs again, so I treated him with a decoction of bitter orange and rhubarb. The ailment, foot edema, is caused by excessive water and dampness. The face gathers this dampness, obstructing the blood&#39;s circulation and resulting in aching limbs and joints. The Inner Canon states: wind can overcome dampness. Qianghuo, being aromatic and warm, penetrates the joints to expel dampness, hence it is used primarily. When blood stagnates and cannot flow, pain ensues, and Angelica&#39;s warming qualities disperse the obstruction and alleviate pain. The bitter and cold nature of bitter orange treats distention and aids in digestion, thus it serves as an adjunct. Rhubarb, being bitter and cold, guides out the damp heat from the face and treats all accumulated blood clots, acting decisively, which is why it is included as an envoy in this formulation.<a id="trans-413p" href="#orig-413p" class="marker">[413p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: If the soles of the feet feel sharp pain like being pricked with a needle, or if there is swelling in the ankles, and the wrists also feel painful and swollen, accompanied by urgent diarrhea, this indicates a deficiency of blood, and that the lower body has been affected by dampness, thereby causing illness; the remedy is the Jianbu Pill.</p>
<p>There was a villager who was hunched and had cramping legs, rendering him unable to work. I examined his pulse and found both hands to be heavy and tight, so I administered the Renyuan Renal Decoction. He experienced vomiting and diarrhea for over a month, alternating between the two. After three applications of this, he finally recovered.</p>
<p>Sir Cheng, in his life, always felt heat in his feet below the ankles, and could not add cotton to them in winter. He once remarked, &quot;I am robust and not afraid of the cold.&quot; I replied, &quot;This is due to deficiency in the three yin meridians of your feet; it would be best to stop excessive activities and nurture your yin and blood, which might help you avoid problems.&quot; He only smiled and did not respond. He was merely seventeen years old when he succumbed to atrophy and died six months later.<a id="trans-414p" href="#orig-414p" class="marker">[414p]</a><br>The &quot;Hygienic Treasure&quot; states: Zhang Danian from Zhen Ding Prefecture, at the age of twenty-nine, had a strong fondness for alcohol. During the fifth month of the year Xinyi (the 13th year of the Yuan dynasty), he suffered from swelling and pain in his finger joints, making flexion and extension difficult; his knees were similarly affected. He felt a fullness in his chest, a heaviness throughout his body, a lack of desire to eat, and when he did eat, he felt the urge to vomit. His complexion was pale yellow, and his energy was diminished. In June, he came seeking treatment from me. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be deep and slow; a slow pulse indicates spleen issue. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that the body is heavy with joint pain. The spleen governs the arms and legs; due to his long history of drinking, combined with the current excessive dampness, the moisture flowed to his limbs, causing the swelling and pain. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all dampness causing swelling and pain is related to the spleen soil. Zhong Jing mentions: “When dampness flows into the joints, the limbs become painful”—this refers to that situation. He should be treated with the major Qianghuo Decoction. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; further states: &quot;When dampness lingers internally, treat with bitter warmth, disperse it with bitterness and drain it with lightness.&quot; It also says: &quot;Wind can overcome dampness.&quot; Qianghuo and Duhuo are spicy and warm, penetrating the joints to overcome dampness, thus they are the monarch herbs. Shengma is bitter and neutral; Weilingxian, Fangfeng, and Cangzhu are bitter, spicy, and warm, making them dispersing ministers. If blood is stagnant and not flowing, add Danggui, which is spicy and warm to disperse it. Licorice is sweet and warm, benefiting qi and warming the center; Zexie is salty and neutral, Fuling is sweet and neutral, guiding dampness and benefiting urination, thus draining it with lightness. This harmonizes the flavors, allowing for dispersion of dampness both upwards and downwards.<a id="trans-415p" href="#orig-415p" class="marker">[415p]</a><br>Zhongshu Nianhe was forty years old, sturdy in build. In the spring of the year of Bingchen, he journeyed to the eastern part of Yangzhou. Suddenly, he experienced a surge of symptoms in his feet, with swelling throughout his body, causing pain so severe that he could not approach them. The pain in his legs was especially intense, making it impossible for him to wear shoes. He rode on horseback with his feet barely resting in the stirrups, using a bamboo container to manage the situation, and urgently came to seek help.</p>
<p>I recalled that the &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;Dampness begins within and manifests as swelling outside.&quot; Furthermore, it says: &quot;All pains are due to excess.&quot; If the blood is excessive, it should be drained. I used a three-edged needle to pierce the swollen area several times, and blood gushed out, rising more than two feet, gradually flowing out like a thread, totaling about half a liter, with a purple-black color. Shortly after, the swelling subsided and the pain decreased. I prescribed a dose of Danggui Nian Tong decoction, weighing about one and a half liang, for him to take. That night, he was able to sleep, and after taking it again the next day, he was cured. &quot;Bencao&quot; mentions that certain treatments can dispel obstruction and promote flow. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that internal dampness should be treated with bitter and warming remedies.<a id="trans-416p" href="#orig-416p" class="marker">[416p]</a><br>Qianghuo is bitter and pungent, penetrating the joints to dispel dampness. Fangfeng and licorice warm and scatter the dampness flowing in the meridians, thus they are used as the main herbs. Water has a moistening property; Shengma and Gegen are bitter and pungent, with a thin flavor that leads the yang within the yin upward, allowing it to emerge through bitterness. Baizhu is bitter, sweet, and warm, harmonizing the stomach and overpowering dampness. Cangzhu is light and buoyant, with a strong energy that can eliminate dampness from the skin and pores, thus it is used as an assistant. When the blood is stagnant and not flowing, it causes pain; Danggui is warm and pungent, dispersing it to ensure that blood and qi return to their proper places. Renshen and licorice are sweet and warm, tonifying the spleen and stomach, nurturing the righteous qi so that bitter medications do not harm the stomach. Zhòngjīng says that when dampness and heat combine, the limbs and joints experience pain. Ku Shen, Huangqin, Zhim mu, and Yinchén are bitter and cold, serving to drain excess. All are prepared and stir-fried for use. If treatment does not facilitate urination, it is not effective. Zhū líng is sweet, warm, and neutral, while Zexie is salty and neutral, mild enough to promote diuresis and also capable of guiding out retained fluids, thus they are used as aids. The properties of the herbs harmonize to disperse dampness, allowing the stagnant qi to circulate freely.<a id="trans-417p" href="#orig-417p" class="marker">[417p]</a><br>The Deputy Marshal of Southern Expeditions, Da Te Mu Er, was sixty-eight years old. In the autumn of the Wuxu year, I accompanied him on a campaign southward. Passing ten miles beyond Yangzhou, it was mid-winter, and I fell ill. My digestion was poor, my abdomen was cold and painful, my lower legs felt icy, and I could not feel any pain or itch when I scratched myself. I attempted to warm myself by burning stones, but it did not help. I examined my pulse, which was deep, thin, and weak. Considering my condition, I realized that at such an advanced age and with a weak constitution, entering enemy territory, facing the urgent demands of warfare, along with the cold of night and day, disrupted eating habits and excessive consumption of dairy products had weakened my vitality. Walking on damp ground had allowed cold and dampness to invade my body, leading to my discomfort. The “Inner Canon” states: When afflicted by cold, one may experience mild symptoms such as a cough, or more severe manifestations like diarrhea and pain. This results from a combination of cold and dampness causing illness. Therefore, the proper course of action is to quickly dispel the cold and dampness, and strongly invigorate the Yang energy; moxibustion is necessary to remedy the illness. First, I applied moxa sticks to the Qi Hai point, doing it a hundred times to bolster the Yang energy in the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-418p" href="#orig-418p" class="marker">[418p]</a><br>For the treatment of coldness in the knee and its reversal, and to guide the yang energy downward, moxibustion is applied to the three miles and two points, each with three seven-sticks. Additionally, moxibustion is used on the three yin junctions to dispel the cold and dampness affecting the feet. Therefore, the prescription states that cold invasion should be treated with warming, pungent herbs, while exterior dampness should be addressed with bitter and hot herbs, which are released by bitterness.</p>
<p>For this, Aconite is the chief herb, being greatly warming and pungent, aiding yang and dispelling yin, warming the meridians and scattering cold. Dried Ginger and Cinnamon are also highly warming and pungent, dispelling cold dampness; White Atractylodes and Pinellia are bitter, pungent, warm, and dry dampness from the spleen, thus they serve as deputies. Ginseng, Cardamom, and roasted Licorice are sweet and pungent, greatly warming, nourishing the middle and benefiting qi; Fresh Ginger is pungent and warm, dispelling the clear dampness; Green Onions are pungent and warm, facilitating the upward flow of yang energy, thus they serve as assistants.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is said: to nourish and treat descending issues should be done urgently; when urgent, the flavor of the remedy is rich, hence a substantial dose should be taken. After several doses, the diarrhea stops and the pain diminishes, the knee gradually warms, and dietary adjustments are made, stabilizing by over ten days. The following autumn, while passing through Xiangyang, amidst a prolonged rainy season, the previous symptoms reoccurred. Again, moxibustion was done as before and additional yang-supporting treatments were administered with three seven-sticks each. After several doses of the previous remedy, a good recovery was achieved.<a id="trans-419p" href="#orig-419p" class="marker">[419p]</a><br>On the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month in the year of Renwu (1282), Wang Bolu, who was over fifty-seven years old, had a swollen right arm extending from his shoulder to his fingertips. The skin turned cool, and the six pulses were deep, thin, and faint. This indicated that both the pulse and symptoms were cold. I referred him to the abscess specialist Sun Yanhe for examination. He stated, &quot;This is an abscess on the bone, and the opening has been delayed.&quot; He proposed to use a cautery needle to open it, which would allow for clear and thin pus to be released. </p>
<p>The next day, I reopened beneath the elbow, as there was persistent nausea; Yanhe prescribed two doses of a remedy made from cloves and persimmon stems, which brought some relief. However, the next day, the nausea worsened significantly, accompanied by diarrhea, cold pain in the navel and abdomen, a feeling of fullness, reduced appetite, and occasional dizziness. Over the dark area beneath the left breast, I performed moxibustion for two or seven times and used Tuo Li Wen Zhong Tang, which included dried ginger, aconite, wood fragrance, sandalwood, fennel, and Qianghuo, grinding one and a half taels for administration.<a id="trans-420p" href="#orig-420p" class="marker">[420p]</a><br>It is said: All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers relate to heart fire, especially during times of intense heat. Can dry ginger and aconite be used then? I responded: It is only natural; it must be so. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: If the pulse is fine and the skin is cold, with diarrhea before and after, and food does not enter, this is called the five vacuities. Moreover, if one consumes counterproductive foods, it is due to the stomach being vacuous and cold. All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers belong to heart fire, which explains the diagnosis. This condition contradicts internal and external signs; therefore, one must follow the signs rather than the time. If not treated urgently with strong, hot formulas, it cannot be cured. Thus, after administering the treatment, all symptoms disappeared, appetite doubled, the sores were warm, and the pus was normal. Yan He again used the Five Spice Decoction several times, and after more than a month, recovery was achieved. Ah! Sticking to the usual is the perspective of the common people, while understanding change is the work of the wise. Many know the usual but fail to understand the changes, and thus suffer losses over trivial matters, not to mention in medicine!

He then went into the mountains to search and, indeed, found it; it was the herb Wei Ling Xian. After taking it, the individual was able to walk after a few days. Later, a mountain man named Deng Si Ji learned of it and recorded the method, stating: Harvest the herb, dry it in the shade for over a month, pound and sieve it, then mix two qian with warm clear wine, taking it on an empty stomach. If the person’s natural constitution is strong against the medicine, the dosage can be increased to six qian. If the purging effect becomes too strong, reduce the dosage, and stop taking it once the illness is cured. Its nature is very gentle; it does not interact negatively with other medicines, but it should be avoided with tea and wheat soup; instead, licorice and gardenia can be used as substitutes for drinks.<a id="trans-422p" href="#orig-422p" class="marker">[422p]</a><br>A man frequently sweats from his hands and feet; treatments with various herbs such as Qín, Lián, Zhī, and Yè, along with tonics, proved ineffective.

<p>Sun Shaofu diagnosed Han Yanzheng, who had suddenly fallen ill, leaving him unable to raise his hands or feet.

After several doses, he recovered.</p>
<p>A man nearing thirty was accustomed to rich flavors and was often irritable. In autumn, he began to feel pain in his hip joints, radiating to the knees, with daytime relief but night pain worsening, accompanied by chills, intermittent thirst, and variable abdominal discomfort. Many doctors prescribed wind medications and tonics for blood. By the following spring, his knees began to swell, and the pain intensified, causing a decline in appetite and noticeable emaciation. By late spring, his knees were swollen like peaches and could not bend or stretch. Upon examining his pulse, the left side was considerably full and tight, while the Cun pulse was weak, indicating frequent and scanty urination. Thus, he was treated for accumulation of phlegm in the Yangming channel via food therapy.<a id="trans-423p" href="#orig-423p" class="marker">[423p]</a><br>Stir-fry one tael of Coptis, and three qian each of fresh licorice tops, powdered rhinoceros horn, and salt-fried Atractylodes.

Each dose of three qian should be ground thoroughly with natural ginger juice, and enough water to create a suspension. Boil until it reaches a rolling boil, then drink it hot before meals, four times a day for one full day. After half a month, the pulse gradually weakens and the pain becomes lighter. Remove the rhinoceros horn and add half a tael of cow-horn and half a tael of soft turtle shell, taking it as before. After another half month, the swelling reduces, food intake increases, and there is no aversion to cold, but only mild soreness in the feet and knees, making it difficult to stand or walk for long periods. Then, from the previous recipe, remove Atractylodes and Scutellaria. In warm summer, add one and a half taels of stir-fried Coptis. I suggest adding cow-horn to the original formula, using stems and leaves in spring and summer, and the roots in winter, extracting the juice for use, which is very effective. It is essential to avoid alcohol, meat, damp foods, and pepper. In mid-summer, add half a tael of raw Rehmannia, and in winter, add Euphoria and cinnamon twig.

<p>There was a scholar named Shang who suffered from kidney deficiency due to chronic labor, resulting in weakness in his legs and inability to walk, later losing his ability to speak, and having a dark complexion. I diagnosed him with cold kidney qi unable to circulate, and treated him with Di Huang Yin Zi, leading to improvement. However, he later compromised his recovery and relapsed. I prescribed Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan and similar remedies, encountering fever and phlegm suggesting a stroke. To counteract wind and phlegm, I also treated him for constipation with dry mouth and tongue. I continued with the previous decoction plus adjustments of Ba Wei Wan, gradually improving, and eventually administered Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to ensure complete recovery.<a id="trans-425p" href="#orig-425p" class="marker">[425p]</a><br>A man with weak vital energy often experienced dizziness, fatigue, and heat in his limbs. In the midsummer, due to labor and irregular diet, he suffered from numbness in his hands and overall weakness. I believed that the summer heat had harmed his vital energy, so I treated him with a ginseng tonifying decoction, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Governor Han Tingyi initially suffered from wind symptoms, which improved with medications that dispelled wind, transformed phlegm, and nourished blood. However, he later experienced heat and pain in the bones of his legs and knees, and after taking the Shimei Guben Pills and Tianma Pills, his condition worsened. His pulse was rapid but weak. I deduced that his kidney water was deficient and could not nourish the liver wood, causing internal heat to arise, and this was not caused by external wind. Doubting my diagnosis, he took wind-dispelling pills like Qianghuo Yufeng Dan, which left him with weak limbs, widespread numbness, and phlegm rising, clouding his mind. I stated that his spleen energy was depleted, unable to nourish his entire body and failing to regulate the phlegm. I first administered several doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction augmented with Chuanxiong, Angelica, and cardamom to strengthen his spleen energy and regulate phlegm. Then I provided several doses of the Eight Treasure Decoction to support the transformative energy of the five organs and nourish his entire body, and gradually his symptoms improved. He then took the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction in the morning to tonify the spleen and lungs, and the Liuwei Dihuang Pills in the evening to nourish the liver and kidneys. After about three months of this regimen, he was stable.<a id="trans-426p" href="#orig-426p" class="marker">[426p]</a><br>Madam Jin, the elder, initially experienced chest and side pain, followed by an inability to control her limbs, sweating profusely, involuntary urination, and unformed stools. Her mouth was tight and her eyes twitched, while her appetite was relatively good. After more than ten days, some suspected it was an issue with her internal organs, causing great worry. I said: Not so. If the wind had indeed entered the internal organs, and the true qi had already been depleted, severe symptoms would have manifested immediately, and disaster would have been at hand. How could one delay it? </p>
<p>I examined her complexion; her face was both red and sometimes blue. Upon checking her pulse, the left three positions were surging and rapid, especially the liver position was most pronounced. I stated: The chest and breast pain indicates a deficiency of blood in the liver meridian, leading to stagnant liver qi. The inability to control the limbs is due to the liver&#39;s blood deficiency, which cannot nourish the sinews. The persistent sweating indicates wind-heat in the liver, causing erratic fluid loss. The involuntary urination results from extreme heat in the liver meridian, leading to failure in the function of the yin. The unformed stools reflect a fierce liver wood overpowering the spleen earth. </p>
<p>I then administered four doses of Xijiao San, and all symptoms improved immediately. I also used jiawei xiaoyao san (modified_free_and_easy_pill) to regulate and stabilize her condition. Later, due to frustration and anxiety, her previous symptoms recurred, accompanied by fever and vomiting, a reduced appetite, and persistent menstruation. This indicated that wood was overly vigorous, constraining the earth, which prevented the spleen from retaining blood. I utilized jiawei guipi tang (modified return-to-spleen decoction) as the main remedy, supplemented with xiaoyao san, to regulate and replenish the qi of the liver and spleen, purifying and harmonizing the blood of the liver and spleen, leading to her recovery. Subsequently, whenever she was angered or during her sleep, she experienced spasms in her hands and feet, and upon using the previous remedies, she would recover immediately.<a id="trans-427p" href="#orig-427p" class="marker">[427p]</a><br>A woman had an overdue menstruation, and due to excessive labor and anger, her limbs could not bend, a condition called &quot;Zou Zheng.&quot; This was due to blood deficiency being attacked by wind and heat. She was first treated with Ba Zhen Tang, adding Diao Teng Gou and Chai Hu, which gradually improved her condition. She was further assisted with Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, which helped her recover.</p>
<p>The Minister Liu Ziyan, due to overwork, suffered from softness and pain in the lower body, along with heat and phlegm accumulation. He took Qing Zao Tang with Zhu Li and ginger juice, which reduced his heat and pain by half. After another dose, he fully recovered.</p>
<p>My teacher, Yu Xian Gao, returned from Datong and said to me: &quot;I have developed a wind disease.&quot; His legs felt weak and lacked strength, and labor caused sharp pains like iron needles, with a pulse that was strong and rapid. I informed him that this was due to liver and kidney yin deficiency with excessive fire. The weakness and lack of strength were signs of true illness, while the piercing pain was a manifestation of pathogenic fire. He was treated with a remedy to strengthen water and nourish the kidneys, leading to recovery. The gentleman remarked: &quot;While residing in the government residence, everyone believed it was wind, regretting the lack of medicine. If I had taken wind remedies, how could it be this way? How fortunate I am.&quot; I secretly believe that previous cases were often misdiagnosed as wind diseases, and hastily treating them with dispersing methods often worsened critical situations.<a id="trans-428p" href="#orig-428p" class="marker">[428p]</a><br>A woman with a history of blood deficiency, after great labor, experienced heat in her legs and afternoon fever, with a delayed menstrual period. She sometimes used Si Wu (Four Substance Decoction), Qin (Scutellaria), and Lian (Coptis), and had little appetite with thoughts about food. She had a feeling of fullness in her chest and was vomiting phlegm, for which I advised Er Chen (Two Aged) Decoction, along with zhishi (bitter orange) and huanglian (Coptis). Her bowel movements were not firm, and she was vomiting phlegm excessively, with pain in her heels. I said: the heat in the legs and afternoon fever, along with the delayed menstrual period, indicate deficieny in both liver and spleen blood. The chest fullness and phlegm, along with lack of appetite, suggest deficiency in spleen and stomach qi. The stomach is the foundation of the five organs; when its qi is deficient, all diseases manifest. I first used Bu Zhong Yi Qi (Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi) with addition of Fu Ling (Poria) and Ban Xia (Pinellia), gradually strengthening her spleen and stomach, and then added Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill) to nourish the spleen and kidney. Within two months, she recovered.</p>
<p>A man had weakness and softness in his legs, with afternoon fever. I said: this is due to deficiency in the three yin of the legs, and he should take Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Zi Shen Er Wan (Two Pills for Kidney Nourishment) to nourish it. A woman had weakness in her legs and fatigue when laboring. I said: the limbs are related to earth, and this indicates spleen deficiency. She should take Bu Zhong Yi Qi and the Yao Shao Dan (Youth Preservation Pill) to manage it. None followed my advice, each insisting on using Sou Feng (Searching Wind) and Tian Ma (Gastrodia) pills, and both ended up failing.<a id="trans-429p" href="#orig-429p" class="marker">[429p]</a><br>I have always enjoyed sitting and reading, but after a long time I feel weary. I must take supplements to replenish my energy, adding wheat gluten and five flavors, with a little bit of wine-fried black yellowbark, before I feel mentally clear and proper. Otherwise, I will have trouble sleeping at night, my feet feel sour and hot, and if I cannot sleep for a long time, my legs feel the same. Additionally, the muscles in my legs seem to tighten, causing them to move restlessly left and right, turning in discomfort. I will only fall asleep when exhaustion finally overcomes me, which harms my vital energy and allows Yin fire to invade. </p>
<p>In the year Ding You, at the age of fifty-one, there was a feeling of something stuck between my teeth, causing swelling and discomfort. At times, my tongue would feel as if there were sores. This condition worsened in the afternoons, and if I slept for a long time or took previous medicine, I might find some relief. By the time of Xin Chou, at age fifty-five, the swelling continued between my teeth during the day. After taking a dose of the energy-replenishing supplement, I was able to sleep at night. However, in the year Ren Yin, there were internal troubles, and although I took the previous medicine, the swelling still occurred at night, particularly worsening before noon, when my teeth and body felt somewhat healthier. In the afternoon, however, the swelling returned, indicating that my blood and energy were declining and that the treatment needed to be adjusted.</p>
<p>A scholar who enjoyed consuming excessively hot foods and drinks throughout the four seasons, sometimes experienced sour belching or inconsistent stools, and had itching between his toes. This indicated a deficiency of the spleen and a cold sinking condition, which was treated successfully with a modified Six Gentlemen Decoction adding ginger and cinnamon. If there were any minor missteps in diet, the ailments would recur. With additional doses of the previous medicine along with a little aconite, the problems would not arise again.<a id="trans-430p" href="#orig-430p" class="marker">[430p]</a><br>A man, feeling fatigued in body, eating and drinking moderately, had itchy and moist spaces between his toes. Prolonged sitting or walking caused a heavy feeling. This indicated deficiency and sinking of spleen and stomach qi, and he recovered with the use of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, plus Fuling and Banxia.</p>
<p>A scholar, even in the height of summer, enjoyed fueling a fire, often feeling as if his limbs were soaked in boiling soup, with a red face and phlegm resembling real fire. When he vomited, even undigested food came out, and only spicy foods like pepper and ginger provided relief. I believed that the expulsion of food meant that his spleen and stomach were deficient and cold, so I prescribed Ba Wei Wan and Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with roasted ginger; he gradually improved and was stable within a month.</p>
<p>Another scholar was fond of drinking and often experienced slickness and dampness, decreased appetite, and gradual swelling of the legs and feet. This was due to the deficiency and cold of the spleen and kidneys. I used a modified Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan, and as he continued to eat, the swelling subsided. I further employed Ba Wei Wan to strengthen the stomach and invigorate the spleen, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>The attendant Tan Xizeng had a cough with phlegm and cold hands and feet. I thought he suffered from deficiency and cold of the spleen and lungs, prescribing Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with roasted ginger; he recovered completely.</p>
<p>The official Liang Houzai experienced shortness of breath with phlegm, red and scanty urination, and pain in the heels, with a pulse that was floating and large, and felt slippery upon palpation. This indicated kidney deficiency and phlegm accumulation. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction combined with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, feeling well within the month. Teacher Zhongjing stated: when there is qi deficiency with phlegm, use Shen Qi Wan to replenish and expel it. This indeed enlightens later students and benefits countless individuals. Shen Qi Wan is the same as Liu Wei Wan.<a id="trans-431p" href="#orig-431p" class="marker">[431p]</a><br>A scholar suffered from nocturnal emissions, experiencing pain in his heels, dryness of the mouth, thirst, and dry stools. In the afternoon, he felt particularly hot. He was treated with the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; combined with peony and codonopsis, and adjusted with modified &quot;Ba Wei Wan,&quot; which led to his recovery. </p>
<p>Judge Xu Keming, due to improper diet, experienced fever in the afternoon, dry mouth, body fatigue, red and painful urination, and aching legs. Knowing a bit about medicine, he self-treated with the Four Substances Decoction, rhubarb, and anemarrhena, but his condition worsened: dizziness, red eyes, tinnitus, dry lips, alternating chills and heat, phlegm buildup, painful and hot stools, and red painful urination. He then tried the Four Substances Decoction along with other herbs, resulting in chest fullness, loss of appetite, excessive sweating, and a confused mind. I observed that his heavy sweating had depleted his Yang energy, leaving his spirit unanchored. Therefore, I prescribed five qian each of ginseng and astragalus, three qian each of rehmannia and atractylodes, and one qian each of polygala, tuckahoe, sour jujube seed, and honey-fried licorice. After taking this, he fell into a deep sleep for a long time, and his condition gradually improved with the four medications. He subsequently took Eight Treasure Decoction for nourishment and eventually recovered.</p>
<p>Another scholar, due to repeated marriages, suffered from weakness and pain in his legs, a dark complexion, reduced appetite, chills, swollen feet, abdominal distention and pain, and wheezing from phlegm. I believed he had a deficiency of the Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) with coldness from Yang deficiency. I prescribed the Eight Flavor Pill, which provided immediate relief for all symptoms. After taking the pill for six months, his vital energy gradually recovered, and his physical condition returned to normal.<a id="trans-432p" href="#orig-432p" class="marker">[432p]</a><br>A woman experienced fever, dry mouth, and irregular menstruation. After half a year, she felt weakness in her legs. After taking medicine to dispel wind and dampness, her legs became increasingly swollen and painful, and she felt more fatigued, with menstrual issues persisting. I diagnosed her with deficiencies in liver, spleen, and kidney, administering the Six and Eight Flavor Pills. After taking them for two months, her symptoms gradually improved.</p>
<p>A man felt pain in his inner thighs. After using a remedy to drain dampness and resolve phlegm, the pain extended to his buttocks, he had a flushed face and coughed up phlegm, and his heels felt hot. I stated that this was due to kidney deficiency and the excess heat rising. He did not believe me and took medicines like Huangbo and Zhimu, which led to his demise.</p>
<p>A scholar named Zhang Lid brought upon himself issues due to improper diet and lifestyle. His feet were hot, he had a dry mouth, and coughed up phlegm. He tried the Er Chen and Si Wu formulas but his symptoms worsened, with notable weakness in his legs. I asserted this was a sign of kidney deficiency. Disbelieving this, he continued with his previous medications, leading to itching in his heels, which he thought was due to toxic sores. He then took damp-dispersing medicine, leading to redness, swelling, and increased heat; when he used external applications, the sores broke open and leaked fluid, but they did not heal for a long time. Eventually, upon using the Poison-Expelling Pill, he found his sores protruding like peaches and began to believe my words. He nourished his source of transformation and, after half a year, recovered.</p>
<p>The scholar Zhang Lid suffered from pain in his left thigh. After using medications to clear heat and drain dampness, he experienced redness, swelling, and pain radiating to his waist and ribs, along with weakness in his legs and feet. I suspected a deficiency in the three Yin meridians and treated him with nourishing Qi and the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. After more than two months, his vitality gradually restored, symptoms receded, and he was pleased with his careful recovery. After a year, he was fully healed.<a id="trans-433p" href="#orig-433p" class="marker">[433p]</a><br>A patient had sores on both legs, dark in color like iron and resembling itching eczema for three to four months, with recurring itching and pain, oozing pus, internal heat during the afternoon, dry mouth, and a dusky complexion. These are symptoms of kidney deficiency, which were resolved after taking a modified version of the Six Flavor Pill for several days. </p>
<p>Another man experienced spontaneous seminal emissions, heel pain, thirst, and constipation, with severe heat in the afternoon. He was cured by using a tonifying formula combined with peony, andrographis, and the Six Flavor Pill. </p>
<p>A magistrate named Wang Rulin had burning sensations in both feet and was expectorating phlegm like flooding, with his left pulse weak. I diagnosed this as deficiency of the three yin channels. He, however, took four substances, Er Chen decoction, berberine, and Anemarrhena and experienced throat and tongue pain. After taking a clearing heat and dispelling toxin formula, his tongue became like a red peach, and his pulse was rapid but weak. This indicated injury to the spleen and lungs, and severe kidney deficiency, leading to ascending false fire and phlegm accumulation. He needed to nourish the source of transformation to generate kidney water, so he was treated with the Middle-Positive Qi Decoction and the Six Flavor Pill, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another elder named Jin Jiean suffered from itching and oozing between his toes, along with swelling and burning on the feet. Anti-itching medications did not help, and he worsened with dampness-removal medicines. I suspected kidney yin deficiency with damp heat descending. He was treated with the Six Flavor Pill and the Middle-Positive Qi Decoction and recovered.<a id="trans-434p" href="#orig-434p" class="marker">[434p]</a><br>Li Beixi, a major official, suffered from redness and pain in his left foot. This foot was afflicted by damp heat descending from the three yang meridians. First, garlic paste was applied for moxibustion, and after taking a dose of Huoming Decoction, the pain stopped immediately. Water oozed from the moxibustion site, and the redness and swelling subsided. Next, he took four doses of Tuoli Baidu Powder, and pus emerged from the affected area, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Scholar Yang Juyuan had a problem with his foot that was slightly swollen, painful, and mildly red. This condition stemmed from yin deficiency and damp heat descending from the three yin meridians. Moxibustion with garlic paste and the use of Tuoli Powder prompted hair growth. After taking Shiquan Dabu Decoction, pus formed, and he was further treated with the modified Eight Flavor Pill, consuming over a hundred doses until the condition resolved.</p>
<p>Another scholar experienced swelling and hardness in his foot, which had been ongoing for over two months. The condition resulted from deficiency in the three yin meridians being invaded by external cold. He used Da Fangfeng Decoction and Shiquan Dabu Decoction simultaneously to reduce the swelling. Later, after suffering from dietary issues and fatigue due to environmental factors, the initial symptoms reappeared alongside night sweats, internal heat, indigestion, and weight loss. This indicated that his spleen was deficient and cold, unable to generate fire in the life gate. He took over a hundred doses of the Eight Flavor Pill and Yiqi Decoction, benefiting from his youth, and ultimately recovered.</p>
<p>A man reported feeling heat in the soles of his feet and experienced thirst that led him to drink excessively. He was treated with Siwu Decoction, Poria, Lianhua, Huangbai, and Zhimu, along with symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, irritability, and extreme thirst. This situation indicated depletion of the three yin. The previous medications harmed his spleen and stomach; therefore, he first took several doses of Liu Junzi Decoction with roasted ginger to awaken the spleen and stomach, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction enhanced with Poria and Banxia to strengthen them. Eventually, he took the modified Eight Flavor Pill alongside for half a year until he recovered.<a id="trans-435p" href="#orig-435p" class="marker">[435p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar felt a burning and itching sensation in the soles of his feet. He soaked them in hot soup, which caused discharge of water, and his body became weak and trembled, feeling thirsty and coughing up phlegm. This was due to deficiency in the spleen and kidneys leading to phlegm accumulation. After taking vitality tonic and Six Flavor Rehmannia decoction for more than nine years, his vital energy was restored and all symptoms improved.</p>
<p>The young Zongbo observed that Dongjiang appeared thirsty. I said: This is due to deficiency in the kidney channel; nourishment should be provided to the source to prevent future problems. Although he acknowledged this, he ultimately did not take the remedy. In September of the following year, the left foot developed a sore with a dark color and no pain, and the leg felt heavy. After applying garlic for more than thirty treatments, the foot and leg became lighter, the sore bled and released water, and within a few days it subsided, but the sore remained dark. At that time, he planned to travel north to celebrate a long life. I diagnosed him and said: The spleen pulse is weak, and the yang energy is extremely deficient; it is not suitable for long journeys. He replied: I have often dreamed that many immortals await me; this is a sign of longevity. Upon reaching the Hejian post, he was critically ill. He sighed and said: Can sitting in meditation keep me here? Ultimately, he passed away there; it was indeed a different fate.</p>
<p>A person had a finger on his foot affected by gangrene, with burning pain, redness, and heat. After applying garlic, he took the detoxifying powder from ginseng, adding platycodon, honeysuckle, angelica dahurica, and rhubarb in two doses to stop the pain. Then, he took the Ten Xuan Powder without platycodon and guanggui, adding tianhuafen and honeysuckle in several doses until he recovered.<a id="trans-436p" href="#orig-436p" class="marker">[436p]</a><br>A man over forty years old had a red, swollen, and painful large toe on his left foot. This was due to accumulated toxins in the spleen channel, termed &quot;jie ju&quot; (a type of ulcer). The symptoms included redness and swelling. The treatment involved the use of a formula that included Ren Shen (ginseng) and Bai Zhi (angelica dahurica), with an addition of Jin Yin Hua (honeysuckle) and Da Huang (rhubarb). After administering four doses, another formula with Jin Yin Hua, Gan Cao (licorice), and other herbs helped alleviate the condition; subsequently, a remedy was given that included Gui (cassia) and additional herbs. The patient recovered.</p>
<p>Another individual had a toe with &quot;jie ju&quot; that showed purple-red discoloration but was not painful. After receiving over fifty moxibustion treatments with garlic, there was still no pain. Eventually, a hundred moxibustion applications initiated pain, and four doses of &quot;Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin&quot; (a famous remedy) were administered, leading to a discharge and subsequent recovery.</p>
<p>A man over fifty years old with a diet rich in fat also suffered from &quot;jie ju,&quot; displaying a purple-black color and swelling in his foot. Master Sun stated: &quot;For this condition, immediate amputation is necessary, as toxins may spread to the abdomen and become untreatable. If the color is black and there is no pain, it is also untreatable.&quot; The patient, however, maintained his usual appetite and showed signs of being in good health, which indicated a treatable ulcer. Therefore, six doses of Lian Qiao Bai Du San (a detoxifying formula) were given, supplemented with over twenty doses of Jin Yin Hua and Gan Cao. The affected toe eventually burst and discharged. Further treatment included a combination of herbs such as Xiong, Gui, Sheng Di, Lian Qiao, Jin Yin Hua, and Bai Zhi, which led to recovery. The following year, he suddenly experienced thirst, and I treated him with &quot;Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan&quot; (an eight-flavor pill), but he did not comply. He took Sheng Jin and other medicines, which worsened his condition, and eventually stopped after taking the eight-flavor pill.<a id="trans-437p" href="#orig-437p" class="marker">[437p]</a><br>A patient had a sore on the left toe, which was numb and red. The next day, the toe turned black, and in five days, the entire foot became black and cold, with no sensation of pain and a deep, thin pulse. This was due to the spleen and stomach being poisoned, so I administered a dose of the Flying Dragon Death-Seizing Pill. The next day, I instructed to cut away the dead black flesh on the foot; after the cut, the bone began to ache, which could be treated using the Complete Vitality Soup, leading to recovery. The dead flesh was the result of heavy toxic Qi obstructing the nourishing Qi. Moreover, when it reaches the depths of Yin, blood and Qi have difficulty circulating. The classics say that the induced wind leads to late-stage illnesses. If one were to attack aggressively, the evil Qi would exploit the vulnerability, making recovery impossible.</p>
<p>Another patient had a sore on the toe with black coloration and no pain. I instructed him to apply moxibustion intensely for over thirty sessions, resulting in pain, while he retained a good appetite. I advised urgent amputation and the prompt intake of tonics, but he did not believe me and delayed, ultimately leading to irreparable damage.</p>
<p>A different patient had a sore on the toe that appeared red, painful, and caused intense thirst. After administering moxibustion with garlic several times, he took three doses of the Immortal Life-Saving Decoction, which led to the sore breaking open. He continued with supplements to promote healing, including the Modified Eight Flavor Pill, ultimately leading to recovery.<a id="trans-438p" href="#orig-438p" class="marker">[438p]</a><br>A woman over forty years old recently developed a toxin due to a ringworm infection. Her pulse was deep and tight, and she could not extend her legs. The classics state: &quot;Spleen cold shifts to the liver, causing abscess and muscle spasms.&quot; The spleen governs flesh, while the liver governs tendons; when flesh is warm, tendons relax, and when flesh is cold, tendons become tense. Therefore, I prescribed Ruxiang Dingtong Pills, which provided slight relief. I then administered over twenty doses of medicines to aid the stomach and boost qi and blood, leading to a cure.</p>
<p>Wang Ruda experienced redness and swelling in his knees and legs, with pain in his bones. After taking Shixuan Powder, he showed no improvement. Upon examining his pulse, which was deep and thin, I prescribed two doses of Wujia Powder, which stopped the pain. Then, I gave him Shixuan Powder with the addition of Jiujing (Achyranthes) and Duzhong (Eucommia) for over thirty doses, resulting in purulence and recovery. This swelling was due to cold qi and the changes caused by the eight winds.</p>
<p>A man suffered from gangrene on his toe, with severe pain and redness. I instructed to apply moxibustion with garlic until the pain subsided. I prescribed Ren Shen Bai Du San, adding Jie Geng (Platycodon) and Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle), along with Bai Zhi (Angelica), and Da Huang (Rhubarb) for it to erupt, followed by Xianfang Huo Ming Yin for a cure. Although this condition was small in outward appearance, it had severe consequences, necessitating moxibustion with garlic. For those who did not feel pain, direct moxibustion was recommended to reduce the toxicity.</p>
<p>A man experienced gangrene on the back of his foot, exhibiting redness, swelling, and pain. I advised applying moxibustion with garlic over thirty times until the pain ceased, followed by four doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Yin, resulting in eruption, and thereafter used medicines to purge toxins for recovery.</p>
<p>Another man had gangrene on his toe, which was red, painful, and made him thirsty. After several applications of moxibustion with garlic, he took three doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Yin, leading to an eruption. He then took the detoxification medicine along with a modified Bawei Wan for recovery.<a id="trans-439p" href="#orig-439p" class="marker">[439p]</a><br>A man suffered from gangrene on the dorsum of his foot; it was dark in color but neither swollen nor painful. He was restless and extremely thirsty, with a large and weak pulse. This indicated that his vital energy had already been exhausted and that treatment would be futile. Eventually, he passed away.</p>
<p>A woman injured her index finger while doing her nails, which became pus-filled but would not burst. She experienced extreme pain up to her hand, applying cold medicine, which led to swelling extending to her wrist, along with mild nausea and reduced appetite. She believed it to be an internal attack of toxic energy. Upon examining her pulse, which was deep and thin, I determined that this pain stemmed from damage to her stomach&#39;s energy, and proceeded with acupuncture. I prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additions of patchouli and angelica, after which her appetite improved; later, I gave her the Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus, white atractylodes, and platycodon. She recovered in over a month.</p>
<p>A young girl suffered frostbite on both feet, leading to ulcers in spring, resulting in the loss of her toes. She took fortifying medicine and recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had an ingrown toenail on her finger for over a year without healing; she drained several drops of pus daily. I indicated that the big toe is the source of the liver and spleen meridians and recommended moxibustion at the affected area to eliminate the stagnant flesh, allowing the yang energy to reach it, so that the wound would heal naturally; otherwise, it would not heal. She neglected this advice and did not seek early treatment, later developing a debilitating condition and ultimately passed away. This condition, often encountered in women, frequently arises from tight bindings that obstruct the blood vessels or from being assaulted by wind pathogens, resulting in a lack of blood and energy nourishment, ultimately leading to necrotic tissue. The appropriate treatment required strengthening the spleen and stomach, promoting circulation of energy, and generating blood to achieve recovery. </p>
<p>For those with tetanus leading to a tight jaw and facial asymmetry, it is advisable to first administer the Yuzhen Powder for one or two doses, and then use agents that generate blood and promote circulation for better outcomes.<a id="trans-440p" href="#orig-440p" class="marker">[440p]</a><br>A man had an injury on his toe, which was black, not painful, and about to fall off. I said: This is because the yang energy is weak and cannot reach the affected area. It must be removed urgently, and one should hastily take tonics to strengthen the original energy; otherwise, dead flesh will extend to the foot, and it cannot be saved. If one does not believe, the blackened area will indeed rot up the leg and lead to death. Generally, on the hands and feet, where vital energy and blood rarely reach, sores or injuries may arise. If the original energy is harmed, the邪气 (evil energy) will increase, leading to ulcers that extend upwards and cause death. Even if they do not rupture and are discolored, they will still lead to death. If there are broken bones but the sinews and skin are still connected, they must be urgently cut away.</p>
<p>Zhao Zigong&#39;s mother, Mrs. Liu, was sixty years old, with a sore on the front of her left foot, leading down to the big toe and up to the outer ankle, affecting the heel bone. This condition recurred every year, lasting for several months, with severe itching in the evening to the point that she would scratch until it bled like a fountain, moaning in pain, almost unbearable. It would gradually ease at midnight, only to return the next day. Each application of medicine caused the sore to grow larger and more severe, and a hundred attempts at treatment were ineffective, carrying on like this for over twenty years. In the late winter of the year Jiachen during the Chunxi era, the master was a senior official. One evening, her illness flared up intensely, and in despair, they wept together with no way out. Overcome with fatigue, he fell asleep and dreamed of four divine monks silently sitting in a room, with a long couch beside them, where Zigong also sat and sighed. One monk asked him about the matter, and Zigong replied truthfully. The monk said: You can take &quot;Cow Gold and Tiger Pill.&quot;<a id="trans-441p" href="#orig-441p" class="marker">[441p]</a><br>Another monk said: &quot;Cinnabar can also be taken.&quot; Upon awakening, I was quite surprised. I tried to take half a grain of the medicine, but forced myself to consume it. After a long while, I experienced severe pain, and my family wept and regretted the action. Soon, I passed several pounds of stones that felt like iron or rock. That evening, the sores merely itched, caused no pain, and bled not at all; within a few days they formed scabs, and from then on, I completely recovered. The claims about cinnabar were not pursued further. The teacher then depicted the monk&#39;s likeness as in the dream and recorded the events. The Golden Tiger Pill, derived from the &quot;Harmony Medicine Bureau Formulas,&quot; is primarily for treating phlegm obstructing strokes and includes ingredients like cow bile, dragon brain, and fine powders, which are unsuitable for the elderly. Now, it has unexpectedly yielded remarkable effects, suggesting that heat accumulated in the organs manifests on the skin. If this has deep roots after many years, it is not easy to cleanse, so a cooling agent is employed to tackle it, which should not be judged in the usual way. The monk’s dream was indeed a matter of filial piety.<a id="trans-442p" href="#orig-442p" class="marker">[442p]</a><br>The chief official Chen Rulin suffered from weak and aching legs, with his heels swollen, sometimes painful and sometimes itchy, appearing bare or cracked, feeling swollen, painful, and hot day and night. He used the Revitalizing Qi Decoction with ingredients from the Eight Flavors Pill, nourishing the liver and kidneys, and eventually recovered.</p>
<p>A man experienced heel pain, felt feverish and fatigued, with urination resembling dribbling. He mistakenly took a dispersing toxin powder, which led to headaches, chills, loss of appetite, and coughs with phlegm. This was due to deficiencies in the Three Yin of the foot, and the medicine further caused harm. I administered over fifty doses of the Complete Tonifying Decoction and modified Eight Flavors Pill, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>Another man, careless with his lifestyle, developed internal heat leading to thirst and fatigue, with his feet feeling hot and pain in the heel. He took remedies for clearing heat and removing dampness, which increased swelling. He also used toxin-dispelling medicine, resulting in severe redness and pain. The condition resembled a ruptured red pomegranate, with heat and pain like that of a needle, internal heat worsening in the evening. This was due to deficiencies in the Three Yin of the foot. I used the Complete Tonifying Decoction in the morning and modified Eight Flavors Pill in the evening, with external application of Angelica ointment, and after more than two months, he recovered. Those who relied on disinfecting medications alone and perished cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Another man also suffered from heel ulcers, took disinfecting powder, and applied corrosive medicine, resulting in symptoms of deficiency and causing his condition to deteriorate. He appeared skeletal and seemed certain to die. I used the Complete Tonifying Decoction with added cornelian cherry and yam, and after more than two months, he recovered.<a id="trans-443p" href="#orig-443p" class="marker">[443p]</a><br>Zhu Zuo Xiang, due to a slip, suddenly made a sound; after sitting or standing for a long time, his left foot became numb, and although it was summer, his feet felt as cold as ice. In the summer of the Jiajing year of the Ji-hai, he got drunk and fell asleep, then drank water and fell asleep again, subsequently feeling a hard lump in his right abdomen. When he touched it, there was a gurgling sound inside his belly; rubbing it warmed up the area but released gas and then stopped the noise. The discomfort often intensified, and even slightly overeating would cause pain and diarrhea. He sought treatment from doctors, who prescribed him a pill made from bitter orange and herbs, but it was ineffective. In the year of the Jiachen, he sought treatment from me. I said: This is not a condition of the spleen and stomach, but rather a decline of the life gate fire that is unable to generate earth, leading to a false cold reaction. If one focuses only on the spleen and stomach, that would be a misjudgment. He could take the Eight Flavor Pill, which would cure him. He respectfully took it, and indeed it worked. The Eight Flavor Pill contains aconite, which doctors typically dare not use lightly. Aconite is akin to cutting through barriers and restoring life; only a virtuous general can utilize it properly.</p>
<p>Yang Jin Yi had a boil on his heel, about the size of a bean, which was very painful and resembled a condition caused by a cold. I commented that hunters can get their heels bitten by rabbits, resulting in sores that turn into lifelong ailments. If a person&#39;s heel suffers from sores, they too will never fully heal, hence it is named “rabbit bite.” I then treated him with a restorative elixir and internal blocking powder, which provided slight relief. Subsequently, due to indulging in pleasures, he experienced pain and took strong poison-clearing medications, which weakened his blood and energy, leading to limpness in his legs and knees, eventually culminating in death. The heel is the source of the two primary tendons and the passageway of the kidney meridian; if the sore does not heal properly, the energy cannot rise, and the kidney energy thus leaks out, leading to a lifelong ailment. Moreover, the sore had originally developed from deficiency, and he did not heed warnings. Even a robust tonification of qi and blood would still be insufficient, let alone the harmful and aggressive toxic medicines that could further harm him.<a id="trans-444p" href="#orig-444p" class="marker">[444p]</a><br>A wealthy person, feeling heat in their legs and thirst, had a rapid but weak pulse on the left side. I believed this indicated a deficiency in the three yin of the legs, warning against the onset of sores. Not trusting, they took more cooling and phlegm-resolving medications, which only increased the evening heat and headaches; later, they took Si Wu decoction, Huangbai, and Zhimu. The evening heat intensified, their appetite diminished, and sores appeared on their small feet and face. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan over a hundred doses, and they recovered. Many do not believe that sores can arise from such issues and thus do not seek help.</p>
<p>A woman experienced irregular menstruation, evening fevers, and discomfort in her chest, with reduced appetite and a lack of interest in food. She took medications to clear heat and move the bowels, but her symptoms worsened, with added body aches; after two or three months, her menstruation returned, but she continued to have symptoms. Medication to promote circulation and reduce fire caused pain in her heels and toes, with heat like burning. I determined it was a deficiency in the three yin of the legs and prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan; over two months, her symptoms gradually improved. I also used previous formulas along with Ba Zhen Decoction, and after two months, she recovered.<a id="trans-445p" href="#orig-445p" class="marker">[445p]</a><br>A woman suffered from swelling in her heel, her legs feeling weak and sore, sometimes red, sometimes white, with pain or itching. It felt as if there was no skin, or like cracks appeared. From day to night, there was swelling, pain, and heat. This was due to deficiency of the three Yin of the foot. I prescribed modified Eight Flavor Pill and Xiao Yao San, adding cooked Rehmannia and Chuanxiong, and after over a hundred doses, she was cured.</p>
<p>Another woman experienced heat and pain in her heel due to exertion. I believed it was due to deficiency of the three Yin of the foot, and after treating her with Eight Treasure Decoction, she recovered. Later, she developed itching all over her body. After taking wind-dispelling medicine, she had fever and convulsions, with a strong and rapid pulse indicating blood deficiency in the liver and excess fire generating wind. I prescribed pills made from Tianzhu and Danxing, along with Four-Substance Decoction, Mai Men Dong, Wu Wei Zi, and a combination of Qin Jiao, Lian Qiao, roasted licorice, Mountain Gardenia, and Chai Hu, and treated her with decoctions, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>A woman experienced heat and pain in both feet, especially in the heels, which worsened in the afternoon. I diagnosed it as deficiency of liver and kidney blood. I used modified Xiao Yao San and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan with more than fifty doses, and all symptoms were resolved.</p>
<p>Yang Taipu of Xindu, over forty years old, had redness and swelling with heat and pain in the big toe of his left foot. This was a result of toxic accumulation from the spleen meridian descending, known as &quot;violent ulcer.&quot; With red color and pain, I used Shen Ling Bai Zhu San but removed ginseng and Platycodon, adding honeysuckle, Angelica Dahurica, and a dose of rhubarb. After further prescriptions of (Sichuan) Folium, honeysuckle, and licorice, he improved significantly, followed by using Shi Xuan San while removing Platycodon and cinnamon and adding honeysuckle and Fang Ji in several doses, after which he recovered.<a id="trans-446p" href="#orig-446p" class="marker">[446p]</a><br>Han the judge also suffered from a type of ulcer, which was purple and red but not painful. After using garlic compresses for over fifty applications, he still did not feel pain, and only after a hundred applications did he begin to feel it. He was then treated with a detoxifying powder combined with honeysuckle and bai zhi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had pain in her arm with muscle spasms, unable to extend or bend it; the pain worsened with cold, and her pulse was tight and thin. This was identified as a deficiency of liver qi, with wind and cold circulating through the blood vessels and obstructing the muscles. When the muscles are not nourished, they become stiff and painful. She was first treated with a muscle relaxing decoction, and then with a version of the four-substance decoction adding peony root, moonwort, and bai zhu, which healed her. There were also cases of arm pain where she could not lift it or experienced pain when turning, likely caused by phlegm stagnating at the center of the body, with spleen qi not flowing properly; for these, the formula fu ling wan or kong yan dan was suitable.</p>
<p>A county magistrate Hu experienced pain all over his body, and two months later, swelling developed on the top of his left foot; shortly thereafter, his thigh also had a swollen area. The pulse was light and diagnostic indicated a floating nature, while deeper examination showed a slow pulse. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood, with the pores not being tight, allowing cold evil to invade the deficiency. He was treated with a modified small life-preserving decoction for four doses and several doses of a decoction of du huo and gui zhi, which alleviated his pain. He continued treatment with a tonic containing shen, qi, gui, and zhu for a hundred applications until he recovered.</p>
<p>Liu Sheng had a lump in his arm resembling a chestnut, extending to his neck and resembling scrofula. This was attributed to an invasion of wind and dampness, and he was treated similarly to the previous cases, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-447p" href="#orig-447p" class="marker">[447p]</a><br>A woman had a dark purple patch about an inch wide on her inner thighs that oozed when scratched. She used remedies to dispel wind and invigorate blood, and over the course of a year, it gradually opened up to the size of a palm. She then took herbal medicines like Cao Wu, which led to itching all over her body, intermittent blood oozing, internal heat, and fatigue; her appetite diminished, and her menstrual cycle occurred every three months with a strong and rapid pulse. Upon examination, her pulse was weak, indicating that the drying agents further harmed her spleen and blood. I first prescribed a modified Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Shao Yao, Chuan Xiong, and other herbs for over ten doses, then administered a modified Xiao Yao San with Shu Di and Diao Teng for over twenty doses, and finally used Gui Pi Decoction with Chuan Xiong and Shu Di Huang, but it did not improve.</p>
<p>A man prone to anger had a greenish face and suffered from eczema-like symptoms on his inner thighs, with redness and itching. He sought treatment through bloodletting, which resulted in heat, swelling, and pain. Taking Xiao Feng San aggravated his condition, and consuming Yu Xian Dan intensified his thirst and fever. Despite this, he continued the treatment, resulting in profuse pus and water, with a rapid pulse, particularly on the left side. I opined that the liver meridian was deficient in blood, causing internal heat to harm the blood and exacerbate the sores. I initially used several doses of Chai Hu Qing Gan San and then treated him with Si Wu and Shan Zhi Zi, leading to gradual recovery. After two months of taking Ba Zhen Tang and Di Huang Wan, he was cured.</p>
<p>One person had a carbuncle on the inner side of the leg; it was swollen and painful but had not formed pus. After taking Huang Qi Chai Hu Tang for two doses, he improved slightly, and after two more doses, the swelling subsided.</p>
<p>Another individual had a leg carbuncle that was swollen and painful, with cold limbs, a sensation of throat obstruction, and chills and fever. He did not respond to various treatments, which indicated that the evil was obstructing the meridians. I prescribed a dose of Wu Xiang Lian Qiao Tang, leading to slight improvement in symptoms; upon further administration, he had two bowel movements, after which all symptoms subsided and he recovered.<a id="trans-448p" href="#orig-448p" class="marker">[448p]</a><br>Ding Lan, over twenty years old, had a long-standing internal suffering due to a toxin in his thigh. He sought to expel it internally. Upon examining the pulse, which was slippery and rapid, I knew the pus had formed, but due to the deficiency of qi and blood, it had not burst. I therefore made an incision, allowing the pus to flow out with pain accompanying it. I applied Ba Zhen Tang, which had slight effect, but the pus was still light and thin. I then used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with five fen of charred Fu Zi; after taking several doses, he gradually improved. He continued on Shi Quan Da Bu Tang for over twenty more doses and was healed. Dan Xi said: &quot;If pus discharges yet pain persists, it indicates deficiency.&quot; He Jian also stated similarly.</p>
<p>There was a monk with a lump on the outer thigh, neither painful nor suppurating. I treated it with over twenty doses of expelling toxins medicine, which led to pus formation; I then incised it, resulting in pain. I stated that if it swelled and then ruptured, with pain following, this indicates severe qi and blood deficiency. It needs vigorous tonification. However, they said: &quot;Pain cannot be treated with tonics.&quot; I argued that when the upright qi is insufficient, it must be replenished; tonifying it will allow the qi to transform, thus alleviating pain. I then treated it with Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Dang Gui, Bai Zhu, and Shu Di Huang. After over two months, he recovered. Generally, sores and ulcers initially present as swelling. The accumulation of qi and blood causes the flesh to fester into pus, which often results in pain. After the pus discharges, the swelling subsides, the flesh relaxes, and the pain must gradually lessen. If the pain intensifies, this indicates insufficient qi and blood, affirming the perspectives of Dan Xi and He Jian on severe deficiency.</p>
<p>One person had a festering sore on the outer side of the thigh, which was greatly swollen and painful. I prescribed Nei Tuo Huang Qi Tang decocted with wine for two doses, which provided slight relief. I then applied Tuo Li San for several doses, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another individual, over twenty years old and weak by constitution, suffered from a toxin on the outer side of his left leg for three months before it ruptured. The pus was light and thin, and the muscles were not regenerating. I administered Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Niu Xi for over twenty doses, leading to gradual improvement. He further underwent moxibustion with Dou Chi for over a month and was healed.<a id="trans-449p" href="#orig-449p" class="marker">[449p]</a><br>A man had a history of athlete&#39;s foot, experiencing pain under his ribs, fever, dizziness, vomiting, and numbness in his legs. He took medications like Disinfectant Heart Protector but did not improve. His left pulse was tight, and his right pulse was wiry, which also indicated athlete&#39;s foot. He was treated with Banxia Houpo Decoction and recovered.</p>
<p>A person had a leg sore that was ulcerated; after needling it, pus came out amounting to about four or five bowls. He experienced severe chills and a lack of appetite, with a pulse that felt like silk, indicating that yang energy was weak. He was given a modified Si Jun Zi Tang with a dose of fried Aconite, which slightly alleviated his chills. After four doses, he no longer felt chills. Then he received Liu Jun Zi Tang with a few doses of cinnamon, and his appetite greatly improved. Eventually, he was given the Total Strengthening Decoction combined with moxibustion on Aconite cakes, and he fully recovered in two months.</p>
<p>An elderly man had a leg sore that spontaneously ruptured; he suddenly became dizzy, with a weak and thin pulse, indicating a severe deficiency of qi and blood. He was treated with a strengthening tonic and regained consciousness.</p>
<p>A person had a leg sore accompanied by muscle spasms and pain, with a wiry and tight pulse. He was treated with Wujisan plus Huangbo, Chaihu, and Cangzhu, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had pain in her left leg that prevented her from extending it; her pulse was wiry and tight, and pressing on it produced a cool sensation. She was treated with two doses of Wujisan, which reduced the pain somewhat, followed by another two doses until it completely ceased. She recovered through the method of nourishing the spirit to support the true essence. The wiry and tight pulse indicated coldness, hence, Wujisan, which is warm and spicy, was used to disperse it.</p>
<p>A person had redness, swelling, and pain in the right leg; upon pulse examination, it was found to be deep and rapid. He was given a decoction based on Angelica to address the pain. While his limbs also ached, indicating dampness and toxicity had become obstructive, the potency of the medication was hard to reach the lower body. Therefore, a different concoction was not suitable. Consequently, he received acupuncture at the affected area to expel toxins and blood, and continued with the previous medication. After one dose, he felt significant relief, and after four doses, the condition resolved completely.<a id="trans-450p" href="#orig-450p" class="marker">[450p]</a><br>One man, over fifty years old, suffered from an abscess in his leg during winter. His pulse was rapid and agitated, he experienced constipation after drinking cold, and the swelling and pain were quite severe. This indicated heat lingering within, so it was advisable to use bitter and cold medicine, doubling the dose of Huangqin in a cool drink. The heat quickly receded, and he was cured with Siwu Decoction plus Huangqin.</p>
<p>Another man, aged thirty, had ongoing worries and was prone to overexertion and indulging in lust. The outside of his left leg was red and swollen like millet. A doctor prescribed Dafu Shiqi and Chengqi for purging, while another doctor prescribed Dahuang, Zhushā, and Xuejie, which led to a large and weak pulse, and he ultimately died. This was due to the pattern of more qi and less blood associated with Jueyin.</p>
<p>A man with a leg abscess developed pus, which was needled, resulting in about two bowls of pus being discharged. After taking a dose of Tori medicine, he ran a high fever. Further doses of Shengyu Decoction were given and the fever subsided. The next day, he felt severe chills and had no appetite, with a pulse as fine as a thread. One liang of ginseng and three slices of Shudufu were decocted and taken, leading to recovery. However, he still had poor appetite and insomnia, so he was treated with Neibu Huangqi Decoction until he stabilized.</p>
<p>A man with swollen legs and feverish chills was treated with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. He thought this treatment was slow and instead took drugs like Qin and Lian, which intensified the heat, prompting him to seek further treatment. I gave him over twenty doses of Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction, leading to a resolution of the problem. Subsequently, I prescribed ginseng, Huangqi, Angelica, Atractylodes, roasted licorice, and cinnamon for about a month until the issue was contained. </p>
<p>When dealing with fire-type illnesses, one should differentiate between deficiency and excess. Qin and Lian, being bitter and cold, can drain excessive fire from the heart and lungs. However, when dealing with the elderly or those weakened by diet and overwork, the condition is one of insufficiency, which requires sweet warming remedies for treatment. It is never seen that there is excess heat accompanied by a fear of cold or deficiency heat accompanied by a liking for cold; this is the principle observed.<a id="trans-451p" href="#orig-451p" class="marker">[451p]</a><br>Chen Jiansheng was in his thirties, with his left leg slightly swollen and experiencing hidden pain. Although the color of the flesh remained the same over time, he had little appetite. Dongyuan stated: &quot;In cases of sores and swellings, when there is hardness below the swelling, it arises from the tendons and bones.&quot; This was a bone-abscess, due to genuine qi deficiency and dampness invading the flesh. It is said that all swellings relate to the stomach; if food intake is low, the stomach becomes weak. The treatment should aim to strengthen the stomach&#39;s qi. Thus, a modified Liujunzi Decoction was prescribed with added Huo Xiang and Dang Gui over several doses, gradually increasing his diet, followed by a recovery with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction.</p>
<p>One individual experienced pain all over his body, and after two months, a lump formed on the top of his foot. Shortly after, another painful area appeared on his thigh. Light pulse diagnosis showed a floating nature, and a more thorough examination indicated it was floating and slow. This was due to insufficient qi and blood, with the pores being loose, allowing cold pathogens to invade the deficiency. Four doses of a modified Xiao Xu Ming Decoction and several doses of Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction were administered, leading to a sudden relief of pain; further treatment with a tonic containing increased quantities of Ren Shen, Qi, Gui, and Shu yielded full recovery.</p>
<p>Wang Jingshan from the southern garrison had swelling and pain in his legs, with alternating chills and fever, yet maintained a normal appetite. His pulse was forceful and rapid, indicating damp-heat stagnation in the foot’s three yang channels. A single dose of Ping Su Bai Du San alleviated the chills and fever, and another dose relieved the swelling and pain; further use of Xiao Yao San restored his original qi. Two months later, due to anger, he experienced pain from swelling akin to being driven by needles, with a diffuse reddish hue. Two doses of Huoming Decoction alleviated the pain, and further treatment with Ba Zhen Tang, augmented with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Dan Pi, completely stopped the pain. Subsequently, due to labor, he became fatigued and apathetic about food, feeling heavy in the legs. This was attributed to the spleen and stomach qi deficiency, which failed to elevate; a prescription of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Man Jing Zi was used for stabilization.<a id="trans-452p" href="#orig-452p" class="marker">[452p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar suffered from swelling and pain in his legs, with unchanged flesh color, chills and fever, poor appetite, and fatigue. This indicated insufficient spleen energy, with damp phlegm descending. He was treated with modified Baizhu Yiqi Decoction, adding Banxia, Shaoyao, and Fuling, which alleviated the chills and fever, and reduced the swelling and pain. After over ten doses, his spleen and stomach were strengthened, and his body regained health.</p>
<p>A man entered a room and experienced swelling and hardness in both legs, with constipation. I suggested that the kidneys open to the two lower orifices, indicating damage to the liver and kidneys. I prescribed Liuwei Dihuang Wan, adding Cheqianzi and Niuxi for two convenient bowel movements, and used the Baizhu Yiqi Decoction to reduce the swelling and hardness, pleased that he was young and survived.</p>
<p>A scholar suffered severe pain in his leg, like being pierced, with unchanged flesh color, a sallow complexion, poor appetite, and intense pain leading to vomiting. This pain was harmful to the stomach. I treated him with Liu Junzi Decoction to strengthen his spleen and stomach, and used Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction to assist with the pus for acupuncture. Additionally, I increased Ren Shen, Huangqi, Xiong, Danggui, Maidong, Wuweizi, Yuanzhi, and Beimu in the previous decoction for wound healing.<a id="trans-453p" href="#orig-453p" class="marker">[453p]</a><br>A man, burdened and with poor diet, experienced chest pain, mistakenly attributing it to sores and toxins. He took large doses of Da Huang and other medicines, but his right leg swelled without discoloration. He also suffered from headaches, chills, cough, thirst, fever, and a pulse that was large but weak. This was due to a depletion of vital energy from overexertion, exacerbated by the medications harming his stomach energy. I prescribed four doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and several doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, pleased that his youth aided in his recovery.</p>
<p>Honglu Zhai Shaoxi developed sores that eventually led to fever throughout his body, with symptoms including phlegm production, dry mouth, dry throat, night sweats, irritability, red urine, and hot feet, worsening by evening and causing weight loss. This indicated a deficiency of kidney yin with excess fire. I used Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and within a month, all symptoms resolved. After three months, his vital energy was restored.</p>
<p>Another man had swelling in his left leg with normal flesh color, experiencing chills, fever, nausea, and reduced appetite. This indicated insufficient spleen energy affected by external pathogens. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Decoction with addition of Huoxiang, Jiegeng, and Chuanxiong, which alleviated the chills and fever, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to relieve the swelling and pain.</p>
<p>Chen Hu Lu Maocheng, due to excessive drinking and indulging in sexual activities, developed a fever and leg pain resembling sores. I gave him a formula to promote sweating, but both legs became swollen and dark, with a mist-like heat, on the verge of convulsions, and his pulse was notably strong and rapid, especially in the lower extremities. I suggested this was due to deficiency in the three yin channels of the legs, compounded by dampness from alcohol, leading to a loss of vital energy and exacerbation of pathogens. I prescribed Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction with added Shan Yao, Shan Zhu Yu, and Fu Zi, which promptly improved his pulse and symptoms. I then removed Fu Zi and after two more doses he was fully cured.<a id="trans-454p" href="#orig-454p" class="marker">[454p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Medical Cases from Ancient and Modern Texts: Volume 199</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four Limbs Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Cases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Case</strong>: The venerable Xue Xunzhai, aged sixty-one, suffered from wind sores on both legs, with pus oozing and a fever accompanied by phlegm for four years; this was due to kidney wind. He was treated with Liuwei Wan (Six-Flavor Pill) and Sisheng San (Four Fresh Powder) and recovered. After a year, the ailment recurred, spreading throughout his body, worsening in the afternoons, accompanied by phlegm thirst and night sweats, with sores on his lips and tongue and red, dim eyes—indicative of a deficiency of kidney yin and excess fire. He was treated with a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill and was cured. Three years later, he experienced dripping during urination, and painful sensations in the genitals—this indicated impotence with drained essence. The essence failed to emit, leading to internal decay. He was treated with the previous pill and with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Restore the Middle and Augment the Qi) plus wheat husk and five-flavored herb, leading to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Governor Zhang Tianze&#39;s Case</strong>: He had swelling and pain in the left knee, fullness and discomfort in the chest, poor appetite and frequent nausea, with phlegm blocking his head, and increasing fatigue in the afternoons—this indicated a deficiency in the spleen and lungs. He was treated with a scallion poultice and Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction) augmented with fried ginger, which quickly alleviated the symptoms, although appetite remained low. He was given Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Chinese privet fruit, resulting in a clear and refreshed head. Subsequently, he was given over ten doses of Da Fang Feng Tang (Major Siler Decoction) and more than thirty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi, after which the swelling subsided.<a id="trans-455p" href="#orig-455p" class="marker">[455p]</a><br>Liu Guowei from the Dongfu suffered from muscle and bone pain, with his right knee swollen. After using phlegm-resolving and detoxifying medicinals, the swelling and pain worsened, coupled with reduced appetite and fatigue. Adding medicines to dispel wind and detoxify led to chills, fever, and nausea, along with loose stools. After administering Erchen Decoction to dispel dampness, the swelling became red and internal pain felt like being pierced. Upon examining his pulse, it was slippery, rapid, and weak; this indicated the presence of pus, and the vital energy was deficient, unable to resolve. I prescribed four doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, along with one dose of Da Fang Feng Decoction, leading to resolution, and after over a hundred doses, he was cured.</p>
<p>One Confucian scholar experienced leg muscle tension with swollen and painful knees for more than a month, which was caused by deficiency of yin and damp-heat. I used Liu Wei Di Huang Wan as the main treatment, supplemented with Ba Zhen Decoction, adding Niu Xi and Du Zhong, alternating with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and after more than three months, it resolved.</p>
<p>One man had leg pain and knee swelling; the pulse was floating, and palpating revealed a tightness, indicating liver and kidney deficiency, caused by &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; I prescribed two doses of Da Fang Feng Decoction, which resolved the condition. He was confused about the toxicity of Fuzi and thus took medicine meant for ulcers, gradually wasting away and presenting with deficiency symptoms, leading him to seek treatment again. I remarked: fatigue and weight loss indicated that the spleen and stomach were weak and unable to nourish; inability to control urination indicated a deficiency of the bladder; dry heat and empty distension suggested weak stomach qi could not digest; confusion and forgetfulness meant spiritual loss and incoherence. Severe symptoms gathered, and I declined further treatment, after which he ultimately passed away. This condition often afflicts those with deficiency, thus I recommended modified Xiaoxu Ming and Da Fang Feng Decoctions. Using detoxifying medicines would surely be detrimental.<a id="trans-456p" href="#orig-456p" class="marker">[456p]</a><br>A woman experienced swollen and painful knees, which worsened with cold. For over a month, various medicines had no effect, and her pulse was taut and tight, indicating that cold evil was deeply lodged within. I prescribed a large dosage of Fangfeng Decoction combined with Huolong Ointment to alleviate her condition.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen left knee that had not ruptured for three months. I believed that in those with weak constitutions, wind evil attacks the joints, causing qi stagnation, resulting in an enlarged knee and a thinner leg, a condition known as &quot;Crane Knee Wind.&quot; I then administered more than thirty doses of Fangfeng Decoction, and the swelling subsided.</p>
<p>Zhang Shangshe suffered from Crane Knee Wind, with pus flowing for three months after lying on a pillow for half a year. He said that he initially took Fangfeng Decoction without Aconite; as the swelling was about to rupture, he took the Ten Xuan Powder. Now he used the Complete Tonifying Decoction without cinnamon and also received no response. Upon examining his pulse, which was very weak, I prescribed the Complete Tonifying Decoction, increasing the Aconite to ten grams. After more than thirty doses, there was slight improvement; I then reduced the Aconite to five grams and continued for over thirty doses, leading to further recovery; eventually, I removed the Aconite altogether and after another thirty doses, he was cured. </p>
<p>The principle of a formula must suit individual cases. In those with weak qi, if evil enters the bones and joints, obstructing the pathways, one cannot rely on the pungent and warm properties of Aconite and cinnamon to dispel the cold evil from the joints and facilitate the flow of qi and blood through the pathways; it will not lead to healing. Moreover, the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states that Aconite is a holy medicine for treating cold and dampness. Cinnamon opens the blood vessels, eliminates stagnant blood, strengthens the joints, treats wind and dampness, and promotes the efficacy of various medicines.<a id="trans-457p" href="#orig-457p" class="marker">[457p]</a><br>The Ten Complete and Great Tonic Soup is used to treat the aforementioned conditions, and not only should cinnamon not be removed, but aconite should also be added. Without these two ingredients, how can the effects of ginseng and astragalus be realized, or the qualities of angelica and chuanxiong support blood and energy, helping to unblock the meridians and reinforce the severe deficiency to achieve effective results? Furthermore, since the aforementioned condition occurs between the bones and joints, a critical area, treating it hastily without promoting blood and energy circulation can lead to stagnation and form pus, causing a leak that exhausts the vital essence, disrupting the natural process of regeneration. Additionally, one may experience conditions caused by exposure to the cold in autumn and summer that lead to internal heat, thus developing abscesses in the bones. If wind attacks the joints, causing deep pain in the bones, especially aggravated by the cold, applying heat may provide slight relief, but it is essential to use a large dose of wind-dispelling soup, and also to crush and spread garlic on the affected area, covering it with mugwort and burning it. Even if the garlic deteriorates, the breaking of the skin is not a concern. If the condition does not improve after a long time and if yin is generated causing yang to rupture and leak fluids, it can result in localized atrophy or leakage conditions; in such cases, one should take internal sealing powder and apply aconite moxibustion. If the pulse is strong and thirst is present, it should not be treated, for it indicates a deficiency of genuine vital energy and an excess of pathogenic energy.<a id="trans-458p" href="#orig-458p" class="marker">[458p]</a><br>At Juyong Pass, Wang Huishige experienced swelling in one arm, which was not painful or red, yet the pulse was weak and he had little appetite, occasionally vomiting. He was treated with Liu Junzi Decoction, supplemented with Agastache and wine-fried Peony root, which stopped the vomiting and allowed him to eat. He then took Ba Zhen Decoction for over twenty doses, resulting in the formation of pus that was drained; he was later cured with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. </p>
<p>The following year, after suffering a chill from a fever, his arm remained slightly swollen and painful, attributed to residual toxins from the fever. However, there were no surface symptoms, just general weakness. Initially, I used Shi Xuan San for four doses to support the vital energy with Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica, and Chuanxiong, while Fangfeng, Platycodon, Bai zhi, and Houpu were used to disperse the swelling; cinnamon was used to invigorate the channels and break up the blood stasis, leading to a reduction in swelling after three to four treatments. He subsequently took Ba Zhen Decoction, and the pus was resolved, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>By winter, his arm began to hurt again after taking wind-dispelling medicine, resulting in severe muscle cramps. I believed that this was due to a deficiency of blood that could not nourish the muscles, and the weakness in the muscles could not support the bones. Therefore, I prescribed an enhanced Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction for a hundred doses, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-459p" href="#orig-459p" class="marker">[459p]</a><br>Wang Wenyuan suffered from swelling and pain in his arm. After taking cold and cooling medicine, he experienced a loss of appetite and ineffective bowel movements. I prescribed two doses of the Lizhong pill, and further treated him with Six-Gentlemen Decoction, adding sandalwood and patchouli, which led to an improvement and eventual recovery after the pus discharged. Generally, for severe pain due to abscesses, if the person has a robust constitution with excess internal heat, then bitter and cold medications are advisable; if the constitution is weaker, then one should use the Middle-Boosting and Energy-Increasing Decoction, adding herbs like Scutellaria and Coptis. For those who are overweight and experiencing painful abscesses, it is best to use herbs like Vitex, Saposhnikovia, and Notopterygium, as they are known to dispel wind and overcome dampness.</p>
<p>A woman in her twenties, after meals, would often experience sour regurgitation and bloating, accompanied by swollen heels when she was angry. She did not respond to medications like the Yueju pill. This was due to a deficiency in the spleen and downward movement of dampness. I prescribed Six-Gentlemen Decoction along with fennel, sandalwood, patchouli, and fried ginger over several doses, which led to slight recovery. I then continued with several doses of Six-Gentlemen Decoction, resulting in her complete recovery.<a id="trans-460p" href="#orig-460p" class="marker">[460p]</a><br>Chen, the envoy, was over fifty years old. In winter, he suffered from an abscess in his leg, with a rapid pulse, restlessness, coldness, and constipation; the swelling and pain were severe. This was due to internal heat. The treatment involved cool herbs and an increased dose of Huangqin to bring down the condition; subsequently, he was cured with Siwu Decoction plus Huangqin.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu, a man from Beijing, was over thirty years old. He was generally timid and weak, unable to eat cold food. He had a toxic condition in his arm with a weak pulse. I treated him with purgative medicine, leading to an outbreak. However, he had reduced appetite or experienced bloating and sourness, gradually becoming emaciated. Ginseng and Poria didn&#39;t help, but the pulse on the right wrist was weak; this indicated a decline in the fire of the Mingmen, which couldn’t generate earth. Therefore, I used Bawei Pill to tonify the earth, and gradually his appetite improved and he recovered. He also experienced pain in both knees, leading to pain in all joints—women suffering from blood wind and men from soft wind. This is known as wind-damp bi, also called joint pain. It should be treated with Fuzi Bawuzhong Decoction with modifications.</p>
<p>A woman had an abscess in her arm, with a purple and depressed wound and clear pus that wouldn’t close. She thought the poison hadn’t been completely expelled and wanted to take medication to expel the poison. I explained that for the condition of sores, if the swelling was hard and the pus thick, it was real; if the swelling was soft and the pus thin, it was deficient. I used a Fuzi cake for moxibustion along with administering a hundred doses of the Shiquan Dabu Decoction, after which she began to recover.<a id="trans-461p" href="#orig-461p" class="marker">[461p]</a><br>Cao Jiangdu, the chief official, suffered from an abscess on the left foot next to the little toe. The pain was unbearable, and he urgently underwent over thirty treatments of garlic moxibustion, which allowed him to walk. Eager for a speedy recovery, he applied a cooling medicine, which led to blood coagulation and necrosis in the flesh, causing the toxic effects to intensify. After another hundred moxibustion treatments and taking a revitalizing potion, he expelled purple blood, indicating that the poison was beginning to resolve. However, the sole of his foot became severely ulcerated, with much rotten sinew and flesh. Just as he was about to recover, I had to return north for work, and he inadvertently used flesh-repairing medicine, which only aggravated the poison and depleted his vital energy, making the wound difficult to heal. Upon my return, I used a treatment to restore him, pleased with his robust constitution, and after staying in the guest house for over three months, he finally healed.</p>
<p>My cousin Zhifu had an abscess on the little finger of his right hand. Initially, he attempted to drain it with a needle, applying a cooling medicine, which caused his palm and finger to swell three to four times their normal size, and his pulse was greatly forceful. This indicated that true energy was being depleted, while evil energy prevailed. I first administered a life-saving pill and two doses of a revitalizing potion, which slightly alleviated his condition. While I was away, he further punctured to drain blood, causing the swelling to extend to his forearm and wrist like a large gourd, with his fingers swelling multiple times, unable to rupture—this indicated a further depletion of true energy and an increase in evil energy. Upon my return, I used a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, along with frequent moxibustion across his hand, gradually reducing the swelling. Later, he experienced insufficient bowel movements and often felt weak, indicating his vital energy was sinking. I supplemented him with a tonic soup, adding herbs like psoralea, nutmeg, evodia, and schisandra, and replaced tea with a revitalizing powder. His bowel movements gradually improved, and the back of his hand began to resolve; he subsequently took over fifty doses of strong tonics until he recovered.<a id="trans-462p" href="#orig-462p" class="marker">[462p]</a><br>A neighbor, Su Zi, encountered a condition in which his left hand showed signs of a boil, feeling numb and itchy, experiencing chills and fever, nausea, and the left side of his body was entirely numb, with an irregular pulse. I said: Generally, sores should not be painless; they should not be overly painful. If there is agitation, it should not be treated. Now, presented with numbness and especially itching, this is particularly bad. I administered two doses of a life-threatening pill, which showed no effect. I then used a detoxifying agent, and the itching began to subside, but then it developed into swelling and pain. I remarked: Although the situation seems dire, the presence of pain is a good sign. However, the toxic qi must be released; I want to use acupuncture. Just then, it was the time of the full moon, and his family only mentioned the spirit in his buttocks, refusing to comply, resulting in further swelling. I insisted on acupuncture, and all symptoms immediately receded; then I used the detoxifying agent, and the sore healed completely.</p>
<p>A man had a carbuncle on the outer side of his leg, which was swelling and causing severe pain. I prescribed a decoction of astragalus wine twice, which alleviated it somewhat. I then used a dispersing powder several times, which caused it to rupture and heal.<a id="trans-463p" href="#orig-463p" class="marker">[463p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a leg abscess for a long time without improvement. The sore&#39;s edge was purple and sunken, with clear and thin pus, which I diagnosed as weakness. She did not believe me and took a toxic remedy, which worsened her condition, leading to further requests for treatment. I recommended moxibustion with aconite poultice and over a hundred doses of a nourishing tonic, after which she recovered. In cases where pus is thin and does not heal or is sunken, it indicates severe deficiency of qi and blood, which requires substantial tonification; otherwise, it leads to complications or failure. If she suffers from other ailments afterward, treatment becomes even more difficult.</p>
<p>Another woman experienced pain in both legs and could not stretch them. Her pulse was tense and tight, and pressing on it felt brittle. I first administered two doses of Wujisan, which slightly relieved her pain; a third dose completely stopped it, and after taking Shenyin Yangzhen Decoction, she could bend and stretch again.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from foot qi, with occasional leg swelling and muscle cramps, accompanied by abdominal pain. Various medications were ineffective, and her condition gradually worsened. Various texts state that the Eight Flavor Pill treats foot Shaoyin qi disorders, which cause abdominal pain and shortness of breath leading to a crisis. I administered a dose, which provided rapid relief, and she recovered after further doses. People with weak and cold kidney channels often have this condition, where the kidney overacts on the heart, leading to water overcoming fire, and it can be fatal if not quickly addressed.</p>
<p>A man had leg pain combined with muscle cramps and bone pain, with a tense pulse. I prescribed two doses of Dāfángfēng Decoction, which reduced the cramps; after another two doses, the swelling diminished. However, one area still hurt, and the pulse was no longer tense, indicating that the cold evil had departed, but there was still stagnant, turbid material that was likely forming pus, hence the persistent pain. I used a few doses of a detoxifying remedy; the swelling appeared, the pulse became slippery and rapid, indicating that pus had formed. Acupuncture was applied, and after taking the nourishing tonic for over a month, he felt secure.<a id="trans-464p" href="#orig-464p" class="marker">[464p]</a><br>A man initially experienced pain in his legs, which later spread to all four limbs, fluctuating and worsening at night. He took a remedy to eliminate dampness and dispel toxins, but it had no effect. His pulse was slippery and thin, indicating that damp phlegm and turbid blood were the issues. He was treated with Erchen Decoction, adding Cangzhu, Qianghuo, Taoren, Honghua, Niuxi, and Cao Wu, and he recovered. For all cases of damp phlegm and damp heat, or stagnant blood accumulating in the joints, without the use of acrid and warm remedies to open the pores, promote circulation, and harmonize Qi and blood, how can one expect to recover?</p>
<p>Another man had leg pain, which was associated with excess phlegm that sometimes produced a gurgling sound. His pulse was slippery and rapid. He was treated with Erchen Decoction, adding Shengma, Erzhur, Zexie, Qianghuo, and Nanshen, and he found relief.</p>
<p>A man experienced pain in his shins and ankles, treated successfully with a modified remedy for dispelling toxins.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from pain in both legs, with a pulse that was thin and rapid, indicating blood deficiency combined with damp heat. Initially, she was treated with several herbs including Cangzhu, Huanglian, Zhi Mu, Longdancao, Fuling, Fangfeng, Fuling, and Qianghuo, leading to gradual improvement in her swollen and painful condition. She was later given Siwu Decoction with added Erzhur, Huanglian, Niuxi, and Mugua, and was completely healed after about a month.</p>
<p>Another man had swollen and painful joints, with a pulse that was slow and rapid, indicating damp heat. He received a modified version of Jingfang Baidu San with two doses of Ma Huang, which reduced the pain by half. He was then given four doses of Binglang Baidu San, which also alleviated the swelling. Lastly, he received several doses of Siwu Decoction with Erzhur, Niuxi, and Mugua, leading to full recovery.<a id="trans-465p" href="#orig-465p" class="marker">[465p]</a><br>A woman experienced swelling and pain in her legs, along with chills and fever, and her pulse was floating and rapid. This indicated damp-heat from the three Yang channels affecting the exterior. She was treated with a modified version of the Bai Du San, but there was no response, indicating the presence of stagnant blood that the medicine could not reach. Therefore, they used acupuncture to remove the stagnant blood at the affected site and continued with the previous medicine for two more doses, resulting in improvement. They then used Dang Gui Nian Tong Tang for four doses, which led to recovery. Yang Dashou said: &quot;Leg Qi is caused by blockage. The treatment should facilitate the flow to prevent stagnation.&quot; Once stagnation occurs and worsens, the stagnant blood should be removed to eliminate its force. The classics say: &quot;If accumulation occurs, there will be swelling and heat. After acupuncture, treat with medicine.&quot;</p>
<p>A woman suffered from pain in both legs, which would cramp upon exposure to cold. Her pulse was wiry and tense, indicating a symptom of cold evil. She was treated with Wujisuan facing Si Wu Tang for several doses, which relieved the pain. Afterward, she took Si Wu Tang with added papaya, achyranthes, and zhi ke for over a month, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man had swollen legs with cramps, making it difficult for him to move. He was treated with Jiao Jia San for two doses and recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had leg pain that prevented her from bending or stretching, and it worsened with wind and cold; no medicines worked, and she suffered greatly. Initially, she took one pill of Huo Luo Dan and immediately improved, and continued the treatment until she recovered. The following year, the pain recurred, but taking one pill again alleviated most of the pain, and she then took Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang for four doses and recovered.</p>
<p>A man who had a history of leg Qi also suffered from an abcess in the bone, causing pain. After taking Huo Luo Dan for nine doses, both conditions resolved.</p>
<p>A woman had swelling and pain in her limbs and joints, particularly severe in her shins and feet. She occasionally experienced spontaneous sweating or headaches, which were caused by damp-heat in the Tai Yang channel. She was treated with Ma Huang Zuo Jing Tang for two doses and recovered.<a id="trans-466p" href="#orig-466p" class="marker">[466p]</a><br>A woman suffered from hemorrhoids and leg pain that felt like numbness, caused by deficiency of yin blood that could not nourish the muscles.

<p>A woman suffered from muscle spasms and numbness, with weakness in both legs that impaired her ability to walk. She was treated with the San Yin Sheng Jun Pill and recovered.</p>
<p>A woman experienced leg pain coupled with cramps in her feet and shins; taking dispersing medicines made her condition worse. Her pulse was tight, indicating weakness in the kidneys and liver, with internal invasion of wind and dampness. She was treated with the Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction which alleviated her pain, and further treated with the Shen Ying Yang Zhen Dan which prevented recurrence of spasms.</p>
<p>A man who habitually had leg pain exacerbated by dietary indiscretions experienced increased pain, fatigue, and weak pulse. He was treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction augmented with hawthorn, shen qu, and other herbs, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A man who ate very little experienced discomfort in the chest and abdomen, sometimes felt sour after eating, and had pain in both legs. He took two doses of the Daoyin Pill which produced immediate relief. Afterwards, he was treated with the Six Gentlemen Decoction reinforced with shen qu, cang zhu, and malt in over twenty doses, resulting in no further problems.</p>
<p>Wang Shiheng from Jintai, over forty years old, suffered from toxic pain in his arm and severe vomiting. After taking detoxifying medicines that worsened his symptoms, I prescribed Liang Ge San in two doses which immediately alleviated his condition, followed by the Four Substance Decoction enhanced with qin and lian in four doses to resolve it. This condition was indicative of swelling and sores caused by heat and toxins attacking the heart, leading to vomiting.<a id="trans-467p" href="#orig-467p" class="marker">[467p]</a><br>A man named Shao, who worked as a door attendant, had a painful lump on his hand. After half a year, it ruptured to form a small hole, about the size of a grain, and it did not heal for over a year. Clear pus would ooze out daily, sometimes three or four drops, his face was red, his pulse was rapid, and his mouth was dry. At night he would have fever, while during the day he felt cold. His mobility remained normal, indicating that both his qi and blood were deficient, yet he refused treatment. After more than a month, he had an encounter elsewhere. That person said: &quot;The child has the power of no medicine.&quot; I replied: &quot;It is the excess heat that brings joy.&quot; Eventually, he indeed passed away.</p>
<p>Another man had a boil on his leg, with pus already formed. I used a needle to drain about two bowls of pus and administered a decoction to support the inner organs. He developed a high fever; then I gave him two doses of Shengyu decoction, which brought it to a stop. The next day, he had chills and no appetite, with a pulse as fine as a thread. After giving him one tael of ginseng, three slices of cooked fuzi, simmered with ginger and jujube, he recovered. However, he had a slight loss of appetite and insomnia, so I gave him an internal restorative decoction with astragalus, which helped him stabilize.</p>
<p>In Shanxi, Song Yan, over thirty years old, suffered from a boil on his arm that ruptured but was painless, with thin pus and a weak pulse. Danxi noted that a deep and painless boil indicates that the stomach qi is severely deficient and cannot feel pain. Dongyuan noted that thin and clear pus, along with an unhealed sore, indicates that both qi and blood are deficient. Strong restorative medicine should be used for treatment. He did not listen and took antiseptic medicines, which severely depleted his qi and blood, leading to his failure to recover. Danxi remarked: &quot;Once swelling and pain are seen, with a weak pulse, it is necessary to give nourishment; if qi and blood are not depleted, a good resolution can be preserved. Furthermore, both internal and external ulcers being deficient, treatment should primarily focus on replenishing and healing.&quot;<a id="trans-468p" href="#orig-468p" class="marker">[468p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a lump on her arm that did not heal for a long time, experiencing alternating chills and fever, with vexation in her five hearts, decreased appetite, and obstruction of her menstrual flow. After taking Xiaoyao Powder for over a month, there was no effect; then she took Eight Treasures Decoction with added Danpi and Xiangfu, and after more than a month, her menstrual flow was restored. Later, with the addition of Huangqi and Bailian, she was cured after more than two months.</p>
<p>A person had a tuberculosis-like lump on the arm extending to the neck, resembling scrofula. This was treated as rheumatism by using modified Xiaoxuming Decoction and Duhuo Jisheng Decoction, along with strong tonification herbs such as ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria to expedite recovery. It was noted that although there was no pulse evidence, it was recognized and treated as rheumatism, indicating there must have been observable symptoms at that time. Ultimately, the use of tonics led to recovery, showing it was fundamentally a case of deficiency.</p>
<p>A three-year-old boy had a painful toxic condition in his arm. He took detoxification pills and applied Shen Gong Powder, which led to resolution. There was also a similar case of arm toxicity that caused closed sores and restlessness; he took Wufu Huadu Dan with effect. When pus formed, it was urgent to lance it, using a paper twist dipped in sesame oil to moisten the wound, then apply a medicated plaster. If the child was calm, there was no need for medication, and it was advisable to wait for the pus to be discharged before applying the plaster.</p>
<p>A person with a sore on the arm had a rapid pulse. After drinking one dose of Sophora Flower wine, the heat subsided; subsequently, more than ten doses of honeysuckle, astragalus, and licorice were administered, leading to recovery. The efficacy of Sophora Flower in treating damp-heat conditions is particularly swift, but it should not be overdosed in cases of gastric cold.<a id="trans-469p" href="#orig-469p" class="marker">[469p]</a><br>Yin, from a poor family, suffered in both body and spirit. Since childhood, he had been ill, and in early winter, he developed sores along the Hand Yangming Large Intestine channel. By the fourth day, the pus was thick, and his arm was swollen and painful. The pulses on both sides of the Hand Yangming were taut; when pressed, they were strong and full yet slow. This was caused by changes due to the &#39;Eight Winds.&#39; The pulse indicated that the evil Qi was on the surface; his appetite remained normal, and his bowel movements were unchanged. His abdomen felt balanced, his mouth could taste, indicating the problem was not internal. He did not fear wind or cold, only felt heat and restlessness; the pulse was not floating, suggesting the problem was not superficial. Both exterior and interior balanced, the evil was in the tendons and meridians. Hence, it was said that stagnation in the blood vessels causes boils. The boils appeared above halfway on the body, thus the wind influenced him from above, leading to changes due to the Eight Winds. The sores were confined to the meridians, so it was necessary to dispel cold and harmonize the blood and Qi in the meridians to remove any stagnation for healing. The appropriate remedy was Bai Zhi Sheng Ma Decoction. In this formula, the focus is on the entire body, thus Yangming pertains to the body as a whole. If discussing each channel, Yangming also has formulas for exterior and interior conditions. Sun Yang has its own treatments for both aspects, and the other channels can be similarly inferred.</p>
<p>One person had swollen and painful arms; after taking a tonic, the condition worsened daily. I concluded that the swelling was due to dampness and the pain to heat. This indicated humid heat infiltrating the meridians. I used Ren Shen Bai Du San, adding Wei Ling Xian, Jiu Huang Qin, and Nan Xing over several doses to gradually improve; I then supplemented Si Wu Tang with Cang Zhu, Huang Bo, and Jie Geng in over twenty doses to alleviate the condition. The initial tonic worsened the symptoms, thus a damp-heat treatment was implemented.<a id="trans-470p" href="#orig-470p" class="marker">[470p]</a><br>A man initially suffered from sores on his limbs, which later spread all over his body, resembling but not quite resembling scabies. At times, pus would ooze profusely, particularly from his legs. He experienced severe fatigue, itching, and a feeling of heat; he did not recover for over a year. I diagnosed him with deficient kidney fire and treated him with a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill, which led to his recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Effective Remedies&quot; states: Dong Shouyue recommended treating athlete&#39;s foot by taking several rice snails, crushing them, and applying the mixture to the inner thighs; one would then feel a cool sensation descending to the feet, relieving the condition. The property of snails is to separate and clarify the dampness, thus healing the wet heat of athlete&#39;s foot.</p>
<p>In Piling, there was a man named Ma who sold wine and had long been troubled by wind in his kidneys. One of his feet had swollen like a gourd, and from his waist down, he was uniformly swollen. The pain was unbearable; he could only lie down and had to be assisted by two people to move. Someone suggested using a needle or knife to relieve it. I prescribed Gan Bie Powder for him. By the early hours of the morning, after chewing it with rice and drinking water, he produced several liters of pus that resembled crystal, and immediately the pain ceased and the swelling reduced. A month later, he still needed crutches to walk. I then applied Chi Wu Powder to his knee, which ultimately cured him. Ten years later, when I passed through Piling, he brought his son to express his gratitude, saying that the foot ailment had not recurred and the wind in his kidneys had disappeared; he could now walk briskly without suffering.<a id="trans-471p" href="#orig-471p" class="marker">[471p]</a><br>At the Jiezhu Temple in Shaoxing, a monk, who had been ill for several years and could not walk due to his condition, recovered after taking a medicinal pill. This method was also passed down by the elder Heng.</p>
<p>A person with a body full of excess fat began to suffer from leg edema. His head, face, and limbs exhibited slight swelling, all of which were red. His legs and feet were red and swollen, causing unbearable pain that made him afraid to use support. The pain intensified when his hands touched his skin, leading him to sit and then lie down repeatedly, suffering day and night, unable to describe his distress. Being in the cold North, he often drank alcohol, which over time damaged his spleen and hindered his digestion, contributing to the issue with his legs.</p>
<p>I administered a decoction of Angelica (Danggui) and pain-relief herbal soup weighing about 40 grams, which reduced his pain by half. After taking it again, all swelling and pain disappeared, leaving only slight redness and swelling in his right hand&#39;s fingers. Using a three-edged needle to prick the tips of his fingers released a lot of dark blood, and the redness and swelling completely subsided. </p>
<p>A few days later, after eating moist foods, he felt pain in his limbs again. I then prescribed half a dose of prickly ash, three doses of rhubarb cooked in liquor, one and a half doses of notopterygium, and one dose of Angelica, boiled in water and taken warm. This relieved his symptoms and his pain stopped.<a id="trans-472p" href="#orig-472p" class="marker">[472p]</a><br>In the year of Dingyou, in Lin&#39;an, during a time of extreme heat, I saw Wu Kuanfu using fire to heat a cloth bag to warm his feet. I inquired about it, and he replied: &quot;I have long suffered from foot ailments. Recently, I obtained a remedy using two or three pounds of Sichuan pepper, which I placed in a cloth bag and heated with fire. I then pressed my feet on the pepper bag.&quot; He explained that the properties of the pepper are hot and can dispel cold and dampness. This made a lot of sense; after using it for over a month, I gradually saw improvement. </p>
<p>In the year of Gengzi, in Chun&#39;an, Kuanfu passed by again. I asked about his ailment, and he said: &quot;I&#39;ve been cured for quite some time, thanks to the power of the pepper bag. Not only was it effective for me, but I passed it on to several relatives, and they are all well now. It truly is a miraculous formula.&quot; </p>
<p>In the year of Renyin, I returned to Lin&#39;an, and while staying at an inn, I unexpectedly met Captain Wang Cheng, who was also using fire to heat a cloth bag. I asked him, &quot;Is it not pepper?&quot; He replied: &quot;I also added a third of broken areca nut and a third of dried mugwort.&quot; He added, &quot;Indeed, it is remarkable.&quot; </p>
<p>Generally speaking, ailments of the feet and knees reside in the lower yin region, which is particularly prone to cold and dampness. The cold causes blood and qi to stagnate and congeal, and only heat can eliminate it. Now, by using the hot properties of Sichuan pepper and combining it with steam, the cold and dampness are naturally dispelled. Truly, the wisdom of the remedy is evident.<a id="trans-473p" href="#orig-473p" class="marker">[473p]</a><br>The text from &quot;Medical Form Considerations&quot; states: In the Tang Dynasty, Liu Zihou&#39;s &quot;Rescue from Death&quot; mentions that in the twelfth year of the Yuanheng reign, in the second month, he contracted beriberi, which led to a hard lump the size of a stone in his left side, nearly resulting in death. Due to the severe cold, he was unresponsive, and his family mourned him. However, Zhongying Zheng Xunmei transmitted a cypress wood soup, which he consumed for half a meal; afterwards, he had three significant bowel movements, and the blockages dissipated. He was nearly dead but ended up surviving. Fearing for others who might similarly suffer from ailments like his, he decided to pass on this remedy.</p>
<p>Regarding Gu Anzhong from Guangde, he had long suffered from beriberi, experiencing tight tendons and swollen legs, making it challenging to walk. One day, he arrived at Huzhou and boarded a boat where a bag of items had been there already. The pain in his leg intensified, and upon resting it on the bag, he felt a slight relief from the pain, and his tendons relaxed. He then asked the boatman what was in the bag, and was told it contained Xuan melon. From that moment on, his beriberi suddenly improved. Ah! The medicinal properties being able to cure illnesses through such interactions indicates that the application of medicine should indeed be tailored to the patient&#39;s condition.<a id="trans-474p" href="#orig-474p" class="marker">[474p]</a><br>&quot;The Authentic Text on Surgery&quot; states: A man nearing fifty had a small finger on his right foot that initially grew like a grain of millet, gradually turning into a white blister, and began to hurt after three days. Upon consultation, the head was already rotten, and one finger was swollen and purple, indicating a form of gangrene. He was treated with thirteen applications of moxa fire, causing intense pain before it stopped. Needles were then used for acupuncture at the top, and a toad fat cake was applied and covered with a medicated plaster. On the swollen finger, a thin needle was used to pierce seven or eight spots to release toxic blood, and a concentrated ointment made from toad fat was applied. An external medicated powder was spread to protect healthy flesh from further invasion. At that time, the patient had a rapid pulse, experienced chills and fever, felt nauseous, and was fatigued. First, a ginseng decoction was used to alleviate the surface symptoms, followed by a Huanglian Decoction to facilitate bowel movements, which also relieved the nausea and heat. A detoxifying powder with honeysuckle and ox knee was taken several times, along with Bawei Pill in the morning and a wax alum pill in the evening, combining these treatments together to disperse the toxic energy with the help of heat. Needles were additionally used for detoxification, preventing the condition from deteriorating, thus turning the toxins into pus and allowing the swelling to subside. Later, a Shiquan Dabu Decoction was administered with additions like mountain fruit, five flavors, and Ophiopogon to regulate the body for a month until recovery. If this infection had not been treated with acupuncture and moxibustion to release the toxins, and if solely relied on medicinal applications without harsh remedies to attack and purge, it would have surely harmed the fundamental energy. How then could one expect to protect against the encroachment of toxins and achieve a state of peace? According to &quot;The Authentic Text on Surgery,&quot; Volume Two, this is a supplement.<a id="trans-475p" href="#orig-475p" class="marker">[475p]</a><br>A merchant had a purple blister appear on the second toe of his right foot, with extraordinary itch and pain. The next day, his toenail was completely purple and the flesh black. Upon examination, it was found to be the poison of the liver and kidney meridians. He asked: &quot;What is the distinction?&quot; I replied: &quot;The nail is the residual energy of the liver; when it is purple, it signifies that the liver has been poisoned. The bone is the residual energy of the kidney; when the kidney is damaged, the bone turns black. This reasoning is very clear.&quot; He inquired: &quot;What caused this?&quot; I explained: &quot;Generally, when a person exhausts their strength and injures their tendons, it affects the liver; when they recklessly take heating medicines, it harms the kidneys.&quot; A bystander interjected: &quot;This is indeed true.&quot; It turns out that he had long resided as a guest, associating closely with courtesans, with very deep affections involved, and he exerted himself greatly to please them. Every night, he also took invigorating pills, expecting to have frequent encounters, and it had been two years since he engaged in this. His earlier statements directly pointed to the cause of his illness. The strain from labor and the heating medicine had indeed harmed his kidneys and tendons, making his condition especially perilous and wanting to refuse treatment. He sorrowfully pleaded for assistance, wishing for a chance to return home alive, and repeatedly sought a cure. I pondered over this once again.<a id="trans-476p" href="#orig-476p" class="marker">[476p]</a><br>First, take more than ten strands of hair from a prostitute and twist them into a thread to bind the afflicted fingertip. Then place moxa sticks on the purple-tinted area where they are bound, spacing them evenly in three places, and apply seven cauterizations to each, along with toad venom cakes on top. Afterward, endure the swelling and pain without unbinding the hair. By the next night, the fingertip had turned black, indicating that the flesh, skin, and bone were all dead. A sharp knife was then used to remove the affected fingertip along its joint, revealing a cold and foul substance. It was prepared in a sweet licorice soup for a long wash, waiting for the bruised blood to disperse, after which a hemostatic powder was applied. The next day, the purple discoloration had not receded, and fearing it would spread, a divine lamp was used to illuminate the area. When the blood dispersed and the skin contracted, a mixture of toad venom pills was prepared, adding a lot of sea sheep, grinding it into a paste for application, morning and evening. The swelling did not recur, the purple turned red, and the red formed pus. Externally, he used medicines to promote flesh growth, relieve pain, activate blood flow, and constrict the area. Additionally, he boiled ginseng, atractylodes, and rehmannia into a paste, taking it in the morning to replenish vital essence, a spleen-strengthening medicine at noon to restore stomach qi, and in the evening, a golden elixir pill to detoxify the medicine. After regulating for three months, he was cured. Later, someone asked, “Why bind it with hair from a prostitute?” I replied, “Her hair is a thing of the heart&#39;s connection. Since it is tied to flesh, although painful, it is not truly painful. It is also as if she is present, expressing the feelings involved.”<a id="trans-477p" href="#orig-477p" class="marker">[477p]</a><br>A middle-aged woman, overweight, had been suffering from thirst for three years. Her right index finger became numb and itchy, and a small blister formed between her fingers after a month. Subsequently, the finger gradually swelled, causing unbearable pain and swelling. Upon examination, the original blister area had developed black spots, and half of her finger had turned purple-black. This was a severe case of excess Yang, leading to necrosis. The pulse was large, rapid, and powerful, contrary to what is usually observed in overweight individuals. </p>
<p>Upon inquiring about this woman, it was learned that she had previously lived in wealth without offspring and indulged in rich foods, using a heated charcoal stove, while also frequently consuming hot medicinal herbs. After losing her husband in midlife, her family assets were depleted by her heirs, leading her to harbor long-standing worries. Later, she lived together with her widowed mother, steeped in loneliness. This reflected a transition from wealth to poverty, with unfulfilled wishes, indicating a loss of honor, making treatment unjustifiable. The woman&#39;s mother and child pleaded repeatedly, but I was unable to help them. I eventually followed the treatment methods of Master Sun: to cut the flesh or excise the finger; there was no other remedy.<a id="trans-478p" href="#orig-478p" class="marker">[478p]</a><br>He was willing to comply. First, he used a ginseng nourishing decoction, then took a soft silk strip about a foot long and wrapped it tightly around the place of the blackened flesh at the joint, gradually tightening it to prevent blood flow. Next, he used a sharp knife to cut at the joint, soaking the hand in warm licorice tea for a while; the bleeding was not excessive, and the pain was not severe. The patient said, &quot;Only my heart fears; I do not know the pain from the cut, as if aided by divine power.&quot; I responded, &quot;What is feared is the cut that does not hurt; this signifies that the vital energy, blood, muscles, and bones are all deceased. Though this matter has been removed, recovery is not yet possible.&quot; </p>
<p>I usually used Eight-Flavored Pills combined with a large dose of ginseng and Ophiopogon, boiling them to first restore the kidney essence; then supporting the spleen and stomach; occasionally using a medicinal formulation of gold and earth to detoxify. After three days, the area being bandaged gradually relaxed to reopen the blood vessels, applying red and black ointments to the fresh flesh to alleviate pain. Later, the back of the hand and palm gradually became swollen, with severe ominous signs, yet not blackened; this was due to the internal poison being expelled. The method of using a divine lamp was continued, along with pig&#39;s trotter soup for rinsing. Subsequently, several heads of the swelling emerged, discharging pus and blood without count. Two months later, the original swelling began to subside slightly, and the filthiness also reduced. Afterward, using ginseng and wormwood ointment along with ginseng nourishing decoction, he continued treatment for another half year, finally achieving stability. Although the woman survived, she had lost all five fingers.<a id="trans-479p" href="#orig-479p" class="marker">[479p]</a><br>A male servant, in the harsh cold of winter, had to walk barefoot on the ground as directed by his master, and did not dare to move. As a result, his feet became numb with blood, and the next day all his toes turned purple. After several days, they turned completely black and remained numb without pain. Upon examination, I insisted on using warming and blood-activating treatments, such as medicated baths, but they proved ineffective. Eventually, all ten fingers were at risk of detaching, and an additional segment of blackened foot joints became very painful. The master feared it might turn into gangrene. I said: this seems to be the case, but it is not fundamentally so; there should be no worry. I advised the patient to regularly use moxa from mulberry wood, which would warm and invigorate the blood, as well as resolve the stagnation of toxins. Gradually, his condition would decay and fall off, but would not escape. Internally, I prescribed tonics for the spleen and blood, and externally, two ointments to promote muscle growth. He would recover completely within a hundred days.<a id="trans-480p" href="#orig-480p" class="marker">[480p]</a><br>A maid, twelve years old, quite beautiful, was disliked by her new mistress for her large feet. The mistress tightly wrapped her feet with cloth and sewed them with thread, causing unbearable swelling and pain. When the maid complained, the mistress ignored her. After half a month, foul liquid began to flow from her feet. Upon inspection, the front halves of both feet were completely black and rotting, with flesh and bone dead. I said: &quot;What is already rotten cannot be revived, but we can save what hasn&#39;t decayed.&quot; First, boil ginseng porridge for her to eat. Then, prepare scallion broth for the maid to soak and wash her affected feet. Change the broth and soak again. For the areas that were rotting but not painful, trim them one by one; for those that were still sensitive to pain, apply a remedy with flower bud stone powder to ensure the rotting parts would heal and the already damaged ones would detach. Internally, administer a restorative tonic to replenish energy, and externally apply a healing ointment to encourage flesh growth. Though she eventually recovered, both feet remained permanently deformed.</p>
<p>A man had what looked like a yellow millet boil between the toes of his right foot. The skin turned purple, causing constant sharp pain, akin to being stabbed with a knife. Upon examining it, it was clearly a case of purulent necrosis. Diagnosing his pulse, it was thin, rapid, and weak, showing kidney deficiency. However, the patient had long been a heavy drinker, with excessive internal heat and a deficient constitution, indicating little chance for successful treatment, which I reluctantly admitted. Eventually, it spread to the top and sole of his foot, causing unbearable pain. His appetite diminished over time, his vitality waned, and two months later, he died in great suffering.<a id="trans-481p" href="#orig-481p" class="marker">[481p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Door Regulations&quot; states: Xu Yue was robust and vigorous, but in previous years, he sustained a slight injury to his index finger, which caused bleeding. He rinsed it with cold water, resulting in blood coagulation that did not disperse, leading to swelling and the discharge of several pints of pus and blood. The small tendons detached in three sections, rendering his finger unusable. Recently, during the autumn moon, he started feeling cold between his two feet; he covered them with heavy blankets, and while the outside felt warm, internally he sensed a chill. </p>
<p>Recently, he experienced pain in the tendons from his heels to his knees, making distant travel inconvenient. An old doctor from the clouds advised him to take the Eight-Flavored Pill, which resonated with his situation. Upon my diagnosis, I found that his pulse was difficult to discern, yet his liver and lung pulses were distinctly large. His illness was significantly advanced, especially in winter, when the wood (spring) falls and the metal (autumn) grows cold; this was particularly unsuitable. The current state of his condition suggests that there will be an inability to approach recovery; the components of the Eight-Flavored Pill, such as cinnamon and aconite, should not be taken lightly. </p>
<p>Why? The tendons are related to the liver. Since the blood nourishing the tendons has already been depleted by the earlier injury to his index finger, there is insufficient nourishment for the tendons and meridians. Furthermore, with frequent anger and movement, the liver fire transmits heat to the tendons, causing the major tendon in the feet to become stiff and short, hence the difficulty in walking. However, the liver primarily governs the lungs; wood is afraid of metal, and thus must rely on and receive support, much like a sovereign. This is why the lung energy must first be cleared, allowing the energy of the whole body to descend. </p>
<p>Now, with the lung pulse being large, the lung energy is then harmed by the heart, leading to blockage and lack of clarity, which subsequently prevents the yang energy from descending, hence the cold in the feet. Therefore, although the ailment seems minor, it has already violated three major principles.<a id="trans-482p" href="#orig-482p" class="marker">[482p]</a><br>Ordinarily, the pulse is fine, but now it is strong; this is the first reversal. The liver pulse is large and heat descends, which is the second reversal. The lung pulse is large and the qi is obstructed upwards, which is the third reversal. If one mistakenly treats this with cassia and aconite, the heat will become hotter, and the obstruction will worsen, leading to atrophy and paralysis. In this situation, the use of medicine involves profound understanding that is usually beyond measure. The tendons are short and tense, and liver qi is internally trapped. One must urgently adhere to the principles of metal cutting wood for harmony; by cutting wood with metal, the wood flourishes in return, and the tendons relax. If one does not thoroughly comprehend the original principles, who can know this? However, if the energy of metal does not become obstructed, wood would not dare to suppress its command. Only when the metal loses its rigidity and turns supple can wood lose its suppleness and become rigid. Therefore, to treat this ailment, one must prioritize clearing the metal as the primary approach.<a id="trans-483p" href="#orig-483p" class="marker">[483p]</a><br>However, Qingjin (clear metal) first prioritizes the clearing of the stomach as its primary principle. If the stomach is not clear, then drinking alcohol will send heat to the lungs, and indulging in rich flavors will send turbid energy to the lungs. How can the medicinal powers possibly overcome the responsibilities of clear metal? If metal is not clear, it is like a great enemy ahead, and the commander is weak; success can no longer be anticipated. Moreover, abandoning clear metal and instead supporting fire to consume metal—acting in reverse—is it truly a remedy? Such actions are bound to lead to failure. The elder viewed the words of medicinal stones as reckless, doubted them as exaggerated, and ultimately took the Eight Flavor Pill. A month later, the symptoms of weakness and paralysis became evident, and unfortunately, what was said proved true. Thus, he lay in bed for a whole year, allowing no servant to see or hear him. In the end, the yang path completely contracted, and there was no small water at all. Thus, the energy of the lung metal was first exhausted from above, resulting in this. It was clearly stated, yet he still proceeded, what can be done, what can be done!<a id="trans-484p" href="#orig-484p" class="marker">[484p]</a><br>In the winter of Gengchen, I glimpsed the teacher&#39;s face at the ancestral garden of Ding Wengong. I secretly observed his body, which was heavy and found it difficult to walk, his complexion was dull, his speech slow, leading me to believe he was suffering from a condition due to excessive worry. In the autumn of Xinsi, during a consultation, I carefully examined him. His spleen pulse was irregular, while the lung pulse was strong; however, the liver energy was still balanced, and the yang energy was still vigorous, which indicated that the evil of the eight winds had not yet taken root. Yet, with the tendons and pulses being strained and painful, causing sleeplessness, it was largely due to wind aggravated by dampness, fueled by his vulnerability. This led me to conclude that he could still receive treatment for some time to come. Why is this? Wind is related to liver ailments, being the energy of heaven; dampness pertains to spleen issues, being the energy of earth. The quickness of heavenly energy causes sudden outbreaks, while the slowness of earthly energy can restrain such outbreaks. Yet, if the energies are different, the ailments will differ, and if the energies converge, the ailments will correlate; this must be clearly discerned. When ailments differ, in relation to heavenly energy, wind is the leader of all diseases. Its onset is subtle and follows a process of mutual restraint, inevitably beginning with the five organs before becoming intense; if it comes on strongly, it strikes directly without following the usual path. Only those with a weakened constitution will find the onset unpredictable. In relation to earthly energy, dampness is an issue of the lower body; if it develops subtly, the ankles become swollen, but once the cause is overcome, it dissipates quickly; if it comes on severely, it affects the skin and muscles, gradually advancing upwards, yet this too concerns those with yang deficiency, starting to rise abnormally. The two are rooted in distinct aspects of heaven and earth, with differing ailments and therefore requiring different treatments. When ailments converge, the energy of heaven enters the tendons, and the energy of earth also enters the tendons.<a id="trans-485p" href="#orig-485p" class="marker">[485p]</a><br>When the weather is favorable, the tendons and meridians become taut and strong; when the earth&#39;s energy is dominant, the tendons and meridians become slack and weak. Although their sources are different, their flow is the same, intermingling and becoming difficult to manage. The wind in the teacher&#39;s room, although initially imperceptible, is subtly felt. As for humidity, it is both brewed internally with rich wine and flavors and externally attacked by hot mist and pestilence; thus, the feet suffer daily, and despite the relaxation of the entire body’s tendons and meridians, there is still discomfort. Ultimately, nothing compares to the ceaseless tugging pain in the feet, with sores and swellings that become unmanageable. The winds of spring, the humidity and heat of summer, and the dryness of autumn—these seasonal influences are all ailments affecting the teacher&#39;s body. And the afflictions of his body reside uniquely in one corner, which is indeed a bitter hardship.<a id="trans-486p" href="#orig-486p" class="marker">[486p]</a><br>If the internal wind, dampness, heat, and dryness are not eliminated, how can one expect to escape from foot ailments? What is commendable is only the cold water in winter, which somewhat reduces the situation. However, doctors do not understand this principle and often prescribe strong medicinal wines to drive out the dampness, unaware that this is merely a method for treating cold dampness, which should only be used when the illness increases in winter. How can one counteract wind-damp and heat-damp with such counterproductive methods without worsening the condition? Moreover, if a person&#39;s lung pulse is vigorous and they have a bowel movement only once every three or four days, and even in winter they enjoy cold drinks and rarely approach fire, how can one deem them affected by cold dampness? Thus, in Sun Zhenren’s prescriptions like the major and minor bamboo juice formulas, remedies for wind, dampness, heat, dryness, and cold are all present, yet they are mixed and complex, leaving later generations entirely unaware of their applications. If one understands this principle of taking and removing, it becomes a profound and enlightened matter. Therefore, how can one not err in prescribing without distinguishing the diagnosis?<a id="trans-487p" href="#orig-487p" class="marker">[487p]</a><br>Mr. Qian Shuweng has a slender physique and typically produces more heat than phlegm. In recent years, internal heat has transformed into phlegm due to dampness. During the summer and autumn of the year of Xin Si, with the heaviness of damp heat, he suddenly experienced numbness in his right foot, which felt as cold as ice or stone. This extreme heat manifested as cold, akin to the phenomenon of icy hail in summer. The physicians, noticing the coldness of his ankle, failed to observe that the cold was due to extreme heat resembling coldness. They erroneously treated him with warming herbs such as cattle knee, papaya, ephedra, the bark of trees, and other warming agents. They even believed that his lower essence was deficient and used substances like cinnamon and aconite for replenishment. Using fire to combat fire and adding heat to heat led to an abscess that festered for several months, rendering the ankle, foot, and toes useless. His treatment continued to worsen, and the situation reached such extremes. The reasoning behind this is quite clear and not difficult to discern. If indeed cold phlegm were to descend, it would merely congeal without dispersing, or at worst, lead to weakness and numbness. How could it possibly result in swelling, ulceration, yellow fluid oozing, and decaying flesh and tendons? Those involved do not recognize the misguided treatment from the physicians and instead attribute the outcomes to a divine retribution from the gods. Could it be so? This closely resembles the symptoms of febrile diseases where pathogenic heat penetrates the meridians, resulting in fluid accumulation—there is little difference. The ginseng paste used can only briefly support the original qi, without any medications to clear and resolve the damp heat as an adjunct, which is why its efficacy remains unremarkable.<a id="trans-488p" href="#orig-488p" class="marker">[488p]</a><br>In holding the office of a senior official, one should not manage complicated affairs. When used together, ginseng strengthens the vital essence while bamboo-leaf juice opens the meridians, enhancing the sweet and cold properties of each. Xu Taiye used ginseng to treat vacuous wind and combined it with the heating properties of aconite. Even today, his tendons and veins are contracted and he finds it difficult to move, due to lack of understanding of how the sweet and cold can open the meridians. Now, after using ginseng paste, the spleen&#39;s Qi has been revitalized and its function enhanced. At this time, if one can moderate their diet, allowing the Yang Qi produced in the spleen to gain strength to expel phlegm and heat, then phlegm-heat will not linger, and the foot ailments can be resolved.<a id="trans-489p" href="#orig-489p" class="marker">[489p]</a><br>On the day of an eclipse, coupled with nighttime eating, even though one&#39;s spleen qi is strong, it is not harmed by food. However, the spleen qi generated by ginseng is not utilized to move phlegm and heat, but is merely used to digest food, which is truly regrettable. Nowadays, food intake also does not easily facilitate movement, which should promote growth but instead leads to decline. Consequently, phlegm and fluid accumulate in the chest, causing fullness and discomfort, leading to coughs with phlegm that does not resolve, all due to the spleen losing its strength and the stomach failing to transport fluids. Instead of aiding digestion, the food leads to phlegm, gradually filling the lung passages, making it difficult to expel the cough. Although treating phlegm is urgent, the medicines used for it often deplete qi and induce weakness, raising concerns that phlegm may not be expelled before wind invades. Only by using sweet, cold medicines to expel wind, eliminate heat, moisten dryness, replenish deficiency, and clear phlegm can one find lawful treatment. As for pungent and hot medicines, they should never be used again. Medical practitioners clearly see this, yet still use cassia and aconite inappropriately, likely believing in their strong drying effect and striving for a quick resolution. What a grave mistake!<a id="trans-490p" href="#orig-490p" class="marker">[490p]</a><br>Qian Xiaolu, a follower of Yi Qiu, was also good at drinking. Every time he played, he would drink, and whenever he drank, he would get drunk, not having a single sober day in the year. Eventually, in autumn, he drank heavily and returned late, vomiting. He experienced chills and fevers, along with pain in his joints. The doctor diagnosed it as a viral cold and treated him with dispersing medicine, but it did not improve. Another doctor recognized it as alcohol poisoning, and employed warming medicines in conjunction with cold ones for treatment, but it also did not work. After lying in bed for more than twenty days, he finally requested my diagnosis. His pulse was large, rapid, and urgent; his body was weak, unable to move or stretch on the mat, his left leg was in pain as if stabbed by a knife, and he had a foul-smelling nasal discharge. Up to this point, he had not had a proper bowel movement, indicating a potential abscess condition. I returned to speak with my two disciples. Wang Sheng joyfully concluded, &quot;So far, the dryness of Metal governs; drinkers inherently injure Damp-Heat, and this leads to the outbreak. When Metal is strong, Wood must weaken.&quot; He explained that the pain in his muscles and bones rendered him unable to rise from bed, and with the viscera being dry, the bowels must also be dry, resulting in desiccated fluids and the large intestine losing its moisture, hence treating with cleansing Metal to moisten dryness would suffice. Wu Sheng disagreed, stating, &quot;On the contrary, the alcohol poison is raging, and the intestines and stomach are ablaze; can he wait to dig a well for water? Immediate drastic purging is essential.&quot;<a id="trans-491p" href="#orig-491p" class="marker">[491p]</a><br>I said: The method may indeed be effective, but the drinker&#39;s stomach is often damaged by excessive vomiting. When medicine enters the stomach, it must cause an upward surge, failing to reach its intended destination. Even methods like applying to the navel and guiding through the intestines are of no use. Digging a well is certainly difficult, and opening a canal is not easy either. Alas! What to do! I will open another avenue for you. Wine is a clear and pure substance; it does not descend with impurities but prefers to seep in. The area of seepage begins from the stomach into the gallbladder, which is the abode of purity, seeking similar energies. However, the gallbladder&#39;s capacity to absorb is limited; next, it flows from the stomach into the intestines, with the bladder seeping it out, converting it into a unique form of excretion. When it reaches this stage of transformation, what remains is the essence of the wine, and its potency is primarily borne by the gallbladder. I have often seen those who drink well, always pouring lightly and sipping slowly, allowing for absorption in the stomach. If one drinks continuously in quick succession, they merely empty their purse. Thus, when wine has reached a moderate level of intoxication, even the timid possess the courage to shout and confront, the poor may have the bravery to gamble everything, the reclusive may dare to break through barriers, and even the fierce may have the audacity to wield a sword and kill, not to mention the hedonistic who may drink in excessive quantities without regard for their life.<a id="trans-492p" href="#orig-492p" class="marker">[492p]</a><br>The small man from Lu, despite his extreme poverty, does not lose heart; is it not due to his dependence on wine? His illness is indeed different from others. The gallbladder does not have a natural outlet. When the gallbladder is hot, others may transfer this heat to the brain, causing mucous to flow freely from the nose, which can reduce this heat somewhat. However, for the small man from Lu, the yang in his body is excessively strong, while the yin is severely deficient, with no hair left, resembling a barren place in the south. The heat is extreme; can he tolerate the heat transferred from the gallbladder? Fortunately, he sweats a lot from his head, and the heat from his brain is released, preventing it from becoming a major issue. Yet, if the heat from the gallbladder cannot be dispersed and is compounded by the heat of wine, along with the dryness of the season, this internal heat will burn intensely, and his pulse is notably rapid; how could he not become exhausted? Therefore, when the heat from the gallbladder overflows and seeps into the meridians, his body and eyes turn yellow, resulting in the illness caused by wine toxicity due to this seepage. It can be diverted and eliminated through the bladder via urination. Now, merely attacking the Huaijiao point cannot drive this out since it is fundamentally linked to the gallbladder, from which there is nothing more to expel.<a id="trans-493p" href="#orig-493p" class="marker">[493p]</a><br>Moreover, the person&#39;s gait has long been affected by this ailment; they have been injured for a long time, with energy depleted and blood scattered, the lingering heat pathogen pervasive. Even if many medications are taken, they are rejected and not assimilated; how can one expect any effect? If one wishes to use acupuncture, this long-injured point presents difficulties in supplementation. The original text used &quot;expel&quot; but was altered for context. The aim is to drain. If a skilled practitioner were encountered, like those in ancient times, what method would they use to treat this? I have further concerns: after the body is established, one relies on the nourishment of grain energy, which is the source energy. If a person has little grain intake and resorts to wine for their source energy, now due to illness they abstain from drinking, what will they rely on for their long-term vitality? I carefully contemplate a method: first, to induce the yellowish fluid from the brain to exit through the nose, then to needle several points along the gallbladder meridian in the brain area, aiming to expel the heat from the gallbladder through the nasal passages. This way, the lingering pathogens in the junction of the legs are gradually mobilized, and the dryness of the intestines and stomach can slowly recover. Afterwards, a medicine to purge the gallbladder heat should be added to wine, allowing for daily indulgence in drunkenness. The method of consumption remains the same, but the nature of the wine varies, so that the yin may flow, and its use becomes exquisite. It is necessary to make use of one’s habitual nature as a stronghold, which must employ wine to serve as guidance for assistance. Can methods focused on cleansing and moistening truly resolve the situation? Two individuals cheeringly stated: &quot;Being taught the treatment methods brings clarity to the heart; please record this to express the joy of sharing knowledge.&quot; I document this for you, to be sent to the young scholar, who is seeking help. The minor difficulties encountered are but obstacles. Do some interpret my words to be incorrect?<a id="trans-494p" href="#orig-494p" class="marker">[494p]</a><br>Huang Hongxuan suddenly developed a carbuncle on his arm, which became swollen, and he suffered extreme headaches. The surgeons all said it was caused by heat and poison. Considering his usual disposition, which is calm and purposeful, and that he has a tranquil mind without any source for generating heat and poison, he could not identify the origin of the ailment. I, the respected elder, also consulted Changshan about the illness; why not set aside the wine and food and consult a skilled cook instead? Chang replied, “Before discussing this condition, let us first offer our congratulations, and then we may speak of it.” </p>
<p>Every sore and ulcer has its cause: external causes include toxic effects of abnormal weather and the contagious filth from daily life. Internal causes include the heat and poison from rich wine and savory foods, and the fiery poison stemming from pent-up anger. The treatment for fire poison differs fundamentally from that for other poisons. Fire and vital energy cannot coexist; therefore, if one counteracts it with cold, the vital energy will surely flow away. For Hongxuan, there were none of these causes present; it was merely a leftover from prenatal poison. </p>
<p>All humans possess the qi of heaven and earth, which differs in purity and turpitude. Only those with pure and refined essence can enjoy boundless blessings and longevity. However, being formed from the essence of their parents, they inevitably carry mixed desires within their physical bodies. What is necessary is a resolution of these impurities through boils and sores, thus expelling the repressed desires from the body, and restoring the pure essence to its natural state. Like gold ore, it must undergo the refining process in a red furnace before the dross and the pure can finally be separated.<a id="trans-495p" href="#orig-495p" class="marker">[495p]</a><br>I have observed those with smallpox using this method: seven or eight days later, when the eyes open, if the black and white are clearly distinguished, it is a sign of pure gold; if there are red veins and a red membrane, it indicates mixed gold. However, if the pupil is blurred and the spiritual light is absent, then it is certainly not gold. Hong Xuan had many smallpox lesions when he was young, and his vital energy could not be revitalized; additionally, he was hindered by various other ailments. Although the fire and poison in the organs had been eliminated, the stagnation in his body still remained. Therefore, the emergence of smallpox sores must occur in the areas around the hands and feet or at the Qu pool, for these spots are devoid of any significant toxic accumulation and allow the subtle poisons to hide in places difficult for air to reach.<a id="trans-496p" href="#orig-496p" class="marker">[496p]</a><br>Today’s sores and boils are precisely situated at the acupoints of the body, raising questions about the toxicity of the pox. The poison lies dormant under the elbows and armpits, posing no harm; however, the pure essence of the body is slightly mixed, akin to dust within a precious mirror or slight blemishes on a flawless jade. Now, the original energy of Taihe fills the entire body, and the residue accumulated over the past fifteen years desires to be expelled as purulent blood. Others see this as toxicity, but I have long foreseen it as a mechanism for recovery. Is it possible to be unhindered in all limbs yet not in one’s undertakings? </p>
<p>The treatment method: externally, apply a decoction of purslane to hasten its rupture; internally, use Baoyuan Decoction to facilitate complete expulsion. Additionally, using the medicinal herbs for treating pox and boils will ensure recovery on the same day, certainly unlike sores and toxins that linger for long durations. However, lacking knowledge about the diagnosis, employing cold, cooling, or fire-clearing medicines to treat the sores would merely worsen the situation. Who says minor ailments in surgery can be handled without knowledgeable intervention? If treated correctly, much purulent fluid will be expelled, and healing will occur without the need for substances that promote flesh regrowth.<a id="trans-497p" href="#orig-497p" class="marker">[497p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　考诸经方，往往有脚弱之论，而古人少有此疾。自永嘉南渡，衣缨士人多有遭者。岭表江东有支法、存仰道人等，并留意经方，偏善斯术，晋朝仕望，多获全济，莫不由此二公。又宋齐之间，有释门深师师道人述法存等诸家旧方，为三十卷，其脚弱一方，近百余首。周魏之代，盖无此病，所以姚公集验，殊不殷勤，徐王撰录，未以为意。特以三方鼎峙，风教未一，霜露不均，寒暑寒暑　原缺，据《千金》卷七补。不等，是以关西河北，不识此疾。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>自圣唐开辟，六合无外，南极之地，襟带是重，爪牙之寄，作镇于彼，不习水土，往者皆遭。近者，中国士大夫虽不涉江表，亦有居然而患之者。良由今代天下风气混同，物类齐等所致之耳。然此病发，初得先从脚起，因即胫肿，时人号为脚气，深师云脚弱者，即其义也。深师述支法存所用永平山敷施莲范祖耀黄素等诸脚弱方，凡八十余条，皆极精要。然学者寻览，颇觉繁重，正是方集耳。卒欲救急，莫测指南。今取其所经用灼然有效者，以备仓卒，余者不复具述。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>　　　　　论何以得之于脚</p>
<p>　　问曰：风毒中人，随处皆得作病，何偏着于脚也？答曰：夫人有五脏，心肺二脏经络所起在手十指，肝肾与脾三脏经络所起在足十趾。夫风毒之气皆起于地，地之寒暑风湿皆作蒸气，足常履之，所以风毒之中人也，必先中脚。久而不瘥，遍及四肢腹背头项也。微时不觉，痼滞乃知。经云，次传间传是也。<br>　　　　　论得已便令人觉否</p>
<p>　　凡脚气病皆由感风毒所致，得此病多不令人即觉，会因他病一度方始发动，或奄然大闷，经两三日不起，方乃觉之。诸小庸医，皆不识此疾，谩作余病治之，莫不尽毙。故此病多不令人识也。始起甚微，食饮嬉戏，气力如故，惟卒起脚屈弱不能动，有此为异耳。黄帝云：缓风湿痹，是也。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>　　　　　论风毒相貌</p>
<p>　　夫有脚气未觉异而头项臂膊已有所苦，有诸处皆悉未知而心腹五内已有所困。又风毒之中人也，或见食呕吐，憎闻食臭，或有腹痛下利，或大小便秘濇不通，或胸中冲悸，不欲见光明’或精神昏愤’或喜迷忘，语言错乱，或壮热头痛，或身体酷冷疼烦，或觉转筋，或脚胫肿或不肿，或(月坒)腿顽痹，或时缓纵不随，或复百节挛急，或小腹不仁，此皆脚气状貌也，亦云风毒脚气之候也。其候难知，当须细意察之，不尔必失其机要。一朝病成，难可以理，妇人亦尔。又有妇人产后，春夏取凉，多中此毒，深宜慎之。其热闷掣瘲，惊悸心烦，呕吐气上，皆其候也。又但觉脐下冷痞，愊愊然不快，兼小便淋沥，不同生平，即是脚气之候。顽弱名缓风，疼痛为湿痹。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>　　　　　论得之所由</p>
<p>　　凡四时之中，皆不得久坐久立湿冷之地，亦不得因酒醉汗出，脱衣靴袜，当风取凉，皆成脚气。若暑月久坐久立湿地者，则热湿之气，蒸人经络，病发必四肢酸疼烦闷。若寒月久坐久立湿冷地者，则冷湿之气，上入经络，病发则四体酷冷转筋。若当风取凉得之者，病发则皮肉顽痹，诸处瞤动，渐渐向头。凡常之日，忽然暴热，人皆不能忍得者，当于此时，必不得顿取于寒以快意也。卒有暴寒，复不得受之，皆生病也。世有勤功力学之士，一心注意于事，久坐行立于湿地，不能动转，冷风来击，入于经络，不觉成病。故风毒中人，或先中手足十指，因汗毛孔开，腠理疏通，风如急箭，或先中足心，或先中足趺，或先中膝已下腨胫表里者。若欲使人不成病者，初觉即灸所觉处三二十壮，因此即愈，不复发也。黄帝云：当风取凉，醉已入房，能成此疾。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>　　　　　论冷热不同</p>
<p>　　问曰：何故得者有冷有热？答曰：足有三阴三阳，寒中三阳，所患必冷，暑中三阴，所患必热，故有表里冷热不同。热者治以冷药，冷者疗以热药，以意消息之。脾受阳毒即热顽，肾受阴湿即寒痹。<br>　　　　　论因脚气续生诸病</p>
<p>　　虽患脚气，不妨乳石动发，皆须服压石药疗之。夫因患脚气续生诸病者，则以诸药对之。或小便不利，则以猪苓、茯苓及诸利小便药治之；大便极坚者，则以五柔麻仁丸等治之；遍体肿满成水病者，则取治水方中诸治水之药治之。余皆仿此，更无拘忌。<br>　　　　　论须疗缓急</p>
<p>　　凡小觉病候有异，即须大怖畏，决意急治之，勿缓。气上入腹，或肿或不肿，胸胁逆满，气上肩息，急者死不　　旋踵，宽者数日必死，不可不急也。但看心下急，气喘不停，或自汗数出，或乍寒乍热，其脉促短而数，呕吐不止者皆死。<a id="orig-58p" href="#trans-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>　　　　　论虚实可服药不可服药</p>
<p>　　凡脚气之疾，皆由气实而死，终无一人以服药致虚而殂。故脚气之人，皆不得大补，亦不可大泻，终不得畏虚，故预止汤不服也。如此者，皆死不治也。<br>　　　　　论看病问疾人</p>
<p>　　世间大有病人亲朋故旧交游来问疾，其人曾不经一事，未读一方，自骋了了，诈作明能，谈说异端，或言是虚，或言是实，或云是风，或云是蛊，或道是水，或石是痰，纷纭谬说，种种不同。破坏病人心意，不知孰是，迁延未定，时不待人，欻然致祸，各自散走。是故大须好人及好名医，识病深浅，探赜方书，博览古今，是事明解者看病，不尔大悞人事。窃悲其如此者众，故一一显析，具述病之由状，令后来病者读之，以自防备也。但有一状相应，则须依方急治，勿取外人言议，自贻忧悔，但详方意，愈人不难，莫信他言以自误也。余尝为人撰门冬煎，此方治脚气大有验，病者须急用之。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>　　　　　论脉候法</p>
<p>　　凡脚气虽复诊候多涂，而三部之脉，要须不违四时者为吉，其逆四时者勿治。余如《脉经》所说，此中不复具载。其人本黑瘦者易治，肥大肉厚赤白者难愈。黑人耐风湿，赤白不耐风，瘦人肉硬，肥人肉软，肉软则受疾至深，难愈也。<br>　　　　　论肿不肿</p>
<p>　　凡人久患脚气不自知别，于后因有他疾发动，治之得瘥，后直患呕吐而复脚弱，余为诊之，乃告为脚气。病者曰：某平生不患脚肿，何因名为脚气？不肯服汤。余医以为石发。狐疑之间，不过一旬而死。故脚气不得一向以肿为候，亦有肿者，有不肿者。其以小腹顽痹不仁者，脚多不肿。小腹顽痹，不过三五日，即令人呕吐者，名脚气入心。如此者，死在旦夕。凡患脚气到心，难治，以其肾水克心火故也。<a id="orig-60p" href="#trans-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>　　　　　论须慎不慎</p>
<p>　　凡脚气之病，极须慎房室、羊肉、牛肉、鱼、蒜、蕺菜、菘菜、蔓青、瓠子、酒、面、酥油、乳麋、猪、鸡、鹅、鸭，有方用鲤鱼头，此等并切禁，不得犯之，并忌大怒。惟得食粳粱、粟米、酱豉、葱、韭、薤、椒、姜、橘皮。又不得食诸生果子酸酢之食，犯者皆不可瘥。又大宜生牛乳，生栗子。<br>　　　　　论善能治者几日可瘥</p>
<p>　　凡脚气病枉死者众，略而言之有三种：一觉之伤晚，二骄狠恣傲，三狐疑不决。此三种，正当枉死之也。故世间诚无良医，虽有良医，而病人有性灵，堪受入者，更复鮮少。故虽有骐骥而不遇伯乐，虽有尼父而人莫之师，其为枉横，亦犹此也。今有病者，有受入性依法，使余治之，不过十日，可得永瘥矣。若无受入性者，亦不须为治。纵能治之，恐无瘥日也。非似脚气，诸病皆然。良药善言，触目可致，不可使人必服。法为信者施，不为疑者说。<a id="orig-61p" href="#trans-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>　　　　　论服汤药色目</p>
<p>　　风毒之气，入人体中，脉有三品，内外证候相似，但脉有灾耳。若脉浮大而缓，宜服续命汤两剂，应瘥。若风盛，宜作越婢汤，加白朮四两。若脉浮大紧转快，宜作竹沥汤。若病人脉微而弱，宜服风引汤。此人脉，多是因虚而得之。若大虚短气力乏，可其间作补汤，随病冷热而用之。若未愈，更服竹沥汤。若病人脉浮大而紧快，此是三品之中，最恶脉也。或沉细而快者，此脉正与浮大而紧者，同是恶脉。浮大者病在外，沉细者病在内，治亦不异，当消息以意耳。其形尚可，而手足未容至弱，数日之中，气上即便命终。<a id="orig-62p" href="#trans-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>如此之脉，往往有人得之，无一存者，急服竹沥汤，日服一剂，切要汤势常令相及，勿令半日之中，空无汤也。此汤竹沥多，服之若不极热，辄停在胸心，更为人患。每服当使极热，若服竹沥汤得下者，必佳也。若已服三剂竹沥汤，病及脉势未折，而苦胀满，可以大鳖甲汤下之。汤势尽而不得下，可以丸药助汤令下。后更服竹沥汤，趣令脉势折，气息料理便停，服三十二物八风散佳。又初得病，便摩野葛膏，日再，顽痹脚弱都愈乃止。若服竹沥汤，脉势折如未病时，气力转胜，脚故未能行，体力充足，然后渐微行步。病重者瘥后半年，始能人扶行耳。<a id="orig-63p" href="#trans-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>既觉脉及体内瘥，但当勤服八风散，勿以脚未能行，轻加余治，余治未必全得益，更生诸恶，失此诸治也。猥人边亦勿行野葛膏。有人闻竹沥汤云恐伤腰脚者，即与勿治。宜知此法，此皆人无受入性，不可与医故也。不为疑者说，此之谓也。竹沥汤有三首，轻者服前方，重者以次第服后方。此风毒乃相注易，病人宜将空缺服小金牙散，以少许涂鼻孔耳门，病困人及新亡人、喜易人、强健人宜将服之，亦以涂耳鼻乃可。临近亡人及视疾者，绛囊带一方寸匕，男左女右臂此散毒。服宜从少为始。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>病人惟宜饮赤小豆饮，冬服侧子金牙酒、续命汤。治风毒病，初得似时行毒病，而脉浮缓终不变，快者不治，或数日而死，或十日而死。或得便不识人，或发黄，或发斑，或目赤，或下部穿烂者，此最急，得之即先服续命汤一剂，并服葛根汤、麻黄汤下之。若此不折，更与续命汤两三剂必瘥。此病大急，常令汤势相接，不可使半日缺汤，不然，即便杀人。夫脚气之病，先起岭南，稍来江东亦有得之者。其证或微觉疼痹，或两胫肿满，或行起濇弱，或上入腹不仁，或时冷热，小便秘濇，喘息，气上冲咽喉，气急欲死，食呕不下，气上逆者，皆其候也。若觉此证，先与犀角旋覆花汤。<a id="orig-65p" href="#trans-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>　　　　活人书 【宋　朱肱】</p>
<p>　　　　　脚气</p>
<p>　　伤寒只传足经，不传手经。地之寒暑风湿，皆作蒸气，足常履之，遂成脚气，所以病证与伤寒相近。其脉浮而弦者起于风，濡而弱者起于湿，洪而数者起于热，迟而濇者起于寒。风者汗而愈，湿者温而愈，热者下而愈，寒者熨而愈。脚气之病，始得不觉，因他病乃知。毒气入心，则小腹顽痹不仁，令人呕吐，死在朝夕矣。然终是与伤寒不同者，孙真人云：卒起脚屈弱不能转动，有此为异耳。要之，有脚气之人，先从脚起，或先缓弱疼痹，寒气胜者为痛痹，有寒故痛也；或行起忽倒，或两胫肿痛，亦有不肿者；或脚膝枯细，或心中忪悸，或小腹不仁。盖病久入深，荣卫之行濇，皮肤不荣，故为不仁。不仁者，皮顽不知有无也。<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>或举体转筋，或见食呕逆，恶闻食气，或胸满气急，或遍体酸痛，皆脚气候也。黄帝所谓缓风湿痹是也。顽弱名缓风，疼痛为湿痹。痹者，闭也，闭而不仁，故曰痹也。寒中三阳，所患必冷，越婢汤、小续命汤主之。小续命煎汤成，旋入生姜自然汁，最快。暑中三阴，所患必热，小续命汤去附子，减桂一半。大烦躁者，紫雪最良。大便秘者，脾约丸、神功丸、五柔丸、大三脘散、木瓜散主之。脚气之疾，皆由气实，而始终无一人以服药致虚而殂者。头痛身热，肢节痛而脚屈弱者，是其人素有脚气，此时发动也。脚肿者，槟榔散主之。脚气方论，《千金》、《外台》最详，此不复叙。大抵越婢汤、小续命汤、薏苡仁酒法、脾约丸、神功丸皆要药也。仍针灸为佳。服补药与用汤淋洗者，皆医之大禁也。<a id="orig-67p" href="#trans-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>　　　　济生方 【宋　严用和】</p>
<p>　　　　　脚气</p>
<p>　　《千金》言脚气皆由感风毒所致。又经云：地之寒暑风湿，皆作蒸气，足常履之，遂成脚气。然古来无脚气之说，黄帝时名为厥，两汉之间名曰缓风，宋齐之后谓之脚气，其名虽不同，其实一也。以此观之，寒暑风湿皆能致此，非特风毒而已。脚气之病，初得不觉，因他病乃始发动，或奄然大闷，经三两日方乃觉之。先从脚起，或缓弱疼痹，或行起忽倒，或两胫肿满，或足膝枯细，或心中忪悸，或小腹不仁，或举体转筋，或见食吐逆，恶闻食气，或胸满气急，或遍体酸痛，此其候之不同也。大抵寒中三阳，所患必冷；暑中三阴，所患必热。诚哉斯言。<a id="orig-68p" href="#trans-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>若论其脉，浮而弦者起于风，濡而弱者起于湿，洪而数者起于热，迟而濇者起于寒。风者汗而愈，湿者温而愈，热者下而愈，寒者熨而愈。凡得脚气，速宜针灸之。惟用汤淋洗者，医之大禁也。观夫脚气皆由肾虚而生，然妇人亦有病脚气者，必因血海虚乘宿块，嗔恚哀感悲伤，遂成斯疾。兼今妇人病此者众，则知妇人以血海虚而得之，与男子肾虚类矣。治妇人之法，与男子用药固无异，但兼以治忧恚药，无不效也。且补泻之法，当顺四时。春秋二时，当急补泻；夏月疾盛，专须汗利；入冬已后，须量人之盛衰，微加滋补。不然，则气血日衰，必使年年遇蒸热而作，理之必然也。治法大概无越于斯。又当于四时之中，谨加调摄，不得久坐久立冷湿之地，暑月亦不当露坐湿处，能慎于斯，依法随证治之，无不瘥矣。<br>　　　　疮疡全书 【金　窦汉卿】<a id="orig-69p" href="#trans-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p>

<p>　　脚气类伤寒，则察之难；脚气能令人死，则治之难。一病而有二难，是非可以浅浅论脚气矣。考方七首，同志者尚教我哉！　　脚气憎寒壮热者，防己饮主之。盖脚气者，湿热在足而作气痛也。湿热分争，湿胜则令人憎寒，热胜则令人憎寒，热胜则令人壮热，此其为证。亦有兼头疼者，颇类伤寒，惟其得病之始，本于脚气为异耳。又不可以脚肿为拘，亦有痛而不肿者名曰干脚气，亦有缓纵不随者名曰缓风，亦有疼痛不仁者名曰湿痹，亦有转筋挛急者名曰风毒，此在医者体会而辨证尔。各有治法不同。大抵脚气之疾，壅疾也，喜通而恶塞。故孙真人曰：脚气之疾，皆由气实而死，终无一人以服药致虚而殂。故脚气之人，皆不得大补，亦不得大泻。是方也，木通、防己、槟榔，通剂也，可以去塞。犀角、黄蘗、生地黄、甘草梢，寒剂也，可以去热。苍、白二朮，燥剂也，可以去湿。<a id="orig-166p" href="#trans-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>然川芎能散血中之气，犀角能利气中之血。先痛而后肿者，气伤血也，重用川芎；先肿而后痛者，血伤气也，重用犀角。若大便实者加桃仁，小便濇者加牛膝，内热加芩连，时热加石膏，有痰加竹沥。全在活法，初勿拘也。凡脚气冲心，喘息不止，呕吐不休者，皆死，水犯火故也。　　脚气痛肿，寒热相搏，脉来沉细者，越婢汤主之。盖气不得通则痛，血不得行则肿，此脚气之所以为壅疾也。寒热相搏者，邪气与正气相激搏也。脉来沉者为里，细者为阴。名曰越婢者，越以发越为义；婢，卑也。是方能发越至卑之气，故以越婢名之。石膏性寒而重，寒能胜热，重能就下。附子味辛而热，辛能行壅，热能壮气。佐之以麻黄，则寒热之壅滞，皆从汗孔而泄矣。用白朮、甘草，取其气味温平，能致冲和之气于发越之余耳。而甘草独少者，恐其性缓，多则不能速达于卑下之区也。　　寒湿脚气，疼痛不仁，两尺脉来沉细者，六物附子汤主之，此痹证也。<a id="orig-167p" href="#trans-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>《内经》曰：寒气胜者为痛痹，湿气胜者为着痹。今疼痛不仁，是寒而且着也。两尺主两足，脉来沉者为里，迟者为寒。是方也，用桂心、附子温其寒，防己、白朮制其湿。甘草、茯苓脾家药也，扶土气之不足，制湿气之有余。然必冷服者，欲桂、附之性行于下而不欲其横于上也。　　干脚气者谓脚气入腹，不得通泄也。脚气干于肝，则左胁有块；脚气干于脾，则令人痞。脚气干于心，则令人死于夜，以夜气助其阴邪也。因大寒不知人者，阴进而阳不舒也，以杉木汤主之。盖杉木节质重而气芳，质重则能达下，气芳则能疏壅。橘叶味苦而厚，过于青皮；槟榔质实而重，等于铁石。味厚则泄，质重则降，故能令邪气大下。童便，咸寒物也，咸则能引邪气以走浊阴，寒则能平热气使不上逆。经曰：道之远者制大其服。故其量数五升云。　　凡人患寒湿脚气，疼痛不仁者，内服煎剂，外宜以椒汤洗之。<a id="orig-168p" href="#trans-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>盖川椒能疗寒湿之痹，姜葱辛温，能利肌肤之气。又曰：诸脚气者，皆壅疾也，洗之无有不良。　　脚气疼肿，湿热发黄者，当归拈痛汤主之。盖脚气内壅，故令疼肿，湿热不得泄越，故令发黄。是方也，羌活、防风、升麻、葛根、苍朮皆辛散之剂也，可以泄越壅塞之脚气。苦参、黄芩、茵陈、知母皆苦寒之品也，可以解除内壅之湿热。泽泻、猪苓、白朮乃淡渗物耳，能导利下焦之湿。<a id="orig-169p" href="#trans-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>当归、人参、甘草者所以养血于败坏之余，益气于泄越之后也。　　脾气虚弱，胃气下注，令人足跗气肿者，升阳顺气汤主之。盖脾虽具坤静之德，而有干健之运，故脾气冲和，则升清降浊，无跗肿也。脾气一虚，土不制水，则胃中水谷之气，随经而下注，令人跗肿。是方也，半夏、甘草所以益脾，人参、黄芪所以益气，神曲、豆蔻所以消磨水谷，升麻、柴胡所以升举胃气，当归能使诸药归脾，陈皮能利中宫之气。而蘗皮者，取其味厚，引升麻、柴胡下走足跗，而升举其陷下之阳尔。<a id="orig-170p" href="#trans-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>　　　　医门法律 【清　喻昌】</p>
<p>　　　　　论增损八味丸治脚气</p>
<p>　　古方崔氏八味丸，用附桂二味阳药，入地黄等六味阴药之中，《金匮》取治脚气上入少腹不仁，其意颇微。盖地气上加于天，则独用姜、附之猛以胜之。地气才入少腹，适在至阴之界，无事张皇，所以但用阳药加于阴药内治之，不必偏于阳也。至肾水泛溢，妇人转胞，小便不利，则变其名为肾气丸，而药仍不变。盖收摄肾气，则肾水归源，而小便自行，亦无取偏阳为矣。观此则治阳虚阴盛之卒病，其当用纯阳无阴，更复何疑。<a id="orig-171p" href="#trans-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>后人于脚气入腹，少腹不仁，而见上气喘急，呕吐自汗，不识其证地气已加于天，袭用此方不应，乃云此证最急，以肾乘心，水克火，死不旋踵。用本方加附、桂各一倍，终是五十步笑百步，不达卒病大关，徒以肾乘心，水克火，五脏受克为最急，不知五脏互相克贼，危则危矣，急未急也。厥后朱奉议治脚气变八味丸为八味汤，用附子、干姜、芍药、茯苓、甘草、桂心、人参、白朮，其义颇精，于中芍药、甘草、人参临证更加裁酌，则益精矣。奈何无识之辈，复以此汤插入己见，去桂心，加干地黄，以阴易阳，奚啻千里？而方书一概混收，讵识其为奉议之罪人乎？<a id="orig-172p" href="#trans-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>　　　　　四肢不举</p>
<p>　　中风四肢不举，有虚有实。阳明虚则宗筋失润，不能束骨而利机关，阳明实则肉理致密，加以风邪内淫，正气故不周流也。虚用六君子汤，实用三化汤合承气汤。　　凡治中风四肢不举，证不辨虚实，妄行补泻者，医之过也。四肢不举，皆属脾土。膏粱太过，积热内壅者，为脾上瘀实，宜泻以开其壅；食少体羸，怠惰嗜卧者，为脾土虚衰，宜补以健其运。若不辨而实者补之，虚者泻之，宁不伤人乎？<br>　　　　　脚膝痿弱</p>
<p>　　又有脚膝痿弱，下部尻臀皆冷，阴汗臊臭，精滑不固，脉沉数有力，为火郁于内，逼阴向外，即阳盛拒阴，当用苦寒药下之者，此水火征兆之微，脉证治例之妙，当取之为法。<a id="orig-173p" href="#trans-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>　　　　　鹤膝风</p>
<p>　　鹤膝风者，即风寒湿之痹于膝者也。如膝骨日大，上下肌肉日枯细者，且未可治其膝，先养血气，俾肌肉渐荣，后治其膝可也。此与治左右半身偏枯之证大同。夫既偏枯矣，急溉其未枯者，然后既枯者得以通气而复荣。倘不知从气引血，从血引气之法，但用麻黄、防风等散风之套药，鲜有不全枯而遂死者。故治鹤膝风而亟攻其痹，必并其足痿而不用矣。比而论之，其治法不益明乎？　　古方治小儿鹤膝风，用六味地黄丸加鹿茸、牛膝，共八味，不治其风，其意最善。盖小儿非必为风寒湿所痹，多因先天所禀，肾气衰薄，阴寒凝聚于腰膝而不解，从外可知其内也。故以六味丸补肾中之水，以鹿茸补肾中之火，以牛膝引至骨节而壮其裹撷之筋，此治本不治标之良法也，举此为例而推之。<a id="orig-174p" href="#trans-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>
<p>　　　　　脚气论证</p>
<p>　　脚气之说，古所无也，自晋　苏敬始有此名。然其肿痛麻顽，即经之所谓痹也；其纵缓不收，即经之所谓痿也；其甚而上冲，即经之所谓厥逆也。逮夫后世，则有类伤寒四证，而以脚气居其一，谓凡头痛发热，身痛便闭，而但见脚膝屈弱无力者，便是脚气。此说太混，予不然之。夫脚气本水湿下壅之病，而实非阳邪外感证也。若诸证之兼见者，则或有之。若以外感之脚软者，便认作脚气，则淆乱意见，大不通也。兹予删诸繁琐，述其节要，法既无遗，庶便理会。　　夫脚气之证，其初甚微，饮食动作，无不如故，或无他疾而忽得之，或因病后而渐得之。及其病也，则自膝至足，或见麻痹，或见冷痛，或见痿弱，或见挛急，或肿或不肿，或日渐枯细，或蒸蒸发热，或洒洒恶寒，或如水冷，或如火热，或到底能食，或不能食，或有物如指，发自踹腓，而气上冲心，是皆脚气之正病也。<a id="orig-175p" href="#trans-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>共有为发热头痛，寒热往来，或腹内作痛，或见饮食则呕吐，或恶闻食气，或不欲见明，或语言错乱，精神昏愦，是皆脚气之兼证也。大抵此证有缓急，缓者其来渐，或二三月而日甚，急者其来速，或一二日而即起，治之若缓，恐其气上冲心，亦能杀人。　　脚气之因有二：一则自外而感，一则自内而致也。自外而感者，以阴寒水雨湿雾之气，或坐卧湿地，致令湿邪袭人皮肉筋脉。而凡清湿袭虚，则病始于下，致为腿足之病，此外因也。自内而致者，以肥甘过度，酒醴无节，或多食乳酪湿热等物，致令热壅下焦，走注足胫，而日渐肿痛，或上连手节者，此内因也。然在古人，谓南方卑湿，病多外因，北方嗜洒酪，病多内因，此固一说。然北方亦有寒湿，南方岂少酒湿？此固不必分南北。其或内或外，凡受邪气，有病始于足而渐致他证者，即脚气之谓也，必察其因而治之，则自无失矣。<a id="orig-176p" href="#trans-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>
<p>　　脚气之病，实三气之所为也，然亦有虚实之异。又脚气本为壅疾，古人忌用补剂，然必下元不足，及阳明之气有亏者，而后邪气得以犯之，此其中亦有虚证。总之，凡治此者，只因证施治则万全也。但察其因于表者，以发散为主；因于里者，以疏利为主。外因者多寒湿，宜用温热；内因者多湿热，宜用清凉。若元气本虚，及病久致虚者，必当培补下元，不得以忌补之说为拘也。<a id="orig-177p" href="#trans-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>　　脚气初起，无非湿滞，如无他证兼见，而身体重著者，单宜治湿，以分利为主。　　凡脚膝中湿，或腰腿酸疼，重着肿痛者，宜除湿汤，不问久近、干湿并可用。若脚膝酸软重着，而胃气不清，或见噫气吞酸胀满者，平胃散。若脚气浮肿而兼泄泻者，宜五苓散或胃苓汤。　　寒湿外侵，致成脚气者，十居六七，其证疼痛拘挛，恶寒清厥，脉多弦细，治宜以温经除湿为主。是以古人治此之法，大抵热药多，寒药少，故每用麻黄、川乌、桂、附、干姜之属。《内经》曰：湿淫于内，治以苦热。正以乌、附、麻黄，走而不守，故能通行经络。<a id="orig-178p" href="#trans-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>官桂、干姜，辛甘大热，故能助阳退阴。清湿既除，病无不愈。　　凡感寒湿雨水，或四气流注，致成脚气，肿痛不可忍者，宜鸡鸣散如神。若寒湿内侵，阳虚阴盛，胃气不强，经气不行，顽水浮肿，或疼痛不已者，独活汤。若寒邪入腹，喘急疼痛，或筋急上冲，闷乱危急欲绝者，茱萸丸，或茱萸木瓜汤。若寒湿在经，血脉不和，腰脚筋骨酸软无力，或拘挛疼痛，脉弱而濇者，酒浸牛膝丸。若寒湿壅肿，气滞不行，或冷或痛者，立效散。<a id="orig-179p" href="#trans-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>若寒湿兼风者，如五积散，小续命汤皆宜用，详具后条。　　一湿热内蒸，致成脚气者，多因酒食不节，其证必烦热多渴，脉见滑数，二便或多不利，治宜利湿清火为主。若湿热下壅，足胫肿痛不消者，防己饮加减治之；或苍朮黄蘗丸，或二妙散，或加味二妙丸俱妙。若湿热气壅，上冲胸腹，烦渴闷乱，头疼口干者，活人犀角散。若湿热流注经络，肢节烦痛，肩背沉重，手足遍身疼痛热肿者，当归拈痛丸。若感冒暑湿，肢节疼痛，身热口渴，小便赤濇，气虚气促者，清暑益气汤。若肝肾阴虚血热，脚膝疼痛，行止艰难，小水不利者，续断丸。<a id="orig-180p" href="#trans-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>　　脚气有壅滞气逆者，其证必喘满气急，上攻心腹，甚至危急可畏，治宜行滞降气为主。　　凡脚气上冲心腹，喘急不得眠卧者，紫苏散、槟榔汤，或加减槟榔汤，甚者四磨饮。若脚气喘急，腹满脚肿者，桑白皮散，或木通散。若脚气脐下气升，冲心烦闷者，木香散或槟榔散。若脚气心胸壅闷，呕逆多痰不食者，半夏散或紫苏汤。若浮肿，心腹痞闷，小水不利，大腹皮散。　　凡风湿合邪而为脚气者，其证必兼外感，而或为寒热往来，或为喘咳气急，或流走无常，或筋骨疼痛，治宜以散风除湿，通行经络为主。<a id="orig-181p" href="#trans-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>若感四时风疫风湿，或处阴湿之地，致为脚气痿弱，筋骨疼痛，或寒热往来者，败毒散。若寒热如疟，赤肿疼痛者，加味败毒散。若脚气以风寒湿邪，客于经络，而骨髓酸痛不可忍，或遍身疼痛，恶寒呕逆者，五积散。一法加全蝎三个，入酒煎服。若脚气以风湿留滞，而阴寒外闭，表邪不解，或咳嗽喘满寒热者，小青龙汤。若风湿留滞，肢节烦疼，心神壅闷者，大腹子散。　　《千金》云：若脚气脉大而缓，宜服小续命汤二剂，立瘥。　　《活人》云：脚气属冷者，以小续命汤煎成，入生姜自然汁服之，最快。<a id="orig-182p" href="#trans-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br>若脚气风湿胜而兼发热咳嗽，肢体疼痛者，芎芷香苏散。若脚气风湿流注，憎寒发热，无汗恶寒者，麻黄左经汤。　　脚气有虚证者，凡脾胃肝肾之脉，皆出于足，邪之易入，多有乘虚，故肝虚则筋病，肾虚则骨病，脾虚则肌肉病，胃虚则宗筋病。或以劳欲不节，或以酒湿太过，或以病后失调，凡内有亏损而外有脚气者，无非虚证，此当以调补为主而兼察四气以治之。若肝肾阴虚，感触四气，而瘫痪顽木，半身不遂，脚膝无力，遍体疼痛者，神应养真丹，或三因四斤丸，或虎骨酒，或八味地黄丸。<a id="orig-183p" href="#trans-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>若脾胃大虚，阴寒在下，阳气不行，而病脚气者，独活汤、附子八味汤。若精血不足，阴虚于下，气不归精，而脚气上逆冲心者，地黄汤。若脾胃虚寒，兼风湿外邪而成脚气者，风引独活汤，或追毒汤。若以脾肾虚寒而兼咳嗽气逆呕吐者，兼补厚朴汤。　　脚气有实邪，凡壅盛肿痛而或为闭结，或为胀满者，治宜以疏导通利为主。若风湿壅盛，脚气肿痛，便结腹满者，羌活导滞汤，或枳实大黄汤。若四气流注，阳明风热，腰脚肿痛，大小便秘，喘满腹痛者，大黄左经汤。若脚气饮食不消，心下痞闷，腿脚肿痛者，开结导饮丸。<br>　　　　　敷熨淋洗</p>

<p>　　观《活人》等书云：凡脚气服补药，及用汤淋洗者，皆医之所禁也。此亦一偏之说耳。盖补有宜禁者，以邪壅气实者也。淋洗有宜禁者，以水湿汤气之宜避者也。如果下部虚寒，或以病后，或以克伐太过，而脚气不愈者，岂尚堪禁补乎？又若寒邪湿热，壅结不散，而为肿为痛者，最宜以辛香疏散之药煎汤蒸洗，则退邪极速，岂禁洗乎？惟是湿热气逆而上冲心腹者，不可骤洗，恐助湿气上升也。此必先降其气，俟其毒止在脚，再行熏洗，自无不利。盖补以补其弱也，洗以逐其滞也。夫何禁之有？<br>　　　　　论古</p>
<p>　　杨大受曰：脚气是壅疾，当用宣通之剂，使气不能成壅也。如羌活导滞汤之类所通用，又如苍、白朮、防己、南星以去湿，羌活、独活、木瓜、槟榔行气利关节以去壅，佐木通、牛膝以引经，当归、生地黄以和血，此必用之药也。又如东垣拈痛之类亦甚捷，余闪证之虚实寒热而辨治之，此即通变活法也。<a id="orig-185p" href="#trans-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br>　　　　　鹤膝风</p>

<p>　　有人指缝流血不止，有虫如蜉蝣之小，钻出少顷即能飞去，此证乃湿热生虫也。然何故生虫而能飞耶？盖不止湿热，而又带风邪也。凡虫感风者，俱有羽翼能飞，安在人身得风之气转不能飞也？方用白朮、茯苓、当归、白芍、生甘草各三钱，人参、柴胡、川芎、荆芥各一钱，熟地、黄芪、薏仁各五钱，水煎服。此方之妙，全不去杀虫，而但补其气血，而佐之去湿去风。人身气血和，自不生虫，补气血之和，则虫自无藏身之窟。况又逐水消风，虫更从何处生活耶？此方之所以平而奇也。服四剂则血不流而虫不出，再服四剂，手指完好如初矣。<a id="orig-193p" href="#trans-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br>　　　　　掌中突高</p>

<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Clear Yang fills the four limbs, while turbid Yin returns to the six organs.<br><em>[Note: The four limbs serve as the support of all Yang, whereas the six organs transform and process substances without storing. This indicates that the clear Yang generated from food nourishes the four limbs, while the turbid substances return to the six organs. The spleen governs the four limbs and is said to uniquely receive the turbid. The clear within the turbid is transformed and transported by the spleen, nourishing the four limbs, while the turbid within the turbid returns to the six organs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Distinction of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The three Yang are in the head, the three Yin are in the hands, which is called unity.<br><em>[Note: The pulses of the three Yang flow from the hands to the head and from the head to the feet, hence the three Yang are in the head. The pulses of the three Yin flow from the feet to the abdomen and from the abdomen to the hands, hence the three Yin are in the hands. Although the twelve meridians are differentiated into hand and foot Yin and Yang, they are all interconnected as one.]</em> </p>
<p>When the three Yang and three Yin manifest illness, there is debilitation, paralysis, and inability to lift the limbs.<br><em>[Note: The three Yang and three Yin refer to diseases related to the Sun and Taiyin. Debilitation refers to hemiplegia. Paralysis refers to an inability to move as usual. The Yang of the Sun is the master of all Yang qi and governs the tendons. If Yang qi is deficient, there is debilitation; if Yang is deficient and cannot nourish the tendons, there is paralysis. The spleen is associated with the four limbs, thus there is inability to lift them. This relates to the water organ causing disease and reverse acting upon the spleen&#39;s earth.]</em> </p>
<p>The manifestation of excessive Yang results in swelling of the limbs.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

[Note: The spleen governs the muscles, and when spleen qi is damaged, the body feels heavy, and the muscles are prone to atrophy. The foot taiyin channel runs along the lower leg and knee; when there is evil in the channel, the feet cannot retract. When qi is damaged, this leads to pain.]</p>
<p>Those with lung diseases experience wheezing, coughing, reverse flow of qi, shoulder and back pain, sweating, and pain in the buttocks, inner thighs, knees, legs, and feet.

<p><strong>Discussion on the Concepts of Xu (Deficiency) and Shi (Excess)</strong><br>The Yellow Emperor asked: What is meant by deficiency and excess? Qi Bo replied: When pathogenic qi is strong, it leads to excess; when vital essence is taken away, it leads to deficiency. The Emperor asked: How do we identify deficiency and excess? Qi Bo said: When the qi is deficient, it indicates lung deficiency; when qi is reversed, it indicates cold in the feet. At the wrong time, this leads to life, while at the right time, it leads to death. This applies to all organs. [Note: Pathogenic qi can be mildly strong, hence strong evil leads to excess; vital qi has strengths and weaknesses, so when essence is taken, it leads to deficiency. When evil enters from the surface into the interior, the external qi, blood, and flesh may initially be consumed by the evil illness, hence when the flesh is slippery and strong, the evil does not invade internally, and the interior remains solid. If the surface qi is deficient, it harms the five organs, leading to a void inside; this delineates the deficiency and excess of both surface and interior. When qi is reversed upward, the lower body is deficient and the feet become cold; this indicates the deficiency and excess of both upper and lower parts. When it occurs during the time of flourishing growth, it brings life; when it occurs at the time of overcoming, it brings death; this addresses the seasonal aspects of deficiency and excess.] The Emperor asked: What is meant by heavy deficiency? Qi Bo said: When the pulse is weak at the wrist and the qi is deficient, this is termed heavy deficiency.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

When the pulse at the wrist is empty, one walks unsteadily; when the pulse is weak, it does not resemble yin. In such cases, if it is slippery, it brings life; if it is dry, it leads to death.</p>

The lower deficiency refers to the emptiness of pulse &quot;qi&quot; below. When both upper and lower are empty, it is called &quot;heavy emptiness&quot;. &quot;Qi&quot; represents the protective and nourishing &quot;qi&quot; produced by the yangming, and when it is empty, it leads to a feeling of fear and weakness. If the &quot;qi&quot; of yangming is empty above, speech becomes inconsistent; if it is empty below, it makes one walk unsteadily. &quot;Qi&quot; flows from the taiyin to influence the hand of yangming, ascending to the foot of yangming, and descending to the ankles. Therefore, it is said that above the waist, both the hands of taiyin and yangming are in charge; below the waist, both the feet of taiyin and yangming are in charge. &quot;Qi&quot; is yang, while blood vessels are yin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of life arises from the connection of the pulse at the fingertips, responding to the vital energy of Yangming, rather than reflecting the emptiness of its Yin. Qi is generated from Yangming, with its origin in the kidneys. The minimal Yin energy rises to join with Yangming; when Yin and Yang clash, the pulse becomes slippery. Such interaction allows the essence of food and drink to transform into Qi, thus sustaining life. Excessive dryness indicates a lack of vital energy; when the origin of life is severed, it results in death.</p>
<p>The Emperor inquired: &quot;What if the pulse is firm and full, with cold hands and feet and a hot head?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;Life prevails in spring and autumn, but death occurs in winter and summer. A floating pulse with dryness and a body that is warm indicates death.&quot; The Emperor asked: &quot;What if the body is completely full?&quot; Qibo responded: &quot;If the body is completely full, the pulse becomes rapid, large, and firm; the wrists are dry and unresponsive.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A hot head is the result of excess solar energy rising upwards. The kidneys and bladder, where yin and yang interact, govern the generation of vital energy; if this energy is abundant externally, it will become deficient internally. In spring, yang energy slightly rises while yin energy slightly descends; in autumn, yin energy slightly rises while yang energy slightly descends. The two energies of yin and yang nourish each other, which sustains life. In winter, yin energy is completely externalized, and in summer, yang energy is fully deficient internally, leading to death. This indicates that the root energy of yin and yang should not be depleted. If the pulse is superficial and weak, it means that yin is excessive externally while being deficient internally. A weak pulse coupled with body heat indicates that yang has been depleted internally and is relaxed externally. The depletion of the root energy of yin and yang indicates signs of death; it is not only winter and summer that lead to death, but spring and autumn can also sustain life. Furthermore, if the body is swollen from water retention, with tight skin and a strong pulse, if the hands and feet feel warm, it is called supportive and life-giving; if they feel cold, it is termed adversarial and leads to death. Warmth recovers the vital energy of the lesser yin, while the forces of fire and earth gradually strengthen, and the cold influences of water dissipate. Cold signifies that the vital energy of the lesser yin has been completely exhausted, thus resulting in death.

<p><strong>From the Taiyin Yangming Treatise:</strong></p>
<p>The yin energy travels from the feet to the head and then travels down the arms to the fingertips; the yang energy travels from the hands to the head and then descends to the feet. Thus it is said: for yang illnesses, there is an ascent to the extreme and a descent; for yin illnesses, there is a descent to the extreme and an ascent. Therefore, those affected by wind will initially suffer from the upper body; those affected by dampness will initially suffer from the lower body. <strong>[Note: The term &quot;earth&quot; refers to the generation of all things and the laws of heaven and earth. The heavenly qi descends while the earthly qi ascends, thus affecting all four directions and everywhere in between. The spiritual essence, qi, and blood of the organs and the yin and yang of the twelve meridians are all generated from the earth. The yin concentrates on the yin, and the yang focuses on the yang, meaning that the pathogens follow the movement of qi. The entry and exit of a person’s yin and yang depend on the rise and fall of qi. This is why yang illnesses located above will, over time, follow the descent of qi; yin illnesses located below will, over time, follow the ascent of qi. For those who are first affected above, it indicates the pernicious qi is within a person of higher status, hence the pathogen is found above. For those who are first affected below, it indicates the clear and damp earthly qi is within a person who must begin with the feet, hence the clear qi is found below.]</strong> The Emperor asked: Why do the limbs become unusable in spleen diseases? Qi Bo answered: The limbs all receive qi from the stomach; if they do not reach the meridians, it must be due to the spleen, thus hindering their ability to receive it.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

The kidneys govern the storage of essence, which Yangming produces. The essence of the kidneys ascends and combines with Yangming, and when Wuxing and Guoqi unite, it transforms into fire. The upward flow of this fire qi, paired with deficient Yin qi, leads to predominance of Yang. However, alone, Yang cannot generate; it cannot further produce Yang heat, and thus it only triumphs.

Thus, the external evil does not affect the internal yin, and only the yang becomes active. Heat injures the qi, hence the shortness of breath. The heart dislikes heat, resulting in irritability. The hands and feet are the foundations of all yang; therefore, they are hot. The classic states that all sour vomiting belongs to heat. This is the warm malaria that does not recur with cold, called &quot;dan malaria.&quot; &quot;Dan&quot; refers to singularity, indicating that it is primarily a disease of heat generated by excessive yang.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p>In late summer, if the earth is harmed by bad influences, it is called spleen wind. The symptoms of spleen wind include excessive sweating, aversion to wind, lethargy in the body, unwillingness to move the limbs, a pale yellow complexion, lack of appetite, and diagnosis often shows yellow in the nose. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The spleen governs the muscles and limbs, leading to lethargy and unwillingness to move, which indicates spleen qi illness. The foot Taiyin channel belongs to the spleen and connects to the stomach, traversing the diaphragm and linking the throat to the base of the tongue. The meridian section states: sickness produced by the spleen is characterized by inability to digest food. Located at the center, thus, diagnosis shows in the nose.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion on Reversal</strong></p>
<p>If there is reversal in the great yang, the head swells and feels heavy, and the feet cannot walk, resulting in fainting. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Great yang corresponds to the sun. The foot Taiyang channel begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses the forehead to the crown, connects to the brain, and travels down the neck along the spine to the waist, passing through the buttocks and entering the popliteal fossa, moving along the inner knee and exiting behind the outer ankle. Therefore, if the reversal is above, it leads to head swelling and head pain; if it is below, it results in an inability to walk, and if there is clouding of the spirit and qi, it causes fainting. The sun governs all yang energies, and this illness affects the channels and then transforms into an issue of qi. </p>
<p>Reversal in the lesser yang results in sudden deafness, facial swelling and heat, pain in the side, and the inability to move the legs.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>The condition of the foot Jueyin manifests as swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, abdominal distension, ineffective urination, a preference for lying with knees bent, swelling of the genitals, and internal heat in the joints. </p>
<p>The channel of the foot Jueyin penetrates into the lower abdomen, connecting to the liver and gallbladder via the stomach. The liver governs the tendons and the knee is the convergence of the tendons. If the channels are reversed, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, hence the preference for lying down with knees bent.</p>
<p>When all three Yin channels are reversed, it prevents movement back and forth, resulting in cold hands and feet, leading to death within three days. </p>
<p>The reversal of all three Yin channels signifies a distinction between Yin and Yang. The inability to move back and forth indicates that Yin concerns the lower part. All Yang energy arises from Yin; thus, if the three Yin channels are reversed, the vital energy is completely extinguished, causing coldness in the limbs and resulting in death within three days. This condition affects the Qi level, hence it is said to lead to death in three days, indicating the cessation of Three Yin Qi. If the reversal occurs in the channels, it results in a condition characterized by Jue, but does not lead to death.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a disease manifests as a limp due to deficiency, it results from the yang energy of the first month breaking through the frozen earth energy. The term &quot;deficiency&quot; refers to a significant lack during the cold of winter, which leads to the limp. [Note: This indicates that the yang energy arises from the cold water of winter, and when the cold water energy is insufficient, the yang energy is also deficient, resulting in a withered and limp foot.]</p>
<p>In the case of the lesser yang, when there are various difficulties, prolonged standing or sitting leads to a state where the eyes cannot see anything. The interplay of yin and yang becomes unstable, lacking a definitive control. As autumn begins to arrive with the first light frost, it begins to kill off all things. The internal struggle between yin and yang takes place, hence the inability of the eyes to see anything. [Note: &quot;Various difficulties&quot; refers to many things not being in harmony. This indicates that the lesser yang governs the periods of July and August, where, at the turn of July, the yin energy rises and the yang energy descends, causing instability between yin and yang elements, resulting in various difficulties and lack of clarity. As autumn arrives, the yang energy begins to descend, still weak internally, while the yin energy emerges, thus leading to an internal conflict between yin and yang, which causes the eyes to be unable to see anything.]<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>A Discourse on Composure</strong></p>
<p>The Thunder Lord said: There are people who are lethargic in their limbs, have coughs with blood, and experience leakage. Foolishly diagnosing them, they believe it is a lung injury, feeling the pulse as floating, large, and tight, but they do not dare to treat. Coarse practitioners, when using stone needles, often lead to greater blood loss; when the blood stops, the body feels light. What is this? The Emperor said: What I can treat is numerous, yet this illness is lost to me. An analogy can be made to the swan flying, soaring into the sky. The sage in treating illness follows laws and keeps to measures, using connections and comparisons. In transformation, there is the dark and the bright, following both above and below—must one necessarily adhere to the classics? </p>
<p>Now, a floating, large, and weak pulse indicates an absolute deficiency of spleen qi, departing from the stomach and returning to the Yangming. The two fires cannot overcome the three waters, thus the pulse is chaotic and irregular. Lethargy in the limbs signifies a deficiency in the movement of spleen essence. Coughing with breathlessness indicates that water qi combines with Yangming. Blood leakage reflects that the pulse is rapid and the blood has nowhere to circulate. If one thinks it is a lung injury, it stems from an errant understanding. Not drawing analogies and comparisons indicates a lack of clarity. </p>
<p>[Note: This refers to the essence-water of the kidneys, which penetrates the earth and connects to the heavens. The phrase “there are people here” refers to these kidneys, where the individual suffers symptoms like lethargy in the limbs.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The sage treats illness by following the principles of yin and yang, drawing comparisons from nature and illustrating with metaphors, such as a swan flying, which ascends to the sky, similar to how the essence of the kidneys connects to the spleen and stomach, aligning with the lungs above. Therefore, the sage observes the profound workings of creation, following the flow between water and heaven; why should one solely adhere to the classics? The outward deficiency of spleen qi does not circulate through the muscles and skin. The path returning from the stomach to the Yangming meridian involves departing from the middle stomach to reach the external Yangming channel. The two fires refer to the governing fire interacting with the water. The three waters denote the moisture engendered by the Taiyin, ultimately manifesting as rainfall, which represents the moisture of the earth. Above the sun, the cold water dominates, representing the celestial cold water. The kidneys are the water organ, embodying the essence of heavenly water. When the three waters become too abundant, fire cannot overcome them, resulting in chaotic pulses and irregularities. The heart governs the blood and envelops the pulse, and when water converges within the pulse, the governing yang cannot prevail, causing disorder in the pulse and erratic blood flow. If the limbs are sluggish, it points to the essence of the spleen and earth not circulating through the muscles and skin. Those with coughs and wheezing have the water vapor of the lower jiao converging on the Yangming channel. For blood leakage, the water vapor mingles within the pulse, thus the pulse becomes rapid and lacks direction, leading to erratic blood flow and discharge. If one assumes there is injury to the lungs based on misguided reasoning, it indicates a failure to grasp the principles of comparison. Without drawing comparisons, one cannot attain clear understanding. The connection of kidney essence to the lungs must ascend from the central earth; if it instead travels through the pulse, then the governing fire is harmed.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yin-Yang Classification</strong></p>
<p>Two Yins and one Yang cause illness in the kidneys, where Yin energy wanders under the heart, resulting in blocked and obstructed empty orifices, leading to the separation of the limbs. </p>
<p><em>Notes: This refers to water rising from the central earth to interact with the lungs, which then moves according to the weather in all directions. The two Yins refer to the two kidneys governed by the Lesser Yin, while the one Yang is the Lesser Yang generated by the kidney organs. The empty orifices denote the &quot;sweat cavities,&quot; overseen by the lungs; if water does not follow Qi to circulate on the surface of the skin, then the empty orifices become obstructed. The &quot;dam&quot; is what prevents water; if water does not penetrate into the soil&#39;s pathways, then the dam becomes blocked, causing the limbs to be unable to receive energy from the central earth. This is due to kidney disease and insufficient body fluids failing to nourish the spleen and lungs, leading to a deficiency of Qi that wanders under the heart following the Lesser Yang.</em></p>
<p>In the case of two Yins and two Yangs, illness affects the lungs; the pulse of the Lesser Yin is deep, overcoming lung weakness and affecting the limbs externally. </p>
<p><em>Notes: Here, the classifications of two Yins and two Yangs signify illness. The essence from the kidneys ascends to the lungs from the spleen, akin to a swan soaring into the sky. When the two Yins and two Yangs are similar but the illness affects the lungs, it signifies that kidney water directly ascends through the Yangming, thus causing the lung to become ill. The deep pulse of the Lesser Yin indicates that the heart and kidneys are not communicating. If water does not support fire, fire becomes hot and rises, overpowering the lungs; if water does not nourish the soil, the soil becomes dry, injuring the spleen&#39;s Qi, and external harm to the limbs occurs because the earth must receive water and moisture to irrigate in all directions.</em><a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Stomach Foot Yangming channel governs diseases arising from blood, such as mania, intermittent fever, sweating, nasal bleeding, mouth crookedness, swollen lips, swollen neck, throat obstruction, abdominal edema, knee pain, and pain along the breast, ribs, groin, popliteal fossa, outer calf, and the top of the foot. The middle finger may be unusable. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Pingmai&quot; chapter states: Water enters the channels, and then blood is formed. The stomach is the sea of food and grain, which occupies the role of generating this nourishing blood. Thus, it governs blood-related illnesses, including mania and intermittent fevers. When sweating occurs, it is due to the heat of stomach qi evaporating the fluids into sweat. Nasal bleeding is due to hot channel qi. Signs like crooked mouth, swollen lips, swollen neck, throat obstruction, abdominal swelling, knee pain, and pain in the channels of the breast, groin, popliteal fossa, and top of the foot indicate diseases of the Yangming channel.</p>
<p>The Spleen Foot Taiyin channel governs diseases arising from the spleen, leading to inability to lie down, forcing oneself to stand, internal swelling of the thigh and knee, and inability to use the big toe.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Inability to lie down, forcing oneself to stand, swelling of the thigh and knee, and inability to use the big toe suggest an external illness related to the spleen.</p>
<p>The Bladder Foot Taiyang channel leads to a condition where movement causes pain in the hip, hindering bending, a tight feeling in the knee, or a tearing sensation; these represent contracted pain. It governs diseases arising from tendons, resulting in pain in the neck, back, waist, buttocks, knees, and feet, and the little toe may be unusable.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yang energy is soft and nurtures the tendons, hence it is responsible for diseases arising in the tendons, including ailments related to the lower back, waist, and knees, all of which are associated with the pathways of the meridians. The heart governs the hand&#39;s jueyin (pericardium) meridian, which is the source of diseases related to the arteries, manifesting as heart distress, heart pain, and heat in the palms. </p>
<p>The heart governs blood and commands the pericardium, thus it is responsible for diseases originating from the pericardium meridian, resulting in heart distress, heart pain, and heat in the palms—all linked to the pathways of the meridians. The Sanjiao (Triple Burner) corresponds to the hand&#39;s shaoyang (lesser yang) meridian, which is linked to diseases arising from qi, presenting as sweating, sharp eye pain, swelling, and pain in the back of the ears, shoulders, and elbows, and leading to dysfunction in the little and ring fingers. </p>
<p>The shaoyang is characterized as an early manifestation of yang energy, which leads to diseases related to qi; thus, the sweating occurs when yang is intensified in the presence of yin. Symptoms such as sharp eye pain, cheek swelling, pain in the back of the ears, shoulders, elbows, and dysfunction in the little and ring fingers all correlate to the pathways of the meridians. The gallbladder corresponds to the foot&#39;s shaoyang meridian, attributing to diseases arising from the bones, resulting in pain in the chest, ribs, hips, knees, and various joints, particularly affecting the little and ring fingers.</p>
<p>The shaoyang pertains to the kidneys and thus governs diseases of the bones, leading to pain in the hips, knees, and ankles, which are manifestations in the foot&#39;s shaoyang meridian. Since shaoyang governs the bones, this results in widespread joint pain.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The month of Hai is October, which governs the left foot of the Jueyin. As these two Yin energies intersect completely, it is thus called Jueyin. </p>
<p>(Note: Ages above half a year are considered Yang, presiding over Shaoyang and Taiyang; ages below half a year are considered Yin, presiding over Shaoyin and Taiyin, resembling the division of the two principles into the four images. The two Yang energies unite and are thus called Yangming. The two Yin energies intersect completely, hence it is called Jueyin. These four images give rise to three Yin and three Yang in Tai, Shao, and Zhong. Males are born in Yin (Tiger), thus beginning with the Shaoyang of the first month; females are born in Shen (Monkey), thus beginning with the Shaoyin of the seventh month. Yang flows from the left, hence left to right; Yin flows from the right, hence right to left.)</p>
<p>Jia governs the left hand of Shaoyang, Ji governs the right hand of Shaoyang, Yi governs the left hand of Taiyang, Wu governs the right hand of Taiyang, Bing governs the left hand of Yangming, and Ding governs the right hand of Yangming.

<p>When the elbow is warm, the heat is above the waist; when the hand is warm, the heat is below the waist; when the front of the elbow is warm, the heat is in the front of the chest; when the back of the elbow is warm, the heat is in the shoulders and back; when the center of the arm is warm, the heat is in the waist and abdomen; if three to four inches below the back of the elbow is warm, there are parasites in the intestine; if the palm is warm, there is heat in the abdomen; if the palm is cold, there is cold in the abdomen; if there are blue blood vessels on the white flesh of the fish, there is cold in the stomach. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The path of the hand Tai Yin meridian starts from the lesser merchant at the tip of the finger, goes past the Shu point, travels through the channel, and enters the cubit at the point of the Lesser Marsh.

The pulse of the elbow starts at the inch and goes down to the cubit. The hand starts at the cubit and goes up to the inch. The warm sensation in front of the elbow indicates heat above the waist; the warm sensation in the hand indicates heat below the waist. This measures the skin and assesses the shape of the body above and below, hence the diagnosis is inverted compared to the pulse evaluation. The front of the elbow is where the hand Jue Yin&#39;s curve marsh is located, and the back of the elbow is where the hand Shao Yang&#39;s celestial well is located.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p>Regarding stool that is reddish and loose, if the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, it is difficult to resolve. If the pulse is weak but the hands and feet are warm, it is easy to resolve.</p>
<p>Note: The term &#39;reddish and loose stool&#39; refers to a distinction between yellow and red. In the middle burner, the turbid residue is transformed into fluids, leading to the formation of blood, which travels through the channels and is called the nourishing Qi. Food and drink regularly coexist in the stomach, forming turbid residue, which passes down into the large intestine, aiding in the separation of essences that seep into the bladder. If the stool is reddish and loose, it indicates that blood and turbid residue from the middle burner are moving downward together. Loose stools indicate a deficiency in the large intestine, causing it to be unable to properly separate the essences. This causes a deficiency in both the intestines and stomach; the fluids from the middle burner cannot nourish the pulse, thus resulting in a weak pulse. Conversely, when the hands and feet are warm, it indicates the receipt of vital energy from the lower burner, hence the ease of resolution.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

It should be treated quickly; if the blackness is removed, it will not worsen. If left untreated, death may occur within a hundred days. </p>
<p>Note: The yangming channel of the foot originates from the point next to the big toe, hence the sore appears beside the foot and is named &quot;Li Ying.&quot; The blackness refers to the color of water; if it is not promptly treated to remove the blackness, coldness will dominate and the earth element will fail.</p>
<p>When a sore arises on the toe, it is called a &quot;Tuo Ying.&quot; Its appearance is red-black, and if left untreated, it leads to death. If it is not red-black, it will not cause death. If it is not diminishing, it must be urgently excised; otherwise, it will result in death.</p>
<p>Note: This &quot;Tuo Ying,&quot; attributed to the lesser yin poison, manifests from within to the outside, hence called &quot;Tuo Ying,&quot; referring to a departure from yin to yang. The sore on the toe refers to the big toe of the foot. The lesser yin harbors the primordial water and fire; a red-black appearance indicates that the toxicity of water and fire is excessively potent, leading to an untreatable death. If it is not red-black, the toxic qi has diminished, thus not leading to death. If the sore does not recede, urgent amputation of the toe is necessary; otherwise, the toxic qi will penetrate the various channels and result in death.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Different Conditions of Weakness in the Feet</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between foot qi and qi foot lies in the fact that foot qi is characterized by the invasion of internal evil toxins into the feet, while qi foot is caused by external influences such as wind, cold, heat, and humidity that penetrate the feet and knees and gradually affect the internal organs. Both conditions result in the body being deprived of balance, leading to similar ailments. </p>
<p>In treatment, there is a hierarchy; consequently, one must discern the underlying causes rather than ignoring them, as this can lead to ineffective healing. Additionally, the emotions of joy, anger, worry, and cool or hot conditions can affect the limbs, particularly the feet and knees, presenting symptoms akin to wind-related joint ailments. However, when the issue originates externally, it is termed foot qi, whereas when it comes from within, it is referred to as qi foot.</p>
<p>For foot qi, one should first treat the internal problems before addressing the external, through nourishing the strong and supporting the weak. The prevalence of foot qi can be attributed to the heart and lung meridians originating in the hands, while the spleen, kidney, and liver meridians emerge from the feet. The hands clear internal evils, while the feet bear the burden of external toxins, making them most affected by wind, cold, heat, and humidity.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from this condition often do so gradually, starting with subtle signs that go unnoticed. Those who become aware may misunderstand, while practitioners may attribute the symptoms to other ailments, leading to unclear treatment and worsening conditions. What begins as a minor issue can escalate into a severe state, affecting the internal organs and resulting in pain across various body parts without the individual even realizing it.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition begins at the knees and is referred to as &quot;foot qi.&quot; The examination of the pulse and the body&#39;s state should be thorough. A floating and taut pulse arises from wind, a moist and weak pulse from dampness, a surging and rapid pulse from heat, a slow and thick pulse from cold, a slippery and faint pulse from deficiency, and a firm and solid pulse from excess. If it is in the upper part of the body, it manifests upwards; if in the lower part, it manifests downwards; if in the middle, it manifests centrally. Stagnation is due to qi, dispersal due to worry, tightness due to anger, and thinness due to grief. Wind leads to sweating and recovery, dampness to warmth and recovery, heat to resolution and recovery, and cold to smoothing and recovery. Deficiency should be supplemented, excess should be drained, qi should flow, worry should be eased, anger should be transformed, and grief should be harmonized. A healer who understands these principles is called a good doctor. Foot qi disease is transmitted to the heart and liver, with a mortality rate near 100% if untreated. When it enters the heart, it causes confusion, delusions, vomiting, inability to eat, and restless sleep. The pulse at the left wrist may alternate between large and small, appearing and disappearing. When it enters the kidneys, both the waist and feet swell, urination becomes obstructed, moaning is incessant, and the eyes and forehead turn dark. At times, it affects the chest and abdomen, causing difficulty in breathing, and the pulse at the left wrist may be absent. This should be examined carefully.</p>

<p>Discussion on wind poison symptoms: Reviewing various classic texts, there are often discussions about weakness in the feet, yet this ailment was rare in ancient times. Since the Yongjia period when many scholars migrated south, numerous cases have appeared. In Jiangdong, there are practitioners who focus on classic methods and excel in these treatments, achieving great success due to the teachings of these two figures. Furthermore, between the Song and Qi dynasties, there were deep masters of Buddhist teachings who recorded their methods in old texts, compiling nearly a hundred treatments for foot weakness. In the Zhou and Wei dynasties, this disease seemingly did not exist; thus, Master Yao&#39;s compilations did not receive much attention, and Xu Wang&#39;s records were not taken seriously. Hence, even when there were three methods practiced, the teachings were not uniform, and not caring for frost and dew, as well as temperature variations, led to a lack of understanding of the disease in regions such as Shanxi and Hebei.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

Those who do not adapt to the local environment have invariably faced troubles. Recently, even among Chinese scholars and officials who do not traverse the rivers and seas, there are those who suffer from this issue. This is largely due to the current state of affairs, where the prevailing attitudes are confused, and all things seem to be equalized. However, this affliction begins at the feet: it manifests as swelling in the legs, and is commonly referred to as “gout” by contemporaries. According to historical masters, the weak-footed are meant in this context. These masters have described various remedies for weak feet, including over eighty potent formulas, such as those using lotus leaves and yellow essence from Mount Yongping, which are all quite essential. Yet, for those studying these remedies, they often seem cumbersome, as it is essentially a compilation of prescriptions. In times of urgent need, one cannot rely on detailed guidance.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On How It Affects the Feet</strong></p>
<p>The question is asked: When people are affected by wind toxins, they can fall ill anywhere; why is it particularly focused on the feet? The answer is: Humans have five organs, with the heart and lungs connected to the hands and fingers, while the liver, kidneys, and spleen are associated with the feet and toes. The energy of wind toxins arises from the ground, and the cold, heat, wind, and humidity of the earth create vapor. Since the feet are always in contact with the ground, those afflicted by wind toxins will first be affected at their feet. If the illness does not heal over time, it may then spread to the limbs, abdomen, back, head, and neck. At first, one may not be aware of it, but over time, the chronic nature of the illness becomes evident. The classics say this is a transmission of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>On Recognizing Its Manifestation</strong></p>
<p>All cases of foot ailments are caused by exposure to wind toxins. Most people do not recognize this illness immediately; it may only manifest after the onset of another sickness, or one may suddenly feel lethargic, remaining inactive for two to three days before noticing it. Many lesser-skilled doctors do not understand this condition and mistakenly treat the symptoms as other diseases, often leading to fatal outcomes. Therefore, this illness frequently goes unrecognized. It begins very subtly, and one may feel normal in terms of food intake, hydration, and play, but suddenly experiences weakness in the feet, unable to move. This is the distinct sign. The Yellow Emperor states: It is a lingering issue of wind and dampness causing obstruction.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Manifestations of Wind Toxins</strong></p>
<p>In cases of foot ailments, one may not feel any unusual symptoms in the feet, yet discomfort can be present in the head, neck, and arms. Additionally, there may be difficulties in various parts, yet the heart and internal organs suffer from distress. There are those afflicted by wind toxins who might experience symptoms such as vomiting upon seeing food, aversion to food odors, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. Some may feel a palpitating sensation in the chest and desire to avoid bright light, or experience a foggy mind and forgetfulness, with speech becoming disordered. Others may have fevers and headaches, or feel extreme cold and pain throughout the body, or experience muscle cramps, swelling of the legs, or stubbornness in limb movements. Sometimes, they may face spasms in the joints or numbness in the lower abdomen. All these are manifestations of foot ailments and are also referred to as symptoms of wind toxins. </p>
<p>The signs can be difficult to discern, requiring careful observation; otherwise, one may miss crucial indicators. Once the illness develops, treatment can be challenging, particularly for women. Furthermore, there are women who, after childbirth, often suffer due to exposure to cool conditions in spring and summer, which can lead to these toxins, so caution is advised. Symptoms include heat, discomfort, palpitations, irritability, and nausea—all indicators of this condition. Additionally, if one feels a cold sensation in the lower abdomen and experiences discomfort with urination that is different from their usual state, this is also a sign of foot ailments. Pain and weakness are associated with dampness and obstruction.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Causes of Disease</strong></p>
<p>In all four seasons, one should not sit or stand for long in damp and cold places. Also, one must not, when drunk and sweating, remove clothing, shoes, or socks to cool off in the wind, as this can lead to foot ailments. If, during the hot months, one sits or stands for too long in damp places, the heat and humidity can penetrate the meridians, causing pain and discomfort in the limbs. Conversely, if one sits or stands in damp and cold places during the cold months, the cold and dampness may enter the meridians, leading to intense coldness and cramps throughout the body. If one cools off in the wind after being overheated, the resulting illness can lead to stubborn pain and twitching in the flesh, gradually moving towards the head. </p>
<p>On ordinary days, when there is suddenly extreme heat that is unbearable, one must not immediately seek relief in the cold. If a severe cold follows, one cannot endure it, and such conditions will lead to illness. There are diligent scholars focused on their studies, who sit or stand for long periods in damp places, unable to move, and when a cold wind strikes, it invades the meridians, unbeknownst to them, resulting in sickness. Thus, people afflicted by wind toxins may first experience symptoms in their fingers and toes, as excessive sweating opens the pores and allows the wind to enter swiftly. Symptoms may also first appear in the soles of the feet, or in the arches, or in the lower legs, inside and out.</p>
<p>To prevent illness, at the first signs of discomfort, one should apply moxibustion to the affected area with three to twenty strong treatments, and thus recover, preventing recurrence. The Yellow Emperor states: cooling off in the wind, or drunkenness followed by retreat indoors can lead to such diseases.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Differences of Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>It is asked: Why do those who are afflicted experience both cold and heat? The answer is: The body has three yin and three yang. Among the cold are three yang, where the problem must be cold; among the heat are three yin, where the problem must be heat. Therefore, the manifestations of cold and heat differ internally and externally. Heat is treated with cold remedies, and cold is treated with heat remedies, according to one’s intentions. When the spleen suffers from yang poison, it manifests as stubborn heat; when the kidneys suffer from yin dampness, it manifests as cold stagnation.</p>
<p><strong>On Diseases Following Beriberi</strong></p>
<p>Though suffering from beriberi, one may still have issues with stones, which must be treated with pressing stone remedies. When diseases arise due to beriberi, various remedies can be applied. If there are difficulties with urination, then herbs like polyporus and poria, along with other diuretics, should be used for treatment; if bowel movements are extremely hard, then the Five Soft Hemp Seed Pills and similar remedies should be used; if the body is swollen and water retention occurs, then one should use remedies from the water treatment prescriptions. The same approach applies to other ailments, and there should be no restriction.</p>
<p><strong>On the Urgency of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Whenever there is a slight abnormality in symptoms, one must be greatly alarmed and decisively treat it as a priority, without delay. If qi rises into the abdomen, whether it is swollen or not, the chest and sides may feel full, and qi rises to the shoulders; if it is urgent, death can occur in an instant, while a more moderate case may lead to death within several days. One cannot afford to delay. Signs of urgency include a rapid pulse, constant shortness of breath, instances of sweating, alternating chills and fever, persistent vomiting—all of which indicate a likely fatal outcome.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Efficacy of Medication: Real and Imagined</strong></p>
<p>All cases of beriberi result from an excess of vital energy, leading to death; there has never been someone who died from taking medicine that caused deficiency. Therefore, those with beriberi should not receive excessive tonics, nor should they undergo drastic purging; ultimately, they need not fear deficiency, hence they should avoid preemptive herbal concoctions. Those who do otherwise tend to perish unheeded.</p>
<p><strong>On the Examination of Patients and Inquiry into Illness</strong></p>
<p>In the world, there are many patients whose friends and acquaintances come to inquire about their ailments, yet such individuals often lack practical experience and have never consulted a remedy. They claim to possess knowledge, misleadingly presenting themselves as experts and spouting erroneous theories; some say it is deficiency, others claim it is excess, some declare it is wind, while others assert it is sorcery; some attribute it to water or stone phlegm, presenting a myriad of fallacies and contradictions. This confuses the patient, leaving them uncertain, and as time is fleeting, disaster can strike suddenly, causing everyone to disperse. Therefore, it is crucial to have reputable individuals or esteemed doctors who understand the nuances of illness, explore remedies deeply, and possess a comprehensive understanding of historical and contemporary practices. Only those with clarity on these matters should examine patients; otherwise, it can lead to grave mistakes. I lament the many who fail in this regard, thus I seek to elucidate these matters clearly, providing detailed descriptions of ailments, enabling future patients to protect themselves. However, if any symptoms match, one must adhere to an appropriate remedy and not rely on the theories of outsiders, thereby inviting unnecessary distress and regret. By understanding the prescribed remedies, healing is not difficult; one must not trust misleading words that lead to self-deception. I have once prepared a decoction of winter cherry, which has proven effective for treating beriberi; patients must use it urgently.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Examination of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>In cases of &quot;flat-foot disease&quot; (脚气), although many examinations and observations are made, it is vital that the three positions of the pulse do not contradict the four seasons in order to be auspicious; if they oppose the four seasons, do not treat. As mentioned in the &quot;Pulse Classic,&quot; I shall not elaborate here. Those who are originally slender and dark are easier to treat, while those who are large, with thick flesh that is red or white, are difficult to cure. People with darker skin endure wind and dampness better, while those with red or white skin do not. Thin individuals have firm flesh, while fat individuals have soft flesh; soft flesh is more susceptible to deep-seated diseases which are harder to cure.</p>
<p><strong>On Swelling and Non-Swelling</strong></p>
<p>When a person suffers from &quot;flat-foot disease&quot; for a long time without recognizing it, and later develops another illness which resolves, they may then suffer from vomiting and weakened feet again. Upon diagnosis, I inform them they have flat-foot disease. The patient replies, &quot;I have never suffered from swollen feet; why do you call it flat-foot?&quot; They refuse to take the medicine. I regard it as a stone manifestation. In the midst of uncertainty, they die within a short period. Hence, flat-foot disease should not only be considered through swelling; there are cases with swelling and without swelling. Those who experience stubborn lower abdomen numbness often do not have swollen feet. Stubborn lower abdomen issues for merely three to five days can lead to vomiting, a condition termed &quot;flat-foot invading the heart.&quot; Such cases are perilous and may result in death imminently. In general, when flat-foot disease reaches the heart, it is difficult to treat, as kidney water overcomes heart fire.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the case of beriberi, one must be particularly cautious regarding sexual activity, mutton, beef, fish, garlic, shepherd’s purse, mustard greens, wild greens, bottle gourds, alcohol, flour, ghee, unpasteurized milk, pork, chicken, goose, and duck. It is advisable to use carp heads in prescribed treatments. All these should be strictly avoided, and one must also refrain from intense anger. Only acceptable foods are polished rice, corn, fermented soybeans, scallions, leeks, garlic chives, peppers, ginger, and orange peels. Additionally, sour fruits and foods must also be avoided; those who consume them cannot recover. Fresh cow&#39;s milk and raw chestnuts are highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>On the Duration of Recovery for Those Who Can Be Treated</strong></p>
<p>Many people suffer fatal outcomes from beriberi, which can be categorized into three types: injury from sleeping late, arrogance and excessive pride, and doubt and indecision. These three conditions lead to certain death. Thus, it appears that there are genuinely no good doctors; even when good doctors exist, patients without the right disposition to accept treatment are quite rare. Just as a fine steed may go unrecognized by a wise trainer, and a talented mentor may find no one to teach, the same holds true for such illnesses. </p>
<p>Currently, for those who are ill and possess an appropriate disposition for acceptance, if I treat them, they can be cured in no more than ten days. However, for those without such a disposition, treatment is unnecessary. Even if it can be treated, recovery may never come. This principle applies not only to beriberi but to all diseases. Good medicine and wise words must be visibly appropriate; they cannot be forced upon anyone. Treatment should be given to those who have faith in it and not to the doubtful.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

If the wind is strong, one should prepare the Decoction of Overcoming the Servant and add four liang of white atractylodes. If the pulse is floating, large, tight, and starts to quicken, the Bamboo Juice Decoction should be made. If the patient has a pulse that is weak and thin, the Wind Guiding Decoction is appropriate. This type of pulse is often due to deficiency. If there is severe deficiency with shortness of breath and lack of strength, one may prescribe a nourishing decoction in accordance with the temperature of the illness. If not yet recovered, the Bamboo Juice Decoction should still be administered. If the patient has a floating, large, and rapid pulse, this is the most severe among the three pulse categories. Alternatively, if the pulse is deep, thin, and rapid, it is equally a dreadful pulse. A floating, large pulse indicates an external illness, while a deep, thin one indicates an internal ailment; treatment methods do not differ, and one must be attentive to the pulse&#39;s indications.

If the Zhuli Decoction induces a downward effect, it is certainly beneficial. If after taking three doses of Zhuli Decoction the pulse remains unchanged and there is severe bloating, one can use a large turtle shell decoction to induce a downward action. If the decoction is exhausted and does not induce movement, one can use pill medicine to assist the decoction in this regard. Subsequently, continue taking Zhuli Decoction to ensure the pulse is weakened and to stabilize the breath before stopping. One may then take the Thirty-Two Description of Eight Winds powder. Furthermore, at the onset of the illness, one should apply wild kudzu paste twice daily; this will alleviate stubborn numbness and weakness in the legs.

<p>　　伤寒只传足经，不传手经。地之寒暑风湿，皆作蒸气，足常履之，遂成脚气，所以病证与伤寒相近。其脉浮而弦者起于风，濡而弱者起于湿，洪而数者起于热，迟而濇者起于寒。风者汗而愈，湿者温而愈，热者下而愈，寒者熨而愈。脚气之病，始得不觉，因他病乃知。毒气入心，则小腹顽痹不仁，令人呕吐，死在朝夕矣。然终是与伤寒不同者，孙真人云：卒起脚屈弱不能转动，有此为异耳。要之，有脚气之人，先从脚起，或先缓弱疼痹，寒气胜者为痛痹，有寒故痛也；或行起忽倒，或两胫肿痛，亦有不肿者；或脚膝枯细，或心中忪悸，或小腹不仁。盖病久入深，荣卫之行濇，皮肤不荣，故为不仁。不仁者，皮顽不知有无也。<a id="orig-66p" href="#trans-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Athlete&#39;s Foot</strong>  </p>
<p>Cold-induced illnesses primarily affect the feet rather than the hands. The cold, heat, dampness, and wind of the earth create steaming vapors; frequent exposure to these elements leads to athlete&#39;s foot, causing its symptoms to resemble those of a cold. The pulse tends to be floating and string-like due to wind, moist and weak from dampness, surging and rapid from heat, and slow and thin from cold. For wind-related issues, sweating is the remedy; for dampness, warmth is needed; for heat, purging is beneficial; and for cold, applying heat helps.  </p>
<p>The onset of athlete&#39;s foot can be subtle and is often recognized only due to other illnesses. Toxic energy entering the heart leads to numbness in the lower abdomen, causing vomiting, which can be lethal rapidly. However, it remains distinct from colds; as Master Sun noted: a sudden weakness in the feet that prevents movement signifies this difference.  </p>
<p>In summary, individuals with athlete&#39;s foot typically experience symptoms starting from the feet, which may first present as mild weakness or pain, with pain resulting from excessive cold, leading to a painful sensation. Sometimes, individuals may suddenly collapse while walking, experience swelling and pain in the legs, or suffer from thin and weak legs, palpitations, or numbness in the lower abdomen. The prolonged nature of the illness leads to deep internal complications, hindering the smooth circulation of vital energy and resulting in skin that lacks nourishment, leading to numbness. Numbness signifies that the skin is desensitized, unable to perceive what is present or absent.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some may experience body twitching, while others may see food and vomit, detesting the smell of food. They may feel fullness in the chest and urgency of breath, or have soreness all over, all indicative of &quot;foot qi.&quot; The Yellow Emperor refers to this as &quot;wind-damp obstruction.&quot; Chronic weakness is termed &quot;wind,&quot; while pain is called &quot;damp obstruction.&quot; Obstruction means a closure; being closed off and insensitive is thus termed obstruction. In the presence of cold among the three yangs, the issue must be cold; for this, use “Yuebi Decoction” or “Small Renewing Life Decoction.” When “Small Renewing Life Decoction” is prepared, add fresh ginger juice for the quickest effect. In the presence of heat among the three yins, the issue must be heat; modify “Small Renewing Life Decoction” by removing aconite and reducing cinnamon by half. For severe agitation, “Purple Snow” is best. For constipation, use “Spleen Contraction Pill,” “Divine Function Pill,” “Five Soft Pills,” “Big Three Abdominal Powder,” or “Papaya Powder.” The ailments of foot qi are all due to excess qi, and none have died from weakness caused by medication. Headaches with body heat, limb joint pain, and weak flexed feet indicate that the person has chronic foot qi, which is now being triggered. For swollen feet, “Betel Nut Powder” is indicated. For discussing foot qi, “Thousand Gold” and “External Treasury” offer the most detailed accounts, and thus will not be repeated here. Generally, “Yuebi Decoction,” “Small Renewing Life Decoction,” “Job&#39;s Tears Wine Method,” “Spleen Contraction Pill,” and “Divine Function Pill” are essential medicines. Acupuncture is also excellent. Taking tonics and using decoctions for washing are major prohibitions for doctors.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jisheng Fang</strong> 【Song - Yan Yonghe】</p>
<p><strong>Foot Disease</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; says that foot disease is caused by the invasion of cold and toxic winds. It further states: the cold, heat, wind, and dampness of the earth all produce steam, and when the feet are often exposed to this, foot disease results. However, in ancient times, there was no concept of foot disease; in the time of the Yellow Emperor, it was called &quot;Jue.&quot; Between the Han dynasties, it was referred to as &quot;Huanfeng,&quot; and after the Song and Qi dynasties, it became known as foot disease. Although the names differ, the essence remains the same. </p>
<p>From this, we can observe that cold, heat, wind, and dampness can all lead to this condition, not only cold and toxic winds. The disease usually goes unnoticed at first and may arise due to another illness, sometimes suddenly causing great discomfort, only to be felt several days later. It often begins in the feet, presenting as mild pain or weakness, sudden collapses during movement, swollen legs, thin and withered feet and knees, heart palpitations, numbness in the lower abdomen, cramps throughout the body, nausea or vomiting when seeing food, aversion to food smells, chest tightness and shortness of breath, or generalized aches. These variations in symptoms reflect the different manifestations of the illness. Generally, with cold conditions affecting the three Yang channels, there will be cold symptoms; with heat conditions affecting the three Yin channels, there will be heat symptoms. Indeed, these words are true.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In discussing the pulse, the floating and string-like pulse arises from wind, the soft and weak pulse arises from dampness, the full and rapid pulse arises from heat, and the slow and rough pulse arises from cold. Wind is treated by sweating, dampness is treated by warmth, heat is treated by purging, and cold is treated by warming. For those suffering from foot conditions, acupuncture should be employed quickly. Using decoctions for washing is a major prohibition in treatment. </p>
<p>Foot ailments arise from kidney deficiency; however, women also suffer from foot conditions due to the deficiency of blood and the stasis of phlegm, as well as emotional disturbances such as anger and sorrow, leading to the development of this illness. Given that many women suffer from this, it can be understood that these ailments due to blood deficiency resemble those from kidney deficiency in men. </p>
<p>The treatment for women is fundamentally the same as for men, but must also include medications for emotional disturbances, which will always yield results. Furthermore, the methods of tonifying and purging should align with the four seasons: in spring and autumn, one should urgently tonify and purge; during summer, when conditions are severe, one must focus on promoting sweating; and after the onset of winter, one should adjust treatment according to whether the condition is improving or worsening, with slight nourishing added. </p>
<p>Otherwise, qi and blood will continuously weaken, leading to recurring issues every year with rising heat—a natural consequence. The general principles of treatment do not exceed this. In addition, throughout the seasons, one must be careful to regulate and manage, avoiding prolonged sitting or standing in cold, damp places, and during hot months, one should not expose oneself to damp areas. By being careful in these respects and treating according to the symptoms, recovery will certainly occur.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Instructions for Treating Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>Carbuncles arise when the lung meridian is overheated, manifesting on the fingertips and requiring urgent attention; if not alleviated within seven to eight days, they can be fatal. Treatment can begin within four days by puncturing. If a black sore is not too severe, treatment can still be effective; however, a severely black sore post-festival indicates death. Those that can still be treated after the festival require medicinal intervention. </p>
<p>The appearance is characterized by small, dark lesions as large as millet grains, while larger ones can be the size of plums, ranging in color from red to black, occasionally showing blue and white, often surrounded by a solid core, which is the root. They are not swollen, but may be excruciatingly painful, affecting the heart and reaching the bones, and may also cause the body to feel warm. If treatment is delayed, the poison ascends, causing the face to swell with purple-black blisters that can corrupt the organs, leading to death. </p>
<p>In the south, this condition is known as &quot;toxic invasion,&quot; as there’s a fear that cutting off the fingers will allow the poison to spread upwards, leading to a high chance of fatality. Sudden, sharp pains in the fingertips that seem unbearable may appear red or yellow, or dark blue or black. If there is foul-smelling blood or pus between the teeth, death is likely within seven days. </p>
<p>For those with thickened flesh, one should excise the affected area and cauterize it with iron until charred like coal. It is also advisable to apply moxibustion over the carbuncle vigorously, and to take juice from sunflower roots, woad flowers, bamboo sap, rhinoceros horn juice, bitter orange soup, and detoxifying drinks. If one vomits pus and blood and does not seek treatment, one should cover the pus and blood with ash. If not, the toxic gas can infect others. Carbuncles can cause immediate harm, as evil winds penetrate the muscle and veins, initially going unnoticed. </p>
<p>Once the poison has become congested and manifests fiercely, tiny and deep lesions may appear darkly or murkily. The ailment targets the heart; if the condition slightly eases, it can lead to organ invasion.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

<p>Heavenly snake poison arises when the heart is afflicted by wind injury at the fingers, elbows, and arms. This signifies a severe toxic condition, and one should treat it with a pain-relieving and qi-flowing drink. If this condition has not yet matured, it is inappropriate to immediately use knives or needles to pierce the corrupted flesh, as it may aggravate the situation. If it becomes deeply rooted, it will be difficult to treat, and even after breaking down, it may take years to regenerate flesh; one should apply Erhuang San to the area.</p>
<h3>Arm and Face Poison</h3>
<p>Arm and face poison manifests on the surface of the arm, resulting from blockage in the liver and lung meridians, leading to stagnation of qi and blood which gathers into toxins; this is a severe condition. One should use a detoxifying and qi-flowing drink, followed by a pain-relieving internal tonic. Surrounding the affected area, one should apply Jinku San as a poultice.</p>
<h3>Palm Poison</h3>
<p>Palm poison affects the right hand due to yin fire. The qi and blood of the Taiyin and Yangming flow into the left Jueyin meridian, while the poison of the left hand arises from heart fire, with the Taiyang flowing into the right foot Taiyin Yangming. The earth regenerates flowing through the five phases—mother and child generating and nurturing each other. This condition may stem from emotions like joy, anger, worry, and thoughts, or from cold congealing qi and blood, leading to blockage and toxin accumulation. One should use a pain-relieving and detoxifying medicine, followed by an internal tonic to promote qi flow, and externally apply Jinku San as a poultice.</p>
<h3>Wrist Poison</h3>
<p>Wrist poison occurs on the back of the hand, resulting from wind, cold, joy, anger, fright, and phlegm affecting the heart, with blood failing to circulate, resulting in toxin formation. One should use a pain-relieving and poison-expelling powder, along with an internal tonic for clearing qi. It may be applied through the palm or the outer wrist, and further treated with Sanyang Neituo San.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On feverish conditions</strong><br>The conditions of the lesser yang channel often exhibit more qi and less blood, as the lesser yang possesses a corresponding fire, even more so than the extreme yin. This is due to excessive worry and mental labor, influenced by external forces and internal emotions. It is advisable to anticipate difficulties in muscle growth and to avoid reckless use of harsh medicines. However, if the symptoms manifest as red swelling, similar to millet, do not underestimate them merely due to their small size.</p>
<p><strong>On cold sores</strong><br>Cold sores arise from the alterations in nutritional intake, lingering toxins from wind and dampness, and prolonged exposure to cold weather. These conditions attack the area below the knee and affect the spleen channel. Initially appearing like grains of rice, they gradually become ulcerated, resembling coal in color, as putrid blood invades and damages bone and flesh, leading to significant issues. Over years, the joints cause pain and do not regenerate muscle. Begin treatment with an infusion of mugwort, snake bed seed, perilla, and agrimony for washing, and internally take medicines like astragalus, white atractylodes, black atractylodes, angelica, white peony, forsythia, and raw rehmannia. For external treatment, apply a medicinal paste wrapped in paper. Also, focus on internal reflection to alleviate labor or strain.</p>
<p><strong>On ulcerations</strong><br>Generally, the symptoms in the lower body primarily involve black atractylodes, complemented by the pungency of coptis, and combined with green tangerine peel, along with licorice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Leg Wind</strong></p>
<p>This boil is located in the small intestine and kidney meridians, caused by cold and heat, with evil energy and toxins flowing through both legs; this is known as wandering toxicity. One should use a perilla (zisu) decoction to treat it, followed by a decoction to dispel toxicity. For external treatment, first apply golden silk paste for four to five days to draw out the toxic fluid, and then use ointments for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>Crane knee wind is akin to dysentery wind and drumstick wind. The circulation of qi and blood harmonizes throughout the body; if affected by cold, the flow slows down and is insufficient, whereas heat stimulates it too rapidly. Internal injury from emotional distress or external injury from environmental factors leads to irregular circulation of qi and blood, resulting in illness. It often stems from prolonged heat accumulation followed by invasion of damp heat, obstructing the flow of blood and causing pain, particularly at night. Treatment requires warming and dispersing the cold dampness and expelling the accumulated heat. When blood flows freely in harmony with qi, the illness ceases. Alternatively, if one hastily resorts to potent medicines, suffers from overexertion, indulges in rich foods, or is affected by wind and rain, leg swelling and severe pain may arise from stagnant blood in the meridians. If left untreated for an extended period, it may lead to atrophy, resulting in knee swelling, muscle tightening, and severe pain, with weakness and gradual thinning of the legs, and dry, frail thighs and calves that cannot flex or extend. The appropriate treatment is to dispel wind, regulate qi, nourish blood, strengthen tendons, and remove dampness, allowing the smooth flow of qi and blood, leading to a natural recovery.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

<p>This poison affects the kidney channel and bladder, causing stagnation of qi and blood, while damp heat attacks the knee eye, forming poison. For treatment, apply crane&#39;s knee wind medicine externally, and use fragrant liquor decoction internally.</p>
<p><strong>Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Commonly said to be hard and without pus, little do people know that the swelling and hardness is due to internal pus that cannot surface at once. It needs to be guided out from within before one can pierce it with a needle.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Groove Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Bone groove abscess occurs above the knee and at the ankle wrist. Its pain feels like a knife-cut, while its itching is akin to insect-biting. Urgently use moxa on the abscess three to five times, then apply frankincense universal plaster, and take alum pills.</p>
<p><strong>Foot and Hand Manifestation</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from heat in the heart channel, resulting in uneven walking that harms the foot, causing blood to accumulate and form an abscess. The treatment is the same as for cold, leakage, damp poison.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Fistula Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This condition appears between the hand&#39;s yangming channels, initially as a grain and gradually enlarging like a red bean. The pain is unbearable, and it can grow to the size of a bayberry, with no blood or pus emerging, while poison flows through the channels and spreads throughout the body.

<p><strong>Foot Malady</strong></p>
<p>This condition affects the kidneys and connects to the Yangming meridian, causing pain in the heart. To treat it, use remedies for knee pain, heel sores, and &quot;crane knee wind.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Heel Sores</strong> (also known as &quot;cow pupa worm,&quot; &quot;earth chestnut&quot;)</p>
<p>These sores develop on the heel, typically due to injury from movement. They appear glassy with no pus, only a purple color, which means they should not be punctured. Initially, apply &quot;golden hoop powder&quot; or &quot;iron hoop powder.&quot; Avoid wind and cold; movement is not advised. First, take a purging medication to clear toxins, followed by a dampness-reducing papaya soup. Once ready to drain, use a needle to puncture and release the pus, applying golden silk and purple gold plasters.</p>
<p><strong>Shoe Lace Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Shoe lace ulcers occur beside the ankle, resulting from cold and damp exposure, leading to toxicity in the foot Yangming channel due to an accumulation of Qi and blood. Utilize &quot;pain-relieving flowing Qi drink&quot; for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Sole Malady</strong></p>
<p>The sole malady affects the kidney and heart channels in the foot, resulting in damp toxicity, termed &quot;sole carbuncle.&quot; One should take the &quot;pain-relieving flowing Qi drink&quot; alongside areca nut pills for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Wind Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>These ulcers arise from disturbances in women’s menstrual cycles, potentially occurring twice a month or being absent for a month. As a result, blood and Qi seep into the foot Yangming channel, leading to these sores. It is advisable to use &quot;wood fragrance flowing Qi drink&quot; and &quot;five accumulations powder,&quot; applying paper plaster externally.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Kidney Qi and Wind Poison</h3>
<p>This poison arises in the calves, affecting the bladder meridian; cold air harms the kidneys and lurks in the bladder, which is known as wind poison. One should use perilla flow qi drink and apply iron hoop powder externally.</p>
<h3>Internal and External Ulcers</h3>
<p>Internal and external ulcers arise alongside the three li and at the sides of the yin intersection. They occur due to cold air attacking the lower abdomen through the kidney meridian, with internal invasion of wind evil and external assault by cold air, possibly resulting from a collision injury. These ulcers gradually become necrotic, with pus that does not dry up, caused by the interplay of damp heat and wind poison.</p>
<h3>Three Chains of Mole Crickets</h3>
<p>This condition appears on both hands in three varieties: upper, middle, and lower. They are all caused by damp poison damaging the skin, the qi and blood injuring the kidneys, and anger injuring the heart, leading to stagnant blood and qi conflicts, resulting in this series of poison chains. Treatment involves flow qi drink, three fragrant internal expulsion powder, and pain-relieving descent qi drink.</p>
<h3>Interstitial Abscess</h3>
<p>This condition appears on the arms and is caused by the blockage of qi and blood in the liver meridian, resulting in toxic accumulation. One should use expulsion flow qi drink and toxic elimination flow qi drink for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wind Poison Abscess</h3>
<p>This condition occurs between the toes, due to blocked qi and blood causing stagnation in the spleen and stomach, potential damage to the meridians, overconsumption of fried foods, or accumulation of toxins forming sores. It may also occur if the wind enters through a deficiency. A warming internal qi-regulating drink is recommended. Pregnant women should adjust the dosage accordingly.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of typhoid with sweating in the hands and feet, how can this be clarified? The limbs are the source of all yang energies, and the stomach governs the limbs. Sweating in the hands and feet is a sign of yangming. When the pathogenic heat of the yang meridians spreads and affects yangming, it causes sweating in the hands and feet. Yangming is the master of bodily fluids, and when ill, there will be spontaneous sweating. One may experience sweating all over the body, only on the head, or specifically in the hands and feet, all of which belong to yangming. Why does this happen? If there is sweating all over the body, it is termed “heat exceeding,” indicating that the heat is expressed outward. If there is only sweating on the head, it shows the heat cannot extend outward but rather ascends. Sweat in the hands and feet indicates that heat is concentrated in the stomach, manifesting as fluid discharge. The texts state: when the hands and feet sweat profusely, there is a likelihood of constipation. If there is dripping sweat from the hands and feet, and if the stool is hard with difficulty in speaking, purging will lead to recovery. From this, it is evident that sweating in the hands and feet is caused by heat accumulating in the stomach. Some may ask if sweating in the hands and feet can occur due to cold accumulating in the stomach. The text says: when there is cold in the middle, one cannot eat, there is difficulty in urination, and there is profuse sweating in the hands and feet; this is indicative of wanting to form a stubborn mass, and indicates cold in the middle. Furthermore, heat accumulating in the stomach is a sign that one can purge, while cold accumulating in the stomach is a sign that one cannot purge. How can this be clarified? To distinguish between these two conditions, it can be said that when constipation is followed by diarrhea, this is due to cold in the stomach, where food and fluids are not differentiated, hence it cannot be purged. However, if this is accompanied by difficulty in stool and the signs of yangming are present, it indicates that it is a purgable condition, and one should be careful in diagnosing the illness.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Foot Edema in the Northern Regions</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When the sun prevails, fire energy becomes trapped within, dispersing outward, leading to swelling of the lower legs. Fluid accumulates internally, resulting in swelling externally. It also states: The spleen pulse is firm and long, and its color is yellow; this indicates illness characterized by a deficiency of qi. If it is soft and dispersed, lacking luster in color, this indicates foot swelling resembling water. </p>
<p>Those with spleen disorders experience heaviness in the body, muscle atrophy, inability to retract the feet, painful walking, and pain in the feet. This happens when excessive food intake generates insufficient qi and dampness accumulates below, thus dampness is received from the lower part. As mentioned, it is said that damp qi from the spleen and stomach flows downward, affecting the liver and kidneys, leading to pain in the legs and swelling of the feet. </p>
<p>The five grains enter the stomach, and the waste, fluids, and ancestral qi are divided into two channels. Thus, ancestral qi accumulates in the chest, exiting through the throat, traversing the heart and lungs to facilitate breathing. The nutritive qi secretes fluids, injecting them into the pulses, transforming them into blood to nourish the extremities and internally support the five organs and six bowels, responding to timely needs.</p>
<p>The defensive qi expels excessive energy and circulates in the gaps between the flesh of the extremities, constantly flowing without pause. Furthermore, the pathways of ancestral qi consider internal grains as a treasure; when the grains enter the stomach, they are transmitted through the pulses, overflowing within, spreading outward. The pure and specialized flow travels through the channels, continuously circulating, beginning and ending perpetually, which is known as the rhythm of heaven and earth.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sometimes, improper diet leads to a failure of the stomach’s energy to invigorate and the spleen’s energy to transform. The energy flows through the hundred channels, descending and affecting the liver and kidneys. The interaction of earth, wood, and water converges and descends to the feet, resulting in swelling and pain in the lower limbs, which is what is referred to as &quot;gout&quot; in Jin, as called by Su Jing. </p>
<p>For treating this ailment, one should eat heartily for breakfast, eat less for lunch, and it is best not to eat dinner at all, for fear of injuring the spleen and stomach&#39;s operational energies and losing their natural balance. Moreover, eating at night causes stagnation of blood and qi, leading to increased swelling and pain. In ancient times, this ailment was rare, but since the Southern migration during the Yongjia era, many scholars have suffered from it. Following the establishment of the Tang Dynasty, those who were tasked with governance in the southern regions, where the land is low and wet, often suffer from it due to the accumulation of mist and dew, as they are not accustomed to the water and soil conditions.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>People from the northern part of Guanshi do not recognize this ailment. The texts &quot;Wai Tai Mi Yao&quot; and &quot;Zong Lu&quot; also indicate that this condition is common in Jiangdong and Lingnan. This is likely due to the attack of dampness on a weakened constitution, which is why the classics state that it harms the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. Hence, the creation of treatment plans is based on the specific conditions of the land at that time. </p>
<p>Now, observing the northern regions which are crisp and free of low-lying damp areas, and considering that the pores are tight and external pathogens are hard to invade, one wonders why there are individuals suffering from this ailment. It is likely due to excessive consumption of milk, rich wines, and damp foods, compounded by overindulgence in nurturing one&#39;s body that fosters dampness. As moisture accumulates and cannot be expelled, it settles in the feet and ankles, leading to prolonged swelling and pain. This issue arises from the consumption of these damp substances, which is distinctly different from how ailments are treated in the southern regions.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>East Garden Ten Treatises</strong><br><em>Yuan Dynasty - Li Gao</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Distinction Between Internal and External Injuries to the Limbs</strong>  </p>
<p>Internal injuries, such as illnesses, occur when the vital energy of the heart and lungs is severed from the outside, leading to laziness and a propensity to lie down, with heavy and unresponsive limbs. This is due to heat damaging the original qi. The spleen governs the limbs, and when affected by heat, there is insufficient energy to move. The classics say that heat damages qi, and when heat is present, bones can decay and tendons can loosen; this is what is referred to.  </p>
<p>In contrast, external injuries from wind and cold indicate that the vital energy of the kidneys and liver has been severed internally. The kidneys govern the bones and are associated with cold; the liver governs the tendons and is associated with wind. Since ancient times, diseases of the kidneys and liver have been treated similarly because they support one another. Thus, the classics say that the gallbladder governs the tendons, and the bladder governs the bones.  </p>
<p>Whether it is a stroke or an injury from cold, on the day the illness occurs, one feels the need to lie down; it is not that one cannot be supported, but that the tendons and bones are painful and unable to move, thus indicating a physical injury. The classics state: &quot;Cold harms the form; cold causes the tendons to cramp and the bones to ache.&quot; This is what is referred to.  </p>
<p>For internal injuries and labor, along with irregularities in diet, if one experiences heat in the palms and coolness in the backs of the hands, it indicates internal issues; whereas, if external injuries from wind and cold are present, the backs of the hands feel hot while the palms do not. This distinction is remarkably clear.  </p>
<p><strong>Inability to Control the Limbs</strong>  </p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are deficient, one feels lazy and prefers to lie down, with involuntary limbs; during the autumn dryness, when damp heat diminishes, the body feels heavy and achy, with dry mouth and tongue, lack of taste in food, irregular bowel movements, frequent urination, loss of appetite, inability to digest food, and concurrent signs of lung disease, such as chills and a sad disposition, along with an unhappy, pale complexion—this is due to the yang qi not rising. It is advisable to promote the yang and augment the qi, and the formula for this is to enhance yang and strengthen the stomach.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Athlete&#39;s Foot</p>
<p>The disease known as athlete&#39;s foot is indeed caused by dampness. Dampness harms the skin, flesh, muscles, and tendons and relates to the lower parts of the body; however, it can arise in two ways. One is from external influences, and the other is from internal causes, hence the treatment methods should differ accordingly. Thus, it is necessary to discuss this in detail.</p>
<p>As for the disease, it presents symptoms without a name; the term athlete&#39;s foot originated with Su Jing during the Jin Dynasty, and it was not known in regions such as Guanzhong or Heshuo. Only in the South does the cold underground water and the clear, damp air penetrate the people, leading to the condition from the feet. The classics say: &quot;When clear dampness invades the empty, the illness arises from the lower parts.&quot;</p>
<p>Some might argue: &quot;Now in the North, the land is high and cold, and the people have close pores; why are there still many cases of this disease? Could it not be caused by the dampness of the land?&quot; The answer is: the disease in the South arises from external causes, while the disease in the North is due to internal factors. How can this be explained? Northerners often consume too much milk and drink alcohol excessively, impairing their health without restraint. Milk, in its essence, has the nature of milk, while its form and quality resemble water; the same applies to wine and sweet drinks. As food enters the stomach, the stomach&#39;s energy rises and mingles its essence with taste, spreading through the meridians and transforming into qi and blood. This nourishment supports the extremities and feeds the five organs and six bowels, creating a cycle of response that corresponds with the rhythms of nature. This is known as the equilibrium of heaven and earth, which relies on the abundance of vital energy when the spleen and stomach are uninjured.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the vital energy is insufficient, then the foundational energy of the stomach is inherently weak. When intake of food is excessive, the energy of the spleen and stomach gets injured, unable to properly transform and digest what is consumed; the essence and flavors cannot circulate smoothly, causing the nature of dampness to flow downward. Those conditions originating externally stop at the lower limbs, causing swelling and pain; while those arising from within might even reach the joints of the hands. The classics state that swelling of the feet and lower limbs is caused by water, with heavy swelling being due to the arrival of the Taiyin; this describes only the external causes. The methods of treatment have been elaborated by previous scholars. However, for internal conditions, there has yet to be a established treatment approach. Yang Dashou states that leg qi is a type of obstruction disease, treated with disseminating and unblocking medications to prevent Qi from becoming stagnant. If obstruction has already formed strongly, then cupping and removing the stasis in the blood is necessary. The classics say: if accumulation occurs, swelling and heat result. After cupping, treat with medication.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses the southern regions where the ground is weak and the water and soil are poor, influenced by mist and dew. The Jiangdong and Lingnan regions are generally like this. When transitioning from spring to summer, the mountains and forests are steamy and dense, and the air is filled with wind, dampness, and toxins; the feet may be affected, resulting in endemic leg qi. The symptoms include weakening and bending of the feet, gradually leading to pain and numbness, slight swelling of the shins, numbness of the lower abdomen, headaches, irritability, phlegm obstruction and regurgitation, intermittent chills and fevers, and difficulties in urination; in severe cases, it may attack the heart and become urgent, thus treatment cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to classical formulas; those skilled in this art, could they not be more prevalent among the Jiangyou region? </p>
<p>Regarding different methods, the northern regions are characterized by high elevations, exposed to cold and frigid winds.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Their custom is to drink thick yogurt and eat meat. Among those who drink thick yogurt, those who consume quickly and in large amounts are considered capable. The classics say that excessive drinking leads to reversed energy, and it is stated that food enters the yin and nourishes the yang; now they are going against the yang way, which is considered a reversal. Thick yogurt and strong wine are damp and hot substances associated with drinking. Furthermore, overindulgence in nourishment increases dampness as the water quality descends, causing energy to stagnate—hence it settles in the legs and calves, leading to swelling and pain over time, which is a result of improper diet.</p>
<p>The &quot;General Discussion on Ventilation and Solidification&quot; states: When grains are abundant but energy is lacking, dampness resides below. Moreover, the dampness and heat of thick yogurt and strong wine are even worse than that of grains. The &quot;Essential Discussions of the Ultimate Truth&quot; asserts that when the yin is strong, fire energy becomes trapped internally, spreading outward, leading to swelling in the legs and lower limbs. This is what they refer to. Thus, when drinks enter the stomach, the vital energy flows forth, rising to the spleen, which distributes the energy upward to the lungs, connecting with the water pathways and descending to the bladder, allowing the water essence to be distributed widely, aligning with the seasons and the five organs, balancing yin and yang for constancy. If food and drink are excessive, the stomach and intestines become harmed, and thus the stomach energy cannot transform properly, nor can the spleen energy be distributed, leading to stagnation in the liver and kidneys’ regions, settling in the legs and feet, compounded by excessive sexual activity, resulting in excessive yin and deficient yang, eventually leading to chronic ailments.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yang Dashou said: The illness of athlete&#39;s foot has historically been treated with purgatives, as it results from stagnation. However, one must not overdo it; excessive purging can harm the spleen and stomach, preventing qi from ascending and causing it to descend instead, leading to athlete&#39;s foot. On the other hand, if one does not purge sufficiently, the stagnant qi cannot disperse. Therefore, I have established formulas such as Qianghuo Daoti Decoction and Kaijie Daoyin Pill, which should be used based on careful consideration of the condition&#39;s nature.</p>
<p>The &quot;External Records&quot; states: First, avoid anger. Anger causes irritation, and irritation leads to the onset of athlete&#39;s foot. Second, refrain from speaking loudly. Loud speech damages the lungs, and when the lungs are harmed, it also triggers conditions. Additionally, one should not expose the feet; do not expose them to wind or water. Washing the feet with cold water is ill-advised, especially keeping the legs warm. Even in the summer, one should wear cotton trousers, and in winter, it is vital to keep the legs warm to induce a slight sweat, which is highly beneficial. Follow these guidelines for proper care.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Athlete&#39;s foot gradually weakens and damages the body; one should cut the nails of hands and feet on the days of Yin and Chou, cutting only a little into the flesh to dispel wind and dampness. In summer, the pores open, so it is unwise to sleep exposed to the wind. Waking can cause discomfort, so keep evil energies from lingering. Regular movement of the joints keeps them unblocked. This is essential for health and a method to ward off wind and evil.</p>
<p>For usual strength, after each meal, walk three to five hundred steps. If you feel fatigued, stop; the bad energy from the feet will disperse immediately, even if swelling occurs, the energy cannot rise. </p>
<p>Firstly, regarding diet, avoid excessive alcohol and rich foods, as overindulgence damages the spleen and stomach, leading to swelling in the legs and causing foot ailments. Secondly, desires should not be indulged; excessive cravings will cause symptoms. After eating, it is advisable to walk slowly for two to three hundred steps, not sweating excessively; if you feel tired, stop to prevent congestion. The classics say: &quot;The unhurried person walks.&quot; They also state that those suffering from dampness and obstruction should avoid warm, over-satisfying foods and wet conditions.</p>
<p>Arm and Foot Pain</p>
<p>Arm pain has six pathways; investigate which path the pain resides in to treat the energy and blood using appropriate medicinal methods. If the pain is exterior, do not hastily administer treatment; it requires careful differentiation. For foot pain, treat new illnesses with methods for gout. Chronic foot problems do not arise from athlete&#39;s foot, but rather should be treated using methods for rheumatism. Each condition has its own diagnosis. Gout often arises from blood deficiency, allowing cold and dampness to invade.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Gout</strong></p>
<p>Gout requires the use of medicines that dispel dampness, raising the humidity and accompanying the flow of Qi and blood. For gout that affects the heart, it is advisable to use the Four Substances Decoction, adding fried Huangbai; also, use the Yongquan acupoint, applying aconite powder mixed with saliva, and then using moxibustion to draw out the heat downwards. </p>
<p>If there is muscle movement in the big toe extending to the thigh near the waist, this is due to overindulgence and exposure to wind and cold, so it is proper to use the Four Substances Decoction combined with wine, qinpi (orange peel), safflower, dried atractylodes, nanking (south star), and ginger, decocted for consumption. Gout may involve damp heat or food accumulation, with the flow being windy dampness or cold dampness. </p>
<p>To combat dampness, focus on ingredients like Xianjue (immortal atractylodes), Baizhu (white atractylodes), Fangji (stephania), and Chuanxiong (chuanxiong), or use the Six Substances Aconite Decoction or the Pain Relief Decoction with Angelica. For severe Qi stagnation, utilize the Zhouche Pill or Exclude Dampness Pill. If there is retention of fluid, employ Dongyuan&#39;s Open and Guide Pill. For resolving exterior signs, use Ma Huang&#39;s Left Meridian Decoction and other medicines, choosing according to the meridians. </p>
<p>If there is also phlegm, Qi cold dampness together, increase the dosage of Wujisan (Five Accumulations Powder) with papaya. For dual resolution, use the Dahuang Left Meridian Decoction or Dongyuan&#39;s Qianghuo Guide to Disperse Powder. If regulating the blood is necessary, utilize the Eight Flavor Pill, or the Four Substances with Qianghuo and Tianma, or the Four Substances with Huangbai and Nanking, or the Jianbu Pill. </p>
<p>For dispelling wind and nourishing blood, using the Du Huojisheng Soup is the most effective.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a></p></div>

<p>Phlegm and blood heat are present. For blood heat, it is advisable to use Siwu decoction with Rhizoma Coptidis and Anemarrhena.</p>
<h3>Numbness in Hands and Feet</h3>
<p>Numbness in the hands and feet is related to qi deficiency; when it involves the body, it indicates damp phlegm or stagnant blood. Numbness in all ten fingers suggests that there is damp phlegm and stagnant blood in the stomach.</p>
<h3>Limb Joint Pain</h3>
<p>For limb joint pain, Qiang Huo should be used to dispel wind and dampness. For obese individuals with limb joint pain, it is often due to wind-dampness and phlegm flow disrupting the meridians, indicating that Nanxing and Banxia should be used. For thin individuals with limb joint pain, this signifies blood deficiency, and Siwu decoction should be combined with Fangfeng and Qiang Huo. If a thin person exhibits impatience along with limb joint pain and fever, it indicates blood heat, and Siwu decoction should include Huangqin and wine-fried Rhizoma Coptidis. If there is swelling and pain in the joints with a slippery pulse, drying dampness is necessary, recommending Cangzhu, Nanxing, along with qi-moving herbs such as Mukang, Zhihua, and Binglang; if it is below, add Hanfangji. If there is swelling and pain in the joints with a thin and rapid pulse, this signifies stagnant blood, suggesting the use of Tao Ren, Honghua, Danggui, Chuanxiong, and a light dose of Da Huang. If there is fatigue and weakness accompanied by limb joint pain, this indicates qi deficiency, possibly with phlegm flow, and it is best to use Ren, Shu, Xing, and Ban.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

<p>Hand pain manifests as swelling and discomfort, affecting the palm, fingers, and arms. For treatment, use Wujin Decoction or Juanbi Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>Arm pain can result from wind, cold, or dampness attacking the area, or from fluids accumulating, or due to lifting heavy objects. This may lead to swelling in some cases and not in others. Excluding cases of fluid accumulation, other types of pain should be treated with Wujisuan or Wuyao Shunqi Decoction, or Juanbi Decoction. Blood deficiency can also cause arm pain, as inadequate blood nourishes the muscles; for this, use a combination of Juanbi Decoction and Four Substance Decoction. Nursing mothers who rest their arms on their children might experience arm pain due to wind and cold; they should also refer to this treatment. If pain arises from wind and dampness while sitting or lying down, or if the arm is exposed to cold while sleeping, Wujin Decoction, Juanbi Decoction, and Wuyao Shunqi Decoction are recommended. If dampness is confirmed, for Juanbi Decoction, add three qian of cangzhu and four fen of fangji; or use Wubing Decoction. If pain resulted from a previous heavy lifting injury, apply Hu Po San, Jie Rong San, or Heqi Decoction, and add half a qian of fresh turmeric to benefit the arm.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Athlete&#39;s Foot</strong></p>
<p>Wind, cold, heat, and dampness, commonly encountered by the feet, lead to athlete&#39;s foot. Various pathogenic factors, whether they have been present for a long time or recently, and regardless of which meridian they belong to, can be treated with a herbal decoction to eliminate dampness, adding half a tael each of papaya, betel nut, and white atractylodes. Alternatively, one can use a powder of hydrangea and angelica, adding half a tael each of red peony and aroid. It is also advisable to take papaya pills regularly. </p>
<p>When athlete&#39;s foot flares up and causes unbearable pain in both feet, use the Five Accumulations Powder, adding three to five whole scorpions, and decoct in wine. During a flare-up, one will also experience body aches and fever; therefore, do not recklessly use cold medicine, as athlete&#39;s foot may resemble mild cold illnesses. If one suddenly feels weakness in the foot, numbness in the lower abdomen, cramps in the entire body, nausea or vomiting after eating, or redness and swelling in both shins, treat it as athlete&#39;s foot.</p>
<p>For dry symptoms, either of the previous two herbal formulations may have half a tael of stir-fried and crushed radish seeds added. For wet symptoms, add ten or more strips of green tangerine peel to the previous two medications. Remember, athlete&#39;s foot must not be treated with cold treatments; nor should cold medicines be used indiscriminately, as warmth is needed to disperse the condition.</p>
<p>With athlete&#39;s foot, one may observe a puncture approximately half an inch deep; every half day, pain may be distinctly abnormal. This indicates that athlete&#39;s foot has formed a discharge.

<p><strong>Dominion of the Limbs</strong></p>
<p>Yang governs the limbs. The classics say: &quot;The limbs are the root of all Yang.&quot; They also state that Yang receives Qi from the limbs. When Yang is sufficient, the limbs swell. The classic states: &quot;Accumulated Yang swelling in the limbs is this.&quot; When Yang is deficient, the limbs feel full. The classic states: &quot;Winter Qi disease in the limbs is this.&quot;</p>
<p>The spleen governs the limbs. The classic states: &quot;All limbs receive qi from the stomach but cannot reach the channels; this must be due to the spleen for them to receive it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Inability to Lift or Use</strong></p>
<p>When the spleen is full, the limbs are unable to lift. The classic states: &quot;When the spleen pulse is excessive, the disease manifests externally, causing one to be unable to lift the limbs.&quot; When the spleen is deficient, the limbs are unusable. The classic states: &quot;When the spleen&#39;s flesh form is insufficient, then the limbs are unusable.&quot; Furthermore, when the limbs lack energy, this is due to the spleen&#39;s essence not circulating. </p>
<p>In movement and qi, if the limbs are unable to lift, it all pertains to dampness. The classic states: &quot;When earth is excessive, it is said to be dense and mounded. The manifestations of this are abdominal fullness and inability to lift the limbs.&quot;</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the five organs have pathogens, they linger in the joints. The texts state: if the lungs or the heart have pathogens, their energy resides in the elbows; if the liver has pathogens, its energy is in the thighs; if the spleen has pathogens, its energy stays in the hips; and if the kidneys have pathogens, their energy is in the knees.</p>
<p>Regarding leg swelling:</p>
<p>When there is swelling in the legs, accompanied by urinary obstruction, a feeling of fullness and discomfort in the chest, and digestive issues, it is advisable to use mild diuretics. Leg swelling often relates to excess lung Qi. The texts say that when someone has lung disease, there will be sweating, along with issues in the lower back, thighs, knees, and feet. Hence, the method of expulsion used by practitioners to treat leg swelling is based on this principle. Additionally, in the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions,&quot; those with excessive sweating should also adopt methods to drain the lungs.</p>
<p>There are 124 types of wind and 80 types of Qi, but when it comes to leg swelling, one must ensure medication is consistently used, while other treatments may vary according to the condition. Those who have wind Qi should expel it through proper channels in late spring, early summer, and late autumn to avoid severe complications. The term &quot;expelling&quot; refers to herbs like Ephedra, Qian Niu Zi, and loquat seeds; bitter cold diuretics are not necessarily required.</p>
<p>East Yuan&#39;s discussion on southern leg swelling indicates that it&#39;s caused by external invasion of dampness and should be treated with cold remedies, whereas northern leg swelling, stemming from internal injuries caused by alcoholic beverages, should be treated for damp-heat. This is something that previous authors have not fully expounded upon. In my view, it isn&#39;t necessary to differentiate between north and south for cold and heat. Any external invasion of cold and dampness should be regarded as cold-damp, regardless of geography. Similarly, any internal injury from alcoholic beverages is related to damp-heat, regardless of the region. Treatment should rely on pulse diagnosis and inquiry about the patient&#39;s condition.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The texts from &quot;Wai Tai&quot; and &quot;Zong Lu&quot; state that the southern regions, characterized by their low, damp, misty, and dewy environments, lead to the people&#39;s skin being thin and weak, resulting in the inability of the Yang energy to be firmly expressed. Consequently, when they tread on the ground, the dampness envelops their emptiness and illness arises from below. This is due to a deficiency of blood and weak Qi, as they suffer from the evil influence of the dampness, which interacts with the blood at the skin level. When the evil is strong and the righteous Qi is insufficient, blood and Qi become stagnant; stagnation causes blockage, and weakness leads to further deterioration, thus giving rise to what later generations termed &quot;barley disease&quot; (or beriberi).</p>
<p>The &quot;Needling Classics&quot; states: since ancient times, there has been a method to eliminate these conditions, predominantly treating such ailments with moxibustion to drive out the dampness. In addition, consuming fermented beverages helps to regulate the channels and disperse the evil influences. Recipes were primarily constructed with more warming herbs than cold ones, using ingredients like ephedra, processed aconite, ginger, and prepared aconitum. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; asserts that excess dampness from the exterior should be expelled with bitter herbs. Ephedra, being bitter and warm, serves this purpose. Processed aconite is pungent and hot, aiding in mobility but lacking the ability to retain, thus facilitating the flow through the meridians. Ginger and prepared aconitum are pungent, sweet, and intensely warming, supportive of Yang energy while expelling the Yin, effectively dispelling the bad Qi of dampness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one should examine the three Yin and three Yang points in the feet to ascertain which meridians are involved, focusing on the medicinal treatments accordingly. It is essential to consider which of the six energies is relevant, and treat accordingly with supportive and guiding herbs. Master Sun said: &quot;The intent of the physician is key.&quot; Adjustments should be made according to circumstances, as there are no fixed prescriptions. Truly wise words indeed.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

If the pain is in the back part, it pertains to the Taiyang meridian, treated with Gao Ben and Qiang Huo. If the pain is on the outer side, it pertains to the Shaoyang meridian, treated with Chai Hu. If the pain is on the inner side, it pertains to the Jueyin meridian, treated with Chai Hu and Qing Pi. If the pain is in the inner front, it refers to the Taiyin meridian, treated with Sheng Ma, Bai Zhi, and scallions. If the pain is in the inner back, it pertains to the Shaoyin meridian, treated with Xi Xin and Du Huo.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Li Zhan]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Beriberi</strong>  </p>
<p>The term &quot;beriberi&quot; refers to the phenomenon when the four environmental factors of wind, cold, heat, and dampness affect the feet, penetrating deeply through the meridians into the internal organs. The onset is gradual, unlike the four environmental factors confronting a person where the symptoms can be sudden and superficial. The external symptoms resemble those of a cold, with the possibility of transformation through the six meridians, such as a headache and fever resembling the Taiyang syndrome, progressing to the Jueyin syndrome of agitation and contraction, potentially leading to concurrent diseases.</p>
<p>Initially, there may be weakness in the feet and knees, with persistent stiffness and cramps, accompanied by redness and swelling as distinguishing features. In cases of Taiyang syndrome where pain radiates from the outer ankle along the meridians to the outer side of the little toe, one should follow the prevalent environmental factors for dispersal, using a formula such as Ma Huang Decoction, adding Feng Feng, Qiang Huo, Xi Xin, Ge Gen, Bai Zhu, and Fu Ling, or Bai Du San combined with Ping Su San.</p>
<p>For Yangming syndrome presenting with pain from the outer thigh and knee descending to the inner side of the middle toe, the treatment involves addressing the predominance of environmental factors, using Da Chai Hu Decoction with added Qiang Huo, Xi Xin, and Xing Ren, or Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction combined with Ping Su San. </p>
<p>For Shaoyang syndrome showing pain in the joints of the toes, one should harmonize using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, omitting Feng Feng, Ge Gen, Xi Xin, Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Mai Men Dong, Gan Jiang, and include Xiao Cao. </p>
<p>For cases where three Yang syndromes manifest together in cramps and constipation, adjustments can be made to the previous formulas, named Zuo Jing Decoction. Alternatively, for those specifically affecting the foot Taiyin meridian, if pain or swelling is observed on the inner side of the foot&#39;s big toe or inner knee, one should use Guo Gui Fu Decoction with added Fang Ji, Bai Zhu, and Fu Ling.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

Symptoms resemble cold and heat types of typhoid, but at first, there is sudden foot pain, which may transform over weeks into something different. In cases of dampness, the tendons and vessels become relaxed, elongated, and soft, possibly causing swelling or sores, referred to as &quot;damp foot disease,&quot; which should be treated with methods to drain dampness and dispel wind. Dryness indicates heat. In dry conditions, tendons and vessels contract sharply, lacking swelling, referred to as &quot;dry foot disease,&quot; and should be treated by nourishing blood and clearing dryness.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Internal and External Causes</strong></p>
<p>The internal cause is a fondness for rich food, dairy, and fine wine, creating damp heat that flows downward to the liver and kidneys. Coupled with excessive sexual activity, even the wealthy may suffer from foot ailments. The external cause arises from prolonged sitting or standing in moist environments, exposure to pests in mountainous streams, or the damp heat of summer affecting the limbs. In winter, the exposure to damp cold can lead to chilling effects. Additionally, cooling oneself in the wind, sweating, and entering a bedroom after drinking may contribute to these conditions. External issues result in swelling and pain in the lower legs, while internal damage may reach the joints and occasionally affect the whole body. At first, observe the source of the issue, and use garlic moxibustion at that point, which is quite effective. </p>
<p>When dampness is predominant, swelling occurs; use a diuretic soup with areca nut and lignum isatis. For swollen legs, utilize a red flower and root pill, and for overweight individuals, add phlegm-relieving herbs. If there is severe redness, swelling, and pain, grind euphorbia into a powder, mix with water to apply at the swollen area, and additionally take licorice decoction for immediate relief, or use a decoction for blood detoxification with rhizoma atractylodis and rhubarb, and phytotherapy for wind to smooth the qi. </p>
<p>When dampness is combined with cold, pain can occur; use Wu Ji San, Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San, Fu Zi Liu Wu Tang, or Sheng Jun Wan. </p>
<p>When dampness is combined with wind, there can be irregular pains; utilize Wu Yao Shun Qi San or Di Xian Dan; for more severe cases, use a mixture of red peony and chinaberry in equal parts, make into pills with wine for expulsion; if blood stasis is present, use Fu Yuan Tong Sheng San combined with Xiao Feng San. </p>
<p>When dampness is combined with heat, swelling and pain are severe; use modified Cang Zhu San, Er Chao Cang Zhu San, or Qing Zao Tang. </p>
<p>For food accumulation with damp phlegm descending, use areca nut and Cang Zhu pills.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sweating of Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>In cases of typhoid fever, when the body fluids from the stomach channel reach the exterior, sweating will occur in the hands and feet. If heat attacks the stomach channel causing fluid to be forced out, there will be accompanying symptoms such as dry feces and signs associated with the Yangming channel. If the stool is initially hard, the treatment should be Da Chaihu Decoction or Da Chengqi Decoction; if the stool is not hard but soft, Xiao Chaihu Decoction should be used. In all instances of typhoid fever where one wishes to purge, if urination is scant, and the palms, feet, and armpits are not moisturized, one must avoid purgation. If there is a cold accumulation in the stomach channel with initial hard stool followed by diarrhea, or if food and drink are not being properly digested, and sweating occurs, one should not purge but rather administer a small dose of Lizhong Decoction or Zhu Ling Decoction. If there is severe cold, a lack of appetite, and difficulty urinating, this may indicate the onset of a chronic condition, and treatment should include Lizhong Decoction along with medicine to disperse Qi.</p>
<p><strong>Twitching of the Limbs</strong></p>
<p>The limbs are the foundational Yang; the waist and back are the conduits of the Taiyang. Due to sweating causing the pores to become loose, if rest is insufficient, wind pathogens may re-enter the muscles and bones, leading to contraction and difficulty in movement. For this, Niubang Root Decoction is indicated. If there is twitching and grinding of the teeth, this indicates wind-heat, warranting the use of Chengqi Decoction. In cases where limbs are rigid and unable to move freely, with difficulty in bending and stretching, and the posture resembles curling up to avoid wind, this is due to excessive sweating and loss of Yang. If sweating is profuse and urination is difficult, Gui Zhi Decoction with added Fu Zi should be used. After vomiting and purging, if there is reversed cold and rigidity, Si Ni Decoction is indicated. If there is heart vexation accompanied by limb spasms due to blood deficiency, Shaoyao Gancao Decoction should be applied. For conditions where both Yin and Yang are compromised, and there are spasms in the hands and feet resembling wind symptoms, Guazhu Decoction is appropriate.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jiaju</strong> refers to a condition where toxic gas attacks the fingers and toes, causing the flesh to swell around the nails, leading to pain and bleeding, with worms in the sores. This can be due to injuring the skin when removing nails or the nails growing into the flesh, resulting in swelling and pain. For treatment, use five taels of green vitriol, place it on an iron plate, cover it with charcoal fire, and blow to make the fire hot, allowing the vitriol to melt and release red juice. Wait until the juice is gone, remove from the fire, let it cool, and grind it into powder that resembles yellow earth. First, wash with salted water, then apply the green vitriol as the main ingredient, mixed with a small amount of frankincense as a paste. For more severe cases, use five qian of green vitriol, one and a half qian of aloe, and a small amount of musk to make a powder. Place the affected finger in a silk bag containing the medicine, tie it securely, and keep it until healed.</p>
<p><strong>Dai Zhi</strong> refers to an initial swelling of the fingertip, accompanied by heat and intense pain, which then results in pus forming at the edge of the nail. In severe cases, the entire nail may fall off. Begin treatment by using a solution of Glauber&#39;s salt to wash the area, then prepare a paste using the kernel of a black plum mixed with rice vinegar, soaking the finger to heal itself. Alternatively, one can use pig fat mixed with crushed earthworms for application.</p>
<p><strong>Tian She Tou</strong> refers to sores that develop on the fingers or toes. If there is swelling and pain near the sore, soak the roots of a chicken mother poplar in vinegar overnight for relief. Alternatively, place realgar inside a chicken egg and soak the affected finger in it overnight. The next morning, burn a centipede and use the smoke to fumigate the injured finger one or two times to achieve healing. If there is severe pain and continuous bleeding, prepare a powder from realgar, centipede, and scorpion, applying it directly on the sore, then cover it with a cloth smeared with a bit of oil.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h2>Ulcer</h2>
<p>This ulcer develops in the two areas above, initially manifesting as swelling and pain. In cases of cold and heat, it is attributed to external pathogens of damp heat, treated with Pinellia Powder or Detoxifying Powder; if the toxicity is severe with cold and heat, use Lifesaving Drink. If there is diffuse swelling and pain, or if there is no swelling or pain, this pertains to the deficiency of the three Yin; if there are occurrences of cold and heat, both Eight-Treasure Decoction and Ten-Full Great Supplement Decoction are advisable. If there is spleen deficiency combined with exterior pathogens, use the Qi-Boosting Decoction with added Platycodon and Angelica dahurica. For spleen deficiency with damp heat leading to pus, along with dry mouth and poor appetite, use the Qi-Boosting Decoction with added Poria and Peony. For evening heat, add stir-fried black Coptis and cooked Rehmannia. If anger is present, add Gardenia and Chuanxiong. If there is stagnation, use Spleen-Returning Decoction with added Gardenia and Bupleurum. If the affected area appears dark and cold with a weak appetite, this signifies liver and kidney deficiency; Eight-Ingredient Pill is appropriate. For internal heat and dry mouth, use Kidney Qi Pill. If it does not heal for a long time, use Bitter-Sweet Herb Pill. For kidney wind deficiency, use Four-Birth Powder or Astragalus Pill. </p>
<h2>External Treatment Method:</h2>
<p>For wind heat, wash with scallion soup and then apply dragon bone ointment. For wind heat, use Horsetail Ointment. For damp heat, use kiln soil ointment. If due to blood and qi stagnation, add a little frankincense to Xiao Zhu Che Wan. </p>
<p>At the initial stage of the internal ulcer, wash with salt water, then apply wax alum paper. For severe cases, use tung oil ointment; for intense itching, use Qianai Ointment. If it has not healed for a long time, utilize both internal and external use of ash ointment to eliminate necrotic tissue, followed by applying yellow wax ointment. However, internally, medication must be dosed appropriately; if mistakenly using aggressive treatments that harm the stomach, it can also cause injury.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Heel Ulcer</h3>
<p>The heel is the source of the Governing Vessel and the pathway of the Kidney. Internally, it arises from eating habits and daily activities that weaken the Three Yin of the foot, or it can be caused by bites from dogs or rabbits. For symptoms of swelling and decreased appetite, use the Ba Zhen Tang. For heat in the evening and dizziness, use Xiao Yao San or Shen Qi Wan. For coughing and phlegm, use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang or Ba Wei Wan. If left untreated, it could drain energy and blood leading to death.</p>
<h3>Calf Ulcer</h3>
<p>An ulcer on the calf starts small like a grain and gradually enlarges; incessant scratching causes it to form patches that overlap, with yellow fluid flowing out and unbearable itching, eventually becoming a chronic illness difficult to heal. Start by washing with a decoction of Guanzhong, then apply a powder made from various herbs mixed with saliva, spreading it from the outside in.</p>
<h3>Cuff Ulcer</h3>
<p>Cuff ulcers occur on the shins, sometimes caused by impact from objects. The ulcer has a narrow opening but is wide beneath the skin, which is thin like bamboo film, causing extreme itching and pain, with yellow fluid streaming all day. They can persist for decades and are easily transmissible. Patients should abstain from sexual activity for easier recovery. A mixture of chives and earthworm dung can be used, combined with light powder and clear oil or blood from a white dog for application. Internal and external ulcers can also be treated.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

<p>For conditions involving damp heat descending, first use garlic moxibustion and the Vitality Drink to resolve toxin accumulation, then administer the Middle-Supplementing Qi Decoction and Kidney Qi Pills to replenish essence and qi. In cases of three yin deficiency, initially apply the Detoxifying Powder to relieve toxins, or the Detoxifying Powder plus achyranthes, betel nut, eucommia, or the Detoxifying Powder itself. After ulceration, use the Great Wind-dispelling Decoction, the Ten Complete Replenishing Decoction, or the Eight Flavor Pills. If there is heat in the foot soles due to yin deficiency, use the Four Substance Decoction with added anemarrhena and phellodendron. For spleen deficiency, use the Middle-Supplementing Qi Decoction. If the treatment focuses specifically on ulcers, it can be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Ingrown Toenail</strong></p>
<p>An ingrown toenail occurs when a narrow shoe causes pressure, leading to the nail embedding into the flesh, with swelling on all sides, yellow fluid discharge, and the skin becoming soft and rotten, gradually extending up the foot, leading to blisters rising like boiling water, increasing day and night, making movement impossible. Use a strong decoction of dried tangerine peel for soaking for a long time until the flesh and nail separate, then gently trim the ingrown nail part; externally apply a burnt snake skin powder mixed with four qian of realgar, and apply it dry. For those with dry nails, mix it with fragrant oil for topical application. Treat it alongside nail-related conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Toe Nail Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Toe nail ulcers occur when the sharp nail pierces the flesh, causing painful ulcers to become moist and rotten.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Footback Sores</strong></p>
<p>Footback sores, also known as ulcerative sores, are named for their ability to rupture and discharge. They can also occur on the back of the hands and fingers. The cause is attributed to a diet of rich and heavy foods, which harms the spleen and kidneys. Symptoms may present as initial thirst before sores develop, or sores may appear first and then be followed by thirst. In mild cases, the sores appear red and painful, and can be treated. One should first use garlic moxibustion, and internally take revitalizing decoctions or detoxifying powders with added honeysuckle, angelica dahurica, and rhubarb. Once the pain subsides, one can use the Conclusion Powder, or take the internal Exuberance Powder with celestial flower powder and honeysuckle. For those with stagnant qi, the Sixteen Ingredient Flowing Qi Decoction is recommended. For those with deficiency below, the Complete Nourishment Decoction, Eight Ingredient Pill, or Large Bitter Orchid Pill may be used.</p>
<p>In more severe cases, the sores are dark in color and not painful. Initially apply garlic moxibustion and mulberry twig moxibustion, while taking tonic medicines to strengthen internally. This prevents the necrotic flesh from encroaching, increasing chances of survival. Additionally, injuries from biting or scratches might lead to sores which do not rupture or hurt, but extend in dark color. Such cases also pose a risk of severe complications. In critical situations, one must use a sharp knife to remove the affected tendons, allowing the poison to disperse. If the issue is located on a finger, the finger must be amputated; if on flesh, the affected flesh must be excised. For external treatment, use castor oil and unnamed herbs, boil together, then add a spoonful of Sichuan pepper. Depending on the size of the wound, slice perilla leaves and boil them together. After soaking, apply these leaves directly onto the wound to ensure comfort.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

<p>The pulse of beriberi has four patterns: a floating and wiry pulse indicates wind, and sweating is appropriate; a moist and weak pulse indicates dampness, and draining is suitable; a slow and thick pulse due to cold indicates warming is needed; a surging and rapid pulse indicates heat, and purging is advisable.

A pulse that is constricted indicates concern, scattered indicates worry, tight indicates anger, and thin indicates sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Ulcers arise due to kidney deficiency and cold, with wind and toxic qi attacking from outside, affecting the sides of the lower abdomen. Wind-heat and toxic qi flow to the feet, causing ulcers that ooze and rot, accompanied by pain and foul odor, making walking difficult. These ulcers located on the hip bones are severe, as there is little flesh and thin skin over the bones, making healing difficult. Some may persist for many years with wide-open sores, rotten skin exposing flesh, producing an odorous and repulsive condition. The treatment should focus first on removing worms, followed by topical application; internal medications like wax and alum are also advisable. It is essential to sit with legs elevated and to avoid excessive walking, which may facilitate complete healing.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Foot Qi Cold Type</strong></p>
<p>Foot Qi occurs when the feet are affected by cold and dampness, leading to headache, body heat, joint pain, constipation, and nausea. However, the pain may be localized to the feet, which can be swollen or shriveled, distinguishing it from typhoid. Xu Renze states: There are several types of this illness. One results from drinking cold water, which causes foot Qi, derived from the gradual accumulation of water vapor; another occurs when kidney energy is initially weak, and during the hot months, if cold water is used to wash the feet, the dampness does not disperse, resulting in foot Qi. Additionally, if kidney energy is already weak, imbalances due to a damp environment can lead to upward surging dampness, contributing to foot Qi. All these conditions can cause swollen ankles, heavy discomfort, and in severe cases, may even lead to discomfort in the heart and abdomen, making breathing short. There are also dry and wet types of foot Qi; the wet type has swollen feet, while the dry type shows no swelling but gradually feels dry, with skin issues that require careful observation. If one first feels stabbing pain in the chest or sides, along with fullness and discomfort in the chest and back, worsened after eating, accompanied by shortness of breath and heaviness in the limbs, with bone marrow pain and increased difficulty in breathing, especially after consuming greasy or spoiled foods, these are symptoms of foot Qi due to downward flowing dampness. If these symptoms are present, one should follow the appropriate treatment. If there is a progression of water vapor, remedies like Xixin decoction with eight herbs and Tianmizi pills can be used. If there are no prior symptoms but there is a sensation of swollen, aching, heavy, and dull feet, sometimes accompanied by acute pain or numbness in the lower abdomen, one should adhere to prescriptions like Wuzhuyu decoction with five ingredients and Sanggenbaipei pills with six ingredients, along with Zhezi liquor containing ten ingredients, to take carefully.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that the hands and feet are the extremities of the stomach and spleen. When there is heat in the spleen and stomach, the hands and feet will certainly be hot; when there is cold in the spleen and stomach, the hands and feet will certainly be cold—this is the common principle. However, in cases of a cold attack, there can be a deep cold and deep heat, or slight cold and slight heat. Why is this? It is said: If the stomach is cold, the hands and feet are cold; if the stomach is hot, the hands and feet are hot—this is the regular pattern of disease. However, extreme conditions can change things, so one should not be bound by ordinary reasoning. Excess leads to harm, and the response counters it. When fire energy is excessive, it can also involve water transformation, thus producing this phenomenon. Yin and yang alternate; the reversals of disease cannot be understood by regular theories. Phrases like &quot;cold extremities,&quot; &quot;cold limbs,&quot; or &quot;hands and feet cold&quot; are all expressions of variation and should not be analyzed lightly. </p>
<p>If we speak of the four limbs, there could be differences, and it cannot be solely attributed to a cold condition. If cold in the extremities reaches above the arms and below the knees, it is undoubtedly true cold, and one must urgently use warming medicines like ginger. If it is neglected for long, it becomes difficult to treat. This cold surpasses the elbows and knees; how could there be true cold within that extends to the limbs? However, one should also consider the pulse alongside the accompanying symptoms to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>In examining cold attacks, one cannot simply conclude it is cold due to a reversal; one must correlate with pulse findings to understand the situation accurately. For instance, if the hands and feet feel reversed along with abdominal pain, fullness, diarrhea with clear discharge, and clear urination, while there is no thirst and the person feels chills and trembling with a pale face, these all indicate a cold condition. Conversely, if there is abdominal pain with heaviness, diarrhea that is thick and sticky, dark urination, and thirst with a desire to drink, these all indicate a heat condition. Careful scrutiny is required.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Leg Heat and Pain</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Below the knees, the legs sometimes feel internal heat, or there is a sensation of heat in the bones, or there may be slight soreness with heat. What is the cause of this?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> This is due to blood heat. In cases of wind disease, the blood must be hot. When the blood is hot, if the cold air from wind and cold invades, it binds the internal heat and causes pain. Danxi discussed gout, stating that blood heat meets cold, leading to filth and stagnation, which results in pain. Pain is worse at night, as it occurs in the yin phase; it also intensifies with wind, rain, and cold, indicating severe cold and dampness. Furthermore, in wind disease, the blood must be dry, as wind and wood generate fire, thus resulting in hot and dry blood.  </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mr. Chen from Linchuan states that to treat wind illness, one must first treat the blood; if the blood circulates, the wind will automatically dispel. The liver stores blood and governs wind. The liver qi represents yang and fire, while liver blood represents yin and water. If the liver fire is strong, the liver blood must be deficient. Therefore, for all wind diseases, many arise from the liver channels being troubled by wind and fire, necessitating enhancement of blood through the interaction and support of the five organs. The texts state: the kidneys store essence and govern bones; thus, if the kidneys are deficient, there will be heat in the bones. If there is internal heat in the Yongquan point of the lower legs and feet, one is often afflicted with bone atrophy to the point of being unable to rise, which pertains to the deficiency heat of the three yin of the feet. Nourishing its source of essence may help preserve life.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Luò jū (Dislocation Ulcer)</strong></p>
<p>Dislocation ulcer refers to sores that develop on the toes or, if the foot is ulcerated, the white skin falls off; hence the name. There are also those that appear on the fingers, referred to as &quot;worm-eaten joint sores.&quot; In severe cases, the entire joint may decay; in mild cases, there may just be cramps in the tendons. For painful sores, dampness should be removed and toxins attacked, with a garlic poultice applied until no pain remains. </p>
<p>Whether the pain is severe or absent, the garlic poultice can still be used, along with detoxification medicines. If the color is black, immediate amputation is necessary, and rapid consumption of tonics is advised to save the patient. If the blackness extends upwards, it is untreatable. If the color is red and painful, one should clear away the toxins thoroughly and apply more cauterization. </p>
<p>In cases of thirst, nourishing yin and lowering fire is recommended. If the color is black, it is untreatable. This condition arises from excessive consumption of rich foods, wine, and cooked greasy substances that accumulate toxins. Sometimes it results from careless sexual activity leading to depletion of kidney water, or from improper consumption of medicinal stones that can cause thirst before illness or illness before thirst. Both occur because the kidney water is insufficient to control fire. </p>
<p>If the initial appearance is black, it cannot be treated. If red, it indicates that the water is not yet depleted and is still manageable. However, should toxins persist and lead to necrosis resulting in blackening, urgent amputation is necessary; delaying will worsen the condition, leading to death. This ailment is not contingent on swelling or ulceration, but only effective treatment is through garlic poultice. There are also cases where red sores become painful and self-ulcerate; the vital energy remains intact, making it easier to treat. </p>
<p>Due to the extreme cold beneath the skin, blood and qi have difficulty reaching that area, making the infected flesh prone to decay, while medicinal properties struggle to penetrate. Moreover, the treatments used are often those that attack pain, which may affect the intestines and stomach first, failing to target the poison effectively. Therefore, a garlic poultice combined with amputation is the best method. Thus, Master Sun stated, &quot;If on a finger, cut it off; if on flesh, amputate,&quot; reflecting this principle.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of gangrene arises from consuming strong alcohol and excessive rich foods, which harm the spleen, or from sexual overexertion that damages the kidneys. Therefore, there are cases where thirst appears first followed by illness, and others where illness manifests before thirst. If the color is red and there is pain with ulceration, it can be treated. If the color is black and there is no ulceration, it should not be treated. In cases of red color and pain, the vital energy is weak and damp toxins are abundant; first, use garlic moxibustion, the Lingming Decoction, and the Tuoli Powder, then follow with the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction and the modified Eight Flavor Pill. If the color is dark and there is no pain, it indicates kidney energy failure and excessive virtual fire; garlic moxibustion and mulberry branch moxibustion should be utilized, along with the Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction and the modified Eight Flavor Pill, to prevent the toxic qi from rising and the vital energy from depleting, thereby preserving life. There are cases resulting from injuries such as bites on the hands and feet. If the vital energy is weak, or from sexual activity, applying cold externally and using medicinal herbs internally can harm the spleen and stomach, resulting in non-ulcerated lesions. If the dark area extends upwards, it can often be fatal. In severe cases, one must use a foot knife to cut around the area and gently pull it away; thus, the tendons follow the bones out, allowing the poison to be released without pain. Otherwise, the poisonous tendons may rupture internally, leading to ulcers despite removal.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I will approach the diagnosis according to the situation. Generally, although this condition may present with varying degrees of swelling and severity, all instances arise from a deficiency of true qi, allowing the pathogenic influence to deeply invade. Therefore, conditions like bone sores and &quot;crane knee wind,&quot; are often seen in those with kidney deficiency. Ancients used aconite to warm and tonify kidney qi, while also facilitating the dispersal of cold evils. There are also individuals with weak constitutions who, sleeping in the open during summer and autumn, are attacked by cold air, leading to accumulation of cold and heat, which often results in this condition, causing inability to move, occasional heat without sweating, and pain upon pressure that radiates to the bones. If this does not resolve over time, extreme yin generates yang, cold transforms into heat, and leads to pus formation. If one is struck by a wind that is not particularly hot but results in chills and occasional sweating, applying heat may alleviate the pain slightly. In such cases, one must urgently treat with formulas like &quot;Wind-dispelling Decoction&quot; or &quot;Fire Dragon Ointment.&quot; There are also cases of contraction and atrophy, with hardness like stone, referred to as stone sore; if the condition lingers without resolution, with red-purple color and decay of flesh, it is known as gradual sore.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The principle of establishing the proper treatment has its own suitability. When the body is weak and the evil binds the bones, obstructing the channels, unless one uses warm herbs like Aconite to dispel the cold evil in the joints and open the pathways of qi and blood, recovery is impossible. Moreover, the &quot;Materia Medica&quot; states that Aconite treats cold-dampness, weakness, contractions, knee pain, and inability to walk, and when combined with Atractylodes, it becomes a sacred remedy for cold-dampness. It also mentions that cinnamon opens the blood channels, resolves stagnation, strengthens the bones and joints, and treats wind-damp conditions and weakness of the feet. </p>
<p>When using various prescriptions and the Comprehensive Tonifying Decoction for the aforementioned conditions, it is not only inappropriate to exclude cinnamon but also to not include Aconite. Without these two, how can the effects of ginseng and astragalus, or the properties of angelica and hawthorn, assist in nourishing blood and qi, ensuring the channels are unobstructed, and supporting substantial deficiencies to achieve desired therapeutic results? Furthermore, since the ailments are located between the joints and in key areas, delaying treatment leads to stagnation of qi and blood, resulting in pus formation which, once discharged, leaves the body devoid of any nourishing principle.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Ulcer</h3>
<p>Ulcers arise on both lower legs. Initially, they appear red and swollen, and over time may become necrotic, or lead to itching and oozing pus. This is due to dietary habits and lifestyle depleting the liver and kidneys, or due to Yin fire flowing downwards and external pathogens clashing. External ulcers are associated with damp-heat in the yang channels of the foot and can be treated; internal ulcers correspond to deficiency-heat in the yin channels of the foot and are harder to cure. </p>
<p>If initial symptoms include chills, high fever, and painful swelling, this indicates damp-heat, and the prescription should be Ping Su Bai Du San. If there is diffuse swelling and pain, or no swelling and pain, this indicates yin deficiency, for which the remedy is Ba Zhen Tang to tonify yin. If there is purulent oozing, bodily fatigue, and poor appetite, with internal heat and dry mouth, this indicates spleen deficiency, and the treatment is to use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with add-ins of Fu Ling and wine-fried Bai Shao. If there is afternoon heat, potential pain, and unclear head, this indicates yin fire; the prescription should be the above formula with the additions of wine-fried Huang Bai and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>If fever occurs in the afternoon and subsides only at midnight, this indicates blood deficiency, and the treatment should add Chuan Xiong, Gui, and Shu Di to the previous formula. If there is severe depression damaging the spleen, use Gui Pi Tang with additions of Chai Hu and Shan Zhi. If anger has stirred up liver fire greatly, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with additional Chuan Xiong, Shan Zhi, and Huang Qin. For internal heat and dry mouth, bodily fatigue, possibly with phlegm rising or sores on the mouth and tongue, this signifies spleen deficiency heat, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. </p>
<p>If the affected area is dark, limbs are sensitive to cold, and there is little desire for food, this points to spleen and kidney deficiency, for which Ba Wei Wan is appropriate. If one aggressively attacks with treatment, it further damages stomach qi, severing its source of transformation, making treatment very difficult. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heel is the origin of the Governing Vessel and the area through which the Kidney Meridian passes. If there are disturbances in diet and daily routine, leading to a deficiency in the three Yang Meridians of the foot, ulcers will form. If there is swelling with cold and heat, or if the body feels weary with little appetite, this indicates a deficiency in the Spleen and a sinking condition, which can be treated with the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction.&quot; If there is an evening fever with pain and a lack of clarity in the head and eyes, this indicates deficiency in the Spleen with rising Yin fire, for which the above decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Wan can be used. If phlegm rises, or if sores appear in the mouth and on the tongue, this indicates the drying up of Kidney water, which can be treated with the above decoction plus a modified version of the Eight Treasure Pill. In all these cases, one must nourish the source of transformation; merely treating the exterior will not suffice. It is commonly said that a wound caused by a rabbit&#39;s bite results from a hunter being bitten on the heel, leading to prolonged neglect, depletion of Qi and Blood, and ultimately death.</p>
<p>As for the condition of foot hair, it relates to the deficiency of essence and blood in the three Yin Meridians of the foot, or the downward attack of damp-heat in the three Yang Meridians. If it is red, swollen, painful, and has suppurative discharge, this is treatable and indicates moist heat descending. If it appears slightly red and swollen with clear pus, this indicates a deficiency of essence and blood, which is harder to treat. If the area is dark and does not swell or hurt, and if there is thirst with frequent, painful urination, this indicates a failure of Yin and is untreatable. For those with damp heat descending, one should initially use garlic moxibustion and the &quot;Huo Ming Yin&quot; to clear the obstruction of toxins, then administer the beneficial Qi decoction and Liuwei Wan to replenish essence and Qi. If the condition appears dark but not painful, one should employ meat moxibustion on the mulberry branches to move the obstruction and support Yang Qi; additionally, one should use the &quot;Shiquan Dabu Decoction&quot; and the Eight Treasure Pill to strengthen the Spleen and Stomach, nourishing the source of transformation, which often leads to regeneration. However, focusing solely on treating the ulcer might harm the original Qi, and I have not seen any successful recoveries from that approach.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

This is something that earlier scholars did not clarify, and later scholars became entrenched in it, leading to the formation of two factions in the south and north, mutually criticizing each other.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The texts &quot;Su&quot; and &quot;Ling,&quot; among others, explore the heavens above and the earth below, examining human affairs and their changes. The essence of the cosmos is nourished by the dual energies of heaven and earth, while humans offer reverence through the Six Classics, the Three Yin, and the Three Yang. Thus, the Three Yin and Three Yang correspond to the energies within human Six Classics. They nourish the organs and strengthen the spirit, facilitating the transformation of food and water into the sustenance of the body.</p>
<p>When the six energies of heaven and earth are improperly aligned, change occurs, leading to disturbances in the body&#39;s form, manifesting as illnesses referred to as external pathogens. Likewise, if a person’s Three Yin and Three Yang are out of balance, alterations may lead to conditions characterized by inappropriate fluids, identified as internal pathogens. Both situations can result in a myriad of illnesses throughout the body.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Six Classics of the feet originate from the five toes. Movement through the legs and knees is linked to the internal organs and governs the circulation of energy and blood below the body’s midpoint. Consequently, if external pathogens enter, they can obstruct the flow of these energies and block the circulation of blood.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one has an internal stagnation of pathogenic elements that becomes lodged, it is surely similar to the obstruction of qi and blood by external pathogens. The symptoms of congestion, pain, weakness, numbness, and counterflow are also alike. Hence, this condition is commonly referred to as &quot;foot qi,&quot; which is recognized across all regions. </p>
<p>Now, in the southern regions, there is an acknowledgment of the dampness from external pathogens, while the northern regions address the internal dampness from within. Is this not a misunderstanding? However, even if the northern regions lack the low-lying dampness of the earth, they are subject to moisture from rain and dew, as well as from sweat and footwear. All these contribute to dampness. When shoes are removed, and sweat combines with the wind, leading to blood coagulating in the feet, can this not be classified similarly to the external dampness of the southern regions?</p>
<p>Although the southern regions may not have the milk-like dampness, they do have moisture from food and drink that injures the organs and causes the accumulation of fluids. Does this not relate to the internal stagnation seen in the milk-like dampness of the northern regions? Understanding this principle is critical, yet one might fear the difficulty in discerning different pathogenic influences, leaving little time to cause harm to one another!</p>

Ginseng and licorice are sweet and warm, nourishing the spleen and supporting upright qi, preventing bitter herbs from harming the spleen and stomach. Zhang Zhongjing stated that when damp heat combines, it causes pain in the joints. Bitter herbs like kushen, huangqin, zhimu, and yinchen are cold and bitter, used to drain dampness. For the treatment of inadequate urination due to dampness, the typical method is not sufficient. Polyporus is sweet, warm, and balanced, while ze xie is salty and mild, helping to drain excess fluids and guiding stagnant fluid out, which is why they are used as assistants.

<p><strong>Tiger&#39;s Mouth Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The abscess at the tiger&#39;s mouth arises in the He Gu point.</p>
<p><strong>Snake Head Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The snake head abscess appears on both sides of the fingertip, resembling a snake&#39;s head, with a strong foul odor, dark purple color, and pain radiating to the heart, sometimes leading to ulceration and detachment.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Boil</strong></p>
<p>According to &quot;Gui Yi,&quot; when an arm droops, lesions appear near the bone on the lower arm, growing to the size of chicken or duck eggs, caused by disturbed nourishment and defense. It tends to remain solid but does not penetrate deeply; thus, it should be urgently resolved, or treated quickly at the site of onset. In both arms, sores appear below the elbow and above the small bone. Despite being solid, these can connect various tendons and muscles, leading to difficulty in movement, with pain in the drooping hand and a deep, penetrating pus that harms tendons and blood vessels, resulting in contracted fists and spasms. It is essential to treat with slow-acting tendon and vein remedies.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Yuan Ji,&quot; an abscess on the outer arm is a boil, on the inner arm indicative of a fish belly issue, and swelling around the joints implies arm wind toxin. It is advisable to take a life-saving decoction adding Qiang Huo, Du Huo, Gui Zhi, and Jie Geng, boiled with equal parts water and wine, as well as selecting from various elixirs like Du Ming Dan, Zi Jin Dan, and Sheng Jin Dan. For those robust with internal evidence, one pill of Jin Dan or Ba Zhen San should be given. If there is swelling without a head that resists detoxifying medicine, it is advisable to use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding Gui Zhi and Jie Geng to support it. If there is vomiting and no food intake for several days, the discharge of pus will lead to recovery.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Numbness and Boils (Commonly known as Disease of the Lotus Bundle)</strong></p>
<p>The arm, both inside and out, is swollen, painful, and red, except at the elbow joint, which is slightly smaller; hence it is called the lotus bundle, representing the division of yin and yang. Someone might ask about the Yangming meridian of the arm: it initially resembles millet, gradually grows to the size of a red bean, and becomes unbearably painful. Within ten days, it can swell to the size of a walnut and turn a withered purple color. What does this signify? It is called bone fistula sores. If the poison spreads throughout the body, causing rigidity, convulsions, vomiting, inability to eat, spontaneous cold sweat, diarrhea, irritability, and chaotic pulse, the person will die. Those who are influenced by excessive fatigue or anger will also die. </p>
<p>One person suffering from this condition, after a month, developed widespread lesions, vomited yellow fluid, filled the room with foul odors, and subsequently vomited pus and blood, leading to death within ten days. This individual had been eating and drinking just three or four days earlier; family members helped him wash and stand, but his skin and flesh had already rotted. The patient was in disbelief, and the doctors were unable to recognize the condition, leading to the demise. This is caused by the imbalance of emotions, accumulated anger, accumulated worries, and excessive heat, resulting in a depletion of true essence that cannot withstand the evil. Even with pills and elixirs, it is ultimately determined by fate. Only the wise can prevent disasters before they occur, urgently taking medicine such as Huanglian Xiaodu San, Shengjin Dan, Wujin San, and Huoming Yin with selected Qianghuo. Treating it hastily can lead to dire consequences; if there are multiple severe symptoms, death is certain. </p>
<p>This condition arises suddenly and leads to rapid death, indicating extreme yin deficiency and uncontrolled fire. Therefore, previous medicines do not nourish the source and merely stop the boiling; can this truly help?<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

Hand dorsum swellings are due to stagnation of wind and heat in the three Yang meridians. A restorative drink with added scutellaria, lamium, gardenia, platycodon root, and cimicifuga should be taken; add cinnamon twig for cold symptoms and turmeric for heat. For those with surface symptoms, use Zijing Dan, Wujin San, or Duoming Dan for sweating. For internal symptoms, a single golden pill or Bazhen San should be used.

It may be itchy or numb without pain, or can cause intense heart-wrenching pain; this is called &quot;regulating carbuncle&quot; and is associated with the hand Taiyin lung meridian accumulating toxins. If the toxins are severe, amputation is advised. If blood and pus are drawn after four days, the person will survive; if black blood is drawn, they will die. Urgently take Wujin powder or Zijing pill to induce sweating. For robust individuals, administer one gold pill.

<p><strong>Dai Zhi</strong></p>
<p>Dai Zhi begins with swelling, pain, and heat, presenting a non-dark color. Pus accumulates around the nail edges, and in severe cases, the nails may all fall off. It is best to apply a cold medicinal liquid to the affected area. The nails are the remnants of tendons; tendons rely on the nourishment of blood, and if the blood is overheated, it concentrates at the fingertip, causing swelling and accumulation of pus, resulting in nail loss. This condition resembles finger boils but lacks toxic accumulation, hence the color is not dark and, even if prolonged, is not lethal. </p>
<p>For internal treatment, the &quot;Sheng Ji Zong Lu&quot; contains formulas like Lou Lu Decoction and Lan Hua Decoction, which include Lou Lu, Lan Hua, Sheng Ma, Da Huang, Huang Qin, Yuan Shen, and (Shi Bu) Xie.

<p>Someone asked about swollen and painful knees and the gradual thinning of the thighs. The answer: This is called Crane Knee Wind, also known as Hammer Wind. It arises from internal dampness, or may occur after diarrhea when the legs are weak and painful, making it difficult to walk, termed Diarrhea Wind. It may also result from the residual toxins of a cold, failing to disperse, causing wind, cold, and dampness to obstruct the meridians, leading to stagnant blood flow, which results in muscle contraction and further thinning of the thighs, associated with the Lesser Yang and Yangming meridians of the leg. </p>
<p>It is advisable to use jade dragon ointment mixed with wine and apply it to the legs to alleviate pain and revive yang energy; also, apply a warming ointment to the ankles to promote the movement of qi and blood. Taking the Great Wind Dispelling Decoction or Dispelling Wind Pills, with an increased amount of myrrh, can help relieve pain and relax the muscles. Additionally, moxibustion with garlic is recommended. If it feels as hard as stone, rubbing with raw camphor root is effective.</p>
<p>If asked about pain and swelling on the knees, the response: This is not a simple matter and requires careful distinction. If both knees are swollen and painful, resembling a bite from a tiger, with alternating cold and heat, progressively thinning thighs, and increasingly swollen knees, it is called Crane Knee Wind. Immediate garlic moxibustion and the Great Wind Dispelling Decoction should be administered. </p>
<p>However, if one knee experiences pain that extends above and below, with slight swelling and redness, it is termed Knee Wander Wind, and it is advisable to take the Saintly Gift Pill, Bone Changing Pill, or Wind Dispelling and Open Spirit Powder with added achyranthes and papaya. If there is swelling and pain on both sides of the knee, with aversion to cold and an intense heat sensation, worsening day and night, and the swollen area should not be touched, it is termed Knee Eye Poison; swelling and pain on the knee itself is classified as Knee Abscess.

Within five to seven days, they break open, releasing dark blood and pus. This causes swelling and pain in the calf, along with cold, tight discomfort in the leg. This results from straining the muscles and qi due to overexertion. One should use decoctions and injections externally; the toxins will dissipate by themselves.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

It does not cause sharp pain, but it swells rapidly. There is concern about damage to the tendons, thus it is essential to expel the pus and toxins early to ensure safety.</p>
<p><strong>Green Snake Bowel Movement</strong></p>
<p>If asked about a lump below the calf, about two or three inches long, accompanied by great cold and heat, and inability to eat or drink, what should be done? It is called &quot;Green Snake Troubling.&quot; It relates to the Kidney Yin and the Foot Yangming meridians, resulting from deficiency of the Kidney causing damp heat to descend. If the head of the lump is pointed upwards, it is difficult to treat. If the head points downwards, one should extract the bad blood, and take medicinal drinks with papaya, cowherb, yellow bile, or selections of black gold powder and purple gold pill. For the old and weak, if they experience vomiting, abdominal distension, confusion, and rapid pulse, the outcome is fatal. </p>
<p>The &quot;Green Snake&quot; condition develops on the upper and lower parts of the calves; if the head points upwards and breaks into the abdomen, it cannot be treated. If the head points downwards and the tail is upwards, it is considered treatable. Urgent administration of a compound of twenty-six ingredients known as Tuo Li San is required, along with external application of the medicinal formula Shen Fang Tie Gu San, mixed with ginger juice, aged vinegar, and pig bile for dressing. For upward-facing conditions, use a three-edged needle on the snake&#39;s head, inserting it two inches to draw out dark purple blood. After removing the needle, immediately use Baosheng San, soaking a paper wick in the medicine and inserting it.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

If there is black pus, it is severe; if it hasn’t surpassed the period, it can be treated. When a sore grows on the toes, if it is severe, it festers and detaches, hence it is called Tuo Ju. Some say only the big toe suffers from Tuo Ju; other toes with similar issues are called Dun Ju, which is easier to treat. Only Tuo Ju is difficult to treat. When it first appears as a red, swollen, painful toxin, use Wu Shen San and apply crushed Zihua Che, Jin Xian Diao Hu Lu, Jin Ji She, and Jin Nao Xiang; also apply juice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jia Ju [Nail Disease]</strong></p>
<p>The three Yin meridians of the foot all originate at the toes. When the Qi and blood stagnate and do not flow, they can accumulate between the nails, leading to nail disease. This is due to the flow of the meridians and is not solely a problem of the muscles. It may arise from trimming the nails and injuring the underlying flesh, from nails growing into the flesh, or from improper footwear causing stagnation of Qi and blood, resulting in ulceration. If it persists, it can rot the fingers and extend up to the shins and knees, leading to sores and blisters. Since the disease occurs at the extremities, it is unnecessary to treat the internal organs; one should simply apply ointments to cleanse and remove foulness and fit the footwear properly for recovery. The toes are at the lowest part of the body, making it easy for Qi and blood to stagnate and difficult for medicinal effects to reach; weak individuals may develop sores from minor injuries that do not heal over time. In cases of severe injury, only through substantially tonifying the Qi and blood can recovery be expected. This notion of treating only the extremities is not universally applicable.</p>

<p>The text from &quot;Gui Yi&quot; states: Yang sores appear on the ankles and soles; if twenty days pass without improvement, it can be fatal. It may be punctured after ten days. If the sore is red and has white pus with not much blood, it is itchy and if black and red, it is fatal. The &quot;tufu&quot; refers to the top of the foot, where toxins can accumulate leading to swelling and pain; it is also called foot rashes and is connected to the liver channel of the foot Jueyin and the stomach channel of Yangming. It usually results from damp heat penetrating a weakness, and it is advisable to take a restorative drink adding papaya, cinnamon, and cow knee, along with moxibustion on garlic. This can be followed by a tonifying decoction or warming the middle. Thick pus can be treated, but if the pus is clear and purplish, it is fatal.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p></div>

<p>If someone asks about a carbuncle on the heel, what should be done? It is called &quot;rabbit bite&quot; because its shape resembles that of a rabbit&#39;s bite. It belongs to the Taiyang channel of the foot, with the point named Shenmai, located beneath the heel bone. This area is where the two extremes of yin and yang originate, resulting from accumulated heat in the organs. The toxicity is profound, and the use of toxic medicines externally is most to be avoided. Instead, one should perform moxibustion using garlic, and take the &quot;Reviving Life Decoction&quot; with added ox knee and cinnamon, or select from the &quot;Victory Gold Pill,&quot; &quot;Black Gold Powder,&quot; or &quot;Purple Gold Pill.&quot; If there is purple-black discoloration, numbness, confusion, or irregular pulses, it is not treatable. If it festers over time, it might hinder eating and drinking. Additionally, if the two excretions are unregulated, or if there has been excessive physical exertion or emotional agitation, it can lead to death.</p>
<p>For women experiencing swelling and pain in the heel and toes, along with heat in the soles of the feet, this is due to childbirth and menstruation, lacking appropriate care, leading to deficiency in the three yin of the foot and causing false heat. If there is swelling and pain or pus formation, use the Six Flavor Pill as the main treatment, supplemented with the Eight Treasures Decoction; if there is stomach deficiency and reluctance to eat, supplement with the Six Gentlemen Decoction; for cold and heat with inner heat, supplement with the Xiaoyao Powder; if afternoon heat increases, with unclear head and eyes, supplement with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If phlegm is excessive, causing thirst or sores in the mouth and tongue, also use the previous two medicines to nourish the source of digestion. Generally, symptoms of fever, afternoon heat, internal heat, spontaneous sweating, and night sweating indicate false heat due to yin deficiency. Therefore, Danxi states that fire arises from the nine springs, representing the extreme of yin deficiency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Gangrene</strong> </p>
<p>Gangrene is an external decay coupled with internal corruption. It arises from the long-term consumption of rich foods, which overheat the internal organs, as well as the use of mineral supplements that deplete kidney vitality. Excessive sexual exertion can also exhaust the Qi and damage essence. Additionally, the use of potent drugs held under the tongue to transform into liquid, which then reaches the lower abdomen, or directed into the navel to cause internal heat, can induce this condition. </p>
<p>Some seek to enhance virility through ointments applied to the groin or by stimulating the male organs, hoping to maintain vigor. This often results in the over-accumulation of Yang essence and rampant sexual fire, leading to heat and dryness within the organs, or poisoning that seeps into the bones, culminating in ulcers and severe sores. </p>
<p>Truly, it reflects the foolish actions of the clever, unheeded by those who fail to protect themselves from hidden misfortunes. The wise often delude themselves into believing good fortune has come, neglecting the degradation of their health, until they realize that their present ailments have a cause, but the remedy eludes them. </p>
<p>This affliction often manifests in the hands and feet, which are the extensions of the five vital organs. Initially, the sores appear as small as a grain of millet, accompanied by blisters resembling cooked jujubes, with dark energy spreading throughout. The pain is intense, like flames spilling forth, while the condition deteriorates to a point where bones weaken and sinews rot. The foul odor is unbearable, and the essence of life becomes elusive. </p>
<p>Thus, it is said that the heart fails due to blood loss, the liver fails due to the death of sinews, the spleen fails due to the decay of flesh, the lungs fail due to the death of skin, and the kidneys fail due to the demise of bones. In these five failures, even the most potent elixirs cannot save a life.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those who suffer from this illness, life and death should not be taken lightly. Master Sun said: When the illness is in the flesh, it should be cut; when it is in the finger, it should be sliced. This is indeed the nature of the disease. The treatment should be applied early, taking advantage of the time before it has spread. Use more than ten strands of hair to wrap tightly around the base of the affected finger for ten more turns, gradually tightening it, ensuring that the poisonous gas does not attack the healthy flesh. At the same time, use toad bile pastry, placing it on top of the original grain, and apply moxibustion until the flesh withers and the sore dies off. </p>
<p>The next day, if the finger turns completely black, then use a sharp knife to carefully cut along the seam of the affected joint, gently removing the finger. If the bleeding does not stop, use a gold knife like a holy remedy to stem it, and for any remaining swelling, apply a marvelous poultice. The following day, if there is still black vapor remaining, use only ground toad bile tablets mixed into a powder, cover with ointment, and the black vapor will recede. If pus develops at the site, use the regular method with jade red ointment and other medicines to protect the newly grown flesh and ensure the bone is intact, which is a favorable omen.</p>
<p>Internally, take medications to nourish kidney essence, support vital energy and blood, strengthen the spleen, and calm the spirit. If there are no internal changes and no external complications, there’s a 30-40% chance of recovery. However, if after cutting the black color continues to spread, pain and swelling worsen, and there’s no pus but dry mouth and a hard tongue, leading to a sluggish spirit and tastelessness in food, it will ultimately result in death. </p>
<p>In treating this, one should not rely solely on one’s own judgment but must consult illustrious experts and heed the patient’s wishes regarding the surgery. Furthermore, because this condition can have varying prognoses, it is unwise to act hastily. There are cases that appear similar but are not the same, true conditions that present differently, and detailed annotations are provided later for reference.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Gangrene often occurs on the toes rather than the fingers. When it first appears as a yellow blister, it should be cauterized. If it arises like a grain, with a space inside to hold millet, and the skin is purplish-red without causing burning or swelling, it should still be cauterized. After cauterization, if the wound absorbs heat and forms blisters filled with pus, external medicine should be applied while internally supporting the healing process. When the poison has developed, and the wound is slightly depressed, but the purplish color has not affected the surface of the foot, it should be evaluated for possible surgical removal. After removal, if blood and fluids flow profusely with ongoing pain, one must tonify the qi and blood, and strengthen the spleen and stomach. If recovery is slow, with decreased appetite, body fatigue, dry mouth, and frequent thirst, one should nourish the body fluids and strengthen kidney essence. Following the breakout, if qi and blood are injured, with weak spleen and stomach, spontaneous sweating, feeling hot and nauseous, restless sleep, fever in the afternoon, and severe pain, one must significantly enhance qi and blood. For those indulging in rich and greasy foods, or with repressed desires leading to toxins and stagnant blood over time, one must avoid surgical methods.</p>
<p>Chronic eruptions are caused by improper seasonal elements, manifesting without internal toxins. This condition often appears on the palms and soles, or in the areas of the waist, legs, and buttocks where movement occurs, causing diffuse swelling without a distinct head, aversion to cold, fever, heaviness in the limbs, and intense thirst. At the onset, one should take a universal remedy to induce sweating and relieve the exterior; if the swelling does not subside, it is likely to form pus, and one should take a detoxifying remedy combined with the wax alum pills. Subsequent treatments should follow the established protocols for managing boils, sores, and ulcers.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pomegranate Blister</strong></p>
<p>Pomegranate blister occurs when the Shaoyang fire interacts with external dampness, resulting in a condition that manifests on the inner elbow approximately one inch from the joint. It starts as a small yellow blister, which quickly enlarges, becoming red and firm, swollen like a covered bowl. When the skin ruptures, it exudes, resembling clumped pomegranate seeds and causing cold chills, akin to a severe illness. At the onset, perform moxibustion nine times, and take toad venom pills for sweating to release the hidden poison. Apply moxibustion to the top, stick a toad venom cake on it, and cover with ointment; for swollen areas, apply golden yellow powder. Internally, take chrysanthemum clearing decoction and amber wax alumen pills. If there is severe agitation and fever, use Heart-Protecting Powder and Golden Liquid Earth Pill. After nine days, if the affected area produces thick yellow pus and pain slightly decreases, with symptoms improving inside and out, and if there is slight improvement in appetite, it can be seen as safe; conversely, if not, it is a bad sign. After rupture, if vital energy is weak and mixed symptoms persist, treat according to the methods for managing abscesses.</p>
<p><strong>Ankle Blister</strong></p>
<p>Ankle blister develops from the downward flow and stagnation of damp heat in the three Yin channels of the foot. It initially presents as swelling and pain at the inner ankle, with the pain penetrating to the bone, making movements difficult, and in severe cases, extending to the outer ankle. If the swelling has a head, it indicates a Yang-type easy to break; if no head is present, it is a Yin-type, difficult to rupture. In both cases, at the onset, chills and fever must alternate, and it is advisable to use a modified Jingfang Baidu Powder with added Niuxi Powder; if pus forms and swelling is painful for a long time, acupuncture is recommended; for decay without closure and large openings, double the use of Yuhong Ointment; for those with weakened bodies, provide nourishment.

In mild cases, the swelling gradually diminishes; in more severe cases, it may burst and produce pus, and in extreme cases, can lead to decay. After it has burst, if swelling persists, a toad venom stick should be inserted into the opening, covered with a medicated ointment for effectiveness.

At the onset, the affected area should be punctured, then covered with toad venom cake and a golden salve. After three days, if swelling accumulates and pus is formed, change the dressing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blood Wind Sores</strong></p>
<p>Blood wind sores arise from the interaction of wind heat, damp heat, and blood heat. When they occur, they cause intense itching, breaking open and leaking fatty fluid, gradually spreading. In severe cases, orally take Xiao Feng San with Niu Xi and Huang Bo; externally apply antidote powder (Xiong Huang San) or Ruyi Jin Huang San as dressings. If the sores are long-standing, purple, blackened, and hardened, causing stagnant qi and blood, use needles to remove the black blood and then use a magical lamp for steaming to dispel toxins. Afterwards, apply the aforementioned medicine for effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Itching of Women&#39;s Feet</strong></p>
<p>Itching of women&#39;s feet originates from the Three Yang wind dampness descending, becoming stagnant and not dispersing. Thus, it first causes itching and later results in damp sores. Additionally, itching and dampness may occur at the curved areas of the soles; a mix of powdered alum can be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Cracked Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>Cracked hands and feet indicate dryness, due to insufficient nourishment from qi and blood. When heat in the muscles is suddenly attacked by wind and cold, it hinders the blood vessels, leading the skin to become increasingly dry and withered, resulting in cracks. Daily exposure to wind and the compounding effects of wind heat cause pain. Use Yu Ji San to wash and rub the skin, and apply a moisturizing ointment. In severe cases, it is also beneficial to take Dang Gui Yin Zi.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

<p>Crabgrass bumps are caused by harm to the spleen from excessive thinking, leading to the stagnation of spleen qi. This condition often affects those with deficient qi and blood; it mainly manifests in the limbs, which are associated with the spleen&#39;s earth element. Initially, there is bone pain, which gradually develops into swelling that is firm and not hot or red. The back of the hand and the inner aspect of the wrist swell in multiple areas, preventing movement. Over time, it resembles the consistency of tofu and leaks a fluid that connects various orifices, flowing continuously day and night, alongside persistent swelling and pain. Patients appear pale and thin, with diminished appetite. Prolonged cases result in alternating chills and fever and internal symptoms manifesting. For treatment, both Qi-nourishing and Shen-boosting medicinal formulas, such as the Qi Nourishing Decoction and the Modified Xiao Yao San, are recommended for harmonizing qi and blood while supporting the spleen and stomach.

In severe cases, the whole foot may swell, with accompanying chills and fever. The first step in treatment is to wash with a licorice decoction and apply toad venom cakes three pieces over three days. Subsequently, use pearl powder mixed with pig spinal marrow for topical application and cover with a medicated ointment. Apply the True Monarch Miracle Paste to reduce swelling.

<p>Niu Cheng (Foot Edema) occurs when one travels rapidly, causing heat and moisture in the feet. This leads to stagnation of qi and depletion of blood, resulting in the formation of hard and stubborn skin. The body fails to nourish the area, gradually causing swelling and pain, with swollen areas becoming high and protruding, making movement difficult. If allowed to persist, they may rupture, leading to pus discharge. Daily cleansing with warm water and applying powdered ox horn, along with addressing internal pus, is recommended. For stubborn skin that does not break, use a large, sharp needle to pierce the area to release pus and provide relief. If the hardened skin ruptures, it should be cut away. If flesh does not grow back, use jade-red ointment to promote its growth. If flesh is present but no new skin has formed, apply pearl powder to help generate skin and achieve healing.</p>
<p><strong>Insect Borers (Cockroach Borer)</strong></p>
<p>Insect borers often occur in the joints of fingers, appearing without redness or heat, and swelling resembling a cicada&#39;s abdomen. This condition is caused by the accumulation of phlegm and qi stagnation in the Hand Shaoyin channel. Initially, it is painless, but over time it becomes painful. Prolonged pain leads to decay, while the swelling persists. Applying toad venom cakes can help create thin pus. This condition may affect those who are physically weak and requires internal nourishing medicines to prevent it from developing into a chronic ailment.</p>
<p><strong>Field Snail Blisters</strong></p>
<p>Field snail blisters typically manifest on hands and feet, feeling as if they are burning with fire, followed by the development of purple, white, and yellow blisters. This is caused by wind and dampness attacking the Spleen channel, leading to gradual swelling, pain, and restlessness. Puncturing the blisters with a needle helps to release toxic fluid, after which a protective ointment should be applied. If blisters reappear, internal detoxification and Spleen-discharging decoctions may lead to healing.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

<p>Goose Palm Wind arises from the yangming stomach channel, characterized by hot, dry blood, and is caused by exposure to cold, leading to dry and withered skin.

<p>Nuan Abscess occurs on the shoulder and extends to swelling around the shoulder area, characterized by hardness. Dui Abscess appears at the site of the radial artery, with swelling and pain, alternating between cold and heat, affecting the shoulder and causing difficulty in movement. Fu Yin Abscess develops three inches above the inner ankle, starting as small blisters, eventually becoming red and swollen, leading to bleeding and bone-deep pain, making walking impossible. Yao Bone Abscess occurs in the inner thigh, with no swelling or redness, but excruciating pain deep within the marrow; it is best initially treated with the Thunder Fire Needle, accompanied by internal administration of Wansheng Pill, mixed with wine for effectiveness. Yin Abscess arises three inches below the right inner thigh, causing pain radiating to the groin and lower abdomen. Yuan Abscess appears three inches below the left inner thigh, with diffuse swelling affecting the groin, and pain reaching the thigh. </p>
<p>For the above conditions with initial external symptoms, it is advisable to release the exterior; for internal symptoms, one should promote internal flow. After rupture, it is necessary to nourish the area; if it persists, one should focus on contraction.

<p>Medical Prescriptions Examination (Ming, Wu Kun)</p>
<p>Discussion on Foot Illness</p>
<p>The foot illness resembles typhoid, thus hard to diagnose; it can lead to death, thus difficult to treat. One disease, two difficulties; this cannot simply be discussed regarding foot illness. I examine seven prescriptions; fellow practitioners, please teach me as well!</p>
<p>Foot illness exhibits aversion to cold or strong heat, and Foria can be the main remedy. The essence of foot illness lies in the damp heat accumulating in the feet, causing painful sensations. When dampness and heat contend, if dampness prevails, it induces cold aversion; if heat prevails, it induces strong heat. This serves as the evidence. There are also those with accompanying headaches, resembling typhoid, yet their illness begins from foot illness, which is different.</p>
<p>One should not restrict based on foot swelling; there are also cases of pain without swelling called &#39;dry foot illness&#39;. Some are characterized by slow progression that does not comply, termed &#39;gentle wind&#39;. Others with painful numbness are called &#39;damp obstruction&#39;, and those with cramping or spasms are termed &#39;wind toxin&#39;. This should be understood and differentiated by physicians, and each has its own treatment methods.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, foot illness is a condition of obstruction, favoring openness and disliking blockage. Hence, Master Sun stated: “Those suffering from foot illness die due to excess qi; not a single person has perished from taking medicine that leads to deficiency.” Therefore, those with foot illness should not receive substantial tonics nor excessive purgatives. The prescriptions consist of Mutong, Foria, and Areca nut, which are harmonizing agents that can relieve blockage. Rhino horn, Huangbai, Sheng Dihuang, and licorice tips are cooling agents that can dispel heat. Cangzhu and Baizhu are drying agents that can eliminate dampness.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chuanxiong can disperse the qi within the blood, while rhinoceros horn can promote the blood within the qi. If pain occurs first and then swelling, it indicates that qi has injured the blood; therefore, use more Chuanxiong. If swelling occurs first and then pain, it indicates that blood has injured the qi; hence, use more rhinoceros horn. If the stools are firm, add peach kernel; if the urine is scanty, add cowbane; if there is internal heat, add scutellaria and coptis; if there is seasonal heat, add gypsum; if there is phlegm, add bamboo juice. It all depends on adapting the method; do not be too rigid initially. In cases where foot-related ailments affect the heart, causing persistent wheezing or vomiting, they are all fatal, as water clashes with fire.</p>
<p>In cases of foot-related pain and swelling, with cold and hot sensations intertwined, if the pulse is deep and fine, the prescription should be Guo Bi Decoction. The essence of the pain lies in the obstruction of qi, while the swelling results from stagnation of blood; this is the reason for the confinement of foot illnesses. The interplay of cold and heat signifies the conflict between pathogenic forces and righteous qi. A deep pulse indicates an interior condition, while a fine pulse indicates a yin condition. The name Guo Bi implies surpassing and emerging from the lowest state; &quot;bi&quot; suggests humility. This formula aims to release and elevate the most obstructed qi, hence the name. Gypsum is cold and heavy, with cold able to overcome heat and heaviness able to descend. Aconite is spicy and hot, with spiciness aiding in expelling obstructions and heat promoting qi. When combined with ephedra, the stagnation of cold and heat can be expelled through sweat. Utilizing white atractylodes and licorice, which have a warm and balanced flavor, can help harmonize the Qi and facilitate elevation beyond obstruction. However, licorice should be used sparingly, as its slow nature could delay swift action towards the lowest areas.</p>
<p>In cases of cold-damp foot ailments, characterized by pain and numbness, if the pulse at both ankles is deep and fine, the prescription should be Six Medicines Aconite Decoction, treating this as a painful obstruction syndrome.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: When cold dominates, it results in painful obstruction; when dampness dominates, it leads to blockage. Presently, if there is pain and numbness, it is due to both cold and dampness. The pulse at the two inches (measure of the body) pertains to the two feet; a pulse that is deep indicates an interior condition, and a slow pulse indicates cold. </p>
<p>For treatment, use the heartwood of cinnamon and aconite to warm the cold, while prepared leech and white atractylodes address the dampness. Licorice and poria are beneficial for the spleen, helping to support the deficient earth energy and control the excess dampness. It is essential to take cooling medicines to ensure the properties of cinnamon and aconite act downward and do not spread horizontally.</p>
<p>In cases of foot qi (pathological condition) transforming into internal issues, it leads to an inability to have smooth bowel movements. If foot qi affects the liver, there may be a lump in the left flank; if it affects the spleen, it causes a feeling of fullness; if it affects the heart, it may result in death at night, as the night energy supports the yin evils. </p>
<p>Due to extreme cold, if one is unaware of their condition, the yin invades and the yang cannot be released. Thus, cedar wood decoction is recommended, as cedar is dense and aromatic—dense enough to reach downward and aromatic enough to disperse stagnation. The flavor of citrus leaves is bitter and rich, surpassing that of green peel; areca nut is solid and heavy, comparable to iron stone. A rich taste promotes downward movement, and dense material causes descent, allowing the pathogenic qi to descend significantly.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s urine is salty and cold; the salty nature can lead pathogenic qi to exit with turbid yin, while the cold can balance excessive heat and prevent it from rising. The text states: &quot;What is distant in the Way must be greatly controlled.&quot; Therefore, the quantity is five sheng. </p>
<p>For those suffering from cold damp foot qi, with pain and numbness, they should take decoctions internally and wash externally with a pepper soup.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Practices of the Physician&#39;s Realm [Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Treatment of Beriberi with the Enhanced Eight Flavor Pill</strong></p>
<p>The ancient formula, the Eight Flavor Pill of the Cui family, incorporates two yang herbs—Aconite and Cinnamon—alongside six yin herbs including Rehmannia. The &quot;Jin Kui&quot; text suggests its use for treating beriberi, which ascends and affects the lower abdomen, indicating a thought that is rather subtle. It implies that when earth energy increases towards heaven, one must use the aggressive properties of Ginger and Aconite to overcome it. </p>
<p>When the earth energy arrives in the lower abdomen, it dwells on the boundary of extreme yin, which predicates that there is no reason for excessive agitation; thus, only yang herbs are added to the yin herbs for treatment, and there is no need for a complete focus on yang. </p>
<p>In cases where kidney water overflows, causing issues like urinary difficulties in women—referred to as &quot;transforming the womb&quot;—the formula’s name is changed to Kidney Energy Pill, although the ingredients remain the same. This is because it captures the kidney energy, allowing the kidney water to return to its source, leading to normalized urination, hence there is no need to overly emphasize yang. </p>
<p>In consideration of this, when treating conditions characterized by yang deficiency and yin excess, it is essential to utilize purely yang without incorporating yin. There is no further doubt on this approach.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Later generations, when dealing with foot odor entering the abdomen, find the lower abdomen lacking sensation, and experience a sudden onset of shortness of breath, vomiting, and sweating. They fail to recognize that the earthly energy has intensified and affects the heavenly energy. Using this formula inappropriately, they claim this symptom is most urgent, citing the kidney overpowering the heart, with water overcoming fire, leading to death in an instant. Using the original formula with double the amounts of aconite and cinnamon can only be seen as fifty steps laughing at a hundred steps; it does not address the critical illness, as the kidney overpowering the heart and water overcoming fire is the most immediate concern. They do not understand that the organs mutually hinder each other, which poses a significant danger, and they cannot discern the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhu proposed treating foot odor by transforming the Eight Flavor Pill into the Eight Flavor Decoction, using aconite, dried ginger, peony, poria, licorice, cinnamon heart, ginseng, and white atractylodes. The reasoning is quite refined, and by further adapting the peony, licorice, and ginseng in clinical practice, it enhances its efficacy. However, unwise individuals again insert their interpretations into this decoction, removing the cinnamon heart and adding dried rehmannia, switching yin for yang—what a drastic deviation!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inability to Lift the Limbs</strong></p>
<p>When a stroke causes the limbs to be unable to lift, it can be either deficiency or excess. If there is deficiency in the Yangming, the tendons lose their nourishment, and the bones cannot be bound, leading to difficulty in movement. If there is excess in the Yangming, the flesh becomes dense, and with the invasion of wind, the upright Qi cannot circulate. For deficiency, use Six Gentlemen Decoction; for excess, combine Three Transformations Decoction with Purging the Qi Decoction. When treating stroke-induced limb inabilities, if one cannot distinguish between deficiency and excess and recklessly tries to tonify or drain, the practitioner is at fault. The inability to lift the limbs all pertains to the spleen and earth element. If there is excessive consumption of rich foods, leading to internal heat and congestion, it indicates stagnation in the spleen, and it should be drained to relieve this blockage. If there is little food intake and the body is thin, along with lethargy and a tendency to sleep, it indicates deficiency and weakness of the spleen, and it should be tonified to strengthen its function. If one indiscriminately tonifies the excess and drains the deficiency, could it not harm the patient?</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>Crane knee wind refers to the stiffness caused by wind, cold, and dampness affecting the knee. If the bones of the knee grow larger over time and the surrounding muscles become thin and withered, and one cannot yet treat the knee itself, one must first nourish the blood and qi, allowing the muscles to gradually thrive before treating the knee. This approach is similar to treating cases where one side of the body is withered. Once there is atrophy, one must first nourish the parts that are not yet withered, so that the withered parts may regain circulation and vitality. If one does not understand the principle of drawing qi to nourish blood, and blood to aid qi, but simply uses herbs like Ephedra and Ledebouriella to dispel wind, there are few who are not completely withered and perishing. Thus, in treating crane knee wind by hastily attacking the stiffness, one must also consider the atrophy of the foot, which becomes unusable. Consequently, when discussing the treatment approach, isn&#39;t it evident?</p>
<p>The ancient method for treating children with crane knee wind involves using the Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill augmented with deer antler and cattle knee, totaling eight ingredients, without addressing the wind; this is the most commendable intention. For children&#39;s cases are not necessarily due to wind, cold, or dampness, but often result from innate deficiencies, where the kidney energy is weak and cold accumulates in the lower back and knees, causing obstruction. Therefore, the Six Flavors Pill replenishes the water in the kidneys; deer antler supplements the fire in the kidneys; and cattle knee directs it to the joints to strengthen the tendons and muscles. This is an excellent method of treating the root rather than the symptoms, using this example to generalize the principle.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Gout</strong></p>
<p>The concept of gout did not exist in ancient times; it was first named during the Jin Dynasty by Su Jing. However, its symptoms of swelling, pain, and numbness are what the classics refer to as &quot;bi&quot; (obstruction); its looseness and inability to retract correspond to &quot;wei&quot; (atrophy) in the classics; and when severe enough to cause an upward rush, it corresponds to &quot;jue ni&quot; (counterflow) in the classics. </p>
<p>Later generations distinguished it as one of the four patterns of fever, categorizing it as gout if a person exhibits headaches, fever, body pain, and constipation, accompanied by weak and powerless legs and knees. This explanation is too muddled; I disagree with it. Gout is fundamentally a disease caused by dampness and blockage, not an exterior pathogenic invasion. There are cases where multiple symptoms may occur together, but if one misidentifies weakness of the legs due to external pathogens as gout, it leads to confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Now I will omit the unnecessary details and summarize the key points, ensuring no aspect is overlooked for clarity. </p>
<p>Initially, the symptoms of gout are very mild, with diet and movement remaining normal; it may suddenly appear without any other illness or develop gradually following another illness. When the disease manifests, it can affect the area from the knees to the feet in various ways: numbness, cold pain, weakness, cramps, swelling or no swelling, gradual atrophy, or fluctuating between fever and chills. It may feel as if water is cold or fire is hot; there may be a change in appetite, it may be possible or impossible to eat, or one may feel a sensation of something like a finger pressing down from the calf, causing a rush of qi to ascend to the heart. All of these represent the true illness of gout.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are symptoms such as fever and headache, alternating chills and fever, abdominal pain, vomiting upon seeing food, aversion to the smell of food, reluctance to see light, confusion in speech, and mental disorientation; all of these are accompanying symptoms of beriberi. Generally, these symptoms can be either mild or severe: in mild cases, they gradually appear, worsening over two or three months; in severe cases, they arise quickly, sometimes within one or two days. If treated as mild when it is severe, there is a risk that the internal energy could rise to the heart, potentially leading to death.</p>
<p>The causes of beriberi are twofold: one from external sources and one from internal factors. The external causes involve the influence of cold, dampness, rain, and humidity, or sitting or lying on damp ground, which leads to the invasion of damp pathogens into the skin, flesh, and tendons. When dampness affects vulnerability, the illness begins in the lower body, resulting in leg and foot problems. The internal causes stem from excessive consumption of rich, sweet foods, alcohol, and unrestrained intake of foods like dairy products that create damp heat, which causes heat to obstruct the lower regions of the body, leading to swelling and pain in the legs, or even affecting the hands and joints.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was said that in the southern regions where the climate is humid, illnesses are often caused by external factors, whereas in the north, where there is a penchant for alcoholic beverages, illnesses are commonly due to internal factors. This is indeed one perspective. However, the north also has cold dampness, and the south certainly cannot be devoid of wine-related dampness. Thus, it need not be strictly categorized by geographical regions. Whether the cause is internal or external, any invasion of harmful qi resulting in illness that begins in the feet and gradually leads to other symptoms is referred to as beriberi. It is essential to investigate the cause and to treat it; if done correctly, there will be no errors.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

<p>The disease of athlete&#39;s foot is indeed caused by the three energies, yet there are also distinctions between deficiency and excess. Furthermore, athlete&#39;s foot is fundamentally a condition of stagnation. The ancients cautioned against the use of tonics; however, it is only when the fundamentals are insufficient and the energy of Yangming is impaired that the evil energies are allowed to invade, and there are also cases of deficiency involved. In summary, for all treatments of this condition, it is essential to apply remedies based on the symptoms; thus, management will be thorough. If the cause lies externally, focus primarily on dispersion; if the cause lies internally, emphasize unblocking and benefiting. External causes are often associated with cold and dampness, so warming treatments are advisable; internal causes frequently involve dampness and heat, hence cooling treatments should be employed. If the original energy is fundamentally deficient or if prolonged illness has led to deficiency, it is essential to nourish the foundations and one must not be bound by the notion of avoiding tonics.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When athlete&#39;s foot first appears, it is primarily due to dampness and stagnation. If there are no other concurrent symptoms, and the body feels heavy, then one should focus on treating the dampness, primarily through diuresis. </p>
<p>For general dampness in the feet and knees, or when there is soreness and heaviness in the waist and legs, one should use a dampness-dissipating decoction, regardless of whether the condition is recent or longstanding, or whether it is dry or damp. If there is soreness and heaviness in the feet and knees, accompanied by unclear stomach qi, or symptoms like belching, acid reflux, or fullness, then Ping Wei San (a formula for regulating the stomach) is recommended. For swelling inthe feet accompanied by diarrhea, one should use Wu Ling San or Wei Ling Tang.</p>
<p>When cold and dampness invade from the outside and lead to athlete&#39;s foot, this accounts for about sixty to seventy percent of cases. Symptoms typically include pain, cramping, aversion to cold, and a thin, wiry pulse. The treatment should focus on warming the meridians and dispelling dampness. Therefore, ancient remedies primarily used warming herbs and fewer cooling ones, often employing materials like Ma Huang, Chuan Wu, Gui, Fu, and Gan Jiang.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Dampness that prevails within should be treated with bitter and warming herbs.&quot; This is why herbs like Wu and Fu, along with Ma Huang, are able to move without obstruction, thus facilitating the circulation of the meridians.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Taboo</strong></p>
<p>It is said in &quot;The Living Man&quot; and other texts that any tonic herbs taken for athlete&#39;s foot, and those used for soaking and washing, are prohibited by doctors. This is but a partial view. There are indeed certain tonics that should be avoided, particularly those that might cause stagnation of evil energies. Similarly, certain washing methods should be avoided if they involve water that exacerbates dampness or heat. If the lower body is deficient and cold, whether due to an illness or excessive depletion, and the athlete&#39;s foot does not improve, how can one still prohibit tonics? Furthermore, if cold, damp, or hot evils are obstructing and causing swelling or pain, one should use aromatic and dispersive herbs in stews or washes to quickly expel the evils. How can washing be prohibited in such cases? However, if damp heat is rising and disturbing the heart and abdomen, one should not wash abruptly, as this might further elevate dampness. It is essential to first lower the energy; once the toxins are resolved in the feet, washing can be performed without detriment. Toning is for replenishing weakness, while washing is for expelling stagnation. Thus, why should there be any prohibition?</p>
<p><strong>On Ancient Practices</strong></p>
<p>Yang Dashou stated: Athlete&#39;s foot is a condition of stagnation; therefore, one should use dispersing agents to prevent energy from becoming stagnant. Remedies like Qianghuo Daodi Decoction and similar ones are effective. Additionally, herbs such as Cangshu, Baizhu, Fangji, and Nanzheng are used to remove dampness; Qianghuo, Duhuo, Mugua, and Binglang help facilitate energy and relieve joint blockages; while guiding herbs like Mutong and Niuxi direct the treatment, and Danggui and Shengdi Huang harmonize the blood. These are essential medicines. Likewise, methods from Dongyuan for pain are also quite effective; I analyze the deficiency or excess of weakness and heat and distinguish treatments accordingly. This represents a flexible approach to healing.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the knees swell and ache while the legs are thin and small, it is called Crane Knee Wind, named for its resemblance to the shape of a crane&#39;s knee. Sometimes, it manifests simply as swelling in both knees, with thin and withered legs that cannot bend or stretch, commonly referred to as Drumstick Wind. Ultimately, it results from the afflictions of wind, cold, and dampness. However, swelling and pain must be due to an obstruction, while thinning and withering are usually caused by blood deficiency. </p>
<p>For treating this condition, the primary focus must be on nourishing qi and nourishing blood. If there is wind, one must also dispel it; if there is cold and dampness, these must be eliminated as well. If the condition develops into heat due to obstruction, it is essential to nourish yin and clear heat, and recovery will inevitably follow. If it arises after dysentery, it is also known as Post-Dysentery Wind, as the loss of yin during diarrhea requires strengthening of the kidneys. </p>
<p>For cases with dominance of cold, it is advisable to use formulations like Sanqi Drink, Wujisci Powder, or Da Fang Feng Decoction; for those with dominance of dampness, Wuling Powder or Lijiang Decoction are appropriate; and for heat dominance, Baoyin Decoction or Da Qin Jiao Decoction should be used.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Prescription of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain in Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>If someone experiences pain in their hands and feet, people may attribute it to heat in the spleen channel, not realizing that it is not the spleen but rather the stagnation of liver wood. By dispersing this stagnation, the pain in the hands and feet will go away. Use a prescription of Xiaoyao San (Free and Easy Wanderer Powder) with three qian of gardenia fruit, two qian each of pinellia and white mustard seed, decoct in water and take it. After two doses, the pain will be as if it has vanished. It is said that when the liver wood causes trouble, the spleen does not dare to confront its sharpness, and the qi disperses into the limbs, becoming constrained and unyielding, which is why pain arises. Now, once the liver qi is balanced, the spleen qi will naturally relax. When the spleen relaxes, is there a pain remaining in the hands and feet that cannot be eliminated? </p>
<p>For those with pain in their hands and feet, have one person hold the body while two others gently press down on each leg, one on the left foot and one on the right, lightly tapping them a thousand times. They will feel a slight relief in both feet. Then, use the hand to hold the area between the knee and ankle, gently stretch it seven times, and finally, loosen the grip and knead the feet a thousand times before stopping. Do the same for both hands. Within a day, the pain in the hands and feet can be alleviated.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For pain in the legs and below the waist, use two liters of yellow wine, half a pound of astragalus, five ounces of Coix seed, one ounce of Eucommia bark, five qian of poria and saposhnikovia, three qian of plantago seeds, and one qian of cinnamon. Boil with a bowl of water until it reduces to two bowls of juice. Add this to the wine, and consuming it will lead to recovery. The aforementioned pains are due to wind entering the limbs, head, between the shoulder blades, and below the waist. The use of yellow wine is essential, as it reaches all pathways, directing the medicinal properties straight to the afflicted areas. The pain in the waist and feet clearly belongs to kidney deficiency and weakened qi, which cannot facilitate movement; coupled with dampness, this results in suffering. The essence lies in not supplementing the kidney but solely boosting qi. Sufficient qi generates blood, and when blood is formed, the pathogens retreat. Additionally, Coix seed, poria, and plantago aid in removing dampness, and with the dampness gone, the blood becomes more vibrant. Moreover, adding Eucommia for strengthening the kidneys, and cinnamon for warming the kidneys, along with saposhnikovia for dispelling wind, creates a synergistic effect. They support and complement each other, which is a natural principle.</p>
<p>For soreness in both legs, this indicates that dampness has penetrated the bones, while there may be no external dampness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of this method lies in the fact that Job&#39;s tears can penetrate the bones and eliminate moisture, while adding water chestnut strengthens the spleen to dispel dampness, preventing moisture from accumulating further. Moreover, Achyranthes and Rhizoma Dioscoreae are particularly beneficial for the lower limbs, and with the addition of cinnamon to guide the herbs directly into the bones, how could the dampness remain and how could the pain persist? However, ailments in the feet are the lower aspects of the human body, and any illness is hard to eradicate. Furthermore, when dampness is lodged in the bones, it resembles low-lying land that has long become a pool; simply carting away the water won&#39;t suffice. It requires considerable effort before it can be fully drained, thus necessitating prolonged and repeated application, which is precisely the intent here.</p>
<p>Foot pain is prevalent and difficult to treat because the feet represent the lower aspect of the body, and when dampness invades, it accumulates stubbornly. Therefore, one must elevate the vital energy for the dampness to disperse. Nowadays, people often use Pingwei Powder to treat dampness, which is indeed a well-trodden approach, yet it ultimately cannot resolve the dampness completely. I propose a new formula that can thoroughly address the invasion of dampness in the feet.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Bleeding Between the Fingers</h3>
<p>Some individuals experience continuous bleeding between their fingers, with tiny insects similar to mayflies emerging and quickly able to fly away. This condition is caused by damp heat generating insects. However, why can these insects fly? This is because it is not only damp heat involved but also accompanied by wind pathogenic factors. All insects that are affected by wind can have wings and fly. How can they not fly when the wind energy affects the human body? The prescription consists of Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Dong Gui, Bai Shao, and Sheng Gan Cao each at 9 grams, Ren Shen, Chai Hu, Chuan Xiong, and Jing Jie each at 3 grams, and Shu Di, Huang Qi, and Yi Ren each at 25 grams, to be boiled and consumed as a decoction. The brilliance of this formula lies in that it does not focus on killing the insects but instead nourishes Qi and blood, while also helping to eliminate dampness and wind. When the Qi and blood in the human body are harmonious, insects naturally do not arise. By nourishing the harmony of Qi and blood, there will be no place for insects to hide. Furthermore, by dispelling water and wind, where can the insects live? This is what makes this formula both simple and remarkable.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Elevation in the Palm</strong></p>
<p>Within the palm, a sudden elevation of an inch occurs, without pain or itch. This is due to the fire of the Yangming channel not dispersing and accumulating in the hand. Typically, it should cause pain or itch, but now there is none. Not only is the fire congested in the pores, but also water is blocked in the skin. The method should employ external medicine to dissipate it. The fire of Yangming being intense must lead to thirst, prompting continual drinking. However, the absence of thirst suggests that the fire in the stomach has completely dispersed, turning into poison in the palm. This indicates that the individual&#39;s Yangming fire was initially strong, and pressing the hand against a bed or mat forcefully impeded the circulation of qi and blood in the palm. Over time, the elevation occurs without pain or itch, essentially becoming dead flesh.</p>
<p>Using a decoction of Aconite, soak the hand until it cools, and continue this for ten days. Eventually, there will certainly be pain, and further soaking will lead to itch, after which the elevated area will flatten. Aconite is extremely warming, entering through all meridians; even external application will penetrate internally. If Aconite is used in a soup for drinking, it will warm the entire body and stimulate the stomach fire, preventing the flesh of the palm from dissipating while internally causing a rise in heat. This is why I treat it externally to achieve healing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If someone develops two fingers beneath their foot, causing unbearable pain, it is due to the accumulation of damp-heat, specifically offending the spirits. Take one part borax, one tael of scallion, three parts ice fragments, and one qian of ginseng, and grind them into a powder.

If it flows for three days, it&#39;ll stop, and the pain will lessen. Next, use five qian of white atractylodes, three qian each of raw licorice, ginseng, cattle knee, spatholobus, and white mustard seed, one tael of job&#39;s tears, and one qian of pinellia. Decoct in water for four doses, which can lead to full recovery and the disappearance of the fingers as they dissolve into water.

<p>Another mixture involves evenly grinding the two ingredients into a powder, forming wine pills, with each dose consisting of 59 or 100 pills taken with warm wine, known as Zhu Yu Pills, used for similar conditions.</p>
<p>Xiao Feng Yin Decoction treats weak patients with pain in the waist and legs caused by wind stroke. This is also referred to as &quot;Da Feng Yin Decoction&quot; by Hu Qia. It excludes dried ginger and stone frog, but includes cinnamon bark and astragalus. The ingredients are as follows: three taels each of Du Huo, Fu Ling, and Ren Shen; two taels each of Fang Feng, Dang Gui (body), Gan Cao, Gan Jiang, and Shi Hu; one piece of peeled Fu Zi; two sheng of soybeans. </p>
<p>These ten ingredients should be chewed, boiled with 9 liters of water and 3 liters of wine, and reduced to 3 liters, divided into four doses. Each should be taken similarly after walking ten miles. Hu Qia states that in the south, treatments for weak legs differ, using 1 tael each of Sheng Ma, Ban Xia, and Shao Yao, equating to thirteen ingredients. The original formula consists of ten ingredients, reducing Dang Gui and Shi Hu, thus named Xiao Feng Yin Decoction. The simplification omits Shi Hu to treat extreme cold in the flesh, muscle changes, and weakness of the tongue, collectively referred to as &quot;evil wind,&quot; with symptoms of waist pain and weak legs.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a></p></div>

<p>This formula is used to treat wind and dampness attacking the body, resulting in painful bones and joints, stiffness of the limbs, inability to bend or stretch, increased pain upon approach, spontaneous sweating and shortness of breath, difficulty in urination, aversion to wind and reluctance to remove clothing, and occasional swelling of the head, face, hands, and feet.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 pieces of Fuzi (Aconite)</li>
<li>4 taels of Gui Xin (Cinnamon Heart)</li>
<li>2 taels each of Baizhu (Atractylodes) and Gancao (Licorice)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:<br>Combine the four ingredients, crush them, and boil with six liters of water to obtain three liters of liquid. Divide into three doses; a slight sweat should result in recovery. For those with significant sweating and discomfort, take one dose of five liang (a weight measure). If the body is swollen, add four taels of Fangji (Stephania). For palpitations and difficulty in urination, add three taels of Fuling (Poria). Finally, if Fuzi is present, add three taels of fresh ginger.</p>
<p>Another formula:<br>This treats weak feet due to wind poison, swelling of the face caused by southern miasma, alternating chills and fevers resembling malaria, swelling in the feet, and symptoms such as heaviness in the heart and coughing, as well as paralysis and stubborn numbness.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 taels each of Maren (Sesame), Shengma (Cimicifuga), Mahuang (Ephedra), Shegan (Belamcanda), Changpu (Acorus), Mangxiao (Glauber&#39;s salt), Gancao (Licorice), and Dahuang (Rhubarb)</li>
<li>3 he (a volume measure) of Dou (Fermented soybean)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:<br>Combine the nine ingredients, crush them, and boil with six liters of water to obtain two and a half liters of liquid. Then boil Mangxiao additionally for three times. Divide into three doses; a slight purgation of one or two movements will relieve toxicity and heat, and any swelling should dissipate. If there is a sensation of fullness, take one dose, which is beneficial. According to “Yannian Miji”, Mangxiao is half a tael, and this is the same as stated in “Waitai”.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a></p></div>

Once this condition arises, it may lead to sores that are difficult to treat; it is wise to take this as a preventive measure, which may help alleviate severe conditions to lighter ones, or from deeper to shallower issues.

<p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>Liu Dayin from Shicun treats ulcerated sores with a medicated plaster: Use four taels of sesame oil, heat in a copper pot, and add three stalks of green onion, boiling until they turn black; then add one tael of ground Sichuan pepper, boil until black, and strain away; add one tael of copper green powder and ten branches of locust wood, each one foot long, and stir together, burn one segment off until it is fully utilized; then add one tael of alum and five qian of yellow wax, simmer for a long time until it becomes a paste. Each time, place a spoonful of the paste wrapped in oil paper and pierce it with a silver needle to create many small holes. Clean the wound with strong tea before applying the paste, changing it repeatedly, and a stinging sensation is a good sign. Usually, one or two applications yield quick results, and for long-standing cases, no more than five to seven applications are needed. The longer the paste is stored, the more effective it becomes.</p>
<p>Liu Chuanzhou&#39;s formula for treating ulcerated sores: Use one tael of fragrance oil, heating it in an iron ladle, and add five qian of yellow wax to dissolve; then add three qian of copper green powder, grinding it very finely, and slowly mixing it into the iron ladle for more than fifty times; separate the powdered copper money into another bowl, pour the mixture into the bowl, and let it cool and set. Clean the sore and place a piece of felt, sized to the sore, on top of it, applying the medicine and securing it in place, changing it once a day. Be sure to wash the sore clean before each change.</p>
<p>For muscle cramps in the feet: Soak old cotton in vinegar, steam it hot, wrap it around, and change it once it cools. Do not stop until healed. </p>
<p>For all cases of swelling and pain in the soles of the feet, or those caused by prolonged walking or standing, mix dirt from earthworms with water and apply thickly; it will heal overnight.<a id="trans-320p" href="#orig-320p" class="marker">[320p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When an ingrown toenail causes a sore, the nail grows into the flesh, making it impossible to wear boots. Apply burnt alum ash to it, which erodes the bad flesh and encourages the growth of healthy flesh. Carefully trim away the nail edges, and after ten days, it will heal. This remedy is remarkably effective. </p>
<p>For corns: Mix equal parts of dried alum, yellow orpiment, and vitriol into a powder, apply it, and bathe in hot water two to three times a day to heal it. </p>
<p>In cases of nail diseases that become rotten, it may be due to nail cutting injuring the skin or the nail growing into the flesh, leading to sores and swelling. This may cause yellow fluid to soak in, resulting in the fingers becoming rotten and eventually spreading up the foot, with blisters forming around the edges, as if burned by fire, causing constant pain and being unhealable by doctors. Take five liang of green vitriol, burn it until all the liquid is gone, and grind it into a powder that is yellow in color. Store it to use, washing with salt water, and apply the powder. Wrap it gently in a soft cloth, and the very same day, it will stop the fluid and dry the sore. Do this once a day, washing with salt water, ensuring any pus is cleaned out. For areas where scabs have formed, do not disturb them unless there is urgent pain, in which case apply a little butter to soothe. After three days, you will notice the scab lifting. Continue washing and applying treatment as before, and within ten days the scabs will gradually come off. If soft areas develop more white pus blisters, break them and apply the treatment, and they will naturally heal.

<p>The soles of the feet are swollen and raised, with black sores that are hard as nails. There are small holes forming in the tibia, with marrow oozing out, and the body shivers from cold, only yearning for alcohol. This indicates issues with the liver and kidney meridians, where cold and heat are intermingled. Use powdered Aconitum or Wu Tou to apply externally, and take a drink made of chives for internal treatment, and it will be effective.</p>
<p>For sores caused by cutting nails that do not heal after several years: grind equal portions of Aconitum and Coptis into a powder, wash it and apply it to heal.</p>
<p>For knee wind causing pain: prepare a powder of Aconitum, Asarum, and Siler, mix it into shoes and knee protection, which can eliminate wind and dampness, promoting agile steps.</p>
<p>For feet swelling after a long journey: grind equal portions of Aconitum, Asarum, and Siler into a powder and mix it into the soles of the shoes. For straw sandals, slightly moisten with water and apply; using this, one can walk a thousand miles, which is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>For painful foot conditions, or lumps in the groin: make a powder from fresh Aconitum, rhubarb, and Momordica, boil in ginger juice, and combine with tea for application. Another prescription is to use only Aconitum powdered, mixed with ginger juice or wine lees to apply.</p>
<p>For damp stagnation causing foot swelling, which is lighter in the morning and heavier in the evening: take one tael of fresh Aconitum, grind it with one tael of ginger, and let it sit overnight; also take one tael of Atractylodes and grind it with one tael of green onion white, letting it sit overnight. Both should be dried, ground into powder, made into pills the size of walnuts, with each dose being fifty pills taken with wine.<a id="trans-326p" href="#orig-326p" class="marker">[326p]</a></p></div>

If there&#39;s dampness involved, additionally incorporate two qian of coix seed powder, and increase the rice to make one medium bowl. Eating this porridge greatly alleviates issues with limbs that are unresponsive or painful and unable to lift. For those with such symptoms, it is essential to take preventative measures.</p>
<p>According to Master Zuo: Wind can affect the limbs, which are referred to as the four extremities. The spleen governs the limbs, and when wind evils invade the liver, they are mischievous towards the spleen. As the spleen is subdued by the liver, the ailment manifests in the extremities. The energy from grains attracts wind and dampness, which directly enters the spleen channel, hence providing comfort to the limbs. This remedy is potent, and I have previously formulated this prescription for others, with successful results.</p>
<p>For treating lesions that do not dry: Use white chalky soil, calcined and ground into a fine powder, and mix with raw oil for application.</p>
<p>For foot lesions and ulcers: Use mud from leek earthworms, finely ground, and mix with talcum powder and clear oil for application.</p>
<p>For chronic ulcers: Use aged yellow earth from the oven, finely ground, and mix in equal parts with golden thread, red lead, and talcum powder. Adjust with clear oil and apply using silk, ensuring it remains undisturbed. Healing will occur in several days. Endure any itchiness, as it is beneficial.</p>
<p>For stubborn ulcers and ringworm: Use seven parts of verdigris, grind it, and mix with one tael of yellow wax, melting it together. Apply using thick paper soaked in the mixture, separated by another layer of paper. This will draw out moisture and is highly effective.<a id="trans-351p" href="#orig-351p" class="marker">[351p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Suwen says: In cases of liver heat disease, there is heated contention resulting in delirium and agitation, fullness and pain in the sides, restlessness in the hands and feet, unable to lie down peacefully. When severe, it leads to extreme sweating. Reversed qi can result in death. Needling the foot’s Jueyin and Shaoyang points is recommended. </p>
<p>In cases of kidney heat disease, there is initial pain in the lower back, acidity in the legs, thirst with frequent drinking, and fever. Heated contention leads to neck pain and stiffness, cold and sourness in the legs, with warmth below the feet and reluctance to speak. Reversed qi can lead to subtle neck pain. When severe, it causes extreme sweating. Needling the foot’s Shaoyin and Taiyang points is recommended.</p>
<p>In cases of fever disease, there is initial pain in the chest and sides, restlessness in the hands and feet; needling the foot’s Shaoyang and supplementing the foot&#39;s Taiyin are advised. For severe cases, fifty-nine needles are used. </p>
<p>For fever-related arm pain, needling the hand’s Yangming and Taiyin points helps to stop the sweating. </p>
<p>If the fever begins in the legs and shins, needling the foot’s Yangming point will help to stop the sweating. </p>
<p>The Lingshu Classic states: In January, February, and March, the human energy is in the left side, hence do not needle the Yang point of the left foot. In April, May, and June, the energy is in the right side, hence do not needle the Yang point of the right foot. In July, August, and September, the energy is again in the right side, hence do not needle the Yin point of the right foot.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The hand Taiyin is also called Lieque, starting at the wrist and connecting with the Taiyin channel, extending directly into the palm and dispersing into the space between the thumb and index finger. When there is excess, it manifests as sharp pain and heat in the palm; when there is deficiency, it results in frequent urination. The point is located half an inch below the wrist, connecting to the Yangming channel. </p>
<p>The hand Shaoyang is called Waiguan, located two inches above the wrist on the outer arm, leading to the chest and connecting with the heart. In cases of excess, it causes elbow stiffness; in deficiency, it results in inability to close. This point is likewise a connecting point. </p>
<p>The foot Yangming is known as Fenglong, found eight inches above the ankle, diverging from the Taiyin; its path follows the outer side of the shinbone, connecting the head, converging with the energy of various channels, and also linking to the throat. If the qi is reversed, it can cause throat obstruction and sudden loss of voice; with excess, it leads to mania, while deficiency results in inability to gather strength in the feet, causing atrophy of the shins. This point signifies a connection as well. </p>
<p>If there is pathogenic influence in the liver, there will be pain in the sides and central area, with cold symptoms, bad blood stagnating inside, leading to spasms, and occasional swelling of the feet. Treat by stimulating the Xingjian point to draw down the sides, tonifying Sanli point to warm the stomach, relieving the bad blood by accessing the blood vessels, and using the ear&#39;s lateral veins to alleviate the spasms. </p>
<p>If there are injuries with significant bleeding or if one suffers from wind-cold, leading to a sensation of falling, with laxity of the limbs, it is termed body lethargy. The treatment is to stimulate the area three inches below the navel. This area is the intersection of the Yangming and Taiyin channels, also seen as the Guanyuan point, three inches below the navel. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a sickness in one foot, apply moxibustion to that foot; if both feet are afflicted, moxibustion should be done on both. Weakness in the feet often affects both legs. Additionally, if one feels discomfort in the foot, moxibustion should be applied at three cun and at the point of the bone. For afflictions in both feet, moxibustion should be performed at four locations. The number of treatments depends on the severity of the illness; even for light ailments, do not reduce the amount below one hundred applications. If the condition does not improve, continue moxibustion in order, as more is better. Some say moxibustion at the point of the bone is particularly important. If a person has weak feet and does not treat it promptly, there may be swelling in the lower abdomen or difficulty in breathing, thus requiring the application of moxibustion to various important points and joints on the abdomen and back, along with taking Baifeng Powder; often they experience healing. If the illness is felt in the abdomen and the patient is unable to bear the pain, then instead of extensive treatment, focus moxibustion on the chest, heart, abdomen, and points on both feet, where they may also achieve good recovery. The method for measuring a person&#39;s moxibustion is to cover the hand, stretching four fingers; measure up to the middle joint, where the width becomes one unit. There are two kinds of measurements; one where three fingers count as one unit, but for weak feet, use four fingers as one unit.<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a></p></div>

Recently, those who practice moxibustion have noted that it commonly raises the Qi upward, which is why they no longer follow those methods. If the Qi does not stop, it can still be used. The key is that if a disease has already manifested and there are fears of no recovery, all must be treated with moxibustion. There are eight points on each foot, excluding the peculiarities of the toes, which Cao&#39;s school refers to as the &quot;Eight Chongs,&quot; effectively stimulating downward Qi. At the tips of the ten toes, called &quot;Qi Tips,&quot; apply moxibustion three times daily, which is a significant method. The Eight Chongs can be treated with moxibustion seven times a day, and the upward flow of Qi will then cease.<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhang Zhongwen&#39;s divine acupuncture method treats acute contractions of the foot tendons, where bending and stretching aren’t possible: burn moxa on both sides of the curved points (in autumn), around the left and right feet. Each point receives three burns, specifically at the internal and external curved intersection points. For each foot, two fires are used simultaneously, and the moxa is burned down to the flesh. Initially, pain is felt, but then two people blow until the fire goes out. Moxa is applied at noon, and once the moxa takes effect, the organs may automatically shift or rotate with a sound like thunder, leading to an immediate recovery. This method is remarkably effective and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>For the knee&#39;s tendons that cannot relax, take a point one and a half inches above the knee bend. </p>
<p>If the knee’s tendons are cramped and cannot open, take the two sharp external points of the knees and apply moxa 27 times, targeting the Weiyang point.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jingyue Complete Book&quot; states: When foot illness is first perceived, one should apply moxa 20-30 times at the affected area, or use a thunder fire needle to guide the dampness out, complemented by drinking fermented liquor to open the channels and disperse evil. This is the essential method.</p>
<p>If blockage has already formed and the evil is strong, there will be significant swelling, pain, and heat, and medicaments alone will struggle to disperse it. In such cases, it is advisable to use a lancet to remove the stasis blood to alleviate the heat and swelling, followed by medication.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidelines for Practice</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Remarkable Efficacy of Good Remedies&quot; says: To treat a sudden cramping in the foot, stretch the foot and tightly pull it forward; the pain will then cease. The &quot;Secret Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states that for numbness in the hands and feet, place the left foot on the right knee, use the right hand to pull the left foot, and support the heel with the left hand, pulling towards the right while simultaneously turning the head. Do the same for the opposite side. In addition, engage in practices that promote the circulation of energy, utilizing the tidal flow of energy. For symptoms of both qi and blood deficiency, begin at the origin point and gradually stimulate the affected area. Rotate and twist to restore proper alignment. You can practice this while sitting, standing, or lying down. Occasionally, use your nails to pinch the numb areas—this will stimulate blood flow. For wind diseases affecting hands and feet, focus on the navel and use a breathing technique, perhaps focusing on the back, and then disperse energy throughout the limbs to alleviate pain in the joints, imagining a burning sensation. For pain in the fingers, concentrate on the afflicted area, using circular motions, and further break it down to disperse the energy. For numbness in the hands and feet, focus on rotating the navel and the Qihai point, and at night, turn over to let the water nourish Kunlun. Sweating all over and healing the limbs requires diligent practice. It is beneficial to rub both feet against each other, especially at the three yin points. For weakness in the hands and feet, first focus on the navel, then move from the Yongquan point up to the navel and back down, while crossing the energy from the left hand to the right and vice versa, performing this six times each. For burning sensations in the affected areas, push and disperse the energy while imagining washing them with water.<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; states in the biography of Hua Tuo: A person, during the Qinglong period, saw the Governor of Shanyang, Liu Jingzong of Guangling. Jingzong mentioned that throughout the Zhongping era, he had met Hua Tuo several times, and that Hua Tuo&#39;s diagnosis of illnesses and his pulse examinations were as accurate as a divine revelation. </p>
<p>Liu Xun of Langye was a governor of Henei, who had a daughter nearly twenty years old. She had a sore on her left knee that was itchy but not painful. The sore would heal for several days only to reappear, this cycle continued for seven or eight years. They called in Tuo to examine her, and he said: &quot;This is easy to treat. You should acquire a yellow dog with rice husk, and two good horses. Tie the dog by the neck with a rope and let it run alongside the horses. The horses will tire quickly.&quot; </p>
<p>After running about thirty miles, the dog could not continue. They then had a person drag it for about fifty miles. Tuo then gave the girl medicine to drink, and she immediately fell asleep, unaware of her surroundings. </p>
<p>Then he took a big knife and cut the dog&#39;s belly near its hind legs, placing the cut part against the sore. He instructed them to hold it in place for two to three inches. In a moment, something resembling a snake emerged from the sore. Tuo swiftly drove an iron spike through the snake&#39;s head while it was still within the skin; it writhed for a long time before finally stopping. He then pulled it out; it was about three feet long, entirely a snake, with only eyes but no other features, and had backward scales. </p>
<p>He applied an ointment to the wound, and within seven days, it healed.<a id="trans-402p" href="#orig-402p" class="marker">[402p]</a></p></div>

Upon arriving in the capital, a clerk presented a remedy, which led to his recovery. The remedy involved crushing common purslane and applying it, only needing two or three applications.</p>
<p>The &quot;Hui Chen Lu&quot; mentions: The Yangmei of Kuaiji is the best in the world. Tong Guan suffered from athlete&#39;s foot, and some said that the kernels of Yangmei could cure it. The county magistrate, Wang Yi, gifted him fifty shi (a unit of measure), and Guan used it to achieve recovery. The kernels were prepared by mixing them with persimmon varnish, and when exposed, they cracked open naturally.</p>
<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: An elderly man, Ma Sou, aged fifty-nine, was punished with a cane for failing to pay autumn taxes, which shock led to a long-standing condition of wind-induced spasms lasting three years. His illness manifested in violent tremors of hands and feet, rendering him unable to hold objects, requiring others to feed him, with his mouth and eyes appearing dazed, and unable to control his movements, resembling a puppet on strings, drawing crowds whenever he appeared in public. At night, he experienced fever, shedding all clothing and blankets, his body sick and itchy, alternating between internal heat and external chill. He longed for death yet lacked the strength to end his life. Seeking medical help led to financial ruin, worsening his condition. His son, a former minor official in the town, carried news of his parents&#39; illness. The doctor stated: This illness is very easy to treat. During the summer heat, with a single bout of treatment, you only need to undergo it again to be cured. Now, as autumn brings chill, it should be done three times.<a id="trans-403p" href="#orig-403p" class="marker">[403p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is no improvement, further needling of the Yu point will surely bring healing. First, use the Tongsheng powder to induce sweating, then take the Yongji medicine, which will cause the expulsion of one to two liters of phlegm. By evening, another five to seven passages will be released, and the illness will be somewhat relieved. Wait five days before administering another expulsion, leading to the discharge of three to four liters of phlegm, resembling clumped chicken fat and appearing hot like soup. The elderly man, trembling and unable to probe himself, had his wife assist him; his throat and neck were swollen, and he felt dazed as if intoxicated. After about one or two hours, he gradually awakened and expelled a few more passages, immediately feeling lighter and less tremulous, with the heat also subsiding. He was able to walk again, use his hands for grooming, and handle utensils. Before the third expulsion was reached, the illness vanished as if washed away, leaving him feeling extremely cold. The physician said: He should be supplemented with food, and in time, he will recover. The reason is that after a severe illness, the defensive qi has not yet returned, thus it is advisable to use medicines that disperse wind and guide qi; one must not use warming medications, for that could lead to other ailments.</p>
<p>An elderly man from Huangru, with both hands trembling, appeared as if he were sawing; he couldn’t cover himself with a blanket in winter. While treating a patient in Wuyang, I passed through Huangru and did not apply medication but needled the middle point behind the thumbs on both hands. The physician remarked: From the elbows upward, there are no ailments, solely the trembling in the hands, which is what the leftist refers to as wind-induced minor illness. Alternatively, needling the Houbie point, which corresponds to the hand&#39;s Taiyang point, and bending the little finger to where the lines converge is also a significant point.<a id="trans-404p" href="#orig-404p" class="marker">[404p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young boy from the Li family suffered from spasms in his hands and feet, signifying the influence of a spirit. The spirit said: &quot;This is caused by excessive heart fire; do not restrain his hands. He should go through the spasms.&quot; This was due to the nurse&#39;s improper cradling. They then cleaned the ground, sprinkled it with water, and re-sprinkled it until it was thoroughly wet, placing the child face down on the ground for a long time. The child turned and rolled, getting completely muddy, and they washed him with water. After a while, he was cured.</p>
<p>Another patient, a tax official, experienced pain from wind, cold, and dampness, feeling heavy and swollen in the waist and legs, suffering greatly at night. His feet were unbearably cold, and for five to six months, he still wore cotton socks. The skin on his knees and feet was minimally exposed; when cold wind touched it, it penetrated his meridians, worsening his condition, with pain fluctuating and shifting unpredictably. In the area of greatest pain, there would be spasms and swelling, but the flesh color remained unchanged, with the skin feeling like it had bugs crawling beneath it. Whenever exposed to wind and cold, his illness would surely worsen. His appetite decreased, and his body became weak and thin, requiring assistance to walk or stand. He had taken various warming herbs and moxibustion, but to no avail for three years.</p>
<p>One day, I examined his pulse; both hands were heavy, slippery, and strong. I first administered one dose each of Water Conduit Pill and Meridian Passage Powder. That night, he had over thirty bowel movements, and his pain was reduced by half. Gradually, he took Red Poria Decoction, Chuanxiong Decoction, and Fangfeng Decoction, which are prescribed in the &quot;Xuanming Lun&quot; for treating bi syndrome. He took these three remedies three times a day, boiled at seven to eight qian, and soon began to sweat lightly. Following that, through a process of steam treatment using a delicate stove, he was cured.<a id="trans-405p" href="#orig-405p" class="marker">[405p]</a></p></div>

They itched, causing him to scratch them open; when water touched them, they became soaked and resembled insects crawling on socks. Even after healing, they would recur, leaving pits as scars, and for over ten years, he could not recover. A certain physician remarked, saying: &quot;These are damp sores. They arise from moisture, hence they are often found on the lower parts of the body. With boats and carts, one travels over ten miles, and it&#39;s as if they have been swept away.&quot;</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongwen, the liquor supervisor from Guyang Town, visited a temple and noticed that the workman had built a lookout platform about four feet high. While climbing down, he twisted one foot, causing swelling around the outer ankle, with a heat and pain like fire. One doctor intended to use a needle (gold not being suitable) to prick the swollen area to release blood. But another physician urgently stopped him, saying: &quot;The pain from the twist is already severe; to inflict a needle prick would cause double the pain. How can one endure that?&quot; Hence, he administered Shenyou pills, around eighty or ninety, and instructed him to abstain from hot foods. </p>
<p>At midnight, the swollen area became itchy, the pain subsided, and he could walk normally again. The physician said: &quot;My method has healed all ten cases, I do not deceive future generations.&quot;<a id="trans-406p" href="#orig-406p" class="marker">[406p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhongming&#39;s wife, whenever winter comes, experiences a burning pain in her hands. A physician said: &quot;The limbs are the foundation of all Yang energy. In summer, they disperse and there&#39;s no pain, but when autumn and winter arrive, they contract and thus cause pain.&quot; He treated her with the Sanhua Shen&#39;you pill and she was cured.</p>
<p>In Yancheng, there lived a man named Liang Jia, who was over sixty. One morning, he woke up and began to comb his hair, only to find that the fingers of his left hand were numb. Soon, half of his arm became numb, then the other arm, and shortly after, the upper half of his head. By the time he finished combing, he felt numbness from his side down to his feet. He hadn’t had a proper bowel movement for two or three days. He consulted other doctors, who all said it was due to wind; whether through medicine or acupuncture, none provided relief, so he sought treatment from the physician. </p>
<p>The physician examined him and said: &quot;The three pulse points in your left arm are faint, being three times smaller than those of your right. This is not merely due to wind; there is also a combination of dryness caused by heat.&quot; He prescribed methods of expelling along with purging and sweating, and the numbness immediately subsided. Later, he used warm and moistening medications to treat the dryness, but the little and ring fingers remained numb. The physician said: &quot;The root of the illness is gone; this is just residual heat.&quot; Only then was it appropriate to perform acupuncture at the Xigu point, which is the space of the bones. </p>
<p>On a sunny and mild day, he went to perform the acupuncture, using the technique from the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; involving the chicken foot method—he inserted the needle while the patient was lying upward, applying it three times, then withdrew it and inserted it while lying downward. The numbness throughout the fingers was relieved, and the hand felt as hot as fire. The numbness completely disappeared. In the past, Liu Hejian wrote the &quot;Yuan Bing Shi,&quot; often associating numbness with dryness, truly a connoisseur of understanding ailments.<a id="trans-407p" href="#orig-407p" class="marker">[407p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Ma&#39;s brother was bitten by a dog while in the village. He was carried home, and his leg swelled up like a jar, as hard as iron or stone. Poison entered, causing him to vomit and preventing food from staying down, along with a heavy headache. He went to consult a healer. The young maid said, &quot;The pain follows the reduction in benefits; use betel nut pills to expel it.&quot; There were two excretions, but it did not improve. Just then, the healer returned from Wuyang and said to Ma, &quot;With such swelling, can the three yin and three yang of the foot be unblocked?&quot; Ma replied, &quot;Neither can be unblocked.&quot; The healer asked, &quot;Then why not use a strong purge?&quot; He ordered that night to take one hundred and fifty pills of Zhuoche, along with three or four qian of Tongjing San. By midnight, there were fourteen excretions, and the swelling immediately subsided, leaving a walnut-patterned skin, even thinner than the uninjured leg. The healer cautioned, &quot;Be careful not to apply a plaster, as it must allow the poisoned fluids to flow out; the purulent blood and water should continue to move.&quot; Another day, fearing the poison had not yet fully dissipated, he took over a hundred more pills of Zhuoche, along with three or four qian of Junchuan San, resulting in six excretions. The patient said, &quot;Fourteen excretions are easy to manage, but six are unexpectedly difficult; why is this?&quot; The healer replied, &quot;When the illness is severe, it overcomes the medicine; when the illness is milder, it cannot withstand the medicine.&quot; On the sixth day, the purulent water was completely gone. The healer stated, &quot;While the purulent water flows, do not fear the wind; after it is gone, fear the wind.&quot; He then used a wind-canceling cake, taking it three times a day. After another two days, he finally applied a wound-healing powder, and it formed a scab. Alas! The use of medicine varies and makes a significant difference. If he had not seen the healer, the advice on reduction of benefits would not have been accurate.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ten Books of the Eastern Garden&quot; states: In the winter of the Gui Mao year, during heavy snowfall, Dong Jianjun from Ling Shou County went to Zhen Ding for some affairs and suddenly felt a strong wind blowing. Upon examination, he found all six pulse positions to be taut, and pressing revealed a strong and forceful pulse. The symptoms included sudden spasms of the hands, constipation, and a red, hot face, indicating an onset of wind-cold attacking the body. The four limbs correlate with the spleen; if wind and cold evil affect it, then there will be spasms and pain, showing that wind is the superficial ailment while cold exists on the exterior. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that cold causes muscle contractions, which directly relates to this situation. The patient, who regularly drank alcohol, had damp heat accumulating in his intestines and stomach, leading to constipation and a red, hot face. Internally, the hands and feet are afflicted by Yangming (the Yangming meridian), while externally, the Taiyin spleen meridian is suffering from the wind-cold evil. Therefore, I used cinnamon and licorice to expel the cold evil and ease the spasms. Also, using the bitter and cold properties of bitter coptis to purge heat and moisten dryness, I urgently rescued the kidney water. I applied angelica and kudzu to uplift Yang energy and mobilize the meridians of the hands and feet without obstruction. Additionally, I used cinnamon, which is spicy and warm, to guide into the hand Yangming meridian. To replenish the spleen&#39;s energy and prevent the invasion of wind-cold, I added peony and licorice specifically to nourish the spleen’s Qi, thus suppressing the wood evil and benefiting the lung&#39;s metal. I included ginseng to boost the innate Qi as an auxiliary treatment, along with angelica to relieve internal urgency while harmonizing the blood and moistening dryness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the spring of the Year of the Snake, when Lian Pingzhang was thirty-eight years old, he suffered from a condition marked by body and limbs swelling slightly with redness. His feet and shins were red and swollen, causing unbearable pain. He did not dare lean on a walking stick; when he touched his skin, the pain intensified. He would rise only to lie back down, struggling day and night, unable to describe his suffering, and sought my treatment.</p>
<p>Due to the high, cold northern lands, he had consumed much alcohol over time, damaging his spleen and hindering its ability to process food and drink, resulting in this condition. I prescribed him a decoction of Angelica to relieve pain, and his pain was reduced by half. After a second dose, the swelling and pain completely disappeared, leaving only slight redness and swelling in the tips of his right-hand fingers. I used a three-edged needle to prick the tips of his fingers, and much vile blood was released, fully eliminating the redness and swelling. </p>
<p>A few days later, after eating moist food, he experienced pain in his limbs again, so I treated him with a decoction of bitter orange and rhubarb. The ailment, foot edema, is caused by excessive water and dampness. The face gathers this dampness, obstructing the blood&#39;s circulation and resulting in aching limbs and joints. The Inner Canon states: wind can overcome dampness. Qianghuo, being aromatic and warm, penetrates the joints to expel dampness, hence it is used primarily. When blood stagnates and cannot flow, pain ensues, and Angelica&#39;s warming qualities disperse the obstruction and alleviate pain. The bitter and cold nature of bitter orange treats distention and aids in digestion, thus it serves as an adjunct. Rhubarb, being bitter and cold, guides out the damp heat from the face and treats all accumulated blood clots, acting decisively, which is why it is included as an envoy in this formulation.<a id="trans-413p" href="#orig-413p" class="marker">[413p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Hygienic Treasure&quot; states: Zhang Danian from Zhen Ding Prefecture, at the age of twenty-nine, had a strong fondness for alcohol. During the fifth month of the year Xinyi (the 13th year of the Yuan dynasty), he suffered from swelling and pain in his finger joints, making flexion and extension difficult; his knees were similarly affected. He felt a fullness in his chest, a heaviness throughout his body, a lack of desire to eat, and when he did eat, he felt the urge to vomit. His complexion was pale yellow, and his energy was diminished. In June, he came seeking treatment from me. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be deep and slow; a slow pulse indicates spleen issue. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that the body is heavy with joint pain. The spleen governs the arms and legs; due to his long history of drinking, combined with the current excessive dampness, the moisture flowed to his limbs, causing the swelling and pain. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all dampness causing swelling and pain is related to the spleen soil. Zhong Jing mentions: “When dampness flows into the joints, the limbs become painful”—this refers to that situation. He should be treated with the major Qianghuo Decoction. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; further states: &quot;When dampness lingers internally, treat with bitter warmth, disperse it with bitterness and drain it with lightness.&quot; It also says: &quot;Wind can overcome dampness.&quot; Qianghuo and Duhuo are spicy and warm, penetrating the joints to overcome dampness, thus they are the monarch herbs. Shengma is bitter and neutral; Weilingxian, Fangfeng, and Cangzhu are bitter, spicy, and warm, making them dispersing ministers. If blood is stagnant and not flowing, add Danggui, which is spicy and warm to disperse it. Licorice is sweet and warm, benefiting qi and warming the center; Zexie is salty and neutral, Fuling is sweet and neutral, guiding dampness and benefiting urination, thus draining it with lightness. This harmonizes the flavors, allowing for dispersion of dampness both upwards and downwards.<a id="trans-415p" href="#orig-415p" class="marker">[415p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhongshu Nianhe was forty years old, sturdy in build. In the spring of the year of Bingchen, he journeyed to the eastern part of Yangzhou. Suddenly, he experienced a surge of symptoms in his feet, with swelling throughout his body, causing pain so severe that he could not approach them. The pain in his legs was especially intense, making it impossible for him to wear shoes. He rode on horseback with his feet barely resting in the stirrups, using a bamboo container to manage the situation, and urgently came to seek help.</p>
<p>I recalled that the &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;Dampness begins within and manifests as swelling outside.&quot; Furthermore, it says: &quot;All pains are due to excess.&quot; If the blood is excessive, it should be drained. I used a three-edged needle to pierce the swollen area several times, and blood gushed out, rising more than two feet, gradually flowing out like a thread, totaling about half a liter, with a purple-black color. Shortly after, the swelling subsided and the pain decreased. I prescribed a dose of Danggui Nian Tong decoction, weighing about one and a half liang, for him to take. That night, he was able to sleep, and after taking it again the next day, he was cured. &quot;Bencao&quot; mentions that certain treatments can dispel obstruction and promote flow.

Fangfeng and licorice warm and scatter the dampness flowing in the meridians, thus they are used as the main herbs.

Baizhu is bitter, sweet, and warm, harmonizing the stomach and overpowering dampness. Cangzhu is light and buoyant, with a strong energy that can eliminate dampness from the skin and pores, thus it is used as an assistant. When the blood is stagnant and not flowing, it causes pain; Danggui is warm and pungent, dispersing it to ensure that blood and qi return to their proper places. Renshen and licorice are sweet and warm, tonifying the spleen and stomach, nurturing the righteous qi so that bitter medications do not harm the stomach. Zhòngjīng says that when dampness and heat combine, the limbs and joints experience pain. Ku Shen, Huangqin, Zhim mu, and Yinchén are bitter and cold, serving to drain excess. All are prepared and stir-fried for use. If treatment does not facilitate urination, it is not effective. Zhū líng is sweet, warm, and neutral, while Zexie is salty and neutral, mild enough to promote diuresis and also capable of guiding out retained fluids, thus they are used as aids.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Deputy Marshal of Southern Expeditions, Da Te Mu Er, was sixty-eight years old. In the autumn of the Wuxu year, I accompanied him on a campaign southward. Passing ten miles beyond Yangzhou, it was mid-winter, and I fell ill. My digestion was poor, my abdomen was cold and painful, my lower legs felt icy, and I could not feel any pain or itch when I scratched myself. I attempted to warm myself by burning stones, but it did not help. I examined my pulse, which was deep, thin, and weak. Considering my condition, I realized that at such an advanced age and with a weak constitution, entering enemy territory, facing the urgent demands of warfare, along with the cold of night and day, disrupted eating habits and excessive consumption of dairy products had weakened my vitality. Walking on damp ground had allowed cold and dampness to invade my body, leading to my discomfort. The “Inner Canon” states: When afflicted by cold, one may experience mild symptoms such as a cough, or more severe manifestations like diarrhea and pain. This results from a combination of cold and dampness causing illness. Therefore, the proper course of action is to quickly dispel the cold and dampness, and strongly invigorate the Yang energy; moxibustion is necessary to remedy the illness. First, I applied moxa sticks to the Qi Hai point, doing it a hundred times to bolster the Yang energy in the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-418p" href="#orig-418p" class="marker">[418p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For the treatment of coldness in the knee and its reversal, and to guide the yang energy downward, moxibustion is applied to the three miles and two points, each with three seven-sticks. Additionally, moxibustion is used on the three yin junctions to dispel the cold and dampness affecting the feet. Therefore, the prescription states that cold invasion should be treated with warming, pungent herbs, while exterior dampness should be addressed with bitter and hot herbs, which are released by bitterness.</p>
<p>For this, Aconite is the chief herb, being greatly warming and pungent, aiding yang and dispelling yin, warming the meridians and scattering cold. Dried Ginger and Cinnamon are also highly warming and pungent, dispelling cold dampness; White Atractylodes and Pinellia are bitter, pungent, warm, and dry dampness from the spleen, thus they serve as deputies. Ginseng, Cardamom, and roasted Licorice are sweet and pungent, greatly warming, nourishing the middle and benefiting qi; Fresh Ginger is pungent and warm, dispelling the clear dampness; Green Onions are pungent and warm, facilitating the upward flow of yang energy, thus they serve as assistants.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is said: to nourish and treat descending issues should be done urgently; when urgent, the flavor of the remedy is rich, hence a substantial dose should be taken. After several doses, the diarrhea stops and the pain diminishes, the knee gradually warms, and dietary adjustments are made, stabilizing by over ten days. The following autumn, while passing through Xiangyang, amidst a prolonged rainy season, the previous symptoms reoccurred. Again, moxibustion was done as before and additional yang-supporting treatments were administered with three seven-sticks each. After several doses of the previous remedy, a good recovery was achieved.<a id="trans-419p" href="#orig-419p" class="marker">[419p]</a></p></div>

However, the next day, the nausea worsened significantly, accompanied by diarrhea, cold pain in the navel and abdomen, a feeling of fullness, reduced appetite, and occasional dizziness. Over the dark area beneath the left breast, I performed moxibustion for two or seven times and used Tuo Li Wen Zhong Tang, which included dried ginger, aconite, wood fragrance, sandalwood, fennel, and Qianghuo, grinding one and a half taels for administration.<a id="trans-420p" href="#orig-420p" class="marker">[420p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers relate to heart fire, especially during times of intense heat. Can dry ginger and aconite be used then? I responded: It is only natural; it must be so. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: If the pulse is fine and the skin is cold, with diarrhea before and after, and food does not enter, this is called the five vacuities. Moreover, if one consumes counterproductive foods, it is due to the stomach being vacuous and cold. All pains, itching, sores, and ulcers belong to heart fire, which explains the diagnosis. This condition contradicts internal and external signs; therefore, one must follow the signs rather than the time. If not treated urgently with strong, hot formulas, it cannot be cured. Thus, after administering the treatment, all symptoms disappeared, appetite doubled, the sores were warm, and the pus was normal. Yan He again used the Five Spice Decoction several times, and after more than a month, recovery was achieved. Ah! Sticking to the usual is the perspective of the common people, while understanding change is the work of the wise.

Later, a mountain man named Deng Si Ji learned of it and recorded the method, stating: Harvest the herb, dry it in the shade for over a month, pound and sieve it, then mix two qian with warm clear wine, taking it on an empty stomach. If the person’s natural constitution is strong against the medicine, the dosage can be increased to six qian. If the purging effect becomes too strong, reduce the dosage, and stop taking it once the illness is cured.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man with weak vital energy often experienced dizziness, fatigue, and heat in his limbs. In the midsummer, due to labor and irregular diet, he suffered from numbness in his hands and overall weakness. I believed that the summer heat had harmed his vital energy, so I treated him with a ginseng tonifying decoction, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Governor Han Tingyi initially suffered from wind symptoms, which improved with medications that dispelled wind, transformed phlegm, and nourished blood. However, he later experienced heat and pain in the bones of his legs and knees, and after taking the Shimei Guben Pills and Tianma Pills, his condition worsened. His pulse was rapid but weak. I deduced that his kidney water was deficient and could not nourish the liver wood, causing internal heat to arise, and this was not caused by external wind. Doubting my diagnosis, he took wind-dispelling pills like Qianghuo Yufeng Dan, which left him with weak limbs, widespread numbness, and phlegm rising, clouding his mind. I stated that his spleen energy was depleted, unable to nourish his entire body and failing to regulate the phlegm. I first administered several doses of the Six Gentlemen Decoction augmented with Chuanxiong, Angelica, and cardamom to strengthen his spleen energy and regulate phlegm. Then I provided several doses of the Eight Treasure Decoction to support the transformative energy of the five organs and nourish his entire body, and gradually his symptoms improved. He then took the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction in the morning to tonify the spleen and lungs, and the Liuwei Dihuang Pills in the evening to nourish the liver and kidneys. After about three months of this regimen, he was stable.<a id="trans-426p" href="#orig-426p" class="marker">[426p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Madam Jin, the elder, initially experienced chest and side pain, followed by an inability to control her limbs, sweating profusely, involuntary urination, and unformed stools. Her mouth was tight and her eyes twitched, while her appetite was relatively good. After more than ten days, some suspected it was an issue with her internal organs, causing great worry. I said: Not so. If the wind had indeed entered the internal organs, and the true qi had already been depleted, severe symptoms would have manifested immediately, and disaster would have been at hand. How could one delay it? </p>
<p>I examined her complexion; her face was both red and sometimes blue. Upon checking her pulse, the left three positions were surging and rapid, especially the liver position was most pronounced. I stated: The chest and breast pain indicates a deficiency of blood in the liver meridian, leading to stagnant liver qi. The inability to control the limbs is due to the liver&#39;s blood deficiency, which cannot nourish the sinews. The persistent sweating indicates wind-heat in the liver, causing erratic fluid loss. The involuntary urination results from extreme heat in the liver meridian, leading to failure in the function of the yin. The unformed stools reflect a fierce liver wood overpowering the spleen earth. </p>
<p>I then administered four doses of Xijiao San, and all symptoms improved immediately. I also used jiawei xiaoyao san (modified_free_and_easy_pill) to regulate and stabilize her condition. Later, due to frustration and anxiety, her previous symptoms recurred, accompanied by fever and vomiting, a reduced appetite, and persistent menstruation. This indicated that wood was overly vigorous, constraining the earth, which prevented the spleen from retaining blood. I utilized jiawei guipi tang (modified return-to-spleen decoction) as the main remedy, supplemented with xiaoyao san, to regulate and replenish the qi of the liver and spleen, purifying and harmonizing the blood of the liver and spleen, leading to her recovery. Subsequently, whenever she was angered or during her sleep, she experienced spasms in her hands and feet, and upon using the previous remedies, she would recover immediately.<a id="trans-427p" href="#orig-427p" class="marker">[427p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had an overdue menstruation, and due to excessive labor and anger, her limbs could not bend, a condition called &quot;Zou Zheng.&quot; This was due to blood deficiency being attacked by wind and heat. She was first treated with Ba Zhen Tang, adding Diao Teng Gou and Chai Hu, which gradually improved her condition. She was further assisted with Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, which helped her recover.</p>
<p>The Minister Liu Ziyan, due to overwork, suffered from softness and pain in the lower body, along with heat and phlegm accumulation. He took Qing Zao Tang with Zhu Li and ginger juice, which reduced his heat and pain by half. After another dose, he fully recovered.</p>
<p>My teacher, Yu Xian Gao, returned from Datong and said to me: &quot;I have developed a wind disease.&quot; His legs felt weak and lacked strength, and labor caused sharp pains like iron needles, with a pulse that was strong and rapid. I informed him that this was due to liver and kidney yin deficiency with excessive fire. The weakness and lack of strength were signs of true illness, while the piercing pain was a manifestation of pathogenic fire. He was treated with a remedy to strengthen water and nourish the kidneys, leading to recovery. The gentleman remarked: &quot;While residing in the government residence, everyone believed it was wind, regretting the lack of medicine. If I had taken wind remedies, how could it be this way? How fortunate I am.&quot; I secretly believe that previous cases were often misdiagnosed as wind diseases, and hastily treating them with dispersing methods often worsened critical situations.<a id="trans-428p" href="#orig-428p" class="marker">[428p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman with a history of blood deficiency, after great labor, experienced heat in her legs and afternoon fever, with a delayed menstrual period. She sometimes used Si Wu (Four Substance Decoction), Qin (Scutellaria), and Lian (Coptis), and had little appetite with thoughts about food. She had a feeling of fullness in her chest and was vomiting phlegm, for which I advised Er Chen (Two Aged) Decoction, along with zhishi (bitter orange) and huanglian (Coptis). Her bowel movements were not firm, and she was vomiting phlegm excessively, with pain in her heels. I said: the heat in the legs and afternoon fever, along with the delayed menstrual period, indicate deficieny in both liver and spleen blood. The chest fullness and phlegm, along with lack of appetite, suggest deficiency in spleen and stomach qi. The stomach is the foundation of the five organs; when its qi is deficient, all diseases manifest. I first used Bu Zhong Yi Qi (Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi) with addition of Fu Ling (Poria) and Ban Xia (Pinellia), gradually strengthening her spleen and stomach, and then added Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavors Rehmannia Pill) to nourish the spleen and kidney. Within two months, she recovered.</p>
<p>A man had weakness and softness in his legs, with afternoon fever. I said: this is due to deficiency in the three yin of the legs, and he should take Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Zi Shen Er Wan (Two Pills for Kidney Nourishment) to nourish it. A woman had weakness in her legs and fatigue when laboring. I said: the limbs are related to earth, and this indicates spleen deficiency. She should take Bu Zhong Yi Qi and the Yao Shao Dan (Youth Preservation Pill) to manage it. None followed my advice, each insisting on using Sou Feng (Searching Wind) and Tian Ma (Gastrodia) pills, and both ended up failing.<a id="trans-429p" href="#orig-429p" class="marker">[429p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I have always enjoyed sitting and reading, but after a long time I feel weary. I must take supplements to replenish my energy, adding wheat gluten and five flavors, with a little bit of wine-fried black yellowbark, before I feel mentally clear and proper. Otherwise, I will have trouble sleeping at night, my feet feel sour and hot, and if I cannot sleep for a long time, my legs feel the same. Additionally, the muscles in my legs seem to tighten, causing them to move restlessly left and right, turning in discomfort. I will only fall asleep when exhaustion finally overcomes me, which harms my vital energy and allows Yin fire to invade. </p>
<p>In the year Ding You, at the age of fifty-one, there was a feeling of something stuck between my teeth, causing swelling and discomfort. At times, my tongue would feel as if there were sores. This condition worsened in the afternoons, and if I slept for a long time or took previous medicine, I might find some relief. By the time of Xin Chou, at age fifty-five, the swelling continued between my teeth during the day. After taking a dose of the energy-replenishing supplement, I was able to sleep at night. However, in the year Ren Yin, there were internal troubles, and although I took the previous medicine, the swelling still occurred at night, particularly worsening before noon, when my teeth and body felt somewhat healthier. In the afternoon, however, the swelling returned, indicating that my blood and energy were declining and that the treatment needed to be adjusted.</p>
<p>A scholar who enjoyed consuming excessively hot foods and drinks throughout the four seasons, sometimes experienced sour belching or inconsistent stools, and had itching between his toes. This indicated a deficiency of the spleen and a cold sinking condition, which was treated successfully with a modified Six Gentlemen Decoction adding ginger and cinnamon. If there were any minor missteps in diet, the ailments would recur. With additional doses of the previous medicine along with a little aconite, the problems would not arise again.<a id="trans-430p" href="#orig-430p" class="marker">[430p]</a></p></div>

He then tried the Four Substances Decoction along with other herbs, resulting in chest fullness, loss of appetite, excessive sweating, and a confused mind. I observed that his heavy sweating had depleted his Yang energy, leaving his spirit unanchored. Therefore, I prescribed five qian each of ginseng and astragalus, three qian each of rehmannia and atractylodes, and one qian each of polygala, tuckahoe, sour jujube seed, and honey-fried licorice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li Beixi, a major official, suffered from redness and pain in his left foot. This foot was afflicted by damp heat descending from the three yang meridians. First, garlic paste was applied for moxibustion, and after taking a dose of Huoming Decoction, the pain stopped immediately. Water oozed from the moxibustion site, and the redness and swelling subsided. Next, he took four doses of Tuoli Baidu Powder, and pus emerged from the affected area, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Scholar Yang Juyuan had a problem with his foot that was slightly swollen, painful, and mildly red. This condition stemmed from yin deficiency and damp heat descending from the three yin meridians. Moxibustion with garlic paste and the use of Tuoli Powder prompted hair growth. After taking Shiquan Dabu Decoction, pus formed, and he was further treated with the modified Eight Flavor Pill, consuming over a hundred doses until the condition resolved.</p>
<p>Another scholar experienced swelling and hardness in his foot, which had been ongoing for over two months. The condition resulted from deficiency in the three yin meridians being invaded by external cold. He used Da Fangfeng Decoction and Shiquan Dabu Decoction simultaneously to reduce the swelling. Later, after suffering from dietary issues and fatigue due to environmental factors, the initial symptoms reappeared alongside night sweats, internal heat, indigestion, and weight loss. This indicated that his spleen was deficient and cold, unable to generate fire in the life gate. He took over a hundred doses of the Eight Flavor Pill and Yiqi Decoction, benefiting from his youth, and ultimately recovered.</p>
<p>A man reported feeling heat in the soles of his feet and experienced thirst that led him to drink excessively. He was treated with Siwu Decoction, Poria, Lianhua, Huangbai, and Zhimu, along with symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, irritability, and extreme thirst. This situation indicated depletion of the three yin. The previous medications harmed his spleen and stomach; therefore, he first took several doses of Liu Junzi Decoction with roasted ginger to awaken the spleen and stomach, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction enhanced with Poria and Banxia to strengthen them. Eventually, he took the modified Eight Flavor Pill alongside for half a year until he recovered.<a id="trans-435p" href="#orig-435p" class="marker">[435p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A Confucian scholar felt a burning and itching sensation in the soles of his feet. He soaked them in hot soup, which caused discharge of water, and his body became weak and trembled, feeling thirsty and coughing up phlegm. This was due to deficiency in the spleen and kidneys leading to phlegm accumulation. After taking vitality tonic and Six Flavor Rehmannia decoction for more than nine years, his vital energy was restored and all symptoms improved.</p>
<p>The young Zongbo observed that Dongjiang appeared thirsty. I said: This is due to deficiency in the kidney channel; nourishment should be provided to the source to prevent future problems. Although he acknowledged this, he ultimately did not take the remedy. In September of the following year, the left foot developed a sore with a dark color and no pain, and the leg felt heavy. After applying garlic for more than thirty treatments, the foot and leg became lighter, the sore bled and released water, and within a few days it subsided, but the sore remained dark. At that time, he planned to travel north to celebrate a long life. I diagnosed him and said: The spleen pulse is weak, and the yang energy is extremely deficient; it is not suitable for long journeys. He replied: I have often dreamed that many immortals await me; this is a sign of longevity. Upon reaching the Hejian post, he was critically ill. He sighed and said: Can sitting in meditation keep me here? Ultimately, he passed away there; it was indeed a different fate.</p>
<p>A person had a finger on his foot affected by gangrene, with burning pain, redness, and heat. After applying garlic, he took the detoxifying powder from ginseng, adding platycodon, honeysuckle, angelica dahurica, and rhubarb in two doses to stop the pain. Then, he took the Ten Xuan Powder without platycodon and guanggui, adding tianhuafen and honeysuckle in several doses until he recovered.<a id="trans-436p" href="#orig-436p" class="marker">[436p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man over forty years old had a red, swollen, and painful large toe on his left foot. This was due to accumulated toxins in the spleen channel, termed &quot;jie ju&quot; (a type of ulcer). The symptoms included redness and swelling. The treatment involved the use of a formula that included Ren Shen (ginseng) and Bai Zhi (angelica dahurica), with an addition of Jin Yin Hua (honeysuckle) and Da Huang (rhubarb). After administering four doses, another formula with Jin Yin Hua, Gan Cao (licorice), and other herbs helped alleviate the condition; subsequently, a remedy was given that included Gui (cassia) and additional herbs. The patient recovered.</p>
<p>Another individual had a toe with &quot;jie ju&quot; that showed purple-red discoloration but was not painful. After receiving over fifty moxibustion treatments with garlic, there was still no pain. Eventually, a hundred moxibustion applications initiated pain, and four doses of &quot;Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin&quot; (a famous remedy) were administered, leading to a discharge and subsequent recovery.</p>
<p>A man over fifty years old with a diet rich in fat also suffered from &quot;jie ju,&quot; displaying a purple-black color and swelling in his foot. Master Sun stated: &quot;For this condition, immediate amputation is necessary, as toxins may spread to the abdomen and become untreatable. If the color is black and there is no pain, it is also untreatable.&quot; The patient, however, maintained his usual appetite and showed signs of being in good health, which indicated a treatable ulcer. Therefore, six doses of Lian Qiao Bai Du San (a detoxifying formula) were given, supplemented with over twenty doses of Jin Yin Hua and Gan Cao. The affected toe eventually burst and discharged. Further treatment included a combination of herbs such as Xiong, Gui, Sheng Di, Lian Qiao, Jin Yin Hua, and Bai Zhi, which led to recovery. The following year, he suddenly experienced thirst, and I treated him with &quot;Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan&quot; (an eight-flavor pill), but he did not comply. He took Sheng Jin and other medicines, which worsened his condition, and eventually stopped after taking the eight-flavor pill.<a id="trans-437p" href="#orig-437p" class="marker">[437p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A patient had a sore on the left toe, which was numb and red. The next day, the toe turned black, and in five days, the entire foot became black and cold, with no sensation of pain and a deep, thin pulse. This was due to the spleen and stomach being poisoned, so I administered a dose of the Flying Dragon Death-Seizing Pill. The next day, I instructed to cut away the dead black flesh on the foot; after the cut, the bone began to ache, which could be treated using the Complete Vitality Soup, leading to recovery. The dead flesh was the result of heavy toxic Qi obstructing the nourishing Qi. Moreover, when it reaches the depths of Yin, blood and Qi have difficulty circulating. The classics say that the induced wind leads to late-stage illnesses. If one were to attack aggressively, the evil Qi would exploit the vulnerability, making recovery impossible.</p>
<p>Another patient had a sore on the toe with black coloration and no pain. I instructed him to apply moxibustion intensely for over thirty sessions, resulting in pain, while he retained a good appetite. I advised urgent amputation and the prompt intake of tonics, but he did not believe me and delayed, ultimately leading to irreparable damage.</p>
<p>A different patient had a sore on the toe that appeared red, painful, and caused intense thirst.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman over forty years old recently developed a toxin due to a ringworm infection. Her pulse was deep and tight, and she could not extend her legs. The classics state: &quot;Spleen cold shifts to the liver, causing abscess and muscle spasms.&quot; The spleen governs flesh, while the liver governs tendons; when flesh is warm, tendons relax, and when flesh is cold, tendons become tense. Therefore, I prescribed Ruxiang Dingtong Pills, which provided slight relief. I then administered over twenty doses of medicines to aid the stomach and boost qi and blood, leading to a cure.</p>
<p>Wang Ruda experienced redness and swelling in his knees and legs, with pain in his bones. After taking Shixuan Powder, he showed no improvement. Upon examining his pulse, which was deep and thin, I prescribed two doses of Wujia Powder, which stopped the pain. Then, I gave him Shixuan Powder with the addition of Jiujing (Achyranthes) and Duzhong (Eucommia) for over thirty doses, resulting in purulence and recovery. This swelling was due to cold qi and the changes caused by the eight winds.</p>
<p>A man suffered from gangrene on his toe, with severe pain and redness. I instructed to apply moxibustion with garlic until the pain subsided. I prescribed Ren Shen Bai Du San, adding Jie Geng (Platycodon) and Jin Yin Hua (Honeysuckle), along with Bai Zhi (Angelica), and Da Huang (Rhubarb) for it to erupt, followed by Xianfang Huo Ming Yin for a cure. Although this condition was small in outward appearance, it had severe consequences, necessitating moxibustion with garlic. For those who did not feel pain, direct moxibustion was recommended to reduce the toxicity.</p>
<p>A man experienced gangrene on the back of his foot, exhibiting redness, swelling, and pain. I advised applying moxibustion with garlic over thirty times until the pain ceased, followed by four doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Yin, resulting in eruption, and thereafter used medicines to purge toxins for recovery.</p>
<p>Another man had gangrene on his toe, which was red, painful, and made him thirsty.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from gangrene on the dorsum of his foot; it was dark in color but neither swollen nor painful. He was restless and extremely thirsty, with a large and weak pulse. This indicated that his vital energy had already been exhausted and that treatment would be futile. Eventually, he passed away.</p>
<p>A woman injured her index finger while doing her nails, which became pus-filled but would not burst. She experienced extreme pain up to her hand, applying cold medicine, which led to swelling extending to her wrist, along with mild nausea and reduced appetite. She believed it to be an internal attack of toxic energy. Upon examining her pulse, which was deep and thin, I determined that this pain stemmed from damage to her stomach&#39;s energy, and proceeded with acupuncture. I prescribed the Six Gentlemen Decoction with additions of patchouli and angelica, after which her appetite improved; later, I gave her the Eight Treasures Decoction with added astragalus, white atractylodes, and platycodon. She recovered in over a month.</p>
<p>A young girl suffered frostbite on both feet, leading to ulcers in spring, resulting in the loss of her toes. She took fortifying medicine and recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had an ingrown toenail on her finger for over a year without healing; she drained several drops of pus daily. I indicated that the big toe is the source of the liver and spleen meridians and recommended moxibustion at the affected area to eliminate the stagnant flesh, allowing the yang energy to reach it, so that the wound would heal naturally; otherwise, it would not heal. She neglected this advice and did not seek early treatment, later developing a debilitating condition and ultimately passed away. This condition, often encountered in women, frequently arises from tight bindings that obstruct the blood vessels or from being assaulted by wind pathogens, resulting in a lack of blood and energy nourishment, ultimately leading to necrotic tissue. The appropriate treatment required strengthening the spleen and stomach, promoting circulation of energy, and generating blood to achieve recovery. </p>
<p>For those with tetanus leading to a tight jaw and facial asymmetry, it is advisable to first administer the Yuzhen Powder for one or two doses, and then use agents that generate blood and promote circulation for better outcomes.<a id="trans-440p" href="#orig-440p" class="marker">[440p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had an injury on his toe, which was black, not painful, and about to fall off. I said: This is because the yang energy is weak and cannot reach the affected area. It must be removed urgently, and one should hastily take tonics to strengthen the original energy; otherwise, dead flesh will extend to the foot, and it cannot be saved. If one does not believe, the blackened area will indeed rot up the leg and lead to death. Generally, on the hands and feet, where vital energy and blood rarely reach, sores or injuries may arise. If the original energy is harmed, the邪气 (evil energy) will increase, leading to ulcers that extend upwards and cause death. Even if they do not rupture and are discolored, they will still lead to death. If there are broken bones but the sinews and skin are still connected, they must be urgently cut away.</p>
<p>Zhao Zigong&#39;s mother, Mrs. Liu, was sixty years old, with a sore on the front of her left foot, leading down to the big toe and up to the outer ankle, affecting the heel bone. This condition recurred every year, lasting for several months, with severe itching in the evening to the point that she would scratch until it bled like a fountain, moaning in pain, almost unbearable. It would gradually ease at midnight, only to return the next day. Each application of medicine caused the sore to grow larger and more severe, and a hundred attempts at treatment were ineffective, carrying on like this for over twenty years. In the late winter of the year Jiachen during the Chunxi era, the master was a senior official. One evening, her illness flared up intensely, and in despair, they wept together with no way out. Overcome with fatigue, he fell asleep and dreamed of four divine monks silently sitting in a room, with a long couch beside them, where Zigong also sat and sighed. One monk asked him about the matter, and Zigong replied truthfully. The monk said: You can take &quot;Cow Gold and Tiger Pill.&quot;<a id="trans-441p" href="#orig-441p" class="marker">[441p]</a></p></div>

I tried to take half a grain of the medicine, but forced myself to consume it. After a long while, I experienced severe pain, and my family wept and regretted the action. Soon, I passed several pounds of stones that felt like iron or rock. That evening, the sores merely itched, caused no pain, and bled not at all; within a few days they formed scabs, and from then on, I completely recovered. The claims about cinnabar were not pursued further. The teacher then depicted the monk&#39;s likeness as in the dream and recorded the events. The Golden Tiger Pill, derived from the &quot;Harmony Medicine Bureau Formulas,&quot; is primarily for treating phlegm obstructing strokes and includes ingredients like cow bile, dragon brain, and fine powders, which are unsuitable for the elderly. Now, it has unexpectedly yielded remarkable effects, suggesting that heat accumulated in the organs manifests on the skin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhu Zuo Xiang, due to a slip, suddenly made a sound; after sitting or standing for a long time, his left foot became numb, and although it was summer, his feet felt as cold as ice. In the summer of the Jiajing year of the Ji-hai, he got drunk and fell asleep, then drank water and fell asleep again, subsequently feeling a hard lump in his right abdomen. When he touched it, there was a gurgling sound inside his belly; rubbing it warmed up the area but released gas and then stopped the noise. The discomfort often intensified, and even slightly overeating would cause pain and diarrhea. He sought treatment from doctors, who prescribed him a pill made from bitter orange and herbs, but it was ineffective. In the year of the Jiachen, he sought treatment from me. I said: This is not a condition of the spleen and stomach, but rather a decline of the life gate fire that is unable to generate earth, leading to a false cold reaction. If one focuses only on the spleen and stomach, that would be a misjudgment. He could take the Eight Flavor Pill, which would cure him. He respectfully took it, and indeed it worked. The Eight Flavor Pill contains aconite, which doctors typically dare not use lightly. Aconite is akin to cutting through barriers and restoring life; only a virtuous general can utilize it properly.</p>
<p>Yang Jin Yi had a boil on his heel, about the size of a bean, which was very painful and resembled a condition caused by a cold. I commented that hunters can get their heels bitten by rabbits, resulting in sores that turn into lifelong ailments. If a person&#39;s heel suffers from sores, they too will never fully heal, hence it is named “rabbit bite.” I then treated him with a restorative elixir and internal blocking powder, which provided slight relief. Subsequently, due to indulging in pleasures, he experienced pain and took strong poison-clearing medications, which weakened his blood and energy, leading to limpness in his legs and knees, eventually culminating in death. The heel is the source of the two primary tendons and the passageway of the kidney meridian; if the sore does not heal properly, the energy cannot rise, and the kidney energy thus leaks out, leading to a lifelong ailment. Moreover, the sore had originally developed from deficiency, and he did not heed warnings. Even a robust tonification of qi and blood would still be insufficient, let alone the harmful and aggressive toxic medicines that could further harm him.<a id="trans-444p" href="#orig-444p" class="marker">[444p]</a></p></div>

I believed this indicated a deficiency in the three yin of the legs, warning against the onset of sores. Not trusting, they took more cooling and phlegm-resolving medications, which only increased the evening heat and headaches; later, they took Si Wu decoction, Huangbai, and Zhimu. The evening heat intensified, their appetite diminished, and sores appeared on their small feet and face. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan over a hundred doses, and they recovered. Many do not believe that sores can arise from such issues and thus do not seek help.</p>

Medication to promote circulation and reduce fire caused pain in her heels and toes, with heat like burning.

It felt as if there was no skin, or like cracks appeared. From day to night, there was swelling, pain, and heat. This was due to deficiency of the three Yin of the foot. I prescribed modified Eight Flavor Pill and Xiao Yao San, adding cooked Rehmannia and Chuanxiong, and after over a hundred doses, she was cured.</p>
<p>Another woman experienced heat and pain in her heel due to exertion. I believed it was due to deficiency of the three Yin of the foot, and after treating her with Eight Treasure Decoction, she recovered. Later, she developed itching all over her body.

<p>Yang Taipu of Xindu, over forty years old, had redness and swelling with heat and pain in the big toe of his left foot.

He was then treated with a detoxifying powder combined with honeysuckle and bai zhi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had pain in her arm with muscle spasms, unable to extend or bend it; the pain worsened with cold, and her pulse was tight and thin. This was identified as a deficiency of liver qi, with wind and cold circulating through the blood vessels and obstructing the muscles. When the muscles are not nourished, they become stiff and painful. She was first treated with a muscle relaxing decoction, and then with a version of the four-substance decoction adding peony root, moonwort, and bai zhu, which healed her. There were also cases of arm pain where she could not lift it or experienced pain when turning, likely caused by phlegm stagnating at the center of the body, with spleen qi not flowing properly; for these, the formula fu ling wan or kong yan dan was suitable.</p>
<p>A county magistrate Hu experienced pain all over his body, and two months later, swelling developed on the top of his left foot; shortly thereafter, his thigh also had a swollen area. The pulse was light and diagnostic indicated a floating nature, while deeper examination showed a slow pulse. This indicated a deficiency of qi and blood, with the pores not being tight, allowing cold evil to invade the deficiency. He was treated with a modified small life-preserving decoction for four doses and several doses of a decoction of du huo and gui zhi, which alleviated his pain. He continued treatment with a tonic containing shen, qi, gui, and zhu for a hundred applications until he recovered.</p>
<p>Liu Sheng had a lump in his arm resembling a chestnut, extending to his neck and resembling scrofula.

She used remedies to dispel wind and invigorate blood, and over the course of a year, it gradually opened up to the size of a palm. She then took herbal medicines like Cao Wu, which led to itching all over her body, intermittent blood oozing, internal heat, and fatigue; her appetite diminished, and her menstrual cycle occurred every three months with a strong and rapid pulse. Upon examination, her pulse was weak, indicating that the drying agents further harmed her spleen and blood. I first prescribed a modified Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Shao Yao, Chuan Xiong, and other herbs for over ten doses, then administered a modified Xiao Yao San with Shu Di and Diao Teng for over twenty doses, and finally used Gui Pi Decoction with Chuan Xiong and Shu Di Huang, but it did not improve.</p>
<p>A man prone to anger had a greenish face and suffered from eczema-like symptoms on his inner thighs, with redness and itching. He sought treatment through bloodletting, which resulted in heat, swelling, and pain. Taking Xiao Feng San aggravated his condition, and consuming Yu Xian Dan intensified his thirst and fever. Despite this, he continued the treatment, resulting in profuse pus and water, with a rapid pulse, particularly on the left side. I opined that the liver meridian was deficient in blood, causing internal heat to harm the blood and exacerbate the sores. I initially used several doses of Chai Hu Qing Gan San and then treated him with Si Wu and Shan Zhi Zi, leading to gradual recovery. After two months of taking Ba Zhen Tang and Di Huang Wan, he was cured.</p>
<p>One person had a carbuncle on the inner side of the leg; it was swollen and painful but had not formed pus. After taking Huang Qi Chai Hu Tang for two doses, he improved slightly, and after two more doses, the swelling subsided.</p>
<p>Another individual had a leg carbuncle that was swollen and painful, with cold limbs, a sensation of throat obstruction, and chills and fever. He did not respond to various treatments, which indicated that the evil was obstructing the meridians.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ding Lan, over twenty years old, had a long-standing internal suffering due to a toxin in his thigh. He sought to expel it internally. Upon examining the pulse, which was slippery and rapid, I knew the pus had formed, but due to the deficiency of qi and blood, it had not burst. I therefore made an incision, allowing the pus to flow out with pain accompanying it. I applied Ba Zhen Tang, which had slight effect, but the pus was still light and thin. I then used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with five fen of charred Fu Zi; after taking several doses, he gradually improved. He continued on Shi Quan Da Bu Tang for over twenty more doses and was healed. Dan Xi said: &quot;If pus discharges yet pain persists, it indicates deficiency.&quot; He Jian also stated similarly.</p>
<p>There was a monk with a lump on the outer thigh, neither painful nor suppurating. I treated it with over twenty doses of expelling toxins medicine, which led to pus formation; I then incised it, resulting in pain. I stated that if it swelled and then ruptured, with pain following, this indicates severe qi and blood deficiency. It needs vigorous tonification. However, they said: &quot;Pain cannot be treated with tonics.&quot; I argued that when the upright qi is insufficient, it must be replenished; tonifying it will allow the qi to transform, thus alleviating pain. I then treated it with Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Dang Gui, Bai Zhu, and Shu Di Huang. After over two months, he recovered. Generally, sores and ulcers initially present as swelling. The accumulation of qi and blood causes the flesh to fester into pus, which often results in pain. After the pus discharges, the swelling subsides, the flesh relaxes, and the pain must gradually lessen. If the pain intensifies, this indicates insufficient qi and blood, affirming the perspectives of Dan Xi and He Jian on severe deficiency.</p>
<p>One person had a festering sore on the outer side of the thigh, which was greatly swollen and painful. I prescribed Nei Tuo Huang Qi Tang decocted with wine for two doses, which provided slight relief. I then applied Tuo Li San for several doses, leading to recovery.</p>

<p>A person had redness, swelling, and pain in the right leg; upon pulse examination, it was found to be deep and rapid. He was given a decoction based on Angelica to address the pain.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One man, over fifty years old, suffered from an abscess in his leg during winter. His pulse was rapid and agitated, he experienced constipation after drinking cold, and the swelling and pain were quite severe. This indicated heat lingering within, so it was advisable to use bitter and cold medicine, doubling the dose of Huangqin in a cool drink. The heat quickly receded, and he was cured with Siwu Decoction plus Huangqin.</p>
<p>Another man, aged thirty, had ongoing worries and was prone to overexertion and indulging in lust. The outside of his left leg was red and swollen like millet. A doctor prescribed Dafu Shiqi and Chengqi for purging, while another doctor prescribed Dahuang, Zhushā, and Xuejie, which led to a large and weak pulse, and he ultimately died. This was due to the pattern of more qi and less blood associated with Jueyin.</p>
<p>A man with a leg abscess developed pus, which was needled, resulting in about two bowls of pus being discharged. After taking a dose of Tori medicine, he ran a high fever. Further doses of Shengyu Decoction were given and the fever subsided. The next day, he felt severe chills and had no appetite, with a pulse as fine as a thread. One liang of ginseng and three slices of Shudufu were decocted and taken, leading to recovery. However, he still had poor appetite and insomnia, so he was treated with Neibu Huangqi Decoction until he stabilized.</p>
<p>A man with swollen legs and feverish chills was treated with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. He thought this treatment was slow and instead took drugs like Qin and Lian, which intensified the heat, prompting him to seek further treatment. I gave him over twenty doses of Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction, leading to a resolution of the problem. Subsequently, I prescribed ginseng, Huangqi, Angelica, Atractylodes, roasted licorice, and cinnamon for about a month until the issue was contained. </p>
<p>When dealing with fire-type illnesses, one should differentiate between deficiency and excess. Qin and Lian, being bitter and cold, can drain excessive fire from the heart and lungs. However, when dealing with the elderly or those weakened by diet and overwork, the condition is one of insufficiency, which requires sweet warming remedies for treatment. It is never seen that there is excess heat accompanied by a fear of cold or deficiency heat accompanied by a liking for cold; this is the principle observed.<a id="trans-451p" href="#orig-451p" class="marker">[451p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chen Jiansheng was in his thirties, with his left leg slightly swollen and experiencing hidden pain. Although the color of the flesh remained the same over time, he had little appetite. Dongyuan stated: &quot;In cases of sores and swellings, when there is hardness below the swelling, it arises from the tendons and bones.&quot; This was a bone-abscess, due to genuine qi deficiency and dampness invading the flesh. It is said that all swellings relate to the stomach; if food intake is low, the stomach becomes weak. The treatment should aim to strengthen the stomach&#39;s qi. Thus, a modified Liujunzi Decoction was prescribed with added Huo Xiang and Dang Gui over several doses, gradually increasing his diet, followed by a recovery with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction.</p>
<p>One individual experienced pain all over his body, and after two months, a lump formed on the top of his foot. Shortly after, another painful area appeared on his thigh. Light pulse diagnosis showed a floating nature, and a more thorough examination indicated it was floating and slow. This was due to insufficient qi and blood, with the pores being loose, allowing cold pathogens to invade the deficiency. Four doses of a modified Xiao Xu Ming Decoction and several doses of Du Huo Ji Sheng Decoction were administered, leading to a sudden relief of pain; further treatment with a tonic containing increased quantities of Ren Shen, Qi, Gui, and Shu yielded full recovery.</p>
<p>Wang Jingshan from the southern garrison had swelling and pain in his legs, with alternating chills and fever, yet maintained a normal appetite. His pulse was forceful and rapid, indicating damp-heat stagnation in the foot’s three yang channels. A single dose of Ping Su Bai Du San alleviated the chills and fever, and another dose relieved the swelling and pain; further use of Xiao Yao San restored his original qi. Two months later, due to anger, he experienced pain from swelling akin to being driven by needles, with a diffuse reddish hue. Two doses of Huoming Decoction alleviated the pain, and further treatment with Ba Zhen Tang, augmented with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Dan Pi, completely stopped the pain. Subsequently, due to labor, he became fatigued and apathetic about food, feeling heavy in the legs. This was attributed to the spleen and stomach qi deficiency, which failed to elevate; a prescription of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Man Jing Zi was used for stabilization.<a id="trans-452p" href="#orig-452p" class="marker">[452p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A Confucian scholar suffered from swelling and pain in his legs, with unchanged flesh color, chills and fever, poor appetite, and fatigue. This indicated insufficient spleen energy, with damp phlegm descending.

<p>A man entered a room and experienced swelling and hardness in both legs, with constipation. I suggested that the kidneys open to the two lower orifices, indicating damage to the liver and kidneys. I prescribed Liuwei Dihuang Wan, adding Cheqianzi and Niuxi for two convenient bowel movements, and used the Baizhu Yiqi Decoction to reduce the swelling and hardness, pleased that he was young and survived.</p>
<p>A scholar suffered severe pain in his leg, like being pierced, with unchanged flesh color, a sallow complexion, poor appetite, and intense pain leading to vomiting. This pain was harmful to the stomach. I treated him with Liu Junzi Decoction to strengthen his spleen and stomach, and used Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction to assist with the pus for acupuncture. Additionally, I increased Ren Shen, Huangqi, Xiong, Danggui, Maidong, Wuweizi, Yuanzhi, and Beimu in the previous decoction for wound healing.<a id="trans-453p" href="#orig-453p" class="marker">[453p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man, burdened and with poor diet, experienced chest pain, mistakenly attributing it to sores and toxins. He took large doses of Da Huang and other medicines, but his right leg swelled without discoloration. He also suffered from headaches, chills, cough, thirst, fever, and a pulse that was large but weak. This was due to a depletion of vital energy from overexertion, exacerbated by the medications harming his stomach energy. I prescribed four doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and several doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, pleased that his youth aided in his recovery.</p>
<p>Honglu Zhai Shaoxi developed sores that eventually led to fever throughout his body, with symptoms including phlegm production, dry mouth, dry throat, night sweats, irritability, red urine, and hot feet, worsening by evening and causing weight loss. This indicated a deficiency of kidney yin with excess fire. I used Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and within a month, all symptoms resolved. After three months, his vital energy was restored.</p>
<p>Another man had swelling in his left leg with normal flesh color, experiencing chills, fever, nausea, and reduced appetite. This indicated insufficient spleen energy affected by external pathogens. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Decoction with addition of Huoxiang, Jiegeng, and Chuanxiong, which alleviated the chills and fever, followed by Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to relieve the swelling and pain.</p>
<p>Chen Hu Lu Maocheng, due to excessive drinking and indulging in sexual activities, developed a fever and leg pain resembling sores. I gave him a formula to promote sweating, but both legs became swollen and dark, with a mist-like heat, on the verge of convulsions, and his pulse was notably strong and rapid, especially in the lower extremities. I suggested this was due to deficiency in the three yin channels of the legs, compounded by dampness from alcohol, leading to a loss of vital energy and exacerbation of pathogens. I prescribed Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction with added Shan Yao, Shan Zhu Yu, and Fu Zi, which promptly improved his pulse and symptoms. I then removed Fu Zi and after two more doses he was fully cured.<a id="trans-454p" href="#orig-454p" class="marker">[454p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Medical Cases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Case</strong>: The venerable Xue Xunzhai, aged sixty-one, suffered from wind sores on both legs, with pus oozing and a fever accompanied by phlegm for four years; this was due to kidney wind. He was treated with Liuwei Wan (Six-Flavor Pill) and Sisheng San (Four Fresh Powder) and recovered. After a year, the ailment recurred, spreading throughout his body, worsening in the afternoons, accompanied by phlegm thirst and night sweats, with sores on his lips and tongue and red, dim eyes—indicative of a deficiency of kidney yin and excess fire. He was treated with a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill and was cured. Three years later, he experienced dripping during urination, and painful sensations in the genitals—this indicated impotence with drained essence. The essence failed to emit, leading to internal decay. He was treated with the previous pill and with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Restore the Middle and Augment the Qi) plus wheat husk and five-flavored herb, leading to recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Governor Zhang Tianze&#39;s Case</strong>: He had swelling and pain in the left knee, fullness and discomfort in the chest, poor appetite and frequent nausea, with phlegm blocking his head, and increasing fatigue in the afternoons—this indicated a deficiency in the spleen and lungs. He was treated with a scallion poultice and Liu Jun Zi Tang (Six Gentlemen Decoction) augmented with fried ginger, which quickly alleviated the symptoms, although appetite remained low. He was given Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Chinese privet fruit, resulting in a clear and refreshed head. Subsequently, he was given over ten doses of Da Fang Feng Tang (Major Siler Decoction) and more than thirty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi, after which the swelling subsided.<a id="trans-455p" href="#orig-455p" class="marker">[455p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Liu Guowei from the Dongfu suffered from muscle and bone pain, with his right knee swollen. After using phlegm-resolving and detoxifying medicinals, the swelling and pain worsened, coupled with reduced appetite and fatigue. Adding medicines to dispel wind and detoxify led to chills, fever, and nausea, along with loose stools. After administering Erchen Decoction to dispel dampness, the swelling became red and internal pain felt like being pierced. Upon examining his pulse, it was slippery, rapid, and weak; this indicated the presence of pus, and the vital energy was deficient, unable to resolve. I prescribed four doses of Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, along with one dose of Da Fang Feng Decoction, leading to resolution, and after over a hundred doses, he was cured.</p>
<p>One Confucian scholar experienced leg muscle tension with swollen and painful knees for more than a month, which was caused by deficiency of yin and damp-heat. I used Liu Wei Di Huang Wan as the main treatment, supplemented with Ba Zhen Decoction, adding Niu Xi and Du Zhong, alternating with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and after more than three months, it resolved.</p>
<p>One man had leg pain and knee swelling; the pulse was floating, and palpating revealed a tightness, indicating liver and kidney deficiency, caused by &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; I prescribed two doses of Da Fang Feng Decoction, which resolved the condition. He was confused about the toxicity of Fuzi and thus took medicine meant for ulcers, gradually wasting away and presenting with deficiency symptoms, leading him to seek treatment again. I remarked: fatigue and weight loss indicated that the spleen and stomach were weak and unable to nourish; inability to control urination indicated a deficiency of the bladder; dry heat and empty distension suggested weak stomach qi could not digest; confusion and forgetfulness meant spiritual loss and incoherence. Severe symptoms gathered, and I declined further treatment, after which he ultimately passed away. This condition often afflicts those with deficiency, thus I recommended modified Xiaoxu Ming and Da Fang Feng Decoctions. Using detoxifying medicines would surely be detrimental.<a id="trans-456p" href="#orig-456p" class="marker">[456p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman experienced swollen and painful knees, which worsened with cold. For over a month, various medicines had no effect, and her pulse was taut and tight, indicating that cold evil was deeply lodged within. I prescribed a large dosage of Fangfeng Decoction combined with Huolong Ointment to alleviate her condition.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen left knee that had not ruptured for three months. I believed that in those with weak constitutions, wind evil attacks the joints, causing qi stagnation, resulting in an enlarged knee and a thinner leg, a condition known as &quot;Crane Knee Wind.&quot; I then administered more than thirty doses of Fangfeng Decoction, and the swelling subsided.</p>
<p>Zhang Shangshe suffered from Crane Knee Wind, with pus flowing for three months after lying on a pillow for half a year. He said that he initially took Fangfeng Decoction without Aconite; as the swelling was about to rupture, he took the Ten Xuan Powder. Now he used the Complete Tonifying Decoction without cinnamon and also received no response. Upon examining his pulse, which was very weak, I prescribed the Complete Tonifying Decoction, increasing the Aconite to ten grams. After more than thirty doses, there was slight improvement; I then reduced the Aconite to five grams and continued for over thirty doses, leading to further recovery; eventually, I removed the Aconite altogether and after another thirty doses, he was cured. </p>
<p>The principle of a formula must suit individual cases. In those with weak qi, if evil enters the bones and joints, obstructing the pathways, one cannot rely on the pungent and warm properties of Aconite and cinnamon to dispel the cold evil from the joints and facilitate the flow of qi and blood through the pathways; it will not lead to healing. Moreover, the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; states that Aconite is a holy medicine for treating cold and dampness. Cinnamon opens the blood vessels, eliminates stagnant blood, strengthens the joints, treats wind and dampness, and promotes the efficacy of various medicines.<a id="trans-457p" href="#orig-457p" class="marker">[457p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Ten Complete and Great Tonic Soup is used to treat the aforementioned conditions, and not only should cinnamon not be removed, but aconite should also be added. Without these two ingredients, how can the effects of ginseng and astragalus be realized, or the qualities of angelica and chuanxiong support blood and energy, helping to unblock the meridians and reinforce the severe deficiency to achieve effective results? Furthermore, since the aforementioned condition occurs between the bones and joints, a critical area, treating it hastily without promoting blood and energy circulation can lead to stagnation and form pus, causing a leak that exhausts the vital essence, disrupting the natural process of regeneration. Additionally, one may experience conditions caused by exposure to the cold in autumn and summer that lead to internal heat, thus developing abscesses in the bones. If wind attacks the joints, causing deep pain in the bones, especially aggravated by the cold, applying heat may provide slight relief, but it is essential to use a large dose of wind-dispelling soup, and also to crush and spread garlic on the affected area, covering it with mugwort and burning it. Even if the garlic deteriorates, the breaking of the skin is not a concern. If the condition does not improve after a long time and if yin is generated causing yang to rupture and leak fluids, it can result in localized atrophy or leakage conditions; in such cases, one should take internal sealing powder and apply aconite moxibustion. If the pulse is strong and thirst is present, it should not be treated, for it indicates a deficiency of genuine vital energy and an excess of pathogenic energy.<a id="trans-458p" href="#orig-458p" class="marker">[458p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At Juyong Pass, Wang Huishige experienced swelling in one arm, which was not painful or red, yet the pulse was weak and he had little appetite, occasionally vomiting. He was treated with Liu Junzi Decoction, supplemented with Agastache and wine-fried Peony root, which stopped the vomiting and allowed him to eat. He then took Ba Zhen Decoction for over twenty doses, resulting in the formation of pus that was drained; he was later cured with Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. </p>
<p>The following year, after suffering a chill from a fever, his arm remained slightly swollen and painful, attributed to residual toxins from the fever. However, there were no surface symptoms, just general weakness. Initially, I used Shi Xuan San for four doses to support the vital energy with Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica, and Chuanxiong, while Fangfeng, Platycodon, Bai zhi, and Houpu were used to disperse the swelling; cinnamon was used to invigorate the channels and break up the blood stasis, leading to a reduction in swelling after three to four treatments. He subsequently took Ba Zhen Decoction, and the pus was resolved, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>By winter, his arm began to hurt again after taking wind-dispelling medicine, resulting in severe muscle cramps. I believed that this was due to a deficiency of blood that could not nourish the muscles, and the weakness in the muscles could not support the bones. Therefore, I prescribed an enhanced Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction for a hundred doses, leading to his recovery.<a id="trans-459p" href="#orig-459p" class="marker">[459p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wang Wenyuan suffered from swelling and pain in his arm. After taking cold and cooling medicine, he experienced a loss of appetite and ineffective bowel movements. I prescribed two doses of the Lizhong pill, and further treated him with Six-Gentlemen Decoction, adding sandalwood and patchouli, which led to an improvement and eventual recovery after the pus discharged. Generally, for severe pain due to abscesses, if the person has a robust constitution with excess internal heat, then bitter and cold medications are advisable; if the constitution is weaker, then one should use the Middle-Boosting and Energy-Increasing Decoction, adding herbs like Scutellaria and Coptis. For those who are overweight and experiencing painful abscesses, it is best to use herbs like Vitex, Saposhnikovia, and Notopterygium, as they are known to dispel wind and overcome dampness.</p>
<p>A woman in her twenties, after meals, would often experience sour regurgitation and bloating, accompanied by swollen heels when she was angry. She did not respond to medications like the Yueju pill. This was due to a deficiency in the spleen and downward movement of dampness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chen, the envoy, was over fifty years old. In winter, he suffered from an abscess in his leg, with a rapid pulse, restlessness, coldness, and constipation; the swelling and pain were severe. This was due to internal heat. The treatment involved cool herbs and an increased dose of Huangqin to bring down the condition; subsequently, he was cured with Siwu Decoction plus Huangqin.</p>
<p>Zhang Fu, a man from Beijing, was over thirty years old. He was generally timid and weak, unable to eat cold food. He had a toxic condition in his arm with a weak pulse. I treated him with purgative medicine, leading to an outbreak. However, he had reduced appetite or experienced bloating and sourness, gradually becoming emaciated. Ginseng and Poria didn&#39;t help, but the pulse on the right wrist was weak; this indicated a decline in the fire of the Mingmen, which couldn’t generate earth. Therefore, I used Bawei Pill to tonify the earth, and gradually his appetite improved and he recovered. He also experienced pain in both knees, leading to pain in all joints—women suffering from blood wind and men from soft wind. This is known as wind-damp bi, also called joint pain. It should be treated with Fuzi Bawuzhong Decoction with modifications.</p>
<p>A woman had an abscess in her arm, with a purple and depressed wound and clear pus that wouldn’t close. She thought the poison hadn’t been completely expelled and wanted to take medication to expel the poison. I explained that for the condition of sores, if the swelling was hard and the pus thick, it was real; if the swelling was soft and the pus thin, it was deficient. I used a Fuzi cake for moxibustion along with administering a hundred doses of the Shiquan Dabu Decoction, after which she began to recover.<a id="trans-461p" href="#orig-461p" class="marker">[461p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Cao Jiangdu, the chief official, suffered from an abscess on the left foot next to the little toe. The pain was unbearable, and he urgently underwent over thirty treatments of garlic moxibustion, which allowed him to walk. Eager for a speedy recovery, he applied a cooling medicine, which led to blood coagulation and necrosis in the flesh, causing the toxic effects to intensify. After another hundred moxibustion treatments and taking a revitalizing potion, he expelled purple blood, indicating that the poison was beginning to resolve. However, the sole of his foot became severely ulcerated, with much rotten sinew and flesh. Just as he was about to recover, I had to return north for work, and he inadvertently used flesh-repairing medicine, which only aggravated the poison and depleted his vital energy, making the wound difficult to heal. Upon my return, I used a treatment to restore him, pleased with his robust constitution, and after staying in the guest house for over three months, he finally healed.</p>
<p>My cousin Zhifu had an abscess on the little finger of his right hand. Initially, he attempted to drain it with a needle, applying a cooling medicine, which caused his palm and finger to swell three to four times their normal size, and his pulse was greatly forceful. This indicated that true energy was being depleted, while evil energy prevailed. I first administered a life-saving pill and two doses of a revitalizing potion, which slightly alleviated his condition. While I was away, he further punctured to drain blood, causing the swelling to extend to his forearm and wrist like a large gourd, with his fingers swelling multiple times, unable to rupture—this indicated a further depletion of true energy and an increase in evil energy. Upon my return, I used a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and poria, along with frequent moxibustion across his hand, gradually reducing the swelling. Later, he experienced insufficient bowel movements and often felt weak, indicating his vital energy was sinking. I supplemented him with a tonic soup, adding herbs like psoralea, nutmeg, evodia, and schisandra, and replaced tea with a revitalizing powder. His bowel movements gradually improved, and the back of his hand began to resolve; he subsequently took over fifty doses of strong tonics until he recovered.<a id="trans-462p" href="#orig-462p" class="marker">[462p]</a></p></div>

I said: Generally, sores should not be painless; they should not be overly painful. If there is agitation, it should not be treated. Now, presented with numbness and especially itching, this is particularly bad. I administered two doses of a life-threatening pill, which showed no effect. I then used a detoxifying agent, and the itching began to subside, but then it developed into swelling and pain. I remarked: Although the situation seems dire, the presence of pain is a good sign. However, the toxic qi must be released; I want to use acupuncture. Just then, it was the time of the full moon, and his family only mentioned the spirit in his buttocks, refusing to comply, resulting in further swelling. I insisted on acupuncture, and all symptoms immediately receded; then I used the detoxifying agent, and the sore healed completely.</p>
<p>A man had a carbuncle on the outer side of his leg, which was swelling and causing severe pain. I prescribed a decoction of astragalus wine twice, which alleviated it somewhat.

The sore&#39;s edge was purple and sunken, with clear and thin pus, which I diagnosed as weakness. She did not believe me and took a toxic remedy, which worsened her condition, leading to further requests for treatment. I recommended moxibustion with aconite poultice and over a hundred doses of a nourishing tonic, after which she recovered. In cases where pus is thin and does not heal or is sunken, it indicates severe deficiency of qi and blood, which requires substantial tonification; otherwise, it leads to complications or failure.

Therefore, they used acupuncture to remove the stagnant blood at the affected site and continued with the previous medicine for two more doses, resulting in improvement. They then used Dang Gui Nian Tong Tang for four doses, which led to recovery. Yang Dashou said: &quot;Leg Qi is caused by blockage.

He did not fear wind or cold, only felt heat and restlessness; the pulse was not floating, suggesting the problem was not superficial. Both exterior and interior balanced, the evil was in the tendons and meridians. Hence, it was said that stagnation in the blood vessels causes boils. The boils appeared above halfway on the body, thus the wind influenced him from above, leading to changes due to the Eight Winds. The sores were confined to the meridians, so it was necessary to dispel cold and harmonize the blood and Qi in the meridians to remove any stagnation for healing. The appropriate remedy was Bai Zhi Sheng Ma Decoction. In this formula, the focus is on the entire body, thus Yangming pertains to the body as a whole. If discussing each channel, Yangming also has formulas for exterior and interior conditions. Sun Yang has its own treatments for both aspects, and the other channels can be similarly inferred.</p>
<p>One person had swollen and painful arms; after taking a tonic, the condition worsened daily. I concluded that the swelling was due to dampness and the pain to heat. This indicated humid heat infiltrating the meridians. I used Ren Shen Bai Du San, adding Wei Ling Xian, Jiu Huang Qin, and Nan Xing over several doses to gradually improve; I then supplemented Si Wu Tang with Cang Zhu, Huang Bo, and Jie Geng in over twenty doses to alleviate the condition. The initial tonic worsened the symptoms, thus a damp-heat treatment was implemented.<a id="trans-470p" href="#orig-470p" class="marker">[470p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man initially suffered from sores on his limbs, which later spread all over his body, resembling but not quite resembling scabies. At times, pus would ooze profusely, particularly from his legs. He experienced severe fatigue, itching, and a feeling of heat; he did not recover for over a year. I diagnosed him with deficient kidney fire and treated him with a modified version of the Eight Flavor Pill, which led to his recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Effective Remedies&quot; states: Dong Shouyue recommended treating athlete&#39;s foot by taking several rice snails, crushing them, and applying the mixture to the inner thighs; one would then feel a cool sensation descending to the feet, relieving the condition. The property of snails is to separate and clarify the dampness, thus healing the wet heat of athlete&#39;s foot.</p>
<p>In Piling, there was a man named Ma who sold wine and had long been troubled by wind in his kidneys. One of his feet had swollen like a gourd, and from his waist down, he was uniformly swollen. The pain was unbearable; he could only lie down and had to be assisted by two people to move. Someone suggested using a needle or knife to relieve it. I prescribed Gan Bie Powder for him. By the early hours of the morning, after chewing it with rice and drinking water, he produced several liters of pus that resembled crystal, and immediately the pain ceased and the swelling reduced. A month later, he still needed crutches to walk. I then applied Chi Wu Powder to his knee, which ultimately cured him. Ten years later, when I passed through Piling, he brought his son to express his gratitude, saying that the foot ailment had not recurred and the wind in his kidneys had disappeared; he could now walk briskly without suffering.<a id="trans-471p" href="#orig-471p" class="marker">[471p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the Jiezhu Temple in Shaoxing, a monk, who had been ill for several years and could not walk due to his condition, recovered after taking a medicinal pill. This method was also passed down by the elder Heng.</p>
<p>A person with a body full of excess fat began to suffer from leg edema. His head, face, and limbs exhibited slight swelling, all of which were red. His legs and feet were red and swollen, causing unbearable pain that made him afraid to use support. The pain intensified when his hands touched his skin, leading him to sit and then lie down repeatedly, suffering day and night, unable to describe his distress. Being in the cold North, he often drank alcohol, which over time damaged his spleen and hindered his digestion, contributing to the issue with his legs.</p>
<p>I administered a decoction of Angelica (Danggui) and pain-relief herbal soup weighing about 40 grams, which reduced his pain by half. After taking it again, all swelling and pain disappeared, leaving only slight redness and swelling in his right hand&#39;s fingers. Using a three-edged needle to prick the tips of his fingers released a lot of dark blood, and the redness and swelling completely subsided. </p>
<p>A few days later, after eating moist foods, he felt pain in his limbs again. I then prescribed half a dose of prickly ash, three doses of rhubarb cooked in liquor, one and a half doses of notopterygium, and one dose of Angelica, boiled in water and taken warm. This relieved his symptoms and his pain stopped.<a id="trans-472p" href="#orig-472p" class="marker">[472p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the year of Dingyou, in Lin&#39;an, during a time of extreme heat, I saw Wu Kuanfu using fire to heat a cloth bag to warm his feet. I inquired about it, and he replied: &quot;I have long suffered from foot ailments. Recently, I obtained a remedy using two or three pounds of Sichuan pepper, which I placed in a cloth bag and heated with fire. I then pressed my feet on the pepper bag.&quot; He explained that the properties of the pepper are hot and can dispel cold and dampness. This made a lot of sense; after using it for over a month, I gradually saw improvement. </p>
<p>In the year of Gengzi, in Chun&#39;an, Kuanfu passed by again. I asked about his ailment, and he said: &quot;I&#39;ve been cured for quite some time, thanks to the power of the pepper bag. Not only was it effective for me, but I passed it on to several relatives, and they are all well now. It truly is a miraculous formula.&quot; </p>
<p>In the year of Renyin, I returned to Lin&#39;an, and while staying at an inn, I unexpectedly met Captain Wang Cheng, who was also using fire to heat a cloth bag. I asked him, &quot;Is it not pepper?&quot; He replied: &quot;I also added a third of broken areca nut and a third of dried mugwort.&quot; He added, &quot;Indeed, it is remarkable.&quot; </p>
<p>Generally speaking, ailments of the feet and knees reside in the lower yin region, which is particularly prone to cold and dampness. The cold causes blood and qi to stagnate and congeal, and only heat can eliminate it. Now, by using the hot properties of Sichuan pepper and combining it with steam, the cold and dampness are naturally dispelled. Truly, the wisdom of the remedy is evident.<a id="trans-473p" href="#orig-473p" class="marker">[473p]</a></p></div>

Due to the severe cold, he was unresponsive, and his family mourned him. However, Zhongying Zheng Xunmei transmitted a cypress wood soup, which he consumed for half a meal; afterwards, he had three significant bowel movements, and the blockages dissipated. He was nearly dead but ended up surviving. Fearing for others who might similarly suffer from ailments like his, he decided to pass on this remedy.</p>
<p>Regarding Gu Anzhong from Guangde, he had long suffered from beriberi, experiencing tight tendons and swollen legs, making it challenging to walk. One day, he arrived at Huzhou and boarded a boat where a bag of items had been there already. The pain in his leg intensified, and upon resting it on the bag, he felt a slight relief from the pain, and his tendons relaxed. He then asked the boatman what was in the bag, and was told it contained Xuan melon. From that moment on, his beriberi suddenly improved. Ah!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Authentic Text on Surgery&quot; states: A man nearing fifty had a small finger on his right foot that initially grew like a grain of millet, gradually turning into a white blister, and began to hurt after three days. Upon consultation, the head was already rotten, and one finger was swollen and purple, indicating a form of gangrene. He was treated with thirteen applications of moxa fire, causing intense pain before it stopped. Needles were then used for acupuncture at the top, and a toad fat cake was applied and covered with a medicated plaster. On the swollen finger, a thin needle was used to pierce seven or eight spots to release toxic blood, and a concentrated ointment made from toad fat was applied. An external medicated powder was spread to protect healthy flesh from further invasion. At that time, the patient had a rapid pulse, experienced chills and fever, felt nauseous, and was fatigued. First, a ginseng decoction was used to alleviate the surface symptoms, followed by a Huanglian Decoction to facilitate bowel movements, which also relieved the nausea and heat. A detoxifying powder with honeysuckle and ox knee was taken several times, along with Bawei Pill in the morning and a wax alum pill in the evening, combining these treatments together to disperse the toxic energy with the help of heat. Needles were additionally used for detoxification, preventing the condition from deteriorating, thus turning the toxins into pus and allowing the swelling to subside. Later, a Shiquan Dabu Decoction was administered with additions like mountain fruit, five flavors, and Ophiopogon to regulate the body for a month until recovery. If this infection had not been treated with acupuncture and moxibustion to release the toxins, and if solely relied on medicinal applications without harsh remedies to attack and purge, it would have surely harmed the fundamental energy. How then could one expect to protect against the encroachment of toxins and achieve a state of peace?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A merchant had a purple blister appear on the second toe of his right foot, with extraordinary itch and pain. The next day, his toenail was completely purple and the flesh black. Upon examination, it was found to be the poison of the liver and kidney meridians. He asked: &quot;What is the distinction?&quot; I replied: &quot;The nail is the residual energy of the liver; when it is purple, it signifies that the liver has been poisoned. The bone is the residual energy of the kidney; when the kidney is damaged, the bone turns black. This reasoning is very clear.&quot; He inquired: &quot;What caused this?&quot; I explained: &quot;Generally, when a person exhausts their strength and injures their tendons, it affects the liver; when they recklessly take heating medicines, it harms the kidneys.&quot; A bystander interjected: &quot;This is indeed true.&quot; It turns out that he had long resided as a guest, associating closely with courtesans, with very deep affections involved, and he exerted himself greatly to please them.

Then place moxa sticks on the purple-tinted area where they are bound, spacing them evenly in three places, and apply seven cauterizations to each, along with toad venom cakes on top. Afterward, endure the swelling and pain without unbinding the hair. By the next night, the fingertip had turned black, indicating that the flesh, skin, and bone were all dead.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A maid, twelve years old, quite beautiful, was disliked by her new mistress for her large feet. The mistress tightly wrapped her feet with cloth and sewed them with thread, causing unbearable swelling and pain. When the maid complained, the mistress ignored her. After half a month, foul liquid began to flow from her feet. Upon inspection, the front halves of both feet were completely black and rotting, with flesh and bone dead. I said: &quot;What is already rotten cannot be revived, but we can save what hasn&#39;t decayed.&quot; First, boil ginseng porridge for her to eat. Then, prepare scallion broth for the maid to soak and wash her affected feet. Change the broth and soak again. For the areas that were rotting but not painful, trim them one by one; for those that were still sensitive to pain, apply a remedy with flower bud stone powder to ensure the rotting parts would heal and the already damaged ones would detach. Internally, administer a restorative tonic to replenish energy, and externally apply a healing ointment to encourage flesh growth. Though she eventually recovered, both feet remained permanently deformed.</p>
<p>A man had what looked like a yellow millet boil between the toes of his right foot. The skin turned purple, causing constant sharp pain, akin to being stabbed with a knife. Upon examining it, it was clearly a case of purulent necrosis. Diagnosing his pulse, it was thin, rapid, and weak, showing kidney deficiency. However, the patient had long been a heavy drinker, with excessive internal heat and a deficient constitution, indicating little chance for successful treatment, which I reluctantly admitted. Eventually, it spread to the top and sole of his foot, causing unbearable pain. His appetite diminished over time, his vitality waned, and two months later, he died in great suffering.<a id="trans-481p" href="#orig-481p" class="marker">[481p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Door Regulations&quot; states: Xu Yue was robust and vigorous, but in previous years, he sustained a slight injury to his index finger, which caused bleeding. He rinsed it with cold water, resulting in blood coagulation that did not disperse, leading to swelling and the discharge of several pints of pus and blood. The small tendons detached in three sections, rendering his finger unusable. Recently, during the autumn moon, he started feeling cold between his two feet; he covered them with heavy blankets, and while the outside felt warm, internally he sensed a chill. </p>
<p>Recently, he experienced pain in the tendons from his heels to his knees, making distant travel inconvenient. An old doctor from the clouds advised him to take the Eight-Flavored Pill, which resonated with his situation. Upon my diagnosis, I found that his pulse was difficult to discern, yet his liver and lung pulses were distinctly large. His illness was significantly advanced, especially in winter, when the wood (spring) falls and the metal (autumn) grows cold; this was particularly unsuitable. The current state of his condition suggests that there will be an inability to approach recovery; the components of the Eight-Flavored Pill, such as cinnamon and aconite, should not be taken lightly. </p>
<p>Why? The tendons are related to the liver. Since the blood nourishing the tendons has already been depleted by the earlier injury to his index finger, there is insufficient nourishment for the tendons and meridians. Furthermore, with frequent anger and movement, the liver fire transmits heat to the tendons, causing the major tendon in the feet to become stiff and short, hence the difficulty in walking. However, the liver primarily governs the lungs; wood is afraid of metal, and thus must rely on and receive support, much like a sovereign. This is why the lung energy must first be cleared, allowing the energy of the whole body to descend. </p>
<p>Now, with the lung pulse being large, the lung energy is then harmed by the heart, leading to blockage and lack of clarity, which subsequently prevents the yang energy from descending, hence the cold in the feet. Therefore, although the ailment seems minor, it has already violated three major principles.<a id="trans-482p" href="#orig-482p" class="marker">[482p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Ordinarily, the pulse is fine, but now it is strong; this is the first reversal. The liver pulse is large and heat descends, which is the second reversal. The lung pulse is large and the qi is obstructed upwards, which is the third reversal. If one mistakenly treats this with cassia and aconite, the heat will become hotter, and the obstruction will worsen, leading to atrophy and paralysis. In this situation, the use of medicine involves profound understanding that is usually beyond measure. The tendons are short and tense, and liver qi is internally trapped. One must urgently adhere to the principles of metal cutting wood for harmony; by cutting wood with metal, the wood flourishes in return, and the tendons relax. If one does not thoroughly comprehend the original principles, who can know this? However, if the energy of metal does not become obstructed, wood would not dare to suppress its command. Only when the metal loses its rigidity and turns supple can wood lose its suppleness and become rigid. Therefore, to treat this ailment, one must prioritize clearing the metal as the primary approach.<a id="trans-483p" href="#orig-483p" class="marker">[483p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the winter of Gengchen, I glimpsed the teacher&#39;s face at the ancestral garden of Ding Wengong. I secretly observed his body, which was heavy and found it difficult to walk, his complexion was dull, his speech slow, leading me to believe he was suffering from a condition due to excessive worry. In the autumn of Xinsi, during a consultation, I carefully examined him. His spleen pulse was irregular, while the lung pulse was strong; however, the liver energy was still balanced, and the yang energy was still vigorous, which indicated that the evil of the eight winds had not yet taken root. Yet, with the tendons and pulses being strained and painful, causing sleeplessness, it was largely due to wind aggravated by dampness, fueled by his vulnerability. This led me to conclude that he could still receive treatment for some time to come. Why is this? Wind is related to liver ailments, being the energy of heaven; dampness pertains to spleen issues, being the energy of earth. The quickness of heavenly energy causes sudden outbreaks, while the slowness of earthly energy can restrain such outbreaks. Yet, if the energies are different, the ailments will differ, and if the energies converge, the ailments will correlate; this must be clearly discerned. When ailments differ, in relation to heavenly energy, wind is the leader of all diseases. Its onset is subtle and follows a process of mutual restraint, inevitably beginning with the five organs before becoming intense; if it comes on strongly, it strikes directly without following the usual path. Only those with a weakened constitution will find the onset unpredictable. In relation to earthly energy, dampness is an issue of the lower body; if it develops subtly, the ankles become swollen, but once the cause is overcome, it dissipates quickly; if it comes on severely, it affects the skin and muscles, gradually advancing upwards, yet this too concerns those with yang deficiency, starting to rise abnormally. The two are rooted in distinct aspects of heaven and earth, with differing ailments and therefore requiring different treatments. When ailments converge, the energy of heaven enters the tendons, and the energy of earth also enters the tendons.<a id="trans-485p" href="#orig-485p" class="marker">[485p]</a></p></div>

As for humidity, it is both brewed internally with rich wine and flavors and externally attacked by hot mist and pestilence; thus, the feet suffer daily, and despite the relaxation of the entire body’s tendons and meridians, there is still discomfort. Ultimately, nothing compares to the ceaseless tugging pain in the feet, with sores and swellings that become unmanageable.

What is commendable is only the cold water in winter, which somewhat reduces the situation.

How can one counteract wind-damp and heat-damp with such counterproductive methods without worsening the condition? Moreover, if a person&#39;s lung pulse is vigorous and they have a bowel movement only once every three or four days, and even in winter they enjoy cold drinks and rarely approach fire, how can one deem them affected by cold dampness? Thus, in Sun Zhenren’s prescriptions like the major and minor bamboo juice formulas, remedies for wind, dampness, heat, dryness, and cold are all present, yet they are mixed and complex, leaving later generations entirely unaware of their applications. If one understands this principle of taking and removing, it becomes a profound and enlightened matter.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Qian Shuweng has a slender physique and typically produces more heat than phlegm. In recent years, internal heat has transformed into phlegm due to dampness. During the summer and autumn of the year of Xin Si, with the heaviness of damp heat, he suddenly experienced numbness in his right foot, which felt as cold as ice or stone. This extreme heat manifested as cold, akin to the phenomenon of icy hail in summer. The physicians, noticing the coldness of his ankle, failed to observe that the cold was due to extreme heat resembling coldness. They erroneously treated him with warming herbs such as cattle knee, papaya, ephedra, the bark of trees, and other warming agents. They even believed that his lower essence was deficient and used substances like cinnamon and aconite for replenishment. Using fire to combat fire and adding heat to heat led to an abscess that festered for several months, rendering the ankle, foot, and toes useless. His treatment continued to worsen, and the situation reached such extremes. The reasoning behind this is quite clear and not difficult to discern. If indeed cold phlegm were to descend, it would merely congeal without dispersing, or at worst, lead to weakness and numbness. How could it possibly result in swelling, ulceration, yellow fluid oozing, and decaying flesh and tendons? Those involved do not recognize the misguided treatment from the physicians and instead attribute the outcomes to a divine retribution from the gods. Could it be so? This closely resembles the symptoms of febrile diseases where pathogenic heat penetrates the meridians, resulting in fluid accumulation—there is little difference. The ginseng paste used can only briefly support the original qi, without any medications to clear and resolve the damp heat as an adjunct, which is why its efficacy remains unremarkable.<a id="trans-488p" href="#orig-488p" class="marker">[488p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>On the day of an eclipse, coupled with nighttime eating, even though one&#39;s spleen qi is strong, it is not harmed by food. However, the spleen qi generated by ginseng is not utilized to move phlegm and heat, but is merely used to digest food, which is truly regrettable. Nowadays, food intake also does not easily facilitate movement, which should promote growth but instead leads to decline. Consequently, phlegm and fluid accumulate in the chest, causing fullness and discomfort, leading to coughs with phlegm that does not resolve, all due to the spleen losing its strength and the stomach failing to transport fluids. Instead of aiding digestion, the food leads to phlegm, gradually filling the lung passages, making it difficult to expel the cough. Although treating phlegm is urgent, the medicines used for it often deplete qi and induce weakness, raising concerns that phlegm may not be expelled before wind invades. Only by using sweet, cold medicines to expel wind, eliminate heat, moisten dryness, replenish deficiency, and clear phlegm can one find lawful treatment. As for pungent and hot medicines, they should never be used again. Medical practitioners clearly see this, yet still use cassia and aconite inappropriately, likely believing in their strong drying effect and striving for a quick resolution.

Digging a well is certainly difficult, and opening a canal is not easy either. Alas! What to do! I will open another avenue for you. Wine is a clear and pure substance; it does not descend with impurities but prefers to seep in. The area of seepage begins from the stomach into the gallbladder, which is the abode of purity, seeking similar energies. However, the gallbladder&#39;s capacity to absorb is limited; next, it flows from the stomach into the intestines, with the bladder seeping it out, converting it into a unique form of excretion. When it reaches this stage of transformation, what remains is the essence of the wine, and its potency is primarily borne by the gallbladder. I have often seen those who drink well, always pouring lightly and sipping slowly, allowing for absorption in the stomach. If one drinks continuously in quick succession, they merely empty their purse. Thus, when wine has reached a moderate level of intoxication, even the timid possess the courage to shout and confront, the poor may have the bravery to gamble everything, the reclusive may dare to break through barriers, and even the fierce may have the audacity to wield a sword and kill, not to mention the hedonistic who may drink in excessive quantities without regard for their life.<a id="trans-492p" href="#orig-492p" class="marker">[492p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The small man from Lu, despite his extreme poverty, does not lose heart; is it not due to his dependence on wine? His illness is indeed different from others. The gallbladder does not have a natural outlet. When the gallbladder is hot, others may transfer this heat to the brain, causing mucous to flow freely from the nose, which can reduce this heat somewhat. However, for the small man from Lu, the yang in his body is excessively strong, while the yin is severely deficient, with no hair left, resembling a barren place in the south. The heat is extreme; can he tolerate the heat transferred from the gallbladder? Fortunately, he sweats a lot from his head, and the heat from his brain is released, preventing it from becoming a major issue. Yet, if the heat from the gallbladder cannot be dispersed and is compounded by the heat of wine, along with the dryness of the season, this internal heat will burn intensely, and his pulse is notably rapid; how could he not become exhausted? Therefore, when the heat from the gallbladder overflows and seeps into the meridians, his body and eyes turn yellow, resulting in the illness caused by wine toxicity due to this seepage. It can be diverted and eliminated through the bladder via urination. Now, merely attacking the Huaijiao point cannot drive this out since it is fundamentally linked to the gallbladder, from which there is nothing more to expel.<a id="trans-493p" href="#orig-493p" class="marker">[493p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, the person&#39;s gait has long been affected by this ailment; they have been injured for a long time, with energy depleted and blood scattered, the lingering heat pathogen pervasive. Even if many medications are taken, they are rejected and not assimilated; how can one expect any effect? If one wishes to use acupuncture, this long-injured point presents difficulties in supplementation. The original text used &quot;expel&quot; but was altered for context. The aim is to drain. If a skilled practitioner were encountered, like those in ancient times, what method would they use to treat this? I have further concerns: after the body is established, one relies on the nourishment of grain energy, which is the source energy. If a person has little grain intake and resorts to wine for their source energy, now due to illness they abstain from drinking, what will they rely on for their long-term vitality? I carefully contemplate a method: first, to induce the yellowish fluid from the brain to exit through the nose, then to needle several points along the gallbladder meridian in the brain area, aiming to expel the heat from the gallbladder through the nasal passages. This way, the lingering pathogens in the junction of the legs are gradually mobilized, and the dryness of the intestines and stomach can slowly recover. Afterwards, a medicine to purge the gallbladder heat should be added to wine, allowing for daily indulgence in drunkenness. The method of consumption remains the same, but the nature of the wine varies, so that the yin may flow, and its use becomes exquisite. It is necessary to make use of one’s habitual nature as a stronghold, which must employ wine to serve as guidance for assistance. Can methods focused on cleansing and moistening truly resolve the situation? Two individuals cheeringly stated: &quot;Being taught the treatment methods brings clarity to the heart; please record this to express the joy of sharing knowledge.&quot; I document this for you, to be sent to the young scholar, who is seeking help.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Huang Hongxuan suddenly developed a carbuncle on his arm, which became swollen, and he suffered extreme headaches. The surgeons all said it was caused by heat and poison. Considering his usual disposition, which is calm and purposeful, and that he has a tranquil mind without any source for generating heat and poison, he could not identify the origin of the ailment. I, the respected elder, also consulted Changshan about the illness; why not set aside the wine and food and consult a skilled cook instead? Chang replied, “Before discussing this condition, let us first offer our congratulations, and then we may speak of it.” </p>
<p>Every sore and ulcer has its cause: external causes include toxic effects of abnormal weather and the contagious filth from daily life. Internal causes include the heat and poison from rich wine and savory foods, and the fiery poison stemming from pent-up anger. The treatment for fire poison differs fundamentally from that for other poisons. Fire and vital energy cannot coexist; therefore, if one counteracts it with cold, the vital energy will surely flow away. For Hongxuan, there were none of these causes present; it was merely a leftover from prenatal poison. </p>
<p>All humans possess the qi of heaven and earth, which differs in purity and turpitude. Only those with pure and refined essence can enjoy boundless blessings and longevity. However, being formed from the essence of their parents, they inevitably carry mixed desires within their physical bodies. What is necessary is a resolution of these impurities through boils and sores, thus expelling the repressed desires from the body, and restoring the pure essence to its natural state. Like gold ore, it must undergo the refining process in a red furnace before the dross and the pure can finally be separated.<a id="trans-495p" href="#orig-495p" class="marker">[495p]</a></p></div>

However, if the pupil is blurred and the spiritual light is absent, then it is certainly not gold. Hong Xuan had many smallpox lesions when he was young, and his vital energy could not be revitalized; additionally, he was hindered by various other ailments. Although the fire and poison in the organs had been eliminated, the stagnation in his body still remained. Therefore, the emergence of smallpox sores must occur in the areas around the hands and feet or at the Qu pool, for these spots are devoid of any significant toxic accumulation and allow the subtle poisons to hide in places difficult for air to reach.<a id="trans-496p" href="#orig-496p" class="marker">[496p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Today’s sores and boils are precisely situated at the acupoints of the body, raising questions about the toxicity of the pox. The poison lies dormant under the elbows and armpits, posing no harm; however, the pure essence of the body is slightly mixed, akin to dust within a precious mirror or slight blemishes on a flawless jade. Now, the original energy of Taihe fills the entire body, and the residue accumulated over the past fifteen years desires to be expelled as purulent blood. Others see this as toxicity, but I have long foreseen it as a mechanism for recovery. Is it possible to be unhindered in all limbs yet not in one’s undertakings? </p>
<p>The treatment method: externally, apply a decoction of purslane to hasten its rupture; internally, use Baoyuan Decoction to facilitate complete expulsion. Additionally, using the medicinal herbs for treating pox and boils will ensure recovery on the same day, certainly unlike sores and toxins that linger for long durations. However, lacking knowledge about the diagnosis, employing cold, cooling, or fire-clearing medicines to treat the sores would merely worsen the situation. Who says minor ailments in surgery can be handled without knowledgeable intervention? If treated correctly, much purulent fluid will be expelled, and healing will occur without the need for substances that promote flesh regrowth.<a id="trans-497p" href="#orig-497p" class="marker">[497p]</a></p></div>
